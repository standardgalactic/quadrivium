About the Author
Marsha Collier spends a good deal of time on eBay. She loves buying and
selling (she’s a PowerSeller with her own eBay store) as well as meeting eBay
users from around the world. As columnist, author of three best-selling books
on eBay, and guest lecturer at eBay University, she shares her knowledge of
eBay with millions of online sellers. Thousands of eBay fans also read her
monthly newsletter, Cool eBay Tools, to keep up with the changes on the site.
eBay For Dummies is published in special versions for the United Kingdom,
Canada, Germany, and Australia. Currently, she has 15 books in print on her
favorite subject — eBay. 
Out of college, Marsha worked in Fashion Advertising for the Miami Herald
and then as Special Projects Manager for the Los Angeles Daily News. In 1984,
she founded a home-based advertising and marketing business. Her success-
ful business, the Collier Company, Inc., was featured by Entrepreneur maga-
zine in 1985 (today she’s Entrepreneur.com’s eBay columnist). Marsha’s
company later received the Small Business of the Year award from her
California State Assemblyman and the Northridge Chamber of Commerce.
Most of all, Marsha loves a great deal — that’s what drew her to eBay in 1996,
and that’s partially what keeps her busy on the site now. She buys everything
from replacement toothbrush heads to parts for pool equipment to designer
dresses. Marsha knows how to work and profit from eBay, and in this book,
she shares that knowledge with you.


Dedication
To all the future eBay buyers and sellers who have purchased this book to
get a taste of how much fun online buying and selling can be. I look forward
to seeing your auctions and hearing your stories.
I also dedicate this book to all the employees at eBay, who work very hard
and don’t always get noticed or appreciated by the community. I want to
thank all of you for your endeavors; you make eBay a fun and profitable site
to visit for millions of people. Keep on doing what you’re doing.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book couldn’t have been written without the input from thousands of
eBay sellers and buyers that I’ve spoken to from all over the country. You
inspire me to work harder and do my best to help all of you. 
I’ve made so many friends along my eBay travels. My original coauthor on the
first book, Roland Woerner: If it wasn’t for you, this book wouldn’t be here.
There’s also my close friend and eBay buddy, Jillian Cline: Thanks for trying
out all my wacky eBay ideas; I’m glad they’ve helped both of us! Thanks to the
rest of my eBay buddies — who always seem to have a moment when I call.
I particularly want to thank my editors at Wiley Publishing, Inc.: my really fun
and smart project editor Nicole Haims (who was also project editor for the
1st and 3rd editions of this book; my super tech editor Louise (aunt*patti)
Ruby (who, by the way, was one of the very first eBay employees); Barry
Childs-Helton (the best copy editor ever); Steven Hayes, who is always there
for supports and ideas; and Andy Cummings, my publisher, who  really
should be running Wiley by now — but, lucky for me — still takes my calls!
Thank you all!

Introduction
T
hanks for opening up this book. This is the newly updated version of 
the original eBay how-to guide, first published in 1999. You may soon 
be joining the hundreds of thousands of people interested in learning the no-
nonsense facts about eBay from an active user. I’m a longtime eBay shopper
and PowerSeller. My original career was in retail marketing (now it’s full-time
eBay — teaching and writing). I work from home and apply my background
successfully to all facets of the site.
Welcome to eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition! I can’t begin to tell you how excited
I am that my enthusiasm and excitement for shopping and selling on eBay
has spread to so many corners of the world. eBay users (like you and I) total
close to 200 million — that’s quite a community. It’s a community of buyers
who don’t feel the need to scour the cities for items to buy, and of sellers who
forage out wholesale items to sell online and make a few dollars. This makes
eBay the new international marketplace, and the best part is that eBay is
available to anyone who wants to take the time to figure out how it works.
eBay is a constantly evolving Web site. It isn’t too hard to master, but just as
with any tool, when you know the ins and outs, you’re ahead of the game. You
can get the deals when you shop, and when you sell, you can make the most
money. You’ve come to the right place to find out all about eBay. This book is
(and always has been) designed to help you understand the basics about
buying and selling at eBay, the most successful person-to-person trading
community. Without the basics, you can’t be successful in any endeavor. You
get all the tools you need to get moving at eBay, whether you’re new to the
Internet or a Webaholic. You see how to turn your everyday household clut-
ter into cold, hard cash — and how to look for items that you can sell at eBay.
If you’re an online shopper (or you’d like to be), I show you how to figure out
how much you should spend, how to make smart bids, and how to win the
auctions. How much money you earn (or spend) depends entirely on how
often and how smartly you conduct your eBay transactions. You decide how
often you want to run auctions and place bids; I’m here to help with the smart
part by sharing tips I’ve learned over my past ten years on eBay.
A Web site as complex as eBay has many nooks and crannies that may confuse
users. Think of this book as a detailed road map that can help you navigate
eBay, getting just as much or as little as you want from it. Unlike an actual
road map, you won’t get frustrated folding it back to its original shape. Just
close the book and come back anytime you need a question answered.

After you figure out the nuts and bolts of eBay, you can start buying and sell-
ing stuff. I have a ton of terrific buying and selling strategies that help you get
the most out of your auctions. With this book and a little elbow grease, you
can join the ranks of the millions of people who use their home computers to
make friends, find great deals, have a lot of fun, and make a profit. When you’ve
got the hang of eBay and feel that it’s time to graduate from this book, look
for my other book, Starting an eBay Business For Dummies (Wiley) — it’ll take
you to the next plateau.
About This Book
Remember those open-book tests that teachers sprang on you in high
school? Well, sometimes you may feel like eBay pop-quizzes you while you’re
online. Think of eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition, as your open-book-test cheat
sheet with all the answers. You don’t have to memorize anything; just keep
this book handy to help you get over the confusing parts of eBay. Over the
years, some of the top sellers and buyers on the eBay site have visited with
me when I’m at a book signing or teaching at eBay University just to show me
their dog-eared, highlighted, marred copy an earlier edition of eBay For
Dummies that got them started. This book will do the same for you.
With all that in mind, I’ve divided this book into pertinent sections to help
you find your answers fast. I’ll show you how to
 Get online and register at eBay.
 Navigate eBay to do just about anything you can think of — search for
items for sale, set up auctions, monitor your transactions, and join the
community circuit.
 Bid on and win eBay auctions.
 Choose an item to sell, pick the right time for your listing, market it so
that a ton of bidders see it, and make a nice profit.
 Communicate well and close deals without problems, whether you’re a
buyer or a seller.
 Handle problems with finesse, should they crop up.
 Become a part of a really unique community of people who like to col-
lect, buy, and sell items of just about every type!
Do not adjust your eyes. To protect the privacy of eBay users, screen images
(commonly called screen shots) in this book blur User IDs to protect the inno-
cent (or not so . . .).

eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Foolish Assumptions
You may have picked up this book because you heard that people are making
huge money trading at eBay and you want to find out what’s going on. Or you
heard about the bargains and wacky stuff you can find in the world’s largest
shopping emporium. If either of these assumptions is true, this is the right
book for you.
Here are some other foolish assumptions I’ve made about you:
 You have, or would like to have, access to a computer, a modem, and the
Internet so that you can do business at eBay.
 You have an interest in collecting stuff, selling stuff, and buying stuff,
and you want to find out more about doing that stuff online.
 You want tips and strategies that can save you money when you bid and
make you money when you sell. (You too? I can relate. Talk about all
things to all people!)
 You’re concerned about maintaining your privacy and staying away from
people who try to ruin everyone’s good time with negligent (and some-
times illegal) activity.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has five parts. The parts stand on their own, which means that you
can read Chapter 5 after you read Chapter 10 or skip Chapter 3 altogether. It’s
all up to you. I do think that you should at least dip into Chapter 1 and
Chapter 2 to get an overview on what eBay is all about and find out how to
become a registered user.
If you’re already conducting transactions at eBay, you certainly can jump
ahead to get good tips on advanced strategies to enhance your sales. Don’t
wait for permission from me — just go for it. I won’t argue with you that jazzy
auctions equal higher profits!
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar:
Getting a Feel for eBay
In this part, I tell you what eBay is and how you use it. I take you through the
registration process, help you organize your eBay transactions and interactions

Introduction

using the My eBay page, and get you comfortable navigating the site from the
home page.
Part II: Are You Buying 
What They’re Selling?
If you’re pretty sure you want to start making bids on items, this part gives
you the lowdown on searching, grading a collectible item’s value, research-
ing, bidding, and winning auctions.
That old cliché, “Let the buyer beware,” (caveat emptor for the literati in the
audience) became a cliché because even today (maybe especially today) it’s
sound advice. Use my friendly, sugar-free tips to help you decide when to bid
and when to take a pass.
Part III: Are You Selling 
What They’re Buying?
This part gets you up to speed on how to sell your items at eBay. Think of it
as an eBay course in marketing. Here you find important information on how
to conduct your auctions, what to do after you sell an item, how to ship the
item, and how to keep track of all the money you make. Even Uncle Sam gets
to chime in on his favorite topic: taxes. Know the rules so your friendly local
tax office doesn’t invite you over for a snack and a little audit.
I also show you how to snazzy up your auctions by adding pictures and how
to use basic HTML to link your auctions to your own home page. (If you don’t
have a home page, don’t freak out: Links are optional.) You can make your
digital images look like high art with my tips, hints, and strategies.
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! 
Special Features
Check out this part to discover how to handle privacy issues relating to eBay
and how you can resolve buying and selling issues with the help of Trust &
Safety, eBay’s problem-solving clearinghouse. Also included are ways of
having fun with the eBay community and using charity auctions to bid on
great items for a good cause.

eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part V: The Part of Tens
In keeping with a long For Dummies tradition, this part is a compendium of
short chapters that give you ready references and useful facts. I share more
terrific tips for buying and selling items, as well as descriptions of my favorite
software programs that can help lighten your auction load.
Icons Used in This Book
These are facts that you just have to know! Time is money at eBay. When you
see this shortcut or timesaver come your way, read the information and think
about all the moola you just saved.
Think of this icon as a sticky note for your brain. If you forget one of the
pearls of wisdom revealed to you, you can go back and reread it. If you still
can’t remember something here, go ahead, dog-ear the page — I won’t tell.
Even better: Use a yellow highlighter.
Don’t feel my pain. I’ve done plenty of things wrong on eBay before and want
to save you from my mistakes. I put these warnings out there bright and bold
so that you don’t have a bad experience. Don’t skip these warnings unless
you’re enthusiastic about masochism.
When you see this icon, you know you’re in for the real deal. I created this
icon especially for you to give you war stories (and success stories) from
eBay veterans (learn from their experiences is my motto) that can help you
strategize, make money, and spare you from the perils of a poorly written
auction item description. You can skip over these icons if you want to, but
you may get burned if you do.
Although the word technical sounds way too high-tech for me, you’ll find a
technical icon next to a few paragraphs in the book. Although these para-
graphs may have been deemed technical by my editors, it’s just part and
parcel of the information you’re going to need to know if you want to succeed
on eBay.
What Now?
Like everything else in the world, eBay constantly evolves. Some of the eBay
screens in this book may look slightly different than the ones you see on your
home computer display. That’s just eBay tweaking and changing things on
5
Introduction

the site. My job is to arm you with everything you need to know to join the
eBay community and begin conducting transactions. If you hit rough waters,
just look up the problem in the table of contents or index in this book. I either
help you solve it or let you know where to go at eBay for some expert advice.
Although eBay makes its complex Web site as easy to navigate as possible,
you may still need to refer back to this book for help. Don’t get frustrated if
you have to keep reviewing topics before you feel completely comfortable
trading at eBay.
After all, Albert Einstein once said, “Don’t commit to memory something you
can look up.” (Although I forget when he said that. . . .)
Two appendixes that contain excellent bonus information are available on my
Web site. Appendix A gives some insider information on how to spot a trend
before the rest of the world catches on, and how to acquire items cheaply
that others may spend a bundle on. Appendix B is an introduction to starting
your own part- or full-time business on eBay. It’s part inspiration and part
hard-learned facts. After you’ve read that and you’re ready to go to the next
level take a look at my other books, especially Starting an eBay Business 
For Dummies. It takes off where this book ends. I hope you enjoy the extra 
information — just visit www.coolebaytools.com/bonus to view the
appendixes in a PDF format.

You’ve wanted to visit eBay, maybe make a few dol-
lars selling or getting in on some of the great deals, but
eBay feels kind of big and scary. What you need is some-
one to point out the most useful tools you need to get
around, help you find out how eBay works, and start
showing you how to do your own transactions. That’s
what I do in Part I.
In this part, I give you the information you want to know
about how eBay works and what it offers its members.

e
Bay has emerged as the marketplace of the twenty-first century. In July
2003, Wired magazine predicted that eBay’s promise is that “retailing will
become the national pastime.” The founders had a pretty great idea back in
1995 (read about some eBay history in the “eBay’s humble beginnings” side-
bar later in this chapter), and the world has taken to shopping and selling
online. eBay is a safe and fun place to shop for everything from collectibles 
to brand-new clothing, all from the comfort of your home.
eBay is now also a marketplace for new merchandise. It’s no longer just the
destination for collectibles and old china patterns. These days you can pur-
chase new and useful items, such as alarm systems, fancy electronic tooth-
brushes, light bulbs, clothing, cars, homes — just about anything you can
think of.
Take a look around your house. Nice Manolos. Great-looking clock. Spiffy
microwave. Not to mention all the other cool stuff you own. All these great
fashions, household appliances, and collectibles are fabulous to own, but
when was the last time your clock turned a profit? When you connect to
eBay, your PC or Mac can magically turn into a money machine. Just visit
eBay and marvel at all the items that are just a few mouse clicks away from
being bought and sold.

In this chapter, I tell you what eBay is and how it works. eBay is the perfect
alternative to spending hours wandering through boutiques, antiques shops
or outlet malls looking for the perfect doohickey. It can also be your personal
shopper for gifts and day-to-day items. (For more information on how to match
the perfect eBay gift with one of your friends, check out my new book, Santa
Shops on eBay, also published by Wiley.)
Not only can you buy and sell stuff in the privacy of your home, but you can
also meet people who share your interests. Those who use the eBay site are a
friendly bunch, and soon you’ll be buying, selling, swapping stories, and trad-
ing advice with the best of them.
To get to eBay, you need to access the Internet. To access the Internet, you
need a computer — either a personal computer (PC) or Macintosh (Mac)
with an Internet connection, or you can get an inexpensive laptop for as little
as $299. If you’re not ready to take the high-tech plunge, this book shows you
how to start operating at eBay (and earning money) without owning a single
cyber thing.
What Is eBay, and How Does It Work?
The Internet is spawning all kinds of new businesses (known as e-commerce
to Wall Street types), and eBay is the superstar. The reason is simple: It’s the
place where buyers and sellers can meet, do business, share stories and tips,
and have fun. It’s like one giant online potluck party — but instead of bringing
a dish, you sell it!
eBay doesn’t sell a thing. Instead, the site does what all good hosts do: It 
creates a comfy environment that brings people with common interests
together. You can think of eBay like you think of the person who set you 
up on your last blind date — except the results are often a lot better. Your
matchmaking friend doesn’t perform a marriage ceremony but does get you
in the same room with your potential soul mate. eBay puts buyers and sellers
in a virtual store and lets them conduct their business safely within the rules
that eBay has established.
All you need to do to join eBay is fill out a few forms online and click.
Congratulations — you’re a member with no big fees or secret handshakes.
After you register, you can buy and sell anything that falls within the eBay
rules and regulations. (Chapter 2 eases you through the registration process.)

Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

The eBay home page, shown in Figure 1-1, is your first step to finding all the
cool stuff you can see and do at eBay. You can conduct searches, find out
what’s happening, and get an instant link to the My eBay page, which helps
you keep track of every item you have up for sale or have a bid on. You can
read more about the eBay home page in Chapter 3 and find out more about
My eBay in Chapter 4.
Yikes! What happened? The eBay home page on your computer looks nothing
like the one in Figure 1-1? Don’t rub your eyes — even squinting hard won’t
help; eBay has a different version of the home page for those who have never
registered on eBay. Even if you have never registered, someone else who uses
the computer may already have. Take a look at Figure 1-2 and see if it’s a
closer match.

eBay’s humble beginnings
The long-standing urban legend says eBay all
started with a Pez dispenser. But as romantic as
the story is (of the young man who designed the
site for his fiancé to trade Pez dispensers), the
story is, sadly, public relations spin. The founder,
Pierre Omidyar, had the right vision at the right
time, and the first item he sold on the site was a
broken laser pointer. Day by day, new people
(including me in 1996) were drawn to the site from
Internet chatter. The site eventually grew to the
point where it began to strain Pierre’s ISP. The ISP
charged him more, so he started charging a small
listing fee for sellers, just so he could break even.
Legend has it that the day $10,000 in fees arrived
in Pierre’s mailbox, he quit his day job. (I hope
that’s not apocryphal too!)
eBay was born on Labor Day, 1995. The name
eBay is taken from Echo Bay, the name Pierre
originally wanted for his company. Upon check-
ing with the State of California, he found that the
name was taken by another company, so he
shortened the name to eBay — and the rest, as
they say, is history

All About Auctions
The value of an item is determined by how much someone is willing to spend
to buy it. That’s what makes auctions exciting. eBay offers several kinds of
auctions, but for the most part, they all work the same way. An auction is a
unique sales event where the exact value of the item for sale is not known. 
As a result, there’s an element of surprise involved — not only for the bidder
(who may end up with a great deal) but also for the seller (who may end up
making a killing). Here’s how an auction works from a seller’s perspective and
a bidder’s perspective:
 Seller: A seller pays a fee, fills out an electronic form, and sets up the
auction, listing a minimum bid he or she is willing to accept for the item.
Think of an auctioneer at Sotheby’s saying, “The bidding for this dia-
mond necklace begins at $5,000.” You might want to bid $4,000, but the
bid won’t be accepted. Sellers can also set a reserve price — sort of a
financial safety net that protects them from losing money on the deal. I
explain how this stuff works later in this section.
 Bidder: Bidders in auctions duke it out over a period of time (the mini-
mum is one day, but most auctions last a week or even longer) until one
comes out victorious. Usually, the highest bidder wins. The tricky thing
about participating in an auction (and the most exciting aspect) is that
no one knows the final price an item goes for until the last second of the
auction.
eBay auctions
Unlike “traditional” live auctions that end with the familiar phrase “Going
once, going twice, sold!” eBay auctions are controlled by the clock. The seller
pays a fee and lists the item on the site for a predetermined period of time;
the highest bidder when the clock runs out takes home the prize.
Reserve-price auctions
Unlike a minimum bid, which is required in any eBay auction, a reserve price
protects sellers from having to sell an item for less than the minimum amount
they want for it. You may be surprised to see a 1968 Jaguar XKE sports car 
up for auction at eBay with a minimum bid of only a dollar. It’s a fair bet that
the seller has put a reserve price on this car to protect himself from losing
money. The reserve price allows sellers to set lower minimum bids, and
13
Chapter 1: Why eBay Is a Terrific Place to Buy and Sell

lower minimum bids attract bidders. Unfortunately, if a seller makes the
reserve price too high and it isn’t met by the end of the auction, no one wins.
eBay charges a fee for sellers to run these auctions. Nobody knows (except
the seller and the eBay computer system) what the reserve price is until the
auction is over (assuming that the reserve price is met and that someone
wins the auction), but you can tell from the auction page whether you’re deal-
ing with a reserve-price auction. Reserve-price auctions are in the listings
alongside the other items, so you have to click and option an auction to find
out whether it has a reserve. If bids have been made on an item, a message
also appears on the page telling you if the reserve price hasn’t been met. You
can find out more about bidding on reserve-price auctions in Chapter 6 and
setting up a reserve-price auction in Chapter 9.
Live Auctions
If you yearn for that traditional, “going-going-gone” (highest bidder wins) sort
of auction, you can participate in auctions that are running live at a gallery in
real time. In eBay Live Auctions, you can bid via eBay’s Internet hook-up just
as if you were sitting in a chair at the auction house. These auctions are usu-
ally for unique and interesting items that you’re not likely to find in your
locality. For more on these sales, see Chapter 6. Figure 1-3 shows the Live
Auctions home page located at www.ebay.com/liveauctions.

Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

Restricted-access auctions
If you’re over 18 years of age and interested in bidding on items of an adult
nature, eBay has an adults only (Mature Audiences) category, which has
restricted access. Although you can peruse the other eBay categories without
having to submit credit card information, you must have a credit card number
on file at eBay to view and bid on items in this category. Restricted-access auc-
tions are run like the typical timed auctions. To bid on adult items, you first
need to agree to a terms of use page after entering your User ID and password.
This page pops up automatically when you attempt to access this category.
If you aren’t interested in seeing or bidding on items of an adult nature, or if
you’re worried that your children may be able to gain access to graphic adult
material, eBay has solved that problem by excluding adult-content items
from easily accessible areas like the Featured Items page. And children under
the age of 18 aren’t allowed to register at eBay and should be under an adult’s
supervision if they do wander onto the site.
Private (shhh-it’s-a-secret) auctions
Some sellers choose to hold private auctions because they know that some
bidders may be embarrassed to be seen bidding on a box of racy neckties in
front of the rest of the eBay community. Others may go the private route
because they are selling big-ticket items and don’t want to disclose their
bidder’s financial status.
15
Chapter 1: Why eBay Is a Terrific Place to Buy and Sell
Charity auctions: All for a good cause
A charity auction is a high-profile fundraising
auction where the proceeds go to a selected
charity. Most people don’t wake up in the morn-
ing wanting to own the shoes that Ron Howard
wore when he put his footprints in cement at
Mann’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood, but one-
of-a-kind items like that often are auctioned off
in charity auctions. (In fact, someone did want
those shoes badly enough to buy them for a lot
of money at eBay.) Charity auctions became
popular after the NBC Today Show sold an
autographed jacket at eBay for over $11,000
with the proceeds going to Toys for Tots. Charity
auctions are run like most other auctions at
eBay, but because they’re immensely popular,
bidding can be fierce, and the dollar amounts
can go sky high. Many famous celebrities use
eBay to help out their favorite charities.
Billionaire Warren Buffet auctions a private
lunch each year to support one of his favorite
charities — in 2006 — it went for over $600,000.
I suggest that you visit these auctions and bid
whenever you can. Charity auctions are a win-
win situation for everyone. You can read more
about celebrity auctions in Chapter 18.

Private auctions are run like the typical timed auctions except that each
bidder’s identity is kept secret. At the end of the auction, eBay provides con-
tact info to the seller and to the high bidder, and that’s it.
You can send e-mail questions to the seller in a private auction, but you can’t
check out your competition because the auction item page shows the current
bid price but not the high bidder’s User ID.
Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions
Multiple Item — Dutch — auctions have nothing to do with windmills, wooden
shoes, or sharing the check on a date. A Multiple Item auction allows a seller
to put multiple, identical items up for sale. Instead of holding 100 separate
auctions for 100 pairs of wooden shoes, for example, a seller can sell them 
all in one listing. As a buyer, you can elect to bid for 1, 3, or all 100 pairs. But
unless you’re running an alternative boutique (or know a giant centipede who
needs all those clogs), you probably want to bid on just one pair. For more on
Multiple Item auctions, see Chapter 6.
A Multiple Item auction can’t be conducted as a private auction.
Buying It Now at eBay
You don’t have to participate in an auction at eBay to buy something. If you
want to make a purchase — if it’s something you must have — you can usu-
ally find the item and buy it immediately. Of course, using Buy It Now (BIN in
eBay speak) doesn’t come with the thrill of an auction, but purchasing an
item at a fraction of the retail price without leaving your chair or waiting for
an auction to end has its own warm and fuzzy kind of excitement. If you seek
this kind of instant gratification on eBay, visit the eBay stores. Or you can iso-
late these items by clicking the Buy It Now tab when browsing categories or
performing searches.
eBay Stores
Visiting eBay Stores is as easy as clicking the eBay Stores link from the home
page. Thousands of eBay sellers have set up stores with merchandise meant
for you to Buy It Now. eBay Stores are classified just like eBay, and you can
buy anything from socks to jewelry to appliances.
16
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

Sellers who open an eBay store have to meet a certain level of experience on
eBay, and when you buy from eBay Stores, you’re protected by the same
fraud protection policy that you are covered with in eBay auctions. 
Buy It Now and fixed-price sales
More and more sellers are selling items with a Buy It Now option or at a fixed
price. This feature enables you to buy an item as soon as you see one at a
price that suits you. For more on how these sales work, check out Chapter 6.
eBay Express
A new shopping option from eBay is called eBay Express. Just access it at
express.ebay.com and shop in a more traditional manner. It’s similar to
the other major shopping sites, where you can buy from multiple sellers in
one transaction. You pay for all your items at once and you get packages from
the individual sellers that you’ve transparently purchased from.
So You Wanna Sell Stuff
If you’re a seller, creating an auction page at eBay is as simple as filling out an
online form. You type in the name of your item and a short description, add a
crisp digital picture, set your price, and voilà — it’s auction time. (Okay, it’s a
tad more involved than that — but not much). eBay charges a small fee ($0.20
to $4.80) for the privilege. When you list your item, millions of people (eBay
has over 100 million registered users) from all over the world can take a gander
at it and place bids. With a little luck, a bidding war may break out and drive
the bids up high enough for you to turn a nice profit. After the auction, you
deal directly with the buyer, who sends you the payment either through a pay-
ment service or through the mail. Then you ship the item. Abracadabra — you
just turned your item (everyday clutter, perhaps) into cash.
You can run as many auctions as you want, all at the same time. To get info
on deciding what to sell, leaf through Chapter 9; to find out how to set up an
auction, jump to Chapter 10; and to get the scoop on advanced selling tech-
niques, visit Chapter 14. When you’re ready to go pro, check the appendixes

Chapter 1: Why eBay Is a Terrific Place to Buy and Sell

So You Wanna Buy Stuff
If you’re a collector or you just like to shop for bargains, you can browse 24
hours a day through the items up for auction in eBay’s tens of thousands of
categories, which range from Antiques to Writing Instruments. Find the item
you want, do a little research on what you’re buying and who’s selling it,
place your bid, and keep an eye on it until the auction closes. When I wrote
Santa Shops on eBay (Wiley), I had a great time visiting the different cate-
gories and buying a little something here and there — it’s amazing just how
varied the selection is. I even bought some parts for my pool cleaner!
Take a look at Chapter 5 for info on searching for items to bid on. When you
see an item you like, you can set up a bidding strategy and let the games
begin. Chapter 6 gives you bidding strategies that can make you the winner.
After you win your first auction, look for expert advice about completing the
transaction in Chapter 8.
You can bid as many times as you want on an item, and you can bid on as
many auctions as you want. Just keep in mind that each bid is a binding con-
tract that you’ll be required to pay for should you win.
Research for Fun and Profit
eBay’s awesome search engine allows you to browse through countless cate-
gories of items up for sale. As a buyer, you can do lots of comparison shop-
ping on that special something you just can’t live without or just browse
around until something catches your eye. If you’re a seller, the search engine
allows you to keep your eye on the competition and get an idea of how hot
your item is. That way, you can set a competitive price. To find out more
about using search options and categories, check out Chapters 3 and 5.
The search engine also lets you find out what other people are bidding on.
From there, you can read up on their feedback ratings (eBay’s ingenious
honor system) to get a sense of how good their reputations are — before
you deal with them.

eBay’s Role in the Action
Throughout the auction process, eBay’s computers keep tabs on what’s going
on. When the auction or sale is over, eBay takes a small percentage of the final
selling price and instructs the seller and buyer to contact each other through
e-mail. At this point, eBay’s job is pretty much over, and eBay steps aside.
Most of the time, everything works great, everybody’s happy, and eBay never
has to step back into the picture. But if you happen to run into trouble in par-
adise, eBay can help you settle the problem, whether you’re the buyer or the
seller.
eBay regulates members with a detailed system of checks and balances
known as feedback, which is described in Chapter 4. The grand plan is that
the community polices itself. Don’t get me wrong — eBay does jump in when
shady activity comes to light. But the people who keep eBay most safe are
the community members, the buyers and sellers who have a common stake
in conducting business honestly and fairly. Every time you sell something or
win an auction, eBay members have a chance to leave a comment about you.
You should do the same for them. If they’re happy, the feedback is positive;
otherwise, the feedback is negative. Either way, your feedback sticks to you
like glue.
Building a great reputation with positive feedback ensures a long and prof-
itable eBay career. Negative feedback, like multiple convictions for grand-
theft auto, is a real turnoff to most folks and can make it hard to do future
business at eBay.
If your feedback rating becomes a –4 (negative 4), eBay suspends your buying
and selling privileges. You can find out more about how eBay protects you as
a buyer or a seller in Chapter 16.
Features and Fun Stuff
So eBay is all about making money, right? Not exactly. The folks at eBay aren’t
kidding when they call it a community — a place where people with similar
interests can compare notes, argue, buy and sell, and meet each other. Yes,
people have gotten married after meeting at eBay. (Take a guess how friends
bought them wedding gifts!)
19
Chapter 1: Why eBay Is a Terrific Place to Buy and Sell

Chatting it up
eBay has dozens of specific chat rooms and discussion boards (even a Night
Owl’s Nest — for those who can’t sleep) whose topics range from advertising
to trading cards. So if you have no idea what that old Mobil gas station sign
you found in your grandfather’s barn is worth, just post a message on the
Advertising chat board. Somewhere out there is an expert with an answer for
you. Your biggest problem is deciding whether to keep the sign or put it up
for auction. Those are good problems to have! For more about posting mes-
sages and chat rooms, visit Chapters 5 and 17.
Trust & Safety
Trust & Safety is the catchall resource for information and services about
making deals at eBay safer — and for information on what to do if deals go
sour. I don’t like to think about it, but sometimes — despite your best efforts
to be a good eBay user — buyers or sellers don’t keep their word. In a small
percentage of cases, unscrupulous louts sometimes do invade the site and
try to pull scams. You may buy an item that isn’t as it was described, or the
winner of your auction doesn’t send the payment. Sometimes even honest
members get into disputes. Trust & Safety is an excellent resource when you
need questions answered or you need a professional to come in and handle
an out-of-hand situation. Chapter 16 tells you all about Trust & Safety.
Extra Gizmos You’re Gonna Want
At some point in your eBay career, you’ll become comfortable with all the com-
puter-related hoops you have to jump through to make the eBay magic happen.
At that time, you may be ready to invest in a few extra devices that can make
your eBay experiences even better. Digital cameras and scanners can help make
your time at eBay a more lucrative and fun adventure. You find out how to use
digital technology in your auctions in more detail in Chapter 14.

Chapter 2
The Bucks Start Here: 
Signing Up at eBay
In This Chapter
 Using eBay’s easy forms (the shape of things to come)
 Getting up close and personal about privacy
 Identifying with User IDs and passwords
 Learning the ropes (eBay rules and regs)
You’ve probably figured out that you sign on to eBay electronically, which
means you don’t really sign on the proverbial dotted line as folks did in
days of old before computers ran the world. Nowadays, the art of scribbling
your signature has become as outdated as vinyl records (although you can
still get vinyl records at eBay if you’re feeling nostalgic).
Compared to finding a prime parking space at the mall during the holidays,
signing up at eBay is a breeze. About the toughest thing you have to do is
type in your e-mail address correctly.
In this chapter, you find out everything you need to know about registering 
at eBay. You get tips on what information you have to disclose and what you
should keep to yourself. Don’t worry — this is an open-book test. You don’t
need to memorize state capitals, the periodic table, or multiplication tables.
Registering at eBay
You don’t have to wear one of those tacky “Hello, My Name Is” stickers on
your shirt after you sign in, but eBay needs to know some things about you
before it grants you membership. You and several million other folks will be
roaming around eBay’s online treasure trove; eBay needs to know who’s who.
So, keeping that in mind, sign in, please!

You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to register at eBay, but you can buy a
model rocket or something bigger after you do. The only hard-and-fast rule 
at eBay is that you have to be 18 years of age or older. Don’t worry, the Age
Police won’t come to your house to card you; they have other ways to dis-
creetly ensure that you’re at least 18 years old. (Hint: Credit cards do more
than satisfy account charges.) If you’re having a momentary brain cramp and
you’ve forgotten your age, just think back to the premiere of The Cosby Show.
If you can remember watching the original episodes of that favorite show of
the ’80s, you’re in. Head to the eBay home page and register. The entire
process takes only a few minutes.
Registering Is Free and Fun (And Fast)
Before you can sign up at eBay, you have to be connected to the Web. This is
the time to fire up your computer and connect to the Internet. After you open
your Internet browser, you’re ready to sign up.
Just type www.ebay.com in the address box of your browser and press Enter.
Your next stop is the eBay home page. Right there, where you can’t miss it, is
the Register Now link (it looks like a blue button, as you can see in Figure 2-1).
Click the link and let the sign-up process begin. See Chapter 3 for details.
The eBay home page changes regularly. Alternatively, it may be the home page
pictured in Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1. If you don’t see a Register Now button, look
around the page — there is always a Register button or link somewhere.
Here’s an overview:
1. Enter the basic required info.
2. Read and accept the User Agreement.
3. Confirm your e-mail address.
4. Breeze through (or past) the optional information.
The following sections fill you in on all the details.
The Registration pages on eBay are through a secure SSL connection. SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer) enables you to have an encrypted connection to eBay
because a bunch of really smart techie types made it that way. You can tell
because the normal http at the beginning of the Web address (also called the
URL) is now https. Also, you’ll see a small closed lock at the bottom-left (or
bottom-right) corner of your screen. I could tell you how SSL works, but
instead I’ll just give you the bottom line: It does work, so trust me and use it.
The more precautions eBay (and you) take, the harder it is for some hyper-
caffeinated high-school kid to get into your files.
22
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

When you’re at the Registration form, you go through a four-step process.
So, what’s your sign? Filling 
in your required information
After you click the Register button link, you’re taken to the heart of the eBay
Registration pages. You may register as a business or as an individual; I regis-
tered as an individual (even though I run a business on eBay). So if you don’t
quite have a business up and running, register simply as an individual. To get
started, follow these steps:
1. At the top of the first registration page, eBay shows the steps of the
registration process and asks you to fill in some required information.
Here’s what eBay wants to know about you:
• Your full name, address, and primary telephone number. eBay
keeps this information on file in case the company (or a member
who is a transaction partner) needs to contact you.
• Your e-mail address (yourname@myISP.com).

Chapter 2: The Bucks Start Here: Signing Up at eBay

If you register with an anonymous e-mail service such as Yahoo! Mail,
Gmail, or Hotmail, you’re taken to a page that requires additional infor-
mation for authentication. It wouldn’t surprise me if eBay will be ran-
domly authorizing all new members by requiring a credit card. (This is
for your safety.) You must provide valid credit card information for iden-
tification purposes. Your information is protected by eBay’s privacy
policy, and your credit card won’t be charged.
After you input your personal information, you’re ready to create your
eBay persona.
2. Scroll down the page to select your new eBay User ID.
See “Choosing a User ID,” later in this chapter, for some tips on selecting
your User ID.
Because many of the “good” User IDs are taken, eBay supplies a link to
check on the availability of your preferred ID. Finding an awesome User ID
can be as difficult as finding an untaken vanity plate at the California DMV.
3. Choose a password, enter it in the Create Password box, and then
type it a second time in the Re-enter Password box to confirm it.
For more information on choosing a password, see “A Quick Word about
Passwords,” later in this chapter.
4. Create your unique secret question and input the answer.
The secret question you select here is used by eBay to identify you if
you ever have problems signing in.
If eBay requires your credit card information (for identification that
you’re a real person), it will ask on the next screen.
5. Type in your date of birth.
6. Make sure all the info you entered is correct.
Think back to your second-grade teacher, who kept saying, “Class, check
your work.” Remember that? She’s still right! Review your answers.
7. Indicate that you agree to eBay’s Terms and Policies. More information
on this agreement farther on in the chapter.
If eBay finds a glitch in your registration, such as an incorrect area or zip
code, you see a warning message. This is part of eBay’s security system
to ward off fraudulent registrations. Use the Back button to correct the
information — if you put in a wrong e-mail address, for example, eBay has
no way of contacting you. So you don’t hear a peep from eBay regarding
your registration until you go through the entire process all over again.
8. Click the Continue button to move on to the next screen.
If you’ve made a mistake, eBay gives you the opportunity to correct the infor-
mation by using the Edit Information button.

Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

If you registered with an anonymous e-mail service, such as Yahoo! Mail or
Hotmail, you must enter your credit card information, as I mentioned earlier,
before you see the license agreement, which I cover in the next section. If,
when you look at it, your eyes start glazing over at all the legalese, the next
section can help you make sense of it.
Do you solemnly swear to . . . ?
During the registration you’ll be asked to check the boxes that say you agree
to the eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy. At this point, you take an
oath to keep eBay safe for democracy and commerce. You promise to play
well with others, not to cheat, and to follow the Golden Rule. No, you’re not
auditioning for a superhero club, but don’t ever forget that eBay takes this
stuff very seriously. You can be kicked off eBay or worse. (Can you say “fed-
eral investigation”?)
Be sure to read the User Agreement thoroughly when you register. So that
you don’t have to put down this riveting book to read the legalese right this
minute, I provide the nuts and bolts here:
 You understand that every transaction is a legally binding contract.
(Click the User Agreement link at the bottom of any eBay page for the
current eBay Rules and Regulations.)
 You agree that you can pay for the items you buy and the eBay fees that
you incur. (Chapter 8 fills you in on how eBay takes its cut of the auction
action.)
 You understand that you’re responsible for paying any taxes.
 You’re aware that if you sell prohibited items, eBay can forward your
personal information to law enforcement for further investigation.
(Chapter 9 explains what you can and can’t sell at eBay — and what
eBay does to sellers of prohibited items.)
 eBay makes clear that it is just a venue, which means it’s a place where
people with similar interests can meet, greet, and do business.
When everything goes well, the eBay Web site is like a school gym that opens
for Saturday swap meets. At the gym, if you don’t play by the rules, you can
get tossed out. But if you don’t play by the rules at eBay, the venue gets un-
gymlike in a hurry. eBay has the right to get state and federal officials to track
you down and prosecute you. But fair’s fair; if you click the appropriate box
on this page, eBay keeps you posted by e-mail of any updates in the User
Agreement.
25
Chapter 2: The Bucks Start Here: Signing Up at eBay

If you’re a stickler for fine print, click the links provided on the registration
page for all the Ps and Qs of the latest policies. The User Agreement is vital to
your success on eBay.
Before you can proceed, you must click the two check boxes, indicating that
you really, really understand what it means to be an eBay user. Because I know
that you, as a law-abiding eBay member, will have no problem following the
rules, go ahead and click the I Agree to These Terms button at the bottom of
the page. You’re transported to a screen stating that eBay is sending you an
e-mail. You’re almost done.
The next step is confirming your e-mail address, which I cover in the next
section.
It must be true if you have it in writing
After you accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, eBay takes less than
a minute to e-mail you an activation notice. When you receive the eBay regis-
tration activation e-mail, be sure to print it, and don’t delete the e-mail —
save it somewhere special.
With your confirmation number in hand, head back to the eBay Registration
page by clicking the link supplied in your e-mail. If your e-mail doesn’t sup-
port links, go to this address:
cgi4.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterConfirmCode
After you reconnect with eBay and it knows your e-mail address is active, you’ll
be heartily congratulated with an eBay mail, and it’s time to start shopping!
If you don’t receive your eBay registration confirmation e-mail within 24
hours, there was most likely an error in your e-mail address. At this point, the
customer-support folks can help you complete the registration process. Try
visiting the Live Help link on the eBay home page. They are always happy to
help.
If for some reason (brain cramp is a perfectly acceptable excuse) you incor-
rectly type in the wrong e-mail address, you have to start the registration
process all over again with a different User ID (eBay holds the previous ID for
30 days). If you run into a snag, you can click the Live Help button. See Figure
2-2 for my Live Help discussion.

Getting to know you: Optional information
When you’re a full-fledged, officially registered member of the eBay commu-
nity, you may see an eBay pop-up window, giving you the option to provide
more information about yourself. These optional questions allow you to fill in
your self-portrait for your new pals at eBay.
Although eBay doesn’t share member information with anyone, you don’t
have to answer the optional questions if you don’t want to.
The following points show you the optional questions eBay asks. You decide
what you feel comfortable divulging and what you want to keep personal.
eBay asks for this information because the company wants a better picture 
of who is using its Web site. In marketing mumbo-jumbo, this stuff is called
demographics — statistics that characterize a group of people who make up a
community. In this case, it’s the eBay community. Here is the optional infor-
mation you can provide:
 Gender: This first choice gets right down to the basics; some people find
it a good test of whether the requests for information seem too personal.
 Annual household income: Fill this in if you want to (eBay states that
this info is kept anonymous), but I think this information is too personal.
If you’re not comfortable with it, skip it.
 Your highest completed education level: Again if this is too personal,
leave this area blank.

After selecting your responses from the drop-down box, you can click Submit.
If you’re not in the mood right now, you can click the Answer Later link. (This
pop-up box will reappear for your response later in your eBay dealings.) If
you don’t want to answer any of the demographic queries, click the Please
Don’t Ask Me Again link at the bottom of the pop-up window.
If somebody you’re in a transaction with requests your info, you get an e-mail
from eBay giving you the name, phone number, city, and state of the person
making the request. Keep your information up to date. If you don’t, you risk
being banished from the site. See Chapter 15 for details.
A Quick Word about Passwords
Picking a good password is not as easy (but is twice as important) as it may
seem. Whoever has your password can (in effect) “be you” at eBay — running
auctions, bidding on auctions, and leaving possibly litigious feedback for
others. Basically, such an impostor can ruin your eBay career — and possibly
cause you serious financial grief.
As with any online password, you should follow these common-sense rules to
protect your privacy:
 Don’t pick anything too obvious, such as your birthday, your first name,
or (especially!) your Social Security number. (Hint: If it’s too easy to
remember, it’s probably too easy to crack.)
 Make things tough on the bad guys — combine numbers and letters (use
upper- AND lowercase) or create nonsensical words.
 Don’t give out your password to anyone — it’s like giving away the keys
to the front door of your house.
 If you ever suspect that someone has your password, immediately
change it by going to the following address:
pages.ebay.com/services/myebay/selectpass.html
 Change your password every few months just to be on the safe side.
 Don’t use the same password for eBay and PayPal.
28
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

A Not-So-Quick Word about 
Choosing a User ID
eBay gives you the option of picking your User ID. Making up a User ID is my
favorite part. If you’ve never liked your real name (or never had a nickname),
here’s your chance to correct that situation. Have fun. Consider choosing an
ID that tells a little about you. Of course, if your interests change, you may
regret too narrow a User ID.
You can call yourself just about anything; you can be silly or creative or
boring. But remember, this ID is how other eBay users will know you. So 
here are some common-sense rules:
 Don’t use a name that would embarrass your mother.
 Don’t use a name with a negative connotation, such as scam-guy.
 Don’t use a name that’s too weird. If people don’t trust you, they won’t
buy from you.
 eBay doesn’t allow spaces in User IDs, so make sure that the ID makes
sense when putting two or more words together.
If you’re dying to have several short words as your User ID, you can use
underscores or hyphens to separate them, as in super-shop-a-holic. If you sign
in to eBay permanently on your computer, typing underscores or dashes
won’t slow you down.
You can change your User ID once every 30 days if you want to, but I don’t
recommend it. People come to know you by your User ID. If you change your
ID, your past does play tagalong and attaches itself to the new ID. But if you
change your User ID too many times, people may think you’re trying to hide
something.
Nevertheless, to change your User ID, click the My eBay link at the top of
most eBay pages. From your My eBay login page, click the Preferences/Set-up
tab and scroll to the Change My User ID link, fill in the boxes, and click the
Change User ID button. You now have a new eBay identity.
eBay also has some User ID rules to live by:
 No offensive names (like &*#@@guy).
 No names with eBay in them. (It makes you look like you work for eBay,
and eBay takes a dim view of that.)
29
Chapter 2: The Bucks Start Here: Signing Up at eBay

 No names with & (even if you do have both looks&brains).
 No names with @ (like @Aboy).
 No symbols such as the greater than or less than symbols (> <) or con-
secutive underscores _ _.
 No IDs that begin with an e followed by numbers, an underscore, a dash,
a period, or a dot.
 No names of one letter (such as Q).
When you pick your User ID, make sure that it isn’t a good clue for your pass-
word. For example, if you use Natasha as your User ID, don’t pick Boris as
your password. Even Bullwinkle could figure that one out.

T
he writer Thomas Wolfe was wrong: You can go home again — and again.
At least at eBay you can! I visit the eBay home page on a regular basis; it’s
a place where I can keep up with eBay’s newest offerings. Month after month,
millions of people (just like us) land at eBay’s home page without wearing out
the welcome mat. The eBay home page is the front door to the most popular
auction site on the Internet.
Everything you need to know about navigating eBay begins right here. In this
chapter, I give you the grand tour of the areas you can reach right from the
home page with the help of links.

What Is the Home Page?
The eBay home page is shown in Figure 3-1 and includes the following key areas:
 A navigation bar at the top of the page with five eBay links that can zip
you straight to any of the many eBay areas, as well as three additional —
and powerful — links right above the navigation bar.
 A search box that helps you find items by title keywords as well as a link
to eBay’s Advanced Search page.
 A list of links to auction categories.
 Links to eBay’s specialty sites, featured auctions, fun stuff like charity
auctions, and information about what else is happening at eBay.
Do not adjust your computer monitor. You’re not going crazy. Today you may
notice that a link that was on the eBay home page yesterday is gone. That’s
normal. The links on the eBay home page change often to reflect what’s going
on — not just on the site, but in the world as well. Signing in as a guest is
simple; check out Figure 3-2.

Sign In, Please
Sign In is possibly the most powerful of all the links on the eBay pages, and it
should be your first stop if you plan on doing any business at eBay (see
Figure 3-3).
If you use the link to go to the Sign In page and then sign in, you don’t have to
continually enter your User ID throughout the site. You can set your prefer-
ences to take you directly to your My eBay page after Sign In; It’s essential for
every eBay user. (See Chapter 4 for info on My eBay.)
You can search for items on eBay without signing in, but what fun is that? eBay
has a “Guest” option. If you haven’t registered with eBay, you have access to a
special My eBay for Guests where you can keep track of items you want to keep
an eye on (Watch List) — and you can also subscribe to e-mail reminders about
your watched items. Just click the My eBay link on the navigation bar and you’re
there. When you eventually register on eBay (which I know you will), you can
transfer the watched items to your brand-spanking-new-member’s My eBay page.
If you’re the only one who uses your computer, be sure to check the box that
says Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out. This way, you’re always
signed in to eBay every time you go to the site. The Sign In process places a
cookie (a techno-related thingy — see Chapter 15 for details) on your computer

that remains a part of your computer for the rest of the day. If you don’t check
the box, you will only be signed in while your browser is open. After you close
your browser — the cookie expires, and you have to sign in again.
Here’s how to get to the eBay Sign In page and sign in:
1. Click the Sign In link below the navigation bar on any eBay page.
2. At the bottom of the new page that appears is a Secure Sign In page.
The logo indicates that your personal information is even more secure
than usual. (See Chapter 2 for details about SSL.)
3. Enter your User ID and password.
4. Click the Sign In Securely box.
You’re now signed in to eBay and can travel the site with ease. You can enter
your My eBay page by clicking the My eBay link that appears in the naviga-
tion bar. (See Chapter 4 for more on My eBay.)
This Bar Never Closes
The navigation bar is at the top of the eBay home page and lists five eBay
links that take you directly to any of the different eBay areas. Using the navi-
gation bar is kind of like doing one-stop clicking. You can find this bar at the
top of every page you visit at eBay. No matter where you are on the site,
when you click one of the five links, you go straight to a related page.
Figure 3-3:
The eBay
Sign In
page.

Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

Below the navigation bar is the Sign In / Sign Out link: This link, which toggles
between Sign In and Sign Out depending on your sign-in status, is important,
and I remind you about it throughout this book.
Think of links as expressways to specific destinations. Click a link just once,
and the next thing you know, you’re right where you want to be. You don’t
even have to answer that proverbial annoying question, “When are we gonna
get there?” from the kids in the backseat.
Here, without further ado, are the five navigation-bar buttons and where they
take you:
 Buy: Takes you to the page that lists Featured Items (see Chapter 6), all
the main eBay categories, as well as links to popular stores and eBay
promotions that vary from time to time. If you’re signed in, there is also
a link to your favorite searches and sellers. From this page, you can link
to any one of the millions of items up for auction at eBay.
Under the Buy tab, you find links to browse by categories, keywords, or
stores. If you scroll to the very bottom of the page, you find the Artist
Pages. There you can click the Music, Movies, or Books links to search
for your favorite artists’ items quickly (see Figure 3-4). If you want to find
your favorite artists’ pages even more quickly, go to artist-index.
ebay.com. On this page, they’re ranked by their standing in eBay’s Top
Sellers.

Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

When you click a link to browse a category (for example, Books:
Antiquarian & Collectible), you see some tabs above the listings. These
tabs offer you ways to search, and each tab gives you a different viewing
option to browse:
• All Items is the default setting for the page. This option delivers on
its promise — you see all items, including those up for auction and
Buy It Now items.
• Click Auctions in the tabs area to be taken to eBay’s version of an
auction catalog.
• Click the Buy It Now tab to see all items in the category that you
can buy immediately if you don’t want to wait for an auction to end.
Note that not all sellers list their items in the Auctions area, so by not
browsing All Items, you may be missing out on some special items or deals.
 Sell: Takes you to the start of the Sell Your Item form that you must fill
out to start your sales. I explain how to navigate this form in Chapter 9.
The links at the bottom of the page direct you to various Seller Guides.
 My eBay: Takes you to your personal My eBay page, where you keep
track of all your buying and selling activities, account information, and
favorite categories (there’s more about My eBay in Chapter 4).
 Community: Takes you to a page where you can find the latest news and
announcements, chat with fellow traders in the eBay community, find
charity auctions, and find out more about eBay. (Chapters 17 and 18 tell
you how to use these resources.)
 Help: Takes you to one of the most valuable areas of the eBay site. The
Help area can give you answers to many of your questions, as well as to
keep you apprised of eBay’s rules and regulations regarding trading on
the site. The eBay Help Center overview page consists of a search box,
in which you can type your query, links for help topics, an A–Z index,
and a list of the top five questions on eBay. The page offers links to the
answers to the questions most frequently asked by eBay users — and to
the Security & Resolution Center.
At the top of almost every eBay page, above the navigation bar, you find at
least three, but perhaps four small (but powerful) links that are just as impor-
tant as the links on the navigation bar:
 Home: Takes you right back the home page. Use this link from any other
page when you need to get back to the home page right away. (You can
also click the eBay logo to get to the home page.)
 Pay: When you click Pay, you go to a page that shows the last few items
you’ve won and haven’t yet paid for. Figure 3-5 shows how the items I’ve
won but have yet to pay for appear when I click the Pay link.
38
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 Register: Click here to become a member of the eBay community. If you
haven’t registered, turn to Chapter 2 to get the quick and painless facts
about the easy eBay registration process. (If you’re not signed in, the
Register link isn’t visible.)
 Site Map: Provides you with a bird’s-eye view of the eBay world. Every
top-level (that is, main) link available at eBay is listed here. If you’re ever
confused about finding a specific area, try the Site Map first. If a top-
level link isn’t listed here, it’s not at eBay — yet.
Exploring Your Home 
Page Search Options
There’s an old Chinese expression that says, “Every journey begins with the
first eBay search.” Okay, the quote’s a bit updated. Very wise words nonethe-
less. You can start a search from the home page in one of two ways:
 Use the search box. It’s right there at the top of the home page filled with
the phrase “Start New Search” and it’s a fast way of finding item listings.
 Use the Advanced Search link below the search box on the home
page. These links take you to the Advanced Search page, where you can
do all kinds of specialized searches.
Figure 3-5:
Here’s
where you
can find the
items you’ve

eBay and

them.
39
Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

Both options can give you the same results. The instructions I offer in the
next two sections about using these search methods are just the tip of the
eBay iceberg. For the inside track on how to finesse the eBay search engine
to root out just what you’re looking for, visit Chapter 5.
Peering through the home 
page’s search box
To launch a title search from the home page, follow these steps:
1. In the search box, type no more than a few keywords that describe
the item you’re looking for.
Refer to Figure 3-1 to see the search box.
2. Click the Search button.
The results of your search appear on-screen in a matter of seconds.
You can type just about anything in this box and get some information. Say
you’re looking for Star Trek memorabilia. If so, you’re not alone. The televi-
sion show premiered on September 8, 1966, and even though it was canceled
in 1969 because of low ratings, Star Trek became one of the most successful
science-fiction franchises in history. If you like Star Trek as much as I do, you
can use the search box on the eBay home page to find all sorts of Star Trek
stuff. I just ran a search and found 15,696 items — in hundreds of categories —
with Star Trek in their titles (your results will probably vary).
Try the Advanced Search link under the search box to narrow down your
search. This link takes you to the Search: Find Items page, which is explained
in the following section.
When you search for popular items at eBay (and a classic example is Star
Trek memorabilia), you may get inundated with thousands of auctions that
match your search criteria. Even if you’re traveling at warp speed, you could
spend hours checking each auction individually. (“Scotty, we need more power
now!”) If you’re pressed for time like the rest of us, eBay has not-so-mysterious
ways to narrow down your search so finding a specific item is much more
manageable. Turn to Chapter 5 for insider techniques that can help you slim
down those searches and beef up those results.
Going where Advanced 
Search link takes you
One of the most important buttons on the eBay page is the Search link. When
you click this link, you’re whisked away to the Advanced Search page, which
40
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

promptly presents you with five search options. Each option enables you to
search for information in a different way. Here’s how the search options on
the menu can work for you:
 Find Items: Search by keywords or item number. Type in the keywords
that describe an item (for example, Superman lunchbox or antique pocket
watch) and click Search, and you can see how many are available at eBay.
The site gives you the option to search by one of the main categories —
but to get the largest number of items, use All Categories and narrow
your search from the results.
Another handy way to search is by item number. Every item that’s up for
sale on eBay is assigned an item number, which is displayed next to the
item name on its page. To find an item by number, just type the number
in the box, click Search, and away you go. (To find out more about how
individual sales pages work at eBay, spin through Chapter 6.)
You can also find items by number if you type the item number into any
of the small search boxes that appear on eBay pages.
 Sort Your Searches: Here you can sort your searches in three different
ways.
 Advanced Search Link: By clicking this link, you can define your search
without using a bunch of code. It works pretty much the same as the basic
Search method, but you can exclude more features from your search. You
can also take advantage of eBay’s regional trading and find items for sale
in your neighborhood. Figure 3-6 shows the Advanced Search options.
Figure 3-6:
The
Advanced
Search
page and its
options.
41
Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

The search by category filter is a snappy new search function that helps you
figure out which subcategories have the item you want — or, if you want to
sell, helps you decide where to list your item for sale. It produces a regular
search in a selected category, but also has a column on the left side of the
page that lets you know which subcategories your item is listed in — and
how many of the item you’ll see listed in each category.
To find an item that sold at eBay in the past, indicate that you want to use the
Completed listings only search. Type in the keywords of an item, and you get a
list of items of this type that have been sold in the last 14 (or so) days, as well
as what they sold for. You can use this type of search to strategize your
asking price before you put an item up for auction (or to determine how
much you’ll have to bid to win an item).
Although Chapter 5 tells you all you need to know about searching eBay, the
following list explains some other searches that you can perform from the
Search page. In a nutshell, here’s what they do:
 Items By Seller: Every person at eBay has a personal User ID (the name
you use to conduct transactions). Use a By Seller search if you liked the
merchandise from a seller’s auction and want to see what else the seller
has for sale. Type the seller’s User ID, and you get a list of every auction
that person is running.
 Items By Bidder: For the sake of practicality and convenience, User IDs
help eBay keep track of every move a user makes at eBay. If you want to
see what a particular user (say, a fellow Star Trek fan) is bidding on, use
the Items By Bidder search. Type in a User ID in the Items By Bidder
search box, and you get a list of everything the user is currently bidding
on, as well as how much he or she is bidding. (I show you how to use
this search option as a strategic buying tool in Chapter 6.)
 Stores Search: Here’s something I bet you didn’t know: When you use
eBay’s search engine, it searches eBay stores for matching items, but
only secondarily. (I think that’s a bunch of malarkey, but who am I?) If
you search for your item here, you’ll see whether any matching items
are available in eBay stores (perhaps even at lower prices).
If you’re looking for a particular eBay store, eBay provides a search box
that allows you to search for a store by name (or part of the name).
Using eBay’s Welcome Mat
eBay welcomes new users to its home page with a yellow welcome mat — the
prominent yellow area with the blue button on the eBay home page — look
for the words Register to Bid, Buy and Save. Clicking the blue Register Now
42
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

button takes you to eBay’s registration page, one of the most important
places on eBay. (Of course, if you happen to be looking for a new welcome
mat, you’ve come to the right Web site — generally, you can find around 180
of them up for sale.)
After you register as a member of the eBay site, you may not see the welcome
mat. It’s not that eBay doesn’t welcome you. It’s just that eBay wants you to
have new information in its place when you’re familiar with the site.
You will also see a Live Help button at the top of the home page. This is the
most useful of all. By using this link, you can get into a direct conversation
with an eBay customer-service representative who can answer any of your
basic questions about the site. I show you how Live Help works in Chapter 2.
Home Links, the Next Generation
If you look carefully, you can see several other links on the home page, which
give you express service to several key parts of the site. Here are the highlights:
 Specialty Sites: Here’s where clicking a link gets you to eBay’s new spe-
cialty sites. A click on eBay Express, for example, takes you to eBay’s
new quick-shop site (www.ebayexpress.com). Clicking eBay Motors
brings you to ebaymotors.com, an area dedicated to the sale of almost
everything with a motor and wheels. eBay Stores (stores.ebay.com)
takes you to a separate area of eBay that’s loaded with thousands of
stores from eBay sellers — and eBay Stores are filled with items you can
purchase without bidding. The Live Auctions link takes you to incredibly
fun live auctions. Chapter 18 is the place to go for more info on live auc-
tions. These links grow as eBay does and can take you to interesting
places. Don’t be afraid to click around and investigate.
 Featured Items: Visit the featured items. (Translation: Sellers paid more
to have them featured in this section.)
 More eBay Sites: This box is full of links that take you to more eBay-
owned sites, such as Half.com, PayPal, ProStores, Shopping.com and
Skype (more on these sites throughout the book).
 Global Sites: Use the drop-down menu to link to the eBay international
auction sites. A quick and easy way to shop the world.
You may notice that the graphic links on the home page change from day to
day — even hour to hour. If you’re interested in the featured areas of the site,
visit this page several times a day to see the entire array of special happen-
ings at eBay.
43
Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

Maneuvering through Categories
So how does eBay keep track of the millions of items that are up for sale at any
given moment? The brilliant minds at eBay decided to group items into a nice,
neat little storage system called categories. The home page lists most of the
main categories, but currently eBay lists tens of thousands of subcategories —
ranging from Antiques to Writing Instruments. And don’t ask how many sub-
subcategories (categories within categories) eBay’s got — I can’t count that high.
Well, okay, I could list all the categories and subcategories currently available
at eBay — if you wouldn’t mind squinting at a dozen pages of really small, eye-
burning text. But a category browse is an adventure that’s unique for each indi-
vidual, and I wouldn’t think of depriving you of it. Suffice it to say that if you
like to hunt around for that perfect something, you’re in browsing heaven now.
Here’s how to navigate around the categories:
1. Click the category that interests you, such as Books or DVDs & Movies.
You’re transported to the category’s page. You see categories and sub-
categories listed next to each heading. Happy hunting.
If you don’t find a category that interests you among those on the home
page, simply click the Buy button on the navigation bar, and you’re off to
the main categories page. Not only do you get a pretty impressive page
of main categories and subcategories, but you also get a short list of fea-
tured auctions and a link to them all.
If you really and truly want to see a list of all the categories and subcate-
gories, click the See All Categories in the Category Overview link on the
main category page. Alternatively you can go to listings.ebay.com/
ListingCategoryList.
2. After the category page appears, find a subcategory underneath the
main category title that interests you. Click the subcategory, and keep
digging through the sub-subcategories until you find what you want.
For example, if you’re looking for items honoring your favorite television
show, click the Entertainment Memorabilia category. The page that comes
up includes the subcategories of the category. You will notice that the
Entertainment Memorabilia category has many links, including the Televi-
sion Memorabilia subcategory. If you look under the TV Memorabilia sub-
category head, you’ll see links to various sub-sub categories that include
Ads, Flyers, Clippings, Photos, Pins, Buttons, Posters, Press Kits, Props,
Scripts, Wardrobe, and Other. At the bottom of that page, below the links,
you also find featured auctions. Click a link to see the listings. Little icons
(pictures) next to the listings tell you more about each item — whether it’s
pictured (the camera) and whether it’s a new item (the sunrise). You can
also click the tabs to isolate Auctions only or Buy It Now items.
By the way, I have lots more to say about featured items in Chapter 10.
44
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

3. When you find an item that interests you, click the item, and the full
Auction page pops up on your screen.
Congratulations — you’ve just navigated through several million items
to find that one TV-collectible item that caught your attention. (Pardon
me while I bid on that Lily Munster/Yvonne DeCarlo–signed picture.) You
can instantly return to the home page by clicking its link at the top of
the page (or return to the Listings page by repeatedly clicking the Back
button at the top of your browser).
Near the bottom of every subcategory page, you can see a link list of num-
bers. The numbers are page numbers, and you can use them to fast-forward
through all the items in that subcategory. So, if you feel like browsing around
page 8, without going through 8 pages individually, just click number 8; you’re
presented with the items on that page (their listings, actually). Happy browsing.
If you’re a bargain hunter by habit, you may find some pretty weird stuff while
browsing the categories and subcategories of items at eBay — some of it
super-cheap and some of it (maybe) just cheap. (There’s even a Weird Stuff
category — no kidding!) Remember that (as with any marketplace) you’re
responsible for finding out as much as possible about an item before you 
buy — and definitely before you bid. So, if you’re the type who sometimes
can’t resist a good deal, ask yourself what you plan to do with the pile of
garbage you can get for 15 cents — and ask yourself now, before it arrives on
your doorstep. Chapters 6 and 7 offer more information on savvy bidding.
Going Global
Listed below the Categories list are links to eBay’s international auction sites.
You may enter eBay Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and (whew) the United Kingdom. Click one of
these links and you jet off (virtually) to eBay sites in these countries. The
international sites are in the countries’ native languages. It might be a good
place to practice your third-year French — or maybe not! Remember that
after you leave eBay USA, you’re subject to the contractual and privacy laws
of the country you’re visiting.
Using the Featured Items Links
Here at eBay, money talks pretty loudly. In the center of the home page, you
see a list of the auctions eBay is featuring at the moment. eBay usually posts
six featured items at any given time and rotates items throughout the day so
that as many sellers as possible get a shot at being in the spotlight. When you
45
Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

click the featured auction’s All Featured Items link, you’re instantly beamed
to eBay’s Home Page Featured Items section.
You can find everything from Las Vegas vacations to Model-T Fords to diet
products in the Home Page Featured Items. Home Page Featured Items are
not for mere mortals with small wallets. They’ve been lifted to the exalted
featured status because sellers shelled out lots of money to get them noticed.
All you need to get your auction featured is $39.95 ($79.95 for Multiple Item
listings), plus a second or two to click Home Page Featured Item on the Sell
Your Item form. (See Chapter 10 if you have an item that all eyes must see.)
Note that bidding on these items works the same way as bidding on regular
items.
The Home Page Featured Items page contains many expensive items. Sellers
who put up high-priced items have been around the block a few times, and
make it clear that they will verify each bid on the item. That means if you
place a bid on one of Jay Leno’s autographed Harley-Davidsons (auctioned in
2005 to benefit tsunami relief and Hurricane Katrina relief), be prepared to
get a phone call from the seller. The seller may ask you to prove that you can
actually pay for the motorcycle. Nothing personal; it’s strictly business.
Charities
Note the Giving Works (Charity) link on the home page, and you see links to
eBay charity auctions. Charity auctions are a great way for memorabilia col-
lectors to find one-of-a-kind (and authentic) items. Winning bids contribute to
programs that help charities. (Chapter 18 tells you more about what charity
items you can bid on — and the good you can do with your checkbook.)
Promotion du jour
The eBay community is constantly changing. To help you get into the swing
of things right away, eBay provides a special box with links that take you
right to the current word on the latest eBay special events.
Even if the main promotion box doesn’t appeal to you, usually you can find
some interesting links dotted around the home page without a headline. You
can find links to eBay’s special promotions for the day (or is it the hour? — it
can change every 15 minutes)
46
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

You can get there from here — lots of places, in fact:
 A rotating list of special-interest links changes at least once a day. (Half
the fun is getting a closer look at pages you haven’t seen.)
 Special money-saving offers from third-party vendors can be a boon if
you’re on the lookout for a bargain.
Bottoming Out
At the very bottom of the home page is an unassuming group of links that
provide more ways to get to some seriously handy pages. I’ve listed some
important ones below:
 Feedback Forum: This link takes you to one of the most important spots
at eBay. The Feedback Forum is where you can find out whether you’ve
forgotten to place feedback on a transaction. You can also place feed-
back, and respond to feedback left for you — all in one friendly location.
 Downloads: Here’s a place where you can download some of eBay’s
handy software. It’s a link to eBay-supplied selling-assistance software.
(See Chapter 20 for more on these programs.)
 Gift Certificates: Send anyone an eBay gift certificate for any special
occasion. You can print it out yourself, or eBay will send it to any e-mail
address you provide. The gift certificate is good for any item on the site
for the value you specify, and you can pay for it immediately with PayPal.
If the person you give the gift certificate to bids higher than the value of
the gift certificate, he or she can make up the difference using another
payment option.
 PayPal: This link takes you to the home page of PayPal, the eBay online
payment service.
 Jobs: Click here if you want to work for eBay instead of through eBay.
 Affiliates Program: If you have your own Web site and want to make a
few bucks, click this link. If you sign up for the program and put a link to
eBay on your Web page, eBay pays you $12 for any new user who signs
up directly from your Web site (plus other bonuses).
 The eBay Shop: This link enables you to browse and buy eBay merchan-
dise from the eBay company store.
 About eBay: Click this link to find out about eBay the company and to
get its press releases, company overview, and stock information. You
can also find out about eBay community activities and charities — and
even apply for a job at eBay.
47
Chapter 3: There’s No Place Like the Home Page

 Announcements: Visit the General Announcements Board when you
want to know about any late-breaking news.
 Learning Center: Click here to see eBay’s featured educational tools.
 Security and Resolution Center: This link takes you to a page where
concerns about fraud and safety are addressed. It’s such an important
eBay tool that I dedicate an entire chapter to this program. Before
buying or selling, it’s a good idea to check out Chapter 16.
 Policies: This is a good place to visit to brush up on the site’s policies
and guidelines.
 Government Relations: Here’s where your eBay membership can make
a real difference. Join eBay’s Main Street Member Program and become
involved with important legislation that may affect your online future. If
you sign up, you will receive important updates.
 Site Map. Another way to reach eBay’s very handy road map of links.
On other eBay pages, the bottom navigation bar looks a little different. It often
includes even more links so you can cruise the site quickly without necessar-
ily having to use the navigation bar.

Chapter 4
My Own Private eBay
In This Chapter
 Making the My eBay page a space to call your own
 Keeping tabs on all you’re buying and selling
 Rolling with your feedback
I
know eBay is a sensitive, touchie-feelie kind of company because it gives
all users plenty of personal space. Long preceding MySpace.com, eBay’s
My eBay page is your private listing of all your activities on eBay — sort of a
“This is your eBay life.” I think it’s the greatest organizational tool around,
and I want to talk to somebody about getting one for organizing my life out-
side of eBay.
In this chapter, you find out how you can use the My eBay page to keep tabs
on what you’re buying and selling, find out how much money you’ve spent,
and add categories to your own personalized list so that you can get to any
favorite eBay place with just a click of your mouse. You gain knowledge of the
ins and outs of feedback — what it is, why it can give you that warm, fuzzy
feeling, and how to manage it so all that cyber-positive reinforcement doesn’t
go to your head.
I do want to preface this chapter by warning you that the My eBay page has
become the hub for the zillions of features that eBay offers. As a beginner on
the site, you’ll be doing yourself a favor if you stick to the basics of the
buying, selling, feedback, and account settings. eBay’s offerings are fun, but
they will do a heck of a job confusing you when you’re just starting out. Ease
into the extras slowly.
Getting to Your My eBay Page
Using your My eBay page makes keeping track of your eBay life a whole lot
easier. And getting there is easy enough. After you enter eBay, sign in through
the Sign In link (described in Chapter 3). After you sign in to eBay, you can
access your My eBay page by clicking the My eBay box in the navigation bar
(see Figure 4-1) at the top of almost every eBay page.

If you’ve forgotten your eBay User ID or password, click the Forgot Your User
ID or Forgot Your Password link. For your User ID, you can then type in your
e-mail address, and eBay will send you an e-mail with your User ID. Your User
ID appears in any search results, posts, or pages. For the password, you have
to answer your “secret” question (the one you filled in when you registered).
If you don’t remember that, eBay will send you a password-reset e-mail if you
input your correct contact information with telephone number.
After you click the My eBay link, you arrive at your My eBay Summary page.
As you can see by my absolutely busy Summary page in Figure 4-2, you can
access just about anything you need right here. You find some handy
reminders on the center of this page. Useful buying and selling reminders
also show up here. Although when you’re involved in a large number of eBay
business, they may seem like the whining of a nagging spouse. Bottom line?
These reminders help you keep your business in control.

Look at the left side of the My eBay page. Under the My eBay Views heading
are many handy links. Actually, the links break the My eBay page into eight
main link pages, where you can view different areas of your eBay business: All
Buying, All Selling (if you haven’t sold anything as yet, this link will read Start
Selling), Want It Now, My Messages, All Favorites, My Account, My Reviews &
Guides, plus your Dispute Console. Table 4-1 gives you the scoop on these links.

All Selling
Every listing for items you’re currently selling. Also, there are
links to any listings you’ve scheduled to start at a later date, as
well as links to your Picture Manager. Most importantly, you
have links to lists of items you’ve sold (and not sold).
Want It Now
Here’s the status of your posts to the Want It Now area.
My Messages
This area links to your My Messages area, eBay’s private
e-mail service for members. My Messages is the best and
safest way to communicate with other eBay members.
All Favorites
This area links to your collections of Favorite Searches,
Favorite Sellers, and categories.
My Account
This area lets you select the activities for which you want eBay
to remember your password so that you don’t have to type it in
every time, (I like to have eBay remember your password when
I’m selling, bidding, managing items, and so on.) It also gives
you the option to change your personal information on eBay.
You can also see what you currently owe eBay. It also links to

After you get entrenched on eBay, you might want to review 
and Guides
new media (like books that you really like — hint, hint). You can
write a review álà Amazon’s reviews. Also, if you’re an expert,
you can write an online guide to share your expertise with 
the world.
Dispute Console 
If you’re ever in a dispute with either a buyer or seller regard-
ing a transaction, you can click to go to your Dispute Console
and settle things.
At the bottom of each section are important links to activities and information.

Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

Don’t confuse the My eBay page with the About Me page. The About Me page
is a personal Web page that you can create to let the world know about you
and your eBay dealings. (You don’t have to have an About Me page if you
don’t want to — but they are free for the taking and are fun to share.) I tell
you how to get your own About Me page in Chapter 14.
Keeping Track of Your Personal Business
Your My eBay page has an area called My Account. (It’s on the left side of the
page with a lot of links below it.) If you click the link to My Account, you come
to a summary page that has snippets of each topic covered in the My Account
section. It’s really better to click the individual links so that you can go directly
to the place you want to explore.
Checking your Personal Information
Here’s the very, very important area of your My eBay area. There are two links:
one for Personal Information and one for Addresses. These are the places
where you keep your contact information updated. Initially all this data comes
from your registration. But it’s policy on eBay that every user files his or her
current contact information — so if you move, change phone numbers, e-mail
addresses, or banks, you need to input that information here.

Houston, we don’t have a problem
Here’s an item I wish I’d bought: a Neil
Armstrong–signed official NASA portrait w/COA
(Certificate of Authenticity). It was a very clean
8-x-10-inch color NASA portrait signed by Neil
Armstrong, the first human on the moon. In
recent years, Armstrong has been very reclu-
sive, and his autographs are difficult to obtain in
any form. Many forgeries and reproductions are
being offered, so buyer beware. This portrait
came with a lifetime COA. The starting price
was $10, and the portrait sold on eBay in 1999
for $520!
Many believe that Neil Armstrong’s autograph
will be among the most important of the twenti-
eth century. Just think about it. He was the first
human to step onto another celestial body. This
feat may never happen again, and certainly not
in our lifetimes. When I updated this book for the
third edition, this same portrait was selling for
$650. When I checked this out the 4th edition in
2004, the picture sold for $1,925. A quick scan on
eBay today says that such a signed picture just
closed at $2,025. Why didn’t I follow my own
advice and buy one?

It’s also where you can change your User ID (if you ever decide that
Charlie18907 doesn’t really reflect your personality properly). Also, your
instant messenger name can be inserted here so that you can get IM alerts at
Yahoo! Messenger, AIM, or whatever messenger program you use; add wire-
less numbers for auctions about which you want to be notified. You can also
change your password and all your other registered information here.
On eBay you can change your User ID at any time (every 30 days), and your
feedback rating will follow.
Choosing your My eBay preferences
Because we live in a world where everyone has his or her own way of doing
things, eBay allows you to set all kinds of preferences for your eBay account.
One of the links you’ll see leads to the Preferences page. The Preferences set-
tings are all very important to your eBay tasks. You have to decide which
activities you want activated for your eBay account (you can always change
these later). The most convenient thing to do is check all the options that
make sense to you. The Notification Preferences to be set here are many:
 Notification Delivery: This is where you let eBay know which method of
notification works best for you. You can also indicate whether you want
HTML or text-based e-mails.
 Buying Notifications: Be careful here. If you indicate that you want all
this e-mail and you plan to be active on the site, prepare to be deluged.
Select wisely! But remember, you can always make changes! You can get
notifications on your shopping for the following:
• Watched Items Ending
• Watched Item Daily e-mail
• Watched Items that got relisted by the seller
• Confirmations for your bids
• E-mails when you’re outbid in an auction
• Winning buyer e-mails
• Losing bidder e-mails
• Indicate whether you choose to receive Second Chance Offers
• Personalized “new listings” Updates
As you can see, this is way too many e-mails, especially if you do a lot 
of buying and selling. For sanity’s sake, narrow your selections to the
minimum.
53
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

 Selling Notifications: If you’re selling on the site, most of these notifica-
tions will be very useful to you. You can indicate you want to receive the
following e-mails:
• Notification that you’ve saved a draft on the Sell Your Item Form
• E-mail confirmation each time you list an item for sale
• Yay! The end-of-listing e-mail when your item has sold
• Boo. The e-mail you get when your item doesn’t sell
• Notification when your buyer performs Checkout
• Monthly e-mails with your eBay seller invoices
These are all pretty important, especially when you are a new seller.
When you become more active as a seller, you might want to whittle
these down a bit — but not too much! Information is power!
 Other Transactions and Notices: Again, up to you. These can be over-
whelming. eBay gives you the option to receive e-mails in the following
areas:
• A daily status report of all your listings
• Reminders to leave feedback
• An alert when one of your feedbacks has been removed (more on
feedback later in this chapter)
Without enumerating everything else (I can see you’re about to doze off), you
can also opt in (or opt out) of eBay surveys, promotions, telephone update,
and direct USPS mail from eBay. Also (and this is very important), be sure
you’re signed up to receive any changes in eBay’s legal arena. User agreement
changes and changes to the Privacy Policy are important when transacting
business on the site.
Next on the Preferences hit parade are your actual preferences — how you’d
like to conduct business on the site. These are settings for the more advanced
seller. You can make most of these decisions on the Sell Your Item Page. If you
have time, though, click through each of the individual links to Show the
options and be sure the default settings work for you.
A setting you shouldn’t ignore is in the Other General Preferences area. Be
sure to indicate that you want the option to be able to stay signed in on your
computer during your time on eBay. Otherwise, you’ll be signing in every
time you close your eBay window. Do not indicate that you want to remain
signed in if your computer is shared by other people — you don’t want
others participating in your signed-in eBay activities!
When you finally get your My eBay page set up the way you like it, save your-
self a lot of work and time by using your browser to bookmark your My eBay
page as a favorite. Doing so saves you a lot of keystrokes later on. If you want
to send a shortcut to your desktop, in Internet Explorer choose File➪Send➪
54
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

Shortcut to Desktop. This way, you can open your browser directly onto your
My eBay page. Some eBay members make their My eBay page their browser
home page so that their My eBay page appears the minute they log on. That’s
true dedication.
Your Feedback link
Next comes your Feedback link. In the Feedback area, you see all the items
that need your feedback attention, and you can see the recent feedbacks that
have been left for you. Save yourself a trip; you can more conveniently leave
feedback from your All Selling or All Buying pages.
Account links
Not surprisingly, the My Account link leads you to more links for your PayPal
and eBay Seller accounts.
After you start selling, your Accounts pages become very powerful. Figure 4-3
shows you what the Seller Accounts section of my My eBay page is all about.
You can look up every detail of your account history, as well as make
changes to your personal preferences (such as how and when you want to
pay fees). Before you jump into the money game, you may want to review the
links that eBay gives you to manage your money:
Figure 4-3:
The Seller
Accounts
section of
my My eBay
page.
55
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

 View Account Status: Click here to get a complete explanation of your
eBay account — charges, credits, and your current balance (see Figure 4-4)
since your last invoice.
 View Invoice: Click here to see your most recent invoice and details of
the transactions.
 Make A One-Time Payment: On a single-payment basis, you may pay
with a check, money order, bank direct pay, or even from your PayPal
account. Click here and fill in the information. Even though eBay wel-
comes Visa, you may also use American Express, Discover, or
MasterCard. You can also change credit cards here at any time. Every
month, eBay charges your card for fees you incurred the previous
month. You can see these charges on your credit card statement as well
as on your eBay account.
 PayPal link: A quick click here, and you’re taken to the PayPal home
page. Check out Chapter 6 for more on the PayPal payment service.
When you give eBay your credit card information, eBay attempts to
authorize your card immediately. Your credit card company’s response,
either Declined or Approved, appears on your View Account Status page.
 Payment Terms: Although you need to post a credit card for ID pur-
poses to sell at eBay, you can pay your eBay bill in one of four ways. You
can change your method of payment at any time. See Table 4-2 to find
out when the different payments are charged to your account.
• Credit Card on File: You can place your credit card on file with
eBay so that each month eBay can place your selling charges on
your credit card. I’ve been using this format since I became an
eBay user and find that it works out very well.
• PayPal: You can make single payments directly through your
PayPal account. If you have a cash balance in your account, you

What’s that thingy?
For the first 30 days after you register or change
your User ID (which you can do anytime, as
Chapter 2 explains) — eBay gives you an icon
that stays next to your User ID every time it
appears on eBay (when you bid, run an auction,
or post a message on any of the chat boards).
So why the icon? eBay calls the graphic of a
beaming robot-like critter the “new ID” icon. It’s
sort of a friendly heads-up to others that you 
are a new user. (If you’ve changed your User ID,
the icon consists of two of the little guys with 
an arrow connecting them.) You still have all 
the privileges that everybody else has on eBay
while you’re breaking in your new identity. The
icons are nothing personal, just business as
usual.

can have it applied to your eBay bill; if not, you can pay the
amount through the credit card you’ve registered on PayPal.
• eBay Direct Pay: This form of payment allows eBay to swoop into
your personal checking account once a month and remove the
money you owe. When you sign up for this option, your bank
account is automatically debited on a predetermined day, based on
your billing cycle. Can you tell I’m not a big fan of this payment
type? I just don’t like anyone removing funds from my account
without my authorizing the withdrawal each time.
• Check or Money Order Payment: This can be a bit dodgy if you
plan to do any volume of selling on eBay. Your payment must
arrive at eBay on time. No kidding. eBay can charge you 1.5 per-
cent interest a month on the unpaid balance or just suspend your
account — not a pretty picture.
The downside of paying eBay fees by check or money order is that
you’re charged if you bounce a check, miss a payment, or use
Canadian dollars instead of U.S. dollars. You’re supposed to get an
e-mail invoice at the end of the month, but even if you don’t, eBay
expects to be paid on time. A word to the wise: Keep close tabs on
your account status if you choose to pay this way.
Figure 4-4:
Here’s a

Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

 Make a One-Time Payment: If you’re about to hit your credit limit or
you don’t want eBay making monthly charges on your credit card, you
can make a one-time payment. Check out the eBay Seller Fees area to
make a one-time payment. To pay by check, you need an eBay payment
coupon, which you can get by clicking the Mail in a Check or Money
Order link, printing out the coupon page, and following the directions. If
you want to make a one-time credit card payment, click the Pay with
Your Credit Card link; or to write a virtual e-check from your bank
account, click the Make a Direct Pay link. You’ll arrive at an SSL-secured
area to type in your information. Click Submit, and the stuff is sent to
eBay for processing. It’s just that easy.

Using the Dispute Console
If you sell an item and the buyer backs out (a rare but disheartening situa-
tion), you can at least get a refund on some of the fees that eBay charges you
as a seller. These are the Final Value Fees, and they’re based on the selling
price of the item. In this area you can keep track of the disputes in progress
and send or receive messages from the other party regarding payment.
Before you can collect a Final Value Fee refund, the following conditions must
apply:
 After your listing is over, you have to allow buyers at least three busi-
ness days to respond to you. If they don’t respond, you can send them
an e-mail politely reminding them of their commitment to buy. 
 If at least seven days have elapsed since the end of the transaction and
you have the feeling that you’re not going to see your money, you must
file an Unpaid Item Alert. After you file this notice, eBay sends you a
copy and the bidder gets an ominous e-mail reminding the bidder to
complete the transaction.
You have up to 45 days from the end of the auction to file an Unpaid Item
Alert — and you can’t get a Final Value Fee credit without filing this alert.
58
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 The next ten days after you file the Unpaid Item Alert are your “work
out” period — the period where you and the bidder hopefully complete
your transaction. You may try to give the bidder a call or e-mail through
the Dispute Console to resolve the situation during this time.
 After the ten days have passed but no more than 60 days have elapsed
since the end of the auction, you may file for a Final Value Fee credit.
If you have begun the process and filed for a Final Value Fee credit and
manage to work things out with the buyer, eBay etiquette says you should
have the Unpaid Item Alert removed from the buyer’s account. Buyers with
too many of these warnings can be suspended from using the eBay site. You
can automatically file to have this alert removed through the Dispute
Console.
Getting Your Favorites Area Together
Part of the fun of eBay is searching around for stuff that you’d never in a mil-
lion years think of looking for. Wacky stuff aside, most eBay users spend their
time hunting for specific items — say, Barbie dolls, designer dresses, plumb-
ing supplies, or U.S. stamps. That’s why eBay came up with the All Favorites
area of your My eBay page. Whenever you view your My eBay All Favorites
page, you see a list of your favorite searches, four of your favorite categories,
and a list of your favorite sellers and stores. But because eBay isn’t psychic,
you have to tell it what you want listed.
Choosing your favorite categories
You can choose only four categories to be your favorites, and with more than
50,000 categories to choose from, you need to make your choices count. If
you’re having a hard time narrowing down your category picks, don’t worry:
Your choices aren’t set in stone. You can change your Favorites list whenever
you want. (Chapter 3 offers details on eBay categories.)
To choose your favorite categories and list them on your My eBay Favorites
page, follow these steps:
1. Click the All Favorites: Categories link on your My eBay page.
2. Click the Add a New Category link on the far right side of the screen.
You see six windows, each containing category listings for four of your
category favorites. These windows contain all of eBay’s categories and
subcategories and sub-subcategories and sub-sub-subcategories.
59
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

3. In the far-left column, click the main category you want.
The column to the right automatically changes to reflect more choices
based on the main category you selected. Be sure to highlight the cate-
gories and subcategories you want, as shown in Figure 4-5.
4. Continue across from left to right (and down to the next row if indicated).
Depending on your choices, you may have to scroll through each
window to find the subcategory you’re looking for.
5. After you’ve completed your choice click Save.
You get an acknowledgment that your changes have been made. Click the
My eBay link at the top of the page to see your new favorite categories.
6. Repeat this process for Favorites Category 2 through Category 4.
If you don’t want to use all four choices, don’t bother to input any more.
How specific you get when choosing your favorites depends on how many
items you want to see. The narrower your focus, the fewer items you have to
wade through. The more general your favorites, the broader the range of
items you have to view. Just below each of your favorites are four options for
screening your favorites. Which link you choose to view auctions depends on
what kind of information you’re looking for. Whether you’re doing some pre-
liminary searching on a category or monitoring the last few days (or minutes)
of an auction, you’ll find a sorting link that best meets your needs.
Here’s a list of the sorting options in your Favorite Categories area and when
to use them. You can also use these options to browse eBay categories when
you’re in a shopping mood:
Figure 4-5:
Choosing
your favorite
categories.

Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 All Active: Shows you every item currently being auctioned in the cate-
gory, with the newest items shown first. If you want to look at all the cur-
rent auctions for a category, you end up with a gazillion pages of items
awaiting sale in a particular category for the next week.
 Starting Today: Shows you every item that was put up for auction
during the past 24 hours. The little rising sun icon next to the item tells
you that the item was listed today.
 Ending Today: Shows you every auction that is closing in the next 24
hours. The ending time is printed in red if the auction closes within the
next hour.
If you’re pressed for time, I suggest that you use the New Today link or
the Ending Today link. Both links narrow down the number of listed auc-
tions to a manageable number. For more information on narrowing down
searches at eBay, see Chapter 5.
 Ending Within Five Hours: Shows you every auction that’s ending in the
next five hours, all the way down to the last few seconds. This link offers
a great way to find items you can bid on down to the wire.
When you view auctions from the Ending Within Five Hours link, remem-
ber that eBay updates this page only every hour or so, so be sure to
read the Auction End time. (Use the eBay time conversion chart on my
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, to decipher time differences.) Due
to this same hourly update, sometimes the Ending Within Five Hours
items actually are gone — the auctions have ended.
Your favorite searches and sellers
If you shop eBay anything like I do, you’ll be looking for similar things and
sellers over and over again. The My eBay Favorites area allows you to make
note of your favorite searches and sellers. You can perform these searches
and visit these stores with a click of your mouse.
Favorite searches
You have the opportunity to list a maximum of 100 searches on the page. When
you want to repeat one of these searches, just click the Search name to search
for the items. eBay will even e-mail you all 100 of your searches when new items
are listed. (For more on that advanced function, check out Chapter 18.)
To add a search to your favorites, perform a search. (For details on how to
perform a search, see Chapter 5.) When the search appears on your screen,
click the Add to Favorite Searches link, shown in the top-right corner of
Figure 4-6.
61
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

The search is now transported to your My eBay Favorite Searches area for
that particular search, as shown in Figure 4-7. If you want to be notified by
e-mail when new items are listed, select the check box and the time frame
next to E-mail Preferences.
Favorite sellers
When you find a seller whose merchandise and prices are right up your alley
and you’d like to occasionally check out the seller’s auctions, you can list the
seller in the All Favorite Sellers area:
1. When you’ve shopped eBay and found a seller that you’re happy with,
make note of the seller’s store name or User ID.
2. Go to your My eBay Favorite Sellers/Stores area and click the Add
New Seller/Store link.
3. Type in the seller’s User ID or store name and click the Save Favorite
button.
The seller or store now appears on your My Favorite Sellers/Stores area.
To view the seller’s current auctions or visit his or her store, click the
link to the right of the seller’s name.

If you find a seller that you’d like to make a favorite while you’re browsing or
buying on the site, there is an Add to Your Favorite Sellers link in the Seller
Information box on every eBay listing.
Got the time? eBay does. Click the eBay Official Time link, which is at the
bottom of virtually every eBay page. The eBay clock is so accurate that you
can set your watch to it. And you may want to, especially if you want to place
a last-second bid before an auction closes. After all, eBay’s official time is,
um, official.
All Sorts of Sorting: Keeping 
Track of Your Items
If you want to keep tabs on the items you’re selling and bidding on (and why
wouldn’t you?), start thinking about how to sort them before you start look-
ing for the first item you want to bid on. That’s also pretty good advice for
planning your first auction.
Figure 4-7:
The Adding

Search

page.
63
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

From the My eBay page, you can sort the items you’re selling and bidding on
several ways. That gives you a lot of options to think about, dwell on, and
ponder. Each sorting method does pretty much the same thing, so pick the
one that catches your eye, and don’t lose any sleep over your choice. After
all, life’s too short — and here you can change anything by clicking the
option titles. (Wish the rest of life was like that?) Table 4-3 goes into more
detail about sorting methods.

Following the Action on Your Bidding
and Watching Pages
I have the most fun at eBay when I’m shopping. Shopping at eBay is exciting,
and I can find a zillion great bargains. Fortunately, eBay gives us a place to
keep all our shopping information together: the All Buying area.
Seeing the Items I’m Bidding On
When you bid on an item, eBay automatically lists the item in the Bidding
area of your My eBay Page. If you’re winning the auction, the price appears in
green; if you’re losing, it appears in red. After the auction’s over, the listing
moves to Items I’ve Won (yay!) or Items I Didn’t Win (boo!). You can watch
the progress of the auction from here and see the number of bids on the item,
the high bid, and how much time is left until the end of the auction. All this
information can help you decide whether you want to jump back in and make
a bid. eBay also keeps a total of all your active bids at the top of this area in
the Bidding Totals: Items I’m Bidding On page — which should hopefully help
you stay within your spending limits.
Figure 4-8:

the look of

Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

Keeping track of Items I’ve Won
When you’ve won an auction or purchased an item in a store, it appears in
the Won area. From here, you can visit the auction to print out the auction
page or double-check it. From the links in the Action column, you can also
pay for your item through PayPal direct from here; if you’ve already paid, you
can view the PayPal payment details. You can also click a Leave Feedback link
here — after you’ve received the item and are satisfied with your purchase —
to leave feedback.
Sleuthing with Items I’m Watching
Items I’m Watching is my most active area of my My eBay page (see Figure 4-9).
This is the place for you to work on your strategy for getting bargains with-
out showing your hand by bidding. In this area, you can watch the auction
evolve and decide if you want to bid on it. You can list several auctions for
the same item and watch them all develop and then bid on the one that you
can get the best deal. You can track the progress of up to 100 auctions in your
Items I’m Watching area.
Moving auctions into this area is easy. When you’ve found an item that you
want to keep track of, look for the Watch This Item (Track It in My eBay) link,
which is located just below the Item Location on the listing page. If you click
this link, the item is transported to your Items I’m Watching area.

Surveying Your Sales on Your 
My eBay Selling Page
Your My eBay page supplies you with the tools to keep track of items you’re
selling on eBay. The My eBay Selling page works very much the same as the
Bidding page, but this time you’re making the money — not spending it! Your
current auction sales are listed in the Items I’m Selling area. The items with
bids on them appear in green, and the ones without bids (or where the
reserve hasn’t been met) are in red. At the bottom, you have a dollar total of
the current bids on your auctions.
Items I’m Selling
Very much like the Items I’m Bidding On section of the All Buying section, the
Items I’m Selling area keeps track of your ongoing auctions at eBay. You can
observe the auction action in real time (or at least every time you refresh the
page). You can see how many bids have been placed, when the auction closes,
and the time left in the auction. If you want more information about what’s
going on, click the handy All Item Details link, which gives you a mini-version
of each auction (without the description).
Items I’ve Sold
When the sale is final, the items go into the Items I’ve Sold area (shown in
Figure 4-10). Here’s where you can keep track of the sale. You can check whether
the buyer has paid with PayPal and what the transaction status is. If the buyer
has completed checkout, you can get his or her information by clicking the Next
Steps/Status link. If the buyer hasn’t completed checkout, you can click the
Send Invoice button to send the buyer an invoice. Very handy!
If you haven’t heard from the buyer after three days (the prescribed eBay
deadline for contact), you may need to resend your invoice or send another
e-mail. See Chapter 12 for more information on post-sale correspondence.
After the transaction is complete (which means the item has arrived and the
buyer is happy with his or her purchase), you can click the handy Leave
Feedback link to leave feedback about the buyer.
You can also relist the item from a quick link or place a Second Chance offer
to an underbidder if you have more than one of the item. See the nearby side-
bar for more on the Second Chance feature.

Your secret seller tool — Second Chance!
Those cagey great minds at eBay have come up
with another great selling implement. Say that
you have multiples of a single item (you did sell
that set of Minton china one piece at a time,
didn’t you?) or the winning bidder backs out of
the transaction without paying. Second Chance
offer gives you the opportunity to offer the item
to one of the underbidders (okay, the losers) at
their high bid price. You can also create a
Second Chance if you set a reserve that wasn’t
met before the auction ended. The Second
Chance opportunity is available for up to 60 days
after the sale ends.
You can offer the item to as many of the under-
bidders (as you have merchandise to cover) at
a time and make this personal offer good for one
to seven days. The bidder receives an e-mail
regarding the offer and can access it on the site
through a special link. It is visible only to you
and the other bidder for the duration of the offer.
The best part is that eBay doesn’t charge any
additional listing fees for this feature, but you
are charged the Final Value Fee after the trans-
action is complete.

Keeping Track of Your Transactions
Yes, I bug you about printing stuff out — not because I’m in cahoots with the
paper industry but because I care. The eBay transaction process can be daunt-
ing, and beginners can easily lose track. The best way to protect yourself is to
keep good records on your own. Don’t depend on eBay to cover you — not that
eBay doesn’t care. But this is your money, so keep a close eye on it.
Now don’t become a pack rat and overdo it. To help point you in the right
direction, here’s a list of important documents I think you should print and
file whether you’re a buyer or a seller:
 Auction pages as they appear when they close
 Bank statements indicating any payment you receive that doesn’t clear
 Insurance or escrow forms
 Refund and credit requests
 Receipts from purchases you make for items to sell on eBay
Always, always, always save every e-mail message you receive about a trans-
action, whether you buy or sell. Also save your EOAs (End of Auction e-mails)
that eBay sends. For more information about EOAs and correspondence eti-
quette after the auction is over, see Chapters 8 and 12.
Why should you save all this stuff? Here are some reasons:
 Even if you’re buying and selling just a couple of items a month on eBay,
you need to keep track of who you owe and who owes you money.
 Good e-mail correspondence is a learned art, but if you reference item
numbers, your e-mail is an instant record. If you put your dates in 
writing — and follow up — you have a nice, neat paper trail.

Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

 Documenting the transaction through e-mail will come in handy if you
ever end up in a dispute over the terms of the sale.
 If you sell specialized items, you can keep track of trends and who your
frequent buyers are.
 Someday the IRS may come knocking on your door, especially if you buy
stuff for the purpose of selling it on eBay. Scary, but true. For more on
where you can get tax information, take a look at Chapter 9.
When it comes to keeping records via e-mail and documents about transac-
tions, I say that after you’ve received your feedback (positive, of course), you
can dump it. If you get negative feedback (how could you?), hang on to your
paperwork for a little longer. Use your discretion, but generally you can toss
the paperwork from a bad transaction after it has reached some sort of reso-
lution. (You can find out more about feedback in the next section.)
Once a month, do a seller search on yourself and print out your latest eBay
history. Chapter 5 tells you more about doing seller searches, organizing your
searches, and starting files on items you want to track.
Getting and Giving Feedback
You know how they say you are what you eat? At eBay, you are only as good
as your feedback says you are. Your feedback is made up of comments —
good, bad, or neutral — that people leave about you (and you leave about
others). In effect, people are commenting on your overall professionalism.
(Even if you’re an eBay hobbyist with no thought of using it professionally, a
little businesslike courtesy can ease your transactions with everyone.) These
comments are the basis for your eBay reputation.
Because feedback is so important to your reputation on eBay, you don’t want
others leaving feedback or making bad transactions under your name. The
only way to ensure this doesn’t happen is to always keep your password a
secret. If you suspect somebody may know your password, change it before
that person has a chance to sign in as you and ruin your reputation. (For more
on selecting and protecting your level of privacy, see Chapters 1 and 15.)
When you get your first feedback, the number that appears next to your User
ID is your feedback rating, which follows you everywhere you go at eBay,
even if you change your User ID or e-mail address. It sticks to you like glue.
Click the number next to any User ID and get a complete look at the user’s
feedback profile. The thinking behind the feedback concept is that you
wouldn’t be caught dead in a store that has a lousy reputation, so why on
Earth would you want to do business on the Internet with someone who has
a lousy reputation?
70
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

You’re not required to leave feedback, but because it’s the benchmark by
which all eBay users are judged, whether you’re buying or selling, you should
always leave feedback comments. Get in the frame of mind that every time
you complete a transaction — the minute the package arrives safely if you’re
a seller or an item you’ve bid on and won arrives — you should go to eBay
and post your feedback.
Every time you get a positive comment from a user who hasn’t commented
on you before, you get a point. Every time you get a negative rating, this neg-
ative cancels out one of your positives. Neutral comments rate a zero — they
have no impact either way. eBay even has what it calls the Star Chart, shown in
Figure 4-11, which rewards those with good-and-getting-higher feedback ratings.
The flip side (or Dark Side to you Star Wars fans) of the star system is nega-
tive numbers. Negative comments deduct from your total of positive com-
ments, thereby lowering the number beside your User ID. eBay riddle: When
is more than one still one? Gotcha, huh? The answer is, when you get more
than one feedback message from the same person. Confused? This should
help: You can sell one person 100 different items, but even if the buyer gives
you a glowing review 100 times, your feedback rating doesn’t increase by 100.
In this case, the other 99 feedback comments appear in your feedback profile,
but your rating increases only by one. There’s one other thing: Say you sell to
the same eBay user twice. The user can give you positive feedback in one
case and negative feedback in another case — neutralizing your feedback by
netting you a 0 feedback rating from this person. eBay set up the system this
way to keep things honest.
Anyone with a –4 rating has his or her eBay membership terminated.
Remember, just because a user may have a 750 feedback rating, it doesn’t
hurt to click the number after the name to double-check the person’s eBay ID
card. Even if someone has a total of 1,000 feedback messages, 250 of them
could be negative.

Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

You can get to your personal feedback profile page right from your My eBay
page by clicking the number next to your User ID.
Feedback comes in three exciting flavors:
 Positive feedback: Someone once said, “All you have is your reputa-
tion.” Reputation is what makes eBay function. If the transaction works
well, you get positive feedback; whenever it’s warranted, you should
give it right back.
 Negative feedback: If there’s a glitch (for instance, it takes six months 
to get your Charlie’s Angels lunchbox or the seller substitutes a rusty
thermos for the one you bid on or you never get the item), you have the
right — some would say obligation — to leave negative feedback.
 Neutral feedback: You can leave neutral feedback if you feel so-so about
a specific transaction. It’s the middle-of-the-road comment. Say you
bought an item that had a little more wear and tear on it than the seller
indicated, but you still like it and want to keep it.
How to get positive feedback
If you’re selling, here’s how to get a good reputation:
 Establish contact with the buyer (pronto!) after the auction ends (see
Chapter 12).
 After you’ve received payment, send the item quickly (see Chapter 12).
 Make sure that your item is exactly the way you described it (see
Chapter 10).
 Package the item well and ship it with care (see Chapter 12).
 React quickly and appropriately to problems — for example, the item’s lost
or damaged in the mail, or the buyer is slow in paying (see Chapter 12).
If you’re buying, try these good-rep tips:
 Send your payment fast (see Chapter 8).
 Keep in touch via e-mail with the seller (see Chapter 8).
 Work with the seller to resolve any problems in a courteous manner (see
Chapters 8 and 12).
How to get negative feedback
If you’re selling, here’s what to do to tarnish your name big time:
72
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 Tell a major fib in the item description. (Defend truth, justice, and legiti-
mate creative writing — see Chapter 10.)
 Take the money but “forget” to ship the item. (Who did you say you are?
See Chapter 16.)
 Package the item poorly so that it ends up smashed, squashed, or vapor-
ized during shipping. (To avoid this pathetic fate, see Chapter 12.)
If you’re buying, here’s how to make your status a serious mess:
 Bid on an item, win the auction, and never respond to the seller.
(Remember your manners and see Chapter 6.)
 Send a personal check that bounces and never make good on the pay-
ment. (See Chapter 16 — and don’t pass Go.)
 Ask the seller for a refund because you just don’t like the item.
(Remember how to play fair and see Chapter 8.)
The Feedback page
When you click the Feedback number next to a member’s User ID, you’ll see all
the tools you need to gauge the member. Think of your feedback profile as your
eBay report card. Your goal is to get straight As — in this case, all positive feed-
back. Unlike a real report card, you don’t have to bring it home to be signed.
When someone clicks the feedback number next to your User ID, they see the
following information (see Figure 4-12):
 Your User ID: Your eBay nickname appears, followed by a number in
parentheses — the net number of the positive feedback comments
you’ve received, minus any negative feedback comments you may have
gotten (but that wouldn’t happen to you . . .).
 Your membership information: Listed here is the date you first signed
up as a member of the eBay community. Beneath that is the country
from which you’re registered, your star rating (refer to Figure 4-11), and
any icons leading to more areas related to you on eBay, like your About
Me page (see Chapter 14). This area also notes whether you are a
PowerSeller (see Chapter 20) and whether you have an eBay Store. 
 Your overall profile makeup: This area sums up the positive, negative,
and neutral feedback comments people have left for you.
 Your Member Profile with a summary of most recent comments: This
area is a scorecard of your feedback for the last 12 months. At the bottom
of the feedback tote board is a summary of your bid retractions in the
past six months — the times you have retracted bids during an auction.
73
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay

Be careful when you retract a bid. All bids on eBay are binding, but under
what eBay calls “exceptional circumstances,” you may retract bids — very
sparingly. Here are the circumstances in which it’s okay to retract a bid:
 If you’ve mistakenly put in the wrong bid amount — say, $100 instead of $10
 If the seller adds to his or her description after you’ve placed your bid,
and the change considerably affects the item
 If you can’t contact the seller (your e-mail continuously bounces back
and the phone number doesn’t work)
You can’t retract a bid just because you found the item elsewhere cheaper or
you changed your mind or you decided that you really can’t afford the item.
See Chapter 6 for more information on retracting bids.
Reading your feedback
Your eBay reputation is at the mercy of the one-liners that buyers and sellers
leave for you in the form of feedback comments.

74
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

Each feedback box contains these reputation-building (or -trashing) ingredients:
 The User ID of the person who sent it. The number in parentheses next
to the person’s name is his or her own feedback rating.
 The date and time the feedback was posted.
 The item number of the transaction that the feedback refers to. If the
item has closed in the past 30 days, you can click the transaction
number to see what the buyer purchased.
 Seller or Buyer — indicating whether you were the seller or the buyer in
the transaction.
 Feedback bullets come in different colors: praise (in green with a plus
mark), negative (in red with a minus mark), or neutral (in grey with a
white dot).
 The feedback the person left about you.
You have the last word — 
responding to feedback
After reading feedback you’ve received from others, you may feel compelled
to respond. If the feedback is negative, you may want to defend yourself. If
it’s positive, you may want to say thank you.
75
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay
Extra, extra, read all about it
Normally, I believe in the adage, “Keep your
business private.” But not when it comes to
feedback. The default setting is for public view-
ing of your feedback. This way, everyone at
eBay can read all about you.
If you want to make your feedback a private
matter, you need to go to the Feedback Forum
(click the Feedback link under the My Account
heading of the My eBay page. Then click the Go
to Feedback Forum link. The link you need to
click from there is the Hide my Feedback link.
Hiding your feedback is a bad idea. You want
people to know that you’re trustworthy; being
honest and upfront is the way to go. If you hide
your feedback profile, people may suspect that
you’re covering up bad things. It’s in your best
interest to let the spotlight shine on your feed-
back history.
It’s your reputation, your money, and your expe-
rience as an eBay member. Keep in mind that all
three are always linked.

To respond to feedback, follow these steps:
1. Click the link to the Feedback section of your My eBay page, and then
click the Go to Feedback Forum link at the top of the page.
You’re transported to the Feedback Forum, where you can follow up and
reply to feedback comments left for you.
2. Click the appropriate link, depending on whether you want to Reply
to feedback received or follow up to feedback left. Find the feedback
you want to respond to and click the Reply or Follow Up link.
3. Type in your response.
Do not confuse replying to feedback with leaving feedback. Replying does not
change the other user’s feedback rating; it merely adds a line below the feed-
back with your response.
Leaving feedback with finesse
Writing feedback well takes some practice. It isn’t a matter of saying things;
it’s a matter of saying only the appropriate things. Think carefully about what
you want to say because once you submit feedback, it stays with the person
for the duration of his or her eBay career. I think you should always leave
feedback, especially at the end of a transaction, although doing so isn’t
mandatory. Think of leaving feedback as voting in an election: If you don’t
leave feedback, you can’t complain about lousy service.
eBay says to make feedback “factual and emotionless.” You won’t go wrong if
you comment on the details (either good or bad) of the transaction. If you
have any questions about what eBay says about feedback, click the Feedback
link on your My eBay page and then click the Go to Feedback Forum link.
In the Feedback Forum, you can perform six feedback-related tasks:
 See feedback about an eBay user.
 Leave feedback for many auctions at once. Here, you see all pending
feedback for all transactions within the past 90 days. You are presented
with a page of all your transactions for which you haven’t left feedback.
Fill them in, one at a time, and with one click, you can leave as many as
25 feedback comments at once.
 Review and respond to existing feedback about you.
 Review the feedback you have left for others. Here, you may also leave
follow-up feedback after the initial feedback should situations change.
76
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 Make your feedback profile public or private. Remember, if you make
your feedback profile private, you may hinder your future business on
eBay. See the sidebar “Extra, extra, read all about it,” elsewhere in this
chapter.
 Check the Feedback FAQ to review any changes in the feedback
system.
In the real world (at least in the modern American version of it), anybody 
can sue anybody else for slander or libel; this fact holds true on the Internet,
too. It’s a good idea to be careful not to make any comments that could be
libelous or slanderous. eBay is not responsible for your actions, so if you’re
sued because of negative feedback (or anything else you’ve written), you’re
on your own. The best way to keep yourself safe is to stick to the facts and
don’t get personal.
77
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay
Mincing words: The at-a-glance guide 
to keeping feedback short
eBay likes to keep things simple. If you want to
compliment, complain, or take the middle road,
you have to do it in 80 characters or less. That
means your comment needs to be short and
sweet (or short and sour if it’s negative, or
sweet and sour if you’re mixing drinks or order-
ing Chinese food). If you have a lot to say but
you’re stumped about how to say it, here are a
few examples for any occasion. String them
together or mix and match!
Positive feedback:
 Very professional
 Quick e-mail response
 Fast service
 A+++
 Good communication
 Exactly as described
 Highly recommended
 Smooth transaction
 Would deal with again
 An asset to eBay
 I’ll be back!
Negative feedback:
 Never responded
 Never paid for item
 Check bounced, never made good
 Beware track record
 Not as described
 Watch out — you won’t get paid
Neutral feedback:
 Slow to ship but item as described
 Item not as described but seller made good
 Paid w/MO (money order) after check
bounced
 Poor communication but item came OK

If you’re angry, take a breather before you type out your complaints and click
the Leave Comment button. If you’re convinced that negative feedback is nec-
essary, try a cooling-off period before you send comments. Wait an hour or a
day and then see whether you feel the same. Nasty feedback based on emo-
tion can make you look vindictive (even if what you’re saying is true).
Safety tips for giving feedback
And speaking of safety features you should know about feedback, you may
want to study up on these:
 Remember that feedback, whether good or bad, is sticky. eBay won’t
remove your feedback comment if you change your mind later. Be sure
of your facts and carefully consider what you want to say.
 Before you leave feedback, see what other people had to say about that
person. See whether what you’re thinking is in line with the comments
others have left.
 Your feedback comment can be left as long as the transaction remains
on the eBay server. This is usually within 90 days of the end of the auc-
tion. After 90 days have passed, you must have the transaction number
to leave feedback.
 Your comment can only be a maximum of 80 letters long, which is really
short when you have a lot to say. Before you start typing, organize your
thoughts and use common abbreviations to save precious space.
 Before posting negative feedback, try to resolve the problem by e-mail
or telephone. You may discover that your reaction to the transaction is
based on a misunderstanding that can be easily resolved.
 eBay users generally want to make each other happy, so use negative
feedback only as a last resort. See Chapters 8 and 10 for more details on
how to avoid negative feedback.
If you do leave a negative comment that you later regret, you can’t remove it.
You can go back to follow up and leave an explanation or a more positive
comment (but it won’t change the initial feedback or rating), so think twice
before you blast.
The ways to leave feedback
Several ways are available to leave feedback comments:
 If you’re on the user’s Feedback page, click the Leave Feedback link; the
Leave Feedback page appears.
 In the Items I’ve Won area of your My eBay page, click the Leave
Feedback link next to the auction.
78
Part I: Forget the Bricks and Mortar: Getting a Feel for eBay 

 Go to your auction and click the Leave Feedback icon.
 In the Feedback Forum, click the Leave Feedback link to see a list of all
your completed auctions from the last 90 days for which you haven’t yet
left feedback.
To leave feedback, follow these steps:
1. Enter the required information.
Note that your item number is usually filled in, but if you’re placing 
feedback from the user’s Feedback page, you need to have the number
at hand.
2. Choose whether you want your feedback to be positive, negative, or
neutral.
3. Click the Leave Feedback button.
79
Chapter 4: My Own Private eBay
eBay will consider removing feedback if . . .
 eBay is served with a court order stating
that the feedback in question is slanderous,
libelous, defamatory, or otherwise illegal.
eBay will also accept a settlement agree-
ment from a resolved lawsuit submitted by
both attorneys and signed by both parties.
 Negative feedback can be expunged when
both parties agree that it was left in error by
filing for a Mutual Feedback Removal. Click
the Feedback Disputes link on the Feedback
Forum page.
 The feedback in question has no relation to
eBay — such as comments about transac-
tions outside of eBay or personal comments
about users.
 The feedback contains a link to another
page, picture, or JavaScript.
 The feedback is comprised of profane or
vulgar language.
 The feedback contains any personal identi-
fying information about a user.
 The feedback refers to any investigation,
whether by eBay or a law-enforcement
organization.
 The feedback is left by a user who supplied
fraudulent information when registering at
eBay.
 The feedback is left by a person who can be
identified as a minor.
 The feedback is left by a user as a part of
harassment.
 The feedback is intended for another user,
when eBay has been informed of the situa-
tion and the same feedback has been left
for the appropriate user.

tion you need to start bidding and winning auctions.
Although eBay is a lot more fun than school, you still have
to do your homework. After you’ve registered to become
an eBay member (in Part I), you can place a bid on any
item you see. But first you have to find the item that’s
right for you . . . and then maybe find out what it’s worth.
And what happens when you win?!
In this part, I show you how to find the items you want
without sifting through every single one of eBay’s millions
of auctions. I also give you an insider’s look at determining
the value of a collectible, determining how much you’re
willing to spend, and using the right strategy to win the
item at just the right price. When the auction is over,
follow my advice to make closing the deal go smooth as
silk. Watch the positive feedback come pouring in.

Consider also walking into a store with thousands of aisles of shelves with

you find is actually what you seek.
Of course, searching is easier if you have an idea of what you’re looking for. In
this chapter, for collectors, I offer first-time buyers some expert tips and tell
you how to get expert advice from eBay and other sources. I also give you
tips for using the eBay search engine from a buyer’s perspective.
The best advice you can follow as you explore any free-market system is
caveat emptor — let the buyer beware. Although nobody can guarantee that
every one of your transactions will be perfect, research items thoroughly
before you bid so that you don’t lose too much of your hard-earned money —
or too much sleep.

General Online Tips for Collectors
If you’re just starting out on eBay, chances are you like to shop and you also
collect items that interest you. You’ll find out pretty early in your eBay adven-
tures that a lot of people online know as much about collecting as they do
about bidding — and some are serious contenders.
How can you compete? Well, in addition to having a well-planned bidding
strategy (covered in Chapter 7), knowing your stuff gives you a winning edge.
I’ve gathered the opinions of two collecting experts to get the info you need
about online collecting basics. (If you’re already an expert collector but want
some help finding that perfect something at eBay so you can get ready to bid,
you’ve got it. See “Looking to Find an Item? Start Your eBay Search Engine,”
later in this chapter.) I also show you how one of those experts puts the infor-
mation into practice, and I give you a crash course on how items for sale are
(or should be) graded.
Although these tips from the experts are targeted for collectors, much of the
information is sound advice for those involved in any transaction online.

This hearse sold in 1999 at eBay for $600. It

with only 57,000 miles! Retired in 2002, this baby
sold for $7,400! For this edition, I had to up my

columnist and collectibles dealer who operates Lee Bernstein Books and
Collectibles from her home base in Schererville, Indiana, authors a monthly
column for the New England Antiques Journal. She also offers Attic Muse, a
free, quarterly online newsletter that helps collectors buy, sell, and avoid
making mistakes, and is the author of eBay’s Collectibles “Inside Scoop.” Bill
and Lee offer these tips to collectors new to eBay:
 Get all the facts before you put your money down. Study the descrip-
tion carefully. It’s your job to analyze the description and make your bid-
ding decisions accordingly. Find out whether all original parts are
included and whether the item has any flaws. If the description says that
the Fred Flintstone figurine has a cracked back, e-mail the seller for
more information on just how cracked Fred really is.
 Don’t get caught up in the emotional thrill of bidding. First-time
buyers (known as Under-10s or newbies because they have fewer than
ten transactions under their belts) tend to bid wildly, using emotions
instead of brains. If you’re new to eBay, you can get burned if you just
bid for the thrill of victory without thinking about what you’re doing.
I can’t stress how important it is to determine an item’s value, whether
collectible or new. But because values are such flighty things (values
depend on supply and demand, market trends, and all sorts of other
variables), I recommend that you get a general idea of the item’s value
and use this ballpark figure to set a maximum amount of money you’re
willing to bid for that item. Then stick to your maximum and don’t even
think about bidding past it. If the bidding gets too hot, there’s always
another auction. To find out more about bidding strategies, Chapter 7 is
just the ticket.
 Know what the item should cost. Buyers used to depend on price guides —
books on collectibles and their values — to help them bid. Bill says that
price guides are becoming a thing of the past. Sure, you can find a guide
that says an original Lion King Broadway poster in excellent condition
has a book price of $150, but if you do a search at eBay, you’ll see that
they’re actually selling for $65 to $75.
When your search on eBay turns up what you’re looking for, average out
the current prices that you find. Also check the completed listings.
Doing so gives you a much better idea of what you need to spend than
any price guide can.
 Timing is everything, and being first costs. If you’re into movie posters,
for example, consider this: If you can wait three to six months after a
movie is released, you can get the poster for 40 to 50 percent less. The
same goes for many new releases of collectibles. Sometimes you’re wiser
to wait and save money.
 Be careful of presell items. Sometimes you may run across vendors sell-
ing items that they don’t have in stock but that they’ll ship to you later.
For example, before Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came out,
some vendors ran auctions on movie posters they didn’t have yet. If you
85
Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research

had bid and won, and for some reason the vendor had a problem getting
the poster, you’d have been out of luck. Don’t bid on anything that can’t
be delivered as soon as you pay for the item. See some of eBay’s presale
rules later in this chapter.
 Being too late can also cost. Many collectibles become more difficult to
find as time goes by. Generally, as scarcity increases, so does desirability
and value. Common sense tells you that if two original and identical col-
lectibles are offered side by side, with one in like-new condition and the
other in used condition, the like-new item will have the higher value.
 Check out the seller. Check the feedback rating (the number in paren-
theses next to the person’s User ID) a seller has before you buy. If the
seller has many comments with a minute number of negative ones,
chances are good that this is a reputable seller. For more on feedback,
check out Chapter 4.
Although eBay forbids side deals, an unsuccessful bidder may (at his or
her own risk) contact a seller after an auction is over to see if the seller
has more of the item in stock. If the seller is an experienced eBay user (a
high feedback rating is usually a tip-off) and is interested in the bidder’s
proposition, he or she may consider selling directly to a buyer. Suggest
to the seller that if he or she puts the duplicate item up for sale on eBay
you’ll purchase it immediately with a Buy-It-Now price. eBay strictly pro-
hibits selling items off the site. If you conduct a side deal and are reported
to eBay, you can be suspended. Not only that, but buyers who are ripped
off by sellers in away-from-eBay transactions shouldn’t look to eBay to
bail them out. You’re on your own. The eBay-legal way to purchase these
items is by asking the seller to post another of the item for you — or if
you were an underbidder in the auction, send you a Second Chance
offer. That way, you’re also protected by the many eBay and PayPal
buyer protections.
 If an item comes to you broken in the mail, contact the seller to work
it out. The best bet is to request shipping insurance (you pay for it)
before the seller ships the item. But if you didn’t ask for insurance, it
never hurts to ask for a discount (or a replacement item, if available) if
you’re not satisfied. Chapter 12 offers the lowdown on buying shipping
insurance, and Chapter 16 provides pointers on dealing with transac-
tions that go sour.
Go, Joe: Following an expert on the hunt
Bill looks for specific traits when he buys his very collectible GI JOE figures.
Although his checklist is specific to the GI JOE from 1964 to 1969, the infor-
mation here can help you determine your maximum bid on other collectibles
(or whether an item is even worth bidding on) before an auction begins. As
you find out in Chapter 7, the more you know before you place a bid, the 
86
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

happier you’re likely to be when you win. Bill’s checklist can save you consid-
erable hassle:
 Find out the item’s overall condition. For GI JOE, look at the painted
hair and eyebrows. Expect some wear, but overall, a collectible worth
bidding on should look good.
 Be sure the item’s working parts are indeed working. Most GI JOE
action figures from this period have cracks on the legs and arms, but the
joints should move, and any cracks should not be so deep that the legs
and arms fall apart easily.
 Ask if the item has its original parts. Because you can’t really examine
actual items in detail before buying, e-mail the seller with specific ques-
tions relating to original or replacement parts. Many GI JOE action fig-
ures are rebuilt from parts that are not from 1964 to 1969. Sometimes the
figures even have two left or right hands or feet! If you make it clear with
the seller before you buy that you want a toy with only original parts,
you’ll be able to make a good case for a refund if the item arrives rebuilt
as the Six Million Dollar Man. Chapter 7 has plenty of tips on how to pro-
tect yourself before you bid, and Chapter 16 has tips on what to do if the
deal goes bad.
 Ask if the item has original accessories. A GI JOE from 1964 to 1969
should have his original dog tags, boots, and uniform. If any of these
items are missing, you will have to pay around $25 to replace each 
missing item. If you’re looking to bid on any other collectible, know in
advance what accessories came as standard equipment with the item, or
you’ll be paying extra just to bring it back to its original version.
 Know an item’s value before you bid. A 1964 to 1969 vintage GI JOE in
decent shape, with all its parts, sells for $300 to $400 without its original
box. (Mint-in-box Joes can sell for thousands of dollars.) If you’re bid-
ding on a GI JOE action figure at eBay and you’re in this price range,
you’re okay. If you get the item for less than $300, congratulations —
you’ve nabbed a bargain.
 If you have any questions, ask them before you bid. Check collectors’
guides, research similar auctions at eBay, and visit one of eBay’s cate-
gory chat rooms.
Making the grade
Welcome to my version of grade school without the bad lunch. One of the
keys to establishing value is knowing an item’s condition, typically referred to
as an item’s grade. Table 5-1 lists the most common grading categories that
collectors use. The information in this table is used with permission from
(and appreciation to) Lee Bernstein.

Finding More Research Information
Hey, the experts have been buying, selling, and trading collectible items for
years. But just because you’re new to eBay doesn’t mean you have to be a
newbie for decades before you can start bartering with the collecting gods. I
wouldn’t leave you in the cold like that — and neither would eBay. You can
get information on items you’re interested in, as well as good collecting tips,
right at the eBay Web site. Visit the Category-Specific Discussion Boards in
the Community area. You can also search the rest of the Web or go the old-
fashioned route and check the library (yes, libraries are still around).
Keep in mind that there are truly several prices for an item. The retail (or
manufacturer’s suggested retail price — MSRP) price, the “book” value, the
secondary market price (the price charged by resellers when an item is
unavailable on the primary retail market), and the eBay selling price. The
only way to ascertain the price an item will go for on eBay is to research com-
pleted auctions. Later in this chapter, I give you the skinny on how to
research a completed auction.
Searching sites online
If you don’t find the information you need at eBay, don’t go ballistic — just go
elsewhere. Even a site as vast as eBay doesn’t have a monopoly on informa-
tion. The Internet is filled with Web sites and Internet auction sites that can
give you price comparisons and information about cyberclubs.
89
Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research

Your home computer can connect to powerful outside servers (really big
computers on the Internet) that have their own fast-searching systems called
search engines. Remember, if something is out there and you need it, you can
find it right from your home PC in just a matter of seconds. Here are the
addresses of some of the Web’s most highly regarded search engines or multi-
search-engine sites:
 AltaVista (www.altavista.com)
 Dogpile (www.dogpile.com)
 Ask (www.ask.com)
 Google (www.google.com)
 Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
The basic process of getting information from an Internet search engine is
pretty simple:
1. Type the address of the search-engine site in the Address box of your
Web browser.
You’re taken to the Web site’s home page.
2. Find the text box next to the button labeled Search or something similar.
3. In the text box, type a few words indicating what interests you.
90
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 
Getting professional info from 
Marketplace Research
If you become an eBay fanatic someday, you
may find yourself praising the genius of an
amazing service offered by eBay. Marketplace
Research allows you to research pricing further
back than the 14 days of completed listings that
the normal eBay search allows. This way, if
you’ve come across a special or very old item,
and there are not many on the site, you can use
this tool to find how much the item has sold for
in the past couple of months. You can find
Marketplace Research at www.ebay.com/
marketplace_research.
As with most of eBay’s special features, there is
an extra charge to use the service. But, the
price is right, and you only have to pay for the
service as long as you need it. eBay prices it as
follows: a FastPass (good for 2 days) is $2.99; a
monthly use is available for $9.99 a month; and
for extended history, you can get the pro version
for $24.99. The main difference between the
basic version and the pro version is that basic
users can access up to 63 days (9 weeks) of his-
torical data, while Pro users can access to up
91 days (13 weeks) of historical data. In my (not
so) humble opinion, 91 days is an eternity in
Internet time — what sold well three months
ago may be worth bupkis now. You can search
for a lot of items in the 2-day, $2.99 FastPass ver-
sion. That’s the one I recommend.

Be specific when typing in search text. The more precise your entry, the
better your chances of finding what you want. Look for tips, an
advanced search option, or help pages on your search engine of choice
for more information about how to narrow your search.
4. Click the Search (or similar) button or press Enter on your keyboard.
The search engine presents you with a list of how many Internet pages
have the requested information. The list includes brief descriptions and
links to the first group of pages. You’ll find links to additional listings at
the bottom if your search finds more listings than can fit on one page
(and if you ask for something popular, like Harry Potter, don’t be sur-
prised to get millions of hits).
Always approach information on the Web with caution. Not everyone is the
expert he or she would like to be. Your best bet is to get lots of different opin-
ions and then boil ’em down to what makes sense to you. And remember —
caveat emptor. (Is there an echo in here?)
Many people out here on the West Coast buy cars on eBay. (Could it be
because cars are way more expensive out here? Maybe.) If you’re researching
prices to buy a car on eBay, look in your local newspaper to get a good idea
of prices in your community. Several good sites are on the Internet. My per-
sonal favorite is www.nadaguides.com. I’ve had many of my friends (and
editors) visit the various sites, and we’ve settled on this one because it
seems to give the most accurate and unbiased information.
Finding other sources of information
If you’re interested in collecting a particular item, you can get a lot of insider
collecting information without digging too deep:
 Go to other places at eBay. eBay’s chat rooms and message boards
(covered in detail in Chapter 17) are full of insider info. The eBay com-
munity is always willing to educate a newbie.
 Go to the library. Books and magazines are great sources of info. At
least one book or one magazine probably specializes in your chosen
item. For example, if old furniture is your thing, Antiquing For Dummies,
by Ron Zoglin and Deborah Shouse (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), can clue you
in to what antiques collectors look for.
If you find an interesting specialty magazine at the library, try entering
the title in your search engine of choice. You may just find that the mag-
azine has also gone paperless: You can read it online.
 Go to someone else in the know. Friends, clubs, and organizations in
your area can give you a lot of info. Ask your local antiques dealer about
clubs you can join and see how much info you end up with.

Looking to Find an Item? Start 
Your eBay Search Engine
The best part about shopping on eBay is that, aside from collectibles, you
can find just about everything from that esoteric lithium battery to new
designer dresses (with matching shoes) to pneumatic jackhammers. New or
used, it’s all here — if you can find it hiding in the (get this!) 6 million new
daily listings. (According to eBay, 89 million listings are on the site worldwide
at any given time. That’s a lot of gavels being banged!)
Finding the nuggets (deals) can be like searching for the proverbial needle in
the haystack. The search secrets in this chapter will put you head and shoul-
ders above your competition for the deals.
eBay has lots of cool ways for you to search for items (sample ’em in Chapter 3).
Although eBay allows you to search by item number, let’s be realistic here.
You saw what I said a couple of paragraphs back about the number of active
listings. I can’t remember my own phone number, let alone an item number
(and I never write them down correctly). Look for those numbers to get
longer and longer as eBay continues to grow in popularity. Four main options
are the most useful for researching:
 Search Title (or Search Title and Description)
 Search Items by Seller
 Search Items by Bidder
 Search Items in eBay Stores
92
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 
Testing, testing . . . how long 
does a search take at eBay?
Having a massive search engine is a matter of
necessity at eBay — millions of items are up for
auction at any given time — and often, an easy,
fast search makes all the difference between
getting and not getting. After all, time is money,
and eBay members tend to be movers and shak-
ers who don’t like standing still.
So how long do searches really take at eBay? I
put it to the test. In the Search window of the
eBay home page, I typed in 1933 Chicago
World’s Fair Pennant and let ’er rip.
The search engine went through about 89 mil-
lion general items and World’s Fair items (860 of
them in 1999, 1,200 items in 2003 and over 2,100
in 2006!) and gave me my one specific item in
just 4 seconds. (Now, if the wizards at eBay
could only figure out a way to find that sock that
always escapes from clothes dryers, they’d
really be on to something.)
By the way, in 1999 that slightly wrinkled felt
pennant got four bids and sold for $17.50; in 2003,
the aging pennant sold for $43.88 with eight bids.

You can access the four search options by clicking the Advanced Search link
below the Search box at the top of any eBay. Each search option can provide
a different piece of information to help you find the right item from the right
seller at the right price.
If you plan to repeat specific eBay searches, I recommend that you conduct
searches often by saving them in your My eBay Favorite Searches area (see
Chapter 18 to find out how). And when you find a particularly juicy item or
subcategory, bookmark it, or if it’s an item, click Watch This Item (a link on
the auction page just under the item number), or use your My eBay page.
(See Chapter 18 for more on eBay’s personal shopper.)
Using the eBay Search page
When you click the Advanced Search link below the Search box, the Search
page appears. It’s the most basic of searches (with a few options) and the one
you’ll be using the most. (To get the really advanced features, you must click
the Advanced Search link at the bottom of the page.)
When you use any of the Search options on eBay, the search engine looks for
every listing (auction or fixed price) that has the words you’re looking for in
the title or the description (if you specify so). The title (as you may expect) is
just another word or group of words for what you call the item. For example,
if you’re looking for an antique sterling iced-tea spoon, just type sterling iced
tea spoon into the search window (see Figure 5-1). If someone is selling a
sterling iced-tea spoon and used exactly those words in his or her title or
description, you’re in Fat City.
Before you click the Search button, narrow down your search further. When
you type in your search title, you have the option of choosing how you want
the search engine to interpret your search entry. You can have the search
engine search the title and description for
 All the words you type
 Some of the words you type
 The exact phrase in the order you’ve written it
When you’re familiar with the tricks listed later in this chapter, you’ll be able
to get most of these fancy Search results in one of the many search boxes you
see littered around the eBay site.
93
Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research

In addition, you can find other useful criteria on the Advanced Search page
(more on this further on):
 What price range you want to see: Type in the price range you’re look-
ing for, and eBay searches the specific range between that low and high
price. If money is no object, leave this box blank.
 Items by price: If you don’t want to spend more than $25 for your spoon,
you can indicate to your search to ignore any items above that price.
 Words to exclude: If you want to find a sterling iced-tea spoon, but you
don’t want it to be plated silver, exclude the word plated.
 From sellers: You can exclude (or include) particular sellers. If you’d
like, you can just search sellers from your Favorite Sellers list (but why?).
 The payment: You may restrict your search to items that accept PayPal.
 Within a category: Use this option if you want to limit your search to a
particular main (or top-level) category, for example, instead of searching
all eBay categories.
 The item location: You can narrow your search to the United States
only, North America, or worldwide. Depending on your item, this search
criteria can help weed out the most esoteric items. If you’re looking for
hefty items (like an elliptical exercise machine that will probably end up
as a place to hang clothes) that would cost much too much to ship, you
can specify how many miles from your zip code (or any zip) you will
allow the search to extend.
 The order in which you want your results to appear: If you indicate
Items Ending First, the search engine gives you the results so that auc-
tions closing soon appear first on the list. Newly Listed Items First lists
all the newly listed auctions. Lowest Prices First and Highest Prices First
list them just that way.
 Whether you want the search engine to check through item titles
alone or check both item titles and item descriptions: You will get
more hits on your search if you select the Search Title and Description
check box, but you may also get too many items that are out of your
search range. See “Narrowing down your eBay search,” later in this
chapter, for some solid advice.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Okay, now click the Search button (see Figure 5-2). In a few seconds, you see
the fruits of all the work you’ve been doing. (Wow, you’re not even perspiring.)
You may notice that eBay has some Related Searches listed under the Search
Box on your Results page. Be sure to click the links, because eBay’s search
functions can often be a bit temperamental — and you don’t want to miss any
great deals.
Next to item listings you often see pictures, or icons. A golden yellow rising
sun picture means the listing is brand new (this icon stays on for the first 24
hours an item is listed), a small camera means the seller has included a digi-
tal picture along with the item description; if you see a little picture, the
seller chose to use the Gallery.
If you ever see a mysterious icon in a listing (eBay makes up new icons from
time to time), just click the picture with your mouse, and you’ll be taken to a
help page that describes the icon’s meaning.
An easy way to keep track of an auction you’re interested in is to click the
Watch This Item link at the top right of the auction page. The auction is then
listed on your My eBay Items I’m Watching page, and you can keep your eyes
on the action.
On the left side of the results page is a list of categories that your search term
is listed under, which is a great reference. Next to each category is a number
Figure 5-2:

in parentheses that tells you how many times your search item appears in
that category. Figure 5-3 shows a sample of the category spread. To view the
items appearing only in a particular category, click that category (or subcate-
gory) title.
eBay’s Advanced Search
The Advanced Search page of the search area throws quite a few more
options into the package. Don’t be intimidated by this area; you need to
understand just a few important bells and whistles.
A Completed Items search
A Completed Items search returns results of auctions that have already
ended. This is my favorite search option at eBay because you can use it as a
strategic bidding tool. How? If you’re bidding on an item and want to know if
the prices are likely to go too high for your pocketbook, you can use this
search option to compare the current price of the item to the selling price of
similar items from auctions that have already ended.
You can also use this tool if you want to sell an item and are trying to deter-
mine what it’s worth, how high the demand is, and whether this is the right
time to list the item. (Chapter 10 offers the nuts, bolts, and monkey wrenches
you need to set up your auction.)
Figure 5-3:

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Type in your keyword criteria and scroll down the page to the Completed Items
Only box. Step by step, here’s how to do a Completed Items Only search:
1. In the title search field, type in the title name or the keywords of the
item you want to find.
2. Select the Completed Items Only check box to see completed listings
as far back as the eBay search engine will permit.
Currently, you can go back about two weeks.
3. Tell eBay how you want the results arranged.
In the Sort By area, choose one of the following four options:
• Items Ending First: Include completed auctions starting with the
oldest available (about two weeks).
• Newly Listed: List the most recently completed auctions first.
• Lowest Prices First: List auctions from the lowest price attained to
the highest price paid for an item.
• Highest Prices First: List completed items from highest to lowest.
(This is a very useful option when you’re searching for a 1967
Camaro and you want to buy a car and not a Hot Wheels toy.)
4. Click Search.
The search results appear in just a few seconds.
An alternate way to find completed items is to run a current auction search from
any of the little search boxes on almost any eBay page. When the results of your
auction show up, scroll down to the Display box in the left column and click the
Completed Items link, as shown in Figure 5-4. That way, you can scout out the
active auction competition quickly before moving on to the completed sales.
An international search
You can select any country (from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, no kidding!) or
narrow your search to the United States or Canada. Don’t forget that you have
to pay for shipping, so if you don’t want to pay to ship a heavy Victorian-style
fainting sofa from Hungary to Hoboken, New Jersey, stick close to home. The
Location/International Search option is pretty much an international version
of Search, and it’s done the same way. You also have the choice of narrowing
down your country search with the following options:
 Items Available To: The search engine looks for items within your own
country or from international sellers willing to ship to you.
 Items Located In: The search engine looks for items from the specific
country you entered in the box.
97
Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research

A seller search
The By Seller link in the search area, shown in Figure 5-5, gives you a list of 
all the items a seller is selling, and it’s a great way for you to keep tabs on
people you have successfully done business with in the past. The By Seller
page is also a strategy that eBay users use to assess the reputation of a seller.
You can find out more about selling strategies in Chapter 9.
View all items by a single seller
To use the By Seller search option to search for all of a single seller’s items,
follow these steps:
1. In the Single Seller search field, type the eBay User ID of the person
you want to learn more about.
2. If you don’t want to see auctions that this specific seller has conducted
in the past, select No on the Include Completed Items line.
You can choose to see all current and previous auctions, as well as auc-
tions that have ended in the last day, last two days, last week, or last two
weeks.
eBay keeps past auction results active for only 30 days; if you’re looking
for something auctioned 31 days (or longer) ago, sorry — no dice.

3. On the Sort By line, select an option to control how you want the
results of your search to appear on-screen.
If you want to see the auctions that are closing right away, select
Auction End.
4. Choose the number of results you want to see per page.
If the person you’re looking up has 100 auctions running, you can limit
the number of results to a manageable 25 listings on four separate
pages. Doing so allows you to narrow down what you want to see.
5. Click the Search button next to the Single Seller text box.
Figure 5-6 shows the results page of a By Seller search.
Finding items by keywords for multiple sellers
If you’re looking for a specific item from a group of sellers, you can fill the
search information in the bottom half of the By Seller search page, as shown
earlier in Figure 5-5. You may need to perform this type of search after you
settle into shopping on eBay and have several sellers that you like doing busi-
ness with (or alternatively, you can exclude sellers you prefer not to do busi-
ness with). With this method, you can limit the search for a particular item to
just the sellers you want, rather than tens of thousands of sellers.
When you find a seller that you want to continue doing business with, you
can add his or her link to your My eBay Favorite Sellers area. Just go to your
My eBay page, and in the Favorites area, click the Add New Seller/Store link.
You can add up to 30 sellers in this area, and can search their sales with a
click of your mouse!

A bidder search
The By Bidder search option is unique because sellers and buyers alike use it
when an auction is going on — to figure out their best strategies. After all,
money is the name of the game. For information on conducting a By Bidder
search, take a look at Chapter 7.
Narrowing down your eBay search
After you become familiar with each of eBay’s search options, you need a
crash course in what words to actually type into those nice little boxes. Too
little information and you may not find your item. Too much and you’re over-
whelmed with information. If you’re really into bean-bag toys, for example,
you may be looking for Ty’s Tabasco the Bull. But if you just search for Tabasco,
you’ll get swamped with results ranging from hot sauce to advertisements.
Some simple tricks can help narrow your eBay search results when you’re
searching from pages other than the main Search page (where you don’t find
all the searching bells and whistles). Table 5-2 has the details.

Chapter 5: Seek and You Shall Find: Research

Here are additional tips to help you narrow down any eBay search:
 Don’t worry about capitalization: You can capitalize proper names or
leave them lowercase — the search engine doesn’t care.
 Don’t use and, a, an, or, or the: Called noise words in search lingo, these
words are interpreted as part of your search. So if you want to find some-
thing from The Sound of Music and you type in the sound of music, you
may not get any results. Most sellers drop noise words from the begin-
ning of an item title when they list it, just as libraries drop noise words
when they alphabetize books. So make your search for sound music. An
even more precise search would be “sound of music” (in quotes).
 Search within specific categories: This type of search narrows down
your results because you search only one niche of eBay — just the spe-
cific area you want. For example, if you want to find Tabasco the Bull,
start at the home page and, under the Categories heading, click Toys
and Bean Bag. The only problem with searching in a specific category is
that sometimes an item can be in more than one place. For example, if
you’re searching for a Mickey Mouse infant snuggly in the Disney cate-
gory, you may miss it because the item might be listed in infant wear. It’s
best not to limit yourself to a category because some of the best deals
are miscategorized by sellers. What makes them such a good deal is that
not everyone can find them. But you know better.
Use the asterisk symbol often to locate misspellings. I’ve often found some
great deals by finding items incorrectly posted by the sellers. Here are a few
examples:
 Rodri* In this search I look for items by the famous Cajun artist George
Rodrigue. His Blue Dog paintings are world renowned and very valuable.
By using this search, I managed to purchase a signed Blue Dog litho-
graph for under $200. (I resold it on eBay later that year for $900!)
 Alumi* tree Remember the old aluminum Christmas trees from the ’60s?
They’ve had quite a resurgence in popularity these days. You can buy
these “antiques” in stores for hundreds of dollars . . . or you can buy one
on eBay for half the price. You can find them even cheaper if the seller
can’t spell aluminum. . . .
 Cemet* plot If you’re looking for that final place to retire, eBay has some
great deals. Unfortunately, sellers haven’t narrowed down whether they
want to spell it cemetery or cemetary. This search will find both.
After studying these examples, I’m sure you can think of many more instances
in which your use of the asterisk can help you find the deals. Be sure to e-mail
me and let me know when you find something special in this way!

Free hanging chads . . .
eBay gives you the opportunity to have the same
fine museum-quality items as the Smithsonian
Institution. In November 2001, the Palm Beach
County Board of County Commissioners found
themselves in a bit of a pickle. Due to the 
infamous Presidential election of November 7,
2000 — fraught with hanging, pregnant, and
dimpled chads — the announcement of the
election winner was delayed for an unprece-
dented 37 days. As a result of this election, the
Florida legislature outlawed the future use of
punch-card voting systems — all Florida coun-
ties had to move to more stable, state-approved
voting machines.
Palm Beach County chose to move to a touch-
screen type of voting device, which cost its res-
idents over $14 million. What to do with the old
historic punch-card voting machines? Yep,
donate one to the Smithsonian — and auction
the rest off on eBay. Palm Beach County
donated machine #1 to the Auction for America;
it netted $4,550.01 for the Twin Towers fund.
The rest? Well, the Palm Beach County folks
should have read this book. They ran a Dutch
auction for 3,055 of the basic voting packages,
with a starting bid of $300. Included with the
voting machine was the iniquitous “butterfly
ballot” with official stylus; a brass plaque cer-
tifying that it was used in the November 7 
election; a Certificate of Authenticity signed by
Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County Supervisor
of Elections; 25 demonstrator punch cards for
playing polling place at home; a signed photo-
graph of the folks in charge of recounting 
the ballots: Palm Beach County Supervisor 
of Elections Theresa LePore, Palm Beach
County Commissioner Carol Roberts, and Judge
Charles Burton; and “any chads which are in
the machine from previous elections.” What a
package! There also were 569 Premier pack-
ages, which included an Official Ballot box,
starting at $600.
In the 10-day auctions (run at the same time!),
Palm Beach County sold 78 of the Premier pack-
ages and 389 of the Basic voting-machine pack-
ages. I called the County Commissioner’s office
to find out why my voting machine hadn’t
arrived and asked when the rest would be auc-
tioned. I was assured they would be put back up
at eBay auction, but at a higher starting bid.
Palm Beach County should have followed the
strategies in this book, like some smart eBay
sellers did. Soon after, one of the basic pack-
ages sold after a 7-day auction for $670. Other
entrepreneurial sellers have been selling voting
machines from counties other than Palm Beach
on eBay. Unfortunately for those who purchase
them, only the Palm Beach County machines
had the infamous, butterfly ballot.

Here’s how to find people or get info on them from eBay:
1. From the top of most eBay pages, click the Advanced Search link.
This action takes you to the main Search page where three links appear
on the left side of the page, under Members:Find a Member.
2. Click the Find a Member link in the box on the left side of the page.
This link takes you to the main Find Members page, where you can
search for other members of the community. When you find the member,
you can see his or her About Me page (see Chapter 14 to find out how to
create your own personal eBay Web page). You can also get a look at the
feedback profile of a user (see Chapter 4 for details about feedback),
find User ID histories of fellow eBay members (which comes in handy
when you’re bidding on items, as Chapter 7 avows), or get contact infor-
mation when you’re involved in a transaction.
If you’re involved in a transaction with another eBay member and feel that
you need to contact the individual by phone, click the link Find Contact
Information link, which is under the Members heading on the left side of the
screen. On that page you’ll need to type in the transaction number along with
the other person’s User ID. eBay compares this data with yours, and if you
are indeed involved in a transaction with each other, eBay e-mails you the
other person’s phone number (along with the person’s full name, city, and
state). Your contact information is, in turn, sent to the other party.
Clicking the arrow in the Favorite Searches drop-down box at the top right of
the page allows you to scroll through your My eBay Favorite Searches. You
can tell eBay about the items you’re looking for, and it does automatic searches
for you. You can also have eBay e-mail you when auctions that match your
descriptions crop up. (Chapter 18 gives you more info on how this works.)

rowsing different categories of eBay, looking for nothing in particular,
you spot that must-have item lurking among other Elvis paraphernalia
in the Collectibles category. Sure, you can live without that faux gold Elvis
pocket watch, but life would be so much sweeter with it. And even if it doesn’t
keep good time, at least it’ll be right twice a day.
When you bid for items on eBay, you can get that same thrill that you would
get at Sotheby’s or Christie’s for a lot less money, and the items you win are
likely to be slightly more practical than an old Dutch masterpiece you’re afraid
to leave at the framer’s. (Hey, you have to have a watch, and Elvis is the King.)
In this chapter, I give you the lowdown about the types of auctions and fixed-
price listings available on eBay and a rundown of the nuts and bolts of bid-
ding strategies. I also share some tried-and-true tips that’ll give you a leg up
on the competition.
The Auction Item Page
Because at any given point, you have more than a million pages of items that
you can look at on eBay, auction item pages are the heart (better yet, the
skeleton) of eBay listings. All item pages on eBay — whether auctions, fixed-
price items, or Buy It Now items — look about the same. For example,
Figure 6-1 shows a conventional auction item page, and Figure 6-2 shows a

fixed-price sale. Both item pages show the listing title at the top, bidding or
buying info in the middle, and seller info on the right. Below this area you
find a complete description of the item, along with shipping information.
Of course, the two auction types have some subtle differences. Some auc-
tions feature a picture at the top of the page, and some don’t, depending on
how the seller sets up his or her sale page. Some auctions have set item
specifics in the description (as shown in Figure 6-2). This area is set up by
eBay and filled in by the seller to give you a snapshot description of the item
for sale. If you search for an item and end up finding it available in a fixed-
price sale, won’t see the Place Bid button (also shown in Figure 6-2). But
overall, the look and feel of these pages is the same.
Here’s a list of stuff you see as you scroll down on a typical auction
item page:
 Item title and number: The title and number identify the item. Keep
track of this info for inquiries later on.
If you’re interested in a particular type of item, take note of the key
words used in the title (you’re likely to see them again in future titles).
Doing so helps you narrow down future searches.
 Item category: Located just above the item title and number bar, you
can click the category listing and do some comparison shopping.
(Chapter 5 gives more searching strategies.)

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

 Current Bid: This field indicates the dollar amount the bidding has
reached, which changes throughout the auction as people place bids. If
no bids have been placed on the item, this field is called Starting Bid.
Sometimes, next to the current dollar amount, you see (Reserve not
met). This statement means that the seller has set a reserve price for the
item — a secret price that must be reached before the seller will sell the
item. If you don’t see this note on an auction item page, don’t be
alarmed. Not all auctions have reserve prices. In fact, the majority don’t.
Also, the moment a reserve is met, the indicator disappears completely.
 Buy It Now price: If you want the item immediately and the price quoted
in this area is okay with you, click the Buy It Now link, which takes you
to a page where you can complete your purchase.
 Quantity: This field appears only in a multiple item fixed-price sale or
Dutch auction. It tells you how many items are available. If you see a
number other than 1 in this field, you’re looking at a Multiple Item
(Dutch) auction, which is explained later in this chapter. It may also
be a multiple unit, fixed-price sale (which means that you can buy just
one — you don’t have to buy the entire lot). You can tell if it’s a

Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

fixed-price sale because you have no opportunity to bid, you can just
use the Buy It Now option for whatever quantity of the item you desire.
You’ll be prompted for a quantity when you buy. But if a seller is selling
two Elvis watches for the price of one, the item quantity still shows up
as 1 (as in 1 set of 2 watches).
 Time Left: Although the clock never stops ticking at eBay, you must con-
tinue to refresh your browser to see the time remaining on the official
clock. When the item gets down to the last hour of the auction, you’ll see
the time expressed in minutes and seconds. This field tells you the time
remaining in this particular auction.
Timing is the key in an eBay bidding strategy (covered in Chapter 7).
Because eBay’s world headquarters is in California, eBay uses Pacific
Standard Time or Pacific Daylight Time as the standard, depending on
the season. Not a major deal if you live on the West Coast like I do, but it
can be an issue if you live anywhere else.
 History: This field tells you how many bids have been placed. To use the
number of bids to your advantage, you have to read between the lines.
You can determine just how “hot” an item is by comparing the number
of bids the item has received over time. Based on the amount of interest
in an item, you can create a time strategy (which I talk about later in this
chapter). If you want to see the starting bid, you have to click the Show
Listing and Payment Details link at the bottom of the screen (refer to
Figure 6-1). If you click the number of bids link next to the word History,
you can find out who is bidding and what date and time bids were
placed on this item. The dollar amount of each bid is shown in the bid-
ding history, but bidders’ maximum bids are kept secret. 
 High Bidder: This field shows you the User ID and feedback rating of the
current high bidder. It could be you if you’ve placed a bid!
Bidding is more an art than a science. Sometimes an item gets no bids
because everyone’s waiting until the last minute. You see a flurry of
activity as bidders all try to outbid each other (called sniping, which
Chapter 7 explains). But that’s all part of the fun of eBay.
 Item Location: This field tells you at the very least the country where
the seller is located, and you may also see more specific info, such as
the city and geographic area where the seller is. (What you see depends
on how detailed the seller wants to be.) 
Factor in the geographic location of a seller when you consider bidding
on an item. Knowing exactly where the item is can help you quickly cal-
culate approximately how long it will take for the item to get to you.
(Chapter 10 tackles that subject.) Also, if you buy from someone in your
own state, you may also have to pay sales tax on your purchase. If the
item is in Australia, for example, and you’re in Vermont, you may decide
that you don’t really need that wrought-iron doorstop. (Remember, you
pay the shipping charges.)
108
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

 Watch This Item: Click this link to magically add the item to the All
Buying section of your My eBay page. From there, you can keep an eye
on the progress of the auction — without actually bidding. If you haven’t
signed in, you have to type in your User ID and password before you can
save the auction to your My eBay page.
Be sure to use the Watch This Item feature. Organization is the name of
the game at eBay, especially if you plan to bid on multiple auctions while
you’re running auctions of your own. I figure you’re in the bidding game
to win, so start keeping track of items now.
 E-mail to a Friend: You can tip off a friend on a good find, get some
advice from an antiques or collecting expert, or run the auction by a
friend who’s been around the eBay block a few times and ask for strat-
egy advice. (You find this link at the top of the listing page next to the
Watch This Item link or way down below where you place the bid.)
 Get Alerts: Using a sniping service is more my style, but Get Alerts is
great for those do-it-yourselfers out there. So if you really enjoy the thrill
of the bid, the Get Alerts option enables you to receive a notification if
you’re outbid and (or) when the auction is about to end. There are three
versions of notices:
• Text messages: You can get an SMS message direct to your cell-
phone. You will be charged $0.25 for up to ten messages per item.
After ten messages for an item, the charges increase another $0.25
for the next ten messages. The charges appear on your mobile
phone bill listed as eBay services.
Keep in mind that unless you have unlimited text messaging service
on your cellphone, you can also be charged for receiving a text
message.
• Instant messages: You can opt to receive an IM on your own
account from AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), Yahoo! Messenger,
MSN Messenger, or Skype. You’re not charged for the IM service, so
if you have a Blackberry or a Sidekick and you don’t want to miss
any bidding action, this could be a great option for you. Also, with
the IM service, you can bid again from a link that comes along with
the Outbid alert.
• Phone alert: Three minutes before the end of the auction, you can
get a call direct to your cellphone. A recorded voice tells you
what you need to know without offering comments like, “how
could you consider buying that . . . ??”. There’s no charge, and the
call requires you to input a PIN to retrieve the information. In the
case of an outbid call, you’re given the option to up your bid right
over the phone.
109
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

 Seller Information box: This area gives you information about the seller.
Know thy seller ranks right after caveat emptor as a phrase that pays on
eBay. As I tell you nearly a million times in this book, read the feedback
rating! (Okay, maybe not a million — it would drive the editors bonkers.)
Human beings come in all shapes, sizes, and levels of honesty, and like
any community, eBay has its share of good folks and bad folks. Your best
defense is to read the seller’s feedback. You’ll see several things in the
Seller Information box (as shown in Figure 6-3):
• Feedback Rating: This is the number that’s next to the seller’s ID.
Click the number to view his or her eBay ID card and entire feed-
back history. Read, read, and reread all the feedback (hey, I’m one
feedback reference closer to a million!) to make sure you feel com-
fortable doing business with this person.
• Positive Feedback percentage: The eBay computers cipher this
figure. It’s derived from all the positive and negative feedback that
a user receives.
• Member Since: This line lists the date the seller registered on eBay
and the country in which he or she registered.
• Read Feedback Comments link: This link does the same thing as
clicking the Feedback Rating number.
• Ask Seller a Question link: Clicking this link hooks you up with
eBay’s e-mail system. You can ask the seller a question regarding
the item here.
Figure 6-3:
Lots of
data on the
seller here.
110
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

• View Seller’s Other Items link: This link takes you to a page that
lists all the seller’s current auctions and fixed-price sales.
If the seller has an eBay store, a link to it appears here as well. I
give you a step-by-step guide on how these links work later in this
chapter.
If the seller accepts PayPal, that option is indicated in a shaded
area. Also, if the seller qualifies for Buyer Protection, this is also
indicated here.
 Description bar: Below this light blue shaded bar is the item descrip-
tion. You must always read all the item description information carefully
before bidding. Read on to find out how to use this information.
On a typical auction item page, below the seller’s description area you find
some other important data, as shown in Figure 6-4:
 Shipping and Payment Details: Check here to see the details on ship-
ping. You see
• Who pays (remember that on eBay, it’s usually the buyer).
• Whether insurance is offered.
• Which states have to pay sales tax (if any).
• Whether the seller is willing to ship to your area. (Sometimes sell-
ers won’t ship internationally, and they’ll let you know here.)

111
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

Also, always check the item description for other shipping information
and terms.
If the item weighs more than a pound, the seller may have conveniently
included eBay’s shipping calculator in this area. Just type in your zip
code, and you’re presented with the shipping cost to your location.
 Payment Methods Accepted: This field tells you the payment methods
that the seller accepts: checks, money orders, credit cards, or PayPal.
Often, it tells you to read the item description for more details. I explain
how to read item descriptions later in this chapter.
Beating the Devil in the Details
As with any sale — whether you find it at Joe’s Hardware, Bloomingdale’s, or
Target — carefully check out what you’re buying. The item page gives you
links to help you know what you’re bidding on — and who you’re potentially
buying from. If you take advantage of these features, you won’t have many
problems. But, if you ignore these essential tips, you may end up unhappy
with what you buy, who you buy it from, and how much you spend.
Read the item description carefully
The item description is the most critical item on the auction item page. This is
where the seller lists the details about the item being sold. Read this page
carefully and pay very close attention to what is, and isn’t, written.
Don’t judge a book by its cover — but do judge a seller by his or her item
description. If the sentences are succinct, detailed, and well structured,
you’re most likely dealing with an individual who planned and executed the
auction with care. It takes time and effort to post a good auction. If you see
huge lapses in grammar, convoluted sentences, and misspellings, you may be
gonna get burnt! Make sure that you feel comfortable dealing with this person;
decide for yourself whether he or she is out to sell junk for a quick buck or is
part of eBay for the long term.
If a picture is available, take a good look. The majority of eBay sellers jazz up
their auctions with photos of their items. The seller should answer a few gen-
eral questions in the item description. If these questions aren’t answered,
that doesn’t necessarily mean that the seller’s disreputable — only that if
you’re really interested, you should e-mail the seller and get those answers
before you bid. In particular, ask questions like these:
112
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

 Is the item new or used?
 Is the item a first edition or a reprint? New or used? An original or a reis-
sue? (See Chapter 5 for tips on how to assess what you’re buying.)
 Is the item in its original packaging? Does it still have the original tags?
 Is the item under warranty?
Most sellers spell out in their item descriptions exactly how the item should
be paid for and shipped. Check the Shipping and Payment Details box under
the description to see whether an actual shipping charge applies — and if so,
how much it’ll cost you. Some sellers use eBay’s incredibly convenient ship-
ping calculator. Here are a few other things to consider regarding your item:
 If you’re in a hurry to get the item, are delays likely? If so, what sort and
how long?
 Can the seller guarantee you a refund if the item is broken or doesn’t
work upon delivery?
 What condition is the item in? Is it broken, scratched, flawed, or mint?
Most experienced eBay buyers know that, depending on the item, a tiny
scratch here or there may be worth the risk of making a bid. But a
scratch or two may affect your bidding price. (Look at Chapter 5 for
more expert advice for buying collectibles.)
 Is this item the genuine article or a reproduction, and if it’s the real deal,
does the seller have papers or labels certifying its authenticity?
 What size is the item, and how much does it weigh? (That life-size fiber-
glass whale may not fit in your garage. That baby grand piano might cost
a lot to ship from Peru, so you need to factor in the cost of shipping
when you consider how much you’re willing to bid.)
If you win the item and find out the seller lied in the description, you have the
right to request to return the item. But, if you win the item and discover that
you overlooked a detail in the description, the seller isn’t obligated to take
the item back.
The seller is obligated to describe the item honestly and in detail, so if your
questions aren’t answered in the item description, then for goodness’ sake,
e-mail the seller for the facts. If a picture is available, is it clear enough that
you can see any flaws? You can always ask the seller to e-mail you a picture
taken from another angle.
113
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

Get the scoop on the seller
I can’t tell you enough that the single most important way you can make an
auction go well is to know who you’re dealing with. Apparently, the eBay folks
agree; they enable you to get info on the seller right from the auction item
page. I recommend that you take advantage of the links offered there.
(Chapter 5 demonstrates how to conduct a thorough By Seller search.) To get
the full scoop on a seller, here’s what you need to do:
 Click the number beside the seller’s User ID to get his or her feedback
history. Click the Me link (if there is one) next to the seller to view the
seller’s About Me page. It frequently gives you a good deal more informa-
tion about the seller. (To set up your own free About Me page on eBay,
check out Chapter 14.)
 Make note if you see the PowerSeller icon next to the seller’s name. It
means he or she is an eBay seller who has met certain stringent certifi-
cations. (For more on PowerSellers, see Chapter 20.)
 Click the View Seller’s Other Auctions link to take a look at what else
that person is selling. (If you win more than one auction from a seller, he
or she will often combine the shipping costs.) Check the seller’s feed-
back (message sound familiar?).
Check the seller’s eBay ID card and feedback history. All together, now —
check the feedback. (Is there an echo in here?) What you will find are (for the
most part) the honest thoughts and comments of buyers from previous trans-
actions. No eBay user has control over the comments that others make, and
feedback sticks to you like your permanent record from high school.
Read the feedback — the good, the bad, and the neutral — and unless you’re
prepared to kiss your money goodbye, I’ve found it safer not to buy from a
seller who has a large percentage of negative comments.
eBay, like life, is full of shades of gray. Some sellers are unfairly hit with nega-
tive comments for something that wasn’t their fault. If you suspect that a
seller’s received a bum rap (after you’ve read all his or her positive feed-
back), be sure to read the seller’s response. (Look at Chapter 4 for more on
reading and leaving feedback.)
Although scoping out an eBay Member Profile is just that fast, just that simple,
you still need to take the time to read the feedback. (There’s that echo again.
Good thing it’s a wise echo.) Someone with 500 positive feedback messages
may look like a good seller, but if you take a closer look, you may find that his
or her ten most-recent feedback messages are negative.
114
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

View the seller’s other auctions
To find out what other auctions the seller has going at eBay, all you have to
do is click the corresponding link on the item page; you’re whisked away to a
list of the other auction pies the seller has a finger in. If the seller has no other
auctions going and has no current feedback, you may want to do a more thor-
ough investigation and conduct a By Seller search that will show you all that
person’s completed auctions in the last 30 days. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
Ask the seller a question
If anything about the auction is unclear to you, remember this one word: ask.
Find out all the details about that item before you bid. If you wait until you’ve
won the item before you ask questions, you may get stuck with something
you don’t want. Double-checking may save you woe and hassle later.
You can find out more about payment options, shipping charges, insurance,
and other fun stuff in Chapters 8 and 12.
If you’re bidding on a reserve-price auction, don’t be afraid to e-mail the
seller and ask what the reserve is. Yeah, reserves are mostly kept secret, but
there’s no harm in asking — and many sellers gladly tell you.
To ask a seller a question, follow these steps:
1. Click the Ask Seller a Question link on the item page.
You’re presented with the Ask the Seller a Question form.

How Swede it is!
A savvy eBay user I know benefited from a
major seller error. The seller titled his auction
“Swede Star Trek Cast Jacket.” My friend
checked out the item description and found that
it was written with bad spelling and incoherent
grammar, so she e-mailed the seller for more
information. The seller explained that the jacket
was a suede cast jacket given as a wrap gift to
the cast and crew of the movie Star Trek:
Generations. He had won it in a local radio con-
test, and it was brand new. Because of the
seller’s mistake, only one bidder bid on this
lovely green suede (silk-lined!) jacket, which my
friend picked up for $150. Because of its Star
Trek connection, the jacket is worth upwards of
$400 to collectors. So study the item page care-
fully. You may get lucky and find that errors can
work to your benefit. (And a word to the wise:
Check your own spelling and grammar carefully
when you put an item up for sale.)

You can always change your User ID, but your past life (in the form of
feedback messages) stays with you at eBay. Along with your feedback
from your previous User ID, all your previous User IDs are listed as well
in a User ID history search from the eBay Search page.
2. Fill in the message area and politely fire off your questions; then click
Send Message.
Expect to hear back from the seller within a day. If it takes the seller
more than a day or two to respond (unless it’s over the weekend — eBay
sellers are entitled to a little rest), and you get no explanation for the
delay, think twice before putting in a bid.
Factoring in the Extras
Before you think about placing a bid on an item, you should factor in the
financial obligation you have to make. In every case, the maximum bid you
place won’t be all you spend on an item. I recommend that you look closely
at the payment methods that the seller is willing to accept and also factor in
shipping, insurance, and escrow costs (if any). If you have only $50 to spend,
you shouldn’t place a $50 bid on a fragile item that will be shipped a long dis-
tance because often the buyer (that would be you) pays for shipping and
insurance. In addition, if you live in the same state as the seller, you may have
to pay sales tax if the seller is running an official business.
Payment methods
Several payment options are available, but the seller has the right to refuse
some forms of payment. Usually, the accepted forms of payment are laid out
in the item’s description or in the Shipping and Payment Details below the
description area. If you don’t see this info, ask the seller a question (as
described in the previous section) and get a clear idea of your additional
costs before you place a bid.
These are the forms of payment available to you:
 Credit card: Paying with a credit card is a favorite payment option for
many buyers, one that’s mainly offered by businesses and dealers. I like
paying with credit cards because they’re fast and efficient. In addition,
using a credit card offers you another ally, your credit card company, if
you’re not completely satisfied with the transaction.
Sometimes sellers use a friend’s company to run credit card payments
for eBay auctions. So don’t be surprised if you buy a vintage Tonka bull-
dozer and your credit card is billed from Holly’s Hair-o-Rama.
116
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

 PayPal: I pay for almost all my eBay purchases through PayPal. Owned
by eBay, PayPal is the largest Internet-wide payment network. Sellers
who accept PayPal are identified with a special icon in the Seller
Information box (as well as a large PayPal logo in the Payment Methods
area below the description) and accept American Express, Visa,
MasterCard, and Discover as well as electronic checks and debits. The
service is integrated directly into eBay auctions, so paying is a mouse
click away.
After you register with PayPal to pay for an item, PayPal debits your
credit card or your bank checking account (or your account — if you
have earned some money from sales) and sends the payment to the
seller’s account. PayPal does not charge buyers to use the service.
Buyers can use PayPal to pay any seller within the United States (and
around the world in over 55 countries). Some international bidders can
pay for their eBay auctions from sellers in the United States. To see a
current list of PayPal’s international services go to www.paypal.com/
cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/approved_countries-outside.
PayPal deposits the money directly into the seller’s checking or savings
account. The service charges the seller a small transaction fee, so the
seller absorbs the cost.
Your credit card information is known only to the PayPal service. The
seller never sees your credit card info. Another major advantage is that
you have protection behind you when you use PayPal. And you have the
right to dispute charges if the item arrives damaged or doesn’t show up
at all. When you use PayPal to pay for a qualified eBay item from a
Verified PayPal member, you may be covered by PayPal’s Buyer
Protection program for purchases up to $1,000. To find out whether your
item is protected in this program, look for the information at the bottom
of the Seller Information box (refer to Figure 6-3).
For more details, check out the PayPal Web site (www.paypal.com).
 Money order: My second-favorite method of payment — and the most
popular at eBay — is the money order. Sellers love money orders
because they don’t have to wait for a check to clear.
Money orders are the same as cash. As soon as the seller gets your
money order, he or she has no reason to wait to send the item. You can
buy money orders at banks, supermarkets, convenience stores, and your
local post office. The average cost is about a dollar. If you’re purchasing
an item that’s being shipped internationally, you can pay with an interna-
tional money order from the U.S. Postal Service, which costs about $3.00.
 Personal or cashier’s check: Paying by check is convenient but has its
drawbacks. Most sellers won’t ship you the goods until after your check
clears, which means a lag time of a couple of weeks or more. If a seller
takes personal checks, the item’s description usually states how long
the seller will wait for the check to clear before shipping the item.
117
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

Unfortunately, that means that while the seller is waiting for your check
to clear, your merchandise is collecting dust in a box somewhere. This is
no fun for you or for the seller. Cashier’s checks are available at your
bank but often cost much more than a money order. It’s not worth the
extra money — have fun and buy more eBay items instead.
Before you send a personal check, make sure that you have enough
money to cover your purchase. A bounced check can earn you negative
feedback — too many negative transactions will bounce you off eBay.
The good news about checks is that you can track whether or not
they’ve been cashed. Personal checks leave a paper trail that you can
follow if a problem occurs later on.
The bad news about checks is that you’re revealing personal informa-
tion, such as your bank account number, to a stranger.
 C.O.D.: No, I’m not talking about codfish. I’m talking about Cash on
Delivery. As a buyer, you may like the idea that you have to pay for an
item only if it shows up. But paying C.O.D. has two problems:
• You have to have the money on hand — the exact amount. When
was the last time any of us had exact change for anything?
• Even if you have exact change, if you’re not around when the
item’s delivered, you’re out of luck.
If you miss the C.O.D. delivery, the shipment heads back to Bolivia or
Oblivion or wherever it came from, never to be seen again. And what do you
get? A lot of angry e-mails and maybe some negative feedback. No wonder
sellers rarely use this option.
Most business at eBay is conducted in U.S. dollars. If you happen to buy an
item from an international seller, you may need to convert American dollars
into another currency. eBay has a currency converter, located at the follow-
ing URL:
pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/currencyconverter.html
Just select your choice of currency, type in the amount, and click Perform
Currency Conversion.
Never use a form of payment that doesn’t let you keep a paper trail. (Don’t
Wire Money, and never send cash in the mail!) If a seller asks for cash,
quote Nancy Reagan — just say no. Occasionally, I hear of international
buyers sending U.S. greenbacks in the mail. But, if a seller asks for cash,
chances are that you may never see the item or your money again. Oh, yeah,
here’s something else — if a seller asks you to send your payment to a post
office box, get a phone number. Many legitimate sellers use post office boxes,
but so do the bad guys.
118
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Using an escrow service
Even though most sales at eBay are for items that cost $100 or less, using an
escrow service comes in handy on occasion — like when you buy a big-ticket
item or something extremely rare. Escrow is a service that allows a buyer and
seller to protect a transaction by placing the money in the hands of a neutral
third party until a specified set of conditions are met. Sellers note in their
item descriptions if they’re willing to accept escrow. If you’re nervous about
sending a lot of money to someone you don’t really know (like a user named
Clumsy who has only two feedback comments and is shipping you bone
china from Broken Hill, Australia), consider using an escrow company.
Using an escrow company is worthwhile only if the item you’re bidding on is
expensive, rare, or fragile, or traveling a long distance. If you’re spending less
than $200 for the item, I recommend that you purchase insurance from your
shipper instead — just in case. Remember, with purchases under $200, you’re
also protected against fraud through eBay. (You may be protected up to $1,000
if you pay through PayPal — see the section “Payment methods” section, ear-
lier in this chapter.)
eBay has a partnership with Escrow.com to handle eBay auction escrow sales
in Canada and the United States. After an auction closes, the buyer sends the
payment to the escrow company. After the escrow company receives the
money, it e-mails the seller to ship the merchandise. After the buyer receives
the item, he or she has an agreed-on period of time to look it over. If every-
thing’s okay, the escrow service sends the payment to the seller. If the buyer
is unhappy with the item, he or she must ship it back to the seller. When the
escrow service receives word from the seller that the item has been returned,
the service returns the payment to the buyer (minus the escrow company’s
handling fee, of course).
Before you start an escrow transaction, make sure that you and the seller
agree on these terms (use e-mail to sort it out). Here are three questions about
escrow that you should know the answers to before you bid:
 Who pays the escrow fee? (Normally, the buyer does, though sometimes
the buyer and seller split the cost.)
 How long is the inspection period? (Routinely, it’s two business days
after receipt of the merchandise.)
 Who pays for return shipping if the item is rejected? (The buyer, usually.)
Shipping and insurance costs
Don’t let the sale go down with the shipping. Most auction descriptions end
with “buyer to pay shipping charges.” If the item is not an odd shape,
119
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

excessively large, or fragile, experienced sellers calculate the shipping based
on Priority Mail at the U.S. Postal Service, which is the unofficial eBay stan-
dard. Expect to pay a minimum of $4.05 for the first pound and another $0.50
for tracking the item.
It has also become somewhat routine for the seller to add a dollar or so for
packing materials like paper, bubble wrap, tape, and such. This is a fair and
reasonable handling charge because the cost of these items can add up
over time.
You may come across sellers trying to nickel-and-dime their way to a fortune
by jacking up the prices on shipping to ridiculous proportions. If you have a
question about shipping costs, ask before you bid on the item.
Before bidding on big stuff, like a barber’s chair or a sofa, check for some-
thing in the item description that says “Buyer Pays Actual Shipping Charges.”
When you see that, always e-mail the seller prior to your bid to find out what
those shipping charges would be to your home. On larger items, you may
need to factor in packing and crating charges. The seller may also suggest a
specific shipping company.
As the bumper sticker says, (ahem) stuff happens — sometimes to the stuff
you buy. But before you give up and just stuff it, consider insuring it. eBay
transactions sometimes involve two types of insurance that may have an
impact on your pocketbook:
 Shipping insurance: This insurance covers your item as it travels
through the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, or any of the other carriers.
Some savvy sellers have signed up with a company called Package In-
Transit Coverage (U-PIC). This company insures all the packages of its
clients using an annual policy. This way the seller doesn’t have to stand
in line at the post office to get an insurance stamp from a clerk. The seller
simply logs the packages and reports on them on a monthly basis. Sellers
will let you know that they use this service when they ship your item.
Although many sellers offer shipping insurance as an option, others
don’t bother because if the price of the item is low, they’d rather refund
your money and keep you happy than go through all that insurance
paperwork. Don’t forget that if you want shipping insurance, you pay for
it. (See Chapter 12 for details on shipping insurance.)
 Fraud protection: eBay provides some nominal protection against fraud,
eBay’s Standard Purchase Protection Program. eBay’s Purchase
Protection insurance pays up to $175 (a maximum of $200 minus a $25
deductible). So if you file a $50 claim, you get $25. If you file a $5,000
claim, you still only get $175. (All the details of this type of insurance are
covered in Chapter 16.) Remember if you pay via PayPal, you may be
covered for purchases up to $1,000.
120
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Placing Your Bid
Okay, so you’ve found the perfect item to track (say a really classy Elvis Presley
wristwatch), and it’s in your price range. You’re more than interested — you’re
ready to bid. If this were a live auction, some stodgy-looking guy in a gray suit
would see you nod your head and start the bidding at, say, $2. Then some
woman with a severe hairdo would yank on her ear, and the Elvis watch
would jump to $3.
eBay reality is more like this: You’re sitting at home in your fuzzy slippers,
sipping coffee in front of the computer; all the other bidders are cruising
cyberspace in their pajamas, too. You just can’t see ’em. (Be real thankful for
little favors.)
When you’re ready to jump into the eBay fray, you can find the bidding form
(shown in Figure 6-5) at the bottom of the auction item page (or click the
Place Bid button at the top of the auction page). When you get to the bottom
of the page, if the item includes a Buy It Now option, you see that next to the
bid form.
To fill out the bidding form and place a bid, first make sure that you’re regis-
tered (see Chapter 2 for details) and then follow these steps. After you make
your first bid on an item, you can instantly get to auctions you’re bidding on
from your My eBay page. (If you need some tips on how to set up My eBay,
see Chapter 4.)
1. Enter your maximum bid in the appropriate box.
The bid needs to be an increment or more higher than the current mini-
mum bid. The lowest amount you can bid is displayed to the right of the
bidding box. (See “Bidding to the Max: Proxy Bidding” for more informa-
tion about bidding increments.)
Figure 6-5:
You can find
the bidding
form at the

Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

2. If this is a Multiple Item auction, enter the quantity of items that
you’re bidding on.
(If it’s not a Multiple Item auction, the quantity is always 1.) Figure 6-6
shows a Multiple Item auction bidding form.
You don’t need to put in the dollar sign but do use a decimal point —
unless you really want to pay $1,049.00 instead of $10.49. If you make a
mistake with an incorrect decimal point, you can retract your bid (see
“Retracting your bid” later in this chapter).
3. Click Place Bid.
The Review Bid page appears on your screen, filled with a wealth of
legalese. This is your last chance to change your mind: Do you really
want the item, and can you really buy it? The bottom line is this: If you
bid on it and you win, you buy it. eBay really means it.
4. At this point, you have to sign in if you haven’t already. If you’re
signed in, skip to Step 5.
5. If you agree to the terms, click Submit.
After you agree, the Bid Confirmation screen appears.
When you first start out on eBay, I suggest that you start with a token bid — a
small bid that won’t win you the auction but that can help you keep tabs on
the auction’s progress.
After you bid on an item, the item number and title appear on your My eBay
page, listed under (big surprise) Bidding, as shown in Figure 6-7. (See Chapter
4 for more information on My eBay.) The Bidding list makes tracking your
auction (or auctions, if you’re bidding on multiple items) easy.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

eBay considers a bid on an item to be a binding contract. You can save your-
self a lot of heartache if you make a promise to yourself — never bid on an
item you don’t intend to buy — and keep to it. Don’t make practice bids, assum-
ing that because you’re new to eBay, you can’t win; if you do that, you’ll proba-
bly win simply because you’ve left yourself open to Murphy’s Law. Therefore,
before you go to the bidding form, be sure that you’re in this auction for the
long haul and make yourself another promise — figure out the maximum
you’re willing to spend — and stick to it. (Read the section “The Agony (?) of
Buyer’s Remorse,” later in this chapter, for doleful accounts of what can
happen if you bid idly or get buyer’s remorse.)
Bidding to the Max: Proxy Bidding
When you make a maximum bid on the bidding form, you actually make sev-
eral small bids — again and again — until the bidding reaches where you told
it to stop. For example, if the current bid is up to $19.99 and you put in a max-
imum of $45.02, your bid automatically increases incrementally so that you’re
ahead of the competition — at least until someone else’s maximum bid
exceeds yours. Basically, you bid by proxy, which means that your bid rises
incrementally in response to other bidders’ bids.
Figure 6-7:
Keep track
of items

bidding on
right from
your My
eBay page.
123
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

No one else knows for sure whether you’re bidding by proxy, and no one
knows how high your maximum bid is. And the best part is that you can be
out having a life of your own while the proxy bid happens automatically.
Buyers and sellers have no control over the increments (appropriately called
bid increments) that eBay sets. The bid increment is the amount of money by
which a bid is raised, and eBay’s system can work in mysterious ways. The
current maximum bid can jump up a nickel or a quarter or even an Andrew
Jackson, but there is a method to the madness, even though you may not
think so. eBay uses a bid-increment formula, which uses the current high bid
to determine how much to increase the bid increment. For example:
 A 5-quart bottle of cold cream has a current high bid of $14.95. The bid
increment is $0.50 — meaning that if you bid by proxy, your proxy will
bid $15.45.
 But a 5-ounce can of top-notch caviar has a high bid of $200. The bid incre-
ment is $2.50. If you choose to bid by proxy, your proxy will bid $202.50.
Table 6-1 shows you what kind of magic happens when you put the proxy
system and a bid-increment formula together in the same cyber-room.

the two of you go on with your lives. The bid increment inches from $0.25 to $0.50
as the current high bid increases.

Specialized Auction Categories
After you get the hang of bidding at eBay, you may venture to the specialized
auction areas. You can purchase fine art from eBay’s Live Auctions, a car or
car parts and accessories from eBay Motors, or your own piece of land or a
new home in the Real Estate category. eBay is always adding new specialty
areas, so be sure to check the announcements as well as the home page.
Should you reach the big-time bidding, be aware that if you bid over $15,000
in an auction, you must register a credit card with eBay. All items in the spe-
cial categories are searchable in eBay’s search engine, so don’t worry about
missing your dream Corvette when you use the Search page.
eBay Motors
Visiting the automotive area of eBay is an auto enthusiast’s dream. You can
also find some great deals in used cars, and eBay offers these creative ways
to make buying vehicles of all shapes and sizes (as well as the largest array of
parts you’ll find anywhere on the planet) easy for you. Visit eBay Motors, by
clicking the eBay Motors link on the home page or by going to www.ebay
motors.com.
 Search engine: If you want to search for cars without coming up with
hundreds of die-cast vehicles, eBay motors has its own search available
from the eBay Motors home page.
 Vehicle shipping: If you don’t want to drive across the country to pick
up your new vehicle, you can have it shipped through Dependable Auto
Shippers. Check online for a free quote.
125
Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

 Inspections: Many used-car sellers take advantage of inspection service
vendors. These companies offer a comprehensive inspection covering
the mechanical condition and cosmetic appearance and they supply a
detailed inspection report. Car auctions from sellers who have their cars
inspected have their auctions listed with an Inspection icon.
 Lemon Check: With the vehicle’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number),
you can run a lemon check right on the car through CARFAX.com.
 Escrow: Escrow.com is one of the safest ways to purchase a vehicle
online. Escrow.com verifies and secures the buyer’s payment and
releases payment to the seller only after the buyer inspects and is com-
pletely satisfied with the vehicle.
eBay Live Auctions
If I don’t check out eBay Live Auctions at least once a month, I feel like I’m
missing something. eBay Live Auctions is the very cool hub for auction
houses and dealers from around the world. Here you find items that are so
rare, you’ll never find ’em anywhere else. I just wasted (er, enriched) about
half an hour of my life looking over some wonderful things up for auction. I
saw autographs from Abraham Lincoln, illuminated manuscripts from the
1700s, and signed letters from Albert Schweitzer — how cool. I can’t afford
any of these items, but perusing eBay Live Auctions is like spending time in
the fine galleries of the world — it’s my version of virtual window-shopping!
Live Auctions allows you to participate in real-time auctions as they happen
at the finest auction houses around the world. You can get to eBay Live
Auctions through the eBay home page (it’s listed at the bottom of the
Categories list). Remember to read the terms carefully, because often you
must pay a bidder’s premium (an additional amount added to your bid of up
to 20 percent) on Live Auction items.
You may find yourself (or fantasize about) bidding against celebrities for amaz-
ing items — that, in itself, is a lot of fun! If you don’t have the money at the
moment to bid on Live Auction items, you can just click View Live, and your
computer gives you a real-time view of the auction. Take a look at Figure 6-8;
it’s an item I’d love to have, but just can’t afford!
If you think that there’s the slightest chance that you may want to bid on
something, be sure to register for the auction in advance to participate in an
eBay Live Auction. There’s nothing worse than not being registered and
seeing an item that you thought you couldn’t afford go on the block, observ-
ing very few bids, and watching it sell for a price within your range.
126
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Making purchases on the spot!
There’s more to eBay than auctions. Aside from the Buy It Now offer available
on some auctions, eBay holds venues for various items that you can buy
right now!
eBay Stores
The newly instituted eBay Stores are a quick, easy, and convenient way to
find items for sale that you can buy now. A large number of eBay sellers have
opened eBay Stores as an inexpensive way to display more items for sale.
They’re offered a much lower listing fee for their items, as low as 5 cents, and
the items stay in their stores for as long as they want. The lower listing fees
are quite a savings over the fees for listing an item for auction, and sellers
often pass the savings onto you.
When you’re perusing the auctions at eBay, look for the little red door icon
next to a seller’s User ID. If you click the door, you’re magically transported
to the seller’s virtual eBay storefront. Figure 6-9 shows you the eBay Stores
hub. You get there by clicking the eBay Stores link on the upper-left side of
the home page.

eBay Stores have a separate search engine than the eBay auction search
engine. If you don’t find the item you’re looking for at eBay auctions, look at
the column on the left side of the page. Under the Related Stores heading is a
list of eBay stores that may contain the item you’re looking for and a Search
Stores link. Click the link, and eBay performs the same search for you in all
eBay Stores.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 
Buyer’s remorse can pay off
Sometimes buyer’s remorse does pay off. I
know one eBay buyer who got a serious case of
remorse after winning an auction. She decided
to do the right thing and pay for the item even
though she didn’t want it. After receiving the
item, she turned around and sold it on eBay for
triple what she paid. If you really don’t want the
item, think like a seller — see whether you can
turn a horrible mistake into a profitable venture.
For more information on the benefits of selling,
take a look at Chapter 9.

The Agony (?) of Buyer’s Remorse
Maybe you’re used to going into a shopping mall and purchasing something
that you’re not sure you like. What’s the worst that could happen? You end
up back at the mall, receipt in hand, returning the item. Not so on eBay. Even
if you realize you already have a purple feather boa in your closet that’s just
like the one you won yesterday on eBay, deciding that you don’t want to go
through with a transaction is a big deal. Not only can it earn you some nasty
feedback, but it can also give you the reputation of a deadbeat.
It would be a shame to float around eBay with the equivalent of a scarlet D
(for deadbeat) above your User ID. Okay, eBay uses a kinder term — non-
paying bidder — but for many members, it boils down to the same thing. If
you win an auction and have to back out of your obligation as the winner —
even through no fault of your own — you need some info that can keep you in
good (well, okay, better) standing. Look no further; you’ve found it.
Retracting your bid
Remember, many states consider your bid a binding contract, just like any
other contract. You can’t retract your bid unless one of these three outstand-
ingly unusual circumstances applies:
 If your bid is clearly a typographical error (you submitted a bid for
$4,567 when you really meant $45.67), you may retract your bid. If this
occurs, you should reenter the correct bid amount immediately.
You won’t get any sympathy if you try to retract an $18.25 bid by saying
you meant to bid $15.25, so review your bid before you send it.
 You have tried to contact the seller to answer questions on the item, and
he or she doesn’t reply in a timely fashion.
 If the seller substantially changes the description of an item after you
place a bid (the description of the item changes from “can of tennis
balls” to “a tennis ball,” for example), you may retract your bid.
If you simply must retract a bid, try to do so long before the auction ends —
and have a good reason for your retraction. eBay users are understanding, up
to a point. If you have a good explanation, you should come out of the situa-
tion all right. So admit you’ve made a mistake.
If you’ve made an error, you must retract your bid prior to the last 12 hours
of the auction. At this point, a retraction removes all bids you have placed in
the auction. Mistakes or not, when you retract a bid that was placed within
the last 12 hours of the listing, only the most recent bid you made is
retracted — your bids placed prior to the last 12 hours are still active.

Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics

Here’s how to retract a bid while the auction’s still going on; you can go to
offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBidShow or:
1. Click the My eBay link on the main navigation bar.
2. Go to the All Buying area.
Click the Go Directly to All Buying.
3. Scroll down to Related Links (on the left-hand side of the page) and
click the More link.
On the resulting page, click the link to go to the Bid Retraction form.
4. Read the legalese and scroll down the page. Enter the item number of
the auction you’re retracting your bid from. Then open the drop-down
menu and select one of the three legitimate reasons for retracting
your bid.
5. Click the Retract Bid button.
You receive a confirmation of your bid retraction via e-mail. Keep a copy
of it until the auction is completed.
The seller may send you an e-mail to ask for a more lengthy explanation of
your retraction, especially if the item was a hot seller that received a lot of
bids. You may also get e-mails from other bidders. Keep your replies courte-
ous. After you retract one bid on an item, all your lower bids on that item are
also retracted (unless the retraction is done within the last 12 hours), and
your retraction goes into the bidding history — another good reason to have
a really good reason for the retraction. The number of bids you’ve retracted
also goes on your feedback rating scorecard.
Avoiding deadbeat (non-paying
bidder) status
Some bidders are more like kidders — they bid even though they have no
intention of buying a thing. But those folks don’t last long on eBay because of
all the negative feedback they get. In fact, when honest eBay members spot
these ne’er-do-wells, they often post the deadbeats’ User IDs on eBay’s mes-
sage boards. Some eBay members have created entire Web sites to warn
others about dealing with the deadbeats . . . ahem . . . non-paying bidders.
(Civilized but chilly, isn’t it?)
130
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Exceptions to the deadbeat (er, sorry, non-paying bidder) rule may include the
following human mishaps:
 A death in the family
 Computer failure
 A huge misunderstanding
If you have a good reason to call off your purchase, make sure that the seller
knows about it. The seller is the only one who can excuse you from the sale.
If you receive a non-paying bidder warning but you’ve paid for the item, eBay
requires proof of payment. That would include a copy of the check (front and
back) or money order, a copy of the payment confirmation from PayPal (or

Chapter 6: Shopping eBay: The Basics
After the auction: Side deals or personal offers?
If a bidder is outbid on an item that he or she
really wants or if the auction’s reserve price
isn’t met, the bidder may send an e-mail to the
seller and see whether the seller is willing to
make another deal. Maybe the seller has
another similar item or is willing to sell the item
directly rather than run a whole new auction.
You need to know that this could happen — but
eBay doesn’t sanction this outside activity.
If the seller has more than one of the item, or the
original auction winner doesn’t go through with
the deal, the seller can make a Second Chance
offer. This is a legal eBay-sanctioned second
chance for underbidders (unsuccessful bid-
ders) who participated in the auction. Second
Chance offers can also be made in reserve auc-
tions if the reserve price wasn’t met.
Any side deals other than Second Chance offers
are unprotected. My friend Jack collects auto-
graphed final scripts from hit television sitcoms.
So when the curtain fell on Seinfeld, he had to
have a script. Not surprisingly, he found one on
eBay with a final price tag that was way out of
his league. But he knew that by placing a bid,
someone else with a signed script to sell might
see his name and try to make a deal. And he
was right.
After the auction closed, he received an e-mail
from a guy who worked on the final show and
had a script signed by all the actors. He offered
it to Jack for $1,000 less than the final auction
price at eBay. Tempted as he was to take the
offer, Jack understood that eBay’s rules and
regulations wouldn’t help him out if the deal
turned sour. He was also aware that he wouldn’t
receive the benefit of feedback (which is the
pillar of the eBay community) or any eBay
Standard Purchase Protection insurance for the
transaction.
If you even think about making a side deal,
remember that not only does eBay strictly pro-
hibit this activity, but eBay can also suspend you
if you are reported for making a side deal. And
if you’re the victim of a side-deal scam, eBay’s
rules and regulations don’t offer you any pro-
tection. My advice? Watch out!

eBay has a message for non-paying bidders: The policy is three strikes and
you’re out. After the first complaint about a non-paying (deadbeat) bidder,
eBay gives the bad guy or gal a warning. After the third offense, the non-
paying bidder is suspended from eBay for good and becomes NARU (Not A
Registered User). Nobody’s tarred and feathered, but you probably won’t see
hide nor hair of that user again on eBay.

 Knowing your competition

 Placing a token bid
 Using canny strategies to win your auction
W
hen I travel the country teaching classes about eBay, I speak to so many
people who find an item at eBay, bid on it, and at the last minute — the
last hour or the last day — are outbid. Sad and dejected, they find losing often
cuts to the core and makes them feel like losers.
You’re not a loser when you lose an auction on eBay. You just may not know
the fine art of sneaky bidding (my way of saying educated bidding).
When the stakes are high and you really, really want the item, you have to
resort to a higher form of strategy. Sports teams study their rivals, and politi-
cal candidates scout out what the opposition is doing. Bidding in competition
against other bidders is just as serious an enterprise. Follow the tips in this
chapter and see if you can come up with a strong bidding strategy of your
own. (Feel free to e-mail me with any scathingly brilliant plans; I’m always
open to new theories.)
Get to Know the High Bidder
The User ID of the person the item would belong to if the auction ended right
now is listed on the auction item page (assuming someone has bid on the
item). Take a look at this name because you may see it again in auctions for
similar items. If the high bidder has lots of feedback, he or she may know the
ropes — and be back to fight if you up the ante.

You can use the Items By Bidder search option, shown in Figure 7-1 on the
eBay Search page, to find out the bidder’s recent auction experience. If you’re
bidding on an item, conducting a bidder search on the competition can be a
valuable asset: This way, you can size up your opponent’s bidding style.
To get the skinny on a bidder, here’s the move:
1. Type in the User ID of the bidder you want to search for.
2. If you want to see auctions that this user has bid on in the past, select
the Yes option button on the Include Completed Items line.
You should check completed auctions. They give you a sense of how often
and at what time of day the user participates in auctions. You can also see
whether the opposition tends to bid in odd cents or round figures.
Keep in mind that eBay has a 30-day limit on the auction information it
returns, so don’t expect to see results from a year ago. By clicking the
item number in your search results, you can see at what times your main
competition tends to bid — and then bid when you know those folks
won’t be looking.
3. Tell eBay whether you also want to see the person’s bid even if he or
she is not the high bidder.
Selecting Yes means that you want to see the bidder’s activity in every
auction, even if the person is not the current high bidder. Selecting No
limits the search to auctions where the bidder is the current top dog. I
think you should check all of the bidder’s auctions to see how aggres-
sively he or she bids on items. You can also get a pretty good handle on
how badly a bidder wants specific items — and how high that person
will bid before dropping out.

134
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

If the bidder was bidding on the same item in the past that you’re both
interested in now, you can also get a fairly good idea of how high that
person is willing to go for the item.
4. Choose the number of items you want to see per page.
5. Click Search.
You may be tempted to try to contact a bidder you’re competing with so you
can get information about the person more easily. This is not only bad form
but could also get you suspended. Don’t do it.
Find Out an Item’s Bidding History
The bidding history, shown on the auction item page, lists everybody who is
bidding on an item. You can see how often and at what time bids are placed,
but you can’t see how much each bidder bids until the auction ends. Look at
Figure 7-2 to see a typical bidding history list. You can see bid amounts
because this auction has ended.
Pay attention to the times at which bidders are placing their bids; you may
find that, like many eBay users, the people bidding in this auction seem to be
creatures of habit — making their bids about once a day and at a particular
time of day. They may be logging on before work, during lunch, or after work.
Whatever their schedules, you have great info at your disposal in the event
that a bidding war breaks out: Just bid after your competition traditionally
logs out, and you increase your odds of winning the auction.
Early in an auction, there may not be much of a bidding history for an item,
but that doesn’t mean you can’t still check out the dates and times a bidder
places bids. You can also tell that a bidder practices sniping (discussed later
135
Chapter 7: Power-Bidding Strategies
The tale of the 3-plus-negative seller
A friend of mine took a risk and bid on an old
Winchester rifle (now a banned item — see
Chapter 9 for a rundown of what you’re allowed
and not allowed to sell at eBay) without reading
the seller’s feedback. The seller had a (+3) next
to his User ID, which is a somewhat okay rating.
Good thing my friend lost the auction. It turned
out that the seller had a whopping 20 negative
feedback messages. He had 23 positives, mostly
posted by suspicious-looking names. Repeat
after me: Always read the feedback comments!

in this chapter) if his or her bid zips in during the last few minutes (or even
seconds!) of the auction. You may have a fight on your hands if the bidder
does practice sniping.
Strategies to Help You Outsmart 
the Competition
Your 2 cents do matter — at least at eBay. Here’s why: Many eBay members
tend to round off their bids to the nearest dollar figure. Some choose nice,
familiar coin increments like 25, 50, or 75 cents. But the most successful eBay
bidders have found that adding two or three cents to a routine bid can mean
the difference between winning and losing. So I recommend that you make
your bids in oddish figures (such as $15.02 or $45.57) as an inexpensive way
to edge out your competition. If you have a proxy bid in, say for $22.57, and a
sniper jumps in at the last second and places a bid for $22.50 — you still win!
The highest bid placed always wins. For the first time ever, your two cents
(or in this case seven cents) may actually pay off!
That’s just one of the many strategies to get you ahead of the rest of the bid-
ding pack without paying more than you should. Note: The strategies in this
section are for bidders who are tracking an item over the course of a week or
so, so be sure you have time to track the item and plan your next moves.
Also, get a few auctions under your belt before you throw yourself into the
middle of a bidding war.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Multiple Item (Dutch) auction strategy
Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions (explained in Chapter 1) are funky. Yes, that’s a
technical term that means that a Multiple Item auction strategy is a little . . .
um . . . different. After all, each winner pays the same amount for the item,
and Multiple Item auctions don’t have a super-secret reserve price.
But winning a Multiple Item auction isn’t all that different from winning other
auctions. Therefore, wait until the closing minutes of the auction to bid and
then follow my sage advice for optimum success.
Here are the key things to remember about a Multiple Item auction:
 The seller must sell all the items at the lowest winning price at the
end of the auction, no matter what.
 Winners are based on the highest bids received. If you up the ante,
you could win the auction and pay only the lowest winning price, which
may be lower than your bid.
Confused yet? Say the minimum bid for each of ten Groundhog Day
watches is $10, and 20 people bid at $10, each person bidding for one
watch. The first ten bidders win the watch. But suppose you come along
at the end of the auction and bid $15 as the 21st bidder. You get a watch
(as do the first nine people who bid $10), and you get the watch for the
lowest successful bid — which is $10! Get it?
137
Chapter 7: Power-Bidding Strategies
Pirates of the Caribbean . . . or Carribean?
Just before the movie Pirates of the Caribbean
premiered, Disneyland gave out exclusive
movie posters to its visitors. My college student
daughter, savvy eBayer that she is, snagged
several copies to sell on the site. She listed
them (one at a time) when the movie opened
and couldn’t get more than the starting bid of
$9.99 for each of them.
When we searched eBay for pirates poster, we
found that the very same posters listed with a
misspelled title, “Pirates of the Carribean,”
were selling for as high as $30 each. After sell-
ing out her initial stock, my daughter found
another seller who had ten for sale — in one
auction — with the proper spelling. She bought
those as well (for $5.00 each) and sold them
with misspelled titles on the site for between
$15 and $27!
The moral of this story is always to search alter-
nate spellings of your item; you might possibly
eke out a gem without any competition.

 Know where you stand in the pecking order. You can see a list of high
bidders (and their bids) on the auction page, so you always know where
you stand in the pecking order. Keep checking back during the progress
of the auction so that you can adjust your bid appropriately.
 Avoid being the lowest or the highest high bidder. The highest bidder
is sure to win, so the usual bidding strategy is to knock out the lowest
high bidder. The lowest high bidder is said to be on the bubble and on
the verge of losing the auction by a couple of pennies. To avoid being
the bidder on the bubble, keep your bid just above the second-lowest
winning bid.
 If you want to buy more than one of an item up for auction, make sure
you have that number of successful high bids as the auction draws to
a close. Huh? Remember, winners are based on the highest bids. If you’re
in a Multiple Item auction for ten items and place five $15 bids, nothing
guarantees that you’ll win five of the item. Nine other people who want
the item could bid $20 apiece. Then they each win one of the items at
$15, and you end up with only one of the item. (At least you still pay only
$15 for it.) If you bid on all ten, your bid amount becomes the “lowest
successful bid amount,” and that’s how much you will pay for all ten.
Bidding strategies eBay doesn’t talk about
Here’s a list of dos and don’ts that can help you win your item. Of course,
some of these tips are eBay-endorsed, but I had to get you to notice what I
had to say somehow.
 Don’t bid early and high. Bidding early and high shows that you have a
clear interest in the item. It also shows that you’re a rookie, apt to make
mistakes. If you bid early and high, you may give away just how much
you want the item.
Of course, a higher bid does mean more bucks for the seller and a
healthy cut for the middleman. So it’s no big mystery that many sellers
recommend it. In fact, when you sell an item, you may want to encour-
age it too.
If you must bid early and can’t follow the auction action (you mean you
have a life?), use software or an online sniping service. Then feel free to
place your highest possible bid! You can find out more about that in
Chapter 20.
 Do wait and watch your auction. If you’re interested in an item and you
have the time to watch it from beginning to end, I say that the best strat-
egy is to wait. Mark the auction to Watch This Item on your My eBay
page and remember to check it daily. But if you don’t have the time, then
go ahead — put in your maximum bid early and cross your fingers.
138
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

 Don’t freak out if you find yourself in a bidding war. Don’t keel over if,
at the split second you’re convinced that you’re the high bidder with
your $45.02, someone beats you out at $45.50.
You can increase your maximum bid to $46.02, but if your bidding foe
also has a maximum of $46.02, the tie goes to the person who put in the
highest bid first. Bid as high as you’re willing to go, but bid at the very
end of the auction.
 Do check the item’s bidding history. If you find yourself in a bidding
war and want an item badly enough, check the bidding history and iden-
tify your fiercest competitor; then refer to the earlier section “Get to
Know the High Bidder” for a pre-auction briefing.
To get a pretty exact picture of your opponent’s bidding habits, make
special note of the times of day when he or she has bid on other auc-
tions. You can adjust your bidding times accordingly.
 Do remember that most deals go through without a problem. The
overwhelming majority of deals at eBay are closed with no trouble,
which means that if the auction you’re bidding in is typical and you
come in second place, you’ve lost. Or maybe not . . .
If the winning bidder backs out of the auction or the seller has more
than one of the item, the seller could (but isn’t obligated to) come to
another bidder and offer to sell the item at the second bidder’s price
through eBay’s Second Chance option. (See Chapter 13 for more details
on this feature.)
Time Is Money: Strategy by the Clock
You can use different bidding strategies depending on how much time is left
in an auction. By paying attention to the clock, you can learn about your com-
petition, beat them out, and end up paying less for your item.
Most auctions at eBay run for a week; the auction item page always lists how
much time is left. However, sellers can run auctions for as short as 1 day or
as long as 10 days. So synchronize your computer clock with eBay’s master
time and become the most precise eBay bidder around. Figure 7-3 shows
eBay’s Official Time page.
To synchronize your clock, make sure that you’re logged on to the Internet
and can easily access the eBay Web site. Then follow these steps:
1. Go into your computer’s Control Panel and double-click the icon that
represents your system’s date and time functions.
2. On the eBay Web site, go to the Site Map by clicking its link above the
navigation bar on the top of every eBay page.
139
Chapter 7: Power-Bidding Strategies

3. Click the eBay Official Time link.
This link is located at the bottom of the Browse column on the left side
of the page.
4. Check your computer’s time against eBay’s current time.
5. Click the minutes in your computer’s clock and then click the Reload
button (sometimes it’s called Refresh) on your browser.
Clicking Reload ensures that you see the latest, correct time from eBay.
6. Type in the minutes displayed on the eBay Official Time page as soon
as the newly reloaded page appears.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 to synchronize your computer’s seconds display
with eBay’s.
This process takes a little practice, but it can mean the difference between
winning and losing an auction.
You don’t need to worry about the hour display unless you don’t mind your
system clock displaying Pacific Time.
Most bidding at eBay goes on during East Coast work time and early evening
hours, which gives you a leg up if you live out West. Night-owl bidders will
find that after 10 p.m. Pacific Time (about 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time), lots of bar-
gains are to be had. And believe it or not, lots of auctions end in the wee
hours of the morning. Monday holidays are also great for bargains, as are

Thanksgiving and the day after. While everyone is in the living room digesting
and arguing about what to watch on TV (or getting up at 5:00 a.m. to buy the

gains you can win.
For simplicity’s sake, go over to my Web site and print out my quick and easy
eBay time-conversion chart. It’s located at
www.coolebaytools.com/usa_time_zones.html
Using the lounging-around strategy
Sometimes the best strategy at the beginning of an auction is to do nothing at
all. That’s right; relax, take off your shoes, and loaf. Go ahead. You may want
to make a token bid (the very lowest you are allowed) or mark the page to
watch in your My eBay area. I generally take this attitude through the first six
days of a week-long auction I want to bid on, and it works pretty well. Of
course, I check in every day just to keep tabs on the items I’m watching in my
My eBay page, and revise my strategy as time goes by.
The seller has the right to up his minimum bid — if his auction has received
no bids — up to 12 hours before the auction ends. If the seller has set a
ridiculously low minimum bid and then sees that the auction is getting no
action, the seller may choose to up the minimum bid to protect his invest-
ment in the item that’s up for sale. By placing the minimum token bid when
you first see the auction, you can foil a Buy It Now from another bidder
(because Buy It Now is disabled after a bid has been placed) or prevent the
seller from upping the minimum. If it’s important enough, you can see
whether the seller has done this in the past, by searching the Seller’s com-
pleted auctions (see “Get to Know the High Bidder” earlier in this chapter to
find out how to do this search). All preclosing changes are available for
public view; just click Revised next to the word Description on the item page.
See Figure 7-4 for a sample.
Figure 7-4:
This page
shows the

made by the

141
Chapter 7: Power-Bidding Strategies

If you see an item that you absolutely must have, mark it to watch on your My
eBay page (or make that token bid) and plan and revise your maximum bid as
the auction goes on. I can’t stress enough how important this is.
As you check back each day, take a look at the other bids and the high
bidder. Is someone starting a bidding war? Look at the time that the competi-
tion is bidding and note patterns. Maybe at noon Eastern Time? During
lunch? If you know what time your major competition is bidding, then —
when the time is right — you can safely bid after he or she does (preferably
when your foe is stuck in rush-hour traffic).
If you play the waiting game, you can decide if you really want to increase
your bid or wait around for the item to show up again sometime. You may
decide you really don’t want this particular item after all. Or you may feel no
rush because many sellers who offer multiple items put them up one at a
time.
Using the beat-the-clock strategy
You should rev up your bidding strategy during the final 24 hours of an auc-
tion and decide, once and for all, whether you really have to have the item
you’ve been eyeing. Maybe you put in a maximum bid of $45.02 earlier in the
week. Now’s the time to decide whether you’re willing to go as high as $50.02.
Maybe $56.03?
No one wants to spend the day in front of the computer (ask almost anyone
who does). You can camp out by the refrigerator or at your desk or wherever
you want to be. Just place a sticky note where you’re likely to see it, remind-
ing you of the exact time the auction ends. If you’re not going to be near a
computer when the auction closes, you can also use an automatic bidding
site to bid for you; see Chapter 20 for details.
In the last half hour
With a half hour left before the auction becomes ancient history, head for the
computer and dig in for the last battle of the bidding war. I recommend that
you log on to eBay about 5 to 10 minutes before the auction ends. The last
thing you want to have happen is to get caught in Internet gridlock and not
get access to the Web site. Go to the item you’re watching and click the auc-
tion title.
With 10 minutes to go, if there’s a lot of action on your auction, click Reload
or Refresh every 30 seconds to get the most current info on how many
people are bidding.
142
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Sniping to the finish: The final minutes
The rapid-fire, final flurry of bidding is called sniping. Sniping is the fine art of
waiting until the very last seconds of an eBay auction and then outbidding
the current high bidder just in time. Of course, you’ve got to expect that the
current high bidder is probably sniping back.
With a hot item, open a second window on your browser (in Internet Explorer
or Foxfire, you do that by pressing the Ctrl key and the N key together); keep
one open for bidding and the other open for constant reloading during the final
few minutes. With the countdown at 60 seconds or less, make your final bid at
the absolute highest amount you will pay for the item. The longer you can hold
off — I’m talking down to around 20 seconds — the better. It all depends on the
speed of your Internet connection (and how strong your stomach is), so prac-
tice on some small auctions so you know how much time to allow when you’re
bidding on your prize item. Keep reloading or refreshing your browser as fast
as you can, and watch the time tick to the end of the auction.
If you want to be truly fancy, you can open a third window (see Figure 7-5) and
have a back-up high bid in case you catch another sniper swooping in on your
item immediately after your first snipe. (I recently received an e-mail from one of
my readers who used my somewhat paranoid method — which she learned
from a previous edition of this book — and by using the second snipe, she won
her item!) You can avoid the third-window routine if you’ve bid your highest bid
with the first snipe. Then, if you’re outbid, you know the item went for more
than you were willing to pay. (I know; it’s some consolation, but not much.)
Some eBay members consider the practice of sniping highly unseemly and
uncivilized — it’s like when dozens of parents used to mob the department
store clerks to get to the handful of Cabbage Patch dolls that were just deliv-
ered. (Come to think of it, whatever happened to those collectibles?) Of
course, sometimes a little uncivilized behavior can be a hoot.

Chapter 7: Power-Bidding Strategies
The story of the Snipe sisters
Cory and Bonnie are sisters and avid eBay
buyers. Bonnie collects vases. She had her eye
on a Fenton Dragon Flies Ruby Verdena vase,
but the auction closed while she was at work
and didn’t have access to a computer. Knowing
that, her sister Cory decided to snipe for it. With
37 seconds to go, she inserted the high bid on
behalf of her sister. Bang, she was high bidder
at $63. But, with 17 seconds left, another bidder
sniped back and raised the price to $73. It was,
of course, Bonnie, who had found a way to get
access to a computer from where she was.
Bonnie got the vase, and they both had a good
laugh.

I say that sniping is an addictive, fun part of life at eBay auctions. And it’s a
blast. So my recommendation is that you try sniping. You’re likely to benefit
from the results and enjoy your eBay experience even more — especially if
you’re an adrenaline junkie.
Here’s a list of things to keep in mind when you get ready to place your last bid:
 Know how high you’re willing to go.
If you know you’re facing a lot of competition, figure out your highest
bid to the penny. You should have already researched the item and know
its value at this point. Raise your bid only to the level where you’re sure
you’re getting a good return on your investment; don’t go overboard.
Certainly, if the item has some emotional value to you and you just have
to have it, bid as high as you want (and can afford — but you knew that).
But remember, you’ll have to pay the piper later. You win it, you own it!
 Know how fast (or slow) your Internet connection is.
 Remember, this is a game, and sometimes it’s a game of chance, so don’t
lose heart if you lose the auction.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Although sellers love sniping because it drives up prices and bidders love it
because it’s fun, a sniper can ruin a week’s careful work on an auction strat-
egy. The most skillful snipers sneak in a bid so close to the end of the auction
that you have no chance to counter-bid, which means you lose. Losing too
often, especially to the same sniper, can be a drag.
If your Internet connection is slower than most, and you want to do some
sniping, make your final bid two minutes before the auction ends — and adjust
the amount of the bid as high as you feel comfortable so you can beat out the
competition.
If you can make the highest bid with less than 20 seconds left, you most likely
will win. With so many bids coming in the final seconds, your bid might be
the last one eBay records.
This stuff is supposed to be fun, so don’t lose perspective. If you can’t afford
an item, don’t get caught up in a bidding war. Otherwise, the only person who
wins is the seller. If you’re losing sleep, barking at your cat, or biting your
nails over any item, it’s time to rethink what you’re doing. Shopping at eBay
is like being in a long line in a busy department store. If it’s taking too much
of your life or an item costs too much, be willing to walk away — or log off —
and live to bid (or shop) another day.

 Ironing out the details and sending your payment
 Dealing with an AWOL seller
 Finishing the transaction with feedback
T
he thrill of the chase is over, and you’ve won your first eBay item.
Congratulations — now what do you do? You have to follow up on your
victory and keep a sharp eye on what you’re doing. The post-auction process
can be loaded with pitfalls and potential headaches if you don’t watch out.
Remember, sometimes money, like a full moon, does strange things to people.
In this chapter, you can get a handle on what’s in store for you after you win
the auction. I clue you in on what the seller’s supposed to do to make the
transaction go smoothly and show you how to grab hold of your responsibili-
ties as a buyer. I give you info here about following proper post-auction eti-
quette, including the best way to get organized, communicate with the seller
professionally, and send your payment without hazards. I also brief you on
how to handle an imperfect transaction.
eBay Calling: You’re a Winner
The All Buying section of your My eBay page highlights the titles of auctions
you’ve won and indicates the amount of your winning bid. If you think you may
have won the auction and don’t want to wait around for eBay to contact you,
check out the All Buying section for yourself and find out — are you a winner?
Throughout the bidding process, dollar amounts of items that you’re winning
appear in green on your My eBay page. If you’ve been outbid, they appear in
red. After the auction ends, there’s no marching band, no visit from Ed McMahon
and his camera crew, no armful of roses, and no oversized check to duck
behind. In fact, you’re more likely to find out that you’ve won the auction

from either the seller or the Bidding section of your My eBay page than 
you are to hear it right away from eBay. eBay tries to get its End of Auction
e-mails (EOAs) out pronto, but sometimes there’s a bit of lag time. For a look
at all the contact information in the End of Auction e-mail, see Figure 8-1.
If you can receive text messages on your cellphone, eBay will send EOA
notices to your mobile. (See Chapter 6 for more information on the types of
eBay alerts available.) Go to your My eBay: My Account: Preferences page and
click the Show link (the link appears next to Notification Delivery). You can
indicate just how you wish to receive the various notifications from eBay here.
Getting Your Paperwork Together
Yeah, I know that PCs were supposed to create a paperless society, but cars
were supposed to fly by the year 2000, too. Maybe it’s just as well that some
predictions don’t come true (think of the way some people drive). Paper still
has its uses; printing out hard copies of your auction records can help you
keep your transactions straight.
Your auction page shows the amount of your winning bid, the item’s descrip-
tion, and other relevant information. The second you find out you’ve won the
auction, click the Printer Version link in the upper right-hand corner of the
listing print out two copies of the item page if you’re mailing the payment to
the seller. Keep a copy for your files. Send the second copy to the seller along
with your payment; doing so is not only efficient but also polite.

Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

eBay displays auctions for only 30 days in the Bidder search, so don’t put off
printing out that final auction page for your records. If you save your End of
Auction e-mails that you get from eBay, you can access the auction for up to
90 days if you use the link in the e-mail.
Many sellers have multiple auctions going at the same time, so the more orga-
nized you are, the more likely you will receive the correct item (and positive
feedback) from the seller. Here’s a list of the items you should keep in your
auction purchases file:
 A copy of your EOA e-mail from eBay. Don’t delete the EOA e-mail — at
least not until you print a copy and keep it for your records. You may need
to refer to the EOA e-mail later, and there’s no way to get another copy.
 Printed copies of any e-mail correspondence between you and the seller
that details specific information about the item or special payment and
shipping arrangements.
 A printed copy of the final auction page.
Sellers can edit and update their auctions even while they’re in progress, so
keep your eyes peeled for changes in the auction as you monitor it. If the
seller makes major changes in the auction, you are within your rights to with-
draw your bid. (Check out Chapter 6 for more on the bidding process.)
Getting Contact Information
The eBay rules and regulations say that buyers and sellers must contact each
other within three business days of the auction’s end. So, if an item closes on
a Saturday, you need to make contact by Wednesday.
149
Chapter 8: After You Win the Item
An order of fries with a menu on the side
In 1999, one seller auctioned off an old menu
from Howard Johnson’s, estimating its era as
the 1950s based on the cars pictured on the
cover — and the prices (fried clams were
$1.25). Also included was a separate menu card
that listed fresh seafood and had a liquor menu
(with Pieman logo) on the back — plus a list of
locations in the New York City area. Except for a
couple of staple holes at the top of the front
cover (maybe evidence of daily specials past),
the menu was in very good condition. The start-
ing bid was $5; the item sold for $64. These
menus are even harder to come by now, but are
selling in the $45 range.
(I wonder how much they want for fried clams in
New York City these days. . . . )

If you’ve won an item and intend to pay through PayPal, it’s de rigueur for
you to go to the item as soon as possible after you’ve won and to use the Pay
Now link on the item page.
So, What’s Your Number?
If you don’t hear from the seller after three business days and you’ve already
tried sending an e-mail, you need to get more contact information. Remember
back when you registered and eBay asked for a phone number? eBay keeps
this information for times like this.
You may need to contact an eBay member by phone before you pay for your
item. To get an eBay member’s phone number, click the Advanced Search link
below the Search box and then click the Members: Find Contact Information
link on the left side of the screen. You need to enter the seller’s User ID and
the number of the item that you’re trading with the other member; then click
the Submit button.
eBay automatically generates an e-mail to both you and the other user.
eBay’s e-mail includes the seller’s User ID, name, e-mail address, company,
city, state, and country of residence, as well as the seller’s phone number and
date of initial registration. eBay sends this same information about you to the
user you want to get in touch with.
Often, sellers jump to attention when they receive this e-mail from eBay and
get the ball rolling to complete the transaction.
eBay doesn’t tolerate any abuses of its contact system. Make sure that you
use this resource only to communicate with another user about a specific
transaction. To use contact information to complete a deal outside of eBay is
an infringement of the rules. If you abuse the contact system, eBay can inves-
tigate you and kick you off the site.
If the seller doesn’t contact you within three business days, you may have to
do some nudging to complete the transaction. (See “Keeping in Touch: Dealing
with an AWOL Seller,” later in this chapter, and take a look at Chapter 13.)
Checking Out
When you buy something in a store, you need to check out to pay. eBay isn’t
much different. eBay’s Checkout is a very convenient way to pay for your
completed auctions, fixed-price sales, and Buy it Now sales with a credit card
or eCheck through PayPal. You may also use Checkout to exchange your
150
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

information with the seller and pay for your item at a place other than PayPal
(such as by money order, check, or another payment service that the seller
accepts).
Checkout is integrated directly onto the item page so that you can win and pay
for an item in less than a minute. Some sellers indicate, in their description,
that they will send you a link to their private checkout page. When the sale is
over, the item page will have checkout information, as shown in Figure 8-2.
When you click the Pay Now button, you’re taken step-by-step through the
checkout process. You pay for the item, and the seller is notified. You also get
an e-mail confirming your payment, along with the seller’s e-mail address.
You can make an immediate payment only if the seller chooses to accept
PayPal. If the seller chooses to accept other forms of payment, such as per-
sonal checks or money orders, you can still go through the process to send
the seller your shipping information (but not your actual payment). If the
shipping cost is based on your zip code, the seller can also use this informa-
tion to send you an invoice or to update the checkout information on the
item page. When that’s done, you can go ahead and send payment.
Communicating with the Seller
Top-notch sellers know that communication is the absolute key to a success-
ful transaction, and they do everything they can to set a positive tone for the
Figure 8-2:
Click the
Pay Now
button to
pay for the
item through
PayPal or to
indicate your

preferences.
151
Chapter 8: After You Win the Item

entire process with speedy and courteous e-mails (or, at the very least,
invoices).
Contact from a professional eBay seller should include the following information:
 Confirmation of the winning price
 The address for sending payment or a phone number for credit card 
processing
 A review of the shipping options and price (the fee you pay)
 Confirmation of escrow (if offered in the auction)
 The date the item will be shipped
When you read the seller’s e-mail, be sure to compare the terms the seller laid
out in his or her e-mail with the terms laid out on the auction page. And make
sure that the form of payment and where it should be sent are clear to you.
You should pay immediately upon receipt of the invoice. If you have a ques-
tion prior to payment, contact the seller immediately. He or she will be
expecting your payment.
The e-mail you receive from the seller after the auction is over should be a
confirmation of the options laid out on the auction item page. If you see sig-
nificant differences between what the seller’s saying now and what is on your
printout of the auction item page, address them immediately with the seller
before you proceed with the transaction. For more on clarifying payment
options during the bidding process, see Chapter 6.
Sending the Payment Promptly 
and Securely
So how many times have you heard the saying “The check is in the mail”?
Yeah, I’ve heard it about a thousand times, too. If you’re on the selling end of
a transaction, hearing this line from the buyer but not getting the money is
frustrating. If you’re on the buying end, it’s very bad form and may also lead
to bad feedback for you.
Being the good buyer that you are (you’re here finding out how to do the
right thing, right?), naturally you’ll get your payment out pronto. If you’ve
purchased an item and intend to pay via PayPal, do it immediately — why
wait? (The sooner you pay, the sooner you get that charming Flying Monkey
decanter you won!)
152
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

Most sellers expect to get paid within seven business days after the close of
the auction. Although this timeline isn’t mandatory, it makes good sense to
let the seller know payment is on the way.
Send your payment promptly. If you have to delay payment for any reason
(you have to go out of town, you ran out of checks, you broke your leg), let
the seller know as soon as possible. Most sellers understand if you send
them a kind and honest e-mail. Let the seller know what’s up, give him or her
a date by which the money can be expected, and then meet that deadline. If
the wait is unreasonably long, the seller may cancel the transaction. In that
case, you can expect to get some bad feedback.
Here are some tips on how to make sure that your payment reaches the seller
promptly and safely:
 Have your name and address printed on your checks. A check without a
printed name or address sends up a big red flag to sellers that the check
may not clear. For privacy and safety reasons, though, never put your
driver’s license number or Social Security number on your check.
 Always write the item title and your User ID on a check or money order and
enclose a printout of the final auction page in the envelope. The Number 1
pet peeve of most eBay sellers is that they get a payment but don’t know
what it’s for — that buyers send checks without any auction information.
 If you’re paying with a credit card without using a payment service and
you want to give the seller the number over the telephone, be sure to
request the seller’s phone number in your reply to the seller’s initial
e-mail and explain why you want it.
 You can safely e-mail your credit card information over the course of
several e-mails, each containing four numbers from your credit card.
Stagger your e-mails so that they’re about 20 minutes apart and don’t
forget to let the seller know what kind of credit card you’re using. Also,
give the card’s expiration date.
Buyers routinely send out payments without their name, their address, or a clue
as to what they’ve purchased. No matter how you pay, be sure to include a copy
of the eBay confirmation letter, a printout of the auction page, or a copy of the
e-mail the seller sent you. If you pay with a credit card via e-mail or over the
phone, you should still send this info through the mail just to be on the safe side.
Using PayPal, a person-to-person 
payment service
Chapter 6 covers the pros and cons of using PayPal to pay for your auctions.
Here’s where I show you why PayPal is the safest way to pay on eBay. eBay
153
Chapter 8: After You Win the Item

sees to it that PayPal is incredibly easy to use because PayPal is the official
payment service at eBay. After the auction is over, a link to pay appears. If
you’d prefer, wait until you hear from the seller. (I always like to have the
seller’s full name and address for my records before I send payment — 
especially if the amount of the transaction exceeds eBay’s Standard Purchase
Protection Program limit.)
You can make your payment in three different ways.
 Credit Card: You can use your American Express, Discover, Visa, or
MasterCard to make your payment through PayPal. The cost of the item
is charged to your card, and your statement will reflect a PayPal pay-
ment with the seller’s ID.
 eCheck: Sending money with an eCheck is easy. It debits your checking
account just like a paper check. It does not clear immediately, and the
seller probably won’t ship until PayPal tells him or her it has cleared
your bank.
 Instant Transfer: An Instant Transfer is just like an eCheck, except that it
clears immediately, and the money is directly posted to the seller’s account.
To send an Instant Transfer, you must have a credit card on file with PayPal
as a backup (should the payment from your bank be denied).
PayPal is my favorite payment service for another reason. PayPal has a buyer
protection program, which will cover your purchases, over and above the
$200 supplied by eBay’s Standard Purchase Protection Program. Read more
about that in Chapter 16.
When the auction is over, you can click the Pay Now button to check out and
enter the PayPal site. If you don’t pay immediately from the item page or
seller’s invoice, click the Pay link above the eBay navigation bar or just type
www.paypal.com in your browser. If you go directly to the PayPal site, follow
these steps:
1. If this is your first visit to the PayPal site, register.
If you’re already a registered user, go ahead and log in by following the
steps on-screen.
2. Click the Auction Tools tab and then scroll down and click Pay for an
Auction.
PayPal takes you step-by-step through the process of filling out a payment
form to identify the auction you’re paying for as well as your shipping infor-
mation. You’re all done. Your credit card information is held safely with
PayPal, and the payment is deposited into the seller’s PayPal account. The
seller receives notice of your payment and notifies you about how quickly he
or she will ship your item.
154
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

By paying with PayPal, you can instantly pay for an auction without hassle.
Your credit card information is kept private, and your payment is deposited
into the seller’s PayPal account.
You can always view your checkout status by going to your My eBay: All
Buying: Won area, shown in Figure 8-3. Click the drop-down menu in the
Action column for the item in question.
Keeping in Touch: Dealing 
with an AWOL Seller
The eBay community, like local towns and cities, is not without its problems.
With the millions of transactions that go on every week, transactional difficul-
ties do pop up now and then.
The most common problem is the AWOL seller — the kind of person who
pesters you for payment and then disappears. Just as you’re expected to
hustle and get your payment off to the seller within a week, the seller has 
an obligation to notify you within a week of receiving your payment with an
e-mail that says the item has been shipped. If you sent the money but you
haven’t heard a peep in a while, don’t jump the gun and assume the person is
trying to cheat you, but do follow up.

155
Chapter 8: After You Win the Item

Follow this week-by-week approach if you’ve already paid for the item but
haven’t heard from the seller:
 Week one, the gentle-nudge approach: Remind the seller with an e-mail
about the auction item, its number, and the closing date. “Perhaps this
slipped your mind and got lost in the shuffle of your other auctions” is a
good way to broach the subject. Chances are good that you’ll get an
apologetic e-mail about some family emergency or last-minute business
trip. You’ll find that the old saying “You can attract a lot more bees with
honey than with vinegar” works great at eBay.
 Week two, the civil-but-firm approach: Send an e-mail again. Be civil but
firm. Set a date for when you expect to be contacted. Meanwhile, tap into
some of eBay’s resources. See the section “Getting Contact Information,”
earlier in this chapter, to find out how to get an eBay user’s phone number.
After you have this information, you can send a follow-up letter or make
direct contact and set a deadline for some sort of action.
 Week three, take-action time: If you still haven’t heard from the seller,
e-mail the seller once more and let him or her know that you’re filing a
complaint. Then go to Trust & Safety and file a grievance for Item Not
Received or for one stating that the item is Significantly Not as Described.
Explain in detail what has transpired. eBay will launch its own internal
investigation. Turn to Chapter 16 to find out more about filing com-
plaints and using other tools to resolve problems.
You Get the Item (Uh-Oh What’s This?)
The vast majority of eBay transactions go without a hitch. You win, you send
your payment, you get the item, you check it out, you’re happy. If that’s the
case — a happy result for your auction — then skip this section and go leave
some positive feedback for the seller!
On the other hand, if you’re not happy with the item you receive, the seller
may have some ’splaining to do. E-mail or call the seller immediately and
politely ask for an explanation if the item isn’t as described. Some indications
of a foul-up are pretty obvious:
 The item’s color, shape, or size doesn’t match the description.
 The item’s scratched, broken, or dented in ways that don’t match the
description (the doll’s description was new, but the box is tattered and
the doll’s seen more than its share of action).
 You won an auction for a set of candlesticks and received a vase instead.
156
Part II: Are You Buying What They’re Selling? 

A snag in the transaction is annoying, but don’t get steamed right away.
Contact the seller and see whether you can work things out. Keep the conver-
sation civilized. The majority of sellers want a clean track record and good
feedback, so they’ll respond to your concerns and make things right. Assume
the best about the seller’s honesty, unless you have a real reason to suspect
foul play. Remember, you take some risks whenever you buy something that
you can’t touch. If the item has a slight problem that you can live with, leave
it alone and don’t go to the trouble of leaving negative feedback about an oth-
erwise pleasant, honest eBay seller.
Of course, while I can give you advice on what you deserve from a seller,
you’re the one who has to live with the item. If you and the seller can’t reach
a compromise and you really think you deserve a refund, ask for one.
If you paid the U.S. Postal Service to insure the item, and it arrives at your
home pretty well pulverized, call the seller to alert him or her about the prob-
lem. Find out the details of the insurance purchased by the seller. After you
have all the details, follow the seller’s instructions on how to make a claim. If
the item was shipped through the post office, take the whole mangled she-
bang back to the post office and talk to the good folks there about filing a
claim. Check out Chapter 12 for more tips on how to deal with a shipping cat-
astrophe. And jump over to Chapter 16 to find out how to file your eBay
and/or PayPal insurance claim.
Don’t Forget to Leave Feedback
Good sellers should be rewarded, and potential buyers should be informed.
That’s why no eBay transaction is complete until the buyer fills out the feed-
back form. Before leaving any feedback, though, always remember that some-
times no one’s really at fault when transactions get fouled up; communication
meltdowns can happen to anyone. (For more info on leaving feedback, see
Chapter 4.) Here are some scenarios that give you an idea on what kind of
feedback to leave for a seller:
 Positive: If the transaction could have been a nightmare, but the seller
really tried to make it right and meet you halfway, that’s an easy call —
give the seller the benefit of the doubt and leave positive feedback.
 Positive: Whenever possible, reward someone who seems honest or
tried to fix a bad situation. For example, if the seller worked at a snail’s
pace but you eventually got your item and you’re thrilled with it, you
may want to leave positive feedback with a caveat. Something like “Item
as described, good seller, but very slow to deliver” sends the right feed-
back message.
157
Chapter 8: After You Win the Item

 Neutral: If the seller worked at a snail’s pace and did adequate packag-
ing and the item was kinda-sorta what you thought, you may want to
leave neutral feedback; the transaction wasn’t bad enough for negative
but doesn’t deserve praise, either. Here’s an example of what you might
say: “Really slow to deliver, didn’t say item condition was good not
excellent, but did deliver.” Wishy-washy is okay as a response to so-so;
at least the next buyer will know to ask very specific questions.
 Negative: If the seller never shipped your item, or if the item didn’t
match the description when it arrived, and if the seller won’t make
things right, you need to leave negative feedback. Make sure that both
conditions apply, and never write negative feedback in the heat of the
moment and never make it personal. Keep it mellow and just state the
facts. Do expect a response but don’t get into a negative feedback war.
Life’s interesting enough without taking on extra hassles.
The Accidental Deadbeat might be an intriguing title for a movie someday, but
being a deadbeat isn’t much fun in real life. See Chapter 6 for details on

A
lot of different factors are at work when a seller
makes a nice profit on an item he or she has put up
for sale.
If you’re new to selling, you can find out all the benefits of
selling and get pointed in the right direction to find items
that could make you a tidy profit. In fact, you may be sit-
ting on major profits hiding in your own home! eBay has
its rules, though, so when you assess an item’s value to
prepare for your auction, you need to make sure the item
isn’t prohibited from being sold at the eBay site.
In this part, I walk you through the paperwork you need to
fill out to list an item for selling, and I show you how to
close the deal and ship the item without any hassles. But
even though I’m good, I can’t stop problems from occur-
ring, which is why I try to walk you through every con-
ceivable mishap. There’s also a chapter for those eBay
newbies out there who already know that a picture’s

to make money at eBay, you can’t miss the advanced
strategies.

F
inding items to sell can be as easy as opening up your closet and as chal-
lenging as acquiring antiques overseas (I even took the leap and imported
custom items from Taiwan to sell on eBay). Either way, establishing yourself
as an eBay seller isn’t that difficult when you know the ropes. In this chapter,
you find out how to look for items under your own roof, figure out what they’re
worth, and turn them into instant cash. But before you pick your house clean
(I know eBay can be habit-forming, but, please, keep a few things for your-
self!), read up on the eBay rules of the road — like how to sell, when to sell,
and what not to sell. If you’re interested in finding out how to set up your auc-
tion page, get acquainted with Chapter 10; if you want to read up on
advanced selling strategies, Appendix A is where to find them.
Why Should You Sell Stuff on eBay?
Whether you need to clear out 35 years of odd and wacky knickknacks clut-
tering your basement or you seriously want to earn extra money, the benefits
of selling at eBay are as diverse as the people doing the selling. The biggest
plus to selling at eBay is wheeling and dealing from your home in pajamas
and fuzzy slippers (every day is Casual Friday in my office). But no matter
where you conduct your business or how you dress, many more important
big-time rewards exist for selling at eBay.

Most people starting a business have to worry about rounding up investment
capital (start-up money they may lose), building inventory (buying stuff to
sell), and finding a selling location like a booth at a swap meet or even a small
store. Today, even a little Mom and Pop start-up operation requires a major
investment. eBay has helped to level the playing field a bit; everybody can
get an equal chance to start a small business with just a little money. Anyone
who wants to take a stab at doing business can get started with just enough
money to cover the Insertion Fee.
Get a few transactions under your belt. Sell your old collection of postcards. See
how you like the responsibilities of marketing, collecting money, shipping, and
customer service. Grow a bit more, and you’ll find yourself spotting trends,
acquiring inventory, and marketing your items for maximum profit. In no time,
you’ll be making items disappear faster than David Copperfield (though you
may have a little trouble with the Statue of Liberty — how’d he do that, any-
way?). If you think you’re ready to make eBay a full- or part-time business, take a
look at Appendix B. If you still want to go long on eBay, please take a look at my
book, Starting an eBay Business For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc). It gives you
just what you need to ramp up from hobbyist to big-time eBay tycoon making a
few hundred (or even thousand) dollars a month!
A fun way to get your feet wet on eBay is to buy some small items. When I say
small, I mean it. Some of the least expensive items you can buy on eBay are
recipes. Type recipe in the search box and sort the results by Lowest Prices
First. You’ll find recipes for a dollar and under. You don’t have to pay a ship-
ping charge, either. The sellers usually e-mail the recipe direct to you after
the auction. You can also begin selling your very own secret recipes. This is a

Life lessons learned at eBay
If you have kids, get them involved with your
eBay selling. They’ll learn real-life lessons they
can’t learn in school. Give them a feel for meet-
ing deadlines and fulfilling promises. Get them
writing e-mails (if they aren’t already) and help-
ing to pack the items. eBay is a great place to
learn basic economics and how to handle
money. When I first started on eBay, I taught my
pre-teen daughter about geography by using
eBay. Every time I completed a transaction, she
used a search engine to look up the city in
which the buyer (or seller) lived — and then
marked the city by placing a pin on a huge map
of the United States. She graduated from col-
lege, and coincidentally, majored in Business
and Marketing. Now she’s a research special-
ist for J.D. Power and Associates. (Thank you,
eBay!)
Get creative and make eBay a profitable learn-
ing experience, too. Remember, however, that
eBay doesn’t let anyone under the age of 18
register, buy, or sell — so make sure you’re in
charge of handling all transactions. Your kids
can help out, but they need to be under your
supervision at all times.

great way to become familiar with how eBay works, and you’ll be gaining
experience with feedback — as well as building yours!
Mi Casa, Mi Cash-a: Finding Stuff to Sell
Finding merchandise to sell at eBay is as easy as opening up a closet and 
as tough as climbing up to the attic. Just about anything you bought and
stashed away (because you didn’t want it, forgot about it, or it didn’t fit) is
fair game. Think about all those really awful birthday and holiday presents
(hey, it was the thought that counted — and the giver may have forgotten
about them, too). Now you have a place you can try to unload them. They
could even make somebody happy.
In your closet, find what’s just hanging around:
 Clothing that no longer fits or is out of fashion. (Do you really want to
keep it if you wouldn’t be caught dead in it or you know it will never fit?)
Don’t forget that pair of shoes you wore once and put away.
 Any item with a designer label that’s in new or almost-new condition.
 Kids’ clothes. (Kids outgrow things fast. Use profits from the old items to
buy new clothes they can grow into. Now that’s recycling.)
Have the articles of clothing in the best condition possible before you put them
up for sale. For example, shoes can be cleaned and buffed up till they’re like
new. According to eBay’s policies, clothing must be cleaned prior to shipping.
And consider what’s parked in your basement, garage, or attic:
 Old radios, stereo and video equipment, and 8-track systems: Watch
these items fly out of your house — especially the 8-track players
(believe it or not, people love ’em).
 Books you finished reading long ago and don’t want to read again:
Some books with early copyright dates or first editions by famous
authors earn big money at eBay.
 Leftovers from an abandoned hobby: (Who knew that building minia-
ture dollhouses was so much work?)
 Unwanted gifts: Have a decade’s worth of birthday, graduation, or holi-
day gifts collecting dust? Put them up at eBay and hope Grandma or
Grandpa doesn’t bid on them because they think you need another mus-
tache spoon!
163
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

Saleable stuff may even be lounging around in your living room or bedroom:
 Home décor you want to change: Lamps, chairs, and rugs (especially if
they’re antiques) sell quickly. If you think an item is valuable but you’re
not sure, get it appraised first.
 Exercise equipment: If you’re like most people, you bought this stuff
with every intention of getting in shape, but now all that’s building up is
dust. Get some exercise carrying all that equipment to the post office
after you’ve sold it at eBay.
 Records, videotapes, and laser discs: Sell them after you’ve upgraded to
new audio and video formats such as DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) or DAT
(Digital Audio Tape). (Think Betamax is dead? You may be surprised.)
 Autographs: All types of autographs — from sports figures, celebrities,
and world leaders — are very popular at eBay. A word of caution,
though: A lot of fakes are on the market, so make sure that what you’re
selling (or buying) is the real thing. If you’re planning on selling auto-
graphs on eBay, be sure to review the special rules that apply to these
items. Here’s where to find them:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/autographs.html
Know When to Sell
Warning . . . warning . . . I’m about to hit you with some of my clichés: Timing
is everything. Sell what you know and know when to sell. Buy low and sell high.
Okay, granted, clichés may be painful to hear over and over again, but they
do contain nuggets of good information. (Perhaps they’re well known for a
reason?)
Experienced eBay sellers know that when planning a sale, timing is almost
everything. Fur coats don’t sell very well in July, and as a collectible seller
you don’t want to be caught with 200 Nintendo games during a run on Xbox.
Superman action figures are traditionally good sellers unless a new Batman
movie is coming out.
Some items — such as good antiques, rugs, baseball cards, and sports cars —
are timeless. But timing still counts. Don’t put your rare, antique paper cutter
up for auction if someone else is selling one at the same time. I guarantee that
will cut into your profits.
164
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Timing is hardly an exact science. Rather, timing is a little bit of common
sense, a dash of marketing, and a fair amount of information gathering. Do a
little research among your friends. What are they interested in? Would they
buy your item? Use eBay itself as a research tool. Search to see whether
anyone’s making money on the same type of item. If people are crazed for
some fad item and you have a bunch, yesterday was the time to sell. (In other
words, if you want your money out of ’em, get crackin’ and get packin’.)
If the eBay market is already flooded with dozens of an item and no one is
making money on them, you can afford to wait before you plan your auction.
Know Thy Stuff
At least that’s what Socrates would have said if he’d been an eBay seller.
Haven’t had to do a homework assignment in a while? Time to dust off those
old skills. Before selling your merchandise, do some digging to find out as
much as you can about it.
165
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit
Snapping up profits
Way back in 1980, when Pac-Man ruled, my
friend Ric decided to try his hand at photogra-
phy. Hoping to be the next Ansel Adams — or to
at least snap something in focus — he bought
a 1/4 Kowa 66, one of those cameras you hold
in front of your belt buckle while you look down
into the viewfinder. Soon after he bought the
camera, Ric’s focus shifted. The camera sat in
its box, instructions and all, for over 15 years
until he threw a garage sale.
Ric and his wife didn’t know much about his
Kowa, but they knew that it was worth some-
thing. When he got an offer of $80 for it at the
garage sale, his wife whispered “eBay!” in his
ear, and he turned down the offer.
Ric and his wife posted the camera at eBay with
the little information they had about its size and
color, and the couple was flooded with ques-
tions and information about the camera from
knowledgeable bidders. One bidder said that
the silver-toned lens made it more valuable.
Another gave them the camera’s history.
Ric and his wife added each new bit of infor-
mation to their description and watched as the
bids increased with their every addition — until
that unused camera went for more than $400 in
a flurry of last-minute sniping in 1999. These
days, when Ric posts an auction, he always
asks for additional information and adds it to the
auction page.
What difference does a year make? You’ll learn
that the values of all items on eBay trend up and
down. In 2000, this camera sold at eBay for over
$600; in late 2001, it sold for $455. In the winter of
2003, interest in it was waning; it sold in the $375
to $400 range. Now there’s nary a one to be
found on eBay.

Getting the goods on your goods
Here are some ideas to help you flesh out your knowledge of what you have
to sell:
 Hit the books. Check your local library for books about the item. Study
price guides and collector magazines.
Even though collectors still use published price guides when they put a
value on an item, so much fast-moving e-commerce is on the Internet
that price guides often lag behind the markets they cover. Take their
prices with a grain of salt.
 Go surfin’. Conduct a Web search and look for info on the item on other
auction sites. If you find a print magazine that strikes your fancy, check
to see whether the magazine is available on the Web by typing the title
of the magazine into your browser’s search window. (For detailed infor-
mation on using search engines to conduct a more thorough online
search, check out Chapter 5.)
 When the going gets tough, go shopping. Browse local stores that spe-
cialize in your item. Price it at several locations.
When you understand what the demand for your product is (whether it’s
a collectible or a commodity) and how much you can realistically ask for
it, you’re on the right track to a successful auction.
 Call in the pros. Need a quick way to find the value of an item you want
to sell? Call a dealer or a collector and say you want to buy one. A mer-
chant who smells a sale will give you a current selling price.
166
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
Doing deep and thorough eBay research
eBay has a subscription service designed to
help sellers set online prices and better under-
stand the eBay marketplace. There’s no need to
pay for an outside company’s high-priced prod-
ucts. The service, Marketplace Research, gives
paid subscribers access to inside historical
eBay data through charts and graphs that help
you understand the demand for items you’re
planning to sell. When you subscribe, you can
view top searches within a category or skim the
entire site to see what buyers are searching for.
The charts provide information on the average
bids per item, the number of completed sales,
and more. You can dip into the service for only
$2.99 for a two-day pass. The two-day pass
enables you to go back and peruse up to 60
days of eBay records. With two days’ access,
you can easily look up bunches of items that
you have to sell. Visit http://pages.
ebay.com/marketplace_research/
for more details.

 eBay to the rescue. eBay offers some guidance for your research on its
category pages. eBay offers special features for each main category.
Click Buy on the navigation bar and select your favorite category. As you
scroll the page, eBay places links to stories and features specifically for
this category. Also, eBay has category-specific chat rooms, where you
can read what other collectors are writing about items in a particular
category. (See Chapter 17 for more on eBay’s Chat area.)
For information on how items are graded and valued by professional collec-
tors, jump to Chapter 5, where I discuss grading your items.
Be certain you know what you have — not only what it is and what it’s for, but
also whether it’s genuine. Make sure it’s the real McCoy. You are responsible
for your item’s authenticity; counterfeits and knock-offs are not welcome at
eBay. In addition, manufacturers’ legal beagles are on the hunt for counterfeit
and stolen goods circulating on eBay — and they will tip off law enforcement.
Spy versus spy: Comparison selling
Back in the old days, successful retailers like Gimbel and Macy spied on each
other to figure out ways to get a leg up on the competition. Today, in the
bustling world of e-commerce, the spying continues, and dipping into the
intrigue of surveilling the competition is as easy as clicking your mouse.
Say that you’re the biggest Dukes of Hazzard fan ever and you collect Dukes of
Hazzard stuff, such as VHS tapes from the show, movie memorabilia, General
Lee models, and lunchboxes. Well, good news: That piece of tin that holds your
lunchtime PB&J may very well fetch a nice sum of money. To find out for sure,
you can do some research at eBay. To find out the current market price for a
Dukes of Hazzard lunchbox, you can conduct a Completed Items search on the
Search page (as described in Chapter 5) and find out exactly how many Dukes
of Hazzard lunchboxes have been on the auction block in the past couple of
weeks. You can also find out their high selling prices and how many bids the
lunchboxes received by the time the auctions were over. And repeating a com-
pleted auction search in a week or two is not a bad idea — you can get at least
a month’s worth of data to price your item. Figure 9-1 shows the results of a
Completed Items search sorted by highest prices first.
You can easily save your searches on eBay. Just click the link in the top-right
corner (you can also see it in Figure 9-1) to add this to your favorite searches.
Then it’s on your My eBay Favorites page, and you can repeat the search with
a click of your mouse.
167
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

Sometimes sellers make spelling errors when they write item titles. In the
case of a Dukes of Hazzard lunchbox, when you conduct a search for such 
an item, I suggest that you use one of my favorite search tricks featured in
Chapter 5. The eBay search engine accommodates for one correction (as in
hazard and hazzard) but when you want to check for two variations, you
must input both. Type your search this way: dukes (hazzard,hazard) (“lunch
box”,lunchbox). (Be sure that you drop the noise word of). This way, you
find all instances of dukes hazzard lunchbox and dukes hazard lunchbox.
Sure enough, when I tried this tactic, I found a considerable number of 
additional listings for a Dukes of Hazzard Lunchbox. Coincidentally, when I
changed my search (remember, sellers do make mistakes) to dukes (haz-
zard,hazard) (“lunch box”,lunchbox), my search results went from 20 lunch-
boxes to 26! The best deals for buyers (and for sellers to resell) are always
when the seller misspells a name or brand in the title.
Always search for the same item with different word variations or spellings.
This is about the only time “creative” spelling can actually help you.
Look at the pictures on the individual auction item pages for each item that
your Completed Items search turns up. That way, you can confirm that the
items (lunchboxes, for example) are identical to the one you want to sell. And
when you do your research, factor in your item’s condition. Read the individ-
ual item descriptions. If your item is in better condition, expect (and ask for)
more money for it; if your item is in worse condition, expect (and ask for)

less. Also, note the categories the items are listed under; they may give you a
clue about where eBay members are looking for items just like yours.
If you want to be extremely thorough in your comparison selling, go to a
search engine to see whether the results of your eBay search mesh with
what’s going on elsewhere. If you find that no items like yours are for sale
anywhere else online, and are pretty sure people are looking for what you
have, you may just find yourself in Fat City.
Don’t forget to factor in the history of an item when you assess its value.
Getting an idea of what people are watching, listening to, and collecting can
help you assess trends and figure out what’s hot. For more about using trend-
spotting skills to sniff out potential profits, take a look at Appendix A.
Know What You Can (And Can’t) Sell
The majority of auctions found at eBay are aboveboard. But sometimes eBay
finds out about auctions that are either illegal (in the eyes of the state or fed-
eral government) or prohibited by eBay’s rules and regulations. In either
case, eBay steps in, calls a foul, and makes the auction invalid.
eBay doesn’t have rules and regulations just for the heck of it. eBay wants to
keep you educated so you won’t unwittingly bid on — or sell — an item that
has been misrepresented. eBay also wants you to know what’s okay and
what’s prohibited so that if you run across an auction that looks fishy, you’ll
help out your fellow eBay members by reporting it. And eBay wants you to
know that getting your auction shut down is the least of your worries: You
can be suspended if you knowingly list items that are prohibited. And I won’t
even talk about criminal prosecution.
You need to know about these three categories at eBay:
 Prohibited lists the items that may not be sold at eBay under any 
circumstances.
 Questionable lists the items that may be sold under certain conditions.
 Potentially Infringing lists the types of items that may be in violation of
copyrights, trademarks, or other rights.
You may not even offer to give away for free a prohibited or infringing item,
nor can you give away a questionable item that eBay disallows; giving it away
doesn’t relieve you of potential liability.
169
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

The items that you absolutely cannot sell at eBay can fit into all three cate-
gories. Those items can be legally ambiguous at best — not to mention
potentially risky and all kinds of sticky. To find a detailed description of
which items are prohibited on the eBay Web site, follow these steps:
1. Click the Policies link on the bottom of all eBay pages.
You arrive at the friendly eBay Policies page.
2. Scroll to the Prohibited and Restricted items link and click.
Ta-da! Finally you are presented with the lists and links that will help you
decipher whether selling your item falls within eBay’s boundaries.
Or, if you don’t mind typing, you can go directly to pages.ebay.com/
help/sell/item_allowed.html.
Sometimes an item is okay to own but not to sell. Other times the item is 
prohibited from being sold and possessed. To complicate matters even more,
some items may be legal in one part of the United States but not in others. Or
an item may be illegal in the United States but legal in other countries.
Because eBay’s base of operations is in California, United States law is
enforced — even if both the buyer and seller are from other countries. Cuban
cigars, for example, are legal to buy and sell in Canada, but even if the buyer and
the seller are from Canada, eBay says “No permiso” and shuts down auctions of
Havanas fast. Figure 9-2 shows an auction that was shut down soon after I found it.
Prohibited items
Even though possessing (and selling) many of the items in the following list is
legal in the United States and elsewhere, you are absolutely, positively prohib-
ited from buying and selling the following at eBay:
 Firearms of all types: This also means firearm accessories — including
antique, collectible, sport, or hunting guns; air guns; BB guns; silencers;
converters; kits for creating guns; gunpowder; high-capacity ammunition
magazines (receptacles designed to feed ten rounds or more into a gun,
not the publications about ammo); and armor-piercing bullets. You can’t
even sell a gun that doesn’t work.
You can buy and sell single bullets, shells, and even antique bombs and
musket balls — as long as they have nothing explosive in them.
 Firearms and military weapons: No way can you sell any type of firearm
that is designed to propel a metal (or similar) projectile, regardless of
whether it works. Military weapons? Items included are bazookas,
grenades, and mortars.
170
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 Police and other law-enforcement badges and IDs: Stop in the name of
the law if you’re thinking about buying or selling any of these items, includ-
ing actual United States federal badges or imitation badges. In fact, selling
just about any U.S. government badge can get you in hot water.
You also can’t own or sell those agencies’ identification cards or creden-
tial cases or those really cool jackets they use in raids. Selling a copy or
reproduction of any of these items is prohibited, too, because these items
are copyrighted (see the section on infringing items in this chapter).
If you find a badge that’s legal to sell and own, you need to provide a
letter of authorization from the agency. The same letter of authorization
is required for fake badges, such as reproductions or movie props.
 Replicas of official government identification documents or licenses:
Birth certificates, drivers’ licenses, and passports fall into this category.
 Current vehicle license plates or plates that claim to resemble current
ones: Note that expired license plates (at least 5 years old) are consid-
ered collectible — as long as they are no longer valid for use on a vehicle.
 Locksmithing devices: These items can be sold only to authorized recip-
ients. Federal law prohibits the mailing of such devices.

171
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

 Human parts and remains: Hey, we all have two kidneys, but if you get
the urge to sell one to pay off your bills, eBay is not the place to sell it.
You can’t sell your sperm, eggs, blood, or anything else you manage to
extricate from your body. What’s more, you can’t even give away any of
these items as a free bonus with one of your auctions.
 Drugs or drug paraphernalia: Narcotics, steroids, or other controlled
substances may not be listed, as well as gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB).
Drug paraphernalia includes all items that are primarily intended or
designed for use in manufacturing, concealing, or using a controlled sub-
stance, including 1960s-vintage cigarette papers, bongs, and water pipes.
 Anything that requires a prescription from a doctor, dentist, or
optometrist to dispense: Listen, just because it’s legal to use doesn’t
mean it doesn’t require special permission to get. For example, even
though penicillin is legal to buy in the United States, only a doctor can
prescribe it — which is why, when you get sick, you have to stand in that
loooong line at the pharmacy sneezing on all the other sick people. And
if you’re looking for Viagra auctions at eBay, don’t even go there.
 Stocks, bonds, or negotiable securities: Nope, you can’t sell stock in
your new pie baking company or an investment in property you may
own. And if you’re thinking of offering credit to someone, you can’t do
that either. (Note that antiques and collectible items are permitted.)
 Bulk e-mail lists: No bulk e-mail or mailing lists that contain personal
identifying information. You may not even sell tools or software
designed to send unsolicited commercial e-mail.
 Pets and wildlife, including animal parts from endangered species: If
you’ve had it with Buster, your pet ferret, don’t look to eBay for help in
finding him a new home. And you can’t sell your stuffed spotted owls or
rhino-horn love potions, either. If you’re in the animal business — any
animal business — eBay is not the place for you.
 Child pornography: Note that this material is strictly prohibited at
eBay, but you can sell other forms of erotica. (See the section later in
this chapter about questionable items.)
 Forged items: Autographs from celebrities and sports figures are big busi-
ness — and a big opportunity for forgers. Selling a forgery is a criminal
act. The state of New York is taking the lead on this issue, investigating at
least two dozen suspected forgery cases linked with online auctions.
If you’re in the market for an autograph, don’t even consider bidding on
one unless it comes with a Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Many sellers
take authenticity so seriously that they give buyers the right to a full
refund if any doubt about authenticity crops ups. Figure 9-3 shows an
item that comes with a COA from an auction at eBay. Find out more
about authentication services in Chapter 16.
172
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 Items that infringe on someone else’s copyright or trademark: Take a
look at the very next section for details on infringing items.
 Satellite and cable TV descramblers: Although the Internet is loaded
with hardware and instructions on how to get around cable TV scram-
bling, eBay prohibits the sales of anything in this arena. After all, it is ille-
gal to get around these technologies.
 Stolen items: Need I say more? (Seems obvious, but you’d be surprised.)
If what you’re thinking about selling came to you by way of a five-finger
discount, fell off a truck, or is hot, don’t sell it at eBay.
Ignorance is no excuse. If you list an item that’s in any way prohibited on
eBay, eBay will end your auction. If you have any questions, always check
eBay’s Trust & Safety department at pages.ebay.com/help/sell/item_
allowed.html.
Infringing items
In school, if you copied someone’s work, you were busted for plagiarism.
Even if you’ve been out of school for a while, you can get busted for copying
someone else’s work. Profiting from a copy of someone else’s legally owned
intellectual property is an infringement violation. Infringement, also known as
piracy, is the encroachment on another person’s legal ownership rights on an
item, a trademark, or a copyright. eBay prohibits the selling of infringing
items at its site.

Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

All the legal mumbo-jumbo, translated to English, comes down to this:
Profiting from someone else’s idea, original work, or patented invention is
very, very bad and can get you in hot water.
Here’s a checklist of no-no items commonly found at the center of infringe-
ment violations:
 Music that’s been recorded from an original compact disc, cassette tape,
or record.
 Movies that have been recorded from an original DVD, laser disc, or
commercial VHS tape.
 Television shows that have been recorded off the air, off cable, or from a
satellite service.
Selling a used original CD, tape, commercial VHS movie cassette, DVD, or
CD-ROM is perfectly legal. Some television shows have sold episodes on
tape; you can sell those originals as well. But if you’re tempted to sell a
personal copy that you made of an original, you are committing an
infringing violation.
 Software and computer games that have been copied from CD-ROMs or
disks (and that includes hard drives — anybody’s).
 Counterfeit items (also called knock-offs), such as clothes and jewelry,
that have been produced, copied, or imitated without the permission of
the manufacturer. (Bart Simpson knock-off T-shirts abounded in the
early ’90s.)
If you pick up a brand-name item dirt cheap from a discount store, you can
check to see whether it’s counterfeit by taking a look at the label. If some-
thing isn’t quite right, the item is probably a knock-off.

Hot property busted
In 1961, a young jockey named John Sellers
won his first Kentucky Derby on a horse named
Carry Back. He was so emotional about the vic-
tory that he was crying as he crossed the finish
line. Seventeen years later, someone broke into
his California home and stole his priceless
trophy. But today, more than two decades after
it was stolen, it’s back in his possession —
thanks to an observant eBay member. The
prized trophy was put up for auction in 1999 by
a seller who had bought it legitimately. An eBay
member who knows the history of the trophy
saw that it was for sale and alerted the seller.
The seller stopped the auction immediately,
contacted the former jockey, and personally
returned the trophy to him. Now that’s a great
finish!

Trademark and copyright protection don’t just cover software, music, and
movies. Clothing, toys, sunglasses, and books are among the items covered
by law.
Intellectual property owners actively defend their rights and, along with help
from average eBay users, continually tip off eBay to fraudulent and infringing
auctions. Rights owners can use eBay’s Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) pro-
gram, as well as law-enforcement agencies. (See “VeRO to the Rescue,” later
in this chapter, for info about the VeRO program.)
Questionable items: Know the laws
Because some items are prohibited in one place and not another, eBay lists a
few items that you can trade but that are restricted and regulated. As a member
of eBay, you’re responsible for knowing the restrictions in your area — as well
as those on the eBay Web site.
Certain items are illegal in one geographic area and not another. This list
mentions a few of the major questionables:
 Event tickets: Laws regarding the sale of event tickets vary from state to
state, even city to city. Some laws prohibit reselling the ticket for a price
higher than the amount printed on the face of the ticket. Some states
limit the amount you can add to the ticket’s face value.
If you’re planning to sell event tickets, visit pages.ebay.com/help/
policies/event-tickets.html for details. This page has details fea-
turing the various states’ legal requirements. Be sure to double-check this
page to be certain you’re following the appropriate laws for your area.
 Wine and alcohol: Selling wine and alcohol at eBay — and anywhere
else, for that matter — is tricky business. For starters, you have no busi-
ness in this business unless you’re at least 21 years old. eBay does not
permit sales of any alcohol products unless they are sold for their “col-
lectible” containers. You may sell alcoholic beverages for consumption if
you have a liquor license and are preapproved by eBay. In the case of
collectible bottles, some strict rules apply:
• The value must be in the collectible container, not in its contents.
You can’t auction off your uncle’s Chateaux Margaux because the
value is in the wine — not the bottle.
• The bottle must be unopened, and your auction must state that the
contents are not meant for consumption.
• The container’s value must substantially exceed the price of the alco-
hol in the container, and it must not be available at a retail outlet.
175
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

• You must be sure that the buyer is at least 21 years old.
• You must be sure that the sale complies with all laws and shipping
rules. Every state has its own laws about shipping alcohol and
wine. Some states require licenses to transport it; some limit the

 Erotica: Some forms of erotica are allowed at eBay. To see what eBay
allows and what it prohibits, type pages.ebay.com/help/policies/
mature-audiences.html into your browser.
One thing that’s definitely illegal, wrong, and criminal is child pornogra-
phy. If someone reports that you’re selling child pornography, eBay for-
wards your registration information to law enforcement for criminal
prosecution.
Forbidden auctions
The folks at eBay didn’t just fall off the turnip truck. eBay staffers have seen
just about every scam to get around paying fees or following policy guide-
lines. Chances are good that if you try one of these scams, you’ll get caught.
Then eBay cancels the auction. Do it once, and shame on you (don’t count on
getting the listing fee credited back to you). Do it a lot, and you’re off of eBay.
The following items are definitely forbidden:
 Raffles and prizes: You need to sell something in your auction; you can’t
offer tickets or chances for a giveaway.
 Want ads: If you want something, you have to search for it. Don’t try 
to run your needs as an ad thinly disguised as an auction. Visit eBay’s
Want-It-Now (pages.ebay.com/wantitnow/) section and legally post
your wants and needs there.
 Advertisements: An eBay auction is not the place to make a sales pitch
(other than attractive copy describing your item, that is). Some eBay
bad guys list an auction name and then use the auction to send bidders
176
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

to some other auction or Web site. The Real Estate category is one
exception. You can run an ad there for your property. Look out for eBay
to expand its ads in the future.
 Bait-and-switch tactics: These are a variation on the ugly old sales tech-
nique of pretending to sell what you’re not really selling. Some eBay
users who are selling an unfamiliar brand of item try to snag bidders by
putting a more familiar brand in the title. For instance, writing Designer
Chanel purse — not really, but a lot like it! is a fake-out. eBay calls it key-
word spamming. I call it lousy.
 Choice auctions: These are like Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions gone
crazy. Normally, sellers can offer only one item per auction in a regular
auction and multiples of the same item in a Multiple Item auction.
Choice auctions offer a mishmash of multiple items from which bidders
choose. For example, if you’re selling T-shirts, an auction can be for only
one particular size per sale. If you want to list small, medium, and large
sizes, I suggest that you run an auction for one size and open an eBay
store (see Chapter 11) where you can list single sales for each size.
 Mixing apples with oranges: This gambit tries to attract more bidders
to view an item by putting it in a high-traffic category where it doesn’t
belong. Forget it. eBay will move it for you if necessary, but keeping that
rutabaga recipe book away from the list of automotive repair manuals is
more considerate.
 Catalogs: “Buy my catalog so you can buy more stuff from me!” Uh-huh. I
don’t know why anyone would put a bid on a catalog (unless it’s a Sears-
Roebuck antique). If it’s only a booklet that shows off all the cool junk
you’re selling, you can’t offer it as an auction item.
Reporting a Problem Listing
You probably don’t think that eBay can monitor millions of items for sale on a
daily basis. You’re right; it can’t. eBay relies on eBay members like you to let
it know when a shady listing is afoot. If you ever smell something fishy, for
goodness’ sake, report it to eBay. Sometimes eBay takes a few days to cancel
a listing, but rest assured that eBay invests a lot of time protecting its users
from fraudulent auctions.
If you see something that just doesn’t look right, you should report the auc-
tion via an online form at one of the following addresses (you can find also a
Report This Item link at the bottom of every eBay item listing page):
pages.ebay.com/help/contact_us/_base/index_selection.
htmlpages.ebay.com/securitycenter/

Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

eBay doesn’t personally prosecute its users. However, eBay does have a stake
in protecting its honest users — and will act as an intermediary between
honest eBay users and law-enforcement agencies.
VeRO to the Rescue
If you own intellectual property that you think is being infringed upon on the
eBay site, eBay has a program called the Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) pro-
gram. Owners of trademarked or copyrighted items and logos, as well as other
forms of intellectual property, can become members of this program for free.
You can find out more about the VeRO program by clicking the Help link
above the main navigation bar. To get eBay’s current VeRO policy, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/tp/vero-rights-owner.html. Read the infor-
mation, and if you qualify, click to download the form, fill it out, and fax it to
eBay. Then you’re on your way to protecting your intellectual property from
being auctioned to the highest bidder. Remember, only you can stop the
infringement madness. If eBay agrees with you that your intellectual property
is being infringed upon, it invalidates the auction and informs the seller by
e-mail that the auction “is not authorized.” The high bidders in the auction
are also notified and warned that they may be breaking the law if they con-
tinue the transaction.
eBay understands that sometimes people don’t know that they’re selling
infringing items, but it draws a hard line on repeat offenders. eBay not only
shuts down the offenders’ auctions, but also suspends repeat offenders of
this ilk. Also, eBay cooperates with the proper authorities on behalf of its
VeRO program members.
If eBay deems your auction invalid because the item doesn’t meet eBay’s poli-
cies and guidelines, you can find out why by checking the page at pages.
ebay.com/help/tp/listing-ended.html. If you still feel you’re in the
right, scroll down the page to the Contact Us link. Click there to plead your case.
eBay Fees? What eBay Fees? Oops . . .
The Cliché Police are going to raid me sooner or later, but here’s one I’m
poking a few holes in this time around: You gotta spend it to make it. This old-
time business chestnut means that you need to invest a fair amount of money
before you can turn a profit. Although the principle still holds true in the real
world (at least most of the time), at eBay you don’t have to spend much to
run your business. This is one reason why eBay has become one of the most
successful e-commerce companies on the Internet and a darling of Wall
Street. eBay keeps fees low and volume high.
178
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

eBay charges the following types of fees for conducting auctions:
 Regular auction and core fixed-price Insertion Fees ($0.20 to $4.80).
 Real estate listing fees. These can vary because you have the choice of list-
ing your property as an ad rather than an auction. Because eBay real estate
auctions are non-binding (due to legalities), you may be better off running
an ad. eBay charges different prices for different types of real estate:
• Timeshares, Manufactured Homes, and Land
Auctions: 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-day listing ($35); 30-day listing ($50)
Ad format: 30-day listing ($150); 90-day listing ($300)
• Residential, Commercial, and Other Real Estate
Auctions: 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-day listing ($100); 30-day listing ($150)
Ad format: 30-day listing ($150), 90-day listing ($300)
 Automotive fees ($40); motorcycles are only $30.
 Additional reserve-auction fees, which are refundable if your item meets
the reserve and sells ($1 to $2; auctions with reserves over $200, 1 per-
cent of the reserve with a maximum of $50).
 Final value fees (a percentage of the sales price).
 Optional fees (vary).
Insertion Fees
Every auction is charged an Insertion Fee. There’s no way around it. The
Insertion Fee is calculated on a sliding scale that’s based on the minimum bid
(your starting price) or on the reserve price (the secret lowest price that
you’re willing to sell your item for) of your item. (Later in this chapter, I
explain how the reserve price affects what you eventually have to pay.) 
Take a look at Table 9-1 for eBay’s Insertion Fee structure.
Table 9-1

Starting (Or Reserve) Price
The Insertion Fee Is
$0.01–$0.99
$0.20

$50.00–$199.99
$2.40
$200.00–$499.99
$3.60
$500–gazillions
$4.80
If you’re running a reserve-price auction (explained in detail in Chapter 10),
eBay bases its Insertion Fee on the reserve price, not the starting bid. eBay
also charges a fee to run a reserve-price auction.
Here’s a snapshot of how a reserve price affects your Insertion Fee. If you set
a starting bid of $1 for a gold Rolex watch (say what?) but your reserve price
is $5,000 (that’s more like it), you’re charged a $4.80 Insertion Fee based on
the $5,000 reserve price plus a $50 reserve fee (1 percent of Reserve Price, up
to $50). The reserve fee is refundable if the item sells. (See Table 9-4, later in
this chapter, for the reserve auction fees.)
In a Multiple Item (Dutch) auction (explained in Chapter 10), the Insertion
Fee is based on the starting bid — as in a regular auction — but then eBay
multiplies it by the number of items you list. So if you set a minimum bid of
$1 for 300 glow-in-the-dark refrigerator magnets, you pay a $3.60 Insertion Fee
for the listing.
So what does the Insertion Fee buy you at eBay?
 A really snazzy-looking auction page of your item that millions of eBay mem-
bers can see, admire, and breathlessly respond to. (Well, I can only hope.)
 The use of eBay services, such as the Trust & Safety program, which
protects your auction experience. (Chapter 16 tells you how to use Trust
& Safety during and after your auctions.)
Final Value Fees
If you follow the movie business, you hear about some big A-list stars who
take a relatively small fee for making a film but negotiate a big percentage of
the gross profits. This is known as a back-end deal — in effect, a commission
based on how much the movie brings in. eBay does the same thing, taking a
small Insertion Fee when you list your item and then a commission on the
back end when you sell your item. This commission is called the Final Value
Fee and is based on the final selling price of your item.
180
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

eBay doesn’t charge a Final Value Fee on an auction in the Real Estate/
Timeshares category as in other categories. You pay a flat Final Value Fee of
$35 for Timeshares, Manufactured Homes and Land, and no fees for Commercial
or Residential. But in the Automotive category, you pay a flat Transaction
Services Fee of $40 for passenger vehicles and $30 for motorcycles if your auc-
tion ends with a winning bidder (and the reserve has been met).
In real life, when you pay sales commissions on a big purchase like a house,
you usually pay a fixed percentage. eBay’s Final Value Fee structure is differ-
ent: It’s set up as a three-tiered system. Table 9-2 covers the calculation of
Final Value Fees.
Table 9-2
Final Value Fees
Closing Bid
To Find Your Final Value Fee
$.01–$25
Multiply the final sale price by 5.25 percent. If the final sale
price is $25, multiply 25 by 5.25 percent. You owe eBay
$1.31.
$25.01–$1,000
You pay $1.31 for the first $25 of the final sale price (which is
5.25 percent). Subtract $25 from your final closing bid and
then multiply this amount by 3 percent. Add this total to the
$1.31 you owe for the first $25. The sum is what you owe
eBay. If the final sale price is $1,000, multiply 975 by 0.03.
(Hint: The answer is $29.25.) Now, add $29.25 and $1.31. You
owe eBay $30.56.
$1,000.01 and over
You owe $1.31 for the first $25 of the final sale price (which
is 5.25 percent). But you also have to pay $29.25 for the
remainder of the price between $25.01 through $1,000
(which is 3 percent). This amount is $30.56. Now, subtract
$1,000 from the final sale price (you’ve already calculated
those fees) and multiply the final sale amount that is over
$1,000 by 1. 5 percent. Add this amount to $30.56. The sum is
the amount you owe eBay. If the final sales price is $3,000,
multiply $2,000 by 1.5 percent. (Hint: The answer is $30.)
Add $30.56 to $30. The sum, $60.56, is what you owe eBay.
(You won’t be graded on this.)
So how do all these percentages translate to actual dollar amounts? Take a
look at Table 9-3. I calculated the Final Value Fees on some sample selling
prices.

1.5 percent of $999,000
If you try to work out your own Final Value Fees, you may get an extreme
headache — and come up with fractional cents. Know that eBay rounds up
fees of $0.005 and more, and below $0.005, drops it. These roundings are
done on a per-transaction basis, and generally even out over time.
Always keep track of the exact amount. Here’s why (you’re gonna love this):
An item that is sold for $37.89 will show a Final Value Fee of $1.67 on the View
Account Status page (and in other areas where Final Value Fees are dis-
played), although the exact amount of the Final Value Fee is $1.670275. For
display purposes the additional digits are rounded to the closest cent on
invoices and other pages. However, the exact amount ($1.670275) — not the
displayed amount — is used to calculate the total amount due on your
invoice. Therefore, if several items have been sold, multiple line items show-
ing final account fees that have been rounded to the nearest cent will appear
on invoices and other pages, and the correctly calculated total balance will
appear to be off by one or a few cents. (In other words, eBay charges you
those fractions of a cent.) Here’s where you can get further details:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/rounding-account-
balance.html
If you’re starting to get dizzy just reading these examples, perhaps doing your
own calculations isn’t for you. It’s certainly not for me — this stuff makes my
eyes glaze over! Fortunately, there’s a very cool online calculator that can
handle all these calculations for you. Use it at
www.sellathon.com/ebay_calculator.html
182
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Because of the sliding percentages, the higher the final selling price, the
lower the commission eBay charges. (I guess math can be a beautiful thing,
when applied for my benefit.)
Optional fees
You don’t have to pay a license fee and destination charge, but setting up
your auction can be like buying a car. eBay has all sorts of options to jazz up
your auction. (Sorry, eBay is fresh out of two-tone metallic paint — but how
about a nice pair of fuzzy dice for your mirror?) I explain how all these bells,
whistles, and white sidewalls dress up your auction in Chapter 10.

When you’ve done all the legwork needed to make some money, do some eye-
work to keep track of your results. The best place to keep watch on your
eBay accounting is on your My eBay page, a great place to stay organized
while you’re conducting all your eBay business. (I describe all the functions
of the page in Chapter 4.)

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Here’s a checklist of what to watch out for after the auction closes:
 Keep an eye on how much you’re spending to place items up for auc-
tion at eBay. You don’t want any nasty surprises, and you don’t want to
find out that you spent more money to set up your auction than you
received selling your item.
 If you decide to turn your eBay selling into a business, keep track of
your expenses for your taxes. (I explain Uncle Sam’s tax position at
eBay later in this chapter — next, in fact. Stay tuned.)
 Make sure that you get refunds and credits when they’re due.
 Double-check your figures to make certain eBay hasn’t made mis-
takes. If you have any questions about the accounting, let eBay know.

Uncle Sam Wants You — 
to Pay Your Taxes
What would a chapter about money be without taxes? As Ben Franklin knew
(and we’ve all found out since his time), you can’t escape death and taxes.
(C’mon, it’s not a cliché; it’s traditional wisdom.) Whether in cyberspace or
face-to-face life, never forget that Uncle Sam is always your business partner.
If you live outside the United States, check the tax laws in that country so
you don’t end up with a real headache down the road.
As with offline transactions, knowledge is power. The more you know about
buying and selling at eBay before you actually start doing it, the more savvy
the impression you make — and the more satisfying your experience.
For more details on taxes and bookkeeping, check out my book, Starting an
eBay Business For Dummies by yours truly (Wiley).
Two wild rumors about federal taxes
I’ve heard some rumors about not having to pay taxes on eBay profits. If you
hear any variation on this theme, smile politely and don’t believe a word of it.
I discuss two of the more popular (and seriously mistaken) tax notions run-
ning around the eBay community these days.
185
Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

The U.S. government uses two laws on the books to go after eBay outlaws.
One is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, which prohibits deceptive
or misleading transactions in commerce. The other is the Mail or Telephone
Order Merchandise Rule, which requires sellers to ship merchandise in a
timely manner or offer to refund a consumer’s money. The FTC is in charge of
pursuing these violations. If you have a question about federal laws, you can
find a lot of information online. For example, I found these three Web sites
that keep fairly current lists of U.S. law and federal codes:
www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode
www.ftc.gov
www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/ustax.html
Rumor #1: E-commerce isn’t taxed
One story claims that “there will be no taxes on e-commerce sales (sales con-
ducted online) for three years.” No one ever seems to know when those three
years start or end.
Some people confuse state sales tax issues with income tax issues. You don’t
pay Internet sales taxes, but that’s not the same as not reporting income from
the Internet or selling within your home state.
Congress’s Internet Tax Freedom Act stated that until October 2001, Congress
and state legislatures couldn’t institute new taxes on Internet transactions.
President Bush signed a unanimously approved law that extended (through
November 1, 2003) a ban on multiple and discriminatory Internet taxes and
Internet-access taxes. (The moratorium did not apply to sales taxes or federal
taxes.) The legislation also lengthened the “Sense of the Congress” resolution
that there should be no federal taxes on Internet access or electronic com-
merce, and that the United States should work aggressively through the EU
(European Union) and WTO (World Trade Organization) to keep electronic
commerce free from tariffs and discriminatory taxes.
Even though November 1, 2003, has passed, there’s still discussion about the
law. Some people want to exempt online merchants if they bring in less than
$25,000 per year. Others say no taxes should be imposed unless the merchant
has sales of $5 million a year.
There is something new on the horizon, the Streamlined Sales Tax Project
(SSTA). Although the name of this government project may make it sound like
the states will be charging state sales tax on all e-commerce purchases, the
reality isn’t that simple. The battle is ongoing — and though I don’t feel that
eBay sellers with sales under $100,000 a year have much to fear, I still recom-
mend that you do a Google search on the SSTA every once in a while to keep
up to date.
186
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

As of this writing, the rules are up in the air. Please continue to check my Web
site, www.coolebaytools.com, for news on the SSTA when it applies.
Rumor #2: Profits from garage sales are tax-exempt
“eBay is like a garage sale, and you don’t have to pay taxes on garage sales.”
(Uh-huh. And the calories in ice cream don’t count if you eat it out of the
carton. Who comes up with this stuff anyway?)
This notion is just an urban (or shall I say suburban) legend — somebody’s
wishful thinking that’s become folklore. If you make money on a garage sale,
you have to declare it as income — just like anything else you make money
on. Most people never make any money on garage sales because they usually
sell things for far less than they bought them for. However, the exact opposite
is often true of an eBay transaction.
Even if you lose money, you may have to prove it to the government, espe-
cially if you’re running a small business. You most definitely should have a
heart-to-heart talk with your accountant or tax professional as to how to file
your taxes. Remember that if something might look bad in an audit if you
don’t declare it, consider that a big hint.
To get the reliable word, I checked with the IRS’s e-commerce office. The
good folks there told me that even if you make as little as a buck on any eBay
sale after all your expenses (the cost of the item, eBay fees, shipping
charges), you still have to declare it as income on your federal tax return.
If you have questions about eBay sales and your taxes, check with your per-
sonal accountant, call the IRS Help Line at 800-829-1040, or visit the IRS Web
site at www.irs.ustreas.gov. And be friendly. (Just in case.)
State sales tax
If your state has sales tax, a sales tax number is required before you officially
sell something. If sales tax applies, you may have to collect the appropriate
sales tax for every sale that falls within the state that your business is in. A
1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision said that states can only require sellers
that have a physical presence in the same state as the consumer to collect
so-called use taxes.
To find the regulations for your state, visit one of the following sites, which
supply links to every state’s tax board. The tax board should have the
answers to your questions.

Chapter 9: Selling in Your Fuzzy Slippers for Fun and Profit

State income taxes
Yes, it’s true. Not only is Uncle Sam in Washington, D.C., looking for his slice
of your eBay profits, but your state government may be hankering to join the
feast.
If you have a good accountant, give that esteemed individual a call. If you
don’t have one, find a tax professional in your area. Tax professionals actually
do more than just process your income tax returns once a year; they can help
you avoid major pitfalls even before April 15.
Here’s how to find out what your responsibilities are in your home state:
 You may need to collect and pay state sales taxes, but only if you sell to
someone in your state.
 You can get tax information online at this Web site:
www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/tax_stru.html
The site has links to tax information for all 50 states.
 You can also call your state tax office and let the good folks there
explain what the requirements are. The state tax office should be listed
in the government section of your phone book.

A
re you ready to make some money? Yes? (Call it an inspired guess.)
You’re on the threshold of adding your items to the hundreds of thou-
sands that go up for sale on eBay every day. Some listings are so hot that the
sellers quadruple their investments. Other items, unfortunately, are so stone
cold that they may not even register a single bid.
In this chapter, I explain all the facets of the Sell Your Item page — the page
you fill out to get your auction going at eBay. You get some advice that can
increase your odds of making money, and you find out the best way to posi-
tion your item so buyers can see it and bid on it. I also show you how to
modify, relist, or end your auction whenever you need to.
A little caveat here: In order to keep the marketplace vibrant, eBay’s pro-
grammers are constantly working to improve the site. Improvement means
change and the form (as I describe in this chapter) can change from time to
time. But the basic decisions that you need to make do not. The selling phi-
losophy laid out in this chapter should help you ride the waves of change on
eBay — whatever they may be.

Getting Ready to List Your Item
After you decide what you want to sell, find out as much as you can about it
and conduct a little market research. Then you should have a good idea of
the item’s popularity and value. To get this info, check out Chapter 9.
Before you list your item, make sure that you’ve got these bases covered:
 The specific category under which you want the item listed. Ask your
friends or family where they’d look for such an item and remember the
categories you saw most frequently when you conducted your market
research with the eBay search function.
To find out which category will pay off best for your item, run a search
and then check Completed Listings. See how many of the item are selling
now (and if people are actually bidding on it). Then scroll down to the
left of the page and click the Show Only Completed Listings box. Then,
sort your results by highest prices first and then look over the sales to
see which categories they’re listed in. For more information on how to
get ahead of the crowd through eBay’s search, visit Chapter 5.
 What you want to say in your item description. Jot down your ideas.
Take a good look at your item and make a list of keywords that describe
your item. Keywords are single descriptive words that can include (this
is hardly an complete list)
• Brand names
• Size of the item (citing measurements if appropriate)

I know all about writer’s block. If you’re daunted by the Sell Your Item
page, struggle through it anyway. This way you’ve already done the hard
work before you even begin.
 Whether you want to attach a picture (or pictures) to your description
via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Pictures help sell items, but you
don’t have to use them. (This information won’t be on the test, but if you
want to know more about using pictures in your auctions, see Chapter 14.)
 The price at which you think you can sell the item. Be as realistic as
you can. (That’s where the market research comes in.)

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Examining the Sell Your Item Page
The Sell Your Item form is where your listing is born. Filling out your online
paperwork requires a couple of minutes of clicking, typing, and answering all
kinds of questions. The good news is that when you’re done, your listing is
up and running and (hopefully) starting to earn you money.
Before you begin, you have to be a registered eBay user. If you still need to
register, go to Chapter 2 and fill out the preliminary online paperwork. If
you’ve registered but haven’t provided eBay with your financial information
(credit card or checking account), you’ll be asked for this information to set
up your seller account before you proceed. Fill in the data on the secure
form. Then you’re ready to roll.
Just like the dizzying menu in a Chinese restaurant, you have four ways to
sell an item on eBay. Four ways may not seem to be very dizzying, unless
you’re trying to psychically decide just which format is the best for you.
Here’s what you need to know about each type:
 Online Auction: This is the tried-and-true traditional sale format on
eBay. This is what the newbies look for, and you can combine this with a
Buy It Now for those who want the item immediately. Often, if you’re sell-
ing a collectible item, letting it go to auction may net you a much higher
profit — remember to do your research before listing.
 Fixed Price: Just like shopping at the corner store, a fixed-price sale is
easy for the buyer to complete. The only problem is that many potential
buyers may lean toward an auction because of the perception that they
may get a better deal.
 Sell in Your eBay Store: Chapter 11 covers eBay Stores — a convenient
place to sell related items to your auctions or fixed-price sales.
 Advertise: If you don’t want to put your property up for auction and
you’d like to correspond with the prospective buyers, this is the option
for you. Although this option originated with real estate, the ad format is
available in many categories. If you’re interested in finding out about
fees, check out his URL:
pages.ebay.com/help/sell/adformatfees.html
Say, for example, that you want to list a good, old-fashioned eBay auction. You
want to sell your item for a fixed price but are willing to let it go to auction.
To find eBay’s Sell Your Item form from the eBay Home page, you can use
either of these methods:
191
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

 Click the Sell link on the navigation bar at the top of the page, and you’re
whisked there immediately. eBay allows you to select your category and
download the Sell Your Item page in seconds.
 You can also start your auction from your My eBay page. Just click the
Sell Similar link (on the All Selling page) next to one of your existing
items. Using the form that appears, you can change the item data.
When listing your item, here’s the info you’re asked to fill out (each of these
items is discussed in detail later in this chapter):
 User ID and Password: You need to sign in again before you begin listing
items for sale.
 Category: The category where you’ve decided to list your item (required).
 Title: The name of your item (required).
 Description: What you want to tell eBay buyers about your item
(required).
 eBay Picture Services or Image URL: The Web address of any pictures
you want to add (optional). To add the URL of image on the Sell Your
Item form, you must click the Customize Form link at the top of the page
and add the option to include a URL (versus using eBay picture serv-
ices). Note that you get a free Preview picture at the top of your auction.
Chapter 14 has more information on using images in your auction.
 The Gallery: You can add your item’s picture to eBay’s photo gallery
(optional). eBay charges $0.35 extra to add the item to the Gallery, $0.75
to have a Gallery image that gets larger when a user drags his or her
mouse over it, and $19.95 to make your item a featured auction in the
Gallery. (You can find more on the Gallery later in this chapter.)
 Gallery Image URL: If you want to include a hosted image, you must
include the Web address of the JPEG image you want to place in the
Gallery (optional). (If you’re using eBay Picture Services, the first photo
you upload is resized for the Gallery.) See Chapter 14.
 Item Location: The region, city, and country from which the item will be
shipped (required).
 Quantity: The number of items you’re offering in this auction is always
one unless you plan to run a Dutch (Multiple Item) auction (required).
 Starting Price: The starting price (sometimes called a minimum bid) you
set (required).
 Duration: The number of days you want the auction to run (required).
 Reserve Price: The hidden target price you set. This is the price that
must be met before this item can be sold (optional). eBay charges you a
fee for this feature.
192
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 Private Auction: You can keep the identity of all bidders secret with this
option (optional). This type of auction is used only in rare circumstances.
 Buy It Now: You can sell your item directly to the first buyer who meets
this price (optional).
 List Item in Two Categories: If you want to double your exposure, you
can list your item in two different categories. Note that double exposure
equals double listing fees (optional).
 Home Page Featured: You can place your auction in a premium viewing
section and have the possibility that your listing will cycle through the
direct links from the front page (optional). eBay charges $39.95 for single
items and $79.95 extra for multiple items for this feature.
 Featured Plus!: You can have your auction appear at the top of the cate-
gory in which you list it (optional). eBay charges $19.95 extra for this
feature.
 Highlight: Your item title is highlighted in the auction listings and search
listings with a lilac-colored band, which may draw eBay members’ eyes
right to your auction (optional). eBay charges $5 extra for this feature.
 Boldface Title: A selling option to make your item listing stand out. eBay
charges $1 extra for this feature (optional).
 Free Counter: If you wish to avail yourself of a free counter, indicate so
here (optional).
 Ship-to-Locations: Here’s where you can indicate where you’re willing to
ship an item. If you don’t want the hassle of shipping out of the United
States, check that option only. You can individually select different coun-
tries as well (optional).
You may want to consider whether you really want to be in the interna-
tional shipping business. Buyers pick up the tab, but you have to deal
with customs forms and post office paperwork. If time is money, you
may want to skip it entirely — or at least have all the forms filled out
before you get in line at the post office. But remember that if you don’t
ship internationally, you’re blocking out a bunch of possible high bid-
ders. Depending on what you’re selling, shipping internationally just
may not be worth the investment in extra time.
 Shipping and Handling Charges: When prospective buyers know the
shipping cost in advance (assuming it’s a realistic price), they’re more
likely to bid or buy right then and there. If they have to e-mail you with
questions, they may find another listing for the same item — with rea-
sonable shipping — and bid or buy that one. Also, if you list the ship-
ping charges on the page, winning bidders can pay you instantly through
PayPal. See information on eBay’s handy shipping calculator, later in this
chapter.
193
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

 Payment Instructions: Here’s the place you put any after-sale informa-
tion. If you don’t want buyers to use Checkout, state that here. If you
want them to pay with a different payment service, mention that as well.
This information appears at the top of your sale when the sale is com-
pleted, at the bottom of the auction while it’s active, and in the End of
Listing e-mail (optional).
 PayPal and Immediate Payment: Fill out this area if you want to require
the high bidder to pay through PayPal immediately when using Buy It
Now. Add the Immediate Payment option if you know the shipping
amount and would like the winner to pay with a click of the mouse
(optional).
 Return Policy: If you are willing to accept returns, indicate it. You can
give the customer as few as three days to return the item (that cuts
down on spurious returns).
Filling in the Required Blanks
Yes, the Sell Your Item form looks daunting, but filling out its many sections
doesn’t take as long as you may think. Some of the questions you’re asked
aren’t things you even have to think about; just click an answer and off you
go. Other questions ask you to type in information. Don’t sweat a thing; all
the answers you need are right here. You can find info on all the required
stuff, and later in this chapter, I talk about optional stuff. After you click your
category, you land on the official Sell Your Item page.
Selecting a category
Many eBay sellers will tell you that selecting the exact category isn’t crucial
to achieving the highest price for your item — and they’re right. The bulk of
buyers (who know what they’re looking for) just input search keywords into
eBay’s search box and look for their items. Potential buyers, though, may
select a category and, just like when you go to the mall, peruse the items for
sale and see if a particular one strikes their fancy.
On the first page of the Sell Your Item form, you need to select the main cate-
gory for your item.
Here’s where your creativity can come into play. Who says that a box of Blue
Dog (the famous doggie icon painted by Cajun artist George Rodrigue) note
cards belongs in Everything Else: Gifts & Occasions: Greeting Cards: Other Cards.
If you look around, you may find a better category. The Find Categories tool
appears the second you open the Sell Your Item page. Just click the associated
194
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

link to browse for categories. Check to see if anyone else is selling the item
(and in which category) or just let this tool help you pick a good category.
Figure 10-1 shows you how easy it is to select a main category.
After you select your main category, you need to select from the thousands
of subcategories. eBay offers you this wealth of choices in a handy point-and-
click way. If you’re unfamiliar with the types of items you can actually find in
those categories, you may want to pore over Chapter 3 before you choose a
category to describe your item. Figure 10-2 shows you how to manually
narrow down the subcategory listings on the Sell Your Item page.
To select a category, here’s the drill:
1. Click one of the main categories.
In the next box, you see a list of subcategories.
2. Select the most appropriate subcategory.
3. Continue selecting subcategories until you have narrowed down your
item listing as much as possible.
You know you’ve come to the last subcategory when you don’t see any
more right-pointing arrows in the Categories.
Figure 10-1:
Let eBay do
some of the
work in

proper
category for
your item.
195
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

Most bidders scan for specific items in subcategories. For example, if you’re
selling a Bakelite fruit pin, don’t just list it under Jewelry; keep narrowing down
your choices. In this case, you can put it in a costume jewelry category that is
especially for Bakelite. I guarantee that the real Bakelite jewelry collectors out
there know where to look to find the jewelry they love. To narrow down the
category of your item, just keep clicking until you hit the end of the line.
Creating the perfect item title
After you figure out what category you want to list in, eBay wants to get
down to the nitty-gritty — what the heck to call that thing you’re trying to
sell.
Think of your item title as a great newspaper headline. The most valuable
real estate on eBay is the 55-character title of your item. The majority of
buyers do title searches, and that’s where your item must come up to be
sold! Give the most essential information right away to grab the eye of the
reader who’s just browsing. Be clear and informative enough to get noticed
by eBay’s search engine. Figure 10-3 shows examples of good titles. Note how
a couple of these titles contain subtitles (more info on subtitles further in this
chapter).
Here are some ideas to help you write your item title:
Figure 10-2:
Narrowing
down your
subcat-
egories.
196
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 Use the most common name for the item.
 If the item is rare, vintage, or hard to find, mention that.
 Mention the item’s condition and whether it’s new or old.
 Mention the item’s special qualities, like its style, model, or edition.
 Avoid fancy punctuation or unusual characters, such as $, hyphens, and
L@@K, because they just clutter up the title — and buyers really don’t
search for them.
When you get into advanced selling mode, you should take a look at one of
my other books, co-authored by Patti Louise Ruby, eBay Listings that Sell For
Dummies. It covers eBay photography and HTML in depth.

Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork
Some subcategories aren’t for everyone
If you’ve chosen to list an item, bid on an item, or
even just browse in the Everything Else: Mature
Audiences category, you need to follow sepa-
rate, specific guidelines because that category
contains graphic nudity or sexual content that
may offend some community members. You
must
 Be at least 18 years of age (but you already
know that all eBay customers must be 18 or
older).
 Have a valid credit card.
 Complete a waiver stating that you’re vol-
untarily choosing to access adults-only
materials. For more on how to do this (and a
handy primer on privacy issues), see
Chapter 15.
If you have Adult/Erotica items that you’d like to
sell in a private auction, study the section later
in this chapter that details the Private Auction
option.

Ordinarily, I don’t throw out French phrases just for the fun of it. But where
making a profit is an issue, I definitely have to agree with the French that
picking or not picking le mot juste can mean the difference between having
potential bidders merely see your auction and having an all-out bidding war
on your hands. Read on for tips about picking the best words to let your list-
ing shine.
Look for a phrase that pays
Here’s a crash course in eBay lingo that can help bring you up to speed on
attracting buyers to your item. The following words are used frequently in
eBay listings, and they can do wonders to jump-start your title:
 Mint
 One of a kind (or OOAK — see the abbreviation list in Table 10-1)
 Vintage
 Collectible
 Rare
 Unique
 Primitive
 Well-loved
There’s a whole science (called grading) to figuring out the value of a col-
lectible. You’re ahead of the game if you have a pretty good idea of what most
eBay members mean. Do your homework before you assign a grade to your
item. If you need more information on what these grades actually mean,
Chapter 5 provides a translation.
eBay lingo at a glance
Common grading terms and the phrases in the preceding section aren’t the
only marketing standards you have at your eBay disposal. As eBay has
grown, so has the lingo that members use as shortcuts to describe their mer-
chandise.
Table 10-1 gives you a handy list of common abbreviations and phrases used
to describe items. (Hint: Mint means “may as well be brand new,” not “cool
chocolate treat attached.”)

NR
No Reserve Price
A reserve price is the price you
can set when you begin your
auction. If bids don’t meet the
reserve, you don’t have to sell.
Many buyers don’t like reserve
prices because they don’t think
that they can get a bargain. (For
tips on how to allay these fears
and get those bids in reserve-
price auctions, see “Writing your
description” later in this chapter.)
If you’re not listing a reserve for
your item, let bidders know.
HTF, OOP
Hard to Find, Out of Print
Out of print, only a few ever
made, or people grabbed up all
there were. (HTF doesn’t mean
you spent a week looking for it in
the attic.)

Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

Often, you can rely on eBay slang to get your point across, but make sure that
you mean it and that you’re using it accurately. Don’t label something MIB
(Mint in Box) when it looks like it’s been Mashed in Box by a meat grinder.
You can find more abbreviations on my Web site, www.coolebaytools.com.
Don’t let your title ruin your auction
Imagine going to a supermarket and asking someone to show you where the
stringy stuff that you boil is instead of asking where the spaghetti is. You
might end up with mung bean sprouts — delicious to some but hardly what
you had in mind. That’s why you should check and recheck your spelling.
Savvy buyers use the eBay search engine to find merchandise; if the name of
your item is spelled wrong, the search engine can’t find it. Poor spelling and
incomprehensible grammar also reflect badly on you. If you’re in competition
with another seller, the buyer is likelier to trust the seller hoo nose gud speling.
If you’ve finished writing your item title and you have spaces left over, please
fight the urge to dress it up with lots of exclamation points and asterisks!!!!!!!!!!!
(See how annoying that is?) No matter how gung-ho you are about your item,
the eBay search engine may overlook your item if the title is encrusted with
meaningless **** and !!!! symbols. If bidders do see your title, they may
become annoyed by the virtual shrillness and ignore it anyway!!!!!!!! (It’s even
more annoying the second time around.)
Another distracting habit is overdoing capital letters. To buyers, seeing
everything in caps is LIKE SEEING A CRAZED SALESMAN SCREAMING AT
THEM TO BUY NOW! Using all caps is considered shouting, which is rude and
tough on the eyes. Use capitalization SPARINGLY, and only to finesse a partic-
ular point.
Giving the title punch with a subtitle
A new feature at eBay is the availability of subtitles. eBay allows you to buy an
additional 55 characters, which will appear under your item title in a search.
The fee for this extra promotion is $0.50, and in a few circumstances, it is defi-
nitely worth your while. Any text that you input will really make your item
stand out in the crowd — but (you knew there would be a but didn’t you?)
these additional 55 characters won’t come up in a title search. In other words,
if the subtitle includes essential information (“NR MIMB,” for example) that
isn’t in the main title, people searching for NR MIMB won’t find your listing. So
if you have all those words in your description, the words will be found either
way with a title and description search. If you choose this option, pick atten-
tion-getting info that isn’t absolutely needed for the title itself.
200
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Writing your description
After you hook potential bidders with your title, reel ’em in with a fabulous
description. Don’t think Hemingway here; think infomercial (the classier the
better). Figure 10-4 shows a great description of some silver dollars. You can
write a magnificent description, as well — all you have to do is click in the
box and start typing.
Here’s a list of suggestions for writing an item description:
 Accentuate the positive. Give the buyer a reason to buy your item and
be enthusiastic when you list all the reasons everyone should bid on it.
Unlike the title, you can use as much space as you want. Even if you use
a photo, be precise in your description — how big it is, what color, what
kind of fabric, what design, and so on. Refer to “Creating the perfect item
title” earlier in this chapter, as well as Table 10-1, for ideas on what to
emphasize and how to word your description.
 Include the negative. Don’t hide the truth of your item’s condition.
Trying to conceal flaws costs you in the long run: You’ll get tagged 
with bad feedback. If the item has a scratch, a nick, a dent, a crack, a
ding, a tear, a rip, missing pieces, replacement parts, faded color, dirty
smudges, or a bad smell (especially if cleaning might damage the item),
mention it in the description. If your item has been overhauled, rebuilt, 
Figure 10-4:

the
difference
between
success
and failure.
201
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

repainted, or hot-rodded (say, a “Pentium computer” that was a 386 till
you put in the new motherboard), say so. You don’t want the buyer to
send back your merchandise because you weren’t truthful about imper-
fections or modifications. This type of omission can lead to a fraud
investigation.
 Be precise about all the logistical details of the post-auction transac-
tion. Even though you’re not required to list any special S&H (shipping
and handling) or payment requirements in your item description, the
majority of eBay users do. Try to figure out the cost of shipping the item
in the United States and add that to your description. If you offer ship-
ping insurance, add it to your item description.
 While you’re at it, promote yourself too. As you accumulate positive
feedback, tell potential bidders about your terrific track record. Add
statements like “I’m great to deal with. Check out my feedback section.”
You can even take it a step further by inviting prospective bidders to
your About Me page (where you may also include a link to your personal
Web site — if you have one). (Chapter 14 gives you some tips on how to
make your auction seen by a wider audience.)
 Wish your potential bidders well. Communication is the key to a good
transaction, and you can set the tone for your auction and post-auction
exchanges by including some simple phrases that show your friendly
side. Always end your description by wishing bidders good luck, inviting
potential bidders to e-mail you with questions, and offering the option of
providing additional photos of the item if you have them.
When you input your description, you have the option of jazzing things up
with a bit of HTML coding, or you can use eBay’s HTML text editor, shown in
Figure 10-5. If you know how to use a word processor, you’ll have no trouble
touching up your text with this tool. Table 10-2 shows you a few additional
codes to help you pretty things up.
You can go back and forth from the HTML text editor to the regular input and
add additional codes here and there by clicking from the Standard form to
the HTML entry form tabs. I often prepare all my auctions ahead of time and
save them in my computer as plain HTML files — that way they’re always
retrievable for use (I just copy and paste) — no matter what program or form
I’m using to list my auctions. See Chapter 20 for more on software to help you
with your auctions.

Occasionally, sellers offer an item as a presell, or an item that the seller doesn’t
yet have in stock but expects to. If you’re offering this kind of item, make sure
that you spell out all the details in the description. eBay policy states that
you must ship a presell item within 30 days of the auction’s end, so be sure
you will have the item within that time span. Don’t forget to include the
actual shipping date. I have found that putting an item up for sale without
actually having it in hand is a practice fraught with risk. The item you’re
expecting may not arrive in time or arrive damaged. I’ve heard of one too
many sellers who have had to go out and purchase an item at retail for a
buyer in order to preserve their feedback when caught in this situation.
Listing the number of items for sale
Unless you’re planning on holding a Multiple Item listing or Dutch auction,
the number of items is always 1, which means you’re holding a traditional
auction or listing a single item up for sale. If you need to change the quantity
number from 1, just type the number in the box.
A matching set of cuff links is considered one item, as is the complete 37-
volume set of The Smith Family Ancestry and Genealogical History since 1270.
If you have more than one of the same item (two sets of cuff links), I suggest
that you sell them one at a time. You are much more likely to get higher final
bids for your items when you sell them individually. Never try to sell items
that belong in a set as separate items.
Whether you list your items individually in auctions or together in a Multiple
Item auction, eBay won’t allow you to list the same item in more than 15 auc-
tions at one time.
204
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Setting a starting price — 
how low can you go?
What do a baseball autographed by JFK, a used walkie-talkie, and a Jaguar
sports car all have in common? They all started with a $1 starting price. eBay
requires you to set a starting price, also called a minimum bid — the lowest
bid allowed in an auction. You may be surprised to see stuff worth tens of
thousands of dollars starting at just a buck. These sellers haven’t lost their
minds. Neither are they worried someone could be tooling down the highway
in a $100,000 sports car they bought for the price of a burger.
Setting an incredibly low minimum (just type it in the box without the dollar
sign but with the decimal point) is a subtle strategy that gives you more bang
for your buck. You can use a low starting price to attract more bidders who
will, in turn, drive up the price to the item’s real value — especially if, after
doing your research, you know that the item is particularly hot.
If you’re worried about the outcome of the final bid, you can protect your item
by using a reserve price (the price the bidding needs to reach before the item
can be sold). Then you won’t have to sell your item for a bargain-basement
price because your reserve price protects your investment. The best advice
is to set a reserve price that is the lowest amount you’ll take for your item
and then set a minimum bid that is ridiculously low. Use a reserve only when
absolutely necessary because some bidders pass up reserve auctions. (For
more info about setting a reserve price, see the section “Your secret safety
net — reserve price,” later in this chapter.)

Going Dutch
If you’ve got five Barbie Wedding Day Dolls, 37
Breathalyzers, or 2,000 commemorative pins,
and you want to sell them all at once to as many
bidders as quickly as possible, sell them as mul-
tiple quantities in a fixed-price sale. (You can
also sell the whole shebang in one lot in the
Wholesale Lot category.) If you’re not sure how
much you can get for the items, you can always
try a Dutch (Multiple Item) auction. Dutch auc-
tions are mainly used by dealers and busi-
nesses that want to move lots of items fast.
eBay has requirements for starting a Dutch
auction. You have to be an eBay member at
least 14 days with a feedback rating of 30 or
higher or go through ID Verify. Click the ?
bubble next to the Quantity field on the Sell Your
Item page for more information on how to con-
duct this type of auction, and check out Chapter
1 for more info on how a Dutch auction works.
If you’re interested in bidding on a Dutch auc-
tion, take a look at Chapter 6.

Starting with a low starting price is also good for your pocketbook. eBay
charges the seller an Insertion fee — based on your opening bid. If you keep
your opening bid low and set no reserve, you get to keep more of your
money. (See Chapter 9 for more about eBay fees.)
The more bids you get, the more people who will want to bid on your item
because they perceive the item as hot. A hot item with lots of bids draws
even more bidders the way a magnet attracts paper clips.
Before you set any starting price, do your homework and make some savvy
marketing decisions. If your auction isn’t going as you hoped, you could end up
selling Grandma Ethel’s Ming vase for a dollar. Think about your strategy. See
“Mid-Course Corrections: Fixing Current Auctions” later in this chapter on how
you can make changes in your listing if you’ve made some egregious error.
When entering a starting price, type in only the numbers and a decimal point.
Don’t use dollar signs ($) or cents signs (¢).
Buy It Now
eBay’s Buy It Now (BIN in eBay-speak) is available for single-item auctions.
This feature allows buyers who want to purchase an item now to do so. Have
you ever wanted an item really badly and didn’t want to wait until the end of
an auction? If the seller offers Buy It Now, you can purchase that item imme-
diately. If you’re the seller, you can entice your bidders to pay just a tad more
to have the satisfaction of walking away with the item free and clear. Just
specify the amount the item can sell for in the Buy It Now price area — the
amount can be whatever you wish. If you choose to take advantage of selling
a hot item, for example, during the holiday rush, you can make the BIN price
as high as you think it can go. If you just want the item to move, make your
BIN price the average price you see the item go for at eBay.
When your item receives a bid, the BIN option disappears, and the item goes
through the normal auction process. If you have a reserve price on your item,
the BIN feature doesn’t disappear until a bidder meets your reserve price
through the normal bidding process. To list an item with Buy It Now, you
must have a feedback of 10 or be ID Verified. (See Chapter 16 for more details
on ID Verify.)
Setting your auction time
How long do you want to run your auction? eBay gives you a choice — 1, 3, 5,
7, or 10 days. Just click the number you want in the box. If you choose a 10-
day auction, you add $0.40 to your listing fee.
206
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

My auction-length strategy depends on the time of year and the item I’m sell-
ing, and I generally have great success. If you have an item that you think will
sell pretty well, run a 7-day auction (be sure it will cover a full weekend) so
bidders have time to check it out before they decide to bid. However, if you
know that you’ve got a red-hot item that’s going to fly off the shelves — like a
rare toy or a hard-to-get video game — choose a 3-day auction. Eager bidders
tend to bid higher and more often to beat out their competition if the item is
hot and going fast. Three days is long enough to give trendy items exposure
and ring up bids.
No matter how many days you choose to run your auction, it ends at exactly
the same time of day as it starts. A 7-day auction that starts on Thursday at
9:03:02 a.m. ends the following Thursday at 9:03:02 a.m.
Although I know the gang at eBay is a pretty laid back group, they do run on
military time. That means they use a 24-hour clock that’s set to Pacific Time. So
3:30 in the afternoon is 15:30, and one minute after midnight is 00:01. Questions
about time conversions? Check out www.timezoneconverter.com or look at
the table on my Web site in the Tools area, which has a printable conversion
chart of eBay times (www.coolebaytools.com). (And so you don’t have to
keep flipping back to this page, I also include these handy-dandy links on the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.)
With auctions running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you should know when
the most bidders are around to take a gander at your wares. Here are some
times to think about:
 Saturday/Sunday: Always run an auction over a weekend. People log on
and off of eBay all day.
Don’t start or end your auction on a Saturday or Sunday — unless your
completed auction research indicates that you should. Certain types of
bidders love sitting at their computers waiting for auctions to end on the
weekends, but many bidders are busy having lives, and their schedules
are unpredictable. Although a few eager bidders may log on and place a
maximum bid on your auction, you can bet that they won’t be sitting at a
computer making a last-minute flurry of competitive bids if they have
something better to do on a Saturday or Sunday.
 Holiday weekends: If a holiday weekend’s coming up around the time
you’re setting up your auction, run your auction through the weekend
and end it a day after the “holiday” Monday. This gives prospective bid-
ders a chance to catch up with the items they perused over the weekend
and plan their bidding strategies.
Don’t end an auction on the last day of a three-day holiday. People in the
mood to shop are generally at department stores collecting bargains. If
eBay members aren’t shopping, they’re out enjoying an extra day off.
 Time of day: The best times of day to start and end your auction are
during eBay’s peak hours of operation, which are 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
207
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

Pacific Time, right after work on the West Coast. Perform your completed
auction research, however, to be sure that this strategy applies to your
item. Your timing depends on the item you’re listing and whether 5:00
p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time is the middle of the night where you live.
Unless you’re an insomniac or a vampire and want to sell to werewolves, don’t
let your auctions close in the middle of the night, at 02:30. Not enough bidders
are around to cause any last-minute bidding that would bump up the price.
Your secret safety net — reserve price
Here’s a little secret: The reason sellers list big-ticket items like Ferraris,
grand pianos, and high-tech computer equipment with a starting bid of $1 
is because they’re protected from losing money with a reserve price. The
reserve price is the lowest price that must be met before the item can be
sold. It’s not required by eBay but can protect you. eBay charges an addi-
tional fee for this feature that varies depending on how high your reserve is.
For example, say you list a first edition book of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of
Wrath. You set the starting price at $1, and you set a reserve price at $80. That
means that people can start bidding at $1, and if at the end of the auction the
bidding hasn’t reached the $80 reserve, you don’t have to sell the book.
As with everything in life, using a reserve price for your auctions has an
upside and a downside. Many choosy bidders and bargain hunters blast past
reserve-price auctions because they see a reserve price as a sign that pro-
claims “No bargains here!” Many bidders figure they can get a better deal on
the same item with an auction that proudly declares NR (for no reserve) in its
description. As an enticement to those bidders, you see lots of NR listings in
auction titles.
If you need to set a reserve on your item, help the bidder out. Many bidders shy
away from an auction that has a reserve, but if they’re really interested, they will
read the item description. To dispel their fears that the item is way too expen-
sive or out of their price range, add a line in your description that states the
amount of your reserve price. “I have put a reserve of $75 on this item to pro-
tect my investment; the highest bid over $75 will win the item.” A phrase such
as this takes away the vagueness of the reserve auction and allows you to place
a reserve with a low opening bid. (You want to reel ’em in, remember?)
On lower-priced items, I suggest that you set a higher starting price and set
no reserve. Otherwise, if you’re not sure about the market, set a low mini-
mum bid but set a high reserve to protect yourself.
208
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

If bids don’t reach a set reserve price, some sellers e-mail the highest bidder
and offer the item at what the seller thinks is a fair price. Sending a Second
Chance offer through the eBay system makes much more sense. Two caveats
if you try to circumvent eBay fees and contact the bidders:
 eBay can suspend the seller and the buyer if the side deal is reported to
Trust & Safety. This activity is strictly prohibited.
 eBay won’t protect buyers or sellers if a side deal goes bad.
You can’t use a reserve price in a Multiple Item (Dutch) auction.
I want to be alone: The private auction
In a private auction, bidders’ User IDs are kept under wraps. Sellers typically
use this option to protect the identities of bidders during auctions for high-
priced big-ticket items (say, that restored World War II fighter). Wealthy eBay
users may not want the world to know that they have the resources to buy
expensive items. Private auctions are also held for items from the Adult/Erotica
category. (Gee, there’s a shocker.)
The famous sign that was pictured in almost every Disneyland promotion (for
the first 40 or so years of Disneyland’s existence) was put up for sale on eBay
in 2000. Legend has it that the sign was purchased by actor John Stamos for a
high bid of $30,700. Unfortunately for John, the Disney auctions did not use
the private auction feature. After news of the winner’s name hit the tabloids —
the entire world knew John’s eBay User ID! He had to change his ID in a hurry
to end the throngs of lovey-dovey e-mail headed to his computer!
In private auctions, the seller’s e-mail address is accessible to bidders in case
questions arise. Bidders’ e-mail addresses remain unseen.
Put me in the Gallery
The Gallery is a visually graphic auction area that lets you post pictures 
to a special photo gallery that’s accessible from the listings. It also causes 
a postage-stamp-size version of your image to appear next to your listing in
the category or search. Many buyers enjoy browsing the Gallery catalog-
style, and it’s open to all categories. If you choose to go this route, your item
is listed in both the Gallery and in the regular text listings. (I explain how to
post your pictures in Chapter 14.)
209
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

The best thing about using a Gallery picture in your listings is that it increases
the space your listing takes up on a search or category page. If you don’t use
a Gallery picture and just have an image in your auction, all that will be next
to your listing is a teeny, tiny camera icon.
Filling out the item location
eBay wants you to list the general area and the country in which you live.
The idea behind telling the bidder where you live is to give him or her a
heads-up on what kind of shipping charges to expect. Don’t be esoteric (list-
ing where you live as The Here and Now isn’t a whole lot of help) but don’t go
crazy with cross-streets, landmarks, or degrees of latitude. Listing the city
and state you live in is enough.
If you live in a big area — say, suburban Los Angeles (who, me?), which
sprawls on for miles — you may want to think about narrowing down your
region a little. You may find a bidder who lives close to you, which could
swing your auction. If you do a face-to-face transaction, doing it in a public
place is a good idea. (I like doing my trades at Starbucks.)
A picture is worth a thousand words
Clichés again? Perhaps. But an item on eBay without a picture is almost a waste
of time. If you haven’t set up photo hosting elsewhere, you can list one picture
with eBay’s Pictures Service for free. Additional ones cost you $0.15 each.
Alternatively, you can put all the pictures you want in your auction descrip-
tion for free. See Chapter 14 for the necessary coding and instructions.
Listing Designer
How many times have you seen an item on eBay laid out on the page all
pretty-like with a fancy border around the description? If that sort of thing
appeals to you, eBay’s Listing Designer will supply you with pretty borders for
almost any type of item for $0.10. Selecting your design is as easy as clicking
the menu (see Figure 10-6). You can designate where you’d like to place your
image on the page relative to the description (left, right, top, or bottom).
Will the pretty borders increase the amount of bids your auction will get? It’s
doubtful. A clean item description with a couple of good clear pictures of
your item is really all you need.
210
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

There’s a newly available combination deal called the Value Pack. For $0.65,
you can place a subtitle on your listing, add a Gallery picture, and doll things
up with Listing Designer. All those features would normally cost $0.95, so the
savings is clear if you run several auctions a week.
If you don’t want to use the Listing Designer graphics to distract from your
item, you can still get a discount. Just click the Enhance Description check-
box, but don’t select a graphic pattern. You’ll still saving $0.30 over the price
of a subtitle and Gallery (sneaky, huh?).
Listing the payment methods you’ll accept
Yeah, sure, eBay is loads of fun, but the bottom line to selling is the phrase
“Show me the money!” You make the call on what you’re willing to take as
money from the high bidder of your auction. eBay offers the following pay-
ment options — just select the ones that you like:
 Money Order/Cashier’s Check: From a seller’s point of view, this is the
safest method of payment. It’s the closest thing you can get to cash. As a
seller, you want to get paid with as little risk as possible. The only draw-
back? You have to wait for the buyer to mail it.
 Credit Cards: If you accept credit cards, using PayPal is the cheapest
and most convenient way to go. If you have a merchant account through
a retail store, be sure to select the little checkboxes next to the credit
cards you accept.
Offering a credit card payment option through PayPal or a Merchant
account often attracts higher bids to your auctions. These higher bids
usually more than cover the small percentage that credit card payment
services charge you to use their services. See Chapter 8 for a more com-
plete description on how to use these services.

Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

Some sellers who use credit card services try attaching an additional 
fee (to cover their credit card processing fees) to the final payment.
However, that’s against the law in California, home of eBay, and therefore
against eBay’s rules. So forget about it. eBay can end your auction if it
catches you.
 C.O.D. (Cash on Delivery): I think that this option is the least attractive
for both buyers and sellers. The buyer has to be home with the cash
ready to go on the day that the package arrives. Odds are that on the
day the item’s delivered, your buyer is taking his or her sick pet goldfish
to the vet for a gill-cleaning. Then the item ends up back at your door,
and you have no sale. It also often takes up to 30 days for you to get the
money back in your hands.
 See Item Description: I think you should always state in your item
description how you want to be paid. Why? Because there’s no good
reason not to and it takes away the mystery of shopping with you. If
you’re offering payment options that aren’t listed here, select this
option. Some buyers (mostly international) like to pay in cash, but I
think this is way too risky and recommend that you never, ever deal in
cash. If a problem arises — for either buyer or seller — no one has evi-
dence that payment was made or received. Avoid it. In fact, soliciting a
cash payment is against the eBay rules unless you’re doing a local
pickup.
 Personal Check: This is an extremely popular option, but it comes with 
a risk: The check could bounce higher than a lob at Wimbledon. If you
accept personal checks, explain in your item description how long you
plan to wait for the check to clear before sending the merchandise. The
average hold is about ten business days. Some sellers wait as long as two
full weeks. Accepting eChecks through PayPal leaves all the bookkeeping
and waiting to PayPal; you don’t have to call the bank for confirmation.
Cut down on the risk of bad checks by reading the bidder’s feedback when
the auction’s underway. Be wary of accepting checks from people with
negative comments. (I explain all about feedback in Chapter 4.) Never ship
an item until you’re certain the check has cleared the buyer’s bank.
eBay is trying to take some of the mystery and foreboding out of accept-
ing checks with its ID Verify program, which allows VeriSign, a gigantic
check-verification company, to run credit checks and present eBay mem-
bers with a clean bill of health. A member who is ID Verified is usually a
good bet to accept a check from. (For more on ID Verify, see Chapter 16.)
Most sellers offer buyers several ways to pay. You can choose as few or as
many as you want. When the item page appears, your choices are noted at
the top of the listing. Listing several payment options makes you look like a
flexible, easygoing professional.
212
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Setting shipping terms
Ahoy, matey! Hoist the bid! Okay, not quite. Before you run it up the mast,
select your shipping options. Here are your choices:
 Ship to the United States Only: This option is selected by default; it
means you only ship domestically.
 Will Ship Worldwide: The world is your oyster. But make sure that you
can afford the time for the extra processing of customs forms.
 Will Ship to United States and the Following: If you’re comfortable
shipping to certain countries but not to others, make your selections
here, and they show up on your auction page.
When you indicate that you will ship internationally, your auction shows up
on the international eBay sites, which is a fantastic way to attract new buyers!
eBay has lots of good international users, so you may want to consider sell-
ing your items around the world. If you do, be sure to clearly state in the
description all extra shipping costs and customs charges. (See Chapter 12 for
more information on how to ship to customers abroad.)
Traditionally, the buyer pays for shipping, and this is the point at which you
must decide how much to charge. You also have to calculate how much this
item will cost you to ship. If it’s a small item (weighing under a pound or so),
you may decide to charge a flat rate to all buyers. To charge a flat rate, click
the Flat Shipping Rates tab and fill in the shipping amount. Before you fill in
the amount, be sure to include your charges for packing (see Chapter 12 for
more info on how much to add for this task) and how much the insurance
charges will be.
If your item weighs 2 pounds or more, you may want to use eBay’s versatile
shipping calculator. Because UPS and the U.S. Postal Service now charge vari-
able rates for packages of the same weight, based on distance, using the cal-
culator simplifies things for your customers (and you). Be sure you’ve weighed
the item and know how much your handling charge will be. The calculator
allows you to input a handling amount and adds it to the overall shipping
total, but does not break out the amount separately for the customer. The cal-
culator also conveniently calculates the proper insurance amount for the
item. Figure 10-7 shows how simple the form is.
The calculator automatically appears on the item page so that prospective
buyers can type in their zip code and immediately know how much shipping
will be to their location.
Check out Chapter 12 for more information on shipping options.

Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

eBay Options: Ballyhoo on the Cheap
Although eBay’s display options aren’t quite as effective as a three-story neon
sign in Times Square, they do bring greater attention to your auction. Here are
your options:
 Bold: eBay fee: $1. Bold type does catch your attention but don’t bother
using it on items that’ll bring in less than $25. Do use it if you’re in hot
competition with similar items and you want yours to stand out.
 Highlight: eBay fee: $5. Yellow highlighter is what I use to point out the high
points in books I read. (You’re using one now, aren’t you?) The eBay high-
light feature is lilac, but it can really make your item shine. Check out the
category in which you choose to list before selecting this feature. Some
categories are overwhelmed with sellers using the highlight option, and the
pages look completely shaded in lilac. In these categories, not using highlight
(and using perhaps a bold title instead) makes your auction stand out more.
 Home Page Featured: eBay fee: $39.95 ($79.95 for Multiple Item listings).
As with expensive real estate, you pay a premium for location, location,
location. The $39.95 gives you the highest level of visibility at eBay, and it
occasionally appears smack dab in the middle of the eBay home page
(although there’s no guarantee that it will). Figure 10-8 shows the featured
auctions on eBay’s home page.

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Buyers do browse the Featured Items to see what’s there, just as you
might head directly to the New Releases section of your video store. But,
because the vast majority of items found on eBay are under $25, the
average seller doesn’t use the Featured Items option.
 Featured Plus! eBay fee: $19.95. You want top billing? You can buy it
here. This option puts you on the first page of your item category and
on search results pages. This is a good option for moving special mer-
chandise. Often, bidders just scan the top items; if you want to be seen,
you gotta be there. eBay’s statistics say that items listed as Featured
Plus! are 58 percent more likely to sell — but it really depends on what
you’re selling and when. Ask yourself this: Is it worth $20 to have more
people see my item? If yes, then go for it. Figure 10-9 shows how items
are listed in the Featured Plus! listings.
You need a feedback rating of at least 10 to make it to the Featured Items
and Featured Plus! auctions.
Checking Your Work and 
Starting the Auction
After you’ve filled in all the blanks on the Sell Your Item form and you think
you’re ready to join the world of e-commerce, follow these steps:
1. Click the Review button at the bottom of the Sell Your Item page.
You waft to the Verification page (shown in Figure 10-10), the place where
you can catch mistakes before your item is listed. The Verification page
shows you a condensed version of all your information and tallies up how
much eBay is charging you in fees and options to run this auction. You also
see a preview of how your description and pictures will look on the site.

215
Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

You also may find the Verification page helpful as a last-minute chance
to get your bearings. If you’ve chosen a very general category, eBay asks
you whether you’re certain there isn’t a more appropriate category. You
can go back to any of the pages that need correcting by clicking the Edit
Listings links on the Verification page. Make category changes or any
other changes and additions, and then head for the Verification page
again.
2. Check for mistakes.
Nit-pick for common, careless errors; you won’t be sorry. I’ve seen eBay
members make goofs such as the wrong category listing, spelling and
grammatical errors, and missing information about shipping, handling,
insurance, and payment methods.
3. When you’re sure everything’s accurate and you’re happy with your
item listing, click the Submit My Listing button.
A Confirmation page pops up from eBay. At that precise moment, your
listing begins, even though it may be a couple of hours before it appears
in eBay’s search and listings updates. If you want to see your auction
right away and check for bids, your Confirmation page provides a link
for that purpose. Click the link, and you’re there. You can also keep track
of your auctions by using the My eBay page. (To find out how, see
Chapter 4.)

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

All auction pages come with this friendly warning: Seller assumes all
responsibility for listing this item. You should contact
the seller to resolve any questions before bidding.
Some eBay veterans just gloss over this warning after they’ve been wheeling
and dealing for a while, but it’s an important rule to remember. See Chapter 9
for details on the rules sellers must follow and Chapter 12 for tips on your
role in closing the deal and receiving good feedback.
For the first 24 hours after your sale is underway, eBay stamps the Item page
with a funky sunrise icon next to the listing. This is just a little reminder for
buyers to come take a look at the latest items up for sale.
Mid-Course Corrections: 
Fixing Current Auctions
Don’t worry if you make a mistake filling out the Sell Your Item page but don’t
notice it until after the auction is up and running. Pencils have erasers, and
eBay allows revisions. You can make changes at two stages of the game:

check for
errors

Chapter 10: Time to Sell: Completing the Cyber Paperwork

before the first bid is placed and after the bidding war is underway. The fol-
lowing sections explain what you can (and can’t) correct — and when you
have to accept the little imperfections of your Auction Item page.
Making changes before bidding begins
Here’s what you can change about your listing before bids have been placed
(and when it does not end within 12 hours):
 The title or description of your auction
 The item category
 The item’s starting price
 The item’s Buy It Now price
 The reserve price (you can add, change, or remove it)
 The duration of your listing
 The URL of the picture you’re including with your auction
 A private listing designation (you can add or remove it)
 Accepted payment methods, checkout information, item location, and
shipping terms
When you revise an auction, eBay puts a little notation on your auction page
that reads: Description(revised). (Think of it as automatic common
courtesy.)
To revise a fixed-price listing or any auction before bids have been received,
follow these steps:
1. Go to the auction page and click the Revise Your Item link.
This link will only appear if you’ve Signed In to eBay. If the item hasn’t
received any bids, a message appears on your screen to indicate that
you may update the item.
If you’re already signed in, you go directly to the Revise Item page.
2. You arrive at the Revise Item page which looks like the Sell Your Item
form.
3. Make changes to the item information and then click the Save and
Continue button at the bottom of the page when you’re finished.
A summary of your newly revised auction page appears on your screen.
218
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

4. If you’re happy with your revisions, click the Save Changes.
If not, click the Back button of your browser and redo the Update Your
Information page.
You’re taken to your newly revised item page, where you see a disclaimer
from eBay that says you’ve revised the listing before the first bid.
Making changes after bidding begins
If your listing is up and running and already receiving bids, you can still make
some slight modifications to it. Newly added information is clearly separated
from the original text and pictures. In addition, eBay puts a time stamp on the
additional info in case questions from early bidders crop up later.
After your item receives bids, eBay allows you to add to your item’s descrip-
tion. If you feel you were at a loss for words in writing your item’s description,
if you discover new information (that vase you thought was a reproduction is
actually the real thing!), or if a lot of potential bidders are asking the same
questions, go ahead and make all the additions you want. But whatever you
put there the first time around stays in the description as well.
Don’t let an oversight grow into a failure to communicate and don’t ignore iffy
communication until the auction is over. Correct any inaccuracies in your
auction information now to avoid problems later on.
Always check your e-mail to see whether bidders have questions about your
item. If a bidder wants to know about flaws, be truthful and courteous when
returning e-mails. As you get more familiar with eBay (and with writing auc-
tion descriptions), the number of e-mail questions will decrease. If you enjoy
good customer service in your day-to-day shopping, here’s your chance to
give some back.

S
ometimes you just don’t wanna buy in an auction. Sometimes you want
to buy your item now. No waiting for an auction to end — now! The easi-
est place to go for this type of transaction is the eBay Express site or the
eBay Stores area, where you find fixed-price items for sale. Visiting the stores
can save you money — because buying from one seller allows several items
to be shipped in the same box. Many sellers will combine shipping costs on
multiple purchases.
All the fine merchandise that you can find on eBay can also be found in the
eBay Stores area. eBay Stores is located in a separate area from the regular
auctions, and regular eBay sellers run these stores. eBay Stores is a place
where sellers can list as many additional items for sale as they’d like for a
reduced Insertion Fee. Buyers are lured to the store by the small red eBay
Stores icon that appears next to the seller’s User ID.
Whenever you’re looking at an item, and you see that the seller has a store,
be sure to click the store icon. The seller may have the very same merchan-
dise in his or her eBay store for a lower buy price.
If a seller has an eBay store, he or she can list individual items for different
sizes of an article of clothing, different variations of items that he or she sells
in regular auctions, or anything that falls within eBay’s listing policies. The
store items have a listing time of at least 30 days, so sellers can also put up
specialty items that may not sell well in a short auction term of only one to
ten days.

The requirements to open an eBay store are pretty basic. I suggest that you
transact business on the site for quite a while before you open a store. You
need to have a solid understanding of how eBay works and know how to
handle all types of transactions. These are eBay’s requirements:
 You must be registered as an eBay seller, with a credit card on file.
 You must have a feedback rating or 20 or more (or be ID Verified).
 You must accept credit card payments, either through PayPal or through
a merchant account.
The eBay search engine does not directly search the eBay Stores area. If you
perform a search on eBay, be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to see
whether the particular item is available in an eBay store. Store inventory list-
ings appear in the search results when there are 30 or fewer listings for the
item on the core eBay site.
To get to the eBay Stores main area, visit the eBay home page, look for the
Specialty Sites link on the upper-left corner (see Figure 11-1), and click the
eBay Stores link. Alternatively, you can type www.ebaystores.com in the
address box of your Web browser.

Unlimited Shopping from the Stores Page
Okay, you’ve arrived! You’ve come to the hub of power shopping online, the
eBay Stores home page (see Figure 11-2). Just like the eBay home page, this is
your gateway to many incredible bargains. In this section, you find out what
you can expect to find in eBay’s stores, how to navigate the stores, and how
to find the deals.
Conducting an eBay Stores search
On the top-left of the eBay Stores home page is the search engine for eBay
Stores. The store search link is also available by clicking the Buy button in
the navigation bar. (There’s a search box on the resulting page; just below it
is an eBay Stores Search link.) You can perform your search in eBay stores on
different levels. You can search for Buy It Now items — seems a tad bit too
obvious for me, isn’t that why we’re here? Anyway, if you type your keyword
in the box and stay with the default search, you can find every piece of the
fixed-price inventory in the stores that matches your keyword.

223
Chapter 11: Forget the Car — Drive Your Mouse to an eBay Store

eBay Stores don’t just list the fixed-price items. If sellers have current auc-
tions on eBay, those auctions are listed in their stores as well — only regular
auctions won’t come up in an eBay Stores item search. So if you find an auc-
tion that interests you at eBay, click the item to read the description and the
condition of the item. If you want to buy the item, then click the Visit My
eBay Store link next to the store name on the top of the item page to go to the
seller’s eBay store. You just may find some related items that you want. And
the seller probably combines shipping so that you save some money!
If you remember a particular seller’s store name (or part of it), you can also
search eBay Stores by store name. All you have to do is type the store name
(or part of the store name), as shown in Figure 11-3 in the Search Stores box
and select the Search Store Name and Description option button.
If you can’t remember the store name, but you can remember what it sells,
type the keywords in the search box while selecting the Stores with Matching
Items option. For example, you can search for terrier t-shirts. If the seller has
used those words in his or her store description or title, it shows up in the
search results listing. In Figure 11-4, I just typed the name of one of my books
and was transported to my own store.
Browsing the store categories
Browsing store categories is a great idea when you’re looking for a specialist —
you know, someone who carries a particular type of item that appeals to you.
Perhaps you have an affinity for jewelry, art, limited edition books, or needle-
point. Whatever your interest, you’ll probably find a store here to suit your
needs.
Figure 11-3:
Finding a

224
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

To browse eBay Stores, just click Buy in the navigation bar on any eBay page.
Near the very bottom of the page on the bottom link area, click the Browse
Stores link, and you travel to the eBay Stores hub. Look for a list of categories
on the left side of page; click a category that suits your fancy. When you do
that, the left side of the page (surprise!) lists subcategories within that cate-
gory. I clicked the category Coins and then the subcategory U.S. Coins, and
got the subcategory hub page.
Browsing eBay Stores categories is like strolling down a mall filled with your
favorite items. Note that stores with the highest inventories in the category
are listed toward the top.
Just like in the brick-and-mortar world, more “general” stores at eBay carry a
wide breadth of merchandise. By browsing individual categories, you may be
missing them. Try visiting the Everything Else category, and you’ll find, well,
everything else.
Selling from Your Own Virtual Storefront
After you’ve shopped the eBay Stores, you may be thinking that this is a good
place to open your own store. There’s great news on that end because eBay
Stores have the most reasonable rent on the Internet. At an eBay Store, you are
not constrained by the auction format of a one-to-ten-day maximum. You can
list your fixed-price items in your eBay store on a “good till cancelled” basis.

Chapter 11: Forget the Car — Drive Your Mouse to an eBay Store

I don’t like to pull punches with my readers, so let me give you a bit of
advice. Opening an eBay store without a large stock of items, or many items
that you stock in multiples, makes no sense. Opening an eBay store is really
for true sellers — those who make a business on the eBay site selling mer-
chandise they’ve bought for the purpose of reselling. Retailers who come to
the eBay site to expand their business can be successful with the stores, but
certainly it helps to know the e-commerce ropes already.
Too many readers (new to eBay) e-mail me after reading this book and tell me
that they opened a store and have had no sales. You must sell buckets of items
on eBay in the auction format to draw people to your store — simple as that.
Paying the landlord
Monthly rent for an eBay store is as low as $15.95 per month. Featured stores
have a rent of $49.95, and anchor stores (just like your local department
store) pay $499.95 a month. Featured stores’ listings are guaranteed to rotate
through the special featured section on the eBay Stores home page. These
listings also appear on the top level of their category directory page. Anchor
stores get extra promotion, and their logos are showcased in the stores’
directory pages. There are also other benefits to owning a store: cost-per-
click advertising, sales management tools, and lots of promotional benefits
for your merchandise.
The reasonable pricing behind eBay Stores is a remarkable bargain. For as
little as $15.95 a month, you have the opportunity to sell your merchandise to
over 140 million registered users! See Table 11-1 for eBay Store listing fees.

Listing fees and monthly “rent” can be just the tip of the iceberg if you
choose to get fancy by using all kinds of options. My recommendation? Don’t
spend too much on them until you’re fully entrenched in an eBay business —
by that time, you’ll have the experience to know what to add and when. Stick
with the basics. The Final Value Fees are charges as a percentage of the sale
price and are different in Stores than on the regular eBay site. Check them
out in Table 11-2.

Opening your eBay store
Because this book is your introduction to eBay, I’ll just give you some ideas
about opening an eBay store. In my more advanced book, Starting an eBay
Business For Dummies (Wiley), I take you step-by-step through the basics of
opening your store.
Naming your store is your first challenge. Pick out a name that describes the
type of items your store will carry or one that includes your User ID. Don’t
pick a name that is so esoteric or overly creative that it doesn’t give possible
shoppers a clue as to what you carry. A creative store name and graphic logo
are pictured in Figure 11-5.
As you can see from my store page, each store can have its own categories.
You get to make them up yourself so your customers can find items within
your store in an organized manner. You can define up to 300 custom cate-
gories up to three levels deep. Each category can have a maximum of 29 
characters for each name in your store.
227
Chapter 11: Forget the Car — Drive Your Mouse to an eBay Store

Your eBay store home page has links for your Store Information: Store Policies
and About the Seller page. The About the Store Page is the same as your About
Me page (which I discuss in Chapter 14).
Spend some serious time on eBay before you open the store. Study some of
the very successful stores. You want to have enough know-how to make your
store a success!

Chapter 12
Closing the Deal and 
Shipping It Out
In This Chapter
 Staying organized
 Communicating with the buyer
 Packing and sending the item
 Purchasing stamps and services online
T
he auction’s over, and you have a winning buyer, who (you hope) is eager
to send you money. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it? It is if you watch your
step, keep on top of things, and communicate like a professional.
In this chapter, I help you figure out how to stay organized by showing you
what documents you need to keep and for how long. I also include tips and
etiquette on communicating with the buyer so that you’re most likely to
come out with positive feedback. In addition, you find out how to pack your
item, assess costs, and make sure the item reaches the buyer when you say it
will (oh, yeah . . . and in one piece).
Bookkeeping and Staying Organized
Although I don’t recommend lining your nest with every scrap from every
auction you run, you can safely keep some documents without mutating into
a giant pack rat. Until you become an eBay expert and are comfortable with
other ways to electronically store your information, you should print and file
these essentials:

 The listing page as it appeared when the auction closed: This page
gives you a record of the item name and number, the bidding history,
and a lot of other useful information. The page also includes the auction
item description (and any revisions you’ve made to it), which is handy if
the buyer argues that an item’s disintegrating before his eyes and you
honestly described it as just well loved.
You may think you don’t need this information because you can always
look it up, but here practicality rears its head: eBay makes completed
auctions seem to disappear after 30 days. However, if you use the
custom link that appears in your End of Auction e-mail (see the next
bullet), you can access the auction online for up to 90 days. Print your
auction page before you forget about it, file it where you know you can
find it, and then forget about it.
 The End of Listing e-mail you receive from eBay that notifies you that
the auction is over: If you lose this e-mail, you can’t get it back because
eBay doesn’t keep it.
I set up a separate folder in my Microsoft Outlook e-mail program for my
sold item e-mails. When one comes in, I read it and then drag it over to
its special folder. That way, I can always check this folder for the infor-
mation I need.
 E-mail between you and the buyer: In the virtual world, e-mail is as close
to having a face-to-face conversation as most people get. Your e-mail cor-
respondence is a living record of all the things you discuss with the buyer
to complete the transaction. Even if you sell just a few items a month at
eBay, keep track of who’s paid up and who owes you money. And more
importantly, if the buyer says, “I told you I’d be out of town,” you can look
through your e-mail and say, “Nope, it doesn’t show up here,” or “You’re
right! How was Tierra del Fuego? Is the payment on the way?” Or some-
thing more polite. Be sure to keep that e-mail with the headers and date
on it so that you can’t be accused of (ahem) creative writing.
 PayPal payment notices: You get a notice from PayPal when the buyer
pays for the item. The notice has the listing information and the buyer’s
shipping information. (When that e-mail arrives, the clock begins to tick
on sending out the item.)
 Any bank statements you receive that reflect a payment that doesn’t
clear: Keep anything related to payments, especially payments that
didn’t go through. That way, if a buyer says he’s sure he sent you a
check, you can say, “Yes sir, Mr. X, you did send me a check, and it was
made of the finest rubber.” Or something kinder, especially if you want
that payment.
 Any insurance forms that you have: Until the item has arrived and
you’re sure the customer is satisfied, be sure to keep those shipping and
insurance receipts.
230
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 Refund requests you make: If you make a request to eBay for a refund
from a sale that doesn’t go through, hold on to it until you can view the
credit on your statement.
 Receipts for items that you buy for the sole purpose of selling them on
eBay: This comes in handy as a reference so that you can see if you’re
making a profit. It can also be helpful at tax time.
Someday, the Internal Revenue Service (or government agency in your area)
may knock on your door. Scary, but true. Like hurricanes and asteroid strikes,
audits happen. Any accountant worth his or her salt will tell you that the best
way to handle the possibility of an audit is to be prepared for the worst —
even if every eBay transaction you conduct runs smooth as silk and you’ve
kept your nose sparkling clean. See Chapter 9 for more tax information.
If you accept online payments by PayPal (PayPal Premier or Business mem-
bers only), you can download your transaction history for use in
QuickBooks, Quicken, or Excel. Additionally, these programs are excellent
sources for your documentation.
When you’re first starting your career as a seller, once a month, conduct a By
Seller search on yourself so that you can print out all the information on the
bid histories of your most recent auctions. Do this independently of any auc-
tion software you use. Having the listings neatly printed out easily helps you
see what sold for how much and when. Chapter 5 gives you the lowdown on
how to perform this search.
When it comes to printouts of e-mails and documents about transactions, as
soon as the item arrives at the destination and you get your positive feed-
back, you can dump them. If you get negative feedback, hang on to your doc-
umentation a little longer (say, until you’re sure the issues it raises are
resolved and everyone’s satisfied). If selling on eBay becomes a fairly regular
source of income, save all receipts for items you’ve purchased to sell; for tax
purposes, that’s inventory.
231
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out
Tales from the formerly Type A
Confession time. I used to keep all my 
paperwork — listings, e-mails, the works. Now
I keep the e-mails and receipts sent to me until
I know a transaction is complete. Then they go
wafting off to the Recycle Bin so that I can still
find a file in my Outlook program.
These days, I stay on top of my eBay finances
with online auction-management that helps me
keep track of who has paid me and who hasn’t.
These programs also help me figure out my
expenses, profits, and other financial calcula-
tions, almost painlessly. (See Chapter 20 for
more information on these programs.) They can
also help jazz up the look of my auctions. Ah,
progress.

If you sell specialized items, you can keep track of trends and who your fre-
quent buyers are by saving your paperwork. This prudent habit becomes an
excellent marketing strategy when you discover that a segment of eBay users
faithfully buys your items. An audience. Imagine that.
Talking to Buyers: The ABCs 
of Good Communication
You’ve heard it countless times — talk is cheap. Compared to what? Granted,
empty promises are a dime a dozen, but honest-to-goodness talk and efficient
e-mail are worth their weight in gold and good feedback — especially at eBay.
Sometimes, not talking is costly.
A smooth exchange of money and merchandise really starts with you (the
seller) and your attitude toward the transaction. Your listing description and
then your first e-mail — soon after the over sale is made — set the entire trans-
action in motion and set the tone for that transaction. If all goes well, no more
than a few days should elapse between getting paid and sending the item.
Take a proactive approach and start the ball rolling yourself. I suggest con-
tacting the buyer and sending an invoice even before you get eBay’s e-mail.
Here’s how:
1. Start on the page of the item you sold.
Click the Send Invoice Box that appears at the top of the page. You
arrive at the Send Invoice page.
2. Examine the invoice displayed on this page. Make any changes if 
necessary.
If the buyer has purchased more than one item from you, click the link
to combine purchases.
3. Double-check that the shipping amount is correct. When you’re satis-
fied, click the Send Invoice button.
If you select the Copy Me check box on this invoice, you’ll receive a
copy of the invoice. The buyer’s copy has a link in the invoice, enabling
the buyer to pay directly to PayPal (if you accept PayPal for payment).
Figure 12-1 shows what the invoice e-mail looks like.
Signing in first puts a temporary cookie (a computer file that makes it
easier to get around a Web site) in your computer so you don’t have to
go through this process again. You have to set your preferences to do
this on your My eBay page. If you selected the Keep Me Signed In on

This Computer for One Day Unless I Sign Out check box when you signed in
to eBay, your password is saved even if you cut off your Internet connection.
Your login is saved until you click the Sign Out link. For more yummy info on
cookies, see Chapter 15.
Another way to contact your buyer is to go to your My eBay page, scroll down
to the Items I’ve Sold area, find the auction, and click the drop-down vmenu in
the Action column. From there, you can click the Contact Buyer link.
Thank you — I mean it
What do all the successful big-name department stores have in common? Yes,
great prices, good merchandise, and nice displays. But with all things being
equal, customer service always wins hands-down. One department store in
the United States, Nordstrom, has such a great reputation that the store hap-
pily took back a set of snow tires because a customer wasn’t happy with
them. No big deal, maybe — until you notice that Nordstrom doesn’t even sell
snow tires!
A friend of mine who owns restaurants calls this level of customer satisfac-
tion the Wow! effect. If customers (no matter what they’re buying) say,
Figure 12-1:
An eBay
invoice, as
sent to a
buyer.
233
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

“Wow!” during or after the transaction — admiringly or happily — you’ve sat-
isfied the customer. A good rule to go by: Give people the same level of ser-
vice you expect when you’re on the buying end. The best eBay sellers are
regular eBay buyers.
The best way to start satisfying the buyer is with an introductory e-mail.
Congratulate the person on winning the item — making him or her feel good
about the purchase — and thank the buyer for bidding on your item. A good
e-mail provides these important details:
 Item name and item number.
 Winning bid amount.
 Cost of shipping and packing, and any shipping or insurance restric-
tions. (I give pointers on determining shipping and packaging costs later
in this chapter.)
 Payment options (check, money order, credit cards, or PayPal).
 How long you will hold the item waiting for a check to clear (usually 
14 days).
 The shipping timetable.
You should also mind a few vital details in the first e-mail:
 Confirm the address (and ask for a daytime phone number if you think
you need to call); ask whether this is where you should ship the item. If
not, ask for the correct shipping address.
 Include your name and the address to which you want the payment sent.
 Remind buyers to write the item name, item number, and shipping
address on whatever form of payment they send. You’d be surprised
how many buyers forget to give you the item number. Also ask buyers to
print out and send a copy of your e-mail with the payment.
 If you’re using an online payment service, such as PayPal, be sure to give
buyers instructions on how they can pay for the auction online.
 Include your “customer service” phone number if you wish.
 Suggest that if all goes well, you’ll be happy to leave positive feedback
for the buyer. (See Chapter 4 for more on feedback.)
You can also send an invoice from your My eBay page, Items I’ve Sold area.
Click the drop-down box in the Action column next to the item. Just click the
Send Invoice link, verify all the information, and click Send Invoice. Figure
12-1 shows what the invoice e-mail looks like.
234
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Let’s keep e-mailing
If you’ve got a good transaction going (and the majority of them are), the
buyer will reply to your e-mail within a couple of business days. Customarily,
most replies come the next day. If your buyer has questions regarding any-
thing you asked in your e-mail, you’ll get those inquiries now. Most of the
time, all you get back is, “Thanks. Payment on the way.” Hey, that’s all I ask.
If any last-minute details need to be worked out, usually the buyer asks to set
up a time to call or request further instructions about the transaction.
Respond to this communication as soon as possible. If you can’t deal with it
at the moment, let the buyer know you’re working on it and will shoot those
answers back ASAP. Never let an e-mail go unanswered.
For sample e-mail letters and deeper information, get your hands on a copy
of my book on more advanced eBay selling, Starting an eBay Business For
Dummies (published by Wiley).
Shipping without Going Postal
Shipping can be the most time-consuming (and most dreaded) task for many
eBay sellers. Even if the selling portion of your transaction goes flawlessly,
the item has to get to the buyer in one piece. If it doesn’t, the deal could be
ruined — and so could your reputation.
This section briefs you on shipping etiquette, gives you details about the
three most popular shipping options (the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx
Ground), and offers tips on how to make sure your package is ready to ride.
The best way to avoid shipping problems is to do your homework before-
hand, determine which method is likely to work best, and spell out in your
item description exactly how you intend to ship the item. Here’s how I handle
the whole process:
1. After the listing is over, get the package ready to ship.
You don’t have to seal the package right away, but you should have it
ready to seal because the two critical factors in shipping are weight and
time. The more a package weighs and the faster it has to be delivered,
the higher the charge. (I cover packing materials and tips later in this
section.) The time to think about packing and shipping is before you put
the item up for sale — that way, last-minute surprises are less likely to
arise while your buyer waits impatiently for the item!
235
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

2. Know your carrier options.
In the United States, the three main shipping options for most eBay
transactions are the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS. See the section
“Shopping for a shipper” (try saying that five times fast) for how you can
get rate options from each service, painlessly and online. Compare costs
and services.
3. Before quoting the shipping fees, make sure that you include all
appropriate costs.
I recommend that you charge a nominal handling fee (up to $1.50 isn’t
out of line) to cover your packing materials, labels, and time, which can
add up quickly as you start making multiple transactions. You should
also include any insurance costs and any delivery-confirmation costs.
See the sidebar “Insuring your peace of mind (and your shipment)” for
more information.
Some eBay scam artists inflate shipping and handling costs to make
added profit. Shame, shame, shame on them. Purposely overcharging is
tacky, ugly, and immature. (It’s also a violation of eBay policy on circum-
venting fees). The buyer also often figures it out after one look at the
postage on the box.
It’s best to post the shipping amount (or use the eBay online shipping
calculator — see Chapter 10 for more on how to use this tool). This way,
buyers can include this cost when they consider their bidding strate-
gies. Figure out what the packed item will weigh and then give a good
estimate; the online calculators can help. If the item is particularly
heavy, and you need to use a shipping service that charges by weight
and distance, be sure to say in your auction description that you’re just
giving an estimate, and that the final cost will be determined after the
listing is over. Optionally, you can tell the bidder how much the item
weighs, where you’re shipping from, and what your handling charges are
(a few bidders don’t mind doing the math).
Occasionally, shipping calculations can be off-target, and you may not
know that until after you take the buyer’s money. If the mistake is in
your favor and is a biggie, notify the buyer and offer a refund. But if ship-
ping ends up costing you a bit more, take your lumps and pay it your-
self. Consider it part of the cost of doing business. You can always let
the buyer know what happened and that you paid the extra cost. Who
knows, it may show up positively on your feedback from the buyer!
(Even if it doesn’t, spreading goodwill never hurts.)
4. E-mail the buyer and congratulate him or her on winning; reiterate
what your shipping choice is and how long you expect it’ll take.
236
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Make sure you’re both talking about the same timetable. If the buyer
balks at either the price or the shipping time, try working out an option
that will make the buyer happy.
5. Send the package.
When should you ship the package? Common courtesy says it should go
out as soon as the item and shipping charges are paid. If the buyer has
followed through with his or her side of the bargain, you should do the
same. Ship that package no more than a few days after payment (or after
the check clears). If you can’t, immediately e-mail the buyer and explain
the delay. You should e-mail the buyer as soon as you send the package
and ask for an e-mail to confirm arrival after the item gets there. (Don’t
forget to put in a plug for positive feedback.)
Send a prompt follow-up e-mail to let the buyer know the item’s on the way. In
this e-mail, be sure to include when the item was sent, how long it should
take to arrive, any special tracking or delivery confirmation number (if you
have one), and a request for a return e-mail confirming arrival after the item
gets there. I also include a thank-you note (a receipt would be a business-like
addition) in each package I send out. I appreciate when I get one in eBay
packages, and it always brings a smile to the recipient’s face. It never hurts 
to take every opportunity to promote goodwill (and future business and 
positive feedback).
More often than not, you do get an e-mail back from the buyer to let you
know the item arrived safely. If you don’t, it’s a good idea to send another
e-mail (in about a week) to ask whether the item arrived in good condition. It
jogs the buyer’s memory and demonstrates your professionalism as a seller.
Use this opportunity to gently remind buyers that you’ll be leaving positive
feedback for them. Ask whether they’re satisfied and don’t be bashful about
suggesting they do the same for you. Leave positive feedback right away so
that you don’t forget.
Shopping for a shipper
If only you could transport your item the way they did on Star Trek — “Beam
up that antique lamp, Scotty!” Alas, it’s not so. Priority Mail via the U.S. Postal
Service is pretty much the eBay standard if you’re shipping within the United
States and Canada. Many Americans also rely on the USPS to ship internation-
ally as well. FedEx and UPS are global alternatives that work well, too.
237
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

Many sellers think that they are unequivocally covered by requiring their
buyers to purchase insurance. Even if your buyer opts not to pay for insur-
ance, you are still responsible for making sure that the item arrives at the
buyer’s door. Federal mail order laws state that when an item is paid for, it
must be delivered to the buyer within 30 days unless there has been an
agreement between the buyer and the seller for other arrangements.
Whether you’re at the post office, UPS, FedEx, or your doctor’s office, be
ready, willing, and able to wait in line. I definitely have a “rush hour” at my

nerves). A good time to ship is around 10:30 a.m., when everyone is still in a

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
Insuring your peace of mind (and your shipment)
Sure, “damaged in the mail” is an excuse we’ve
all heard hundreds of times, but despite every-
one’s best efforts, sometimes things do get
damaged or misplaced during shipment. The
universe is a dangerous place; that’s what
insurance is for. I usually offer to get insurance
from the shipper if the buyer wants to pay for it,
and always get it on expensive items, one-of-a-
kind items, or very fragile items. I spell out in my
item description that the buyer pays for the
insurance.
The major shippers all offer insurance that’s
fairly reasonably priced, so check out their
rates at their Web sites. But don’t forget to read
the details. For example, many items at eBay
are sold MIMB (Mint in Mint Box). True, the
condition of the original box often has a bear-
ing on the final value of the item inside, but the
U.S. Postal Service insures only what is in the
box. So, if you sold a Malibu Barbie mint in a
mint box, USPS insures only the doll and not the
original box. Pack carefully so that your buyer
gets what’s been paid for. Be mindful that ship-
pers won’t make good on insurance claims if
they suspect you of causing the damage by
doing a lousy job of packing.
Alternatively, when you’re selling on eBay in
earnest, you can purchase your own parcel
protection policy from a private insurer like U-
PIC. When you use this type of insurance, com-
bined with preprinted electronic postage, you
no longer have to stand in line at the post office
to have your insured packaged logged in by the
clerk at the counter.
Some sellers also offer their own form of self-
insurance. Realize that I use the term “self-
insurance” as a descriptive phrase only. You
may not charge your buyer for insurance unless
you are actually paying for insurance from a
licensed third-party insurance company. To do
so is a violation of state law. Here’s what I offer
my buyers at no cost to them:
 On lower-priced items, I am willing to
refund the buyer’s money if the item is lost
or damaged.
 On some items I sell, I have a risk reserve.
That means I have more than one of the item
I sold. If the item is lost or destroyed, I can
send the backup item as a replacement.

good mood. If I have to go in the afternoon, I go about 3:00 p.m., when the
clerks are back from their lunch breaks and friendly faces (mine, too — I
always smile!) can take the edge off those brusque lunchtime encounters.
Better yet, request a carrier pickup from the Post Office Web site (www.
usps.com) if you can ship from home.
Be sure to visit my Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, for introductory
offers for much of the software and services that I mention in this book.
U.S. Postal Service
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is the butt of many unfair jokes and cheap
shots, but when it comes right down to it, I think USPS is still the most effi-
cient and inexpensive way to ship items — eBay or otherwise. It also supplies
free boxes and labels for Priority and Express Mail packages. Here are some
ways eBay members get their items from here to there via USPS:
 Priority Mail: As mentioned earlier, this is the de facto standard method
of shipping for eBay users. I love the free boxes, and I like the rates. The
promised delivery time is two to three days, although I’ve experienced
rare delays of up to a week during peak holiday periods.
Cost? As of this writing (rates are always subject to change), Priority
Mail costs $4.05 for a 1-pound package. Over a pound, the charge is cal-
culated according to weight and distance.
A $4.05 flat-rate Priority envelope is also available. You can ship as much
stuff as you want — as long as you can fit it into the supplied 91⁄2 x 121⁄2
envelope. (You’ll be surprised how much stuff you can jam into those
envelopes.) You can reinforce the envelope with clear packing tape.
 Express Mail: If the item needs to be delivered the next day, use Express
Mail. The Postal Service promises delivery no later than noon the following
afternoon (even on weekends or holidays). And you can get free boxes.
Cost? Express Mail runs $14.40 for packages 8 ounces and under, $18.80
for packages 8 ounces to 2 pounds, and about $3 additional for every
pound over 2 (up to 10 pounds). Express Mail also has a flat-rate enve-
lope, which is the same size as the Priority flat-rate envelope and ships
for $14.40.
The Postal Service offers a free special pickup for Priority Mail and
Express Mail, no matter how many separate packages are included. If
you have several packages, carrier pickup is an excellent option to.
Get to know your mail carrier, and have your parcels ready and stacked
up for him or her for the regular stop at your home. The mail carrier will
be happy to take your packages back to the post office at no additional
charge. (A bottle of icy-cold water for your letter carrier on hot days will
go a long way in your relationship!)
239
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

 First-Class Mail: If your item weighs 13 ounces or less, you can use First-
Class Mail. First-Class Mail is slightly cheaper than Priority Mail — the
first ounce is $0.39, and every additional ounce is $0.24.
 Media Mail: This is a popular option among those who sell books on
eBay. It’s the new name for two older products, Book Rate and Special
Standard Mail. Media Mail rates start at $1.59 for the first pound and
increase by $0.48 cents for each additional pound.
 Other options: The Postal Service offers all sorts of add-ons. I always get
the Delivery Confirmation service that you can add to Priority Mail, as
well as other mailing services. A mere $0.50 cents — free on electronic
purchases. It buys you the knowledge of when and where your item was
delivered. With the parcel’s delivery confirmation number, you can
check on whether the package was delivered (or whether an attempt
was made to deliver it) by calling 800-222-1811 in the United States. 
If you type in the number online at www.usps.com/shipping/
trackandconfirm.htm, you can get a more complete report.
If you’re an occasional shipper (you buy more than you sell on eBay) and
don’t use PayPal, you can print out bar-coded shipping labels with free deliv-
ery confirmation (for Priority Mail only) at the USPS site. No online e-mail
functions are available, so you have to do all the e-mailing and record keeping
yourself. But hey, the service is free. Just go to www.usps.com and find the
Click-N-Ship link.
Delivery confirmation also comes in handy if you try to collect insurance 
for an item that was never delivered or if the buyer says the item was never
delivered. It gives you proof from the Postal Service that the item was sent. 
(I explain insuring shipments later in this chapter.) But understand that you
cannot accurately track your package. Delivery confirmation is merely proof
that the package was mailed and delivered. If your package gets lost in the
mail for a few weeks, this number rarely acts as a tracking number and won’t
reveal the location of your package until it’s delivered.
The USPS Web site (www.usps.com) gives you an overview of the U.S. Postal
Service rates so that you can see all your options. It sure beats standing in
that endless line! For a complete explanation of domestic rates, check out
this page at www.usps.com/consumers/domestic.htm.
Even better, USPS has a page that can help you determine exactly what your
item costs to mail (after you’ve packaged it and weighed it, of course). Start at
the Rate Calculator page at postcalc.usps.gov and follow the instructions.

UPS
The folks in the brown UPS trucks love eBay. The options they offer vary,
with everything from overnight service to the UPS Ground service. UPS also
takes many of the odd-shaped large boxes, such as those for computer equip-
ment that the U.S. Postal Service won’t.
UPS makes pickups, but you have to know the exact weight of your package
so that you can pay when the UPS driver shows up. UPS charges for this ser-
vice unless you have a daily shipper account and ship a minimum number of
packages with UPS per week.
The rates for the same UPS shipment can vary based on whether you have a
business account with UPS, whether the package goes to or is picked up at a
residence, and whether you use the right kind of form. If you’re going to use
UPS regularly, be sure to set up an account directly with UPS.
You can find the UPS home page at www.ups.com. For rates, click the
Shipping tab and then click Estimate Cost on the left side of the page, which
gives you prices based on zip codes and package weights. (Note the ominous
“estimate” rates.)

Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out
Sí, oui, ja, yes! Shipping internationally
Money’s good no matter what country it comes
from. I don’t know why, but lots of people seem
to be afraid to ship internationally and list “I
don’t ship overseas” on the auction page. Of
course, sending an item that far away may be a
burden if you’re selling a car or a street-
sweeper (they don’t fit in boxes too well), but
I’ve found that sending a package across the
Atlantic can be just as easy as shipping across
state lines. The only downside: My shipper of
choice, the U.S. Postal Service, does not insure
packages going to certain countries (check
with your post office to find out which ones;
they seem to change with the headlines), so I
use private shipping insurance.
Here are a couple of other timely notes about
shipping internationally:
 You need to tell what’s inside the package.
Be truthful when declaring value on cus-
toms forms. Be sure to use descriptions
that customs agents can figure out without
knowing eBay shorthand terms. For exam-
ple, instead of declaring the contents as
“MIB Barbie,” call it a “small doll.” Some
countries require buyers to pay special
duties and taxes, depending on the item
and the value. But that’s the buyer’s
headache.
 Wherever you send your package (espe-
cially if it’s going to a country where English
is not the native language), be sure to write
legibly. (Imagine getting a package from
Russia and having to decipher a label writ-
ten in the Cyrillic alphabet. ’Nuff said.)

The UPS.com Quick Cost Calculator prices are based on what UPS charges
regular and high-volume users. When you get to the counter, the price may
be higher than what you find on the Web.
My favorite link on the UPS site is the transit map that shows the United
States and how long it takes to reach any place in the country (based on the
originating zip code). If you’re thinking of shipping that compact refrigerator
to Maine, you can check out this fun and informative page at www.ups.
com/using/services/servicemaps/servicemaps.html.
If you have a UPS account, it’s useful to buy the delivery confirmation option
for $1.25. As soon as the package gets to its destination and is signed for, UPS
sends you back a confirmation so that you have evidence that it has been
delivered. But what’s really cool is the free UPS online tracking. Every pack-
age is bar-coded and that code is read everywhere your package stops along
its shipping route. You can follow its progress by entering the package number
at www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html.
FedEx
I use FedEx Express air all the time for rush business, but Express seems
rather expensive for my eBay shipping. However, if the buyer wants it fast
and is willing to pay, I’ll send it by FedEx overnight, you bet.
FedEx Ground service has competitive prices and carries all the best features
of FedEx. I use FedEx Ground for items that are heavy (say, antique barbells)
or extremely large (such as a 1920s steamer trunk), because FedEx ships any-
thing up to 150 pounds in a single box — 80 more pounds than the U.S. Postal
Service takes. FedEx also delivers on Saturdays — which UPS won’t. It also
charges $4 to pick up items from shippers who ship less than $60 in weekly
package charges.
I also like the FedEx boxes. Like one of my favorite actors, Joe Pesci, from My
Cousin Vinny and the Lethal Weapon movies, these boxes are small but tough.
But if you’re thinking of reusing these boxes to ship with another service,
forget it. The FedEx logo is plastered all over every inch of the freebies, and
the company may get seriously peeved about it. You can’t use those fancy
boxes for its ground service.
The FedEx Ground Home Delivery service is a major competitor for UPS. The
rates are competitive, and FedEx offers a money-back guarantee (if it misses
the delivery window) for residential ground delivery. For residential delivery,
FedEx charges an additional $1.75 per package. A 2-pound package going
from Los Angeles to a residence in New York City takes five days and costs
$7.83. FedEx includes online package tracking and insurance up to $100 in
242
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

this price. You have to be a business to avail yourself of home delivery — but
plenty of home businesses exist.
The same 2-pound U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail package with $100 insur-
ance and a delivery confirmation costs you $8.35. (But remember, you know
how to get free Delivery Confirmation forms, and insurance can cost much
less with private package insurance!) Granted, the package will arrive within
two to three days, but FedEx Ground guarantees a five-day delivery, and I’ve
had a few Priority Mail packages take up to two weeks. FedEx Ground won’t
supply boxes for you, so you’re on your own there. When you drop off your
box at UPS, you can get five-day service for $8.05.
You can find the FedEx home page at www.fedex.com/us. The link for rates
is conveniently located at the top of the page.
Getting the right (packing) stuff
You can never think about packing materials too early. You may think you’re
jumping the gun, but by the law of averages, if you wait until the last minute,
you won’t find the right-size box, approved tape, or the labels you need. Start
thinking about shipping even before you sell your first item.
Before you pack, give your item the once-over. Here’s a checklist of what to
consider about your item before you call it a wrap (gotta love that Hollywood
lingo):
 Is your item as you described it? If the item has been dented or torn
somehow, e-mail the winning bidder immediately and come clean. And if
you sell an item with its original box or container, don’t just check the
item, make sure the box is in the same good condition as the item inside.
Collectors place a high value on original boxes, so make sure the box
lives up to what you described in your listing. Pack to protect it as well.
 Is the item dirty or dusty, or does it smell of smoke? Some buyers may
complain if the item they receive is dirty or smelly, especially from ciga-
rette smoke. Make sure the item is fresh and clean, even if it’s used or
vintage. If something’s dirty, check to make sure you know how to clean
it properly (you want to take the dirt off, not the paint), and then give it
a spritz with an appropriate cleaner or just soap and water. If you can’t
get rid of the smell or the dirt, say so in your item description. Let the
buyer decide whether the item is desirable with aromas and all.
If the item has a faint smell of smoke or is a bit musty, a product called
Febreze may help. Just get a plastic bag, give your item a spritz, and
keep it in the bag for a short while. Note: This is not recommended for
cardboard. And, as with any solvent or cleaning agent, read the label
243
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

before you spray. Or, if you’re in a rush to mail the package, cut a 1-inch x
1-inch piece of sheet fabric softener and place it in a plastic bag with the
product.
When the item’s ready to go, you’re ready to pack it up. The following sec-
tions give you suggestions on what you should consider using and where to
find the right stuff.
Packing material: What to use
This may sound obvious, but you’d be surprised: Any list of packing material
should start with a box. But you don’t want just any box — you want a heavy
cardboard type that’s larger than the item. If the item is extremely fragile, I
suggest you use two boxes, with the outer box about 3 inches larger on each
side than the inner box that holds the item, to allow for extra padding. And if
you still have the original shipping container for such things as electronic
equipment, consider using the original, especially if it still has the original
foam inserts (they were designed for the purpose, and this way they stay out
of the environment awhile longer).
As for padding, Table 12-1 compares the most popular types of box-filler
material.

Cons: Cost, time to pop.
Whatever materials you use, make sure that you pack the item well and 
that you secure the box. Many shippers will contest insurance claims if they
feel you did a lousy job of packing. Do all the little things that you’d want
done if you were the buyer — using double boxes for really fragile items,
wrapping lids separately from containers, and filling hollow breakables with
some kind of padding. Here are a few other items you need:
 Plastic bags: Plastic bags protect your item from moisture. I once sent a
MIB doll to the Northeast, and the package got caught in a snowstorm.
The buyer e-mailed me with words of thanks for the extra plastic bag,
which saved the item from being soaked along with the outer box.
(Speaking of boxes, if you send an item in an original box, bag it.)
For any small items, such as stuffed animals, you should always protect
them in a lunch baggie. For slightly larger items, go to the 1-quart or 1-
gallon size. Be sure to wrap any paper or cloth products, such as cloth-
ing and linens, in plastic before you ship.
245
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

 Bubble-padded mailers: The shipping cost for a package that weighs
less than 13 ounces (First-Class Mail) is usually considerably cheaper
than Priority. Many small items, clothing, books, and so on will fit com-
fortably into the many available sizes of padded envelopes. You can find
them made of Kraft paper or extra sturdy vinyl. A big plus is that they
weigh considerably less than boxes — even when using extra padding.
See Table 12-2 for standard sizes.
 Address labels: You’ll need extras because it’s always a good idea to
toss a duplicate address label inside the box, with the destination
address and a return address, in case the outside label falls off or
becomes illegible.
 Two- or 3-inch shipping tape: Make sure that you use a strong shipping
tape for the outside of the box. Clear plastic will do just fine. There is
also box-color tape that works very well for recycling boxes (taping over
old shipping information). Remember not to plaster every inch of box
with tape; leave space for those Fragile and Insured rubber stamps.
 Hand-held shipping tape dispensers: It’s quite a bit easier to zzzzzip!
tape from a tape dispenser than to unwind it and bite it off with your
teeth. Have one dispenser for your special shipping tape and one for
your clear tape.
 Lightweight 2-inch clear tape: For taping the padding around the inside
items. I also use a clear strip of tape over the address on the outside of
the box so that it won’t disappear in the rain.
246
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
Storing those bags of plump packing peanuts
By now, you may have realized that I have com-
mandeered a large chunk of my home for my
eBay business, and you might think that I live in
a giant swamp of packing materials. Not really.
But I do have to store loads of packing peanuts.
They’re not heavy, but they sure are bulky!
If you have a house with a garage, you’re set!
Bear with me now, my plan isn’t as crazy as it
seems. Go to your local store and purchase
some large screw-in cup hooks. Then purchase
the largest drawstring plastic bags you can
find. (I’m partial to Glad 39-gallon Lawn & Leaf
bags.)
Screw the cup hooks into strategic locations on
the ceiling rafters of your garage. Now fill the
drawstring bags to capacity with packing
peanuts and hang. When you’ve finished your
garage will look like some bizarre art installa-
tion, but it gets the packing peanuts off the floor
and out of your hair. I even set up a packing-
peanuts barricade so I don’t hit the end of my
garage when I park!

 Scissors: A pair of large, sharp scissors. Having a hobby knife to trim
boxes or shred newspaper is also a good idea.
 Handy liquids: Three that I like are GOO GONE (which is available in the
household supply section of most retail stores and is a wonder at remov-
ing unwanted stickers and price tags); WD-40 (the unstick-everything
standby that works great on getting stickers off plastic); and Un-Du (the
best liquid I’ve found to take labels off cardboard). Lighter fluid also
does the trick, but be very careful handling it and be sure to clean up
thoroughly to remove any residue.
 Rubber stamps/stickers: Using custom rubber stamps or stickers can
save you a bunch of time when preparing your packages. I purchased
some return address self-inking rubber stamps (at an unbelievably low
price) on eBay from the Melrose Stamp Company (eBay User ID Melrose
Stamp). I use these stamps to stamp all kinds of things that require my
identification. I also use their fluorescent Red SCAN NOW stickers next
to My Delivery Confirmations.
 Thermal label printer: Once I thought this was a flagrant waste of
money, but now I wouldn’t be without one. When you begin shipping
several packages a week, you’ll find it far more convenient to use a sepa-
rate label printer for addressing and delivery confirmations. Dymo offers
one of the best deals on a quality you can find them on eBay for about
$100. If you want to get industrial, try one of the Zebra (I use the LP2844)
thermal printers. These printers can print labels for Fed Ex and UPS as
well as USPS (you can also get deals on these on eBay).
 Black permanent marker: These are handy for writing information
(“Please leave on porch behind the planter”) and the all-important
“Fragile” all over the box or “Do Not Bend” on envelopes. I like the big,
fat Sharpie markers.

If you plan to sell on eBay in earnest, consider adding a 10-pound weight
scale (for weighing packages) to your shipping department. I’m using a super
small 13-pound maximum scale, which I bought on eBay for only $29.95.
When it comes to fragile items, dishes, pottery, porcelain, china — anything
that can chip, crack, or smash into a thousand pieces — double box. The
boxes should be about 3 inches different on each side. Make sure that you
use enough padding so that the interior box is snug. Just give it a big shake. If
nothing rattles, ship away!
Packing material: Where to find it
The place to start looking for packing material is the same place you should
start looking for things to sell at eBay: your house. Between us, I’ve done
over a thousand eBay transactions and never once paid for a carton. Because
I buy most of my stuff from catalogs and online companies (I love e-commerce),
I save all the boxes, bubble wrap, padding, and packing peanuts I get in the
mail. Just empty your boxes of packing peanuts into large plastic trash bags
— that way, they don’t take up much storage space. If you recently got a mail-
order shipment box that was used only once — and it’s a good, sturdy box
with no dents or dings — there’s nothing wrong with using it again. Just be
sure to completely cover any old labels so the delivery company doesn’t get
confused.
Beyond the ol’ homestead, here are a couple of other suggestions for places
where you can rustle up some packing stuff:
 Your local supermarket, department store, or drugstore: You won’t be
the first person pleading with a store manager for boxes. (Ah, fond mem-
ories of moving days past. . . .) Stores actually like giving them away
because it saves them the extra work of compacting the boxes and
throwing them away.
248
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

I found that drugstores and beauty supply stores have a better variety of
smaller boxes. But make sure that you don’t take dirty boxes reeking of
food smells.
 The inside of your local supermarket, department store, or drugstore:
Places like Kmart, Wal-Mart, Target, and office-supply stores often have
good selections of packing supplies.
 Shippers like UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service: These shippers
offer all kinds of free supplies as long as you use these supplies to ship
things with their service.
The Postal Service also ships free boxes, packing tape, labels, and ship-
ping forms for Express Mail, Priority Mail, and Global Priority Mail to
your house. In the United States, you can order by phone (800-222-1811)
or online (shop.usps.com). Here are a couple of rules for USPS orders:
• Specify the service (Priority Mail, Express Mail, or Global Priority
Mail) you’re using because the boxes and the labels all come with
the service name printed all over them, and you can only use them
for that specific service.
• Order in bulk. For example, address labels come in rolls of 500 and
boxes in packs of 25.
• The boxes come flat, so you have to assemble them. Hey, don’t
look a gift box in the mouth — they’re free!
 eBay Sellers: Many terrific eBay sellers are out to offer you really good
deals. (You can’t beat eBay sellers for quality goods, low prices, and
great service.) I recommend the following family-run eBay stores:
• Grasup (GraMur Supply Co), based in Texas, is where I buy my
vinyl padded envelope mailers for my eBay sales. This company
also sells Tyvek envelopes, Kraft paper bubble mailers, zipper-lock
plastic bags, air pillows, box sealing tape, and lots more.
• Bubblefast — an eBay seller from the Chicago area — sells tons of
reasonably priced bubble wrap, mailers, and more on eBay.
• Melrose Stamp is based in New York (but its items are tiny, so
shipping isn’t a huge issue). Melrose Stamp mainly sells custom
and stock message rubber stamps. Also, rolls of package identifica-
tion labels such as Fragile, Scan Me, First Class, Media Mail, and
Airmail.
Notice that I mention where these vendors are located. When ordering a large
shipment, the distance it has to travel from the vendor’s place to yours can
tack on quite a bit of cash (and time) to your shipping costs!

Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

Buying Postage Online
Isn’t technology great? You no longer have to schlep to the post office every
time you need stamps. What’s even better, with the new print-it-yourself
postage, you can give all your packages directly to your mail carrier. When you
install your Internet postage software, you apply for a USPS postal license that
allows you to print your own Information Based Indicia (IBI) for your postage.
IBI is a bar code printed either on labels or directly on an envelope and has
both human- and machine-readable information about where it was printed
and security-related elements. IBI provides you, and the post office, with a
much more secure way of getting your valuable packages through the mail.
You can print postage for First Class, Priority, Express, and Parcel Post, and addi-
tional postage for delivery confirmations and insurance. If your printer mangles a
sheet of labels or an envelope, you can send the printed piece to your Internet
postage provider for a refund. Several vendors of Internet-based postage exist,
but Endicia Internet Postage, RedRoller and Stamps.com are the most popular.

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
RedRoller, RedRoller, will we all come over?
There’s a new, independent service for online
sellers called RedRoller. It’s an online shipping
Web site that allows you to compare the
charges from four major shipping options:
USPS, FedEx Express air service, FedEx
Ground, FedEx Home Delivery, and DHL).
Unfortunately UPS is not partnering with
RedRoller as of this writing, but a quick com-
parison using the eBay Shipping Calculator
shows me that the UPS prices can’t compete
with the prices found on RedRoller. I’ve used
RedRoller just to compare shipping costs in the
past, but when I finally ponied up to register on
the site, I found some incredible features.
When you register you are able to access
better rates and more services from the carri-
ers on the site. RedRoller directly integrates
with your My eBay page. That way you can
easily and simply print postage and labels, and
send out e-mails all from one online locale. The
best part? There’s absolutely no additional
charge to you, the shipper. To get a sample of
RedRoller’s pricing capabilities, go over to
www.redroller.com and:
1. On the left side of the home page you can
fill your package information into a form.
Enter your zip code (or the zip code of the
city you’ll be sending the package from),
the zip code of the address you’re sending
it to, and the size and weight of the pack-
age. Also indicate whether the package is
going to a residence or business.
2. Click the Compare Rates button.
You’re taken to a page that displays rates
and delivery times. This page shows you
the costs of the services and how many
days it will take to ship the package to its
final destination. Click the link under the
carrier’s logo for more information on that
service.
It’s new, but from the looks of its site, it may just be
the next new thing in shipping for eBay sellers.

Endicia Internet Postage
In the early 90s, a couple guys came up with new software to enable people
to design direct-mail pieces from the desktop. WOW! What an innovation.
With the inexpensive software, you could also produce your own bar coding
for the Postal Service. I used that software then, like I use DAZzle now.
DAZzle — combined with the patented Dial-A-Zip — became the basis for the
software that comes free with the Endicia Internet Postage service. There
isn’t a more robust mailing program on the market.
Endicia has all the basic features and more:
 Prints postage for all classes of mail, including international. From
Anniston, Alabama, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the DAZzle software not
only prints postage, but also lists all your shipping options and applica-
ble rates.
For international mailing, Endicia advises you about any prohibitions
(no prison-made goods can be mailed to Botswana), any restrictions,
any necessary customs forms, and areas served within the country.
 Provides free delivery confirmations on Priority Mail. You can print
electronic delivery confirmations for First Class, Parcel Post, and Media
Mail for only $0.14 each (a savings of $0.46 from Postal Service purchase).
 Enables you to design mail pieces. The software enables you to design
envelopes, postcards, and labels with color graphics, logos, and text
messages. You can print your labels with postage and delivery confirma-
tion on anything from plain paper (tape it on with clear tape) to 4 x 6
labels in a label printer.
 Integrates with U-PIC private insurance. If you’re saving time and
money using a private package insurer, you can send your monthly
insurance logs electronically to U-PIC at the end of the month.
Endicia offers two levels of service. All the preceding features come with the
standard plan for $9.95 a month (if paid annually, $99.95). The premium plan
adds additional special features, customizable e-mail, enhanced online trans-
action reports and statistics, business reply mail, return shipping labels (pre-
paid so your customer won’t have to pay for the return), and stealth indicias
for $15.95 a month, or $174.95 paid annually.
A “stealth” indicia (also known as the postage-paid indicia) is an awesome
tool for the eBay seller. By using this feature, your customers can’t see the
exact amount of postage that you paid for the package. This way, you can add
reasonable shipping and handling costs and not inflame buyers when they
see the final label.
251
Chapter 12: Closing the Deal and Shipping It Out

Shipping Directly from PayPal
I consider PayPal shipping to be required for all beginning eBay sellers. 
By using PayPal, a seller can streamline the buyer’s shopping experience,
making it simple to buy, click, and pay. Those out in the eBay world who
haven’t used PayPal find using the service to be a life-changing experience.
Because you don’t need to use additional software or sign up with an addi-
tional service, shipping with PayPal is a convenient system for those who
don’t have to ship many packages each week.
When you’re ready to deal with shipping, you simply sign on to your PayPal
account and handle it right on the site. You can also click the Print Label link
from the item’s page to start the process. There’s no charge for the service
and you have a choice of U.S Postal Service or UPS (sorry, no FedEx Ground).

Troubleshooting Your Transaction
In This Chapter
 Dealing with a difficult buyer
 Handling other auction mishaps
 Ending an auction early
 Canceling an auction after it ends
 Getting refunds from eBay
 Relisting an item
T
here’s no getting around it: The more transactions you conduct at eBay,
the more chances you have of facing some potential pitfalls. In this chap-
ter, I give you pointers on how to handle an obnoxious buyer as if he or she is
your new best friend (for a little while anyway). In addition, I explain how to
keep an honest misunderstanding from blowing up into a vitriolic e-mail war.
You find out how to handle a sale that’s (shall I say) on a road to nowhere,
how to get some attention, and if it all goes sour, how to sell to the next high-
est bidder legally, relist the item, and get back the Final Value Fee you paid
eBay. There’s no way that all of what I mention here will happen to you, but
the more you know, the better prepared you’ll be.
Dealing with a Buyer 
Who Doesn’t Respond
Most of the time, the post-auction transaction between buyers and sellers
goes smoothly. However, if you have difficulty communicating with the
winner of your auction or store sale, you should know the best way to 
handle the situation.

You’ve come to the right place if you want help dealing with potential non-
paying buyers (more commonly known as deadbeat bidders, which is how I
refer to them). Of course, you should start with good initial post-auction com-
munication; see Chapter 12 for details. (For more information on how to deal
with a fraudulent seller, see Chapter 16.)
Going into nudge mode
Despite my best efforts, sometimes things fall through the cracks. Buyers
(who want to pay for their item through an online service) should pay for the
item without delay through PayPal, or, in the case of mail payments, buyers,
and sellers should contact each other within three business days of the close
of the sale. Sometimes winners contact sellers immediately, and some use
Checkout and pay for the item immediately, which saves you any hassle.
However, if you don’t hear from the buyer within three business days of your
initial contact, my advice is don’t panic.
People are busy; they travel, they get sick, computers crash, or sometimes
your auction simply slips the winner’s mind. After four days of no communi-
cation, you can go to your My eBay page and send out a payment reminder
message. You find the Contact Buyer link on the item’s listing page, as shown
in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1:
The Contact
Buyer link 
in the 
item page.
254
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

You might also consider just resending the invoice. Just go to the Selling area of
your My eBay page and click the menu in the action column next to the item.
If a couple more days pass and you haven’t heard from the winner, you need
to get into big-time nudge-nudge mode — as in, “Mr. X, remember me and your
obligation to buy the Tiffany lamp you won at eBay last week?”
Send a polite-but-firm message letting Mr. X know that when he bid and won
your auction, he became obligated to pay and complete the transaction. If Mr.
X doesn’t intend to buy your item for any reason, he needs to let you know
immediately.
Don’t threaten your buyer. The last thing you want to do is add insult to
injury in case the buyer is facing a real problem. Besides, if the high bidder
goes to sleep with the fishes, you’ll never see your money.
Here’s what to include in your nudge-nudge e-mail:
 A gentle admonishment, such as, “Perhaps this slipped your mind,” or
“You may have missed my e-mail to you,” or “I’m sure you didn’t mean to
ignore my first e-mail.”
 A gentle reminder that eBay’s policy is that every bid is a binding con-
tract. You can even refer the buyer to eBay’s rules and regulations if 
you want.
 A statement that firmly (but gently) explains that, so far, you’ve held up
your side of the deal and you’d appreciate it if he did the same.
 A date by which you expect to see payment. Gently explain that if the
deadline isn’t met, you’ll have no other choice but to consider the deal
invalid.
Technically, you can nullify the transaction if you don’t hear from a buyer
within three business days. However, eBay members are a forgiving bunch
under the right circumstances. I think you should give your buyer a one-week
grace period after the auction ends to get in touch with you and set up a pay-
ment plan. If, at the end of the grace period, you don’t see any real progress
toward closing the deal, say goodnight, Gracie. Consider the deal kaput and
go directly to the section “Auction Going Badly? Cut Your Losses” (later in
this chapter) to find out what recourse you have.
Be a secret agent, man
I’d like to say that history repeats itself, but that would be a cliché. (All right,
you caught me, but clichés are memorable because they’re so often true.)
255
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

After you send your polite and gentle nudge-nudge e-mail, but before you
decide that the transaction is a lost cause, take a look at the bidder’s feed-
back history. Figure 13-2 shows you what feedback looks like (of course, all
this feedback is positive. It’s tough (but possible) to be this perfect.
To check a bidder’s feedback (starting at your item page), do the following:
1. Click the number in parentheses next to your winner’s User ID.
This action takes you to the member’s feedback profile page.
2. Scroll down the feedback profile page and read the comments.
Check to see if the bidder has gotten negative feedback from previous
sellers. Make a note of it in case you need some support and background
information (should you be chastised at a later date for blocking an
unwanted bid).
3. Conduct a Bidder search.
Click Advanced Search and do an Items by Bidder search to see the
buyer’s conduct in previous transactions. How many items has the
buyer won? Click the item number to see the history of the auction. For
more info on Bidder searches, check out Chapter 5.

256
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

If you’re running a listing for a high-dollar item, you may want to prequalify
your bidders. At the very least, be sure to check them out as an auction pro-
gresses. eBay helps out here by allowing you to preapprove bidders in your
auctions. If bidders are not preapproved by you, they can’t bid; eBay tells
them they have to contact you by e-mail before their bids will be accepted.
You can add or delete bidders from your list until the listing ends. You’ll find
a link to block or preapprove bidders on your My eBay Selling page in the
extended Selling-Related Links (click More at the bottom of the list). Or you
can go directly to the Buyer/Bidder Management area at pages.ebay.com/
services/buyandsell/biddermanagement.html.
When all else fails, you may want to double-check with some of the bidder’s
previous sellers. It’s okay to use eBay’s e-mail system to contact previous
sellers who’ve dealt with the bidder. They’re often happy to give you details
on how well (or badly) the transaction went.
If the buyer’s feedback profile provides any indication that the buyer has
gone AWOL in the past, start thinking about getting out of the transaction
before too much time passes. If the buyer looks to be on the level, continue
to give him or her the benefit of the doubt.
Be sure to ask previous sellers that dealt with the bidder the following ques-
tions (politely):
 Did Buyer “X” pay on time?
 Did his or her check clear?
 Did he or she communicate well?
When e-mailing a third party about any negative feedback he or she has 
left, choose your words carefully. There’s no guarantee that if you trash the
bidder, the third party will keep your e-mail private. Make sure that you stick
to the facts. Writing false or malicious statements can put you in danger of
being sued.
Stepping up your nudge a notch
If you don’t hear from the winner after a week, your next course of action is
to contact the winner by phone. To get the contact information of an eBay
member for transaction purposes only, do the following:
1. Click the Advanced Search link below the Search box in the top-right
corner of most eBay pages.
You arrive at the Advanced Search area.
257
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

2. Click the Find Contact Information link under the Members area in
the left had side link box.
3. In the Contact Info box, enter the User ID of the person you’re trying
to contact and the item number of the transaction in question.
4. Click the Search button.
eBay e-mails you the registered contact information of the person with
whom you want to be in touch and also sends your contact information to
that person.
Wait a day before calling the person. I like sending a last-chance e-mail after
seven days that says you want to put the item back up at eBay if the buyer is
no longer interested. Also, mention that you want to apply for any credits you
can get from eBay due to an incomplete transaction. If enough money is
involved in the transaction, and you feel it’s worth the investment, make the
call to the winner. eBay automatically sends your request and your informa-
tion to the bidder, and that may be enough of a nudge to get some action.
If you do get the person on the phone, keep the conversation like your 
e-mail — friendly but businesslike. Explain who you are and when the auction
closed, and ask if any circumstances have delayed the bidder’s reply. Often,
the bidder will be so shocked to hear from you that you’ll receive payment
immediately, or you’ll know this person is a complete deadbeat.
Try a last-ditch emergency effort
If e-mails and phoning the winner don’t work, and you really want to give 
the buyer one last chance to complete the transaction, check out eBay’s
Emergency Contact Board. (You get there from the Chat link on the main
Community page.) The Emergency Contact Board is where members who are
having trouble contacting buyers and sellers leave word. Don’t worry that the
buyer may miss your message. A conscientious group of eBay pros man this
area and try to help by passing on e-mails to the missing parties. Jump over
to Chapter 17 for more information on this board and its group of regulars.
Figure 13-3 shows you what the Emergency Contact Board looks like.
From personal experience, I can tell you that if you haven’t heard from the
buyer within seven days, you’re not going to hear from him or her. No
amount of e-mailing or phone calls will save the transaction. The information
here is for those die-hards who really want to follow it through. After a week I
file an Unpaid Item report. (That definitely gets buyers’ attention.)
258
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

To post a message on the Emergency Contact Board, do the following:
1. Click the Community link on the main navigation bar at the top of
most eBay pages.
You’re taken to the Community hub page.
2. Click the Chat Rooms link in the Connect area of the page.
You’re taken to the Chat Rooms page, which lists all of eBay’s chat boards.
3. In the General Chat Rooms category, click the Emergency Contact link.
You’re taken to the Emergency Contact Board.
Before you post a message, scroll through the postings and look for mes-
sages from your AWOL buyer. Maybe he or she has been trying to get in
touch with you, too.
4. To access the Chat Board, you must sign again. Click the Sign In link
and type your User ID and password in the appropriate boxes. Then
type your message where you want to post it.
Even though you may feel like the transaction is a lost cause when you
get to the point of posting a message on the Emergency Contact Board,
keep your message neutral, and don’t make accusations.
5. Check your message for errors and click the Save My Message button.
Your message is instantly posted.

259
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

Not sure what to post on the Emergency Contact Board? Start off by sticking
to the facts of the transaction and say what you want your buyer to do. Have
the item number and the buyer’s User ID handy before you start your post-
ing. Be sure not to post any personal information about the buyer, such as
the buyer’s real name and address. That is a violation of the eBay rules.
You can send messages to specific users or post a general cry for help. Here
are two examples of short-but-sweet postings that get your message across:
 Dear Mr. X, I’ve been trying to reach you through e-mail and phone for
two weeks about item number XXXXX and have had no response. Please
contact me by (leave date), or I will invalidate the transaction and leave
negative feedback.
 I’ve been trying to contact Mr. X for two weeks now regarding an auc-
tion. Does anybody know this person or have a new e-mail address for
him? Did anybody get burned by this buyer in the past? Thanks.
For your postings to be useful, you need to check back often and read other
eBay users’ postings on the Emergency Contact Board. Check the board to
see whether someone has responded to your message. Also, keep your eyes
open as you scroll through the board. Don’t trash anyone on this board — it’s
not good form — but many people do use the Emergency Contact Board to
issue an all-points bulletin about bad eBay members.
Some Other Auction Problems
I’m not quite sure why, but where money is involved, sometimes people act
weird. Buyers may suddenly decide that they can’t purchase an item after
they’ve made a commitment, or there may be payment problems or shipping
problems. Whatever the problem, look no further than this section to find out
how to make things better.
The buyer backs out of the transaction
Every time eBay members place a bid or click Buy It Now, they make a com-
mitment to purchase the item in question — in theory, anyway. In the real
world, people have second thoughts, despite the rules. You have every right
to be angry that you’re losing money and wasting your time. Remind the
buyer that making a bid is a binding contract. But, unfortunately, if the
winner won’t pay up, you can’t do much except apply for a Final Value Fee
refund and make the winner pay with negative feedback. Jump to Chapter 6
to find out more about buyer’s remorse.
260
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Keeping your cool
By all means, if the winner of your auction tells you that the transaction can’t
be completed, no matter what the reason, remain professional, despite your
anger. For one thing, at least such a would-be buyer has the heart to break
the news to you instead of ignoring your e-mail and phone calls.
When Plan A fails, try Plan B, or even C — Second Chance Offer
You have several options if the winner backs out:
 You can make a Second Chance Offer: Offer the item to another
bidder from the auction. eBay offers a little-known feature called
Second Chance Offer, which protects buyers just as if they were the
winner of the auction. This is a great feature that turned the previously
eBay-illegal practice of side deals into fair and approved auction deals.
You can make a Second Chance Offer to any underbidder from your auc-
tion (at the amount of their high bid) for up to 60 days after the auc-
tion’s end. The steps that follow this list detail how to make a Second
Chance Offer.
 You can request a full or partial Final Value Fee credit and then relist
the item and hope it sells again. (I give you more information on
requesting a Final Value Fee credit and relisting your item, later in this
chapter.) Who knows? This bidder may actually earn you money in the
long run if you relist the item and get a higher winning bid.
To make a Second Chance Offer, follow these steps:
1. Go to the completed auction page.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the Seller Status area at the top of the page and
click the Second Chance link.
You’re taken to the Second Chance Offer page, which has the auction
number already filled in.
3. Click Continue.
The page shown in Figure 13-4 appears.
4. Select an underbidder (or more than one underbidder if you have
multiples of the item) to offer the item to and then click the Review
Second Chance Offer link.
When you make a Second Chance Offer, you can give the recipient one,
three, five, or seven days to take you up on the offer. You are not
charged a listing fee for the item, but you are responsible for Final Value
Fees if the transaction is completed.
5. Check over the offer and then click Submit to send it to the underbidder.

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
Leaving feedback after an imperfect 
auction experience
If the buyer never materializes, backs out,
bounces a check, or moves slower than a glac-
ier to send your payment (but wants the 
item sent overnight from Boston to Khartoum at
your expense), you need to think about how 
you want to word your feedback. You’re well
within your rights to leave negative feedback,
but that doesn’t mean you can go off the deep
end. Remember to stick to the facts and don’t get
personal.
Here are a few feedback tips:
 If the transaction was shaky but everything
turned out all right in the end, go ahead and
leave positive or neutral feedback, depend-
ing on how tough things went.
 If a blizzard stopped planes out of Chicago
for three days and that’s why it took a long
time to get your check, take a deep breath,
blame the fates, and leave positive feedback.
 If the buyer was a living nightmare, take a long
break before leaving negative feedback —
and have someone you love and trust read
it before you send something into the vir-
tual world that you can’t take back.
For more information on leaving feedback,
check out Chapters 4 and 6.

and make good, whereas unscrupulous winners will offer lame excuses.
Either way, insist on a more secure form of payment, like a money order or
payment with a credit card through PayPal. I also require those who send
bounced checks to include an extra $20 with their payment. This covers my
bank’s bounced-check charges and a little for my aggravation.
If the buyer pays by check, be sure to hang on to the item until you are positive
that the check cleared and then ship the item. Call your bank to make sure that
you have not received a return deposit item for the amount of the check.
The item you send is busted — 
and so are you
Uh-oh! Could it be true? Could you have sent the wrong item? Or is it possible
that the crystal vase you thought you packed so well is a sad pile of shards at
the bottom of a torn box? If so, read Chapter 12 as soon as you take care of
this catastrophe so that you can get some hints on packing and insurance.
It’s time to do some serious problem solving. If the buyer met his or her end
of the deal, you need to do your best to fix the problem. Your communication
skills are your number-one asset in this situation, so get to work.
Picking up the pieces
No matter how carefully you pack an item, sometimes it arrives on the
buyer’s doorstep mangled, broken, or squashed. News of this unfortunate
event travels back to you fast. The buyer will let you know in about 30 sec-
onds how unhappy he or she is in an e-mail. (Sometimes they’re not very
polite, but keep your calm.) Tell the buyer to locate the insurance stamp or
paper tag that’s attached to the package as proof of insurance and then take
the whole mangled shebang back to his or her post office.
Here’s what happens at the post office:
 If the item is insured for less than $50, the buyer immediately gets a
Postal Service money order for the value of the item.
 If the item is insured for over $50, the buyer fills out a claim form, and
you’re contacted to fill out additional forms. You need to show your insur-
ance receipt to the good people at the post office. You have to wait 60 to
90 days for the paperwork to be processed before you actually get paid.
 Of course, the post office won’t refund the postage. Hey, they delivered
the item, didn’t they?
263
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

If a package is lost, you’ll know it because the delivery confirmation never
comes through, and the buyer tells you the package is a no-show. You need to
go the post office from which you sent the item to file for insurance. Then the
Postal Service checks around. If your item isn’t located in 30 days, it’s declared
lost, and there’s another round of paperwork and processing before you get
your money. And no, you don’t get a return on the postage either.
If you have private package insurance (discussed in Appendix B), the process
is considerably simpler. You don’t have to contact the shipper; you merely
have to contact the insurance company and place a claim.
Lots of eBay sellers seem to think that if a buyer doesn’t pay for insurance
and the package gets lost in transit, that it’s not the seller’s problem. They
couldn’t be more wrong. The Federal Trade Commission has a very strict rule
covering mail order merchandise delivery. The short version is that if your
item doesn’t get to the buyer within 30 days, you must refund the payment.
The long version can be found at the FTC Web site:
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/mailorder.htm
Boxed out of a claim
In my experience, neither UPS nor the U.S. Postal Service will pay on an insur-
ance claim if they feel you did a lousy job of packing. So, don’t be surprised if
your claim is declined. Always use good packing products, wrap carefully,
and get ready to plead your case.
Every shipping company has its own procedure for complaints. But here’s
the one thing they do have in common: No procedure is hassle-free. Call your
shipper as soon as a problem arises.
You have regrets — seller’s remorse
You’ve undoubtedly heard about buyer’s remorse. Here’s a new one for you —
seller’s remorse. If you’re selling your velvet Elvis footstool because your spouse
said, “It’s me or that footstool!” and then decide that your spouse should have
known how much you revered the King when you went to Graceland on your
honeymoon, you can end the auction. Read “Try canceling bids first” and “If all
else fails, end your auction early,” later in this chapter.
Auction Going Badly? Cut Your Losses
So your auction is cruising along just fine for a couple of days when you
notice that the same eBay user who didn’t pay up on a previous auction is
264
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

your current high bidder. You don’t want to get burned again, do you? Of
course not; cancel this deadbeat’s bid before it’s too late. Although canceling
bids — or, for that matter, entire auctions — isn’t easy (you have a load of
explaining to do, pardner), eBay does allow it.
If you feel you have to wash your hands of an auction that’s given you noth-
ing but grief, it doesn’t mean you have to lose money on the deal. Read on to
find out the protocol for dumping untrustworthy bidders or (as a last resort)
laying a bad auction to rest and beginning anew.
Many of these functions are also available from the Selling-Related Links area
on the left side of My eBay Selling page, by clicking the word More.
Try canceling bids first
Face the facts: This auction is fast becoming a big-time loser. You did your
very best, and things didn’t work out. Before you kill an auction completely,
see whether you can improve it by canceling bids first. Canceling a bid
removes a bidder from your auction, but the auction continues running.
When you cancel a bid, you need to provide an explanation, which goes on
record for all to see. You may have a million reasons for thinking your auction
is a bust, but eBay says your explanation had better be good. Here are some
eBay-approved reasons for canceling a bid (or even an entire auction):
 The high bidder informs you that he or she is retracting the bid.
 Despite your best efforts to determine who your high bidder is, you
can’t find out — and you get no response to your e-mails or phone calls.
 The bidder makes a dollar-amount mistake in the bid. (The bidder bids
$100 instead of $10.)
 You decide mid-auction that you can’t sell your item due to the fact that
it was sold in an outside venue — or the dog ate it. (You must cancel all
bids and end the listing in this instance.)
I can’t drive this point home hard enough: Explain why you’re canceling a 
bid, and your explanation had better be good. You can cancel any bid for any
reason you want, but if you can’t give a good explanation of why you did it,
you will be sorry. Citing past transaction problems with the current high
bidder is okay, but canceling a bidder who lives in Japan because you don’t
feel like shipping overseas after you said you’d ship internationally could
give your feedback history the aroma of week-old sushi.
265
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

To cancel a bid (starting from most eBay pages), do the following:
1. Click the My eBay link on the navigation bar.
2. In the Related Links area, click the More link.
You’re taken to the Selling Related Links page.
3. Click the Cancel Bids on my Item link.
You’ll now see the Canceling bids page, shown in Figure 13-5.
4. Enter the item number, and an explanation of why you’re canceling a
bid, as well as the User ID of the person whose bid you’re canceling.
5. Click the Cancel Bid button.
Be sure that you really want to cancel a bid before you click the Cancel
Bid button. Canceled bids can never be reinstated.
Canceling bids means you removed an individual bidder (or several bidders)
from your auction, but the auction itself continues running. If you want to
end the auction completely, read on.

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Blocking bidders
If you have a bidder who just doesn’t get the message and continually bids on
your auctions despite the fact you’ve e-mailed and told him or her not to, you
can block the bidder from ever participating in your auctions. You can create
a list of bidders to prevent them from bidding temporarily or permanently,
and you can edit the list at any time.
You can find the page from the same Selling Related Links page as described
in the preceding section. Only this time, click Block or Pre-Approve Bidders
and then create your list. Alternatively, you can go directly to this address:
pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/biddermanagement.html
eBay says that you can’t receive feedback on a transaction that wasn’t com-
pleted. So, if something in your gut says not to deal with a particular bidder,
then don’t.
If all else fails, end your auction early
If you put your auction up for a week and the next day your boss says you
have to go to China for a month or your landlord says you have to move out
immediately so that he can fumigate for a week, you can end your auction
early. But ending an auction early isn’t a decision to be taken lightly. You miss
all the last-minute bidding action.
eBay makes it clear that ending your auction early does not relieve you of the
obligation to sell this item to the highest bidder. To relieve your obligation,
you must first cancel all the bids and then end the auction. Of course, if no
one has bid, you have nothing to worry about.
When you cancel an auction, you have to write a short explanation (no more
than 80 characters) that appears on the bidding history section of your auc-
tion page. Anyone who bid on the item may e-mail you for a written explana-
tion. If bidders think your explanation doesn’t hold water, don’t be surprised
if you get some nasty e-mail.
Bidding on your own item is against the rules. Once upon a time, you could
cancel an auction by outbidding everyone on your own item and then ending
the auction. But some eBay users abused this privilege by bidding on their
own items merely to boost the sales price. Shame on them.
To end an auction early, go to the Selling-Related Links page (as described
earlier in the “Try canceling bids first” section) and click the End My Listing
Early link. Then follow these steps:
267
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

1. Enter the item number and then click Continue.
2. On the next page, shown in Figure 13-6, select a reason for ending
your auction.
3. Click the End Your Listing button.
An Ended Auction page appears.
eBay sends an End of Auction Confirmation e-mail to you and to the
highest bidder.
If you know when you list the item that you’ll be away when an auction ends,
let potential bidders know when you plan to contact them in your item
description. Bidders who are willing to wait will still be willing to bid. Alerting
them to your absence can save you from losing money if you have to cut your
auction short.
Extending your auction (not)
Is your auction red hot? Bids coming in fast and furious? Wish you could have
more time? Well, the answer is you can’t. eBay won’t extend auctions under
normal conditions.
However, eBay on occasion experiences hard outages. That’s when the
system goes offline and no one can place bids. (Of course, Murphy’s Law
would put the next hard outage right in the thick of a furious bidding war in
the final minutes of your auction. Or so it seems.) Outages can last anywhere
from five minutes to a few hours. Because so many bidders wait until the last
minute to bid, this can be a disaster. To make nice, eBay extends auctions by
24 hours if any of these three things happen:
Figure 13-6:
Select the
reason for
ending your
auction
early.
268
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

 The outage is unscheduled and lasts two hours or more.
 The auction was scheduled to end during the outage.
 The auction was scheduled to end one hour after the outage.
If your auction was set to end Thursday at 20:10:09 (remember, eBay uses mili-
tary time, based on Pacific Time — which would make it 8:10 p.m.), the new
ending time is Friday at 20:10:09. Same Bat-time, same Bat-channel, different day.
eBay also refunds all your auction fees for any hard outage that lasts more
than two hours. That means the Insertion Fee, Final Value Fee, and any
optional fees. You don’t have to apply for anything; eBay automatically
refunds the appropriate fees.
You can read about any hard outages at eBay’s System Status Announcement
Board. To get to an outage report, check the bottom of most eBay pages; you’ll
find an Announcements link that takes you to the General Announcements
Board. From there, click the eBay System Announcements Board link.
If the Announcements link isn’t there, start at the navigation bar (at the top of
most eBay pages) and do the following:
1. Click Community on the main navigation bar.
You’re taken to the Community Overview page.
2. In the News area, click the See All System Announcements link.
You go to the System Status Announcements Board.
Make it standard operating procedure to check both the General and the
System Announcements Boards when you feel something is amiss. Checking
the Announcements Boards is sort of like checking the obituaries in the
morning to make sure you’re not listed. You can find more on the Announce-
ments Boards in Chapter 17.
Filing for a Final Value Fee credit
Hard outages are not the only time you can collect a refund. If closing a suc-
cessful auction is the thrill of victory, finding out that your buyer is a non-
paying bidder or deadbeat is the agony of defeat. Adding insult to injury,
eBay still charges you a Final Value Fee even if the high bidder never sends
you a cent. But you can do something about it. You can file for a Final Value
Fee credit.
269
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

To qualify for a Final Value Fee credit, you must prove to eBay that one of the
following events occurred:
 The winning bidder never responded after numerous e-mail contacts.
 The winning bidder backed out of the sale.
 The winning bidder’s payment did not clear or was never received.
 The winning bidder returned the item to you, and you refunded the 
payment.
If both you and the buyer decide that it’s okay not to go through with the
transaction, that’s okay with eBay, too. eBay will allow you to get back your
Final Value Fee by going through the refund process. You’ll find an option in
the Reason for Refund area that will absolve the buyer of any wrongdoing
with eBay’s Unpaid Item police.
The instant you file for a Non-Paying Bidder Alert credit, eBay shoots off an
e-mail to the winner of your item (copying you on the e-mail) and warns the
eBay user of the non-paying bidder status.
If at least seven days and no more than 45 days have elapsed since the end of
the auction, you can apply for a full credit. First, you must first file a Unpaid
Item Alert:
1. Click the My eBay link on the navigation bar at the top of most eBay
pages.
You can report this in one of two ways.
2. At the bottom of your My eBay Views area, click the Dispute Console.
On the page that appears, click the Report an Unpaid Item link, or you
can save a step by clicking the Report an Unpaid Item in the Related
Links Area This will take you directly to the form.
You’re taken to the Report an Unpaid Item Dispute page.
3. Read all the current terms.
4. Type in the item number of the auction in question and then click the
Continue button.
The Unpaid Item Alert Form appears, as shown in Figure 13-7.
5. From the Reason for Unpaid Item Alert drop-down menu, select the
reason for your request. Then click the Submit button.
If your reason is that you and the buyer mutually agreed not to complete
the transaction, when you click Submit, you’re taken immediately to the
Final Value Fee Credit request page. In these instances, you don’t have to
wait for long.
270
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

After three non-payment warnings, eBay can boot a deadbeat from the site.
You and your non-paying bidder now have ten days to work out your prob-
lems. If you make no progress after seven days, you may file for your Final
Value Fee credit.
You need to wait at least seven days after the auction ends to file a Non-
Paying Bidder Alert and then seven days before you can apply for a Final
Value Fee credit. I think it’s jumping the gun to label someone a non-paying
bidder after only seven days — try to contact the bidder again unless the
bidder sends you a message about backing out (or you have good cause to
believe you’ve got a deadbeat on your hands). If you still want to file for your
Final Value Fee credit after seven days, do the following:
1. On your My eBay All Selling page there are two ways to get to this
area. Scroll down to the bottom of My eBay Views and click Dispute
Console, or scroll further to the Related Links and click Unpaid Item
Disputes.
You’re taken to your Dispute Console page.
2. Under the Unpaid Items heading, Find the transaction in question.
3. Click the View Dispute link under the Dispute Status column.
You’re now in the area where you may respond to any comments the
buyer has left regarding why he or she hasn’t yet paid for your item.
4. Enter your response to the buyer (if any) in the messages area and
click Submit Response or to get your Final Value Fee refund, click
Close Dispute.
5. Click the Close Dispute button on the bottom of the page.
You’re taken to the Credit Request Process Completed page, which con-
firms that your refund is being processed by eBay, as shown in Figure 13-8.

Bidder Alert.
271
Chapter 13: Troubleshooting Your Transaction

When your listing ends, you have up to 45 days after the auction closes to
request a credit. After 45 days, kiss your refund goodbye; eBay won’t process it.
Anyone caught applying for a refund on a successful item transaction can be
suspended or something worse — after all, this is a clear-cut case of fraud.
If you want to verify eBay’s accounting, grab your calculator and use Table 9-2
in Chapter 9 to check the math. (Why couldn’t I have had one of those in
high-school algebra class?)
Always print out a copy of any refund and credit requests you make. This
paper trail can help bail you out later if eBay asks for documentation.
Déjà vu — relisting your item
Despite all your best efforts, sometimes your auction ends with no bids or
bids that are not even close to your reserve price. Or maybe a buyer won
your auction, but the transaction didn’t go through. eBay takes pity on you
and offers you the chance to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all
over again.
The best way to improve your chances of selling a relisted item is by making
changes to the auction. eBay says the majority of the items put up for auction
sell. If you sell your item the second time around (in most cases), eBay rewards
you with a refund of your Insertion Fee. You receive your refund after at least
one billing cycle. Accept this refund as a reward for learning the ropes.
In the case of an unpaid item, you may (only in this situation) qualify for an
Insertion Fee credit by relisting the item. If the item sells the second time,
eBay will refund the Insertion Fee for relisting.

272
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

You must only use eBay’s Relist feature in order to receive the credit. Once the
item is filed as a UPI, you can use the Relist link on the unpaid item page or
1. Go to your My eBay All Selling page.
2. On the left side of the page in the All Selling column, click the
“Unsold” link.
You arrive at the page without Unsold Listings.
3. Click the Relist link next to the unpaid item.
To be eligible for a refund of your Insertion Fee, here’s the scoop:
 You must relist no more than 90 days after closing the original auction.
 You can get credit only if you got no bids in your original auction or if
the bids you got did not equal the reserve in your reserve-price auction.
 You can change anything about your auction item description, price,
duration, and minimum price, but you can’t sell a different item.
 If you set a reserve price in your original auction, you must set the same
reserve, lower it, or cancel the reserve altogether. If you set a higher or
add a reserve, you’re not eligible for a relisting credit.
eBay’s generosity has exceptions. It doesn’t offer refunds for any listing
options you paid for, such as bold lettering or use of Featured Plus!. Also,
Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions aren’t covered by this offer. And if you have a
deadbeat on your hands, you can relist, but you don’t get a return of your

But is she a natural blonde?
Here’s an example of an item that would have
made the seller a bundle if she’d done a little
more strategizing up front:
Platinum Mackie Barbie: Beautiful Platinum
Bob Mackie Barbie. MIB (removed from box
once only to scan). The doll comes with shoes,
stand, booklet, and Mackie drawing. The origi-
nal plastic protects her hair and earrings. Buyer
adds $10 for shipping and insurance. Payment
must be made within 10 days of auction by MO
or cashier’s check only.
The starting price was $9.99, and even though
the bidding went to $256, the seller’s reserve
price was not met, and the item didn’t sell. And
the Second Chance Offer didn’t bite.
When relisting this item, the seller should lower
the reserve price and add much more to the
description about the importance and rarity of
the doll (unless, of course, $256 was far below
what she wanted to make on the doll). Offering
to accept credit cards through PayPal would
have also helped her make the sale.

Insertion Fee. More bad news: If you don’t sell the item the second time
around, you’re stuck paying two Insertion Fees. So work a little harder this
time and give it your best shot!
To get your second shot at selling, do the following (from the Items I’m
Selling section of your My eBay Selling page):
1. Click the auction item listing that you want to relist.
You’re taken to the main auction page of that item.
2. Click the Relist Your Item link.
You’re taken to the Relist Your Item form — basically, the Sell Your Item
form with all the information filled in.
3. Make your changes to the auction, launch it, and pray!
Being as specific as possible with your item title improves your odds of being
profitable. If you’re selling an old Monopoly game, don’t just title it Old
Monopoly board game; call it Rare 1959 Monopoly Game Complete in Box.
For more information about listing items, see Chapter 10.
Here’s a list of ideas that you can use to improve your auction’s odds for 
success:
 Change the item category. See if the item sold better in another cate-
gory (see Chapter 3).
 Add a picture. If two identical items are up for auction at the same time,
the item with a photo gets more and higher bids. Zoom in on Chapter 14.
 Jazz up the title and description. Make it enticing and grab those
search engines. Breeze on over to Chapter 10.
 Set a lower minimum bid. The first bidders will think they’re getting a
bargain, and others will want a hot item. Mosey on over to Chapter 10.
 Set a lower reserve price or cancel the reserve. A reserve price often
scares away bidders who fear it’s too high. See (yup) Chapter 10 for
ways to make your reserve more palatable to prospective bidders.
 Offer more options for payment. People may pop for an impulse item if
they can put it on their credit card and pay for it later.
 Change the duration of the auction. Maybe you need some more time.
Go to (you guessed it) Chapter 10.
Long-time eBay veterans say that reducing or canceling your reserve price
makes your auction very attractive to buyers.

Using Pictures and Strategies

In This Chapter
 Attaching pictures to your auction
 Making picture-perfect images
 Using great photographic form
 Playing the links
 Letting others know all About Me
You may be enjoying most of what eBay has to offer, and you’re probably
having some good buying adventures. If you’re selling, you’re experienc-
ing the excitement of making money. But there’s more. Welcome to eBay, the
advanced class.
In this chapter, you go to the head of the class by discovering some insider
tips on how to enhance your auctions with images and spiffy text. Successful
eBay vendors know that pictures (also called images) really help sell items.
This chapter gives you the basics on how to create great images. I also give
you advice on linking pictures to your auctions so that buyers around the
world can view them.
Using Images in Your Auctions
Would you buy an item you couldn’t see? Most people won’t, especially if
they’re interested in purchasing items that they want to display — or clothes
they intend to wear. Without a picture, you can’t tell whether a seller’s idea of
good quality is anything like yours — or if the item is exactly what you’re
looking for.

Welcome to the cyberworld of imaging, where pictures aren’t called pictures,
but images and your monitor isn’t a monitor, but a display. With a digital camera
or a scanner and software, you can manipulate your images — spin, crop,
and color-correct — so that they grab viewers by the lapels. Even cooler:
When you’re happy with your creation, you can add it to your eBay auction
for others to see.
Sellers, take heed and read these other reasons why you should use your
own well-made digital images in your auction pages:
 If you don’t have a picture, potential bidders may wonder whether
you’re deliberately hiding the item from view because you know 
something is wrong with it. Paranoid? Maybe. Practical? You bet.
 Fickle bidders don’t even bother reading an item description if they
can’t see the item. Maybe they were traumatized in English class.
 Taking your own pictures shows that you actually have the item in your
possession. Many scam artists take images from a manufacturer’s Web
site to illustrate their bogus sales on eBay. Why risk being suspect?
Snap a quick picture!
 Everyone’s doing it. I hate to pressure you, but digital images are the
custom at eBay, so if you’re not using them, you’re not reaching the widest
possible number of people who would bid on your item. From that point
of view, you’re not doing the most you can to serve your potential cus-
tomers’ needs. Hey, fads are driven by conformity. You may as well use
them to your advantage.
So which is better for capturing images: digital cameras or digital scanners?
As with all gadgets, here’s the classic answer: It depends. For my money, it’s
hard to beat a digital camera. But before you go snag one, decide what kind
of investment (and how big) you plan to make in your eBay auctions. If you’re
already comfortable with 35mm camera equipment, don’t scrap it — scan
(or find a digital SLR)! The scoop on both of these alternatives is coming
right up.
Be sure to check with a camera store to see if older, traditional lenses can be
used on the digital SLR you buy. It’s often the case with the major brands,
although digital lenses don’t have to be as “good” as the old lenses were —
due to all the electronic manipulation that goes on inside the new cameras.
Next, go to eBay and see what kind of deals you can find on compatible
lenses.
Whether you buy new or used digital equipment at eBay, make sure it
comes with a warranty. If you don’t get a warranty, Murphy’s Law practically
ensures that your digital equipment will break the second time you use it.
276
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Choosing a digital camera
If price isn’t a factor, you should buy the highest-quality digital camera you
can afford, especially if you plan to use images with a lot of your eBay auc-
tions and the items you plan to sell vary in size and shape. By high-quality, I
don’t necessarily mean a camera with vast amounts of megapixels — I mean a
camera from a quality manufacturer that’s got a high optical zoom and has a
good (non-plastic) lens.
Sony, Canon, Kodak and Nikon all make good basic digital cameras. You can
find them for about $250 (easily found on eBay for even less). Middle-of-the-
road new (and quality used) digital cameras sell for between $100 and $150.
Compare prices at computer stores and in catalogs.
One of the most popular cameras used by eBay sellers was the Sony Mavica.
It came in two styles: the FD series used an everyday 31⁄2-inch floppy disk as its
memory; the CD series burns the images directly onto a rewritable mini-CD.
The reason for their popularity was simple: Just take your pictures, and then
pop out the floppy disk with the images and insert it into your computer.
The images are immediately accessible from your floppy drive. No fuss, no
muss — no cards to input, no software to install. The CD models are similar,
only you insert the CD in your CD drive. The files can be read off the disks
from the camera as normally. Unfortunately, most recent computers have
done away with the floppy disk drive. Yet surprisingly, these cameras are still
commanding a fairly high price on eBay because they have a good optical
zoom and are so easy to use.
A great place to buy digital cameras is (surprise!) eBay. Just do a search of
some popular manufacturers, such as Canon, Kodak, Sony, and Nikon, and
you will find pages of listings — both new and used digital cameras that you
can bid on — and, if you win, buy.
When shopping for a digital camera, look at the following features:
 Resolution: Look for a camera that has a resolution of at least 800×600
pixels. This isn’t hard to find because new cameras tout their strength in
megapixels (millions of pixels). You don’t need that high a resolution for
eBay because your pictures will ultimately be shown on a 72 dpi moni-
tor, not printed on paper. A pixel is a tiny dot of information that, when
grouped with other pixels, forms an image. The more pixels an image
has, the clearer and sharper the image is; the more memory the image
scarfs up, the slower it shows up on-screen. An 800-by-600-pixel resolu-
tion may seem paltry next to the 6-million-pixel punch of a high-end 
digital camera, but trust me: No one bidding on your auctions will ever
know the difference. And the picture will load a lot faster.
277
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits

 Optical Zoom. Here’s where the camera manufacturers try to pull the
wool over the consumer’s eyes. There sell cameras with an optical and a
digital zoom. The optical zoom is a true zoom done by the camera, the
lens, and its built in CCD (computer chip in cameras that converts light
into electronic data) — but a digital zoom is virtual; it’s interpolated
through software in the camera. That means it makes up data to fill in any
holes it doesn’t capture. You’ve seen this effect if you’ve ever tried to
enlarge a picture from the Web in a software program — it gets all blurry.
If you ever plan on shooting close-ups, look for a high quality optical
zoom.
 Storage type: Smart card? Secure Digital Card? CompactFlash card?
Memory stick? Floppy disk? (Whew.) The instructions that come with
your camera explain how to transfer images from your media type to
your computer. (No instructions? Check the manufacturer’s Web site.)
Most newer computers have ports into which you can insert your
camera’s memory cards — the computer can read the disk like it’s a
teeny, tiny disk drive.
If you plan to sell small or detailed items that require extreme close-ups
(such as jewelry, stamps, currency, coins, or Tibetan beads), you might
want a digital camera that lets you change lenses.
A more versatile way to get the best images of these items is to use a
super invention called a Cloud Dome. When photographing complex
items, no matter how good your camera is, you may find it difficult to
capture the item cleanly and exactly (especially the colors and bright-
ness of gems and metals). Your camera attaches to the top of this
Cloud Dome, and pictures are taken inside a translucent plastic dome.
The dome diffuses the light over the entire surface of the object to reveal
all the intricate details of the item. You can purchase Cloud Domes on
eBay or from the manufacturer’s Web site at www.clouddome.com.
Even in black and white, you can see the difference that a cloud dome
can make when taking pictures of jewelry, as shown Figure 14-1.

tures of

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

Choosing a scanner
If you plan to sell flat items such as autographs, stamps, books, or 
documents — or if you need a good piece of business equipment that can
double as a photocopier — consider getting a digital scanner. You can pick
up a brand new one for a under $100; you can also find scanners at eBay.
Here’s what you need to look for when you buy a scanner:
 Resolution: As with printers and photocopiers, the resolution of digital
scanning equipment is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The more dpi,
the greater the resolution.
Some scanners can provide resolutions as high as 12,800 dpi, which
looks awesome when you print the image, but to dress up your eBay
auctions, all you need is (are you ready?) 72 dpi (dots or pixels per
inch)! That’s it. Your images will look great — and won’t take up much
storage space on your computer’s hard drive. Basic scanners can scan
images at resolutions of up to 1,200 dpi, so even they are far more pow-
erful than you need for your eBay images.
 Flatbed: If you’re planning to use your scanner to scan pictures of doc-
uments (or even items in boxes), a flatbed scanner is your best bet.
Flatbeds work just like photocopiers. You simply lay your item or box
on the glass and scan away.
279
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits
How I’ve been shooting on eBay
I’ve been on eBay since 1996, so I’ve taken lots of
pictures to promote my online sales. I’m pretty
happy with the quality of most of my own images.
When I’ve sold paper ephemera, I usually just
lay the item on a scanner — and scan away. It’s
the best way to get a good image of that type of
item. I started early on with an Olympus camera,
but quickly changed to the Sony Mavica FD-73
(after seeing that my cohorts teaching at eBay
University all used that model). The FD-73 was
one of the first that had a 10X digital zoom,
which helps with intricate close-ups.
Then I upgraded to a used FD-92 with an 8X 
optical zoom (a newer model that added a
memory stick). And last year I purchased a Sony
DSC-H1 — a fancy 5-megapixel camera with a
12X zoom. To be perfectly honest, it’s way too
much camera for my eBay photo shoots. I still
use the FD-92 for most things. One excellent
improvement on my new camera is the addition
of image stabilization — it holds the camera
steady when I zoom in for ultra macro close-
ups. If you’ve ever taken a picture fully zoomed,
you know that the slightest breath can make the
resulting image a tad blurry. In the long run, a
nice balance between new technological gad-
gets and familiar, easy-to-use equipment is the
way to go.

Making Your Picture a Thing of Beauty
The idea behind using images in your auctions is to attract tons of potential
buyers. With that goal in mind, you should try to create the best-looking images
possible, no matter what kind of technology you’re using to capture them.
Get it on camera
Point-and-shoot may be okay for a group shot at some historical monument,
but illustrating your auction is a whole different idea. Whether you’re using a
traditional film camera (so you can scan your developed photographs later)
or a digital camera to capture your item, some basic photographic guidelines
can give you better results.
For more on using cameras and scanners, zoom ahead to the next section,
“Use traditional photos? Yes, I scan.” Then c’mon back to these dos and don’ts
to ensure that your digital image is a genuine enhancement to your auction:
 Do take the picture of your item outside, in daylight, whenever possible.
That way the camera can catch all possible details and color.
 Do forget about fancy backgrounds; they distract viewers from your
item. Put small items on a neutral-colored, nonreflective towel or cloth;
put larger items in front of a neutral-colored wall or curtain. You’ll cut
out almost all the background when you prepare the picture on your
computer. (This chapter explains how to prepare your picture.)
 Do use extra lighting. You can do this with your camera’s flash mode or
with extra photo lighting on stands. Use extra lighting even when you’re
taking the picture outside. The extra lighting acts as fill light — it adds
more light to the item, filling in some of the shadowed spots.
 Don’t get so close to the item that the additional light washes out (over-
exposes) the image. The easiest way to figure out the best distance is
by trial and error. Start close and keep moving farther away until you
get the results you want. This method can get pricey if you use film, but
that’s where digital cameras really shine: You can see the picture sec-
onds after you shoot it, keep it and modify it, erase it, and start again.
 Do take two or three acceptable versions of your image; you can pick
the best one later on your computer.
 Don’t use incandescent or fluorescent lighting to illuminate the photos
you plan to scan. Incandescent lighting tends to make items look yellow-
ish, and fluorescent lights lend a bluish tone to your photos. Some sellers
use GE Reveal incandescent bulbs; they throw a good-quality light which,
when combined with natural daylight, produces an even tone. My favorites
280
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

are the 5,000 degrees Kelvin full-spectrum bulbs. Yes, at $20 apiece they’re
very expensive — but with a 10,000-hour lifespan, they should have you
taking pictures into the next decade.
 If your item relies on detail (for example, an engraved signature or
detailed gold trim), do take a wide shot of the entire item — and then
take a close-up or two of the detailed areas that you want buyers to see.
 Do make sure that you focus the camera; nothing is worse than a blurry
picture. If your camera is a fixed-focus model (it can’t be adjusted), get
only as close as the manufacturer recommends. If you go beyond that
distance, the item appears out of focus. (Automatic-focus cameras mea-
sure the distance and change the lens setting as needed.)
Taking pictures of your item from different angles gives the prospective buyer
more information. When you have several images, use your photo-editing
program to put them in one composite image, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Some eBay creeps, whether out of laziness or deceit, steal images from other
eBay members. (They simply make a digital copy of the image and use it in
their own auctions. This is so uncool — because then the copied image doesn’t
represent the actual item being sold.) This pilfering has happened to me on
several occasions. To prevent picture-snatching, you can add your User ID to
all your photos. Then, the next time somebody lifts one of your pictures, it
has your name on it. If you’re familiar with adding HTML code to your auc-
tions, I offer a simple Java code on my Web site, www.coolebaytools.com,
that you can insert into your auction descriptions to prevent scurrilous users
from stealing your images.

Use traditional photos? Yes, I scan
If you use a scanner and traditional (that is, non-digital) camera to create
images for your eBay auction, you’ve come to the right place. (Also check out
the tips in the preceding section.) Here goes:
 If the photo processor will scan your images for you — be sure you get
that done. It will save you lots of time in scanning. If that’s not possible:
 Have the photo developer print your photos on glossy paper; it scans best.
 When you take traditional photos for scanning, get as close to your item
as your camera allows. Enlarging photos in the scanner will only result
in blurry (or, worse, jagged) images.
 Scan the box that the item came in, or if there’s a photo of the item on
the box, scan that portion of the box.
 If you’re scanning a three-dimensional item (such as a doll, jewelry item,
or box) and you can’t close the scanner lid, drape a black or white T-shirt
over the item after you place it on the scanner’s glass plate; that way
you get a clean background and good light reflection from the scanner.
 If you want to scan an item that’s too big to put on your scanner all at
once, scan the item in sections and assemble the digital pieces with your
image-editing software. The instructions that come with your software
should explain how to do this.
Software that adds the artist’s touch
After you take the picture (or scan it) and transfer it into your computer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, the next step is to edit the 
picture. Much like a book or magazine editor, you get to cut, fix, resize,
282
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 
Don’t forget your camcorder!
The majority of eBay users use either a digital
camera or scanner to dress up their auctions
with images, but some just use what they already
own — their handy-dandy camcorders! Yup,
after videotaping your day at the beach, point
your lens at that Victorian doll and shoot. With
the help of a video-capturing device, you can
create a still digital image right from the camera.

and reshape your picture until you think it’s good enough to be seen by
the public. If you’re a non-techie type, don’t get nervous — many of the 
programs have one-button magical corrections that make your pictures
look great.
The software program that comes with your digital camera or scanner puts at
your disposal an arsenal of editing tools that help you turn a basic image of
your item into something special. Although each program has its own collec-
tion of features, a few basic tools and techniques are common to all:
 Image quality: Enables you to enhance or correct colors, sharpen images,
remove dust spots, and increase or reduce brightness or contrast.
 Size: Reduces or increase the size or shape of the image.
 Orientation: Rotates the image left or right; flip it horizontally or 
vertically.
 Crop: Trims your picture to show the item, rather than extraneous 
background.
 Create an image format: Gives your edited picture a specific format,
such as .JPG, .GIF, or others when you save it. The best format for
putting photos on the Web (and thus the preferred format at eBay and
the one I strongly recommend) is .JPG (pronounced “JAY-peg”).
Every image-editing software program has its own system requirements and
capabilities. Study the software that comes with your camera or scanner. If
you feel the program is too complicated (or doesn’t give you the editing tools
you need), investigate some of the other popular programs. A simple-to-use
program called Fast Photos was developed by an eBay seller with us in mind.
It’s incredibly simple to use, and there’s not much of a learning curve involved.
It’s all click to change your image to picture-perfect form. I use it and love it
for its simplicity and speed — and it costs only $24.95 (you can get a free 
21-day trial at www.pixby.com/marshacollier.
If your camera didn’t come with software, you can purchase commercial
photo-editing software. The most widely used is the very complex Photoshop
and the pared down (but easier to use) Photoshop Elements; both are made
by Adobe. This is high-quality editing software, which you can easily pur-
chase on eBay for around $50.
Copying someone else’s auction text or images without permission can con-
stitute copyright infringement — which ends your auction and could get you
suspended from eBay.
283
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits

Making Your Images Web-Friendly
Because digital images are made up of pixels — and every pixel has a set of
instructions that has to be stored someplace — you have two difficulties
facing you right after you take the picture:
 Digital images contain computer instructions, so bigger pictures take up
more memory.
 Very large digital images take longer to build (appear) on the buyer’s
screen, and time can be precious in an auction.
To get around both these problems, think small. Here’s a checklist of tried-
and-true techniques for preparing your elegantly slender, fast-loading images
to display at eBay:
 Set your image resolution at 72 pixels per inch. You can do this with
the settings for your scanner. Although 72 ppi may seem like a low reso-
lution, it only nibbles computer memory (instead of chomping), shows
up fast on a buyer’s screen, and looks great at eBay.
 When using a digital camera, set the camera to no higher than the
800×600 format. That’s custom made for a monitor. You can always crop
the picture if it’s too large. You can even save the image at 640×480, and
it’ll display well on eBay — but it will take up less space, and you can
add more pictures!
 Make the finished image no larger than 480 pixels wide. When you
size your picture in your image software, it’s best to keep it no larger
than 300×300 pixels or 4 inches square, even if it’s a snapshot of a clas-
sic 4×4 monster truck. These dimensions are big enough for people to
see without squinting, and the details of your item show up nicely.
 Crop any unnecessary areas of the photo. You need to show your item
only; everything else is a waste.
 Use your software to darken or change the photo’s contrast. When the
image looks good on your computer screen, the image looks good on
your eBay auction page.
 Save your image as a .JPG file. When you finish editing your picture, save
it as a .JPG. (To do this, follow the instructions that come with your
software.) .JPG is the best format for eBay; it compresses information
into a small file that builds fast and reproduces nicely on the Internet.
 Check the total size of your image. After you save the image, check its
total size. If the size hovers around 40K (kilobytes) or smaller, eBay users
won’t have a hard time seeing the image in a reasonable amount of time.
 Reduce the size of your image if it’s larger than 50K. Small is fast, effi-
cient, and beautiful. Big is slow, sluggish, and dangerous. Impatient eBay
users will move on to the next listing if they have to wait to see your image.
284
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

The Image Is Perfect — Now What?
Now that your masterpiece is complete, you want to emblazon it on your 
auction for all the world to see. When most people first get the urge to
dazzle prospective buyers with a picture, they poke around the eBay site
looking for a place to put it. Trade secret: You’re not actually putting
pictures on eBay; you’re telling eBay’s servers where to find your picture
so that, like a good hunting dog, your auction points the buyers’ browsers
to the exact corner of the virtual universe where your picture is. That’s
why the picture has to load fast — it’s coming in from a different location.
(Yeah, it confused me in the beginning too, but now it makes perfect sense.
Uh-huh. Sure.)
To help eBay find your image, all you have to do is type its address into the
Picture URL box of the Sell Your Item form — so don’t forget to write down
the Web address (URL) of your image.
If you use eBay’s Picture Services, your photo will be at eBay’s servers and
will upload once, directly from your computer. I talk more about that in just
a minute.
You can highlight your image’s URL with your cursor, right-click your mouse,
and copy it to your computer’s Clipboard. Then go to the auction page you’re
filling out at eBay, put your cursor in the Picture URL window, and paste the
address into the box.
A typical address (for someone using AOL) looks something like this:
members.aol.com/ebay4dummy/rolexwatch.jpg
Because your image needs an address, you have to find it a good home
online. You have several options:
 Your ISP (Internet service provider): All the big ISPs — AOL, Comcast,
Road Runner, and Earthlink — give you space to store your Internet stuff.
You’re already paying for an ISP, so you can park pictures there at no
extra charge.
 An image-hosting Web site: Web sites that specialize in hosting pictures
are popping up all over the Internet. Some charge a small fee; others are
free. The upside here is that they’re easy to use.
 Your server: If you have your own server (those of you who do know
who you are), you can store those images right in your own home.
 eBay Picture Services: You can find out about using eBay’s photo-hosting
service later in this chapter.
285
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits

Using an ISP to store your images
Every ISP has its own rules and procedures. Go to the help area of your ISP for
directions on how to access your personal area and how to upload your images.
(No, I’m not getting naughty — those are authentic computerese phrases!)
After you’ve uploaded your images to your ISP, get the Web address of your
item’s location and type it into the Picture URL box of eBay’s Sell Your Item
page. Now the picture appears within the item description whenever some-
one views your auction page. Figure 14-3 shows you an auction description
with a picture.
Using image-hosting Web 
sites to store images
Okay, realistically, many people are combing cyberspace looking for the next
great thing. eBay’s success has entrepreneurs all over the globe coming up
with different kinds of auction-support businesses. As usual, a lot of junk
pops up on the Internet in the wake of such trends — but one promising
development caught my attention recently — image-hosting Web sites.
Image-hosting Web sites have changed from one-stop shops to mega-markets
loaded with tons of services for your auctions. Some image-hosting sites let
you post your pictures without requiring you to use their auction-management
software. Not that I think such software is a bad thing — it’s great! — I just like
to choose what I use. (Flip to Chapter 20 for more about auction-management
software.)

Here are a few convenient image-hosting sites that allow you to post a few of
your images for free:
 Auctiva (www.Auctiva.com)
 FreePictureHosting.com (www.freepicturehosting.com)
 Filmloop (www.filmloop.com) enables you to make slideshows from
all your eBay images. Take a look at my filmloop eBay store promotion
on my My Space page at www.myspace.com/marshacollier.
 Photobucket (www.photobucket.com)
Using eBay’s Picture Services
eBay hosts one image per auction — for free. If you want more images, it
costs only $0.15 to add additional pictures. (You can have a maximum of
12 images per auction item.)
287
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits
MSN TV — the easiest way to upload pictures
You can upload images to MSN TV so quickly and
easily that you may consider using it to upload
images to the Web even if you own a computer.
The restrictions? You must own (or borrow) a
camcorder and, oh yeah, have a user account
at MSN TV. 
Uploading images to MSN TV is simple. My low-
tech suggestions should get you through the
process:
1. Place all your items on a kitchen counter or
other flat, neutral surface, and start filming.
Consider placing the items on a white sheet
or towel to help create a background for the
items.
2. Pan your camcorder from one item to the
next, zoom in and out of each item, and
linger at the highlights of your collection.
Your camcorder’s auto-focus records qual-
ity images.
Don’t turn your camcorder vertically, or your
pictures will end up at eBay sideways. (And if
you’ve always wondered where those sideways
pictures came from, now you know.)
To load your images into your auction pages,
you need to join an image-hosting site that’s
MSN-TV-friendly. (Just search Google for MSN
TV image hosting and you’ll find lots of site to
use.) A popular image hosting site for MSN TV is
www.250free.com. After you log on and
register, just connect your camera to the MSN
TV box and follow the instructions provided by
the image-hosting service.

If you use this service, your photos appear on your auction in a predesigned
template. If you use more than one photo, the first photo shows up in a 
400-×-300-pixel format. A miniature of the first image appears to the left of
the larger image. The prospective bidder clicks the smaller picture, and it
magically appears in the larger photo area.
When you prepare to list an item for auction, a page appears, and you’re
asked whether you’d like to use the photo service. If you don’t want to use it,
click the Your Own Web Hosting tab and input the URL of your picture. If you
do want to use the service, follow the directions on-screen.
To post your photo, click the box, and an Open File dialog box appears.
Find your image on your computer and click Open, and the image magically
appears in the image box. Add more pictures if you want and click Submit
Pictures and Continue. Figure 14-4 shows the upload page — which is where
you upload your image from the Sell Your Item page. (If your upload on the
Sell Your Item page doesn’t look like this, click the link shown on the right to
go to Full Featured.) Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 eBay keeps an image online for the duration of your listing and for up
to 90 days (as long as you have the link available to access the page).
After that, the image disappears (unless you relist the same auction).
 You can always post the image again if you need it later; be sure to leave
a copy of the image on your computer.
 This feature doesn’t support the MSN TV platform.

Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

eBay’s Gallery
Any discussion of images on eBay would be incomplete without a short dis-
cussion of eBay’s Gallery pictures. Gallery pictures are the small pictures you
see next to items in category listings or in your searches. It’s obvious that
using eBay’s Gallery option draws more attention to your sales, but have you
ever noticed that not all Gallery images show up crisp and clear? And that
some are smaller than others? It’s not by chance; eBay reduces the same
image you uploaded for the Gallery.
The technology that allows eBay’s Picture Services to do its magic resizes
the seller’s picture to fit the allotted space. In the case of the Gallery, 
a considerable amount of compression is applied to your image. The more
compression that’s applied, the fuzzier and more distorted your image
can get.
When you use your own photo hosting on eBay, you can use a different photo
for your Gallery image. Either use a different picture or reduce your main
image to a tiny 110 x 120 pixels. If you reduce the picture yourself, you’ll
notice a big improvement in the way the Gallery picture looks.
289
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits
Multiple pictures in your descriptions
Here’s the answer to the most-asked question
when I teach a class on eBay. Many sellers
have more than one picture within the auction
description area. By putting extra images in the
description, they do not have to pay extra for
eBay’s hosting services. This isn’t magic; you
can easily do it, too. Just add a tiny bit of HTML
code in your auction description. Here is the
HTML code to insert one picture in your auction:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagename.jpg/>
Be sure to use the brackets to open and close
your code (they’re located above the comma and
the period on your keyboard). This code reflects
the URL of your picture and the coding img
src= to tell eBay’s server to insert a picture.
When you want to insert two pictures, just
insert code for each picture, one after the other.
If you want one picture to appear below the
other, use the HTML code for line break, <BR>.
Here’s how to write that:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagenumber1.jpg> <BR/>
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/
imagenumber2.jpg>

Getting Your Item Noticed
Okay, you’ve got a great auction at eBay and great images to go with it. Now
all you need to do is track the number of users peeking at your items and
attract even more people to your auction. Read the following sections to find
out how to make your auction even better.
Putting on the hits
Your auction is up and running at eBay, and you’re dying to know how many
people have stopped by to take a look. To easily monitor your auction’s hits
— the number of times visitors stop to look at the goods — you use a free
public counter program from an online source. A counter is a useful marketing
tool; for example, you can check the number of times people have looked at,
but not bid on, your auctions. If you have lots more lookie-loos than bids, you
may have a problem with your auction.
If your counter indicates you’re not getting many hits, consider the following
potential problems so you can resurrect your auction:
 Does the picture take too long to load?
 Is the opening bid too high?
 Are those neon-orange-and-lime-green bell-bottoms just too funky to sell?
Counters are available when you’re listing your item on the eBay Sell Your
Item form. You can also find some highly “intelligent” counters elsewhere on
the Net, at sites such as Sellathon.com.
Secret links for fun and profit
By linking to your eBay auctions from your personal or business Web page,
you can get even more people to look at what you’re selling. eBay has a very
specialized HTML that they will give you for free — the only thing is that very
few people know about it and it’s almost impossible to find on the eBay site.
But not to worry — to get a cool display on your Web page with your eBay
listings, do the following:
1. Go to
http://pages.ebay.com/api/merchantkit.html
You’re taken to the eBay Marketplace page.
2. Scroll down the page to and click the Get Merchant Kit Now button.
290
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

You’ll see the HTML Sniplet-generating page that will ask you a bunch of
basic questions. Answer to the best of your ability, because there really
are no wrong answers (besides, eBay lets you preview your work).
3. Customize by making your selections.
4. Click the Preview your Sniplet link.
5. Copy the handy HTML sniplet that eBay generated for you; then use
your computer’s Clipboard to paste it into your Web site or text editor.
Your eBay listings will now appear on your personal or business Web
page. Anyone who clicks one of the item links is transported directly to
your item listing.
At the time of this writing, when you hit the big time and open an eBay store,
eBay will give you 75 percent off your store’s Final Value fees when you bring
in a sale from off the eBay site.
The instant that you or another eBay user connects to a link that isn’t owned
or maintained by eBay, you’re no longer protected by the eBay rules and reg-
ulations. eBay cancels any auctions that contain links to Web sites that offer
to undersell an auction by touting the same item at a cheaper price — or
offer to sell items forbidden at eBay.
It’s against eBay policy to link to your Web site from your auction page, but
you can link from your About Me page (see the next section). To add a link to
your About Me page that takes eBay users to your Web site, type the follow-
ing HTML code at the end of your item description:
Click below...<br>
<a href=http://www.YourOwnISP.com/~yourUserID/sale.htm>
Visit my Web site</a>
It’s All About Me!
Want to know more about the people behind those User IDs? Thousands of
eBay members have created their own personal Web pages at eBay (called
About Me pages). About Me pages are easy to create — and are as unique as
each eBay member. eBay users with active About Me pages have a special ME
icon next to their User IDs.
Take your time when you create your About Me page. A well-done About Me
page improves your sales because people who come across your auctions
and check out your About Me page can get a sense of who you are and how
serious you are about your eBay activities. They see instantly that you’re no
fly-by-night seller.
291
Chapter 14: Using Pictures and Strategies to Increase Your Profits

Before you create your About Me page, I suggest that you look at what other
users have done. eBay members often include pictures, links to other Web sites
(including their personal or business home pages), and links to just about
any Web location that reflects their personalities — which is why they’re so
entertaining. If your purpose is to generate more business, I recommend that
you keep your About Me page focused on your auction listings, with a link
to your Web site.
Sellers with many auctions running at once often add a message to their
About Me pages that indicates that they’re willing to reduce shipping
charges if bidders also bid on their other auctions. This direct tactic may
lack nuance, but it increases the number of people who look at (and bid on)
your auctions.
To create your About Me page, do the following:
1. Go to any eBay user’s About Me page, scroll to the very bottom and
click the Create My About Me Page link. (If you can’t find the link, go
to: cgi3.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?AboutMeLogin.
You’re taken to About Me: Create Your Own eBay Personal Page.
2. If you haven’t signed in, type your User ID and password in the appro-
priate boxes.
3. Click the Edit Your Page button.
When you select the Use our easy Step-by-Step process; you’re taken to
the About Me layout page. You have three layout options, which eBay is
kind enough to show you:
• Two Column Layout
• Newspaper Layout
• Centered Layout
4. Click the button that corresponds to the layout option you want.
You’re taken to a second About Me creation page.
5. Enter the following information:
• Page Title: Type the title of your About Me page (for example,
Larry’s Lunchboxes).
• Paragraph 1: Type a personal attention-grabbing headline, such as
Welcome to Larry Lunch’s Lunchbox Place.
• Text: Type a short paragraph that greets your visitors (something
like, Hey, I like lunchboxes a lot — only more exciting).
• Paragraph 2: Type in another headline for the second paragraph of
the page, such as Vintage, Modern, Ancient, or I Collect All Kinds
of Lunchboxes.
292
Part III: Are You Selling What They’re Buying? 

• Text: Type in another paragraph about yourself or your collection
(such as, I used to stare at lunchboxes in the school cafeteria . . .
only more, you know, normal).
• Picture: If you’re adding a picture, type in a sentence describing it,
for example: This is my wife Loretta with our lunchbox collection.
• URL: Type in the Web site address (URL) where people can find
your picture. See the section earlier in this chapter that shows you
how to upload digital images.
• Feedback: Select how many of your feedback postings you want to
appear on your About Me page. (You can opt not to show any feed-
back, but I think you should put in a few comments, especially if
they’re complimentary, as in, “Larry sent my lunchbox promptly,
and it makes lunchtime a blast! Everybody stares at it. . . .”)
• Items for Sale: Select how many of your current auctions you want
to appear on your About Me page. If you don’t have any auctions
running at the moment, you can select the Show No Items option.
• Label: Type a caption to introduce your auctions, for example:
Lunchboxes I’m Currently Selling.
• Favorite Links: Type the names and URLs of any Web links you
want visitors to see, for example, a Web site that appraises lunch-
boxes (“It’s in excellent condition except for that petrified ham
sandwich. . . .”).
These text areas are shown in Figure 14-5.

6. Click the Back button, or, if you don’t like your current layout, click
the Continue button to go back to Step 1.
You’re now looking at your final About Me page.
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You see a group of buttons:
• Edit Some More: Returns you to Step 2.
• Save My Page: Saves your About Me page so that you’re one step
closer to publishing it at eBay.
• Edit Using HTML: If you know HTML code, you can customize your
About Me page. (For example, you can insert pictures with the
code I give you in the “Multiple pictures in your descriptions” 
sidebar, earlier in this chapter.)
• Start Over: Takes you to a link page where you can delete what
you created and begin again.
8. When you’re happy with your masterpiece, click the Save My Page
button.
Yes, you did it; now anybody in the world with access to the Internet can
now find your personal About Me page at eBay.
Don’t forget to update your About Me page often. A good About Me page
makes bidders eager to know more about your auctions. An out-of-date
About Me page turns off potential bidders. If you choose to update, you
need to edit it using HTML. If you don’t use HTML, you have to create a
whole new page.
You can link to your About Me page from your Web site or from your e-mail
because all About Me pages have their own personal URLs. The address ends
with your User ID. For example, here’s the URL for my page:

The irony of the Internet is that although you think you’re sitting at home
working anonymously, third parties such as advertisers and marketing com-
panies are secretly getting to know you. (All together now: Get-ting-to-know all
a-bout youuu. . . .)
While you’re busy collecting World’s Fair memorabilia and buying that hot new
Kate Spade purse, eBay is busy collecting nuggets of information about you.
eBay gets some of this information from you and some of it from your com-
puter. All the data eBay gets is stored in the mammoth eBay memory bank.

What you tell eBay
eBay gets much of what it knows about you from you. When you sign up, you
voluntarily tell eBay important and personal information about yourself.
Right off the bat, you give eBay these juicy tidbits:
 Name
 E-mail address
 Snail-mail address
 Phone number
 Your date of birth
 Password
“Okay, that’s no big deal,” you say, but if you’re using your credit card to
settle your eBay fees, you’re also giving out the following personal financial
information:
 Credit card number
 Expiration date
 Credit card billing address
 Credit card history
If you make a one-time payment with a personal check, register to pay by
check through PayPal, or apply for ID Verify (see Chapter 16 for more on ID
Verify), you give eBay even more information about yourself. eBay instantly
knows your bank’s name and your checking account number. The bottom line
is that every time you pay by check, you give away personal info about your-
self. eBay carefully locks up this information (in a high-tech Alcatraz, of sorts),
but other companies or individuals may not be so protective. Before you put
the check in the mail, make sure you’re comfortable with where it’s going.
What cookies gather
Web sites collect information about you by using cookies. No, they don’t
bribe you with oatmeal-raisin goodies. Cookies are nothing more than tiny
files that companies (such as eBay) put on your hard drive to store data
about your surfing habits.
Most Web site designers install cookies to help you navigate their sites.
Sometimes the cookie becomes sort of an “admission ticket” so that you
don’t need to register every time you log on.

Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

eBay has partnerships with companies that provide page-view and data-
tracking technology, and advertisers who display advertising banners on
eBay pages, whether you want to see the banners or not. If you click a
banner, a cookie from that particular advertiser may go onto your computer,
usually to prevent you from seeing it again.
Cookies can’t steal information from other files on your computer. A cookie
can access only the information that you provide to its Web site.
DoubleClick, a major player in the cookie-tracking field, says that it uses your
information to limit the number of times that you see the same advertise-
ment. DoubleClick also measures the kinds of ads that you respond to and
tracks which member Web sites you visit and how often. The bottom line is
that DoubleClick is just trying to sell you stuff with ads based on your per-
sonal interests. The upside is that you get to see stuff that you may like.
You can find out more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com/faq.
This site gives you simple instructions on how to handle cookies on your
computer.
If you want to keep your information private, you can remove yourself from
the DoubleClick cookie system by going to this Web site:

Your eBay sign-in cookie
When you visit eBay and sign in, eBay gives you a special kind of cookie —
not pecan shortbread — but an end-of-session or permanent cookie. There are
two types of cookies:
 End of session: This cookie type remains on your computer as long as
your browser is open. When you close your Internet browser (Internet
Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Opera) the cookie disappears as if you
downed it with icy cold milk.
 Permanent: This flavor is perfect if you don’t share your computer with
anyone else; it permits your computer to always remain signed in to a
particular Web site.
eBay’s “keep me signed in” sign-in cookie is a good thing. It prevents the
previously repetitive task of typing your User ID and password at every turn.
This cookie simplifies your participation in chats, bidding, watching items,
viewing e-mail addresses, and so on. Because you don’t have to sign in every
moment that you’re doing business on eBay, it’s a real time saver.

Web beacons
Web beacons are clear, 1-pixel-x-1-pixel images that are placed in the HTML
(or Internet page code) for individual pages. They are also commonly called
pixel tags. Web beacons, like cookies, are used mainly for collecting market-
ing information. They track the traffic patterns of users from one page to
another.
Web beacons are sneaky little things. They’re invisible as cookies, but they’re
incorporated into Web pages without your knowing. Turning off cookies
won’t disable them, but this action protects your anonymity. Web beacons
are not as ominous as they may seem because the information collected is
not personally identifiable, they just track your passage along the site.
What Web servers collect
Every time that you log on to the Internet, just like Hansel and Gretel you
leave an electronic trail of information. eBay, like zillions of other Web sites,
uses servers, which are immense programs that do nothing but collect and
transfer bits (and bytes) of information day and night. Your Internet connec-
tion has a special address that identifies you to all servers when you surf the
Net. This is called an IP (Internet Protocol) address and is often used to track
those whose shenanigans wreak havoc on Web sites or other users.
Web servers all over the Internet track some or all of the following information:
 What Web site you came in from
 The ISP (Internet service provider) that you use
 The Items that you’re selling on eBay
 The Web sites you linked your listings to
 Your favorite Web sites (if you link them to your About Me page)
eBay collects the following information while you visit the eBay site. After
you log off, the server discards the data:
 What you do while logged on to the site
 Which categories you tend to browse
 What times you log on and log off
Like incredible Internet archivists, eBay’s servers keep a record of everything
you bid on, win, and sell, which is great news if you have a problem with a
transaction and need eBay to investigate. Also, eBay couldn’t display feedback
300
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

about you and other users if its servers didn’t store all the feedback you write
and receive. Have you ever sent an e-mail to eBay? eBay’s servers record it and
keep it in some murky recess of eBay’s memory. Remember, we live in the age
of electronic commerce, and the people at eBay run a serious business that
depends on e-commerce. They have to keep everything in case they need it
later.
To see a chart on what personal information is accessible by third parties,
check out this address:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/privacy-appendix.html
Be sure to visit the page; you may be shocked by the amount of information
that exists on the eBay servers about you and your habits.

surf the Internet, visit this Web site:

Cookie removal-ware
I got a call from a friend who complained that her laptop computer was getting
slower and slower. She brought it over to my house and when I had a look at it,
I also noticed that it was opening extra windows and accessing the Internet
spuriously. After checking to see whether she had a virus (no, she didn’t), I
went to the Internet to get her spyware removal software. Perhaps her problem
was that too many people had inserted information-gathering cookies on her
computer.

Do seals bite back?
Because eBay pays to display the TRUSTe
mark, some online critics say that the seal is
nothing more than window dressing. These crit-
ics wonder whether it would be in the Web
watchdog’s best financial interest to bite the
hand that feeds it all those display fees. Critics
complain that the seal offers a false sense of
security — and suggest that you view the seal
as nothing more than a disclaimer to be careful
in your Internet dealings.
Technically, TRUSTe can pull its seal whenever a
Web site becomes careless in its handling of pri-
vacy issues. However, the critics make a good
point: Always be careful in your Internet dealings,
no matter how much protection a site has. If you
ever feel your personal information has been
compromised, file a complaint at the TRUSTe
Web site: www.truste.org/consumers/
watchdog_complaint.php.

That was certainly the case. After installing and running the software, I found
that she had over 350 cookies pulling information from her computer as she
surfed. Once deleted, her computer ran much faster.
She certainly didn’t give these people permission to spy on her comings
and goings on the Internet. These cookies were placed on her computer
without her knowledge. If you want to purge these uninvited spies from your
computer, download any of the free spyware or malware software from the
Internet. Two good free ones are Ad-aware from www.lavasoftusa.com/
software/adaware and Spybot Search and Destroy, available from www.
safer-networking.org/en/index.html.
If you’re apprehensive about all the information that Web servers can collect
about you while you innocently roam the Internet, I understand. But before
you start looking out for Big Brother watching over your shoulder, consider
this: On the Web, everybody’s collecting information.
The odds are excellent that all the information that eBay knows about you is
already in the hands of many other folks, too — your bank, your grocer, the
staffs of any magazines you subscribe to, clubs you belong to, any airlines
you’ve flown, and any insurance agencies you use. That’s life these days. And
if you’re thinking, “Just because everybody knows all this stuff about me, that
doesn’t make it right,” all I can say is, “You’re right.” But maybe you’ll sleep
better knowing that eBay is one place where folks take the privacy issue seri-
ously. See the next section for details.

Grateful Dead cookie jar
In 1999, an auction description read: “This is
one of the grooviest jars I have ever come
across — a real find for the die-hard Grateful
Dead fan or for the cookie jar collector who has
it all. Made by Vandor, this Grateful Dead bus
cookie jar looks like something the Dead would
drive. Beautiful detailing on the peace signs; the
roses are running lights. Painted windows. You
have just got to see this piece. Only 10,000
made, and I have only seen one other. Comes
with box that has Grateful Dead logos on it.
Buyer pays all shipping and insurance.”
The cookie jar started at $1 and sold at eBay for
$102.50. When I updated this book in 2002, it sold
on eBay for $125. The Grateful Dead’s bus cookie
jar is even more valuable these days; in 2004 an
auction just closed with the final bid at $150. The
price of the original has skyrocketed, so much so
that Vandor just came out with a 40th anniversary
replica. Buy it now for your Deadhead friends —
and buy it quick. Only 1,200 were made, and the
price is already edging up to the $100 mark.
Oh wow, dude — that’s some far-out cookie jar.
(Cue the band: Keep truckin’. . . .)

eBay’s privacy policy
eBay had a privacy policy for all its users before privacy policies were even
in vogue. Now eBay maintains the safety standards set forth by the pioneer in
online safeguarding: TRUSTe.
TRUSTe (www.truste.org) sets a list of standards that its member Web
sites have to follow to earn a “seal of approval.” The thousands of Web sites
that subscribe to this watchdog group must adhere to its guidelines and set
policies to protect privacy. eBay has been a member of TRUSTe since the pri-
vacy watchdog group was founded.
To review the policy that’s earned eBay the TRUSTe seal of approval, click the
Policies link that appears at the bottom of every eBay page.
In addition to setting and displaying a privacy policy, eBay follows these
guidelines as well:
 eBay must make its Privacy Policy links easily accessible to users. You
can find the logo on eBay’s home page. Click the Policies link. On the
eBay Policies page, click the Privacy Policy link and you’re taken to
the Privacy Policies page for more information. Take advantage of this
opportunity to find out how your data is being protected.
 eBay must disclose what personal information it collects and how it’s
using the info.
 Users must have an easy way to review the personal information that
eBay has about them.
 Users must have an option — opting out — that lets them decline to
share information.
 eBay must follow industry standards to make its Web site and database
secure so that hackers and nonmembers have no access to the informa-
tion. eBay uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is an encryption
program that scrambles data until it gets to eBay. Unfortunately, no
Web site, including the CIA’s Web site, is completely secure, so you
still have to be on your guard while you’re online.
What Does eBay Do with Information
about Me, Anyway?
Although eBay knows a good chunk of information about you, it puts the
information to good use. The fact that it knows so much about you actually
helps you in the long run.
303
Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve

Here’s what eBay uses personal information for:
 Upgrading eBay: Like most e-commerce companies, eBay tracks
members’ use and habits to improve the Web site. For instance, if a
particular item generates a lot of activity, eBay may add a category
or a subcategory.
 Clearing the way for transactions: If eBay didn’t collect personal infor-
mation such as your e-mail address, your snail-mail address, and your
phone number, after an auction was over, you couldn’t complete the
transaction you started. Bummer.
 Billing: You think it’s important to keep track of your merchandise and
money, don’t you? So does eBay. It uses your personal information to
keep an eye on your account and your paying habits — and on every-
body else’s. (Call it a gentle encouragement of honest trading habits.)
 Policing the site: Never forget that eBay tries to be tough on cyber
crime, and that if you break the rules or regulations, eBay will hunt you
down and boot you out. Personal information is used to find eBay delin-
quents, and eBay makes it clear that it cooperates with law enforcement
and with third parties whose merchandise you may be selling illegally.
For more about this topic, read up on the VeRO program in Chapter 9.
Periodically, eBay runs surveys asking specific questions about your use of
the site. It uses your answers to upgrade eBay. In addition, eBay asks whether
it can forward your information to a marketing firm. eBay says that it does
not forward any personally identifiable information, which means that any
info you provide is given to third parties as raw data. However, if you’re ner-
vous about privacy, I suggest that you make it clear that you don’t want your
comments to leave eBay should you decide to participate in eBay surveys. If
you don’t participate in the surveys, you won’t have any hand in creating
new eBay features, though, so you can’t complain if you don’t like how the
site looks. Sometimes, however, eBay advertises surveys that users can take
part in on the eBay home page.
What Do Other eBay Members
Know about Me?
eBay functions under the premise that eBay’s members are buying, selling,
working, and playing in an honest and open way. That means that anyone
surfing can immediately find out some limited information about you:
 Your User ID and history
 Your feedback history
304
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

 All the auctions and eBay store sales you run
 Your current bids and any bids you’ve made within a given 30-day period
eBay clearly states in its policies and guidelines that e-mail addresses should
be used only for eBay business. If you abuse this policy, you can be suspended
or even kicked off for good.
eBay provides limited eBay member registration information to its users. If
another member involved in a transaction with you wants to know the follow-
ing facts about you, they’re available:
 Your name (and business name if you have provided that information)
 Your e-mail address
 The city, state, and country that you provided to eBay
 The telephone number that you provided to eBay
Following the transaction, buyers and sellers exchange some real-world infor-
mation. As I explain in Chapters 6 and 12, members initiate the exchange of
merchandise and money by e-mail, providing personal addresses for both
payments and shipments. Make sure that you’re comfortable giving out your
home address. If you’re not, I explain alternatives in this chapter.
Spam — Not Just a Tasty Treat
Although you can find plenty of places to socialize and have fun at eBay,
when it comes to business, eBay is . . . well, all business.
eBay’s policy says that requests for registration information can be made
only for people with whom you’re transacting business on eBay. The contact
information request form requires that you type in the item number of the
transaction you’re involved in as well as the User ID of the person whose con-
tact info you want. If you’re not involved in a transaction, as a bidder or a
seller in the specified item number, you can’t access the user information.
When it comes to e-mail addresses, your secret is safe. If you bid on an auc-
tion, your e-mail is visible only to the seller. The end of listing notice contains
your e-mail address so that the person on the other end of the transaction
can contact you. After the other user has your e-mail address, eBay rules
state that the user can use it only for eBay business.
Here’s a list of “business” reasons for e-mail communication, generally
accepted by all at eBay:
 Responding to feedback that you left
 Responding to feedback that you received
305
Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve

 Communicating with sellers or buyers during and after transactions
 Suggesting to other eBay members items that buyers may be interested
in via the Mail This Auction to a Friend feature
 Leaving chat-room comments
 Discussing common interests with other members, such as shared
hometowns, interesting collections, and past or current auctions
Sending spam versus eating it
Sending e-mail to other members is a great way to do business and make
friends. But don’t cross the line into spam. Spam, a Hormel canned meat
product (I’ve given Spam its own sidebar), now has an alternate meaning.
When you spell it with a small s, spam is unsolicited e-mail — most often,
advertising — sent to multiple e-mail addresses gleaned from marketing
lists Eventually, it fills up your inbox the way “Spam, Spam, Spam, and Spam”
filled up the menu in an old Monty Python restaurant skit.
Think of spam as the electronic version of the junk mail that you get via the
U.S. Postal Service. Spam may be okay for eating (if you’re into that kind of
thing), but sending it can get you banned from eBay.
If you send an e-mail that advertises a product or service to people who
haven’t agreed (opted in) that they wanted this sort of e-mail, you’re guilty
of spamming.
Trashing your junk mail
Sometimes spam can come in the form of mail from people you know and
expect mail from. Your closest friend’s computer may have been abducted by
some weird Internet virus and replicated the virus to everyone in his or her
e-mail address book. Obviously, this is not a good thing for those who receive
and open the e-mail.
Don’t open e-mail from anyone you don’t know, especially if a file is attached
to it. Sometimes, if a spammer is really slick, it’s hard to tell that you’ve
received spam. If you receive an e-mail with no subject line, however — or if
the e-mail has an addressee name that isn’t yours, or is coming from some-
one you never heard of — delete it. You never know; it could be just annoying
spam — or worse, it could contain a computer virus as an attachment, just
waiting for you to open and activate it.
306
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

Speaking of e-mail, if you’re new to the technology, I recommend getting a
good antivirus program that can scan e-mail attachments and rid your
system of some annoying — and increasingly dangerous — computer bugs.
For some interesting general anti-spam tips, drop in at spam.abuse.net.
This Web site offers helpful advice for doing battle with spam artists. Also,
I’ve been using a very handy software program called MailWasher, which
allows me to preview my e-mail before it’s downloaded to my computer. It
even bounces spam back to the sender on command — as if your e-mail
address didn’t exist. Best of all, this program is free and available from
www.mailwasher.net.
E-mail spoofing
E-mail spoofing has become the bane of the online community and can really
wreak havoc. Spoofing is accomplished when crafty techno-geeks send out
e-mail and make it appear to come from someone other than themselves —
someone you know and expect e-mail from. Most often, this type of e-mail is
programmed to invade your privacy or, even worse, bilk you out of confiden-
tial information.
A spate of e-mails have purportedly been sent from eBay, PayPal, and
other major e-commerce sites, claiming that your membership has been
suspended — or that your records need updating. The opportunistic e-mail
then asks you to click a link to a page on the site, which then asks you to
input your personal information. Don’t do it!
307
Chapter 15: Privacy: To Protect and to Serve
Spam I am
Spam, the unwanted electronic junk mail, is
named after Spam, the canned meat product.
(Spam collectibles at eBay are another matter
entirely.) According to the Spam Web site
(www.spam.com), more than 6 billion cans of
Spam have been consumed worldwide. (By the
way, Hawaiians eat more Spam than any other
state in the union.) Spam is made from a secret
recipe of pork shoulder, ham, and special spices.
It was first produced in 1937 and got its name
from the SP for spice and the AM from ham.
It’s widely believed that spam (junk e-mail) got
its name from the old Monty Python sketch
because the refrain “Spam-Spam-Spam-Spam”
drowned out all other conversation and one of
the participants kept saying, “I don’t want any
Spam. I don’t like Spam.” Others say that it
came from a bunch of computer geeks at USC
who thought that junk e-mail was about as sat-
isfying as a Spam sandwich. Perhaps they’ve
never enjoyed a Spam luau in Hawaii under the
moonlight — aloha!

Most sites will never ask you to provide sensitive information through
e-mail, so don’t do it. If you receive an e-mail saying your “account has been
suspended,” close the e-mail and go directly to the site in question — without
using the supplied link in the e-mail. You’ll know soon enough if there is a
problem with your account.
If you get this sort of e-mail from eBay and want to confirm whether it is
really from eBay, visit this eBay security page:
pages.ebay.com/help/confidence/isgw-account-theft-spoof.
html
To help eBay in its investigation of these information thieves, send a copy of
the e-mail (along with all identification headers) to spoof@ebay.com. When
forwarding the e-mail, do not alter it in any way.
I Vant to Be Alone — and Vat
You Can Do to Stay That Vay
The Internet has a long reach. Don’t be surprised if you furnish your personal
information freely on one Web site, and it turns up somewhere else. If you
don’t mind people knowing things about you (your name, your hobbies,
where you live, and your phone number, for example), by all means share.
But I personally only think you should give only as much information as you
need to do business on the site.
308

My messages safeguard your privacy
Being the conscientious company it is, eBay
has set up a private area, accessible only
through your My eBay page, called My
Messages. (Find it on the left side of the page in
the long column of links.) My Messages enables
you to communicate with other eBay members
without revealing your e-mail address. All your
missives with other members, such as Ask the
Seller a Question communications, appear in
this area. You can answer, send new mail, and
delete communications from this area, just as if
it was your own e-mail software.
This service can protect you from most of the
most dangerous forms of spam. For safety’s
sake, whenever you receive an e-mail sent (in
reality or purportedly) from eBay or an eBay
member, don’t click the e-mail link to Respond
Now. Open your Internet browser and go
directly to your My Messages area. If the e-mail
is legitimate, it will appear here. Merely click the
e-mail to open it, read it, and reply. Your privacy
(in the form of your e-mail address) isn’t
exposed to the receiving party.

Privacy is not secrecy. Don’t feel obligated to reveal anything about yourself
that isn’t absolutely necessary. (Some personal facts are in the same league
as body weight — private, even if hardly a secret.)
Although you can’t prevent privacy leaks entirely, you can take some precau-
tions to protect yourself. Here are some tips to keep your online information
as safe and secure as possible:
 User ID: When eBay first started, members used their e-mail addresses
to buy and sell; today, users appear on the site with a nom de plume
(okay, User ID, but nom de plume sounds oh, so chic). Your first line of
defense against everyone who surfs the eBay site is to choose a User ID
that doesn’t reveal too much about you. Chapter 2 gives you some point-
ers on how to choose your User ID.
 Passwords: Guard your password as if it were the key to your home.
Don’t give any buyers or sellers your password. If a window requesting
your password pops up in an auction, skip it — it’s somebody who is up
to no good. Use your password only on official eBay screens. (See
Chapter 2 for tips on choosing passwords.)
If you’re concerned that someone may have your password, change it
immediately:
1. Go to your My eBay area and scroll down the links on the left
side of the screen and find the My Account area, and click the
Personal Information link.

Fighting back
Robbin was minding her own business, selling
software at eBay, when she ran into one of the
world’s nastiest eBay outlaws. He was a one-
stop-shopping outlet of rule-breaking behaviors.
First, he ruined her auctions by bidding ridicu-
lously high amounts and then retracting bids at
the last legal minute. He e-mailed her bidders,
offering the same item but cheaper. He con-
tacted Robbin’s winning bidders to say he was
accepting her payments. Then he started leav-
ing messages on her answering machine.
When she finally had enough, she contacted
Trust & Safety, which suspended him.
But like a bad lunch, he came back up — with a
new name. So Robbin fought back on her own.
She got his registration information and sent
him a letter. She also informed the support area
at his ISP about what he was doing, and
because he used his work e-mail address, she
also contacted his boss.
Her efforts must have done the trick. He finally
slipped out of eBay and slithered out of her life.
The lesson: Don’t rely completely on eBay to
pick up the pieces. If you’re being abused, stand
up for your rights and fight back through the
proper channels!

2. In the Personal Information area, scroll to Password, click the
Edit link, and follow the instructions.
Your password is immediately changed.
If your password has been changed by some dastardly evil-doer, and you
can’t sign in to your account, go to the eBay home page. On the eBay
home page (in the upper-right corner) is a Live Help link. Click there to
reach a live human being who can help you secure your account before
damage can be done.
 Credit card information: Whenever you use your credit card at eBay,
you can make sure that your private information is safe. Look for an
SSL (SSL stands for Security Sockets Layer) link or check box. Sometimes
you may see a link that says You may also sign in securely. This is an
encryption program that scrambles the information so that hackers
have almost no chance of getting your information. (I explain more
about SSL in Chapter 2.)
When buying from an auction that accepts credit cards, check the
seller’s feedback and carefully weigh the risks of giving your credit card
number to someone you don’t know versus the added time of paying by
money order or personal check. An even safer way to pay is through
PayPal, where your credit card number is not released.
Never give anyone your Social Security number online. Guard yours as if
it were your bank account number.
 Registration information: When you first register, eBay requests a phone
number and address for billing and contact purposes. I have never had a
problem with anyone requesting my registration information and then
misusing it. However, many people want an added measure of anonymity.
You can give eBay the information it wants in several ways without com-
promising your privacy:
• Instead of your home phone number, provide eBay with a cell
phone number, a work phone number, or a SkypeIn number. (See
Chapter 18 for more information on Skype.) Screen your calls with
an answering machine.
• Use a post office box instead of your home address.
• Start a bank account solely for eBay transactions. Make it a DBA
account — as in Doing Business As — so that you can use an alter-
nate name. Your bank can help you with this process.
 Chat rooms: eBay has a multitude of chat rooms where members
exchange information and sometimes heated arguments. (Chat rooms
are thoroughly discussed in Chapter 17.) But heed this advice: Be careful
what you reveal about yourself in a chat room. Don’t expect that “just
between us” means that at all. Chat rooms can be viewed by anyone who
visits the eBay site, not just eBay members.

Never say anything online that you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying to
the next person who passed you on the street. Basically, that’s who
you’re talking to. You can find stories of romances blossoming at eBay —
and I’m delighted for the happy couples, I swear — but come on, that
doesn’t mean that you should lose your head. Don’t give out any per-
sonal information to strangers; too often, that’s asking for trouble. Have
fun at eBay but hang on to your common sense.
Skim some of the category chat rooms, especially the Discuss eBay’s
Newest Features room, for warnings about security problems on the
chat rooms and boards — and how to avoid ’em. A great bunch of users
and eBay staffers frequent that board, and they’re sure to give you good
information.
 Check feedback: Yep, I sound like a broken record (in case you don’t
remember, records were the large, black, prone-to-breaking disks used by
people to play music before iPods and CDs were invented), but here it is
again: Check feedback. eBay works because it’s policed by its partici-
pants. The best way to learn about the folks whom you’re dealing with is
to see how others felt about them. If you take only one thing away from
this book, it’s to check feedback before you bid!
In the virtual world, as in the real world, cyberstalking is scary and illegal. If
you think someone is using information from eBay to harass you, contact
eBay immediately — as well as your local police. Chapter 16 gives you the ins
and outs of contacting eBay’s security team.

M
illions of people transact business every day on eBay. If you’re new
to the Internet, however, you may need a reality check. With around
89 million listings worldwide, and 6 million new listings every day, the law
of averages dictates that you’re bound to run into some rough seas eventu-
ally. If you do, know that you can get the answers you need from eBay’s
Trust & Safety Department. In this chapter, I take you through the Trust &
Safety resources — from reporting abuses to resolving insurance issues.
This chapter explains how eBay enforces its rules and regulations, shows
how you can use third-party bonding and mediation services, and even
points out how to go outside eBay for help if you run into some really 
big-time problems.
Keeping eBay Safe with Trust & Safety
Trust & Safety is the eBay area that focuses on protecting eBay buyers and
sellers from members who aren’t playing by the rules. Through this depart-
ment, eBay issues warnings and policy changes — and in some cases, it gives
eBay bad guys the heave-ho.
eBay’s Trust & Safety can be found by clicking the Community link in the nav-
igation bar. Scroll down the page to eBay’s Security & Resolution Center. (If
eBay ever moves this link, just type pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/
index.html into your browser and you’re there).

The Security & Resolution Center is more than just a link to policies and
information. It also connects you with a group of eBay staffers who handle
complaints, field incoming tips about possible infractions, and dole out warn-
ings and suspensions. These dedicated employees investigate infractions and
send out e-mails in response to tips. eBay staffers look at complaints on a
case-by-case basis, in the order they receive them. Most complaints they
receive are about these problems:
 Shill bidders (see the section on “Selling abuses” in this chapter)
 Feedback issues and abuses (see the section on “Feedback abuses” in
this chapter)
Keep in mind that eBay is a community of people, most of whom have never
met each other. No matter what you buy or sell at eBay, don’t expect eBay
transactions to be any safer than buying or selling from a complete stranger.
If you go in with this attitude, you can’t be disappointed.
If you’ve been reading previous chapters in this book, you probably know
about eBay’s rules and regulations. For a closer online look at them, click the
Policies link on the bottom of most eBay pages, and then check the User
Agreement. (The agreement is revised regularly, so check it often.)
Another helpful link is the FAQ for the User Agreement, which explains the
legalese in clearer English. To find it, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/everyone-ov.html
If you plan on being an active eBay member, it’s probably worth your while to
opt-in to receive eBay’s User Agreement update e-mail. Go to your My eBay
page and follow these steps.
1. Click the Preferences link under the My Account heading on the left
side of the screen.
2. Click the Show link.
This link is to right of the Legal and Policy Notifications heading.
3. Click to the right side of the User Agreement Changes area.
The Preferences link shows all the preference options. After you click
one of the Edit links, you’re prompted to sign in.
To go to the eBay Security & Resolution Center (see Figure 16-1) for tips on
current security issues on eBay, click the Security & Resolution Center link
that you can find at the bottom of most eBay pages.

Abuses You Should Report
to Trust & Safety
Before you even consider blowing the whistle on the guy who (gasp!) gave
you negative feedback by reporting him to Trust & Safety, make sure that
what you’re encountering is actually a misuse of eBay. Some behavior isn’t
nice (no argument there), but it also isn’t a violation of eBay rules — in which
case, eBay can’t do much about it. The following sections list the primary
reasons you may start Trust & Safety investigations.
Selling abuses
If you’re on eBay long enough, you’re bound to find an abuse of the service. It
may happen on an auction you’re bidding on, or a seller whose listings com-
pete with your auctions may do something really, really wrong. Be a good
community member and be on the lookout for the following:
 Shill bidding: A seller uses multiple User IDs to bid or has accomplices
place bids to boost the price of his or her auction items. eBay investiga-
tors look for six telltale signs, including a single bidder putting in a really
high bid, a bidder with really low feedback, but a really high number of
Figure 16-1:
The
Security &
Resolution
Center.
315
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

bids on items, a bidder with low feedback who has been an eBay member
for a while but who’s never won an auction, or excessive bids between
two users.
 Auction interception: An unscrupulous user, pretending to be the actual
seller, contacts the winner to set up terms of payment and shipping in an
effort to get the buyer’s payment. You can easily avoid this violation by
paying directly through the eBay site with PayPal.
 Fee avoidance: A user reports a lower-than-actual final price and/or ille-
gally submits a Final Value Fee credit. Final Value Fee credits are
explained in Chapter 13.
 Hot bid manipulation: A user, with the help of accomplices, enters
dozens of phony bids to make the auction appear to have a lot of bidding
action. Let the experts at eBay decide on this one; but you may wonder if
loads of bids come in rapid succession but the price moves very little.
Bidding abuses
If you want to know more about bidding in general, see Chapter 6. Here’s a
list of bidding abuses that eBay wants to know about:
 Bid shielding: Two users working in tandem: User A, with the help
of accomplices, intentionally bids an unreasonably high amount and
then retracts the bid prior to the 12-hour cancellation deadline of the
auction — leaving a lower bid (which the offender or an accomplice
places) as the winning bid.
 Bid siphoning: Users send e-mail to bidders of a current auction to offer
the same merchandise for a lower price elsewhere.
 Auction interference: Users warn other bidders through e-mail to stay
clear of a seller during a current auction, presumably to decrease the
number of bids and keep the prices low.
 Bid manipulation (or invalid bid retraction): A user bids a ridiculously
high amount, raising the next highest bidder to maximum bid. The
manipulator then retracts the bid and rebids slightly over the previous
high bidder’s maximum.
 Non-paying bidder: I often call them deadbeats; the bottom line is that
these people win auctions but never pay up. Your bid on eBay is a legal
contract to buy if you win, it is not a game.
 Unwelcome bidder: A user bids on a specific seller’s auction despite the
seller’s warning that he or she won’t accept that user’s bids (as in the
case of not selling internationally and receiving international bids). This
practice is impolite and obnoxious. If you want to bar specific bidders
from your auctions, you can exclude them. See Chapter 13 for the scoop
on how to block bidders.
316
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

Feedback abuses
All you have at eBay is your reputation, and that reputation is made up of
your Feedback history. eBay takes any violation of its Feedback system very
seriously. Because eBay’s feedback is now transaction-related, unscrupulous
eBay members now have less opportunity to take advantage of this system.
Here’s a checklist of feedback abuses that you should report to Trust &
Safety:
 Feedback extortion: A member threatens to post negative feedback if
another eBay member doesn’t follow through on some unwarranted
demand. Typical extortion attempts include demanding a refund or
demanding that you give a generous discount after the bad buyer has
won the item.
 Personal exposure: A member leaves feedback for a user that exposes
personal information that doesn’t relate to transactions at eBay.
 Malicious feedback: Writing malicious feedback is a sick game played
by those who have very little to do with their time but upset upstand-
ing eBay sellers. These sickies register on eBay with a new User ID and
use the Buy It Now function to buy many items from a seller who has
a high positive feedback rating. A few hours later, they leave dastardly
negative feedback. The only goal of this action is to ruin the seller’s
reputation.
 –4 Feedback: Any user reaching a Net Feedback score of –4 is subject to
suspension.
Identity abuses
Who you are at eBay is as important as what you sell (or buy). eBay monitors
the identities of its members closely — and asks that you report any great
pretenders in this area to Trust & Safety. Here’s a checklist of identity abuses:
 Identity misrepresentation: A user claims to be an eBay staff member
or another eBay user, or he or she registers under the name of another
user.
 False or missing contact information: A user deliberately registers with
fraudulent contact information or an invalid e-mail address. If you come
across someone on eBay who has false information registered on eBay,
that member can be suspended.
 Under age: A user falsely claims to be 18 or older. (You must be at least
18 to enter into a legally binding contract.)
317
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

 Dead/invalid e-mail addresses: When e-mails bounce repeatedly (single
bounces are almost a fact of life on the Internet) from a user’s registered
e-mail address, chances are good that it may be dead — and it’s doing
nobody any good. There’s usually return e-mail indicating that the
address is unknown.
 Contact information: One user publishes another user’s contact infor-
mation on the eBay site.
Operational abuses
If you see somebody trying to interfere with eBay’s operation, eBay staffers
want you to tell them about it. Here are two roguish operational abuses:
 Hacking: A user purposely interferes with eBay’s computer operations
(for example, by breaking into unauthorized files). If someone attempts
to alter any of the eBay-generated information in a listing, such as a feed-
back rating or User ID, the person is violating important eBay rules.
 Spamming: The user sends unsolicited e-mail to eBay users. Just
because you are in a transaction with someone doesn’t give you the
right to e-mail the person after the auction is over to solicit future busi-
ness. If you send a newsletter or solicitations, your recipients must have
opted in to your list. No one has the right to send you e-mail unrelated
to your transaction without your permission.
Miscellaneous abuses
The following are additional problems that you should alert eBay about:
 A user is threatening physical harm to another eBay member.
 A person uses racist, obscene, or harassing language in a public area
of eBay.
For a complete list of offenses and how eBay runs each investigation, go
to the following address: pages.ebay.com/help/tp/programs-
investigations.html.
Reporting Abuses to Trust & Safety
If you suspect someone of abusing eBay’s rules and regulations, go to the
Security & Resolution Center (you can find a link at the bottom of any eBay
page) and click the radio button next to the topic that best represents your
318
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

issue. After that, click the Report Problem link. After you click this link,
you’re presented with the Contact Us form, as shown in Figure 16-2. On this
page, several scrollable windows categorize violations by topic and subtopic.
Click the topic and subtopics that best represent the issue you’re reporting.
If you encounter any of the abuses outlined in this chapter, be sure to report
the problem. Community policing is what makes eBay work.
The Security & Resolution Center offers a wealth of good general information
that can help you prevent something from going wrong in a future transaction.
Be sure to use these pages regularly as a resource to help prevent problems.
If you’re involved in a troubled transaction and need to launch a report,
follow these steps:
1. Read all the information on the Investigations page (pages.ebay.
com/help/tp/programs-investigations.html) before filing a
new complaint.
2. Click any of the many informational links.
No matter which link you click, you’re taken to an area that instructs
you further and provides answers about what offenses eBay can and
cannot investigate.

Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

3. If you’ve found out that you have a legitimate case that should be
investigated, click the Contact Us link.
You’re taken to that handy form shown in Figure 16-2.
After clicking off the items that relate to your situation, click Continue.
eBay may present you with a page full of links to teach you about their
policies and some possible solutions to your issue. After reviewing
them, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Contact Support.
4. You’re now at the Trust & Safety Support Send Message form.
(Whew!)
Figure 16-3 shows you the form. Just type in the item number (or num-
bers if they are all part of a related problem) and give a thorough
description of what transpired if that information is requested.
Before you send your message to Support, be sure to review what you’ve
written to confirm that your report is accurate.
5. Send the report by clicking Submit.
Be sure you send only one report per case — and one case per report.
If you file a report, make your message clear and concise by including every-
thing that happened — but don’t editorialize. (Calling someone a “lowdown
mud-sucking cretin” may make you feel better, but it doesn’t provide any useful
info to anyone who can help you; it doesn’t make you seem un-cretin-like,
either.) Keep it businesslike — just the facts, ma’am. Do include all pertinent
documentation, such as e-mails, receipts, and canceled checks — and don’t
forget the transaction number.

320
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

Here’s a checklist of what you should include in your report to Trust & Safety:
 Write only the facts as you know them.
 Attach any pertinent e-mails with complete headers if required. (Headers
contain all the information that precedes an e-mail message.) Trust &
Safety uses the headers to verify how the e-mail was sent and to follow
the trail back to the originator of the message. See the sidebar, “Finding
the hidden headers in an e-mail message” to decipher this information.
 Be sure that the subject line of your report precisely names the violation.
If the clock is running out on your case (for example, you suspect bidding
offenses in a current auction), I suggest that you avail yourself of the Live
Help link that appears on the eBay home page.
After eBay receives your report via the Customer Service form, you usually get
an automatic response that your e-mail was received — although in practice,
several days may go crawling by before eBay actually investigates your allega-
tions. (The Customer Service Department must look at a lot of transactions.)
Depending on the outcome of the probe, eBay may contact you with the
results. If your problem becomes a legal matter, eBay may not let you know
what’s going on. The only indication you may get that some action was taken
is that the eBay member you reported is suspended — or NARU (Not A
Registered User).
If your complaint doesn’t warrant an investigation by the folks at Trust &
Safety, they pass it along to someone at the overworked Customer Support
staff, who then contacts you. (Don’t bawl out the person if the attention you
get is tardy.)
321
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program
Finding the hidden headers in an e-mail message
Most of the time, the headers in an e-mail mes-
sage are hidden by your e-mail program. If
you’re using Outlook Express (a free program
included with every Windows-enabled personal
computer), here’s how you find them.
1. Open an e-mail message by double-
clicking the Subject line.
2. In the open e-message, choose File➪
Properties.
The Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Details tab.
Bingo! The headers appear. Copy and paste
these into the eBay form whenever you
need to report any spurious e-mail.
This information is vital not just to eBay, but to
any online entity you might need to report an
e-mail abuse to.

Unfortunately, NARU members can show up again on the eBay site. Typically
nefarious sorts as these just use a different name. In fact, this practice is
fairly common, so beware! If you suspect that someone who broke the rules
once is back under another User ID, alert Trust & Safety. If you’re a seller, you
can refuse to accept bids from that person. If the person persists, alert
Customer Support with e-mail.
As eBay has grown, so has the number of complaints about slow response
from Customer Support. I don’t doubt that eBay staffers are doing their best.
Although slow response can get frustrating, avoid the temptation to initiate a
reporting blitzkrieg by sending reports over and over until eBay can’t ignore
you. This practice is risky at best and inconsiderate at worst, and it just
slows down the process for everyone — and won’t endear the e-mail bom-
bardier to the folks who could help. It’s better to just grin and bear it and
wait for action to be taken.
If you’re desperate for help, and can’t get satisfaction at the Live Help link,
you can post a message with your problem in one of the eBay chat rooms.
eBay members participating in chat rooms often share the names of helpful
staffers. Often you can find some eBay members who faced the same problem
(sometimes with the same member) and can offer advice — or at the very
least, compassion and a virtual ear. (Jump to Chapter 17 for more info on dis-
cussion boards and chat rooms.)
If you’re a PowerSeller, you can always contact PowerSeller support with
your immediate problem.
Make sure that you don’t violate any eBay rules by sharing any member’s
contact information as you share your story in a chat room. In addition, make
sure that you don’t threaten or libel (that is, say untrue things or spread
rumors about) the person in your posting.
For general, all-purpose help, eBay has a Customer Support e-mail response
form that will get you an answer within 12 to 36 hours. You can find Customer
Support creatively tucked away at
pages.ebay.com/help/contact_us/_base/index_selection.html
Stuff eBay Won’t Do Anything About
People are imperfect everywhere, even online. (Ya think?) You probably
won’t agree with some of the behavior that you run into at eBay (ranging
from slightly annoying to just plain rotten). Although much of that conduct is
detestable, it can (and does) go on as long as it doesn’t break eBay rules.
322
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

In some cases, you may need to bite your tongue and chalk up someone’s
annoying behavior to ignorance of the unwritten rules of eBay etiquette. Just
because people have computers and some things to sell or buy doesn’t mean
that they possess grown-up social skills. (But you knew that.)
Here’s a gang of annoying issues that crop up pretty regularly but that aren’t
against eBay’s rules and regulations:
 You receive unwarranted or retaliatory feedback. The biggest fear that
haunts members who consider leaving negative feedback is that the
recipient will retaliate with some more negative feedback. Remember
that you can respond to negative feedback. However, eBay won’t remove
a negative comment — no matter how unjustified you may think it is.
eBay has agreed that two parties can work through Mutual Feedback
Removal to remove feedback if both parties agree that the feedback was
left in haste and is unwarranted. See “Negative feedback can be
removed!” later in this chapter.
Often, people who leave retaliatory feedback are also breaking some
heftier eBay rules and (sooner or later) disappear from the site, never to
rant again.
 A seller sets astronomical shipping costs. eBay policy says that ship-
ping costs must be reasonable. Basically, eBay is wagging its finger and
saying, “Don’t gouge your buyers.” Some sellers are trying to avoid fees
or may be disappointed that a sale didn’t make enough money, so they
jack up shipping costs to increase their profit.
Under the rules, eBay will stop someone from charging excessive amounts
for shipping. For more information on eBay’s Excessive Shipping policy, go
to pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-shipping.html.
Bidders should always check shipping terms in the Item description.
Bidders must decide whether to agree to those terms before they bid.
The best way to protect yourself from being swindled is to agree with a
seller on shipping costs and terms in writing — before you bid.
 A seller or buyer refuses to meet the terms that you mutually set. eBay
has the power only to warn or suspend members. It can’t make anyone
do anything — even someone who’s violating a policy. If you want to
make someone fulfill a transaction, you’re more or less on your own.
I heard one story of a seller who refused to send a product after being
paid. The seller said, “Come and get it.” The buyer happened to be in
town on business and did just that!
Often, reluctant eBay users just need a nudge from eBay in the form of a
warning-to-comply. So go ahead and file a Final Value Fee credit request
(I explain how to do this in Chapter 13) and, if necessary, a fraud report
(more on fraud reports later in this chapter).
323
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

 An eBay member sends unwanted e-mail messages (spam). In fact,
members can send spam using eBay’s own tools. All the user has to do is
access the Contact a Member Form by clicking a member’s User ID. eBay
sees non-transaction–related communication as spam; you need to
report any member who abuses this system. Although the items spam-
mers are selling may be perfectly good, eBay won’t offer you any protec-
tion if you participate in “off-the-site” deals. I suggest that you ignore
these deals and avoid doing business with them in the future.
New eBay users are often the unwitting perpetrators of annoying behavior,
but you’re ahead of the pack now that you know what not to do. You can
afford to cut the other newbies some slack and help them learn the ropes
before you report them.
Using Mediation and Dispute
Resolution Services
Even the best of friends sometimes have misunderstandings that can escalate
to all-out war if they don’t resolve their problems early enough. If the going
gets tough, you need to call in the heavy artillery: a mediator. Just as pro
boxing has its referees, auctions may need a level head to intervene in any
squabble. eBay joins with SquareTrade, an online problem-solving service,
and the service is available through the eBay Web site (or directly at
www.squaretrade.com). Acting as a third party with no axe to grind, a
mediator such as SquareTrade can often hammer out an agreement or act as
judge to resolve disputes.
SquareTrade offers online sellers the opportunity to get a SquareTrade Seal
(like an online version of the Better Business Bureau) to post with your
auctions. The SquareTrade Seal represents that the seller is committed to
participating in online problem-solving, dedicated to superior customer ser-
vice, is in compliance with SquareTrade standards, and has been verified by
SquareTrade. Find out more about obtaining the SquareTrade Seal by going
to www.squaretrade.com.
Resolving a transaction dispute
If you file a complaint through the SquareTrade link, the service asks you to
supply information regarding the offending transaction on an online form.
SquareTrade then sends an e-mail to the offending party, outlining the situa-
tion. Both the complaint and the response from the other party appear on a
secure Web page that only the offender, the mediator, and you can access.
324
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

SquareTrade uses a patent-pending technology to help smooth the mediation
process. The mediator listens to both points of view and, if the parties can’t
reach an agreement, suggests a solution that he bases on the rules of fair play
and good conduct. The use of a mediator doesn’t, however, preclude the use
of a lawyer if things truly hit an impasse.
Negative feedback can be removed!
You may find yourself in a situation where you’ve received unjustified feed-
back (as in the case of the nervous Nellie who left a negative because the item
hadn’t arrived but it was just hung up in the mail). If the problem gets resolved
between the two of you, there is a way that you can get that feedback removed.
eBay has agreed to nullify the feedback if the two parties agree that the feed-
back was unwarranted, the feedback rating will be expunged from your record.
The comment will still appear in your member profile, but it will no longer
count toward your feedback score.
You must initiate your application for Mutual Feedback removal within 30 days
of either person leaving feedback or within 90 days of the transaction end date,
whichever is later. To file for this service, click the Community in the eBay
navigation bar. When you arrive on the Community page, go to the Feedback
Forum. On the Feedback Forum page, click the Feedback Disputes link. In
the middle of the page that pops up, you find the link for Mutual Feedback
Removal. Alternatively, save time by typing the URL below into your browser:

Walking the Plank: Knowing the Deeds
That Can Get You Suspended
Playing by eBay’s rules keeps you off the Trust & Safety radar screen. If you
start violating eBay policy, the company’s going to keep a close eye on you.
Depending on the infraction, eBay may be all over you like jelly on peanut
butter. Or you may safely lurk in the fringes until your feedback rating is
lower than the temperature in Nome in November.
Here’s a docket of eBay no-no’s that can get members flogged and 
keel-hauled — or at least suspended:
 Feedback rating of –4
 Three instances of deadbeat bidding with three different sellers
 Repeated warning for the same infraction
325
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

 Feedback extortion
 Bid shielding
 Unwelcome bidding after a warning from the seller
 Shill bidding
 Auction interception
 Fee avoidance
 Fraudulent selling
 Identity misrepresentation
 Bidding when younger than age 18
 Hacking
 Physical threats
If you get a suspension but think you’re innocent, respond directly to the
person who suspended you to plead your case. Reversals do occur. Don’t
broadcast your suspicions on chat boards. If you’re wrong, you may regret it.
Even if you’re right, it’s oh-so-gauche.
Be careful about accusing members of cheating. Unless you’re involved in a
transaction, you don’t know all the facts. Perry Mason moments are great on
television, but they’re fictional for a reason. In real life, drawing yourself into
a possible confrontation is senseless. Start the complaint process, keep it
businesslike, and let eBay’s staff figure out what’s going on.
Tossing a Life Saver: Getting
Buyer Protection
One thing’s for sure in this world: Nothing is for sure. That’s why insurance
companies exist. Several types of insurance are available for eBay users:
 Insurance that buyers purchase to cover shipping (see Chapter 12)
 eBay Standard Purchase Protection Program, which I discuss here
 eBay Motors Vehicle Protection Program
 SquareTrade Warranties
 PayPal’s Buyer Protection
326
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

To cover loss from fraud, eBay has several protection programs. The basic
eBay protection covers money that you pay for an item you never receive (as
a result of fraud, not shipping problems) or receive but find to be materially
different from the auction item’s description. eBay insurance pays up to $175
(a maximum of $200 coverage minus a $25 deductible) for a single claim. So if
you file a $50 claim, you get $25. If you file a $5,000 claim, you still get only
$175. (Hey, it’s better than nothing.)
Here’s the checklist to qualify for eBay protection:
 The buyer and seller must be in good standing (no negative feedback
ratings).
 The buyer must have proof that the item costs more than $25.
 The buyer must prove that the payment was sent.
 The buyer must prove that the seller didn’t send the item.
OR
 The buyer must prove that the item sent is substantially different
from the auction description.
To be eligible, you must register a complaint with the Fraud Reporting
System no sooner than 30 (and no later than 60) days after the auction
closes. eBay then e-mails the seller that a complaint has been lodged. eBay
hopes that by the time the 60 days are up, the differences are resolved, and
you can withdraw your complaint.
PayPal carries the protection even further, which is why I always advise
paying for your eBay items through PayPal (I won’t buy any other way). Find
out more on that in the following sections.
Extended warranties on electronics
eBay has teamed up with N.E.W. Customer Service Companies, a leading
provider of extended service plans, to offer buyers of new, refurbished, or
used electronics on eBay a 100-percent, one-year warranty. If you purchase
this extended warranty and your product breaks during the warranty period,
N.E.W. will repair it — parts and labor are 100-percent covered. If an item
requires more than three repairs, the “no-lemon” guarantee will replace the
item for free.
For more information on how this plan works, and how to purchase a policy,
go to
pages.ebay.com/help/warranty/buyer_overview.html
327
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

eBay Motors Vehicle Protection Program
Another beneficial eBay venture is eBay’s Vehicle Protection Program, which
offers a free limited warranty to anyone who purchases a car on eBay. Look
for the Vehicle Protection Program Shield at the bottom of the seller’s infor-
mation box to see whether the vehicle you’re interested in is covered.
Qualified cars are identified in the listing description in the Item Specifics
box, with the words Vehicle Protection Program up to $20,000.
Your vehicle purchase is protected for up to $20,000 or the vehicle purchase
price, whichever is lower. You can find more information at eBay Motors:
pages.motors.ebay.com/services/overview.html
PayPal Buyer Protection
Aside from safety, now PayPal offers an even better reason to pay through its
service. If you’ve purchased your item through a PayPal-verified seller, you’re
covered for your purchase for an additional $1,000. This protection covers
you only for non-delivery of tangible items and tangible items that are
received significantly not as described — not if you are disappointed with
the item. This insurance kicks in after you have filed for the eBay Standard
Purchase Protection Program and your item exceeds the $200 cap.
If you’ve paid with a credit card through PayPal, be sure to make a claim with
eBay first and then with PayPal. Do not make a claim with your credit card
company. PayPal Buyer Protection is for PayPal purchases, and you’re not
covered if you’ve made a claim with your credit card company.

Launching a Fraud Report
The second that you complain about a seller who’s taken money but hasn’t
delivered the goods, a Trust & Safety investigation automatically starts. To
file an initial Fraud Alert for misrepresented or non-delivered items prior to
eBay’s 30-day waiting period, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/confidence/programs-protection-on-ebay.

Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

and click the link to the eBay Standard Purchase Protection Program. Scroll
down the page to the Item Not Received or Significantly Not as Described
Process area and click the appropriate link to lodge your complaint.
To file a claim with eBay, you must initiate the complaint process no sooner
than 10 days, and no later than 60 days after the close of the listing. Be care-
ful not to jump the gun and register a complaint too soon. I suggest waiting
about two or three weeks before you register your complaint about an Item
Not Received (an item lost in the mail can often take as long as 30 days to
arrive); double-check first to make sure that your e-mail is working and that
you have the correct contact information of the person with whom you’re
having difficulties. After all, neither eBay nor your ISP is infallible.
Even if your claim isn’t worth a nickel after 90 days, you can still register a
fraud report and help the investigation of a lousy, terrible, allegedly fraudu-
lent eBay user. That’s payment enough, ain’t it?
After you register a complaint, eBay informs the other party that you’re
making a fraud claim. eBay says it will try to contact both parties and help
reach a resolution. Registering the complaint is not the same thing as filing an
insurance complaint. Registering starts the process; filing for insurance
comes after a month-long grace period if the situation isn’t resolved by then.
If you’ve clearly been ripped off, use the Item Not Received or Significantly
Not as Described process to file a complaint. Just scroll to the Links area at
the bottom of the page and click the Security & Resolution Center link.
For an Item Not Received or Significantly Not as Described, go directly to the
form at feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?InrCreateDispute.
If the accusation you’re registering is a clear violation, eBay gives you infor-
mation on the kind of third-party assistance you can get to help resolve the
problem. If eBay deems the problem a violation of the law, it reports the
crime to the appropriate law-enforcement agency.
Getting the Real Deal? Authentication
and Appraising
Despite eBay’s attempts to keep the buying and selling community honest,
some people just refuse to play nice. After the New York City Department of
Consumer Affairs launched an investigation into counterfeit sports memora-
bilia sold on the Web site, errant eBay outlaws experienced some anxious
moments. I can always hope they mend their ways, while at the same time
advising Don’t bet on it. Fortunately, eBay offers a proactive approach to pre-
venting such occurrences from happening again.
329
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

Topmost among the countermeasures is easy member access to several ser-
vices that can authenticate specific types of merchandise. The good news
here is that you know what kind of item you’re getting; the bad news is that,
as does everything else in life, it costs you money.
Have a good working knowledge of what you’re buying or selling. Before you
bid, do some homework and get more information. And check the seller’s or
bidder’s feedback. (Does this advice sound familiar?) See Chapters 5 and 9
for more information about conducting research.
Before you spend the money to have your item appraised and authenticated,
ask yourself a few practical questions (regardless of whether you’re buying
or selling):
 Is this item quality merchandise? Am I selling/buying merchandise
whose condition is subjective but important to its value — as in, Is it
really well-loved or just busted? Is this item graded by some profession-
ally accepted standard that I need to know?
 Is this item the real thing? Am I sure that I’m selling/buying a genuine
item? Do I need an expert to tell me whether it’s the real McCoy?
 Do I know the value of the merchandise? Do I have a good understand-
ing of what this item’s worth in the marketplace at this time, considering
its condition?
 Is the merchandise worth the price? Is the risk of selling/buying a coun-
terfeit, a fake, or an item I don’t completely understand worth the cost of
an appraisal?
If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider calling in a professional
appraiser.
As for selling a counterfeit item — otherwise known as a knock-off, phony, or
five-finger-discount item — that’s a no-brainer: No way. Don’t do it.
If you need items appraised, consider using an appraisal agency. You can
access several agencies by clicking the Seller Central/Resources link on the
Trust & Safety overview page (or you can visit pages.ebay.com/help/
community/auth-overview.html). eBay offers links to various appraising
agencies that offer their services at a discount to eBay members:
 The PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic
Guaranty Corporation) serves coin collectors. Visit www.pcgs.com and
www.ngccoin.com/ebay_ngcvalue.cfm.
 PSA/DNA (a service of Professional Sports Authenticators) and Online
Authentics.com authenticate your autographs. Both keep online data-
bases of thousands of certified autographs for you to compare your pur-
chases against. Their respective online addresses are www.psadna.com
and www.onlineauthentics.com.
330
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

 Global Authentication, Inc. Specialists in authenticating autographs
and memorabilia from the sports world. See gacard.net/ebay/
authmain.asp.
 PSE (Professional Stamp Experts) authenticates your postal stamps:
www.psestamp.com.
 CGC (Comics Guaranty) grades and restores comic books. Visit www.
cgccomics.com/ebay_comic_book_grading.cfm.
 IGI (International Gemological Institute) grades, authenticates, and iden-
tifies loose gemstones and jewelry. Visit www.e-igi.com/ebay.
 PSA (Professional Sports Authenticators) and SGC (Sportscard Guaranty)
help guard against counterfeiting and fraud with sports memorabilia and
trading cards. eBay has teamed up with these services to grade and
authentic trading cards. You can visit the respective addresses of these
agencies at www.psacard.com and www.sgccard.com/ebay/.
Even if you use an appraiser or an authentication service, do some legwork
yourself. Often, two experts can come up with wildly different opinions on
the same item. The more you know, the better the questions you can ask.
If a seller isn’t sure whether the item he or she is auctioning is authentic, you
may find an appropriate comment (such as Cannot verify authenticity) in the
item description. Knowledgeable eBay gurus always like to share what they
know, and I have no doubt that someone on the appropriate chat board may
be able to supply you with scads of helpful information. But be careful —
some blarney artist (one of those is born every minute, too) may try to make
a sucker out of you.
ID Verify
During the later years of the Cold War, Ronald Reagan said, “Trust but verify.”
The President’s advice made sense for dealing with the old Soviet Union, and
it makes good sense with your dealings at eBay, too! (Even if you’re not deal-
ing in nuclear warheads.)
To show other eBay members that you’re an honest type — and to get
special privileges when you’re a newbie at eBay, you can buy a “trust but
verify” option, known as ID Verify, from eBay for five bucks. The giant credit
verification service, VeriSign, verifies your identity by asking for your wallet
information, including the following:
 Name
 Address
 Phone number
331
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

 Social Security number
 Driver’s license information
 Date of birth
VeriSign matches the info you give to what’s in its database, and presents you
with a list of questions from your credit file that only you should know the
answer to. VeriSign may also ask you about any loans you have, (for example),
or what kinds of credit cards you own (and how many).
Becoming ID-Verified can be a bonus for new users. It allows you to bypass
some of eBay’s more stringent requirements for participating in higher-level
deals. By making sure that the community knows you’re really who you say
you are, you can get the green light for some higher-level activities:
 Run auctions with the Buy-It-Now option. Ordinarily you need a feed-
back rating of 10 to run a Buy-It-Now auction. This privilege may be
worth the price of the verification, but honestly, how hard is it really to
get your first ten feedbacks? Besides, the experience will be priceless.
 Open an eBay store. Although eBay requires a feedback rating of only
20 to open a store — I suggest you have much more. An eBay store (see
Chapter 11 for more information) requires a bit more eBay savvy than
the newbie seller can muster.
 Run fixed-price auctions offering multiple items (and Dutch auctions).
Ordinarily an eBay seller must have more than a 30 feedback rating to
perform this type of sale. I’ve spoken to several eBay veterans, and they
rarely participate in these types of sales.
 Bid on items over $15,000. Some form of verification is usually even
required of eBay’s old timers when bidding this high!
 Sell items in the Mature Audiences Category.
VeriSign sends only the results of its Identity Test to eBay (whether you pass
the test) and not the answers to the private financial questions it asks you.
VeriSign doesn’t modify or add the information you provide to any of its
databases.
VeriSign’s questions are meant to protect you against anyone else who may
come along and try to steal this information from you and assume your iden-
tity. The questions aren’t a credit check, and your creditworthiness is never
called into question. This info simply verifies that you are who you say you are.
If you pass the test and VeriSign can verify that you are who you say you are
(and not your evil twin), you get a cool icon by your name for a year. If, after
a year, you like the validation that comes from such verification, you can pay
another fee and renew your seal.
332
Part IV: Oy Vay, More eBay! Special Features 

Although you can feel secure knowing that a user who’s verified is indeed
who he or she claims to be, you still have no guarantee that he or she’s not
going to turn out to be a no-goodnik (or, for that matter, a well-meaning finan-
cial airhead) during auction transactions.
Even if an eBay member gets VeriSign verification, what makes this program
so controversial is twofold:
 Many members object to giving out Social Security numbers. They see it
as an unwarranted invasion of privacy.
 Some users also fear that this system creates a two-tiered eBay system,
with verified users occupying a sort of upper class and anyone who’s
not verified stuck in the lower class. They’re afraid that sellers may
refuse to do business with unverified users.
You should consider all of eBay’s current and future programs for protecting
you from problematic transactions and people, but I think the “undisputed
heavyweight champ” for finding out who someone really is (and keeping you
out of trouble) is the first program eBay created. That’s right, folks, feedback
can show you other eBay members’ track records and give you the best
information on whether you want to do business with them or take a pass.
Feedback is especially effective if you analyze it in conjunction with eBay’s
other protection programs. I suggest taking the time to read all about feed-
back in Chapter 4.
If It’s Clearly Fraud
After filing either a fraud report or a Final Value Fee credit request, you can
do more on your own. If the deal involves the post office in any way — if you
mail a check or the seller sends you merchandise that’s completely wrong
and refuses to make good — file a mail-fraud complaint with the postal
inspector.
In the United States, you can call your local post office or dial 800-275-8777
for a form to fill out. After you complete the form, the USPS sends the eBay
bad guy a notice that you’ve filed a fraud complaint. Perhaps that will get his
or her attention.
If you’re interested in learning about mail-fraud law, go to the following
Web site:
www.usps.com/websites/depart/inspect/usc18
333
Chapter 16: eBay’s Trust & Safety Program

In addition to the post office, you can turn to some other agencies for help:
 The National Fraud Information Center: NFIC has an online site devoted
to combating fraud on the Internet. NFIC works closely with legal authori-
ties. File a claim at www.fraud.org/info/repoform.htm or call toll
free at 800-876-7060.
 Law enforcement agencies: Contact the local district attorney (or state
Attorney General’s office) and the local and state Consumer Affairs
Department in the other person’s state and city. (Look online for contact
information or try your local agencies for contact numbers.)
 Federal Trade Commission: The FTC accepts complaints and investigates
repeated cases of fraud. File a claim at
rn.ftc.gov/dod/wsolcq$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU01
 Internet service provider: Contact the member’s ISP. You can get this
bit of info from the person’s e-mail address, just after the @ symbol.
(See? This easy access to information does have its advantages.) Let
the ISP know whom you have filed a complaint against, the nature of the
problem, and the agencies that you’ve contacted.
Any time you contact another agency for help, keep Trust & Safety up to date
on your progress by writing to its representatives the old-fashioned way.
Address your letter to eBay ATTN: Fraud Prevention, 2145 Hamilton Ave., San
Jose, CA 95125.
A very thin line separates alerting other members to a particular person’s
poor behavior and breaking an eBay cardinal rule by interfering with an
auction. Don’t make unfounded and/or vitriolic accusations — especially
if you were counting on them never to get back to the person they were
about (or, for that matter, if you hoped they would). Trample the poison
out of the gripes of wrath before you have your say. I recommend that you
hunt for facts, but don’t do any finger-pointing on public message boards
or chat rooms. If it turns out that you’re wrong, you can be sued for libel.
Communication and compromise are the keys to successful transactions. If
you have a difference of opinion, write a polite e-mail outlining your expecta-
tions and offer to settle any dispute by phone. See Chapters 12 and 13 for tips
on communicating after the auction ends — and solving disputes before they
turn wicked, aggressive, or unprintable.

The eBay Community: Joining In

In This Chapter
 Looking at announcements and other important messages
 Using eBay message boards
 Finding help when you need it
 Chatting it up
e
Bay is more than just an Internet location for buying and selling great
stuff. eBay wants the world to know that it has created (and works hard
to maintain) a community. It’s not a bad deal — prime real estate in this
community costs only pennies! As in real-life communities, you participate
as much as works for you. You can get involved in all sorts of neighborhood
activities, or you can just sit back, mind your own business, and watch the
world go by. eBay works exactly the same way.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the main ways to participate in the
eBay community is through feedback (which I explain in detail in Chapters 4
and 6). In this chapter, I show you some other ways to become part of the
community. You can socialize (making friends who live in your community
or who live across the planet), learn from other members, post messages, or
just read what everybody’s talking about on eBay’s discussion boards, groups,
chat boards, and the corporate Announcements Board. I include tips on how
to use all these places to your benefit, and then give you a change of scenery
by surfing through some off-site message boards that can help you with your
buying and selling.
On eBay’s navigation bar, there’s a clickable Community link. It’s a handy link
that connects you to the happenings on eBay; I use it regularly to check on
proposed changes to the site on the General Announcements page. But there’s
a whole lot more to the Community area of eBay. Take a little time to explore it
for yourself.

News and Chat, This and That
It’s not quite like The New York Times (“All the News That’s Fit to Print”), but
you can find all the news, chat boards, groups, and discussion boards links
from the Community Overview page. Figure 17-1 shows you what the page
looks like.
Here’s a list of all the main headings of the main Community page. Each head-
ing offers you links to the following specific eBay areas:
 Feedback: Find a handy link to the Feedback Forum. (More on feedback
in Chapters 4 and 6.)
 Connect: Click the links in this section to be whisked to eBay’s discus-
sion boards, groups, chat rooms, blogs, or the Answer Center.
 News: This area contains links to the Announcements page, which
covers general news, policy changes, technology updates, system
announcements, and more. You can also find links to eBay events,
including Town Hall meetings, eBay Radio and Online Workshops.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye! eBay’s
Announcements Boards
If you were living in the 1700s, you’d see a strangely dressed guy in a funny hat
ringing a bell and yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye!” every time you opened eBay’s
announcements boards. (Then again, if you were living in the 1700s, you’d
have no electricity, computers, fast food, or anything else you probably con-
sider fun.) In any case, eBay’s announcements boards are the most important
place to find out what’s going on (directly from the home office) on the Web
site. And no one even needs to ring a bell.
You have your choice of two boards. First, the General Announcements
Board, where eBay also lists any new features and policy changes. Visiting
this page is like reading your morning eBay newspaper because eBay adds
comments to this page almost every day. You find out about upcoming
changes in categories, new promotions, and eBay goings-on. eBay also uses
it to help users become aware of critical changes in policies and procedures.
Reach this page at www2.ebay.com/aw/marketing.shtml. Figure 17-2
shows you eBay’s General Announcements Board with information that
could affect your sales.
eBay also tips you off to the system status (should you wonder whether
the glitch is on your computer or on the eBay system). The System
Announcements Board at www2.ebay.com/aw/announce.shtml is
where eBay reports outages. eBay uses this board to update users on
glitches in the system and when those may be rectified.
I suggest a weekly (at least) stop at the Announcements Boards as a standard
part of your eBay routine.
eBay has close to 200 million members — a bigger population than some
countries — but it can still have that small-town feel through groups, chat
boards, and discussion boards. Start on the main Connect page by clicking
Community on the navigation bar. Then click the links. You can access more
than two dozen category-specific chats (although I’m not quite sure what’s
discussed in the Furbies Board these days), as well as a bunch of general
chats, discussion boards, and help discussion boards.
337
Chapter 17: The eBay Community: Joining In with Other eBay Members

Help! I Need Somebody
If you ever have specific eBay questions to which you need answers, several
eBay discussion boards on the Community: Connect page can help you. You
can also go directly to the chat rooms to pose your question to the eBay
members currently in residence.
Boards work differently than chat rooms. Chat rooms are full of people who
are hanging out talking to each other all at the same time, whereas users of
discussion boards tend to go in, leave a message or ask a question, and pop
out again. Also, in a discussion board, you need to start a thread by asking a
question. Title your thread with your question, and you’ll no doubt get a swift
answer to your query. Take a look at the Technical Issues Board in Figure 17-3.
Many questions can be answered by going to eBay’s Answer Center, which
you can get to by clicking the Answer Center link of the Connect area. You
then see boards covering almost any topic regarding selling and buying on
eBay. Just post your question and hopefully some kind eBay member will sug-
gest an answer (but remember to take that advice with a grain of salt, just as
you would any advice from someone with unknown credentials).

Rating the member chat rooms and boards
You know you need help, but you don’t know
which area is best for you. Here’s my take on
which boards are most helpful.
 Auction Listings: This discussion board is a
catchall for many subjects. If you don’t see a
board specific to your question (or if you post
to another board and get no reply), try this
one — it’s always hopping with lots of peeps.
 Photos/HTML Board and Images/HTML
Chat: Good help from other eBay members
for those with specific questions about using
HTML and posting pictures in your auctions.
 eBay Wiki: A wiki is an online area where
users can use their own expertise to answer
questions and provide information to the rest
of the online community. If their answers are
incorrect, or even a bit biased, other mem-
bers can sign in and add their own additions
and corrections. This makes a wiki possibly
the most accurate area for advice. Incorrect
information is quickly brushed aside and
replaced with newer and more accurate
data, so the content evolves as it’s being
fine-tuned and peer reviewed.
You can access a new board from any other
board by scrolling down the links list at the
top of each board page.

Community Chat Rooms
Because sending e-mail to eBay’s Customer Service people can be frustrat-
ingly slow if you need an answer right away (they get bombarded with a gazil-
lion questions a day), you may want to try for a faster answer by posting
your question on one of the Community discussion boards.
You can always tell if an eBay staff member is replying on a board because
the top border line of his or her post is in pink (not gray, as with regular
users). For this reason, they’ve earned the nickname “Pinks” on the boards.
Knowledgeable veteran eBay members or Customer Service “Pinks” (if they’re
around) generally answer posted questions as best (and as quickly) as they
can. The answers are the opinions of members and are certainly not eBay
gospel. But you get a fast and honest answer; often you get more than one
response. Most questions are answered in about 15 minutes. If not, repost
your question. Make sure that you post your question on the appropriate
board, because each board has a specific topic of discussion.
If a new policy or some sort of big change occurs, the boards are most likely
going to quickly fill with discussion about it. On slow days, however, you may
need to wade through endless personal messages and “chat” with no connec-
tion to eBay. Many of the people who post on these boards are long-time mem-
bers with histories (as well as feuds) that can rival any soap opera. On a rare
occasion, the personal postings can get rather nasty. Getting involved in per-
sonality clashes or verbal warfare gains nothing and wastes your valuable time.
One cardinal rule for eBay chat boards and message boards exists: no busi-
ness. No advertising items for sale! Not now. Not ever. eBay bans any repeat
offenders who break this rule from participating on these boards.
Remember that you’re visiting eBay and that you’re a member. It’s not
Speakers’ Corner — that spot in a London park where protesters are free to
stand on a soapbox and scream about the rats in government. If you feel the
need to viciously complain about eBay, take it outside, as the bar bouncers say.
User-to-User Discussion Boards
eBay has some other boards that take a different tack on things. They’re dis-
cussion boards as opposed to chat boards, which basically means that the
topics are deliberately open-ended — just as the topics of discussions in
coffee houses tend to vary depending on who happens to be in them at any
given time. Check out these areas and read ongoing discussions about eBay’s

latest buzz. It’s a lot of fun and good reading. Post your opinions to the cate-
gory that suits you. You can find tons of discussion boards on various topics
relating to doing business on eBay, but my favorites are in the General
Discussion area. Each discussion board carries as many topics as you can
imagine. Here are few of my favorites:
 The eBay Town Square is a potpourri of various subjects and topics.
 The Soapbox is the place to voice your views and suggestions to help
build a better eBay.
 NightOwls Nest is the fun locale for creatures of the night and their
unique postings. (As I’m writing this, for example, there’s a thread
with spirited advice to a Community Member who needs help with his
“gassy” cat.)
 eBay Live is a big eBay user convention. Stop by this board to get a
bird’s-eye view of the happenings from the previous year’s summit. You
can also find out what’s in store for the upcoming soiree.
 The Park is an interesting place where Community Members join in for
fun ideas and threads.
Other Chat Rooms (Message Boards)
About a dozen chat rooms at eBay specialize in everything from pure chat to
charity work. The following sections describe a few of these boards.
Café society
The eBay Café (eBay’s first message board from back when they were just
selling Pez candy dispensers) and AOL Café message boards attract mostly
regulars chatting about eBay gossip. Frequent postings include the sharing of
personal milestones and whatever else is on people’s minds. You can also
find useful information about eBay and warnings about potential scams here.
Holiday Board
Although eBay suggests that this is the place to share your favorite holiday
memories and thoughts, it’s really a friendly place where people meet and
chat about home and family. Stop by for cybermilk and cookies next time
you’ve got a few minutes and want to visit with your fellow auction addicts.
341
Chapter 17: The eBay Community: Joining In with Other eBay Members

Giving Board
eBay isn’t only about making money. On the Giving Board, it’s also about
making a difference. Members in need post their stories and requests for
assistance. Other members with items to donate post offers for everything
from school supplies to clothing on this board.
For information on how to participate, visit the Giving Board at chatboards.
ebay.com/chat.jsp?forum=1&thread=59. If you feel like doing a good deed
and conduct a member benefit auction click the eBay Giving Works link on the
Discussion Board page. For more on charity auctions see Chapter 18.
Emergency Contact Board
It’s no Rescue 911, but if your computer crashes and you lose all your info,
this board is the place to put out an all-points bulletin for help. If your ISP
goes on vacation, your Internet access is on the fritz, or you’re abducted by
aliens and can’t connect to your buyers or sellers, use a friend’s computer to
post a message on the Emergency Contact Board. There’s a dedicated group
of eBay users who frequent this board; they will try to help you by passing on
your e-mails to the intended parties. Talk about a bunch of givers!
The Emergency Contact Board can really be a tremendous help. A few years
ago, I saw a posting from a bidder saying that her computer had crashed and
that she was in the process of moving. She asked her sellers to be patient and
she would get to them as soon as possible. The friendly regulars of the
Emergency Contact Board looked up her bidding history and e-mailed the
sellers whose auctions she’d won in the previous week. Then they forwarded
her the e-mails they’d sent on her behalf. The sellers understood the situa-
tion and did not leave negative feedback for the user for lack of communica-
tion. Talk about community.
If you’re having trouble contacting another eBay member, posting for help
from other members to track ’em down often gets the job done.
If you think you may be the victim of a rip-off, check the Emergency Contact
Board. The buyer or seller may have left word about an e-mail problem. On
the flip side, you may find out that you’re not alone in trying to track down an
eBay delinquent who seems to have skipped town. Posting information about
a potentially bad eBay guy is (at the least) bad manners on most boards. If
you wrap it in the guise of an emergency contact, however, you can clue in
other members about a potential problem. Stick to the facts and make the
post as honest and useful as you can.

great for posting questions on items that you don’t know much about.
At eBay, you get all kinds of responses from all kinds of people. Take some of
the help you get with a grain of salt, because some of the folks who help you
may be buyers or competitors.

Chapter 17: The eBay Community: Joining In with Other eBay Members

Don’t be shy. As your second-grade teacher said, “No questions are dumb.”
Most eBay members love to share their knowledge of items.
eBay Groups
If you’re the friendly type and would like an instant group of new friends, I
suggest that you click the link in the Connect area to eBay Groups. Here you
can find thousands of user groups, hosted on eBay — but run by eBay com-
munity members. They may be groups consisting of people from the same
geographic area, those with similar hobbies, or those interested in buying or
selling in particular categories.
eBay Groups may be public (open to all) or private clubs with their own pri-
vate boards. Only invited members of the groups can access these boards.
Joining a group is easy: Just click any of the links on the main Groups page
and you’re presented with a dizzying array of groups to join. Your best bet
though, is to participate in chats or discussions, and find other members that
you’d like to join up with.
Blog It on eBay
A recent addition (along with the wiki) is eBay’s Blogs area. Here’s where any
eBay member can start his or her own online posting page. You can share your
opinions and ideas with the entire Internet universe, directly from eBay. I find
reading other members’ blogs a fun pastime; plus you get to learn a little more
about the faces behind the User IDs. Blogs do not replace the all-important
About Me page, but a blog can be fun to start, and fun for all your friends to
read.
Blogs are a fun and friendly pastime. Keep in mind, I said a pastime. If your
plan is to learn to sell on eBay, study this book and lots of PowerSeller list-
ings on the site. Go and list some test items rather than spending precious
moments playing here. But if time is not of the essence, have fun.

o one can say that eBay isn’t fun! The eBay staff is always trying to
work with the community by filling needs and finding fun stuff to keep
us happy. In this chapter, I show you how eBay members can get great inside
deals from manufacturers, and I open the door of The eBay Shop where you
can get T-shirts and coffee cups with the official eBay logo on them. I also
show you how you can help your favorite charity earn some well-deserved
cash at eBay’s charity auctions.
Over and over, eBay members show what big hearts they have. Yes, you actu-
ally can pocket some nice-sized profits from selling at the eBay Web site, but
(just as in real life) people usually take the time to give a little back for
worthy causes. But because we’re talking about eBay, giving back means
getting something fabulous in return.
Truly Righteous Stuff for Charity
Most of us have donated to charity in one form or another. But here at eBay,
charities really rock. Do you need a Jurassic Park helmet signed by Steven
Spielberg to round out your collection (and deflect the odd dino tooth)? Post
a bid on one of the charity auctions. How about a signed original photograph
of Jerry Seinfeld from People magazine? Yup, you can get that, too. All these
and more have turned up in charity auctions. In short, having a big heart for
charities has gotten a whole lot easier thanks to eBay.

eBay Giving Works
November 2003 was a lucky time for this country’s charities. That’s the month
that eBay launched the eBay Giving Works Charity auction area. Smartly, the
folks at eBay teamed up with one of the finest charity sites on the Internet,
MissionFish. MissionFish, a service of the Points of Light Foundation, has
been around since early 2000 and has enabled charities to raise hundreds
of thousands of dollars by turning in-kind donations into cash.
If you’re involved with a charity, you can register your charity to get on the
list of beneficiaries. You can also run your own fundraising events at eBay!
Just go to www.ebay.com/givingworks or click the Giving Works (Charity)
link on the left-hand side of the eBay home page.
The best part about this new system is that you can run an auction to benefit
your favorite charity. eBay sellers can list items for sale and designate those
items to benefit a charity from the MissionFish directory of thousands of chari-
ties. The seller can also specify what percentage (from as little as 10 up to 100
percent) of the auction proceeds go to the charity. At the end of the sale,
MissionFish e-mails a tax receipt to the seller. You can browse to select the
charity of your choice on the Giving Works page. When you list your item for
sale, you can indicate on the Sell form’s Create Your Listing section which char-
ity, and what percentage of the final sale price, you’d like to donate proceeds.
As you visit different areas of eBay, you can recognize the charity auctions by
the small blue ribbon icon next to them in searches and the Category list.

Auction for America
In late December 2001, eBay took on one of its
most ambitious attempts at fundraising: the
Auction for America. In responses to requests by
New York Governor George E. Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, eBay called on the community
to raise $100 million in 100 days. eBay and
Billpoint (eBay’s payment service at the time)
waived all fees, and community members gave
their all, donating and buying all kinds of items
benefiting the New York State World Trade
Center Relief Fund, the Twin Towers Fund, the
American Red Cross, and the September 11 Fund.
Community member Jay Leno sold his celebrity-
autographed Harley Davidson for over $360,260;
Tim Allen sold his 1956 Chevrolet Nomad for
$46,000; and countless corporate sponsors
joined in with the person-to-person community
to raise funds. Over 100,000 sellers participated,
and over 230,000 items were listed.
The auction ended on December 25, raising $10
million. This is an amazing tribute to the eBay
members and their community spirit.

Creative charity auctions
New charities are popping up all the time at eBay. To see what auctions it’s
running, go to the Charity page. To get there, start at eBay’s home page and
click the Giving Works (Charity) link on the left side of the screen. Here are
some of the more creative charity auctions that have been held at eBay:
 Oprah Winfrey has jumped onto eBay with a bang! To fund her charity,
the Angel Network, Oprah auctioned two chairs from her set. These were
not just any chairs. Aside from being luxurious leather chairs designed
by Ralph Lauren, they housed the behinds of famous names like John F.
Kennedy, Jr., Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, and Michael Jordan, to
name just a few. The 7-day auction netted the charity an amazing $64,100.
 To celebrate Chivas Regal’s 200th year, the company chose eBay
for CHIVAS 200, the largest online charity auction in the world. From
September 6 to October 31, 2001, the Chivas folks auctioned more
than 200 of the world’s most-wanted items and experiences — all for
the benefit of charity partners around the world. They auctioned items
such as an opportunity to become a Russian space station astronaut.
 In an annual eBay fundraising auction run by Kompolt & Company, bil-
lionaire Warren Buffet donated a private lunch to benefit the Glide
Foundation in New York for the winner and seven of the winner’s closest
friends. The 2006 auction grossed more than $620,000.
 When I appeared on The View with Barbara Walters and Star Jones, all four
stars of the show autographed a coffee cup that we auctioned off at eBay
to benefit UNICEF. We raised over $1,000 on a single coffee cup! Now that a
couple of the hosts have moved on, I wonder what that little cup’s worth.
If you go to the About Me page (by clicking the link from the Giving Works
page) of any of the charities on the Charity Fundraising page, you can find
out exactly where the money that eBay users bid goes. You can also get to
the charity auctions by going to pages.ebay.com/givingworks.
And Now for Our Feature Presentation
As an eBay member, you’re entitled to some features offered on the Web site.
The perks aren’t quite as high-end as you may receive with, say, a country
club membership, but hey, your non-existent membership dues are a lot less!
With about 203 million confirmed registered users, eBay can get outside com-
panies and manufacturers to listen to what it has to say. You know the old
saying about power in numbers? At eBay, you find “savings in numbers” on
items or services that you can buy outside the Web site.
The following sections explain some of the savings and other services you
can find at eBay.

Member specials
As eBay gains popularity, more and more outside companies are offering spe-
cial deals exclusively for members. These deals aren’t auctions but are con-
ventional “pay the price and get the item or services” transactions.
To find the member specials, go to the very bottom of eBay’s home page and
look for the business logos or link boxes at the bottom of the page. eBay also
has a page with most of the Power Trading features at pages.ebay.com/
services/buyandsell/member-specials.html.
The special deals change all the time, but here’s a small sampling of perks
available to you as a member:
 eBay Gift Certificates: WOW! It doesn’t get much better than this. Now I
never have to drag myself all over town looking for a gift. You can pur-
chase these certificates in any amount from $5.00 to $200.00. You can
print out the certificate and give it with a gift (I think my book, Santa
Shops on eBay, would make an excellent companion for an eBay gift cer-
tificate), or you can have it e-mailed to the recipient. You can also find
information at the secure site https://certificates.ebay.com/.
 PayPal: Online payments integrated directly into your eBay auctions.
 Authentication services: Get a special discount (usually 10 percent) if
you authenticate coins through Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS)
or trading cards through Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA). See
Chapter 16 for tips on authenticating your items.
As time passes, you can see additional benefits and programs that eBay
creates for the community. The folks at eBay are aggressively searching out
new and helpful affiliations to help you take care of your auction business.
But don’t leave the task of maintaining your listings entirely to eBay — take
it upon yourself to find new ways to make your listings easier to manage.
A successful seller takes advantage of every program and service he or she
can. The less time you spend tied to your computer, the more time you have
to plan new auctions and find new items to sell. Investigate these programs
and try them out for yourself.
Who’s minding the eBay Shop?
eBay’s minding the eBay store, of course (and freshening up its window-
dressing from time to time). If you can’t find the perfect item for your favorite
eBay member with more than 89 million listings (or so) worldwide running at
any given time, go browse around eBay’s General Store, eBay Gear. You don’t
find any auctions here — just eBay logo items, such as shirts, bags, coffee
mugs, and even an eBay holiday ornament!

To get to eBay’s online store, start at the home page. Scroll down to the very

then check out when you’re done. The store will ask you for specific billing
information, so keep your credit card handy.
eBay’s Favorite Searches e-mail service
If you’re too busy to explore the nooks and crannies of eBay on a daily basis
(or you’re the type who wants to cut to the chase), sign up for eBay’s per-
sonal shopper through your My eBay Favorite Searches.
This service is one of eBay’s better ideas. It enables you to find what you’re
looking for and still have a life, because it sifts through the new listings for
you 24 hours a day, looking for the items that meet your personalized
description. eBay sniffs ’em out like a bloodhound. Then eBay sends you an
e-mail containing a list of items that you may want to bid on, complete with
links that take you right to those items. Hey, best of all, the service is free!
To register for the personal shopper e-mail service, begin on the navigation
bar at the top of most eBay pages and follow these steps:
1. Type in keywords and perform a search using the Search box on the
top-right side of any eBay page.
The results of your search appear.
2. Click the Add to Favorite Searches link above the results.
You go to the Add to My Favorites page.
You have the option of simply adding the search, or deleting a search
and adding this search in its place. When you’re happy with the results,
click the link. The search appears in your Favorite Searches page.
3. Scroll down to the E-mail Preferences area, click the Receive a daily
e-mail box, and select the time period that you wish to receive the
e-mails.
Select the period of time (from 7 days to 12 months) you’d like to receive
the e-mails when items are listed.
4. Click the Save Search box.
5. The search is now added to your My eBay Favorite Searches page.
Go there to see a list of your current searches.
You may save up to 100 searches to be notified by e-mail. Yikes, don’t do
100! All you’ll get is e-mail from eBay!

Getting Free Calls over the 
Internet with Skype
eBay has purchased a new Internet-based communication service called
Skype (pronounced sky-yp). You can bet that in the near future, eBay will be
integrating the Skype technology with its other services. (Imagine the possi-
bilities!) You need to have a broadband Internet connection to use Skype, but
after you’ve got it, you can call other Skype users long distance for free.
Skype is controlled by software that you download to your computer. It
allows you to communicate with the rest of the world at no additional cost
(over the expense of your high-speed internet connection). To download the
software for PC, Mac, or Linux, just go to www.skype.com and click the
Download Skype link.
After you download the software, you can install the program with a click of
your mouse. Skype allows you to use your computer (along with a micro-
phone and your regular computer speakers) as a telephone. You can contact
anyone who is a member of Skype at no charge — wherever in the world they
reside or do business. (You can call regular phone numbers for a low, dis-
counted per-minute fee.) All Skype-to-Skype calls are free. As wonderful (and
simple) as that is, Skype has other revolutionary features that can really
expand your business:
 SkypeIn: I love this feature. With SkypeIn, you can purchase a special
phone number for your Skype computer so that people not set up with
Skype can contact you on your Skype account. The super part is that if
you live in Atlanta but you do a lot of business in, say, London, you can
get a local number in London so your London customers only have to
make a local call (without incurring long-distance charges) to reach you.
Unfortunately, SkypeIn doesn’t do anything about the time difference, so
you’ll still get calls from your British customers in the middle of the
night, but this feature does make your business look pretty big time —
you have a remote office across the Atlantic! You can get up to ten differ-
ent SkypeIn numbers.
 Skype Voicemail: If you’re not at your computer when another user
attempts to call you, your account can receive and store voicemail.
Voicemail is free when you purchase a SkypeIn telephone number. If you
purchase it separately, the annual cost is minimal.
 SkypeOut: You can call any number in the United States and Canada
(mobile or land line) for free. Skype has very reasonable charges for
calls made to foreign countries through SkypeOut. International charges
(per minute) can be very reasonable. For example: London, UK is $.021,
Japan $.023, France $.021. For a complete listing of international per
minute rates go to www.skype.com/products/skypeout/rates/
all_rates.html.

I recently got a Skype DualPhone. The DualPhone carries my office land line
as well as my Skype line wirelessly to anywhere I carry the phone. It plugs
into my computer with a USB connection to pick up my Skype calls, and a
phone line wire plugs in to the wall jack to access the land line. It also uses a
new technology that expands the strength and range of the wireless phone.
See Figure 18-1 to get a glimpse at my contacts.
My home was built after the Northridge, California, earthquake and it has a
good deal of steel in the structure to prevent it from collapsing. This struc-
tural element has precluded my using a wireless phone from one end of the
house to the other — until I got the DualPhone. Now I can access Skype and
get free long distance from anywhere in my home or office. (For more infor-
mation, check the Web site at www.dualphone.net.)
Skype is adding interesting features all the time. The PC version of the soft-
ware even allows for free video calls on your computer (assuming you have a
Web cam or other camera PC setup). You can also add a Skype button to your
e-mails, allowing your contacts to just click to call you.

o matter how much experience an airplane pilot may have, he always
keeps a checklist to go over. The same is true at eBay (although the
only crashing that you need to worry about is on your computer). No matter
how many times you buy, the advice in this chapter can help you survive and
thrive at eBay.
Although conducting business at eBay is relatively smooth overall, any ven-
ture is bound to have a few bumps here and there. There’s a certain etiquette
that goes along with everything we do in life. If you follow these simple rules,
your time on the site will be a whole lot more pleasant for everyone. That
said, here are ten (or so) easy, important golden rules for eBay. I note which
tips are geared toward buyers or sellers. Happy hunting and gathering!
After a while, posting auctions and bidding become rote. You can all too
easily forget the basics, so look at this chapter every now and again and
remember that, as an eBay member, you’re part of a very special person-to-
person community.

Buyer: Investigate Your Treasure
before You Buy
In the excitement of finding just what you want, you may develop a tendency
to leap before you look. Even if the item is closing soon, carefully read the
item description. Does the item have any flaws? Can you live with it? Is some-
thing missing from the description that should be there? Did you read the
terms of payment and shipping?
You can also communicate with the seller of the item that you’re longing for.
Don’t be too shy or embarrassed. If you have any questions, send an e-mail!
You’re better off covering your bases before you place a bid than facing dis-
appointment after making a purchase. Remember that when you click the bid
or buy button, you are legally and morally obligated to go through with the
transaction if you win. Make sure that everything is as you want it and check
for a warranty or return policy. Clarify everything upfront. If the seller doesn’t
answer back, consider that nonresponse an early warning that dealing with
this person may be a mistake!
Buyer: Check the Seller’s Feedback
Never bid without checking the seller’s feedback. You need to be able to trust
the person you’re buying from. Don’t just evaluate the Feedback percentage:
Investigate the seller’s feedback by clicking the number next to his or her
User ID. Be sure to read the comments left by other users. Checking some of
the seller’s other listings, past and present, to get an idea of the seller’s his-
tory also can’t hurt. As badly as you may want something, sending a payment
to someone with a high feedback rating but who recently got a bunch of nega-
tives could be risky business.
Buyer: Understand Post-Auction Charges
and Payment Methods
Before you bid on an item, make sure that you and the seller have similar ideas
on the shipping and handling, insurance, and escrow fees (if applicable — see
Chapter 6). Buying a $10 item and finding out that shipping and handling are
going to cost more than your winning bid is a real bummer. Don’t forget to
ask about any “handling charges.”
356
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Also, make sure that you and the seller can agree on the form of payment
before the deal closes. Is the seller willing to accept a personal check? Are
you willing to wait to receive your purchase until a check clears? Is credit
card payment available? Is the seller using a secure method of accepting
credit cards like PayPal?
Buyer: Check the Item Price Tag
and Bid Wisely
Before you bid, make sure that you have some knowledge of the item, even if
you limit your search to completed auctions to get an idea of how much the
item went for in the past.
If a deal sounds too good to be true, it may well be.
I love eBay — but not for every single thing that I buy. Make sure that you
can’t get the item cheaper at the store or from another online seller.
Beware of getting caught up in the frenzy of last-minute bidding: It’s an easy
thing to do. Whether you choose proxy bidding or sniping (see Chapter 7 for
my discussion on sniping), decide how much you’re willing to pay before bid-
ding. If you set a limit, you aren’t overcome with the urge to spend more than
an item is worth — or, worse, more than you have in your bank account.
Although eBay is lots of fun, it’s also serious business. Bidding is a legal and
binding contract. Don’t get a bad reputation by retracting bids or becoming a
deadbeat.
Buyer: Be a Good Buyer Bee
Always leave feedback after you put the finishing touches on a transaction.
Leaving feedback, and thereby helping other members, is your responsibility.
Remember your manners, too, when sending off your payment. You like to be
paid on time, right? And, speaking practically, the sooner you send in the
dough, the sooner you get your stuff.
Keep in mind that the transaction isn’t complete until the buyer receives the
merchandise and is happy with the purchase. Don’t automatically expect pos-
itive feedback because you paid for your item in a timely manner.
357
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Golden Rules for eBay Buyers and Sellers 

Buyer: Cover Your Assets
Remember that just because you’re conducting transactions from the privacy
of your home doesn’t mean that you’re doing everything you can to protect
your privacy. Legitimate buyers and sellers never need to know your pass-
word or Social Security number. Do not respond to this sort of e-mail. See
Chapter 15 about how to handle this sort of e-mail.
Seller: Know Your Stuff
Do some homework. Know the value of your item. At the very least, get an
idea of your item’s value by searching completed listings for similar items. If
it’s a new item, check out other online sites and see what your item is selling
for by running a Google/Froogle search at www.froogle.com. Knowing your
product also means that you can accurately describe what you have and
never, ever pass off a fake as the real McCoy. Make sure that your item isn’t
prohibited, illegal, questionable, or infringing. It’s your responsibility!
Before posting your listing, you should take the following actions:
 Establish what kinds of payment you’re willing to accept.
 Set your check-holding policy (usually seven to ten business days).
 Spell out your shipping and handling charges.
Add each of the preceding pieces of info to your item’s description to avoid
any unnecessary disputes later on.
Seller: Polish and Shine
Make sure that your title is descriptive enough to catch the eye of someone
browsing a category and detailed enough for eBay’s search engine to identify.
Don’t just write 1960s Board Game. Instead, give some details: Tiny Tim
Vintage ’60s Board Game MIB. That gets ’em tiptoeing to your auction.
Play editor and scrutinize your text for grammar mistakes and misspellings.
Typos in either your title or description can cost you money. For example, a
search engine will keep skipping over your Mikky Mouce Cokie Jare. Spelling
counts — and pays. Double-check your work!
358
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Seller: Picture-Perfect Facts
Photos can be a boon or a bust at eBay. Double-check the photo of your item
before you post it. Is the lighting okay? Does the photo paint a flattering image
of the item? Crop out unnecessary backgrounds. Would you buy this item?
Take your picture as if you didn’t have a description; be sure it totally illus-
trates the item. Also, write your description as if you didn’t have a photo.
That way if the photo server crashes, the prospective buyer will have a good
idea of what you’re selling.
Be factual and honest. At eBay, all you have is your reputation, so don’t jeop-
ardize it by lying about your item or terms. Tell potential buyers about any
flaws. Give as complete a description as possible, with all the facts about the
item that you can include.
Seller: Communication Is Key
Respond quickly and honestly to all questions sent via the My eBay My
Messages page and use the contact to establish a good relationship. Don’t let
more than 24 hours pass without sending a response. If a bidder makes a rea-
sonable request about payment or shipping, going along with that request is
usually worth it to make a sale. Note: The customer is always right! (Well,
some of the time, anyway.)
Be upfront and fair when charging for sending merchandise to your buyer.
You don’t make a fortune overcharging for shipping and handling. (Besides,
charging outrageous handling fees is a violation of eBay’s policies and could
get you suspended from the site.) After the item arrives, the buyer may real-
ize what it costs to ship. Unreasonable charges inevitably lead to bad feelings
and negative feedback.
Seller: Be a Buyer’s Dream
Just because you’re transacting through the computer doesn’t mean that
you can forget your manners. Live by the golden rule: Do unto others as you
would have others do unto you. Contact the buyer within three business
days — within 24 hours is even better. (Better yet, why not ship the item that
quickly? I do.) And keep all your correspondence polite.
359
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Golden Rules for eBay Buyers and Sellers 

Ship the goods as soon as you can (in accordance with the shipping terms
you outline in the item description, of course). An e-mail stating that the item
is on its way is always a nice touch, too. That way, buyers can eagerly antici-
pate the arrival of their goods.
And, when shipping your items, use quality packing materials and sturdy
boxes to prevent disaster. Broken or damaged items can lead to reputation-
damaging, negative feedback. Pack as if someone’s out to destroy your pack-
age (or as if you had made this purchase). Your buyers are sure to appreciate
the effort.
Seller: Listen to the Music
As I state in the golden rules for buyers, don’t underestimate the power of
positive feedback. Your reputation is at stake. Always generously dole out
feedback when you complete a transaction. Your buyers will appreciate it
and should return the favor. What should you do if you get slammed unfairly
with negative feedback? Don’t freak out! Don’t retaliate. Do, however, post a
response to the feedback by using the Respond to Feedback link on your My
eBay page. Those who read your feedback can often see past a single disgrun-
tled message.
Keep in mind that many negative feedback reports result from misunder-
standings. Contact the buyer and see if you can work things out to your satis-
faction. Then apply for a Mutual Feedback Removal to keep your eBay
reputation pristine.
Buyers and Sellers: Keep Current,
Keep Cool
You’d be surprised at the number of users who get suspended even though
they have automatic credit card payment. Maybe they move. Or their e-mail
address changes because they change Internet service providers. Regardless,
if you don’t update your contact and credit card information, and eBay and
other users can’t contact you as a result, you can be suspended.
If you make any major moves (home address, billing address, ISP provider),
let eBay know this new contact information. As soon as you know your new
credit card number, your mailing address, e-mail address, or contact phone
number, click My eBay on the main navigation bar and scroll down to links on
the left side of the page to My eBay Preferences: Personal Information and
update the appropriate information.

Need to slip in a bid in the middle of the night without losing sleep? If so,
here’s a list of ten (or so) software programs and services to make your bid-

As online auctions grow in popularity, software developers are constantly
upgrading and developing new auction software to meet eBay’s changes.
Many of these programs even look for new versions of themselves — and
update themselves as you start them. (Aladdin never had things so good.)
You don’t have to use any of these programs or services to run an eBay auc-
tion successfully. When you’re running more than several auctions a week,
the addition of a “helper” makes things go ever so much smoother.
A massive amount of companies out there are offering online management
service and offline programs. I can’t cover them all, so the software that I
mention in this chapter has been tried and tested by me. You may know of

others, and I’d love to hear about them. I do know that these work and are
good tools when you choose to expand your eBay sales.
Listed in this chapter are several auction-management Web sites. Each site
has its own distinct personality. I also provide the names of some terrific
offline software programs you can use to help manage your auctions, make
your e-auctions elegant and eye-catching, find the best prices, and snatch up
that bargain at the last minute.
Be sure to check my Web site www.coolebaytools.com for updates on
software and services, as well as special discounts that are offered to my
readers.
Online Services
You’re comfortable transacting your auctions online, so why not manage
them online as well? These sites offer incredibly useful services that save
time in both posting your auctions and wrapping them up.
Auctiva
If you’re new on eBay and you’d like to try a little automation to get you
started, Auctiva is your entry-level choice. First, let me tell you my favorite
part about Auctiva: It’s free. That’s right, FREE (my favorite four-letter word).
Now, I always say you get what you pay for, but with Auctiva you get a bit
more than that.
The service is run on Class A servers, just like the big guys. That means that
you’re not going to be worrying about a lot of downtime for your images.
Auctiva has been serving eBay sellers since my first edition of eBay For
Dummies in 1999. Auctiva gives small merchants the power of large compa-
nies by helping them build their brands, merchandise their products, and sell
efficiently through eBay. This is the only completely free and simple solution
for eBay sellers — and it continues to improve its site.
Auctiva offers online auction management software and image hosting for
eBay sellers. The easy-to-use site guides you through the process: creating
auction listings, posting them on eBay, communicating with buyers, collect-
ing payments, organizing shipments, keeping records of sales, marketing your
listings and much more.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Here are some of the site’s features:
 A one-page listing tool: You can create your professional-looking listings
with a complete one-page listing tool — and if you like variety, you can

 Unlimited image hosting: Auctiva enables you to upload hundreds of
images at a time, and you can keep your account organized by managing
your images within Auctiva’s online folder structure.

ChannelAdvisor 
ChannelAdvisor is a very popular, professional-grade management service for
all levels of eBay sellers. The site supplies listing and management services
to everyone from Fortune 1,000 companies to the little old lady next door.
(Her name is Sadie, and she sells antique china.)
ChannelAdvisor offers three levels of software:
 Enterprise is for large companies that want to outsource their online
business.
 Merchant is for mid-size businesses and higher-level PowerSellers.
 Pro is for small businesses and individual sellers.
Most eBay users can comfortably use the Pro version, which costs $29.95 a
month for as long as you use its service. It offers a two-week free trial, but as
a reader of this book you get an additional 30 days of its service free by
typing in the code ebaydummiespro when you register.
Here’s a portion of what you get:
 Listing design and launching: Create your listings with Channel-
Advisor’s standard templates or use your own HTML skills to design
auction descriptions. List your items immediately or schedule a listing.
ChannelAdvisor launches the auction when you tell it to.
 Item and inventory management: If you want to keep your inventory
online, you can create an inventory listing on ChannelAdvisor’s system
or important an Excel template that you created offline. You can also
import open auctions or store listings to your ChannelAdvisor account
for relisting or servicing.
363
Chapter 20: Ten (Or So) Programs and Services to Ease Your Way on eBay

 Image hosting: You get 250MB of space to host your images. You can
upload them to the site four at a time, or use FTP to upload a large
quantity.

information and generates customized e-mail and invoices to your
buyers. You can print mailing labels, too.
To tour the various offerings of ChannelAdvisor and to sign up for its free
trial period, visit www.channeladvisor.com.
InkFrog
InkFrog is another Web-based service that’s been helping eBay sellers since
1999. In 2006 InkFrog bought out another respected service, SpareDollar.
InkFrog represents a super bargain in a Web-based management services.
The best part about its service is that you pay a flat monthly fee of only $9.95.
With its easy-to-use service, little guys can get the same benefits as large-
volume sellers — and pay smaller fees.
You can manage every aspect of your eBay sales, including image hosting, ad
design, automated e-mail management, and report tracking. If you want to get
fancy, you can design your item listing from any its templates. Here are some
more features:
 Image hosting: InkFrog hosts your images and has a very handy
uploader that allows you to insert your images with a click of your
mouse.
 One-step lister: Create your listings (with as many images as you want)
using a simple form. InkFrog also lets you schedule your listings to start
at a future time at no additional cost.
 Checkout system and tracking: InkFrog has a checkout system that inte-
grates with eBay’s checkout system. You can track which items need to
be paid, which items need to be shipped, and which of your customers
need feedback left. You can then update these items in bulk. You can
also automatically send out your custom e-mails to your customers.

Marketworks
Marketworks was one of eBay’s first preferred providers in 1999 and has been
serving thousands of professional sellers since. The company facilitates over
$30 million in monthly sales on eBay in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Australia, and Germany — not to mention eBay Motors. It’s used by
many top PowerSellers who have to manage large inventories and launch lots
of listings. It’s a very professional and automated way to handle auctions.
Here are just a few of its many advanced features:
 Advanced Inventory Management: Marketworks has an easy-to-use
inventory-management system that enables you to post items in your
own area on the site and list them at eBay whenever you want. You can
organize them in individual folders that you create.
 Robust Business Management: Marketworks tracks all functions relat-
ing to the selling process: notifications, payments, shipments, and feed-
back — all of which the system automates to save you time. It also
integrates with PayPal to facilitate auction payments, and with UPS and
the U.S. Postal Service for label printing.
By using its tools, sellers can manage inventory, images, customers, financial
data, and post-auction tasks. Of course, Marketworks also offers profession-
ally designed description templates, image hosting, and a wide variety of
counters. All sellers get a storefront, too — your very own e-commerce site.
Marketworks is a pay-as-you-go service, so be sure that you know what’s new
on the Marketworks Web site (www.marketworks.com), and you can sign up
for a free two-week trial.
BidRobot
As you can tell by reading Chapter 7, I’m a big fan of sniping. It’s my favorite
way to win an auction. It makes the entire auction experience even more
entertaining. Sadly, with the schedule I keep, I am rarely at my computer
when the auctions close!
BidRobot to the rescue. When I find an auction that I’m serious about, I simply
go to the BidRobot Web site, log in, and place my future snipe bids. All I have
to do is type in the item number and my high bid, and that’s it. I can shut off
my computer knowing that BidRobot will do my bidding for me. Nobody
on eBay will know what item I’m desperate to have, because the magical
BidRobot doesn’t place my bid until a few seconds before the auction closes.
If I’m the high bidder, no one will have the chance to bid against me!
365
Chapter 20: Ten (Or So) Programs and Services to Ease Your Way on eBay

BidRobot’s services are reasonably priced, based on the amount of time that
you want to use the service. As of this writing, BidRobot has placed bids for
more than 70,000 eBay users since 1998! You pay a flat rate for all the snipes
you can handle. You don’t pay any extra charges for the service. BidRobot’s
Web site is at www.bidrobot.com.
Software for Offline Use
Software for offline use can handily reside on your computer after a simple
download from a Web site. As with online services, this software comes in a
variety of flavors, so take a look and decide which program works best for
you. Downloadable software may be available from Web sites that offer other
services and can be used whether you are online or not. Offline software
enables you to handle auctions in your spare time, without the limitations of
ISPs or servers.
Auction Wizard 2000
Auction Wizard 2000 is a full-service professional management software pack-
age developed by eBay sellers. The software is fairly simple and amazingly
powerful. It expedites all the seller functions for running and completing
eBay sales, including automating the following tasks:
 Inputting your inventory on the software’s HTML templates and upload-
ing auctions in bulk onto eBay.
 Automatically updating the software with the current status of your auc-
tions, including who won, who is a runner-up, and the auction bidding
history. The preformatted e-mail and feedback files automatically fill in
the values from each auction and send them to the people you do busi-
ness with directly through the software.
 Tracking income and expenses, as well as creating a full set of reports.
If you choose to become a Trading Assistant — that is, sell items for other
people — Auction Wizard 2000 has a separate tracking area where you can
keep track of your consignment sales by consignee. It even computes the fees
that you’re charging for your services.
Download a fully functional 60-day test drive with no inactive features and no
restrictions from www.auctionwizard2000.com.

Shooting Star
A super desktop software from Foodogsoftware, Shooting Star works for sell-
ers on multiple eBay sites: the United States, Canada, Australia, and the
United Kingdom. Download the software to your computer, install it, and
you’re set to perform all listing and management procedures without being
online. Check out the e-commerce software at www.foodogsoftware.com.
eBay’s Software and Services
When the users call, eBay answers! As eBay grew, the need for additional ser-
vices and software also grew. eBay answered the need with Turbo Lister soft-
ware and its PowerSeller program. Read on to see how these services tailored
for the eBay user may benefit you.
eBay’s Turbo Lister
Turbo Lister is free software that enables you to upload many auctions simul-
taneously. After you prepare your auctions offline, the software uploads your
auctions to eBay with just the click of a button. You can edit, preview, and
(whenever you’re ready) launch all your auctions at once, or schedule them
to launch at different times (which costs you $0.10 for each scheduled auc-
tion). Your items can include eBay’s templates, and the items will remain

Finally, for the Mac!
Rejoice! You Mac users out there now have a
couple of eBay listing services that will help you
expedite your listings on eBay. eLister 2 is a full-
powered offline listing program that allows you
the freedom to write up auctions on your own
time and includes a group of good-looking auc-
tion templates. It includes an automatic HTML
generator and an automatic listing fee calcula-
tor. Visit www.blackmagik.com/; the pro-
gram is updated regularly to conform to any
changes in eBay listing procedures.
A very robust solution is Auction Genie, which
not only gives you listing capabilities, but gives
you advanced management software and lots
of extras. It also works with your Mac e-mail
program and provides FTP services for up-
loading your photos to your Web site. Check 
out its services at www.luxcentral.com/
auctiongenie/.

archived on your computer for later use. The software is very convenient and
simple to use even if you have only a few auctions at one time — although
Turbo Lister will let you launch thousands of auctions at a time!
The program is free, and you can download it at pages.ebay.com/turbo_
lister. If your connection is slow and you don’t want to wait for the 18MB
download, you can get a CD from eBay at the eBay Store and just pay ship-
ping costs.
Selling Manager and Selling Manager Pro
I have used Selling Manager for my eBay sales for the past few years, and I
find it to be a very convenient way to quickly relist singly (or in bulk), track
the progress of my sales, send e-mails, leave feedback, and keep track of what
has and hasn’t sold.
You also get a nice selection of reports to help you keep track of how your
listings are performing. This way you can tell whether your sales are on-
target or not.
As you can see from Figure 20-1, Selling Manager (or Selling Manager Pro)
replaces the All Selling page of My eBay. This thorough data is updated auto-
matically from eBay’s servers and PayPal, so you have up-to-the-minute info.

Selling Manager is available from eBay for $4.99 a month. The Pro version,
which adds inventory management and reporting features, is tailored to high-
volume sellers, and it costs $15.99 a month. Both versions are available for a
30-day free trial at www.ebay.com/selling_manager/products.html.
eBay PowerSellers program
eBay offers an elite club for PowerSellers who fulfill the following requirements:
 Maintain a 98-percent positive feedback average with 100 or more feed-
back comments and an excellent sales performance record.
 List a minimum of four average monthly items for the past three months.
 Maintain minimum monthly gross sales of $1,000 of average gross
monthly sales (Bronze level).
No, you don’t need to wear an ugly tie. PowerSellers get a special icon next to
their User IDs on the eBay site, thereby giving potential bidders the assur-
ance that they’re dealing with a seller of good repute who stands behind each
sale. PowerSellers who meet or exceed eBay’s requirements also get the fol-
lowing benefits:
 At the Bronze level and higher, you get a PowerSeller logo posted on the
site next to your User ID, identifying you as an eBay PowerSeller. You
also have access to a private PowerSeller discussion board and have
24/7 e-mail tech support with a very fast response time.
 $3,000 average in monthly gross sales (Silver level) gets you the benefits
of the Bronze level, plus a toll-free phone number for priority support
during business hours.
 $10,000 average in monthly gross sales (Gold level) gets you the benefits
of the Silver level, plus a dedicated account manager and a dedicated
support hot line, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!
 $25,000 average month in gross sales (Platinum) gets you Silver, Bronze,
and Gold level benefits, plus I’ll bet you get quicker callbacks from your
account manager than at the Gold level.
 $150,000 average month in gross sales (Titanium) probably gets you a
whole lot of special attention!
If you feel that you qualify for eBay’s PowerSellers service (eBay knows
who you are!), apply at pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/

Trading Assistant Program
For experienced eBay sellers who have a feedback rating of 97 percent or
more, the Trading Assistant program is the place to be! This is the place
where you can register to sell items for others who don’t have the time or
inclination to learn how to sell on eBay.
All the knowledge you’ve gained from reading this book will help you get
items to sell. People with items to sell go to www.ebay.com/tahub and
search for Trading Assistants by zip or area codes. After their search, they’re
presented with a list of sellers who are ready and willing to sell their goods
(that’s you, right?). Take a look at some of the sellers in your area that act as
Trading Assistants to get an idea of what you should charge for your services.

Appendix A
Answers for the Fanatic: Finding
More Stuff to Sell
A
fter you pick clean everything not nailed down in your house, you may
want to broaden your horizons. The key to successfully selling items at
eBay is to find things people actually want to buy at the right price. (Wow,
what an incredible observation.) I know it seems obvious, but having stuff to
sell isn’t always the same as having things people want to buy. Using this con-
cept, you can teach yourself all kinds of effective marketing strategies.
Finding the item that may be “the next big thing” takes lots of work, timing,
and sometimes a dose of good luck.
As an eBay seller, no doubt you’ll receive tons of spam (unsolicited e-mails)
guaranteeing that the sender has the hottest-selling items for you to sell on
eBay. Think about this for a second. If you had the hot ticket to riches, 
wouldn’t you be selling the product on eBay and making the fortune yourself?
These people aren’t big-hearted millionaires; they make money by preying on
those who think there’s a magic way to make money on eBay. There isn’t. It
takes old-fashioned elbow grease and research.
Knowing the Market
Just as successful stockbrokers know about individual companies, they also
need to know about the marketplace as a whole. Sure, I know about the top
designer purses out there, and so does nearly everyone else. To get a leg up
on your competition, you need to know the big picture as well. Here are some
questions you should ask yourself as you contemplate making serious buck-
ets of money (well, I hope) by selling items at eBay:
 What items are currently hot? If you see everyone around you rushing
to the store to buy a particular item, chances are good that the item will
become more valuable as stocks of it diminish. (iPod accessories?) The
simple rule of supply and demand says that whoever has something
everyone else wants stands to gain major profits. Big-box warehouse

stores like Costco usually have a full stock of popular items because
their very savvy buyers purchase by the truckload months in advance —
how about visiting a warehouse store to find items at discount?
 Do I see a growing interest in a specific item that might make it a big
seller? If you’re starting to hear talk about a particular item, or even an
era (’70s nostalgia? ’60s aluminum Christmas trees? Who knew?), listen
carefully and think of what you already own (or can get your hands on)
that can help you catch a piece of the trend’s action.
 Should I hold on to this item and wait for its value to increase, or
should I sell now? Knowing when to sell an item that you think people
may want is a tricky business. Sometimes, you can catch the trend too
early and find out that you could have commanded a better price if only
you had waited. Other times, you may invest in a fad that’s already
passé and find that no one’s interested anymore. It’s best to test the
market with a small quantity of your hoard, dribbling items individually
into the market until you’ve made back the money you spent to acquire
them. When you have your cash back, the rest will be gravy.
I’m a huge fan of the artist George Rodrigue. When building my collec-
tion of his famous “Blue Dog” items years ago, I came across a seller
who had liberated some early museum exhibition catalogs from a dump-
ster. The old catalogs had been tossed in the trash, but they were boxed
and bundled — and in perfect condition. Being a true-blue Rodrigue fan,
I thought perhaps these catalogs might make good future eBay items. I
asked the seller if he had 30 to sell, he said yes, and sold them to me for
$4 each. I resold them for the next four years, for between $15 and $30
each. Spotting the trends and seeing the value in items is what it’s all
about.
 Is a company discontinuing an item I should stockpile now and sell
later? Pay attention to items that are discontinued, especially toys and
novelty items. If you find an item that a manufacturer has a limited supply
of, you could make a tidy profit. If the manufacturer ends up reissuing
the item, don’t forget that the original run is still the most coveted —
and valuable. I once bought a case of last season’s footless pantyhose at
a huge discount — I sold them one at a time, at a 400 percent profit, for
three years.
 Was there a recall, an error, or a legal proceeding associated with my
item? If so, how it affects the value of the item takes a backseat to eBay
policy: Items that have been recalled can’t be sold on eBay (for details,
go to pages.ebay.com/help/policies/recalled.html). For exam-
ple, a toy recalled for safety reasons may no longer be appropriate for
the kids, but even if it’s rare and collectible, you still can’t sell it on eBay. 
But here’s another angle: Consider that shares of (and any paperwork to
do with) the now defunct corporation, Enron, became highly prized col-
lectibles after the scandal hit.
A2
eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Some people like to go with their gut feelings about when and what to buy for
resale at eBay. By all means, if instinct has worked for you in the past, factor
instinct in here, too. If you’ve done some research that looks optimistic but
your gut says, “I’m not sure,” listen to it; don’t assume you’re just hearing
that lunchtime burger talking. Try testing the waters by purchasing one of the
prospective items for resale at eBay. If that sale doesn’t work out, you won’t
have invested a lot of money, and you can credit your gut with saving you
some bucks.
Do You Have a Talent?
If you’re talented in any way, you can sell your services on eBay. Home arti-
sans, chefs, and even stay-at-home psychics are transacting business daily on
the site. What a great way to make money on eBay — make your own product!
Personalized and custom items do well on eBay. There’s a demand for per-
sonalized invitations, cards, and announcements — and even return address
labels (and you thought you had all you needed). Calligraphic work or 
computer-designed (customized with Fido’s picture, awww) items are in big
demand today, but no one seems to have the time to make them. Savvy sell-
ers with talent can fill this market niche.
People go to trendy places (when they have the time) like Soho, the Grove, or
the Village to find unique custom jewelry. They also go to eBay.
The world is your oyster on eBay, and the sky is the limit. Use your imagina-
tion, and you might be surprised at what your new business will be!
Catching Trends in the Media
Catching trends is all about listening and looking. You can find all kinds of
inside information from newspapers, magazines, television, and of course,
the Internet. Believe it or not, you can even find out what people are inter-
ested in these days by bribing a kid. Keep your eyes and ears open. When
people say, “That GEICO gecko is everywhere,” instead of nodding your head
vacantly, start getting ideas.

Appendix A: Answers for the Fanatic: Finding More Stuff to Sell

In newspapers
Newspapers are bombarded by press releases and inside information from
companies the world over. Pay close attention to the various sections of the
newspaper. Look for stories on celebrities and upcoming movies and see if
any old fads are making a resurgence (you can sell items as “retro chic” —
Lava Lamps, anyone?).
Read the stories about trade conventions, like the New York Toy Fair or the
Consumer Electronics show. New products are introduced and given the
thumbs-up or -down by journalists. This way you can start to think about the
direction your area of expertise is heading.
On television
No matter what you think of television, it has an enormous impact on which
trends come and go and which ones stick. Why else would advertisers sink
billions of dollars into TV commercials? And look at the impact of Oprah’s
Book Club. Just one Oprah appearance for an author can turn a book into an
overnight bestseller. More and more celebrities (even Homer Simpson) are
talking about eBay. The buzz brings people to the site.
Tune in to morning news shows and afternoon talk shows. See what’s being
featured in the programs. The producers of these shows are on top of pop
culture and move fast to be the first to bring you the next big thing. Take
what they feature and think of a marketing angle. If you don’t, you can be
sure somebody else will.
Catch up with youth culture . . .
. . . or at least keep good tabs on it. There’s no catching up with it, just as
there’s no way to say this without sounding over-the-hill: If you remember
cranking up The Beatles, James Brown, or The Partridge Family (say what?)
until your parents screamed, “Shut that awful noise off,” you may be at that
awkward time of life when you hardly see the appeal of what young people
are doing or listening to. But if you want tips for hot-selling items, tolerate the
awful noise of today’s music (how did that happen?) and listen to the kids
around you. (Try to watch a little MTV, too.) Children, especially preteens
and teens, may be the best trend-spotters on the planet. See what kind of
marketing tips you get when you ask a kid questions like these:
A4
eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

 What’s cool at the moment? Or “rad” if you want to sound cool —
whoops, that was ’80s-speak, wasn’t it?
 What’s totally uncool that was cool two months ago? Their world
moves at warp speed!
 What music are you buying? Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, Coldplay, and
Black-Eyed Peas — yup, all the hot bands with big hits — but maybe
ewww-that’s-so-five-minutes-ago by the time you read this.
 What could I buy you that would make you really happy? Hint: If the
kid says, “A red BMW Z-3,” or “Liposuction,” look for a younger kid.
Check out eBay
The staff at eBay sends out reports regarding the up-and-coming items by cat-
egory. Visit eBay’s Seller Central at pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/ for
inside news. To see what has been selling well on eBay in the past 30 days,
click on the What’s Hot link on the left side of the page and you’ll get a wealth
of information.
Click the link to Hot Items by Category and you’ll be presented with a huge
document in Adobe PDF format. The document outlines the hot, hotter, and
hottest items selling in eBay (by category) during the past month. If you
follow this data, you can’t go wrong.
Another important link goes to the eBay Pulse. Visit the Pulse page and you
can find the most-searched-for items in each category by keyword. This is
usually pretty amusing reading — you’d be surprised how many people are
watching eBay listings for get-rich-quick schemes — right along with expen-
sive real estate! You can also reach this page by going directly to pulse.
ebay.com.
There’s a drop-down menu at the top of the page, so that you can see the
most-searched-for items in the main categories.
Check out magazines
Magazines geared to the 18-to-34 age group (and sometimes to younger
teens — they call them tweens) can help you stay on top of what’s hot. See
what the big companies are pitching to this target audience (and whether
they’re succeeding). If a celebrity’s suddenly visible in every other headline
or magazine, be on the lookout for merchandise relating to that person. (Are
we talking hysteria-plus-cash-flow here, or just hysteria?)

The Hunt for eBay Inventory
If you’re not sure what you want to sell for profit at eBay — but you’re a
shop-till-you-drop person by nature — then you’ve got an edge. Incorporate
your advanced shopping techniques into your daily routine. If you find a bar-
gain that interests you, chances are you have a knack for spotting stuff that
other shoppers would love to get their hands on.
The goods are out there
When you shop to sell at eBay, don’t rule out any shopping venue. From the
trendiest boutique to the smallest second-hand store, garage sales to Saks
Outlet, keep your eye out for eBay inventory. The items people look for at
eBay are out there; you just have to find them. 
Check your favorite eBay category and see what the hot-selling items are.
Better yet, go to your favorite store and make friends with the manager. Store
managers are often privy to this type of information a couple of months in
advance of a product release. If you ask, they’ll tell you what’s going to be the
hot new item next month. After you’re armed with the information you need,
seek out that item for the lowest price you can, and then you can give it a
shot on eBay.

Collecting magazines
Though not quite a plethora, the number of mag-
azines geared to collectors is definitely
approaching a slew. Although these magazines
won’t help you catch a trend (by the time it gets
into one of these magazines, somebody’s
already caught it), they can give you great infor-
mation on pricing, availability, and general col-
lecting information. And you can follow the
course of a trend for a real-life example of how
it works. Here’s a list of collectors’ magazines
that I like:
 Antique Trader has been the bible of the
antique collecting industry for over 40 years.
Visit its online home at www.collect.com/
interest/periodical.asp?Pub=AT
for more articles and other information.
 Collect.com is a Web site from Krause pub-
lications. It gives you info on over 35 differ-
ent collector’s publications for everything
from stamps to toys to muscle cars.
 Barbie Bazaar has info on everything
related to Barbie. Go to www.haute
doll.com.
 Numismatic News is an old standard that
has been around for more than 50 years.
The first issue each month includes a pull-
out guide to retail U.S. coin prices. Every
three months, it also includes a U.S. paper-
money price guide. 

Keep these shopping locales in mind when you go on the eBay hunt:
 Upscale department stores, trendy boutiques, outlet stores, or flagship
designer stores are good places to do some market research. Check out
the newest items — and then head to the clearance area or outlet store
and scrutinize the bargain racks for brand-name items.
 Tour some of the discount and dollar stores in your area. Many of the
items these places carry are overruns (too many of something that didn’t
sell), small runs (too little of something that the big guys weren’t inter-
ested in stocking), or out-of-date fad items that need a good home at
eBay.
 Garage sales, tag sales, and moving sales offer some of the biggest bar-
gains you’ll ever come across. Check for vintage kitchen pieces, designer
goods and old toys, and make ’em an offer they can’t refuse.
 Thrift stores are packed with used but usually good-quality items. And
you can feel good knowing that the money you spend in a nonprofit
thrift shop is going to a good cause.
 Find going-out-of-business sales. You can pick up bargains by the case if
a shopkeeper just wants to empty the shelves so the store can close.
 Take advantage of any flea markets or swap meets in your area.
 Gift shops at museums, monuments, national parks, and theme parks
can provide eBay inventory — but think about where to sell the items.
Part of your selling success on eBay is access. People who can’t get to
Graceland may pay handsomely for an Elvis mini-guitar with the official
logo on the box. Or maybe not?
 Hang on to the freebies you get. If you receive handouts (lapel pins, pen-
cils, pamphlets, books, interesting napkins, flashlights, towels, stuffed
toys) from a sporting event, premiere, or historic event — or even a col-
lectible freebie from a fast-food restaurant — any of them could be your
ticket to some eBay sales.
Tips for the modest investor
If you’re interested in making money in your eBay ventures but you’re start-
ing with limited cash, follow this list of eBay inventory Dos and Don’ts:
 Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose. If you shop at boutiques
and expensive department stores, buy things that you like to wear your-
self (or give as gifts) in case they don’t sell.
 Do try to find something local that’s unavailable in a wider area. For
example, if you live in an out-of-the-way place that has a local specialty,
try selling that at eBay.
A7
Appendix A: Answers for the Fanatic: Finding More Stuff to Sell

 Don’t go overboard and buy something really cheap just because it’s
cheap. Figure out who would want the item first.
 Do consider buying in bulk, especially if you know the item sells well at
eBay or if the item is inexpensive. Chances are good that if you buy one
and it sells well at eBay, by the time you try to buy more, the item’s sold
out. If an item is inexpensive (say, 99 cents), I always buy at least five of
it. If no one bids on the item when you hold your auction, you’re only
out $5. (Anyone out there need any Bicentennial Commemorative coffee
mugs?)

Ramping Up Your eBay Business
I
must have heard this a thousand times: “I started selling on eBay just to
get rid of things around the house. I started out slowly and I’ve built up a
nice feedback rating. Now what?” After you’ve actually sold enough merchan-
dise to be successful, you’re thinking that it’s time to sink or swim. You want
this to be a real business. You probably have decided that you want to devote
more time to your eBay business because you’ve begun to pull in some seri-
ous cash — and you think you could make more. It’s time to get serious. You
have the beginnings of a real-live e-business, and a start as a full-time, online
entrepreneur. Really and truly, you do! Yep, you may even become the next
e-commerce tycoon. I don’t want to burst your bubble, but you don’t want to
put the cart before the horse. You’re going to need a handle on a few things
before you can take over the Internet retail world and challenge those
Shooting Star PowerSellers.
So . . . in this last part of the book, I give you a few pointers to steer you in
the right direction to get your eBay business started. I highly recommend
that you grab a copy of one of my other books, Starting an eBay Business For
Dummies (Wiley), which expands on all the ideas discussed in this chapter
and more.
Professional Is as Professional Does
Ignore those silly, get-rich-quick-on-eBay e-mails and e-books. You’re smarter
than that! Yes, there is a huge group of people getting rich on the Internet —
selling get-rich-quick plans to suckers who think there is a magic bullet they
can ride to success. If you think a single class (daylong or otherwise) can
make you an overnight success on eBay, you’re sadly mistaken. Those who
succeed on eBay have one of two things in common:
 They have a background in retailing and have a solid understanding of
merchandising and marketing.
 They went to the school of hard knocks by observing and studying (like
most of us) and have applied what they learned — and succeeded.

In the next few sections, I profile two eBay users who have found success
running eBay businesses. What do these two people have in common? They
worked hard to get where they wanted to be. They didn’t sit back and wait
for magic flakes to fall from the sky and bless them with success. They knew
what they wanted to do and pursued their goals. You can do that, too; no one
is too old, too poor, or too busy. (Remember that you can run an eBay busi-
ness part-time.)
BornToDeal
There’s nothing wrong with the school of hard knocks. Take the example of
my friend Christopher Spencer, eBay user BornToDeal. Chris was definitely
born to deal. When he was six, he was earning almost $50 a week recycling
newspapers. In high school, rather than giving apples to teachers, he sold
teachers home-baked cakes and cookies, making about $300 a month.
Chris’s penchant for computers eventually led him to eBay, in 1999. He began
by talking the owners of a local antiques store into letting him sell a few items
on eBay on their behalf. He was quickly hooked. Christopher now runs close
to 1,000 sales a week for those who want to sell items on eBay. He should be
an inspiration for all Trading Assistants (see Chapter 20 on those who sell for
others) on eBay.
Christopher’s eBay business is big enough that he rents space in a commer-
cial area and has employees working full time to help him. Chris is a top
Trading Assistant — and he’s recently written a book on the subject, The
eBay Entrepreneur: The Definitive Guide for Starting Your Own eBay Trading
Assistant Business. It’s a good read if you plan on getting into that business.
MrsWarren
MrsWarren (Wendy Warren) began selling on eBay in 1999, after deciding to
close her 5,000-square foot brick-and-mortar antiques store and sell online.
Collectibles were her specialty in the beginning — until she bought some new
men’s Hawaiian shirts to sell on the site for the holiday season. The sales
were incredibly successful. Now, her business has changed for the better.
Purchasing more (and more) new items, Wendy developed a new niche of
only-new merchandise for her eBay store: Pretty Girlie Things.
Her store sells everything that the name implies: jewelry, hair accessories,
glitz for the cellphone, handbags, and more. Her creative side took over after
a while and she designed her own line of jewelry and accessories (including
B2
eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

very girly Swarovski crystal-embellished cellphone charms). She’s expanded
her enterprise and now manufactures much of what she sells.
Wendy was also one of the first eBay Ambassadors in 2000 and was one of the
original instructors for eBay University. Wendy’s key to success is that she
follows my golden rule of thinking like a buyer when selecting her merchan-
dise to sell. I’ve always said this is the key to a successful seller and Wendy is
the ultimate example.
Organization Is Key
Organization is the key word for any retail business. Yes, your part- or full-
time eBay business is, in fact, an online retail business. I don’t want you to
think that getting organized is a huge pain, but it will definitely take some
planning. You can compete successfully with the big guys. I do, and all seri-
ous eBay sellers can, too.
Many a Titanium PowerSeller has taken the proverbial downward spiral
because they weren’t organized. Follow these tips and don’t find yourself in
the same predicament.
Setting up your eBay office
Now is the time to move the stuff you hope to sell out of the corner of your
closet (or is it all over the dining room table?) and put it up on shelves. For
starters, use any old shelves, but at least get the merchandise off the furni-
ture and get organized! Here are a few organizational tips:
 Bag and categorize all your items. Use plastic sandwich baggies and
boxes — the white boxes they sell at office supply stores to store old file
folders. These boxes have lots of white space, so you have plenty of
room for labeling the contents of each box. And the cutout holes in the
boxes act as handles for easy toting.
If you want to get fancy (and plan for the future), use the translucent
plastic bins that you can find at stores like Wal-Mart or Target. They
have secure-closing tops and easy-to-lift handles.
 Set aside a separate work area. You’ll need this for packing and wrap-
ping your items. It will also help when you need to assemble your items
to ship.
B3
Appendix B: Ramping Up Your eBay Business

 Designate a place for storing your packing materials. I used to have a
spare bathroom off my office. It’s still somewhat of a bathroom, but now
the shower has shelves loaded with different sizes of boxes and mailing
envelopes.
Automating your shipping
Go back to Chapter 12 and take a look at my recommendations for your ship-
ping setup. When you start your eBay business, it’s time to sign up with a
shipping service. UPS, FedEx, and the United States Postal Service (through
PayPal, Endicia.com, or RedRoller) all provide software that will shave con-
siderable time off your paperwork. And don’t forget the shipping insurance
policy mentioned in Chapter 12 — it costs nothing until you use it.
Spring for a thermal label printer. They can be bought on eBay (of course)
for a fraction of their retail price. Using one will cut an eternity off the pack-
ing time of each item. Think about what kind of gizmos the big guys have —
what streamlines their business? With the advent of the Internet, all the tools
available to the big guys are now available to the small and medium-size
sellers, too.
Getting legal
With success comes responsibility — responsibility to your local community
(translation: You need a business license) and your country (your partner,
Uncle Sam). Depending on where you live, you may have to get a business
license — even if you work out of your house. Often the license fees are lower
for home-based businesses.
When you apply for your business license, be sure to tell the nice folks at the
county office that giant trucks won’t be making deliveries several times a day
to your home. Also, note that even though you will be doing business from
home, you won’t be having customers come to your residence. Your business
transactions will take place online and through the mail. This really makes a
big difference to the county and to your neighbors. If you get to the point
where the trucks are coming several times a day, it might be time to move to
a commercial location.
If you want to buy your merchandise wholesale — that’s part of the idea:
Buy low, sell high — you need to find out if your state requires a resale or
vendor’s license. Most do. Genuine wholesalers will require you to produce this
license as proof of your business status. If they don’t ask for it, they’re proba-
bly not legitimate wholesalers. Buying merchandise through a buying service,
B4
eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition 

warehouse, or other middleman won’t get you the lowest prices. You need to
buy wholesale! This license also allows you to purchase items for sale without
paying sales tax. When you resell the items, you will charge sales tax (assuming
you live in a state with sales tax). You then have to report and pay the tax
you’ve collected to the state within predefined time periods.
Keeping records like a pro
If you’re in a business, whether full-time or part-time, you have to keep some
serious records. Get a good accounting program to keep your records. This
isn’t playtime; it’s time to project a professional image. If you want to do
things right, talk to the person who prepares your taxes or go to a licensed
Enrolled Agent to help you set up the books. My Starting an eBay Business For
Dummies (Wiley) book gives you more information on how you can get
started at home.
Be sure you post your revenue and expenses regularly, and don’t fall behind.
It’s a real pain to have to catch up on six months’ worth of recordkeeping
prior to meeting with your tax professional. (Trust me, I’ve been there.)
Considering a wireless home network
A wireless home network really helps you keep your sanity because you don’t
have to be tethered to your desk all day, everyday. Wouldn’t it be nice to be
able to do some of your eBay business while sitting on the porch or in a ham-
mock in the garden? Believe it or not, it can be done — without going to great
expense.
I was the first on my block to buy a fax machine for my marketing business. I
also had one of the first print-quality PostScript laser printers. But when it
came to networks, I was stymied. I tried to set one up, but somehow, it never
worked correctly.
I wondered about the new wireless Wi-Fi network. Was it as easy to set up as
they said? After all, my portable phone didn’t always work right, so how
could a more complex computer network function correctly? I got the requi-
site hardware from Netgear and went into my office to set it up. I emerged a
half hour later with a fully functioning wireless network! I’m writing this chap-
ter on my laptop in my living room (with wireless built in), which is picking
up a live Internet connection from my office. If I want to print something, it
prints on the printer that’s in another room. When I’m done, I’ll beam this
chapter to my editor in Indianapolis. Now, that’s progress!
