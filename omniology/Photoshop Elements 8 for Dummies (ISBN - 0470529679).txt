Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies 

Introduction
P
hotoshop Elements is now in its 8th version. The product has matured  
as a tool for both professional and amateur photographers who want 
to edit, improve, manage, manipulate, and organize photos and other media. 
Considering the power of the program and impressive features, Elements 
remains one of the best values for your money among computer software 
applications. 
Why should you buy Photoshop Elements (and, ultimately, this book)? The 
range of people who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a 
vast audience. From beginning image editors to intermediate users to more 
advanced amateurs and professionals, Elements has something for every-
one. We’ll even stick our necks out a little and suggest that many Photoshop 
users can benefit greatly by adding Elements to their software tool cabinets. 
Why? Because Elements offers some wonderful creation and sharing tools 
that Photoshop hasn’t yet dreamed of supporting. For example, in Photoshop 
Elements 8, you can create postcards, greeting cards, and photo albums with 
just a few mouse clicks. You can place orders with online service centers that 
professionally print your photo creations. 
To set your frame of mind to thinking in Photoshop Elements terms, don’t 
think of the program as a scaled-down version of Adobe Photoshop; those 
days are gone. Consider the following:
 
✓ If you’re a digital photographer and you shoot your pictures in JPEG 
or Camera Raw format, Elements has the tools for you to open, edit, and 
massage your pictures into professional images. 
 
✓ If you worry about color profile embedding, Elements can handle the 
task for you, as we explain in Chapter 4 where we talk about Camera 
Raw, and in Chapter 14 where we talk about color profiling and printing. 
For the professional, Photoshop Elements has just about everything you 
need to create final images for color printing and commercial printing.
 
✓ If you’re a beginner or an intermediate user, you’ll find some of the 
Photoshop Elements quick-fix operations a breeze to use to help you 
enhance your images, as we explain in Chapters 9 and 10. 
 
✓ If you like to print homemade greeting cards and photo albums — 
whether you’re a beginner, an intermediate user, or a professional user — 
Elements provides you with easy-to-follow steps to package your cre-
ations, as we cover in Chapters 15 and 16. In addition, the wonderful 
sharing services available are your gateway to keeping family, friends, 
and clients connected to your photos, as we explain in Chapter 16.

Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies 
About This Book
This book is an effort to provide, in about 400 pages, as much of a compre-
hensive view of a wildly feature-rich program as we can. Additionally this 
book is written for a cross-platform audience. If you’re a Macintosh user, 
you’ll find all you need to work on Elements 8 for the Macintosh. 
There’s a lot to Elements, and we try to offer you as much as possible within 
our limited amount of space. We begged for more pages, but alas, our pub-
lisher wants to get this book in your hands in full color and with an attractive 
price tag. Therefore, even though we may skip over a few little things, all you 
need to know about using Photoshop Elements for designing images for print, 
sharing, Web hosting, versatile packaging, e-mailing, and more is covered in 
the pages ahead.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone. 
Hence, we know that our audience is large and that not everyone will use 
every tool, command, or method described in this book. Therefore, we added 
a lot of cross-references in the text, in case you want to jump around. You can 
go to just about any chapter and start reading; and, if some concept needs 
more explanation, we point you in the right direction for getting some back-
ground when it’s necessary.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are accessed 
frequently. A couple of things to remember are the references for where to 
go when we detail steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu command, you 
may see a sentence like this one:
Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
When you see commands like this one mentioned, we’re asking you to click 
the File menu to open the drop-down menu, click the menu command labeled 
Get Photos, and then choose the command From Files and Folders from the 
submenu that appears.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps 
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you 
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, right-
click the mouse (Shift-click on the Mac).

3
 Introduction
A third item relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard. When we mention 
that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text is described 
like this:
Press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S (Option+Shift+Ô+S on the Macintosh)
In this case, you hold down the Alt key on Windows or the Option key on the 
Macintosh, the Shift key, and the Control key on Windows or the Ô key on the 
Macintosh and then press the S key. Then, release all the keys at the same time.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into logical parts where related features are nested 
together in chapters within six different parts of the book.
Part I: Getting Started
If you just bought a digital camera and you’re new to image editing in a pro-
gram such as Photoshop Elements, you’re probably tempted to jump into fixing 
and editing your pictures. The essentials usually aren’t the most exciting part 
of any program or book. That’s true with this book, too: The more mundane 
issues related to understanding some basics are assembled in the first three 
chapters. Although some bits of information aren’t as exciting as in many other 
chapters, you must understand them before you start editing images. Be sure 
to review the first three chapters before you dive into the other chapters.
In Part I, we talk about the tools, menus, commands, preferences, work-
spaces, and features that help you move around easily in the program. The 
more you pick up in the preliminary chapters, the more easily you can adapt 
to the Elements way of working.
Part II: Getting Organized
In Part II, we talk about getting photos in Elements, organizing your files, 
searching for files, and grouping your photos, and we give you much more 
information related to the Photoshop Elements Organizer (Windows) or 
Adobe Bridge (Macintosh). The Organizer is your central workplace for 
Windows users or Adobe Bridge on the Macintosh, and knowing a great deal 
about using the Organizer window/Adobe Bridge helps you move around 
much faster in the program.

4
Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies 
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos
Part III relates to creating and manipulating selections. There’s a lot to making 
selections in photos, but after you figure it out (by reading Chapter 7), you 
can cut out a figure in a picture and drop it into another picture, drop different 
backgrounds into pictures, or isolate an area that needs some brightness and 
contrast adjustment. In Chapter 8, we talk about layers and how to create and 
manage them in Elements. In many other chapters, we refer you to Chapter 8 
because you need to work with layers for many other tasks you do in Elements.
In Chapter 9, we talk about fixing image flaws and problems. That picture you 
took with your digital camera may be underexposed or overexposed, or it 
may need some work to remove dust and scratches. Maybe it needs a little 
sharpening, or another imperfection requires editing. All the know-how and 
how-tos are in this chapter.
In Chapter 10, we cover how to correct color problems, brightness, and con-
trast. We show you ways to quickly fix photos, as well as some methods for 
custom image corrections.
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist
This part is designed to bring out the artist in you. Considering the easy appli-
cation of Elements filter effects, you can turn a photo image into a drawing or 
apply a huge number of different effects to change the look of your image.
In Chapter 12, we talk about drawing and painting so that you can let your 
artistic expression run wild. We follow up in Chapter 13 by talking about 
adding text to photos so that you can create your own layouts, posters, 
cards, and more.
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing
One critical chapter in this book is Chapter 14, in which we talk about print-
ing your pictures. If your prints don’t look the way they do on your monitor, 
you need to read and reread this chapter.
If screen viewing is of interest to you, we cover a number of different options 
for viewing your pictures onscreen in Chapter 15. For slide shows, Web-
hosted images, animated images, photo viewing on your TV, and even creat-
ing movie files, this chapter shows you the many ways you can view your 
Elements images onscreen.

5
 Introduction
We wrap up this part with Chapter 16, in which we describe how to make cre-
ations and share files by using various online services. You have a number of 
different options for making creations to share or print.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The last part of the book contains the Part of Tens chapters. We offer ten 
tips for composing better images and give you ten more project ideas to try 
with Elements.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you see icons indicating that something 
important is stated in the respective text.
 
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop 
Elements 8.
 
A Tip tells you about an alternative method for a procedure by giving you a 
shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information related to 
working on tasks in the section being discussed.
 
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This icon indicates 
possible side-effects you might encounter when performing certain opera-
tions in Elements.
 
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory. 
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remembering 
a procedure can save you time.
 
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to 
simplify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical 
information. If we think that a topic is complex, we use this icon to alert 
you that we’re moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of these 
icons in the book because we try our best to give you the details in nontech-
nical terms.

6
Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
As we say earlier in the Introduction, the first part of this book serves as 
a foundation for all the other chapters. Try to spend a little time reading 
through the three chapters in Part I. After that, feel free to jump around and 
pay special attention to the cross-referenced chapters, in case you get stuck 
on a concept.
When you need a little extra help, refer to Chapter 1, where we talk about 
using the online help documents available in Elements.
If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, go to

We hope you have much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 8, and it’s our sincere wish that the pages ahead provide you with 
an informative and helpful view of the program.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
H
ere you have it: a computer book specifi -
cally designed to help you get the most out 
of a computer software program — and not just 
any software program, but a powerful one with 
many complicated features. You probably want to 
jump in and perform some spiffy editing opera-
tions to get that prize photo looking the best you 
can. Inasmuch as we try to accommodate you in 
setting forth a how-to book in a nonlinear fashion, 
where you can freely move around and read about 
the techniques you want to use without having to 
read each chapter in order, you have to under-
stand a few basics for editing your photos.
In this fi rst part of the book, we talk about essen-
tials to help you fully understand all the parts 
ahead. We fi rst talk about your Photoshop 
Elements working environment and describe the 
many tools and features you can use for all your 
Elements sessions. We also cover the very impor-
tant task of getting color set for optimum viewing 
on your computer monitor and explain what you 
need to know about color as it relates to photo 
images. Part I contains some important informa-
tion that you should plan to carefully review and 
understand before going too far into all the 
Elements features. Don’t pass up this part. Turn 
the page and start getting acquainted with the 
Adobe Photoshop Elements basics.

Getting to Know the Work Area
In This Chapter
▶ Opening Photoshop Elements
▶ Understanding the Elements workspace
▶ Changing workspace views
▶ Working with the Project Bin
▶ Using the Undo History panel
▶ Accessing Help documents
▶ Using keyboard shortcuts
W
hen you first launch Photoshop Elements, you arrive at a Welcome 
screen. The Welcome screen offers to open different editing 
modes, help you start special Elements tasks, and sign you up for 
an Adobe Web-hosted service.
When it comes to editing a photograph, you find quite a 
collection of tools, panels, buttons, and options in the 
Photoshop Elements Edit mode. Just a quick glance 
at the Elements workspace when you enter Edit Full 
mode shows you some of the power that Elements 
offers with just a click of your mouse. With all the 
possibilities, navigating the Elements workspaces 
and engaging in an editing session can be intimidat-
ing. To ease your introduction to the many options 
for editing your pictures, we break them down for 
you in this chapter.
Elements has several work areas, and we start off by 
introducing you to the Welcome screen. Then, we move on 
to the mode you’ll likely use frequently — Edit Full mode. In this 
mode, you can be creative with all the tools and features Photoshop 
Elements is known for, such as filters, drawing tools, layers, and more. We 
then introduce other work areas and tools you may not be as familiar with — 
Edit Quick mode for making common corrections to photos; Creation mode 
for collecting your photos into creations, such as calendars; and the Project 
Bin for navigating among all your open images.

10
Part I: Getting Started 
Before you start working in Elements, you may find it helpful to know how 
to undo edits so that you can start over easily and find additional sources of 
help within Elements. We also explain one of the handiest ways to select tools 
and enter common commands: keyboard shortcuts.
Elements also has the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh), a 
powerful tool for acquiring your images and keeping them organized. The 
Organizer/Adobe Bridge includes features that help you view and search 
for images, too. We introduce the Organizer (Windows) and Adobe Bridge 
(Macintosh) in Part II.
Launching Photoshop Elements 8
A great place to start 
in Elements is a central 
navigation area where you 
can choose what mode 
and activity you want to 
engage in. Well, that’s 
exactly what Adobe pro-
vides you when you open 
Photoshop Elements. 
It’s like the command 
center on the Starship 
Enterprise, except you 
won’t find Spock asking 
the computer any ques-
tions. The Welcome 
screen is easy to navigate 
and intuitive, as you 
can see in Figure 1-1 
(Windows) and Figure 1-2 
(Macintosh).
Here’s what you find on 
the Welcome screen:
 
✓ Organize (Windows)/
Browse with Adobe 
Bridge (Macintosh): 
Click the Organize 
button to open the 
Organizer in Windows 
or the Browse with 
Adobe Bridge button on the Macintosh, where you can manage your 
collections of pictures stored on your hard drive. We cover using the 
Organizer/Adobe Bridge and many of its great features in Part II.
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements Welcome screen 
(Windows) appears when you launch Elements.
Figure 1-2: The Photoshop Elements Welcome screen 
(Macintosh).

11
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
 
✓ Edit (Windows): If you need to edit a photo, click the Edit button to 
access options for using either the Quick Fix mode to do some quick 
editing tasks or Edit Full mode, in which you can do the extraordinary 
editing jobs.
 
✓ Start from Scratch (Macintosh): Click this button to open Elements in 
Edit Full mode on the Macintosh.
 
✓ Import from Camera (Macintosh): Click this button to import photos 
from a camera or card reader on the Macintosh. In Windows, you use a 
command in the Organizer to import photos, as we explain in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Import from Scanner (Macintosh): Use this command to scan images 
and open them in Edit Full mode on the Macintosh. In Windows, you use 
a command in the Organizer to scan images as we explain in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Learn More (Windows): Click the Learn More button to get help infor-
mation from Adobe’s Web site.
 
✓ See What You Can Do (Windows): Click the icon below the text to see a 
demonstration of an editing task. You can change task topics by clicking 
the left and right arrows in the lower-right corner of the screen.
If you know what you want to do in Elements, go ahead and click the appro-
priate button. But if you enter one mode and then decide you want to do 
something in another mode, Elements provides you the freedom to easily 
change modes from within the different workspaces.
 
You can always return to the 
Welcome screen after you enter any 
editing mode on Windows. At the 
top of the Elements window in all 
modes, a house icon appears, as 
shown in Figure 1-3. Click this icon 
to open the Welcome screen again. 
On the Macintosh, an icon appears for Launch Bridge instead of an icon for 
the Organizer.
Getting Around in Edit Full Mode
Edit Full mode offers bundles of tools that you can use to edit your images, 
from correction tools for fixing color and clarity to filters, layers, and more 
for changing existing photos or creating entirely original images from scratch. 
But all these tools also make Edit Full mode complex.
Figure 1-4 shows Elements in Edit Full mode, highlighting all the tools and fea-
tures we discuss in the following sections.

bar in any editing mode (Windows) to reopen 
the Welcome screen.

Jumping to Edit Full mode
You can move into Edit Full mode in a couple of ways:
 
✓ From the initial Welcome screen: Click Edit and open a photo. Your 
Elements window appears in Edit Full mode, as shown in Figure 1-4. On 
the Macintosh, click the Start from Scratch icon.
 
✓ From the Organizer/Bridge: Click a photo and choose Edit Photos from 
the Fix drop-down menu. The selected file opens in Edit Full mode. On 
the Macintosh, click a photo on Adobe Bridge; then press the Control 
key and click to open a context menu. From the menu choices, choose 
Open With➪Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.
 
You can also open a context menu on a photo in the Organizer (right-
click your mouse button to make this menu appear) and choose Edit with 
Photoshop Elements from the menu.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Examining the image window
Not surprisingly, the image window’s tools and features are most useful when 
an image is open in the window. To get an image into the image window (as 
shown in Figure 1-4), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open.
 
 The standard Open dialog box appears. It works like any ordinary Open 
dialog box you find in other applications.
 
2. Move around your hard drive by using methods you know to open 
folders and then select a picture.
 
 If you haven’t yet downloaded digital camera images or acquired 
scanned photos and want an image to experiment with, you can use an 
image found in your Pictures folder that was installed with your operat-
ing system.
 
 Elements installs some nice sample images with the application instal-
lation. Look in the Photoshop Elements 8\Tutorials folder to find some 
photos to play with. 
 
3. After selecting a picture, click Open.
 
 The photo opens in a new image window in Elements.
 
You can open as many image windows in Elements as your computer memory 
can handle. When each new file is opened, a thumbnail image is added to the 
Project Bin at the bottom of the screen. (See Figure 1-4.)
 
In Elements 8, you find a new design 
to the user interface. Notice in Figure 
1-4 that filenames appear as tabs 
above the image window. To bring a 
photo forward, click the filename. To 
close a photo, click the X adjacent to 
the filename.
Here’s a quick look at important 
items in the image window, as shown 
in Figure 1-5:
 
✓ Filename: Appears above the 
image window for each file 
open in the Editor.
 
✓ Close button: Click the X to 
the right of the filename to 
close the file.

14
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Scroll bars: Become active when you zoom in on an image. You can click 
the scroll arrows, move the scroll bar, or grab the Hand tool in the Tools 
panel and drag within the window to move the image.
 
✓ Magnification box: Shows you at a glance how much you have zoomed 
in or out.
 
✓ Information box: Shows you a readout for a particular tidbit of informa-
tion. You can choose what information you want to see in this area by 
selecting one of the options from the pop-up menu, which we discuss in 
more detail later in this section.
 
 When you’re working on an image in 
Elements, you always want to know the 
physical image size, the image resolution, 
and the color mode. (These terms are 
explained in more detail in Chapters 3 
and 4.) Regardless of which menu option 
you select from the status bar, you can get 
a quick glimpse at these essential stats 
by clicking the Information box, which 
displays a pop-up menu like the one shown 
in Figure 1-6.
 
✓ Size box: Enables you to resize the window. Move the cursor to the 
box, and a diagonal line with two opposing arrows appears. When the 
cursor changes, drag in or out to size the window smaller or larger, 
respectively.
 
 You can also resize the window by dragging any corner in or out.
After you’re familiar with the overall image 
window, we want to introduce you to the 
Information box’s pop-up menu, which enables 
you to choose the type of information you want 
to view in the Information box. Click the right-
pointing arrow to open the menu, as shown in 
Figure 1-7.
Here’s the lowdown of the options you find on the 
pop-up menu:
 
✓ Document Sizes: Shows you the saved 
file size.
 
✓ Document Profile: Shows you the color pro-
file used with the file. Understanding color 
profiles is important when printing files. Look to Chapters 2 and 14 for 
more information on using color profiles.
 
✓ Document Dimensions: Which is selected in Figure 1-7, shows you the 
physical size in your default unit of measure, such as inches.
Figure 1-6: Click the readout on 
the status bar, and a pop-up 
menu shows you important 
information about your file.
Figure 1-7: From the pop-up 
menu on the status bar, select 
commands that provide infor-
mation about your file.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
 
✓ Scratch Sizes: Displays the amount of memory on your hard drive that’s 
consumed by all documents open in Elements. For example, 20M/200M 
indicates that the open documents consume 20 megabytes and that a 
total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements to edit your images. 
When you add more content to a file, such as new layers, the first figure 
grows while the second figure remains static. 
 
✓ Efficiency: Indicates how many operations you’re performing in RAM, 
as opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%, you’re 
working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you’re using the 
scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good indication 
that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency. 
 
✓ Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
 
✓ Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools panel.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing 
to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at will 
during your editing sessions.
Moving through the menu bar
Like just about every program you launch, Elements supports drop-down 
menus. The menus are logically constructed and identified to provide com-
mands for working with your pictures (including many commands that you 
don’t find supported in tools and on panels). A quick glimpse at the menu 
names gives you a hint of what might be contained in a given menu list.
Here are the ten different menus (eleven on a Mac):
 
✓ Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 (Mac only): On the Macintosh, you find 
the Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 menu preceding the File menu. This 
menu provides you the Quit command used to exit Elements, and it pro-
vides access to Edit Full Preferences, as we explain in Chapter 2.
 
✓ File: Just as you might suspect, the File menu contains commands for work-
ing with your picture as a file. You find commands on the menu for saving, 
opening, processing, importing, exporting, and printing. We cover saving 
files in Chapter 3 and printing or exporting for other output in Part V. 
 
✓ Edit: The old-fashioned Copy, Cut, and Paste commands are located on 
this menu. Additionally, you have some important application settings 
commands on the menu, including preferences (Windows), which we 
cover in more detail in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Image: You use the Image menu most often when you want to effect 
changes to the entire image, such as changing a color mode or crop-
ping, rotating, and resizing the image. For details about sizing and color 
modes, check out Chapter 3. For more about cropping and rotating 
images, flip to Chapter 9.

16
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Enhance: Just the name of this menu should tell you what commands 
to expect here. This is where you go to change the appearance of an 
image, such as changing its brightness and contrast, adjusting its color 
and lighting, and doing some other smart fix-up work to improve its 
appearance. On the Enhance➪Adjust Color submenu, you find a number 
of commands that offer you a variety of color adjustments. Look to 
Chapter 10 for some detail on correcting color. In Chapters 9 and 10, 
you can find out how to use correction tools so that your images look 
their best.
 
✓ Layer: As we describe in great detail in Chapter 8 (a whole chapter just 
about layers), most kinds of editing you do in Elements are best handled 
by using layers. Elements neatly tucks away most of the relevant com-
mands associated with working in layers right in this menu.
 
✓ Select: Of just about equal importance to layers are selections. Whereas 
the Image menu contains commands that are applied to the entire 
image, you can edit isolated areas of an image by using the commands 
on the Select menu. To isolate an area, you need to create a selection, as 
we explain in Chapter 7. This menu contains commands to help you with 
many essential tasks related to working with selections.
 
✓ Filter: The Filter menu is where you find some professional photo-
graphic darkroom techniques, or you can completely leave the world of 
photography and explore the world of a fine artist. With tons of different 
filter commands, you can create some extraordinary effects. Find out all 
about filters in Chapter 11.
 
✓ View: Zooming in and out of images, turning on a grid, exposing horizon-
tal and vertical rulers, adding annotations, and checking out the print 
sizes of your pictures are handled on the View menu. Chapter 5 unearths 
secrets of the Zoom tool, rulers, and more.
 
✓ Window: Elements supports a number of different panels, as we explain 
in the section “Playing with panels,” later in this chapter. Elements 
has so many panels that keeping them all open at one time is impracti-
cal. Thanks to the Window menu, you can easily view and hide panels, 
reopen the Welcome window, tile and cascade open windows, and bring 
inactive windows to the foreground.
 
✓ Help: We hope that you get all the help you need right here in this book; 
but just in case we miss something (or your neighbor has borrowed it, 
fine book that it is), you have some interactive help right at your mouse-
tip on the Help menu. The menu also offers links to the Adobe Web site 
for more information and a little assistance, courtesy of the tutorials 
accessible from this menu. (Find a little more detail about accessing 
help in the section “Getting a Helping Hand,” later in this chapter.)

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Uncovering the context menus
Context menus are common to many programs, and Photoshop Elements is 
no exception. They’re those little menus that appear when you right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Mac), offering commands and tools related to 
whatever area or tool you right-clicked. On Macintosh computers with two 
mouse buttons, you can right-click to open a context menu.
 
The context menus are your solution when you may be in doubt about where 
to find a command on a menu. You just right-click an item, and a shortcut 
menu opens. Before you become familiar with Photoshop Elements and strug-
gle to find a menu command, always try to first open a context menu and 
look for the command you want on that menu.
Because context menus provide commands 
respective to the tool you’re using or the object 
or location you’re clicking, the menu commands 
change according to what tool or feature you’re 
using and where you click at the moment you 
open a context menu. For example, in Figure 1-8, 
you can see the context menu that appears after 
we create a selection marquee and right-click that 
marquee in the image window. Notice that the 
commands are all related to selections.
 
Notice, in Figure 1-8, the Transform Selection 
command. Elements 8 enables you to modify 
selections using this command, as we explain in 
Chapter 7.
Using the Tools panel
Elements provides a good number of panels for 
different purposes. The one that you’ll find you 
use most is the Tools panel. In panel hierarchy 
terms, you typically first click a tool on the Tools panel, and then use another 
panel for additional tool options or use the Options bar (which we describe 
in the section “Selecting tool options in the Options bar,” later in the chapter) 
for fine-tuning your tool instruments. More often than not, clicking a tool on 
the Tools panel is your first step in most editing operations.
Figure 1-8: A context menu for 
selections.

18
Part I: Getting Started 
 
By default, the Tools panel opens as a single row of 
tools down the left side of the Elements window. You 
can change the view to a double row of tools by 
clicking the right-pointing double chevron. Doing so 
shows all tools when you’re working on smaller 
computer monitors.
You can easily access tools in Elements by pressing 
shortcut keys on your keyboard. For a quick glance 
at the Tools panel and the keystrokes needed to 
access the tools, look over Figure 1-9.
Notice on the Tools panel that several tools appear 
with a tiny arrowhead pointing right and downward 
in the lower-right corner of the tool. Whenever you 
see this arrowhead, remember that more tools are 
nested within that tool group. Click a tool with an 
arrowhead and hold down the mouse button, or for 
a faster response from Elements, just right-click a 
tool. A pop-up toolbar opens, as shown in Figure 
1-10, that offers you more tool selections within 
that group.
To select tools within a tool group by using key-
strokes, hold down the Shift key and strike the 
respective key (as shown in Figure 1-9) to access 
the tool. Keep the Shift key down and repeatedly 
press the shortcut key to step through all tools in 
a given group.
 
Whether you have to press the Shift key to 
select tools is controlled by a preference 
setting. To change the default setting so 
that you don’t have to press Shift, choose 
Edit➪Preferences➪General (Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 8➪Preferences➪General) or press 
Ctrl+K (Ô+K on the Mac).
 
The shortcuts work for you at all times except when 
you’re typing text with the cursor active inside a 
text block. Be certain to click the Tools panel to 
select a tool when you finish editing some text.
The tools are varied, and you may find that you 
don’t use all the tools in the Tools panel in your 
workflow. Rather than describe the tool functions 
here, we address the tools in the rest of this book 
as they pertain to the respective Elements tasks.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Selecting tool options from the Options bar
When you click a tool on the Tools 
panel, the Options bar offers you 
choices specific to the selected tool. 
Figure 1-11 shows the options avail-
able when the Brush tool is selected.
Playing with panels
Elements provides you with a bunch 
of panels that contain settings and 
options used to refine the tools you select on the Tools panel and tasks you 
perform to edit images. Assume for a moment that you want to let your cre-
ative juices loose and create a Picasso-esque painting — something that you 
can do easily in Photoshop Elements.
Figure 1-11: The Options bar provides attribute choices for a tool selected on the Tools panel.
First, click the Brush tool and then click a color on the Color Swatches panel. 
On a new canvas, you begin to paint. When you want to change color, click 
again on the Color Swatches panel on a different color. This kind of interactiv-
ity between the Tools panel and another panel is something you frequently 
use in Elements.
Panels are accessed from either the Panels Bin or the Window menu. Many 
options on panels are intuitive. To become familiar with various panel options, 
just poke around a little, and most of the options will become familiar to you.
 
You can drag panels away from the 
Panel Bin and scatter them all over 
the Elements workspace. If you 
remove panels and want to return to 
all panels docked in the Panel Bin, 
click Reset Panels at the top of the 
Editor window.
By default, you find the panel buttons 
for Edit Full (while in Edit Full mode), 
Create, and Share with the panels 
expanded, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-10: Click and hold the mouse button 
on a tool that has a tiny arrowhead to open a 
pop-up toolbar.
Figure 1-12: The default view shows panels 
expanded.

20
Part I: Getting Started 
You can use these panels as we explain in the text that follows:
 
✓ Edit Full: Gain quick access to editing tasks. From a drop-down menu, 
you can toggle editing modes. While you’re in Edit Full mode, you see 
the button appearing as Edit Full. Open the drop-down menu and you 
find Edit Quick and Edit Guided. You can change editing modes by 
choosing one of the menu commands. If you change to Edit Quick, the 
tab name likewise changes to Edit Quick.
 
✓ Create: Click this button to access options to create photo books, photo 
collages, and slide shows and order prints and greeting cards. Click 
More Options on the Create panel to access additional creation options.
 
✓ Share: Click this button to access options that offer many different 
ways to share your photos with others. On the Share panel, you find 
options for creating an online album, sending photos via e-mail attach-
ments, using photo and writing CDs and DVDs of photo collections and 
slide shows. Clicking More Options on the Share panel offers additional 
options for sharing photos.
 
Click the right-pointing double chev-
ron below the Share button, and the 
panels collapse to a view, as shown 
in Figure 1-13. You open a panel by 
clicking a button. However, when 
you need more working area for your 
photos, you can collapse the panels.
 
When the panels are collapsed, click 
the left-pointing chevrons to open 
the panels.
Juggling all your interface options
With all the settings you can use for any given tool, trying to figure out 
exactly where to select an option for the edit you want to make can become 
downright frustrating. To help simplify the process of using tools and select-
ing options for the tools, here’s what you might do in your normal workflow:
 
1. Select a tool on the Tools panel.
 
 Obviously, you need to know what task you want to perform, so select-
ing the proper tool to complete the task is important to know upfront.
 
2. Take a quick look at the Options bar.
 
 Before moving to other option choices, be certain that you look over the 
choices on the Options bar. If you want to use a tool such as the Brush 
tool or the Clone Stamp tool, perhaps you want to make a decision 
Figure 1-13: Click the right-pointing chevrons 
and the panels collapse, providing you more 
space to work in the image window.

21
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
about what size brush tip you want to use. This choice is specific to the 
selected tool and therefore appears as an Options bar choice.
 
3. Open a panel for more options.
 
 If you want to use the Brush tool to apply some color to an image, for 
example, after you select the Brush tip on the Options bar, open the 
Color Swatches panel and select a color.
 
4. Open a drop-down menu.
 
 Not all tools support a drop-down menu on the Options bar. When you 
see a down-pointing arrow, click the arrow to open a menu on which you 
can find more options for some tools.
 
5. Get some help.
 
 When you hover your cursor over a tool, you see that tool described 
in blue text. Click the blue text, and your default Web browser opens, 
displaying a page on Adobe’s Web site where help information and tips 
explain how to use the respective tool. You’ll also find blue text on the 
More menu. The blue text alerts you to help information that can be 
shown in your Web browser.
Changing Workspaces
When you’re in Edit Full mode, which we discuss in preceding sections, you 
can apply any kind of edits to a picture, improve the picture’s appearance, 
and apply all that Elements offers you. This mode is the richest editor in 
Elements, in terms of accessing all features. Because Elements has so many 
different kinds of editing opportunities, the program offers you other work-
space views, tailored to the kinds of tasks people typically want to perform.
Using Edit Quick mode
Edit Quick mode is designed to provide you with just those tools that you 
need to prepare a picture for its intended destination, whether it’s printing, 
onscreen viewing, or one of the other organizing items. Use this mode to 
make your pictures look good. You don’t find tools for adding text, painting 
with brushes, or applying gradients in Edit Quick mode. Rather, what you find 
is a completely different set of panels for balancing contrast and brightness, 
lighting, and sharpening, for example. This mode is like having a digital dark-
room on your desktop, where you take care of perfecting an image like you 
would in analog photography darkrooms.
To enter Edit Quick mode while you’re in Edit Full mode, click the Edit 
Full button to open the drop-down menu and choose Edit Quick; the view 
changes, as shown in Figure 1-14.

22
Part I: Getting Started 
Figure 1-14: Click Edit Quick from the drop-down menu.
Here are several differences between Edit Full mode and Edit Quick mode:
 
✓ Completely different sets of panels are docked in the Panels Bin. All 
the panels in Edit Quick mode are related to adjusting brightness con-
trols, and they’re designed to improve the overall appearance of your 
pictures. In addition, all the Windows menu commands for accessing 
panels are grayed out. While you work in Edit Quick mode, Elements 
insists on limiting your use of panels to just the ones docked in the 
Panels Bin. Moreover, you can’t undock panels from the Panels Bin by 
dragging them out, as you can in other modes.
 
✓ The Tools panel shrinks. Edit Quick mode offers only these tools on the 
Tools panel:
 
• Zoom
 
• Hand
 
• Magic Selection Brush
 
• Crop
 
• Red Eye Removal
 
• Whiten Teeth

23
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
 
• Make Dull Skies Blue
 
• Black and White — High Contrast
 
 None of the other Elements tools is accessible while you work in this mode.
 
✓ Multiple viewing options are available. Notice in Figure 1-14 that you 
see two views of the same image. The Before view on the left displays 
the unedited image. The After view shows you the results of changes 
you make with panel options and menu commands. You select different 
viewing modes from menu choices on the View drop-down menu below 
the image window.
If you want to return to Edit Full mode, open the drop-down menu where you 
see Edit Quick, and choose Edit Full.
Using creation tools
To organize your pictures for display in a variety 
of different ways, begin by clicking the Create 
button. The panels in the Panels Bin change to 
support different creation options. Click one of 
the listed options for making a new creation or 
click the More Options button to select from 
additional options. In Figure 1-15, we clicked the 
Create button and then clicked the Photo Collage 
button to start a new creation for a photo col-
lage. As you can see in Figure 1-15, the Panels Bin 
changed to reflect options available to us for 
creating our photo collage.
We cover each option available in the various 
creation panels in greater detail in Chapter 16.
Using the Project Bin
The Project Bin displays thumbnail views of all 
your open images. Regardless of whether you 
work in Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, you can 
immediately see a small image of all the pictures 
you have open at one time, as shown in Figure 
1-16. You can also see thumbnail views of all the 
different views you create for a single picture. 
Find out all the details in the following sections.
If you want to rearrange the thumbnails in the 
Project Bin, click and drag horizontally to reorga-
nize the order of the thumbnails.
Figure 1-15: Click Create 
and then choose an option for 
the type of creation you want 
to edit.

24
Part I: Getting Started 
Figure 1-16: All open pictures and new views are displayed as thumbnails in the Project Bin.
Creating different views of an image
What? Different views of the same picture, you say? Yes, indeed. You might 
create a new view when you want to zoom in on an area for some precise 
editing and then want to switch back to a wider view. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Double-click a thumbnail image in the Project Bin.
 
 That photo appears in the image window as the active document.
 
2. Choose View➪New Window for <filename>.
 
 Note that <filename> is the name of the file in the image window.
 
3. Zoom to the new view.
 
 A new view appears for the active document, and you see another 
thumbnail image added to the Project Bin.
 
 To zoom quickly, click the Zoom tool and click a few times on the picture 
in the image window to zoom in to the photo.
 
4. Toggle views of the same image.
 
 Double-click the original thumbnail to see the opening view; double-click 
the other thumbnail to see the zoomed view.
Hiding the Project Bin
The Project Bin takes up a lot of room at the bottom of the image window, 
and you’re not likely to want it open all the time while editing pictures. To 
temporarily hide the Project Bin, do one of the following:
 
✓ Place the cursor over the separator bar between the image window and 
the Project Bin. When the cursor changes to two horizontal lines with 
vertical opposing arrowheads, drag down to collapse the Project Bin. 
When the Bin is collapsed, drag up the separator bar to open it.
 
✓ Double-click the separator bar to hide the Project Bin.
 
✓ Click the Hide Project Bin text at the bottom of the Project Bin.
 
✓ Open a context menu by right-clicking and select Close at the top of 
the menu.

25
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Using Bin Actions
A nice feature in Elements is the Bin Actions menu at the top of the Project 
Bin. Click Bin Actions to start a new creation, share photos, print all the files 
open in the Bin, and save the Bin files as an album.
To the left of the Bin Actions menu, you’ll find another feature for viewing 
files in Elements. The Show Open Files (shown by default on Windows only) 
is another drop-down menu that offers two options: the default option to show 
open files and another choice to show files from the Organizer. Choose Show 
Files from Organizer to add the files in your Organizer to the Project Bin.
Retracing Your Steps
Ever since Apple’s Macintosh brought a window-like interface to the masses, 
the Undo command has been one of the most frequently used menu com-
mands in every program developed. You make a change to your document, 
and if you don’t like it, you simply choose Edit➪Undo or press the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Macintosh).
In Elements, your options to undo your work provide you much more than 
reverting to the last view, as we explain in the following sections.
Using the Undo History panel
Elements takes the Undo command to new 
levels by offering you a panel on which all (well, 
almost all) your changes in an editing session are 
recorded and available for undoing at any step in 
an editing sequence.
Each edit you make is recorded on the Undo 
History panel. To open the panel, choose 
Window➪Undo History. Make changes to your 
document, and each step is recorded on the 
panel, as you see in Figure 1-17.
 
If Elements slows down and you’re moving along 
at a snail’s pace, choose Edit➪Clear➪Undo 
History or choose Clear Undo History from 
the panel’s options menu. Elements flushes 
all the recorded history and frees up some pre-
cious memory that often enables you to work 
faster. You can also use Edit➪Clear Clipboard 
or Edit➪Clear➪All to eliminate clipboard data 
from memory.
Figure 1-17: The Undo History 
panel.

26
Part I: Getting Started 
We said almost all steps are recorded because the number of steps the 
History panel can record is controlled by a preference setting that tops out at 
1,000 steps. If you choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 8➪Preferences (Mac) and look at the Performance preferences, as 
we explain in more depth in Chapter 2, the number of history states (times 
you can go back in history and undo) defaults to 50. You can change the 
number to the maximum 1,000, if you like. But realize that the more history 
states you record, the more memory Elements requires.
When you want to undo multiple edits, open the Undo History panel and click 
any item listed on the panel. Elements takes you to that last edit while scrub-
bing all edits that follow the selected item. If you want to bring back the edits, 
just click again on any step appearing grayed out on the panel to redo up to 
that level.
All your steps are listed on the Undo History panel as long as you remain in 
Elements and don’t close the file. When the file is closed, all history informa-
tion is lost.
Reverting to the last save
While you work away in Elements, always plan on saving your work regularly. 
Each time you save in an editing session, the Undo History panel preserves 
the list of edits you made before the save and up to the maximum number of 
history states defined in the General preferences.
If you save, then perform more edits, and then want to return to the last 
saved version of your document, Elements provides you with a quick, effi-
cient way to do so. If you choose Edit➪Revert, Elements eliminates your new 
edits and takes you back to the last time you saved your file.
When you choose Revert, Revert appears in the Undo History panel. You can 
eliminate the Revert command from the Undo History panel by right-clicking 
Revert on the Undo History panel and choosing Delete from the context menu 
that appears. This command returns you to the edits made after the last save.
Getting a Helping Hand
You can reach for this book whenever you want some details about accom-
plishing a task while working in Elements. However, for those little annoy-
ing moments, and just in case some coffee stains blot out a few pages in 
this book, you may want to look for an alternative feature description from 
another source.

27
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Rather than accumulate a library of Elements books, all you need to do is 
look within Elements to find valuable help information quickly and easily. If 
you’re stuck on understanding a feature, ample help documents are only a 
mouse click away and can help you overcome some frustrating moments.
Using Help
Your first stop in exploring the helpful information Elements provides is on 
the Help menu. On this menu, you can find several menu commands that 
offer information:
 
✓ Photoshop Elements Help: Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or 
press the F1 key (Windows) to open the Elements Help file. You can type 
a search topic and press Enter to open a list of items that provide help-
ful information about the searched words.
 
 For quick access to the Help document, type the text you want to search 
into the text box on the right side of the menu bar in Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode.
 
✓ Key Concepts: While you read this book, if we use a term that you don’t 
completely understand, open the Photoshop Elements Key Concepts. A 
Web page opens in your default Web browser and provides many Web 
pages with definitions of terms and concepts.
 
✓ Support: This menu command launches your default Web browser and 
takes you to the Adobe Web site, where you can find information about 
Elements, problems reported by users, and some work-around meth-
ods for getting a job done. Additional Web-assisted help information is 
available by clicking Photoshop Elements Online and Online Learning 
Resources. The vast collection of Web pages on Adobe’s Web site offers 
you assistance, tips and techniques, and solutions to many problems 
that come with editing images. Be sure to spend some time browsing 
these Web pages.
 
✓ Video Tutorials: Choose Help➪Video Tutorials to open a Web page 
where videos for common tasks are hosted on Adobe’s Web site.
 
✓ Forum: Choose Help➪Forum to explore user comments and questions 
with answers to many common problems.
Using ToolTips
While you move your cursor around tools and panels, pause a moment 
before clicking the mouse. A slight delay in your actions produces a ToolTip. 
Elements provides this sort of dynamic help when you pause the cursor 
before moving to another location.

▶ Specifying editing preferences
▶ Specifying organizing preferences
▶ Working with presets
▶ Understanding color in Photoshop Elements
▶ Setting up your color management system
A
lthough not as exciting as firing up Elements and working on your pre-
cious pictures, customizing Elements for your personal work habits 
and properly setting up color management is critical to everything else you 
do in the program. This chapter explains how to take charge of Elements and 
customize your work environment by adjusting preference settings 
and setting up a color management system. If you’re new to 
Elements or image editing in general, you might not know 
just how you want to set up certain features right away. 
However, you can always refer to this chapter when 
you review and update settings and options later, after 
you become familiar with other features in Elements.
Controlling the Editing 
Environment
Opening Elements for the first time is like moving into 
a new office. Before you begin work, you need to orga-
nize the office. At minimum, you need to set up the desk 
and computer before you can do anything. In Elements terms, 
the office organization consists of specifying Preferences settings. 
Preferences are settings that provide a means to customize your work in 
Elements and to fine-tune the program according to your personal work habits.
What we offer in the following sections is a brief description of the preference 
options available to you. When you need some detail regarding one preference 
option or another, look at the help documents we discuss in Chapter 1. If you 

30
Part I: Getting Started 
use the help documents as a reference, you won’t need to memorize the vast 
number of settings Elements provides.
 
There are two Preferences dialog boxes. One Preferences dialog box is 
available in the Edit Full mode workspace, and the other is available in the 
Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh) workspace. This section 
covers the Preferences dialog box that you open when in Edit Full mode; it’s 
common to both Windows and the Macintosh.
Launching and navigating Preferences
Preferences, which you can access in Edit Full mode, are all contained in 
a dialog box that’s organized into nine panes. By default, when you open 
the Preferences dialog box, the opening pane is the General pane. To open 
the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General. (Or choose 
Adobe Photoshop Elements 8➪Preferences➪General on a Macintosh). 
Alternatively, press Ctrl+K (Ô+K on a Macintosh). Using either method opens 
the Preferences dialog box to the General pane, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: The General pane in the Preferences dialog box.
In Figure 2-1, you see items on both the left and right sides of the dialog box 
that are common to all preference panes. Here’s a quick introduction to what 
these items are and how they work:
 
✓ Panes list: Elements lists all the different panes in the Preferences dialog 
box along the left side of the dialog box. Click an item in the list to make 
the respective pane open on the right side of the dialog box. (In ear-
lier versions of Elements, you had a drop-down menu from which you 
selected the different panes.)
 
✓ OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane and dismiss the 
Preferences dialog box.

31
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
 
✓ Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the same settings as when you opened 
a pane and to dismiss the dialog box. If you hold down the Alt key, the 
Cancel button changes to Reset, and clicking that button performs the 
same action as clicking the Reset button.
 
✓ Reset: If you change the settings options and click Reset, the action 
takes you back to the same settings as when you opened the Preferences 
dialog box, and the dialog box remains open.
 
✓ Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
 
✓ Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press Ctrl+(1 through 9 keys) 
to jump to another pane. Or press Ô+(1 through 9 keys) on a Macintosh. 
Checking out all the preferences panes
The settings in the Preferences dialog box are organized into different panes 
that reflect key categories of preferences. The following list briefly describes 
the types of settings you can adjust in each of the preferences panes:
 
✓ General preferences, as the name implies, apply to overall general set-
tings you adjust for your editing environment.
 
✓ Saving Files preferences relate to options available for saving files. You 
can choose to add extensions to filenames, save files with layers or flat-
ten layers when you’re saving a file (as we explain in Chapter 8), save 
files with image previews that appear when you’re viewing files as icons 
on your desktop, and save with some compatibility options.
 
✓ Performance preferences is the pane where you find history states 
(explained in Chapter 1) and memory settings, such as scratch disk set-
tings. (See the sidebar “What’s a scratch disk?” in this chapter for more 
on scratch disks.)
What’s a scratch disk?
Assume that you have 100 megabytes (MB) of 
free RAM (your internal computer memory) and 
you want to work on a picture that consumes 
200MB of hard disk space. Elements needs to 
load all 200MB of the file into RAM. Therefore, 
an auxiliary source of RAM is needed in order for 
you to work on the image; Elements uses your 
hard drive. When a hard drive is used as an 
extension of RAM, this source is a scratch disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connected 
to your computer, you can instruct Elements to 
use all hard drives, and you can select the order 
of the hard drives that Elements uses for your 
extension of RAM. All disks and media sources 
appear in a list as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

32
Part I: Getting Started 
 
 Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives that have connec-
tions slower than USB 2 or FireWire. Using slower drives slows Elements’ 
performance.
 
✓ Display & Cursors preferences offer options for how certain tool cur-
sors are displayed and how you view the Crop tool when you’re crop-
ping images.
 
✓ Transparency preferences require an understanding of how Elements 
represents transparency. Imagine painting a portrait on a piece of clear 
acetate. The area you paint is opaque, and the area surrounding the por-
trait is transparent. To display transparency in Elements, you need some 
method to represent transparent areas. (Chapter 7 has more details.) 
Open the Transparency preferences and make choices for how transpar-
ency is displayed in your 2-D Elements environment.
 
✓ Units & Rulers preferences let you specify settings for ruler units, 
column guides, and document preset resolutions.
 
✓ Grid preferences (Windows) or Guides & Grid (Macintosh) offer options 
for gridline color, divisions, and subdivisions. A grid shows you nonprint-
ing horizontal and vertical lines. You use a grid to align objects, type, 
and other elements. You can snap items to the gridlines to make aligning 
objects much easier.
 
✓ Plug-Ins preferences include options for selecting an additional Plug-Ins 
folder for storing third-party utilities to work with Elements.
 
✓ Type preferences provide options for setting text attributes. You have 
options for using different quote marks, showing Asian characters, 
showing font names in English, and previewing font sizes.
Controlling the Organizing 
Environment (Windows)
 
A whole different set of Preferences appears when you open the Organizer 
and choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl+K. Initially, you may be confused 
because the dialog box that opens when you work in the Organizer is also 
named Preferences. However, a quick glance at the dialog box shows you a 
different set of Preferences choices. In the following sections, you can find a 
brief introduction to the Organizer and discover all the different organization 
preferences that Elements has to offer.
 
When you open the Edit Full or Edit Quick mode and press Ctrl+K to open the 
Preferences dialog box, pressing Ctrl+K+0 (zero) opens the Organizer

Understanding the Photoshop Elements Organizer
We cover all you need to know about the wonderful Adobe Photoshop Elements 
Organizer environment in Chapter 6, so we don’t describe in this chapter 
all that the Organizer offers you. Just be aware that when you’re setting the 
Organizer preferences, you’re setting preference options for the Organizer only. 
To take a quick peek at the Organizer, click the Organizer button at the top of 
the Elements window while in Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
Navigating Organizer preferences
You can open the Organizer Preferences dialog box after opening the Organizer. 
You can use a keyboard shortcut to open the Organizer Preferences dialog 
box. Press Ctrl+0 (zero) to open the Organizer from within a Preferences 
dialog box in either editor to gain access to the Organizer Preferences dialog 
box. Alternatively, you can choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl+K in the 
Organizer window to open the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: Choose Edit➪Preferences and select a submenu item to 
open the Organizer Preferences dialog box.
The Organizer Preferences dialog box uses the same metaphor to toggle 
through a number of panes that the Edit Preferences dialog box uses. Click

Part I: Getting Started 
the names in the list on the left side of the dialog box to open the respective 
panes on the right. At the bottom of the dialog box, you find items that are 
common to all panes in the Preferences dialog box. These include
 
✓ Restore Default Settings: Click Restore Default Settings to change all 
panes to their original defaults.
 
✓ OK: Click OK to accept new changes.
 
✓ Cancel: Click Cancel in any pane and any changes you made aren’t 
registered.
 
✓ Help: Click Help to open the Help window and find information about 
Organize & Share preferences.
Setting preferences in all the panes
With the Organizer Preferences dialog box open, here’s a quick overview of 
what you find there:
 
✓ General preferences: These items affect a miscellaneous group of set-
tings that are applied to files when you’re using the Create tool. Chapter 
16 explains this tool in detail. You also find settings for changing the 
Interface Brightness from Dark to Light. These settings were found in the 
editor preferences in Elements 7 and have been moved to the Organizer 
preferences in Elements 8.
 
✓ Files preferences: Offers options for managing file data, connecting to 
missing files, setting prompts to back up your data, saving catalogs, 
choosing file and folder locations for saved files, rotating images, burn-
ing CD/DVDs, and handling preview sizes.
 
✓ Folder Location View preferences: Provides options for showing files 
and folders in groups and selected folders.
 
✓ Editing preferences: You can enable another application that provides 
some editing features not found in Elements to edit an image based 
on its file type. One good example for adding another editor is when 
you’re editing video clips. If you have Adobe Premiere Elements, you 
can add Premiere Elements as another editor. If you don’t have Premiere 
Elements installed, you can use another editor, such as Windows Movie 
Maker.
 
✓ Camera or Card Reader preferences: Handle acquiring images from 
digital cameras and media storage cards. Your computer may have 
a built-in card reader in which you can insert a media card, such as 

35
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
CompactFlash or Smart Media, or a USB card reader that supports a 
media card. In other cases, you may have a cable that connects from 
your camera to a USB port on your computer. Use these preference 
options with media cards, camera connections, and download options.
 
✓ Scanner preferences: If you scan images with a scanner connected to 
your computer, the Scanner preferences hold all the options you may 
want to set.
 
✓ Date View preferences: View files that you can add to the pane or from 
selections for a variety of holiday dates.
 
✓ Keyword Tags and Albums preferences: Helps you find and sort your 
images, as we explain in much more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. Tag pref-
erences offer options for sorting tags and icon views for tags.
 
✓ Sharing preferences: Relate to sharing files via e-mail. Options are 
available for setting an e-mail client and adding captions to e-mailed 
files.
 
✓ Adobe Partner Services preferences: Offer choices for handling pro-
gram updates and online service orders. You can choose to check for 
program updates automatically or manually, choose options for print-
ing and sharing images, and specify how you want to update creations, 
accounts, and more.
 
✓ Auto Analyzer options: The Auto Analyzer is a new feature in Elements 
8 that performs automatic analysis of media in a catalog —things like 
analyzing photos with people in the images. You can turn off the Auto 
Analyzer in this pane. 
Organizing Photos on the Macintosh
Photoshop Elements operates much differently on the Macintosh than on a 
Windows computer when it comes to organizing your photos. On the Mac, 
you don’t have the Organizer and you don’t have image catalogs. Photo orga-
nization on the Macintosh occurs within the Adobe Bridge window.
Adobe Bridge ships with several Creative Suite programs and is frequently 
used by Adobe Photoshop users on both the Macintosh and Windows.
You have preference options for Adobe Bridge just like you have preference 
choices for the Organizer. Press Ô+K, and the Adobe Bridge Preferences 
dialog shown in Figure 2-3 opens.

36
Part I: Getting Started 
We won’t walk you 
through all the options 
you have for work-
ing with Adobe Bridge 
Preferences. The dialog 
has similar attributes as 
you find in the Organizer, 
where a list appears 
on the left side of the 
dialog and the right pane 
changes when you click 
an item in the list.
Many of the Adobe Bridge 
Preferences are intuitive 
and easy to follow. If you 
have difficulty in under-
standing a preference 
choice, consult the online 
help information, which 
you can easily access by choosing Adobe Bridge Help from the Help menu.
Customizing Presets
Part of the fun of image editing is choosing brush tips, swatch colors, gra-
dient colors, and patterns to create the look you want. To get you started, 
Elements provides you with a number of preset libraries that you can load 
and use at your will. For example, you can load a Brushes library to acquire 
different brush tips you use with the Brush tool. But you’re likely to want to 
customize the preset libraries at least a little bit, too.
You can change libraries individually 
in respective panels where the items 
are used. For example, you can change 
color swatch libraries on the Color 
Swatches panel or brush tips libraries 
from Options bar choices. Another way 
you can change libraries is to use the 
Preset Manager, as shown in Figure 2-4.
We cover using the presets in 
Chapter 12, which is where you can 
find out how to use the many differ-
ent presets that Elements provides. 
The important thing to note here 
is that you can change the presets 
according to your editing needs.

To open the Preset Manager dialog box, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. The 
options you have available include
 
✓ Learn More About: The Preset Manager: Click the blue Preset Manager 
hyperlinked text to open the Help document and find out more about 
managing presets.
 
✓ Preset Type: Open the drop-down menu to choose from Brushes, 
Swatches, Gradients, and Patterns.
 
✓ More: The More drop-down menu lists different viewing options. You 
can view the library items as text lists or as thumbnail views.
 
✓ Done: Any changes you make in the Preset Manager are recorded and 
saved when you click Done.
 
✓ Load: Click this button to open another library. Elements provides you 
with several libraries for each preset type from which to choose.
 
✓ Save Set: You can save any changes you make in the Preset Manager as 
a new library. If you make a change, use this option so that you don’t 
disturb the original presets.
 
✓ Rename: Each item in a library has a unique name. If you want to 
rename an item, click the thumbnail in the Preview pane, click Rename, 
and type a new name in the dialog box that appears.
 
✓ Delete: Click an item in the Preview window and click Delete to remove 
the item from the library.
Getting Familiar with Color
We could spend a whole lot of time and many pages in this book delving into 
the complex world of color theory and definitions. You wouldn’t likely read 
it, and we’re not so inclined to reduce this book from a real page-turner to 
something that’s likely to sedate you. Rather, in the following sections, we 
offer some fundamental principles to make your work in Elements easier 
when you’re editing color images.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of understanding color is to understand what RGB is and how 
it comes about. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These are the primary 
colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about primary 
colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ-
ual channels in Elements, you still need to understand just a little about color 
channels.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
When you see a color pixel (a tiny square), the color is represented as dif-
ferent levels of gray in each channel. This may sound confusing at first, but 
stay with us for just a minute. When you have a color channel, such as the 
red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up with 
a bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less light 
pass through, thereby diluting the red color. This is how channels work. 
Individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256 levels of 
light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of light in the dif-
ferent channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. The total 
number of possibilities for creating color in an RGB model is achieved by 
multiplying the values for each channel (256 × 256 × 256). The result is more 
than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer monitor can 
display in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as 
theory goes, but what does that mean 
in practicality? Actually, you see some 
of this information in Elements tools 
and dialog boxes. As an experiment, 
open a file in Elements and choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels; the 
dialog box shown in Figure 2-5 opens.
Notice that the Channel drop-down 
menu shows you Red, Green, and 
Blue as individual channels, as 
well as a composite RGB selection. 
Furthermore, the Output Levels 
area shows you values ranging from 
0 on the left to 255 on the right. 
Considering that 0 is a number, you 
have a total of 256 different levels 
of gray.
 
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to RGB 
images that comprise three different channels. There are 256 levels of gray 
that can let through or hold back light and change brightness values and 
color. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more on using tools, such as levels, to adjust 
color in this way.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit holds 
one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you have 
256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image — 8 bits 
with two possible values each is 28, or 256, possible levels of gray. Multiply 
Figure 2-5: Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog box.

39
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
8 bits per channel times 3 channels (the red, green, and blue channels), and 
you get 24 bits, which is the common bit depth of images you print on your 
desktop printer.
Now, take a look at the Image➪Mode 
menu. You should see a menu selec-
tion that says 8 Bits/Channel. When 
you open an image in Elements, if 
this menu command is grayed out as 
shown in Figure 2-6, you’re working 
with a 24-bit image, or an image of 
8 bits per channel.
What does it mean when you can 
select the 8 Bits/Channel menu 
command? You can be certain that 
your image isn’t an 8-bit-per-channel 
image. You may be able to select this 
command because some digital cam-
eras and most low-end, consumer-
grade scanners can capture images 
at higher bit depths. You can scan a photo on a scanner at 16 bits per chan-
nel. When you do, you end up with many more levels of gray. When you take 
a picture with a quality digital camera, you can capture 16-bit-per-channel 
images, and you end up with a file containing more than 4,000 levels of gray. 
That’s a lot!
Now, here’s the catch. All files need to be reduced to 8 bits per channel 
before you print them because that’s all the information any printer uses. In 
addition, many tools, commands, and panel options work only with 8-bit-per-
channel images. So, you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at higher 
bit depths than I can print them?”
 
If you attempt to adjust brightness and contrast, or other image enhance-
ments, in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can 
cause some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders too 
far while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit and 
32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform Elements which 256 
of the total available levels of gray you want to use. The result is an image with 
more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-per-channel images. 
The following section explains how you change an image’s bit depth.
To clarify the advantages of working with 16-bit images, take a look at the 
effects of adjusting photos in 8-bit versus 16-bit modes. In Chapters 9 and 10 
we talk about using the Enhance menu commands and, more specifically, 
using the Levels dialog box to adjust image brightness. Before you jump to 
those chapters, take a look at the results you get when adjusting a photo 
using Levels on an 8-bit image and the same adjustment on a 16-bit image.
Figure 2-6: When you can choose 8 Bits/
Channel, your image bit depth is higher than 
8 bits per channel.

40
Part I: Getting Started 
Take a look at Figure 2-7. This image is flat and needs a contrast boost. The 
first edit you need to make in Elements is a Levels adjustment. When you 
choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels or just press Ctrl+L (Ô+L on the 
Mac), the Levels dialog box opens.
Figure 2-7: An image that needs a contrast adjustment.
Notice in the Levels dialog box 
that the histogram shows no data 
on the far left side of the histogram 
in Figure 2-8.
An image with a good tonal range 
has data across the histogram and 
appears like a bell shaped graph. 
To make a Levels adjustment, you 
simply move the slider below the 
histogram to the right (in this image) 
until it appears at the beginning of 
the data in the graph, as you see in 
Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-8: No data appear on the far left side 
of the histogram.

41
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
If you make a similar adjustment, 
click OK, then reopen the Levels 
dialog box, you see the histogram 
appearing similar to what is shown 
in Figure 2-10. Notice that the histo-
gram now has gaps along the graph. 
These gaps indicate that no data are 
contained in the areas where you see 
the white lines. In essence, you have 
experienced data loss.
To contrast this adjustment on an 
8-bit image with the same adjust-
ment applied to a 16-bit image, look 
at Figure 2-11. After making the same 
Levels adjustment and reopening the 
Levels dialog box you find a much 
different result. Notice the histogram 
displays a solid tonal range with no 
gaps in the graph.
 
The bottom line in regard to making 
contrast adjustments in Elements is 
that you are always best served by 
making your edits for brightness and 
contrast as well as for color correc-
tion on 16-bit images compared to 
8-bit images.
Converting 8-bit images 
to 16-bit images
If you don’t have a digital camera 
capable of capturing 16-bit images, 
are you limited to only working in 
8-bit mode? Quite simply, the answer 
is no. You can convert any image 
taken in 8-bit mode with a digital 
camera or a scanner to a full 16-bit image. 
Follow these steps to make the conversion from 8-bit to 16-bit mode:
 
1. Open Elements in Edit Full mode. On the Macintosh, you need to work 
in Adobe Bridge. Use the File➪Open in Camera Raw command in 
Bridge.
 
2. Choose File➪Open As. In the Open As dialog box choose Camera Raw 
from the Open As drop-down menu.
Figure 2-9: Move the left slider to the right to 
the point where you see the first data in the 
histogram.
Figure 2-10: After making a Levels adjustment 
and reopening the Levels dialog box you see 
the histogram appearing with data loss.

3. Click Open Copy in the Camera 
Raw converter.
 
 Do not make any adjustments 
in the Camera Raw converter, 
shown in Figure 2-12. As yet, the 
photo is not a true 16-bit image.
 
4. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size to open the Image Size 
dialog box.
 
5. Check the boxes for Constrain 
Proportions and Resample 
Image. Choose Percent from 
the Width drop-down menu 
and type 71 in the text box. 
 
 Both the Width and Height 
are sized when the Constrain 
Proportions check boxes are checked as shown in Figure 2-13.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 You now have a true 16-bit image.
Figure 2-12: The Camera Raw converter.
Figure 2-11: When adjusting contrast on 16-bit 
images you retain a smooth tonal transition.

43
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
The reason we resampled the image 
to 71 percent is that we needed to 
downsample the image 50 percent. 
By setting the value to 71 you get 
precisely one half the number of 
pixels in the resultant image. Don’t 
worry about the math, just believe 
us that the end result will be a 
true 16-bt image. You can compare 
adjusting Levels on an image before 
and after following these steps and 
examine the histograms to see the 
results.
Getting Color Right
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color 
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your 
computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. Output can be a 
printout from a color printer or a screen view on a Web page.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can’t expect to achieve 
an exact match. You have far too many printer and monitor variables to 
deal with. However, if you properly manage color, you can get a very close 
match.
To match color between your monitor and your output, you need to first 
calibrate your monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the 
following sections, you can find all the details.
Calibrating your monitor
Your monitor needs to be calibrated to adjust the gamma and brightness, cor-
rect any color tints or colorcasts, and generally get your monitor to display, 
as precisely as possible, accurate colors on your output. You can choose 
among a few tools to adjust monitor brightness. These tools range from a 
low-cost hardware device that sells for less than $100 to expensive calibra-
tion equipment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the hardware and use 
tools provided by Mac OS X or Windows.
 
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms, 
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or 
more stages in an imaging pipeline.
Figure 2-13: Resample the image to 71 percent.

44
Part I: Getting Started 
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you 
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable purchase 
for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low end, 
some affordable devices go a long way in helping you adjust your monitor 
brightness and color balance, with prices ranging from around $60 to $100 
U.S. The best way to find a device that works for you is to search the Internet 
to find hardware descriptions, dealers, and costs. You’ll find items such as 
the ColorVision Spyder2express and Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction, 
to name just a few.
On LCD monitors, you need to adjust the hardware controls to bring your 
monitor into a match for overall brightness with your photo prints. Be cer-
tain to run many test prints and match your prints against your monitor view 
to make the two as similar as possible.
You have a lot to focus on to calibrate monitors and get color right on your 
monitor and your output. We talk more about color output in Chapter 14. For 
a good resource for color correction and printing using Photoshop Elements, 
we recommend that you look at Color Management for Digital Photographers 
For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
Choosing a color workspace
After you adjust your monitor color by using a hardware profiling system, 
your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you have a 
choice between two workspace colors: either sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). 
You access your color workspace settings by choosing Edit➪Color Settings. 
The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-14.
Figure 2-14: The Color Settings dialog box.

45
 Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box include
 
✓ No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management. 
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements. When using 
No Color Management, you need to work with files that have color pro-
files embedded in the photos. Most likely you won’t use these types of 
photos. For information related to when you might use the No Color 
Management option, see Chapter 14.
 
✓ Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Selecting this radio 
button sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for 
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the 
best choice for color printing, too. Many color printers can output all 
the colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo 
services, such as the Kodak EasyShare services we talk about in Chapter 
16, prefer this workspace color.
 
✓ Always Optimize for Printing: Selecting this option sets your color 
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). The color in this workspace has more 
available colors than you can see on your monitor. If you choose this 
workspace, be certain that your printer is capable of using all the colors 
in this color space.
 
✓ Allow Me to Choose: When you choose this option, Elements prompts 
you for a profile assignment when you open images that contain no pro-
file. This setting is handy if you work back and forth between screen and 
print images.
Understanding how profiles work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your moni-
tor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color 
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your 
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni-
tor brightness and corrects for any colorcasts. When you open a photo in 
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space to 
your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your 
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color to 
your printer’s color space. In Chapter 14, we show you how to use color pro-
files for printing. For now, just realize that each of these color profiles, and 
using them properly, determines whether you can get good color output.

Working with Resolutions, Color 
Modes, and File Formats
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding and changing resolution
▶ Resampling images
▶ Understanding color modes
▶ Working with file formats
W
hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at a 
huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and the 
number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This 
relationship between pixels and resolution, which is important 
for you to understand in all your Elements work, relates to 
creating selections (as we explain in Chapter 7), printing 
files (Chapter 14), and sharing files (Chapter 16).
Color modes are also represented as collections of 
pixels. Color modes are important when you’re 
using tools, and printing and sharing files.
This chapter explains some essential points about 
resolution, color modes, and the file formats you 
use to save your Elements images. We talk about 
changing resolution by resizing images, converting 
color modes, and saving the results in different file 
formats.
The Ubiquitous Pixels
Files you open in Elements are composed of millions of tiny, square pixels. 
Each pixel has one, and only one, color value. The arrangement of the pixels 
of different shades and colors creates an illusion to your eyes when you’re 

48
Part I: Getting Started 
viewing an image onscreen. For example, you may have black and white 
pixels arranged in an order that creates the impression that you’re looking at 
something gray — not at tiny black and white squares.
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels. You 
surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects in 
your image; you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and bright-
ness; you change shades and tints of pixels for color correction; and you per-
form a host of other editing possibilities.
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and 
Elements files: Your pictures are raster images. When you have pixels, you 
have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that isn’t made of pixels, 
Elements rasterizes the data. In other words, Elements converts other data to 
pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
 
You can also have vector content in an Elements file. Text added with the 
Type Tool, for example, is a vector object. When you save an Elements file 
with the Text layer intact or save as a Photoshop PDF file, the vector data is 
maintained. We talk more about vector data in Chapter 13. For this chapter, 
you just need to focus on raster data.
 
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working 
on a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and commands 
are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines its image resolution. If you have 72 
pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi). 
If you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
 
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files in these instances:
 
✓ When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints 
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing all 
the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
 
✓ When you show images onscreen: Just like images have resolution inher-
ent in their files, your computer monitor displays everything you see on 
it in a fixed resolution. Computer monitors display images at 72 ppi (or 85 
or 96 ppi or higher depending on the monitor aspect ratio). That’s all you 
get. What’s important to know is that you can always best view photos on 
your computer monitor at a 72-ppi image size in a 100-percent view.

49
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
 
 As an example, take a look at Figure 3-1. You see an 
image reduced to 50 percent and then at different 
zoom sizes. When the size changes, the resolution 
display on your monitor changes. When the size 
is 100 percent, you see the image exactly as it will 
print. The 100-percent size represents the image 
displayed on your monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of 
the resolution of the file.
This relationship between the image resolution and view-
ing the image at different zoom levels is an important con-
cept to grasp. If you grab an image off the Web and zoom 
in on it, you may see a view like the 800-percent view 
shown in Figure 3-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, 
you may need to zoom out to a 16-percent view to fit the 
entire image in the Image window.
The reason that these displays vary so much is all image 
resolution. That Web page image you grabbed off the 
Web might be a 2-inch-square image at 72 ppi, and that 
digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image at 
240 ppi. To fill the entire window with the Web image, 
you need to zoom in on the file. When you zoom in, the 
resolution is lowered. The more you zoom, the lower the 
resolution on your monitor.
 
When you zoom into or out of an image, you change 
the resolution as it appears on your monitor. No resolu-
tion changes are made to the file. The image resolution 
remains the same until you use one of the Elements 
tools to reduce or increase image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. 
If the size is 4 x 5 inches, for example, the file can be any 
number of different resolution values. After the file is 
open in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an 
image, the resolution, or both.
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not 
the number of pixels it contains), an inverse relation-
ship exists between the physical size of your image and 
the resolution. When image size is increased, resolution 
decreases. Conversely, when you raise resolution, you 
lower image size.

Part I: Getting Started 
The Art of Resampling
In some cases, images are too large, and you need to reduce their resolu-
tion and physical size. In other cases, you might need a higher resolution 
to output your images at larger sizes. This method of sizing — changing the 
size, as well as the number of pixels — is resampling an image.
 
Specifically, reducing resolution is downsampling, and raising resolution is 
upsampling.
 
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you toss away 
pixels or manufacture new pixels. We discuss the sampling details in the sec-
tion “Understanding the results of resampling,” later in this chapter.
Changing image size and resolution
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple different ways. One 
method is cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or without resam-
pling images. For more information on using the Crop tool, see Chapter 9. 
Another method is using the Image Size dialog box, which you use in many of 
your editing sessions in Elements.
To resize an image with the Image Size dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I 
(Ô+Alt+I on the Mac). The 
Image Size dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
 The Pixel Dimensions area 
in the Image Size dialog box 
shows the file size (such as 
23.4M). This number is the 
amount of space the image 
takes up on your hard drive. 
The width and height values 
are fixed unless you click the 
Resample Image check box at 
the bottom of the dialog box.
 
2. In the Document Size area, you 
can redefine dimensions and 
resolution. The options are
Figure 3-2: Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size to open the Image Size dialog box.

51
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
 
• Width: Type a value in the text box to resize the image’s width and 
then press Tab to move out of the field to implement the change. 
From the drop-down menu to the right of the text box, you can 
choose a unit of measure: percent, inches, centimeters, millime-
ters, points, picas, or columns.
 
• Height: The Height options are the same as the Width options with 
the exception of no column setting. If you keep the sizing propor-
tional, you typically edit either the Width or Height text box, but 
not both. When you alter either width or height, the resolution 
changes inversely.
 
• Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution, and press 
the Tab key to change the value. When resolution is edited, the 
Width and Height values are changed inversely (if the Constrain 
Proportions check box is selected).
 
3. If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size, 
select the Resample Image check box.
 
 With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at 
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of 
pixels. When the box is deselected, the values for dimensions are linked. 
Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
 
 Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the fol-
lowing section.
 
4. If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a resam-
pling method, as well as other resample options.
 
 In the drop-down list, you find resampling-method choices. See Table 3-1 
for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image check box 
become active when you select the Resample Image box. Here’s what 
they do:
 
• Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles panel from which you can 
add a variety of different style effects to images. (See Chapter 11 
for details.) When you apply a style, such as a frame border, the 
border appears at a defined width. When you select the Scale 
Styles box and then resize the image, the Styles effect is also 
resized. Leaving the check box deselected keeps the style at the 
same size while the image is resized.
 
• Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected, and 
you want to keep it that way unless you want to intentionally 
distort an image.
 
5. When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your 
image.

Resampling Methods
Method
What It Does
Best Uses
Nearest Neighbor
This method is fastest, 
and the results produce a 
smaller file size.
This method is best used 
when you have large areas 
of the same color.
Bilinear
This method produces a 
medium-quality image.
You might use this option 
with grayscale images and 
line art.
Bicubic
This method is the default 
and provides a good-
quality image.
Unless you find better 
results by using any of the 
other methods, leave the 
default at Bicubic.
Bicubic Smoother
This method improves on 
the Bicubic method, but 
you notice a little softening 
of the edges.
If sharpness isn’t critical 
and you find Bicubic not 
quite doing the job, try this 
method. This method tends 
to work best if you have to 
upsample an image.
Bicubic Sharper
This method produces good-
quality images and sharpens 
the results.
Downsample high-resolution 
images that need to be 
output to screen resolutions 
and Web pages.
Understanding the results of resampling
 
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution 
isn’t. If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the origi-
nal source (such as rescanning the image or reshooting a picture), try (if 
you can) to create a new file that has the resolution you want, instead of 
resampling in Elements. In some cases, upsampled images can be severely 
degraded.
If you take a picture with a digital camera and want to add the picture to a 
Web page, the image needs to be sampled at 72 ppi. In most cases, you visit 
the Image Size dialog box, select the Resample Image check box, add a width 
or height value, and type 72 in the Resolution text box. What you end up with 

53
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
is an image that looks great on your 
Web page. In Figure 3-3, you can see 
an image that was downsampled in 
Elements from over 14 inches hori-
zontal width.
 
If you start with an image that 
was originally sampled for a Web 
page and you want to print a large 
poster, you can forget about using 
Elements or any other image editor. 
Upsampling low-resolution images 
often turns them to mush, as you can 
see in Figure 3-4.
You might wonder whether upsam-
pling can be used for any purpose. In 
some cases, yes, you can upsample 
with some satisfactory results. 
You can experience better results 
with higher resolutions of 300 ppi 
and more if the resample size isn’t 
extraordinary. If all else fails, try 
applying a filter to a grainy, upsam-
pled image to mask the problem. 
Chapter 11 has the details on filters.
Choosing a Resolution for 
Print or Onscreen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount to print-
ing files. Good ol’ 72-ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many of 
your large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slide shows. With 
output to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many different print-
ing output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ-
ent resolutions and on different papers. You can quickly determine the best 
file attributes by running tests. When you send files to service centers, ask 
the technicians what file attributes work best with their equipment.
Figure 3-4: Upsampling low-resolution images 
often produces severely degraded results.

produces satisfactory results.

Go Ahead — Make My Mode!
Regardless of what output you prepare your files for, you need to consider 
color mode and file format. In Chapter 2, we talk about RGB (red, green, and 
blue) color mode. This color mode is what you use to prepare color files for 
printing on your desktop color printer or for preparing files for photo service 
centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB. If you start with an RGB color 
image and want to convert to a different color mode, you have menu options 
for converting color. Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm (a mathemati-
cal formula) to convert pixels from one mode to another. In some cases, the 
conversion that’s made via a menu command produces good results, and in 
other cases, you can use some different options for converting modes.
In the following sections, we introduce the modes that are available in 
Elements and explain how to convert from RGB to the mode of your choice: 
bitmap, grayscale, or indexed color.
 
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t 
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of what it is and the 
purposes of CMYK images. CMYK, commonly referred to as process color, 
contains percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors. This mode 
is used for commercial printing. If you design a magazine cover in Elements 
and send the file to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted to CMYK. 
Also note that most desktop printers use different ink sets within the CMYK 
color space.

55
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Converting to Bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects that you create from your 
RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap image and 
import it into other programs, such as the Microsoft Office programs. If you’re 
creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color to produce many 
interesting effects.
 
The Elements Bitmap mode isn’t the same as the Windows .bmp file format. 
In Elements, Bitmap mode is a color mode. A .bmp file can be an RGB color 
mode image, a Grayscale color mode image, or a Bitmap color mode image.
 
One important thing to keep in mind is that when you combine images into 
single documents, as we explain in Chapter 8, you need to convert bitmap 
files to grayscale or color if you want to merge the images with an RGB image. 
If you convert to grayscale, Elements takes care of converting grayscale to 
RGB mode.
As an example of an effect resulting 
from combining grayscale and color 
images, look over Figure 3-5. The 
original RGB image was converted to 
a bitmap and then saved as a differ-
ent file. The bitmap was converted to 
grayscale and dropped on top of the 
RGB image. After adjusting the opac-
ity, the result is a grainy effect with 
desaturated color.
You can acquire Bitmap mode images 
directly in Elements when you scan 
images that are black and white. 
Illustrated art, logos, your signature, 
or a copy of a fax might be the kind 
of files you scan directly in Bitmap 
mode. Additionally, you can convert 
your images to Bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a 
two-step process. You need to first 
convert to grayscale and then con-
vert from grayscale to bitmap. If you 
select the Bitmap menu command 
while in RGB color, Elements prompts 
you to convert to grayscale first.
Figure 3-5: You can create some interesting 
effects by combining the same image from a 
bitmap file and an RGB file.

56
Part I: Getting Started 
To convert RGB mode to Bitmap mode, do the following:
 
1. Open an image that you want to convert to Bitmap mode in either Edit 
Full or Edit Quick mode.
 
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
 
 If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to grayscale.
 
3. Click OK, and the Bitmap dialog box opens.
 
 The Bitmap dialog box provides options for selecting the output resolu-
tion and a conversion method.
 
4. Select a resolution.
 
 By default, the Bitmap dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 3-6, 
displays the current resolution. 
You can edit the text box and 
type a new resolution value or 
accept the default.
 
5. From the Use drop-down menu, 
select from these settings:
 
• 50% Threshold
 
• Pattern Dither
 
• Diffusion Dither
 
 Look over Figure 3-7 to see a 
comparison of the different 
methods used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.
 
6. Click OK to convert your image to Bitmap mode.
Converting to Grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of 
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a 
black-and-white photo.
 
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but remember 
that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. We recommend that you 
avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. When 
Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the pixels, so 
you lose some precious data during the conversion and can’t regain the color 
after conversion. If you were to convert an image to grayscale, save the file, 
and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color image 
would be lost forever. You could save a secondary file, but this method can 
add a little confusion and require some more space on your hard drive.

and select the conversion method from the 
Use drop-down menu.

and Diffusion Dither.
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to gray-
scale, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an RGB image in Elements.
 
2. Duplicate a layer.
 
 The default Panels Bin contains the Layers panel. In this panel, you find 
a pop-up menu when you click More in the upper-right corner. From the 
menu commands, choose Duplicate Layer. .(For more information on 
working with layers, see Chapter 8.)
 
 You can also duplicate a layer by dragging the layer name to the New 
Layer icon at the bottom of the Layer panel.
 
3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation to open the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box, shown in Figure 3-8.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+U (Ô+U on the Macintosh).

58
Part I: Getting Started 
 
4. Drag the Saturation slider to 
the far left to desaturate the 
image and click OK.
 
 All color disappears, but the 
brightness values of all the 
pixels remain unaffected. (For 
more information on using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box and 
the other Adjust Color com-
mands, see Chapter 10.)
 
5. Turn off the color layer by 
clicking the eye icon in the 
Layers panel.
 
 In the Layers panel, you see two 
layers, as shown in Figure 3-9. 
You don’t need to turn off the 
color layer to print the file in 
grayscale, but turning it off can help you remember which color layer 
you used the last time you printed or exported the file.
Following the preceding steps pro-
vides you with a file that contains 
both RGB and grayscale. If you want 
to print the color layer, you can turn 
off the grayscale layer. If you need to 
exchange files with graphic design-
ers, you can send the layered file, 
and then the design professional can 
use both the color image and the 
grayscale image.
The other advantage of converting 
RGB color to grayscale by using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box is that 
you don’t disturb any changes in 
the brightness values of the pixels. 
Moving the Saturation slider to 
desaturate the image affects only the 
color. The luminance and lightness values remain the same.
A menu command was introduced in Photoshop Elements 5 for converting 
color images to grayscale. Choose Enhance➪Convert to Black and White in 
either Edit Full mode or Edit Quick mode, and you see the Convert to Black 
and White dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-8: Open the Hue/Saturation dialog box 
and move the Saturation slider to the far left to 
eliminate color.
Figure 3-9: The Layers panel shows the gray-
scale and color layers. You can turn layers on 
or off by clicking the eye icon.

59
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-10: The Convert to Black and White dialog box.
This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and contrast 
in images that you convert to grayscale. You can select from some preset 
options in the Select a Style list. You move the sliders in the Adjustment 
Intensity area and view a dynamic preview in the After thumbnail area.
 
If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same file as the gray-
scale version, duplicate the background by choosing Duplicate Layer 
from the Layers panel’s More menu. Click the background and choose 
Enhance➪Convert to Black and White. The conversion is applied only to the 
background, leaving the Background copy layer in your original color mode.
Converting to Indexed Color mode
Indexed Color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics, such as saving 
in GIF format or PNG-8. When saving indexed color images, you can, at times, 
create smaller file sizes than RGB that are ideal for using in Web site designs.
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) are capable of rendering 
colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors, as we explain in Chapter 2. An 
indexed color image is an 8-bit image with only a single channel. The total 
number of colors you get with indexed color can be no more than 256. When 
you convert RGB images to indexed color, you can choose to dither the color, 

60
Part I: Getting Started 
which displays the image with a dithered effect much like you see with bit-
mapped images. This dithering effect makes the file appear as though it has 
more than 256 colors, and the transition between colors appears smoother 
than if no dithering was applied.
On occasion, indexed color images have an advantage over RGB images when 
hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, the smaller the 
file size. When you prepare images for Web hosting, you can choose to use 
indexed color or RGB color. Whether you choose one over the other really 
depends on how well the image appears on your monitor. If you have some 
photos that you want to show on Web pages, you should use RGB images and 
save them in a format appropriate for Web hosting, as we explain in the sec-
tion “Saving files for the Web,” later in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and draw-
ings, you may find that the appearance of index colors is no different from 
the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the index color 
image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed 
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. A number of different options are 
available to you, and fortunately, you can preview the results while you make 
choices. Get in and poke around, and you can see the options applied in the 
image window.
Saving Files with Purpose
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats. Some 
format types require you to convert a color mode before the format can be 
used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file formats and saving files. 
Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file formats you 
can use when saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the 
conversions that you need to make in order to save in one format or another. 
If you do nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit 
depth, you can save a file after editing in the same format in which the file 
was opened. In many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for 
some form of output, which requires more thought about the kind of file 
format you use when saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place where 
you make choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you can save a 
duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the original file.

61
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be saved 
the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file, and a dialog box then opens.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in the 
Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options you find 
in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
 
✓ Filename: This item is common to all Save dialog boxes (Windows) or 
Save As (Macintosh). Type a name for your file in the text box.
 
✓ Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain 
the formats supported by Elements in the section “Understanding file 
formats,” later in this chapter.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ-
ent from other Save dialog boxes that you might be accustomed to using. The 
Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
 
✓ Include in the Organizer (Windows only): If you want the file added to 
the Organizer, select this check box. (For more information about using 
the Organizer, see Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Save in Version Set with Original (Windows only): You can edit images 
and save a version of your image, but only in Edit Quick mode. When 
you save the file from Edit Quick mode, this check box is active. Select 
the box to save a version of the original, which appears in the Organizer.
 
✓ Layers: If your file has layers, clicking this check box preserves the layers.
 
✓ As a copy: Use this option to save a copy without overwriting the 
original file.
 
✓ Color (Windows only): Select the box for ICC (International Color 
Consortium) Profile. Depending on which profile you’re using, the option 
appears for sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, 
the profile is embedded in the image. See Chapter 2 for more information 
on profiles.
 
✓ Thumbnail: If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a miniature 
representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on the desk-
top. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files preferences, the 
check box can be enabled or disabled. If you select an option for Never 
Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is enabled or 
disabled (and grayed out) for you. You need to return to the Preferences 
dialog box if you want to change the option.
 
✓ Use Lower Case Extension (Windows only): File extensions give you a 
clue to which file format was used when a file was saved. Elements auto-
matically adds the extension to the filename for you. Your choices are 
to use uppercase or lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the 
check box for Use Lower Case Extension for lowercase or deselect the 
check box if you want to use uppercase characters in the filename.

62
Part I: Getting Started 
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than when you’re 
saving files for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web, and the Save for Web 
dialog box opens. We explain all you need to know about how to use the Save 
for Web dialog box in Chapter 15.
Understanding file formats
When you save files in Elements, you need to pick a file format in the Format 
drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
 
When you choose from the different format options, keep the following infor-
mation in mind:
 
✓ File formats are especially important when you exchange files with other 
users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept or 
reject files depending on the format you choose.
 
✓ Whether you can select one format or another when you save a file 
depends on the color mode, the bit depth, and whether layers are pres-
ent. If a format isn’t present in the Format drop-down menu when you 
attempt to save a file, return to one of the edit modes and perform some 
kind of edit, such as changing a color mode or flattening layers, in order 
to save the file in your chosen format.
For a glimpse at all the file formats 
available to you, open a standard RGB 
color image in Edit Full mode, choose 
File➪Save As, and click the down 
arrow to open the Format drop-down 
menu. As you can see in Figure 3-11, 
you have many format options.
In the following sections, we explain 
most of the file formats supported by 
Elements and the purpose for each 
format.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format 
for both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements. The format supports 
saving all color modes and bit 
depths, and you can preserve layers. 
Figure 3-11: Open the Format drop-down 
menu in either the Save or Save As dialog box 
to make the formats supported by Elements 
appear.

63
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Use this format when you want to save in a native format or exchange files 
with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files that you need to return to 
for more editing. When you save layers, any text you add to layers can be 
edited when you return to the file. (See Chapter 13 for more information on 
adding text to an image.)
Alias PIX (Macintosh)
This format was introduced by Wavefront Technologies to import geometric 
data from ASCII files.
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type 
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. The 
bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. The 
Bitmap color mode, which we cover in the section “Converting to Bitmap 
mode,” earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black-and-white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources, 
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different 
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program docu-
ments, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Barb was a college coed, and Ted had a mustache and wore a green leisure 
suit, when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts. We exchanged 
files and mail on 300-baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe developed 
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between mainframe 
computers and the ever-growing number of users working on Osborne, 
Kaypro, Apple, and Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.
GIF is now a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be 
indexed color or animated images, and they support the smallest file sizes. 
Use this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and want to create 
animation in your images.
Photo Project Format (*.PSE)
Use this option when you create a project and want to save the file as a 
project. See Chapter 16 for more on creating projects in Elements.
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by 
graphic artists when they’re designing jobs for commercial printing. The 
more popular format for creative professionals is TIFF, but Photoshop EPS 
has some advantages not found in other formats.

64
Part I: Getting Started 
Depending on the color mode of your 
image, you have different options 
when you’re using the Photoshop 
EPS file format. Select the format in 
the Save/Save As dialog box and click 
Save. If you’re working on a bitmap 
image (1 bit), the EPS Options dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 3-12, opens. 
It offers an option to save transpar-
ency wherever white appears in your 
document.
Notice the Transparent Whites check box. You might have a circular logo 
for which you want the area around the circle to appear transparent. If you 
import the graphical image in another program, you can see the black in 
the image, and all the white area is transparent and shows any background 
through what was white in the original bitmap image. If you save a file in a 
higher bit depth, the EPS Options dialog box doesn’t provide an option for 
making whites transparent.
IFF (Macintosh)
A generic file format introduced by Electronic Arts to ease transfer of data 
between software produced by different companies.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file 
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many 
photo labs for printing files, and they can be viewed in JPEG viewers and 
directly in Web browsers. Just about every program capable of importing 
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of 
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format 
for all kinds of documents.
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. JPEG 
files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of several 
megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with JPEG com-
pression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your monitor, 
or it might appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low compres-
sion while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with maximum 
compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely notice image 
degradation.
 
When you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, each new save 
degrades an image more. If you need to submit JPEG images to photo labs 
for printing your pictures, keep saving in the Photoshop PSD file format until 
you’re ready to save the final image. Save in JPEG format when you want to 
save the final file for printing, and use a low compression with high quality.
Figure 3-12: When you’re working on 1-bit bit-
map images, this dialog box offers an option 
to save transparency where white appears 
in the document.

 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
When you select JPEG for the format 
and click Save, the JPEG Options 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 
3-13. You choose the amount of 
compression by typing a value in the 
Quality text box or by moving the 
slider below the Quality text box. 
The acceptable ranges are from 0 
to 12 — 0 is the lowest quality and 
results in the highest compression, 
and 12 is the highest quality that 
results in the lowest amount of 
compression.
Notice that you also have choices in 
the Format Options area of the JPEG 
Options dialog box. The Progressive 
option creates a progressive JPEG 
file commonly used with Web browsers. This file type shows progressive 
quality while the file downloads from a Web site. The image first appears in a 
low-quality view and shows higher-resolution views until the image appears 
at full resolution when it’s completely downloaded in your browser window.
PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs 
now support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX 
format. If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in 
Elements, edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is designed to maintain document 
integrity and exchange files between computers. PDF is one of the most popu-
lar formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program available 
for installation on your Elements CD installer or by downloading it from the 
Adobe Web site.
PDF is all over the place in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and 
create slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can export 
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you can 
preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other Acrobat 
viewers) and can be searched by using the Reader’s Find and Search tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users of 
Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for 
all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transparency, 
and for when you want to exchange files with users who don’t have Elements 
or Photoshop.

choose the amount of compression you want 
to apply to the saved image.

Part I: Getting Started 
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This format is used to exchange files between Windows and Mac users and 
mainframe computers. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes, 
don’t bother saving in this format.
PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is Apple’s answer to PCX on Windows. This format 
originated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the MacDraw pro-
gram. PICT files were helpful in the past for creating slides and video files on 
the Macintosh and for printing your images on film recorders that don’t use 
PostScript. The format is rarely used today.
PICT Resource (Macintosh)
PICT images are stored as a Macintosh resource type. Apple Computer ended 
support for PICT and PICT Resource in 2009. The format is essentially not 
used with images today but is available for opening legacy files.
Pixar (*.PXR)
This format is used for exchanging files with Pixar workstations.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages. 
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some older 
browsers, however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages. One 
disadvantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the 
images, like they can with JPEG. An advantage however, is that PNG uses loss-
less compression, resulting in images without degradation.
Scitex CT (*.SCT)
The Scitex Continuous Tone (CT) format is used by Scitex workstations in 
commercial printing environments.
Targa (*.TGA, *.VDA, *.ICB, *.VST)
Targa is a format for describing bitmap images and is capable of represent-
ing bitmaps from black and white, indexed color, and RGB color. It’s used for 
applications that can read Targa files, such as Truevision’s hardware.
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic 
designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in professional layout pro-
grams, such as Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker, and when commercial 

67
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports downloading TIFF 
files directly to their devices. (Note: Direct downloads are used in lieu of 
opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals have used TIFF for so long, a better 
choice for designers using a program such as Adobe InDesign is saving in the 
native Photoshop PSD file format. This requires a creative professional to 
save only one file in native format without bothering to save both native and 
TIFF formats.
TIFF, along with Photoshop PSD and Photoshop PDF, supports saving layered 
files and works in all color modes. When you save in TIFF format, you can 
also compress files in several different compression schemes, and compres-
sion with TIFF files doesn’t lose data unless you choose a JPEG compression.
When you select TIFF for the format and click Save in the Save/Save As dialog 
box, the TIFF Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-14.
In the Image Compression area, you have these choices:
 
✓ NONE: Selecting this option 
results in no compression. You 
use this option when sending 
files to creative professionals 
for creating layouts in programs 
such as Adobe InDesign. None 
of the compression schemes in 
the following bullets is recom-
mended for printing files to 
commercial printing devices.
 
✓ LZW: This lossless compression 
scheme results in much lower 
file sizes without destroying 
data.
 
✓ ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless com-
pression scheme. You can favor 
ZIP compression over LZW 
when you have large areas of 
the same color in an image.
 
✓ JPEG: JPEG is lossy and results 
in the smallest file sizes. Use 
JPEG here the same as when 
you apply JPEG compression 
with files saved in the JPEG 
format.
Figure 3-14: Choose TIFF from the Format 
drop-down menu and click Save to open the 
TIFF Options dialog box.

File formats at a glance
We’ve been working with Photoshop, which saves in the same formats listed 
in this section, since 1989. Yet we have never used all the formats available in 
Photoshop Elements. At most, you’ll use maybe three or four of these formats.
 
You don’t need to remember all the formats and what they do. Just pick the 
ones you use in your workflow, mark Table 3-3 for reference, and refer to it 
from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how files need 
to be prepared in order to save them in your desired formats. If you happen 
to receive a file from another user in one of the formats you don’t use, come 
back to the description in this chapter when you need some detail on what 
the format is used for.

*** CompuServe GIF doesn’t support saving layers, although it supports saving layers as frames. 
You use the frames when creating an animated GIF file used for Web pages.
Audio and video formats supported in Elements
In addition to the image formats listed in Table 3-3, Elements supports audio 
and video files. The support is limited to adding and viewing audio and video 
files in the Organizer (Windows) and printing the first frame in a video file. 
Other kinds of edits made to audio and video files require special software 
for audio and video editing.
Audio files can be imported in slide shows, as we explain in Chapter 15. The 
acceptable file formats for audio files are MP3, WAV, QuickTime, and WMA. If 
you have audio files in another format, you need to convert the file format. 
For these kinds of conversions, you can search the Internet for a shareware 
audio-conversion program.
Video files can also be imported in slide shows, as we discuss in Chapter 15. 
Elements supports the WMV (Windows) video format. Like with audio files, 
if videos are saved in other formats, such as Apple QuickTime (for Windows 
users), you need to convert the QT video format to WMV. For video-
conversion utilities, you can also find shareware programs to do the job. 
Search the Internet for a video converter.

Getting Organized

In this part . . .
T
he fi rst thing you want to do after opening the 
Photoshop Elements program is to access 
your photos from a digital camera, from your hard 
drive, or from your scanner. In this part, we talk 
about how to access your pictures and get them 
into Elements for editing. We talk about organizing 
your pictures by using many impressive organiz-
ing features in the program, as well as by search-
ing for photos, labeling them, and then creating 
different versions of the same picture. When it 
comes to organizing pictures, Elements is one of 
the best tools you can fi nd to keep your precious 
photos neatly cataloged and accessible.

In This Chapter
▶ Acquiring photos from cameras and card readers
▶ Scanning photos and artwork
▶ Importing photos from CDs, DVDs, and other media
▶ Working with online services
▶ Acquiring photos from cellphones
▶ Creating new documents
▶ Working with Camera Raw files
▶ Converting to 16-bit images
You have many different ways to import a picture into Elements, 
where you can play with it, experiment on it, and edit it. 
If you have a digital camera, you’re in the right place; we 
walk you through all kinds of different options for getting 
the shots you took with your camera into Elements.
If you have a digital scanner, you’re in the right 
place, too! We talk about scanning photos, as well. If 
you have CDs, sources of files on the Internet, some 
massive collection of images written to a DVD, or 
even a picture or two that you took with your cell-
phone, you’re still in the right place!
In Chapter 1, we flirt with opening files. If you 
followed the steps in those chapters for opening 
images, you should have a feel for using the Open tool 
and Open command. But there’s more to acquiring images 
than just using the Open command, as you can find out in 
this chapter.
This chapter covers all you need to know about getting images into Elements 
from all kinds of sources and explains how to move around the workspaces 
to get your files into Elements.

74
Part II: Getting Organized 
Grabbing Images from Your Camera
Copying photos from your digital camera to your computer so that you can 
work with them in Elements is simple if you’re familiar with your camera 
and the tools at your disposal. In the following sections, you find points to 
consider about choosing a resolution when you shoot your pictures, as well 
as how to use the Microsoft AutoPlay Wizard (Windows Vista) and Adobe 
Photoshop Elements 8.0 – Photo Downloader (Windows and Macintosh) after 
you hook up your camera to your computer.
Choosing a file format
When you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your 
images is an important point to consider. You choose this format on your 
camera before you take your pictures, and the format is carried over to your 
computer when you pull images off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer are JPEG and 
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer other options, but these two formats are 
the most common. Low-cost point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the JPEG 
format, and the more expensive cameras, including the SLR types, offer you 
both JPEG and Camera Raw:
 
✓ JPEG: Cameras that produce JPEG images process images with JPEG 
compression before saving them. It’s as though your camera performs a 
darkroom method of film processing when the shot is taken.
 
 We describe the JPEG file format in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Camera Raw: This format provides you with an optimum image for edit-
ing in Elements. When a Camera Raw image is saved to a media source, 
all the information the sensor captured is saved with the file. These 
images are post-processed when you open them. (See the “A Basic 
Primer on Camera Raw” section, later in this chapter, to find out about 
opening Camera Raw images.) For example, you can open a Camera Raw 
image and, before the image opens in Elements, adjust temperature, 
exposure, and a bunch of other settings. You can return to the original 
Camera Raw file and change the temperature or exposure, for example, 
to open the file with different settings. Just like chemical temperature 
and development time affect analog film processing, similar options 
affect post-processing Camera Raw images. The difference between 
analog film and Camera Raw is that after your analog film is processed, 
you can’t change the processing attributes. With Camera Raw, you can 
go back and post-process the image as many times as you want and 
change the processing attributes each time.
 
 Camera Raw also supports higher-bit-depth images than JPEG files do. 
For more understanding of higher bit-depth images, see Chapter 3.

75
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw, 
always choose the latter. You have much more editing control over your 
images, and ultimately, you get better results.
Using the AutoPlay Wizard
Microsoft AutoPlay Wizard may launch automatically when your computer 
is connected to a media source. You can use the wizard to download images 
from your media source to your computer.
On the Macintosh the Adobe Bridge CS4 – Photo Downloader can be launched 
automatically when you connect a camera or card reader to your computer. 
You can also open folders on a camera or card reader and copy folders to your 
hard disk. Adobe Bridge can be used to open folders on your computer, so the 
downloader is not necessary to organize photos in the Bridge window.
To copy images from a media source or when your camera is connected to 
your computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
 
 Connect your camera or external media reader to your computer, or 
insert a media source into a port or drive on your computer. The meth-
ods available to you should be detailed in the user’s guide that shipped 
with your camera.
 
 When you connect your media to your computer, a dialog box opens, 
providing options for how to handle the media.
 
2. Under General Options, click Open Folder to View Files Using 
Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
3. Open the folder containing images on the media card.
 
 You might find a folder listed as DCIM or another name when you open 
the media card in Windows Explorer. Double-click the folder name to 
open the folder.
 
4. Select folders in Windows Explorer and drag them to a folder on your 
hard drive to copy them to your computer.
 
 The images are copied to the target folder.
 
You can set preferences for AutoPlay by clicking the Set AutoPlay Defaults in 
Control Panel link in the AutoPlay dialog box. When you open the Control 
Panel preferences, you can choose from a number of options for handling 
media, as shown in Figure 4-2. If you want to prevent the AutoPlay Wizard 
from automatically opening, you can select Take No Actions from the media 
types drop-down menus.

 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
Using Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 – 
Photo Downloader
The Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 – Photo Downloader (Windows) or the 
Adobe Bridge CS4 – Photo Downloader (Macintosh) is installed with your 
Elements program. Photo Downloader acquires images from digital cameras 
connected to your computer, from card readers, and from card reader ports 
on your computer. On Windows, Photo Downloader is an alternative applica-
tion to Microsoft AutoPlay.
To use the Adobe Photoshop 8.0 – Photo Downloader on Windows, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
 
2. Click Cancel in the Microsoft AutoPlay Wizard (Windows).
 
 Because the wizard auto-launches, the opening pane appears when 
you make a connection between your camera media source and your 
computer. To bail out of the wizard, click Cancel.
 
3. Open the Organizer and choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪
From Camera or Card Reader.
 
4. In the Photo Downloader, shown in Figure 4-3, click the Get Photos 
button to copy all the files to your hard drive.
 
5. If you want to copy a select 
group of files to your hard 
drive, click the Advanced 
Dialog button in the Photo 
Downloader Standard 
dialog box.
 
 The Advanced dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
6. Remove check marks from all 
photos you don’t want to copy 
to your hard drive.
 
 By default, all photos are 
selected in a box below the 
photo thumbnails.
 
7. Click Get Photos to copy the 
selected photos to your hard 
drive.
Figure 4-3: The Photo Downloader enables you 
to copy files from a media card to your hard 
drive.

78
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
 Immediately after you make your selection, the Organizer window 
opens (if you selected the box for Open Organizer When Finished in the 
Standard dialog box). All the photos downloaded to your hard drive 
appear in a new Organizer window.
Figure 4-4: Click Advanced Dialog to open the Advanced dialog box, where you can 
selectively copy photos to your hard drive.
 
To simplify the process, stick with using one tool to acquire your digital 
camera images — either the Microsoft AutoPlay or the Adobe Photo 
Download Manager.
Getting Photos in Adobe Bridge (Macintosh)
Adobe Bridge on the Macintosh is your alternative to the Organizer on 
Windows. You can click the Get Photos icon at the top of the Bridge window 
to open the Adobe Bridge CS4 – Photo Downloader dialog and choose to copy 
images via the downloader. An alternative on the Macintosh is to simply copy 
a folder of photos from a camera, card reader, CD-ROM, or any media device 
to your hard disk.

79
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
The Macintosh version of Elements doesn’t use a catalog and therefore, you 
don’t need to add images to a catalog like you do when using the Organizer 
on Windows. Bridge can be used to explore and view photos in any folder on 
your hard disk. For the simplest solution, drag folders of photos to your hard 
disk and in Adobe Bridge, navigate to the folders to view image thumbnails in 
the window.
Resizing images from digital cameras
Depending on your camera and the camera settings you use, you may need 
to resize your images after you download them. Many cameras take pictures 
at 72 ppi, but the physical size of the image varies according to the resolution 
that the camera LCD is capable of acquiring. You’ll frequently need to resize 
images taken with your digital camera. For more more information on resiz-
ing images, see Chapter 3.
Using a Scanner
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers. 
Unless you have a SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) device, which is 
another type of connection port but almost nonexistent today, you use either 
USB or FireWire. Most low-end scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little 
more data in the shadows and highlights. Like with a digital camera, a scan-
ner’s price is normally in proportion with its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you’d clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selections 
before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things ahead of 
time before scanning:
 
✓ Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections 
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with 
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts 
and remove them according to the instructions.
 
✓ Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and glass cleaner 
(applied to the cloth) to remove all dust and particles on the glass. The 
more dust particles you remove, the easier the job of editing your image 
in Elements.
 
✓ Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to 
scan is free of dust and spots.

80
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
 If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or 
debris that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film 
in photo flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo reseller). Be certain 
that your hands are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fingers 
to remove the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with hot 
water only and hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s dry, 
and you should see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your 
soiled original.
 
✓ Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the 
software supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the 
options in this software before it finally drops into an Elements image 
window.
 
✓ Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam-
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece 
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe 
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo-
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier by 
using darker settings.
 
✓ Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you can 
acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To find 
the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet spot 
is the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be darker. 
The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the lower-right 
quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan to place 
your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution 
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output 
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accom-
modate a given output. Some considerations include the following:
 
✓ Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final 
output. If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a 
Web page, scan the original with a 50-percent reduction in size at 72 ppi. 
(See Chapter 3 for information about resizing images.)
 
✓ Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that 
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 
inches, scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200 
percent for a 300 dpi image).
 
✓ Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only. When 
you print line art on laser printers or prepare files for commercial 
printing, the line art resolution should match the device resolution. For 
example, printing to a 600 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer requires 

81
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
600 ppi for a 1-bit line-art image. When you’re printing to an image setter 
at a print shop, or when an image is going directly to plate or press, the 
resolution should be 1200 dpi.
 
✓ Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but 
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning 
in RGB (red, green, and blue) color and converting to grayscale by using 
the Hue/Saturation dialog box or the Convert to Black and White dialog 
box, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16- or 
32-bit, by all means, scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most 
data. See Chapter 3 for more information about working with higher-bit 
images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a standalone application 
and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are 
designed to work inside other software programs, such as Photoshop 
Elements. When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements 
to do all your scanning. Here’s how it works:
 
1. After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, 
launch Elements and then open the Organizer (Windows) by clicking 
Organize on the Welcome screen.
 
2. From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing 
Ctrl+K.
 
3. Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences, 
as we describe in Chapter 2.
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con-
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Here’s how to complete 
your scan:
 
1. To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪
Get Photos➪From Scanner (Windows).
 
 You must be in the Organizer window on Windows to access the File➪
Get Photos➪From Scanner menu command. 
 
2. In the Get Photos from Scanner dialog box that appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-5, make your choices and click OK. 
 
 Here you make a choice for your scanner in the Scanner drop-down 
menu, a location on your hard drive for saving the scanned images, a 
quality setting, and an option to automatically correct red-eye. 

82
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
 Elements may churn a bit, 
but eventually your scanner 
software appears atop the 
Organizer window, as you can 
see in Figure 4-6. The window is 
the scanner software provided 
by your scanner manufacturer. 
(Your window looks different 
than Figure 4-6 unless you use 
the same scanner we use.) 
 
3. Preview the scan.
 
 Regardless of which software 
you use, you should have 
similar options for creating a 
preview; selecting resolution, 
color mode, and image size; scaling; and other options. Click the Preview 
button and you see a preview before scanning the photo(s).
 
4. Adjust the options according to your output requirements and the rec-
ommendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
 
5. When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button.
 
 The final image drops into an Elements image window.
Scanning many 
photos at a time
If you have several photos 
to scan, you can lay them 
out on the scanner platen 
and perform a single scan 
to acquire all images in 
one pass. Arrange the 
photos to scan on the 
glass and set up all the 
options in the scanner 
window for your intended 
output. When you scan 
multiple images, they 
form a single scan, as you 
can see in Figure 4-7.
Figure 4-5: Make choices in the Get Photos 
from Scanner dialog box and click OK.
Figure 4-6: When you scan from within Elements, your 
scanner software loads on top of the Elements workspace.

83
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
After you scan multiple 
images, Elements makes it 
easy for you to separate 
each image into its own 
image window, where you 
can save the images as 
separate files. In Edit Full 
mode, choose Image➪
Divide Scanned Photos to 
make Elements magically 
open each image in a sep-
arate window while your 
original scan remains 
intact. The images are 
neatly tucked away in 
the Project Bin, where 
you can select them for 
editing, as shown in 
Figure 4-8.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Getting Files from Storage Media
When you acquire images in Elements from media sources, such as CD-ROMs, 
DVDs, external hard drives, and your internal hard drive, the process is very 
similar to opening files from digital cameras, which we explain in the section, 
“Grabbing Images from Your Camera,” earlier in this chapter. Insert a CD or 
DVD into the CD/DVD drive, and the Windows AutoPlay Wizard opens just 
like when you insert a media cartridge or connect a cable from your camera 
to your computer.
Likewise, you can also open these files in the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe 
Bridge (Macintosh). Just cancel out of the wizard and follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh) from the 
Welcome screen or click Photo Browser (Windows) or Browse with 
Bridge (Macintosh) from one of the editing modes.
 
2. When the Organizer window opens, choose File➪Get Photos➪From 
Files and Folders (Windows). On the Macintosh, you can create a new 
folder and simply drag photos from the media source to your new 
folder.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose File➪Open or press Ctrl+O (Ô+O on the 
Macintosh). The Open dialog box opens.
 
3. Open the source drive from the listed drives.
 
 You see the photos stored on the media.
 
4. Select images and click Get Photos (from the Organizer) or Open 
(from one of the editing modes) to open the files in the Organizer or 
an editor.
 
 Now, you can edit the photos in Elements or save them to your hard drive.
Using Online Services (Windows)
Online printing and sharing services require you to set up an account with 
a service. You can access services provided by Adobe Partner Services by 
clicking the Share tab above the Panels Bin in the Organizer and clicking 
either Order Prints or Online Album. To use a service, you begin by setting 
up an account, as we explain in Chapter 2.
You can create digital photo albums with your images and share them with 
friends, family, and coworkers. To initiate a sharing service, you send an e-mail 
invitation to others. Each member of your sharing group needs to set up an 
account individually. After everyone has an account, you and your friends can 

85
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
then order prints that are mailed from the online service center. All the kinds 
of prints you might order from a local superstore or photo lab are available 
from online services, including specialty items, such as calendars.
After setting up an account and choosing a service, you handle sharing 
services by using the Share panels, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Phoning In Your Images
If you want to add images from a cellphone to the Organizer or Adobe Bridge 
or open images in one of the editing modes, you need to copy files via a USB 
or Bluetooth connection or e-mail photos if your phone is cabable of using 
e-mail.
After copying files to your hard drive on Windows, choose File➪Get Photos 
and Video➪From Files and Folders or press Ctrl +G (Ô+G on the Mac). Locate 
the folder into which you copied the files and add them to your Organizer or 
open them in one of the editing modes. On the Macintosh, open the folder in 
Bridge.
Creating Images from Scratch
You may want to start from scratch by creating a new document in Elements. 
New, blank pages have a number of uses. You can mix and merge images in 
a new document, as we explain in Chapter 8; create a canvas where you can 
draw and paint, as we explain in Chapter 12; or use the New dialog box to find 
out a file’s size, dimensions, and resolution.
Creating a new document
You can create new, blank documents by using one of several options. On the 
Welcome screen, which appears when you first launch Elements, click Edit 
to launch the Edit Full mode. Choose File➪New Blank File to open the New 
dialog box, in which you choose the document size, resolution, and other 
attributes. You can also click the New button on the Macintosh at the top 
of the Edit Full window. Likewise, you can create new files while working in 
either Edit Quick mode or in the Organizer (Windows).
Follow these steps to create a new document while working in any editing 
mode:
 
1. Open Elements and select an editing mode.
 
 Click Edit (Start from Scratch on the Macintosh) on the Welcome screen.

86
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Blank File in any workspace or press Ctrl+N.
 
 Either way, the New dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.
 
3. Select the attributes for the new file.
 
 You have several options from which to choose:
 
• Name: Type a name for your file.
 
• Preset: From the drop-down list, you can select from a number of 
different sizes.
 
• Size: You can select a preset size from a long drop-down list. This 
is optional because you can change the file attributes in the other 
text boxes and drop-down menus.
 
• Dimensions (Width/Height): Values in the Width and Height text 
boxes are independent. Either box can be edited without affecting 
the other. Adjacent to the values in the Width and Height text 
boxes, you find drop-down menus that offer many different options 
for units of measure, such as the default units of pixels followed 
by inches, centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), points, picas, and 
columns.
 
• Resolution: Resolution here is similar to editing the resolution 
value in the Image Size dialog box when the Resample check box 
is selected. The resolution is an independent value and isn’t linked 
to the dimensions. If you want to know how resolution changes 
dimensions without resampling, create a new, blank file at the 
known values and click OK. Then, choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size and change the values in the Image Size dialog box, which we 
discuss in Chapter 3.
 
• Color Mode: Your choices are Bitmap, Grayscale, and RGB. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information about color modes.)
 
• Background Contents: You 
have three choices: White, 
Background Color, and 
Transparent. The selection 
you make results in the 
color of the blank image. 
If you choose Background 
Color, the current back-
ground color assigned on 
the Tools panel is applied 
to the background. See 
Chapter 12 for information 
on changing background 
color. If you choose 
Transparent, the image is created as a layer, and the layer name 
changes to Layer 0, as we explain in Chapter 8.
Figure 4-9: Regardless of the method used to 
create a new, blank document, the New dialog 
box opens.

87
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
• Image Size: This value (displayed in the lower-right corner of the 
dialog box) dynamically changes when you change the Width, 
Height, and Resolution values. The reported value is how much file 
space is required to save the uncompressed file.
 
4. Click OK after setting the file attributes to create the new document.
Finding file specs in the New dialog box
In addition to creating new, blank files, the New dialog box can be a helpful 
source of information for all your work in Elements. Suppose that you want 
to know how many images you can copy to a 2656MB USB storage device or 
how large your digital camera files will print with a 150 ppi resolution. All 
you have to do is press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on the Mac) to open the New dialog box, 
plug in the values, and read the Image Size number or examine the file dimen-
sions. If your files will be converted to grayscale, choose Grayscale from the 
Color Mode drop-down menu and check the Image Size number to see how 
much your file size is reduced. Because this number is dynamic, it changes 
with each change you make to the file attributes.
Adding pages to an existing project (Windows)
Rather than create a new, blank file, you can add pages to an existing file in 
the form of a project. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image in Edit Full mode.
 
2. Right-click the photo thumbnail in the 
Project Bin. By default, the Project Bin 
opens.
 
 The context menu, as shown in Figure 4-10, 
appears.
 
3. Choose either Add Blank Page (for adding 
a new, blank page) or Add Page Using 
Current Layout (to duplicate the current 
photo as a new page).
 
4. Save the file by choosing File➪Save As and 
selecting Photoshop Multiple Project as 
your file format.
 
 Note that the default format in the Save As 
dialog box is Photo Project Format (*.PSE).
 
 All the pages you add to a project are saved 
as separate files in a folder created automati-
cally by Elements. When you open any one 
of the images, it appears separately in the 
Project Bin. To open an image in the stack, 
Figure 4-10: Right-click and 
then choose an option for 
adding a page to the photo 
selected in the Project Bin.

88
Part II: Getting Organized 
click the image you want to open in the Project Bin. Clicking an image in 
the Project Bin opens that image in the image window.
 
 In Figure 4-11, you 
can see thumbnails 
of a project where 
the original RGB 
image appears on 
the left, followed by 
a grayscale image, a 
sepia-tone image, and 
a bitmap image — all 
contained in the same 
photo project.
A Basic Primer on Camera Raw
We include the elaborate description of Camera Raw in the following sections, 
after sharing with you all the other options you have for getting images in 
Elements. We recognize that you may not have a digital camera capable of 
capturing Camera Raw images, so this information may not be of much interest 
to you now.
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you 
might want to look over the following sections to understand how this file 
format can benefit you. If you purchase a camera equipped with Camera Raw 
support, you’ll have some understanding of the advantages of using this 
format.
Understanding Camera Raw
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you take 
a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sensor 
records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file in 
Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose that your camera is set for exposure in tungsten lighting, which is 
used with tungsten flash photography in a studio. If you take this camera out-
side in daylight and shoot an image, all your images appear with a blue cast 
because tungsten lighting produces a cooler temperature than daylight.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you need to do a lot of 
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in 
Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer temperature 
(consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color correc-
tion in Elements is a fraction of what it is to fix a JPEG image.
Figure 4-11: Click one of the thumbnails in the Project Bin to 
open the respective photo in the image window.

89
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed with 
Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera 
Raw plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements editors.
 
Each camera developer uses a different flavor of Camera Raw, and some 
developers use different Raw formats between different models in their prod-
uct line. Although Adobe tries to keep up with all the various Raw formats, 
you may find a camera using a format not supported by the Raw plug-in. Be 
sure to check updates online for Photoshop Elements. As new developments 
occur, Adobe makes an effort to update plug-ins to support newer formats.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through the first part of this chapter, you know how to acquire 
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We don’t bother 
going through those steps again; we just assume that you have some Camera 
Raw images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them, anyway. Opening 
files from your hard drive is much faster than working off media cards.
To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the image by pressing Ctrl+O (Ô+O on the Mac from within 
Adobe Bridge) and selecting the image in the Open dialog box.
 
 If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold 
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select 
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl-click each image (Ô-click on the Mac).
 
 On the Macintosh you must open the file in Camera Raw using Adobe 
Bridge. If you open a file from Edit Full mode and choose Camera Raw as 
the file format, the photo won’t open in the raw converter.
 
2. Click Open in the Open dialog box.
 
 If you’re selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the 
Camera Raw dialog box. When you click Open Image, the next image 
opens in the Camera Raw dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-12.
 
 As you can see in Figure 4-12, you can use a vast number of options to 
post-process your image before you drop it into Elements. This window 
is like a digital darkroom, where you can process the film and see what 
you’re doing to the image before you accept the changes.
 
3. Choose from the options to post-process your images.
 
 If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we explain in Chapter 
2, all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are dynamically 
updated in the image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around and adjust set-
tings to see the results in the preview area. The more you play with the 
settings, the more you find out how to get the best out of Camera Raw.

90
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 4-12: Open a Camera Raw image, and the image opens in the Camera Raw 
plug-in window.
A large number of settings are in the Camera Raw window, as the following 
list describes; mark this section to refer to when you work with Camera Raw 
images:
 
✓ Tools: Nine tools appear in the window:
 
• Zoom: Zooms in and out of the image preview.
 
• Hand: Moves the image around, like it does in the Elements image 
window.
 
• Eyedropper: Samples color in the image. We cover using the 
Elements Eyedropper tools in Chapter 12, and that information 
also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw window.
 
• Crop tool: Draw a marquee with the Crop tool and make your color 
and brightness adjustments. The adjustments are applied only to 
the area defined by the Crop tool. When you click Open Image, the 
photo opens cropped to the area you marked with the Crop tool.
 
• Straighten tool: The Straighten tool enables you to draw a horizontal 
axis to straighten a crooked photo.

91
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
• Red Eye Removal: Click the Red Eye Removal tool to remove red-
eye caused by flash lighting.
 
• Open Preferences dialog box: Click this tool to open the Camera 
Raw Preferences dialog box, where you can make some choices for 
saving image settings, change default image settings, and use the 
Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) format. You can press Ctrl+K (Ô+K 
on the Macintosh) to open this dialog box.
 
• Rotate Left: This tool appears first to rotate counterclockwise.
 
• Rotate Right: The last tool you see below the title bar is used to 
rotate clockwise. These last two rotation tools are self-explanatory.
 
✓ Preview: Select the box to show dynamic previews of your edits.
 
✓ Shadow/Highlight Clipping: The Shadow and Highlight buttons above 
the histogram denoted by up-pointing arrows show clipping in the shad-
ows (dark areas of the image) and highlights (light areas of the image). 
Clipping means that, in a certain area, some data and, ultimately, some 
detail have been lost in an image. Think of clipping as something that 
you don’t want to appear in your pictures. When you make adjustments 
with these two check boxes selected, shadow clipping is shown in blue 
and highlight clipping is shown in red in the image preview. Take a look 
at Figure 4-13, in which we exaggerate clipping to show how the clipping 
preview appears.
 
✓ RGB values: These values appear below the histogram. When you first 
open an image, you don’t see any values in the RGB area. Click the 
Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper tool and move the cursor 
over the image preview. When you move any of these tools around the 
image, the RGB values corresponding to the point below the cursor are 
reported in this area.
 
✓ Histogram: This graph displays 
all three channels (red, green, 
and blue) in an image simultane-
ously. The histogram changes 
when you change other options 
in the Camera Raw window.
 
 The histogram graphs how 
pixels in an image are distrib-
uted. The distribution includes 
the number of pixels at each 
color-intensity level (one of 
the 256 levels you can find out 
about in Chapter 3).
Figure 4-13: Shadow clipping appears in red, 
and highlight clipping appears in blue.

92
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
 If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you see the histo-
gram skewed to the left. Conversely, images with pixels concentrated in 
the highlights reveal a histogram skewed to the right.
 
 When you begin to understand histograms better, you can develop your 
skill to the point where a quick glance at the histogram provides you 
with a clue to what adjustments you need to make to improve images.
 
✓ Detail icons: The three icons change the pane below the histogram. The 
Basic choices are shown in Figure 4-12. Click the Detail icon to apply 
sharpening and noise reduction, as shown in Figure 4-14, or click the 
Camera Calibration icon to select a camera profile.
 
✓ Settings (pop-up menu): This pop-up menu opens when you click the 
small icon on the far right of the Basic tab. From this menu, you have 
choices for applying settings to the open image. If you change any set-
ting, the menu option changes to Custom. If you previously made setting 
choices on a Camera Raw image and want to return to the shot as it was 
taken by the camera, open the image and select Camera Raw Defaults.
 
 
Another option is Previous Conversion. 
This selection is handy if you have a col-
lection of images that all require the same 
settings. After adjusting the first image, 
open additional images and select Previous 
Conversion. The Camera Raw plug-in applies 
the last settings you made to a Camera Raw 
image to the currently open file.
 
 Sharpening sharpens images. You can 
choose to sharpen images in the Camera Raw 
window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharp-
ening here and use the sharpening tools in 
Elements, as we explain in Chapter 9.
 
 Noise Reduction includes options for 
adjusting the luminance and color. You’ve 
probably seen images with a lot of noise. In 
extreme cases, they look like the pictures 
were printed on sandpaper. Noise in an 
image is okay if that’s an effect you inten-
tionally apply to a picture. However, if you 
want a smooth-looking image, you have 
to eliminate any noise introduced by the 
camera. Luminance Smoothing reduces gray-
scale noise. The next setting is Color Noise 
Reduction, which is used to reduce color 
noise.
Figure 4-14: Click the triangle 
icon below the histogram to 
open the Detail tab, which 
includes options for sharpness 
and noise reduction.

93
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
✓ White Balance: White Balance settings (available on the Basic tab — the 
far-left icon below the histogram, as shown in Figure 4-12) are used to 
adjust the color balance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions 
under which the shot was originally taken. Think of the sensor in a digi-
tal camera capable of capturing the entire range of white balance the 
sensor can see. You make a choice not necessarily for what you see, but 
rather for the white balance for the shot you took. Therefore, if your 
camera is set for taking pictures under one set of lighting conditions, 
then you move to another set of lighting conditions and forget to change 
the settings, you can let the Camera Raw plug-in make a correction 
for the white balance because the sensor picked up the entire range, 
and the necessary data is contained in the file.
 
 In Figure 4-15, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung-
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. By changing 
the White Balance in the Camera Raw dialog box, you can see how the 
settings affect the image color.
Figure 4-15: Changing White Balance can dramatically change the image color.

94
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite 
do the job, you can move the Temperature slider or edit the text box to 
settle on values between one White Balance choice and another. Use this 
item to fine-tune the White Balance.
 
✓ Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance. 
This slider and text box are used to correct any green or magenta tints 
that might appear in a photo.
 
✓ Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes help 
you control the image brightness and tonal range. Notice the Exposure 
setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at the wrong exposure. 
In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to push or pull film 
during processing, which results in longer and shorter processing times. 
Changing exposure times compensates for under- and overexposing 
film. A nice advantage of using Camera Raw is that you can change the 
exposure for one image and then later open the original raw image and 
change to a different exposure value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed, 
but with Camera Raw, you can reprocess over and over again.
 
 Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the 
choices you have in the Elements Edit Full mode. For more information 
on these adjustments, see Chapter 10.
 
✓ Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button 
you see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt key, and the button changes 
to Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made and start over, 
press Alt and click Reset.
 
✓ Open Image/Open Copy: This single button has two different purposes:
 
• Open Image: This button is the default. Click Open after you 
choose all your settings to process the photo and open it in 
Elements.
 
• Open Copy: Press the Alt key, and the button changes to Open 
Copy. Click Open Copy to open a copy of the raw image.
 
✓ Done: Clicking Done doesn’t open the image in Edit Full mode. Click 
Done after making changes to the settings, and the new settings become 
the new defaults for your Raw image. You can clear the defaults by open-
ing the pop-up menu and selecting Camera Raw Defaults.
 
✓ Zoom: In this drop-down menu, you can choose from several zoom pre-
sets. You can also edit the text box, click the minus (–) button to zoom 
out, or click the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option zooms the 
image preview.
 
✓ Help: Clicking this button opens a Help document to assist you in under-
standing more about Camera Raw.

95
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
 
✓ Save Image: Click the Save Image button to open the Save Options 
dialog box, where you can rename the image to save a copy and make 
choices for saving in Adobe’s DNG format.
 
✓ Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths, they’re 
listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing, you can 
select the option from the drop-down menu.
 
✓ Spot Removal tool: Use this tool to remove dust and scratches before 
opening the file in Elements.
 
✓ Adjustment Brush tool: Use this tool to adjust brightness, contrast, and 
color to sections of the image before opening in Elements.
All we can hope to provide in this book is a simple cursory view for using 
Camera Raw. Several entire books have been written exclusively covering the 
Camera Raw format and how to open files in the Camera Raw plug-in window. 
For a more detailed look at using Camera Raw, see Color Management for 
Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).

Viewing and Finding Your Images
In This Chapter
▶ Viewing photos in the Organizer
▶ Viewing photos in Adobe Bridge
▶ Navigating the image window
▶ Sorting photos
▶ Searching for photos
T
he Organizer is a powerful tool that helps you locate files and keeps your 
photos arranged and organized. You can easily access the Organizer in 
Windows by clicking the Organizer button on the menu bar while you’re in 
one of the editing modes. Or when you open the Welcome screen, click the 
Organize button.
If you’re a Macintosh user, you don’t have the Organizer 
available in Elements. The Macintosh alternative to the 
Organizer is Adobe Bridge — a powerful photo orga-
nizer that permits you to view photos in folders at a 
glance.
In this chapter, you can discover how to view and 
organize your pictures in the Organizer, Adobe 
Bridge, and the image window, and how the many 
options help speed up your work in Photoshop 
Elements.
The Many Faces of the Organizer 
(Windows)
The default Organizer view is like a slide sorter, and this view is one you’re 
likely to use in all your Elements work sessions. The Organizer provides an 
efficient means to access the photos you want to open in one of the editors. 

98
Part II: Getting Organized 
Just double-click a photo in the Organizer, and you see the image zoom in 
size to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully examine the photo to be 
certain that it’s the one you want and then just select which editor you want 
to use from the Editor drop-down list on the menu bar, from the context 
menu you open on the image in the Organizer window, or by clicking the Fix 
button in the Panels Bin.
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you have other ways to view 
your pictures: in a slide show or side-by-side to compare them.
Adding files to the default Organizer view
Before you explore alternative viewing options in the Organizer, take a look 
at how you add photos to the thumbnail images you see in the Organizer 
window.
After copying the photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Chapter 4, 
here’s how you add those files to an existing group of images in the 
Organizer:
 
1. Open the Organizer (Windows).
 
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and 
Folders.
 
 The Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 5-1.
View menu
Figure 5-1: The Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box.

99
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
3. From the View menu (shown in Figure 5-1), choose Large icons (or 
Medium icons).
 
 In Large icon (or Medium icon) view, thumbnail images of most files 
appear in a scrollable list large enough to see some detail. (Note: 
You might not see Camera Raw files and some files saved in different 
formats.) This view makes it easy to locate the files you want to add 
to the Organizer. For example, if you want to load only Camera Raw 
images, you can easily see them represented as icons, rather than the 
image previews.
 
4. Select files to add to the Organizer window.
 
 Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl key to select 
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos 
between the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift-click are 
selected. When you Ctrl-click, you can select additional noncontiguous 
photos.
 
5. Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer window.
 
6. To view all photos (new and old), click the Back button on the 
Shortcuts bar.
 
 The photos you add to the Organizer may appear out of order when 
you’re viewing them in the Organizer. Depending on the sort order, 
which we explain in the section “Sorting Your Photos,” later in this chap-
ter, the additional photos you add to the Organizer can appear before or 
after, or integrated within, the original photos. Use the scroll bar in the 
Organizer to view the added photos.
Changing the Organizer display
When you open the Organizer, the default view is a Thumbnail display. 
Your photos, videos, projects, audio files, and so on are shown with a mini 
image or icon that can be adjusted to different sizes. On the Shortcuts bar, 
a slider can be moved left to create 
smaller thumbnail views or right to 
create larger thumbnail views in the 
Organizer window.
The Thumbnail display is one of 
many options for browsing photos 
and other files in the Organizer. A 
quick glance at the Display drop-
down menu shows alternative views 
available to you, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2: Click Display on the menu bar to 
see the options for alternative views in the 
Organizer.

100
Part II: Getting Organized 
Import Batch view
Below the default option for Thumbnail views, you find Import Batch. Open 
the Display menu and then select Import Batch, or press Ctrl+Alt+2 on your 
keyboard. The display in the Organizer keeps the view set to thumbnails, but 
the order of your files changes to reflect the date you imported files with the 
Get Photos and Videos command, which we discuss in Chapter 4. This view 
can be helpful if you want to organize images according to the dates you 
imported them.
Folder Location view
What’s nifty about the Folder Location display is that you can peruse your 
hard drive for all files and folders while you remain in the Organizer window. 
Just select Folder Location from the Display menu or press Ctrl+Alt+3 to 
make an Explorer sidebar show you your hard drive(s), network locations, 
and offline media.
Choose Folder Location to change the view to the one shown in Figure 5-3. 
When you want to poke around a folder, right-click and select Reveal in 
Explorer from the context menu. Windows Explorer opens on top of the 
Organizer window and shows you all the files contained in that folder.
Figure 5-3: Choose Folder Location from the Display menu and then right-click to open a 
context menu.

101
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
When you find an image you want to edit, right-click and choose Open With➪
Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 (Editor). The image then opens in Edit Full 
mode in Elements.
 
When you want more of the screen window dedicated to seeing the files in 
the Organizer, hide the Panels Bin by clicking the separator bar. One click on 
the tiny right-pointing arrow on the separator bar hides the panel. Click the 
arrow on a collapsed panel to reopen that panel. In Figure 5-3, you see the 
Organizer window with the Panels Bin hidden, thereby displaying more 
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
Date view
Choose Date View (Ctrl+Alt+D) from the Display menu to change your 
Organizer window to a calendar showing you the dates your images were 
shot. The date information is derived from metadata imported with your 
images that were recorded by your camera. (For 
more information on metadata, see “Searching 
metadata,” later in this chapter.)
If you shoot many pictures on a given date, the 
images are stacked on the calendar for that date. 
In the right panel, you find arrows that are used 
to scroll the stacked images left or right, and a 
number appears in the lower-left corner of the 
image thumbnail in view. In Figure 5-4, the num-
bers appear as 5 of 6; on April 13, 2008 (the date 
at the top of the thumbnail), six photos were 
taken, and the current view is the fifth photo in 
the stacked order.
To return to the Organizer thumbnail display, 
click the binoculars icon or press Ctrl+Alt+O (the 
letter O, not zero).
Show Map
How would you like to see a visual display of where your photos were taken 
geographically? Photoshop Elements provides you the answer with Yahoo! 
Maps and an option for placing your photos on a world map.
To open Yahoo! Maps in Elements, open the Display menu in the Shortcuts 
bar and choose Show Map. The Map panel on the left side of the Organizer 
window opens, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
You must have an Internet connection active on your computer to work with 
Yahoo! Maps.
Figure 5-4: The right panel 
shows a thumbnail view of a 
photo with scroll arrows and 
numbers.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 5-5: Choose Show Map from the Display menu to open Yahoo! Maps.
To map the location of photos shown in the Organizer to Yahoo! Maps, you 
can choose from a couple different options:
 
✓ Select photos in the Organizer and drag them to a map location on the 
map in the Map panel.
 
✓ Select photos in the Organizer and right-click one of the selected 
photos. From the menu options, choose Place on Map. In the dialog box 
that opens, type a city name and click the Find button. If more than one 
city is reported in the dialog box, click the city name you want to use for 
the mapped photos.
To move around the map, place the cursor inside the Yahoo! Map panel and 
drag the map with the Hand tool within the panel window. If you go too far 
left, don’t worry; the Asian, Indian, and Eastern European countries are found 
by dragging right across the Atlantic and eastward. Dragging left stops some-
where around the International Date Line; so, if you live in Singapore, you 
need to keep dragging right to find your country.
Zooming in the Map panel is handled by the tools you see at the bottom of 
the map. Use the Zoom In tool to find cities and road maps in a detailed view. 
Use the Zoom Out tool after you find the location you want to use.

103
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
After you add photos to the map, you can view the images by clicking the 
red pin placed on the map each time that you add photos to a location. Click 
the red pin to open a pop-up window that shows a thumbnail view of the 
current photo with smaller photos in a slide organizer below the primary 
image thumbnail, as shown in Figure 5-6. Click the left and right arrows in the 
pop-up window to scroll the slides. Clicking the current image thumbnail in 
the pop-up window opens the image in a slide show view. To find out more 
about slide show views, see the following section.
In the Map panel, you can choose 
from several display options in the 
drop-down menu on the bottom-
right side of the panel. Choose from 
the default Map, a Hybrid map, or 
Satellite map. Choose Satellite to 
locate Uncle Jeremy’s house, where 
the last family reunion took place 
and you shot all those wonderful 
pictures.
To close the Map panel, return to 
the Display menu and choose Show 
Map again. The panel collapses, 
and you’re back to the standard 
Organizer view.
 
When you view panels in Elements, 
drag the vertical separator bar on a 
panel to widen the panel or reduce 
the panel size. Look for the arrow-
head on the vertical bar separating 
the Organizer window from a panel, 
and click and drag left or right to 
change panel sizes.
Viewing photos in a slide show (Full Screen view)
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? To take an 
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects 
and background music. Full Screen view takes you to a slide show view. For 
the purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a slide show 
as the same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools 
and menus, and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see 
your pictures.
Figure 5-6: Click a red pin to open a pop-up 
window that shows the images placed on 
the map.

104
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
Viewing files in slide show mode can be helpful for quickly previewing the files 
you want to edit for all kinds of output, as well as for previewing photos that 
you might use for an exported slide show, which we explain in Chapter 15.
Taking a quick view of the slideshow
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Organizer.
 
2. Select images that you want to see in a slide show or use all the 
images in the Organizer for your slide show.
 
 If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in 
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
 
3. Choose Display➪View Photos in Full Screen (or press F11 on your 
keyboard).
 
 In previous versions of Elements, a dialog box opened where you could 
make preference choices for full screen viewing. Now, in Elements 8, 
you jump right into the full screen view with some panels and tools 
displayed as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7: Elements 8 takes you right to full screen view after you press the F11 key.

105
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
4. View the slides.
 
 Click the arrow keys at the bottom of the screen to move forward and 
back through the slides. You can also click the Toggle Film Strip icon 
(first icon on the left at the bottom of the screen) to show a filmstrip on 
the right side of the screen. It displays your slides as shown in Figure 
5-7. Click a slide, and the main window displays the slide. 
 
5. Exit the Full Screen View. Press the Esc key on your keyboard to 
return to the Organizer window.
 
You can also open Full Screen View by clicking the Full Screen View of Photos 
icon in the Shortcuts Bar. Look for the monitor icon with a right arrow.
Getting fancy with self-running slide shows
Manually clicking arrows to view slides is more work than you need to do. 
With just a few adjustments, Elements can autoplay a slideshow complete 
with a music background. To sit back and enjoy your sides without clicking a 
mouse button to advance slides, do the following:
 
1. Select images that you want to see in a slide show in the Organizer 
window.
 
2. Press the F11 key on your keyboard to change the view to Full Screen 
mode.
 
3. Click the Open 
Settings tool on 
the toolbar at 
the bottom of the 
window, as shown 
in Figure 5-8. 
 
 The Full Screen View 
Options dialog box 
opens.
 
4. Make adjustments in 
the Full Screen View 
Options dialog box. 
 
 Click the Start 
Playing Automatically 
check box shown in 
Figure 5-9. When the 
box is selected, the 
slideshow plays auto-
matically. By default, 
you’ll also have an 
audio file play for 
the duration of the 
slideshow.
Open Settings
Figure 5-8: Click the Open Settings tool.
Select the Start Playing Automatically box
Figure 5-9: Click the Start Playing Automatically check box.

Part II: Getting Organized 
 
5. Click OK and watch the show.
 
6. Press Esc when finished viewing the slideshow.
You can make choices for the music you want played when viewing a slide-
show by clicking the Browse button and selecting an audio file from your 
hard drive. You can determine the slide interval by editing the value in the 
Page Duration text box and make choices for viewing captions and resizing 
photos before dismissing the Full Screen View Options dialog box.
Working with the panels and toolbar
Full Screen view provides you with several editing tools. When you open 
selected photos from the Organizer in Full Screen view, you’ll find two panels 
on the left side of the screen. The Quick Edit panel provides Quick Edit tools 
for editing photos, such as sharpening images and removing red-eye. The 
Quick Organize panel permits you to add keywords for easily organizing 
photos with keyword identifiers. (See Chapter 6 for more on adding keywords 
to photos.)
The toolbar shown in Figure 5-8 offers options for slide viewing. These tools 
include (from left to right):
 
✓ Toggle Filmstrip: Click this tool to show/hide the filmstrip on the right 
side of the window.
 
✓ Toggle Quick Edit panel: Shows/hides the Quick Edit panel.
 
✓ Toggle Quick Organize Panel: Shows/hides the Quick Organize panel.
 
✓ Previous Photo: Click the left arrow to open the previous photo.
 
✓ Play/Pause: Click to play or pause a slide show.
 
✓ Next Photo: Click the right arrow to advance to the next photo.
 
✓ Open Settings: Click to open the Settings dialog box. (Refer to 
Figure 5-9.)
 
✓ Transitions: Click the Transi-
tions tool, and the Select 
Transition dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 5-10. When you 
enter Full Screen view, this tool 
is selected. Four different transi-
tion effects are displayed in the 
dialog box. You can preview a 
transition effect by placing the 
cursor over one of the images. 
When you find an effect you 
like, click the image and click 
OK to change the transition.
Figure 5-10: Click the Transitions tool and the 
Select Transition dialog box opens.

107
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
✓ Toggle Properties panel: Click this tool to open the Properties dialog 
box. For more information about changing properties, see Chapter 6.
 
✓ Show all controls (right arrow): Click the tiny right-pointing arrow at 
the far right side of the toolbar, and the toolbar expands to reveal addi-
tional tools. Here you find a large display icon used for showing the Full 
Screen default view. The double monitors icon to the right is used to 
show two slides adjacent to each other in the slideshow.
 
The main thing to keep in mind is that the Full Screen view is a temporary 
viewing option you have in Elements. It’s not permanent. You use the view for 
a quick display method on your computer when you want to show off some 
photos to family and friends. You do have more permanent options for saving 
files as slideshows that can be shared with other users, as we explain in 
Chapter 15.
Using Adobe Bridge (Macintosh)
If you’re a Macintosh user, you get Adobe Bridge free with Photoshop 
Elements 8. Run the installer from the DVD-ROM, and Bridge is automatically 
installed on your computer.
You can launch Bridge by double-clicking the program icon — or directly 
from within Elements by clicking the Launch Bridge button in the Elements 
window.
When you have the Bridge open, try the following tasks:
 
✓ Navigate your Mac hard drive. Along the top left side of the Bridge 
window, you find access to hard drives and the Desktop. After copying 
photos to a folder on your hard drive, navigate your computer by clicking 
the drive and the folder where the photos are located, and you will see 
photo image thumbnails of the folder contents, as shown in Figure 5-11.
 
✓ Open files. To open files directly from within Bridge in Elements’ Edit 
Full mode, click the photos you want to open, press the Control key, and 
click to open a context menu. If you have a two-button mouse, right-click 
to open the context menu. From the menu options, choose Open With➪
Photoshop Elements 8. The selected photos open in the image window 
in Elements.
 
✓ Organize photos by sorting. Bridge has an abundant number of settings 
and options — not quite the same as the Organizer, but it is a powerful 
organization tool. In the top-right corner of the Bridge window, you can 
sort photos and choose several options for your sort criteria.

108
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ Organize photos into Collections. On the left side of the window you 
find a tab for Collections. This tab is the equivalent to the Organizer’s 
Keyword Tags feature. You can create different collections to organize 
photos in categories for a more optimized arrangement of your pictures. 
Examine the icons at the bottom of the panel and you find choices for 
creating a collection, creating a smart collection, editing a smart col-
lection, and deleting a collection. A Smart Collection provides you with 
options for dynamically sorting photos based on a variety of criteria.
Figure 5-11: Open a folder on your hard drive from within Adobe Bridge, and photo image 
thumbnails are displayed in the Bridge window.
Moving around the Image Window
When you edit images in either Edit Quick or Edit Full mode, you continu-
ally interact with the image window. Whether you’re zooming in and out of a 
single window or viewing multiple windows, you need to work comfortably 
in this area for all your editing tasks. To help you move around the image 
window, Elements provides a rich set of tools. 

109
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
If you become familiar with the many viewing options and keyboard short-
cuts available in Elements, all your editing jobs will be much easier. The 
tools, menu commands, and panels we describe in the following sections are 
essential for just about everything you do in Elements.
Zooming in and out of images
Zooming in and out of images is a task you perform routinely while editing 
images in the image window, and also when working in other windows, such 
as the Camera Raw window and the Full Screen view. Zooming in is necessary 
when you want to precisely edit a section of an image or examine detail in a 
small area. You then need to zoom out to see the edits as they compare to the 
entire image.
Zoom by clicking
The Zoom tool appears on the Tools panel. To use the tool for zooming in and 
out, follow these steps to take a look at how it all works:
 
1. Click the Zoom tool on the Tools panel to select it (or simply press Z).
 
2. Move the cursor, now loaded with the Zoom tool, to the image window 
and click the place where you want to zoom.
 
 To zoom in more, click again; keep clicking until you zoom in far enough.
 
3. To zoom out of an image, keep the Zoom tool selected, hold down the 
Alt key (Option key on the Macintosh), and click.
 
 The cursor changes to a magnifying glass tool with a minus (–) symbol 
when you hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Macintosh).
Zoom to a selection
Another way to change a view is to 
zoom to a target area in an image. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Click the Zoom tool on the 
Tools panel.
 
2. Drag a box around the area 
you want to zoom.
 
 Keep the mouse button pressed, 
and as you drag the mouse, 
a dashed rectangle marquee 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-12.
 
3. Move the rectangle marquee if 
you need to adjust the selection.
Figure 5-12: Click the Zoom tool on the Tools 
panel and drag around an area you want to 
zoom.

110
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
 Now, it’s time to get fancy. If you have a marquee drawn with the Zoom 
tool and the size appears just right, but you want to move the rectan-
gle, press the spacebar while you keep the mouse button pressed. You 
can drag the marquee rectangle anywhere in the image to zoom to the 
area defined by the rectangle boundary.
 
4. Release the mouse button.
 
 The view zooms to fit the space defined by the marquee rectangle.
Using the Options bar
Above the image window and below the Shortcuts bar, you find the Options 
bar. The Options bar is ever-changing, offering different options when you 
select different tools on the Tools panel. When you click the Zoom tool, the 
Options bar changes, as shown in Figure 5-13. You have many similar choices 
for zooming in and out of images and a few options unique to the Options bar:
Figure 5-13: Click the Zoom tool on the Tools panel to make the Options bar change to reflect 
choices for zooming in and out of images.
 
✓ Zoom In/Zoom Out tools: You can choose Zoom In or Zoom Out as sepa-
rate tools to avoid using the Alt key (Option key on the Macintosh) to 
toggle between the two.
 
✓ Zoom percentage: This figure shows you the current zoom level as a 
percentage. You can edit the text by typing values between 5 and 3200.
 
✓ Zoom slider: Click the down-pointing arrow to open a slider bar. Drag 
the slider left to zoom out or right to zoom in.
 
✓ Resize Windows to Fit: Select this check box to resize the window along 
with the image zoom. Deselect the box to zoom in and out of an image 
while the image window remains at a fixed size.
 
✓ Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple images open and select this 
check box, zooming with the Zoom tool zooms all open documents 
simultaneously.
 
✓ 1:1: Zooms the current window to a 1-to-1 ratio, showing the zoom level 
at which the file will be printed.
 
✓ Fit Screen: Click this button to fit the image within the image window.
 
✓ Full Screen: Zooms the current window to fill the screen.
 
✓ Print Size: Often, this option shows you the same size as 1:1, where the 
image is zoomed to the size of the print file.

111
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Viewing multiple documents
To work on any image in one of the editors, you need to become familiar with 
moving around the Elements interface and bring photos in view in the main 
image window.
 
Elements 8 provides you with a new modification to the user interface. While 
in Edit Full mode, you’ll notice that when several images are open, their file-
names are listed at the top of the image window, as shown in Figure 5-14. 
Figure 5-14: Multiple files opened in Edit Full mode are listed at the top 
of the image window according to filename.
The list appears similar to tabs you find in Web browsers. Notice that adja-
cent to each filename you see an X. Click the X, and the file closes. Click any 
filename, and the file opens in the image window.
Additional viewing options are available from menu commands found on 
the Window menu. Choose Window➪Images to open a submenu of viewing 
options used for viewing multiple files. The Window menu also provides a list 
of all your open documents. Here’s a list of options you find on the submenu:
 
✓ Tile: Tiling images reduces image window sizes to a size that accom-
modates viewing all images in scrollable windows within the Elements 
workspace. Choose Window➪Images➪Tile when multiple images are 
open to get a view similar to the one shown to Figure 5-15.
 
✓ Cascade: Choose Window➪Images➪Cascade to make the image win-
dows overlap each other in a cascading view.
 
✓ Float in Window: When photos are opened in the image window, they 
appear attached to the center area of your monitor. Choose this option 
to detach the photo from the image window, where you can click and 
drag the title bar around the image window area.
 
✓ Float All Windows: When you have multiple photos open, use this 
option to detach all photos from the image window. After selecting this 
option, all the photos lose the tab view shown in Figure 5-15.
 
✓ Consolidate All to Tabs: If you choose Float All Windows and want to 
return to the tab view, choose this option.

112
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ New Window: When 
you choose this 
option, you open a 
duplicate window 
for the photo in the 
foreground in the 
image window. You 
might use this option 
to create two views 
of the same image, 
where one view is 
zoomed in to edit 
some detail work 
and the other view 
shows the image in 
a reduced size for an 
overall look at the 
editing results.
 
✓ Match Zoom: Set the 
zoom level for one of 
several images open 
in Elements and 
choose Window➪
Images➪Match Zoom. 
All open documents are zoomed to the same level as the foreground 
image.
 
✓ Match Location: If you zoom in to, for example, the upper-right corner 
and then select Match Location, all open images zoom to the same loca-
tion in the respective photos.
 
You can also select and bring forward photos in the image window by double 
clicking image thumbnails in the Project Bin.
Using pan and zoom
When you zoom in on a document larger than the image window can accom-
modate, scroll bars provide a means for moving the image inside the window. 
Moving the image around a window is panning the image.
You can also use the Hand tool to pan the image. Zoom in to an image and 
click the Hand tool. Click and drag the image around the window. If you want 
to zoom in or out while the Hand tool is selected, hold down the Ctrl key (Ô 
key on the Mac), and the Hand tool temporarily changes to the Zoom In tool. 
Hold down Ctrl +Alt (Ô+Option on the Mac) to temporarily change the Hand 
tool to the Zoom Out tool.
Figure 5-15: Open several images in one of the editing modes 
and choose Window➪Images➪Tile to show all image 
windows.

113
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Using the Navigator panel
The Navigator panel affords you several different options for both zooming 
and panning an image.
To open the Navigator panel, choose 
Window➪Navigator. The Navigator 
panel, as shown in Figure 5-16, opens 
as a floating panel in the Elements 
workspace. (For more information on 
floating panels, see Chapter 1.)
While you select options for zooming 
on the Navigator panel, the image 
preview in the panel stays fixed to 
show you the entire image. When 
you zoom in and out inside the 
panel, the corresponding zoom is 
applied to the active document.
 
Either use the zoom tools on the 
panel or drag the slider left and right 
to zoom in and out. If you place the 
cursor inside the image preview 
thumbnail, you can drag a rectangle 
and zoom into the image.
 
Using the Navigator panel can be particularly helpful if you use two monitors. 
Just drag the Navigator panel to your second monitor, where you can change 
zoom levels without having the panel obscure the background image.
Sorting Your Photos (Windows)
With all the Photoshop Elements modes and workspaces, you need a consis-
tent starting place to handle all your editing tasks. Think of the Organizer as 
Grand Central Station, and from this central location, you can take the Long 
Island Railroad to any destination you desire. In Elements terms, rather than 
head out to Port Washington, you travel to an editing mode. Rather than go 
to the Hamptons, you journey through all the creation areas. In short, the 
Organizer is the central depot on the Photoshop Elements map.
In addition to being a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the Organizer is a 
management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and describe photos 
with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing files, Elements pro-
vides many different options, and we cover them all in the following sections.
Figure 5-16: The Navigator panel.

114
Part II: Getting Organized 
Using sort commands
One quick way to sort images in the Organizer is to use the menu in the 
Shortcuts bar in the Organizer window for date sorting. Two options are 
available to you, as shown in Figure 5-17.
The sorting options available to you from the 
menu are
 
✓ Date (Newest First): Select this option to 
view images according to the date you took 
the photos, beginning with the most recent 
date.
 
✓ Date (Oldest First): This option displays 
photos in chronological order, starting with 
the oldest file.
As we mention in the section “Changing the Organizer display,” earlier in 
this chapter, you can also view files according to the Import Batch date and 
Folder Locations. Under the Display menu you have options for
 
✓ Import Batch: You might import a batch of photos in one Photoshop 
Elements session and import another batch in the same session or in 
another session. When you select Import Batch, the images appear orga-
nized in groups, according to the date the batch was created.
 
✓ Folder Location: Click Folder Location to make an Explorer pane appear 
on the left side of the Organizer window. You can browse your hard drive 
for folder locations and select a folder containing images you imported 
into the Organizer.
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according to media type. Elements supports view-
ing photos, video files, audio files, projects, and Adobe PDF files. To select 
different media types, choose View➪Media Types, and a submenu offers 
options for viewing the different media types. Select a menu item from the 
submenu to make all media types matching the menu command appear in the 
Organizer window.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching photos. From the 
Find menu, you can locate photos in collections, catalogs, and the Organizer 
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
Figure 5-17: You can quickly sort 
files in ascending or descending 
order by date.

115
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
On the Macintosh you can search photos in the Adobe Bridge window. At the 
top right corner of the Bridge window, you find the Search text box. Click the 
down-pointing arrow adjacent to the magnifying glass, and you can search 
using Bridge or Apple’s Spotlight, 
To use the commands on the Find menu on Windows, you need to have 
photos loaded in the Organizer window, or create collections or catalogs, 
which we explain in Chapter 6. The categories in the following sections can 
be searched in the Organizer.
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window from 
photos shot on different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos, 
and all other types of files supported by Elements, through a date search.
On the Macintosh, use the Sort drop-down menu just below the magnifying 
glass and choose By Date from the menu options in Adobe Bridge.
In the Organizer, the date is taken from the camera metadata; but if a date 
isn’t available from the camera data, the date is taken from the file creation 
date. The creation date is not likely to be the date you shot the photo.
To search files by date in the Organizer on Windows, follow these steps:
 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then 
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
 
 To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and 
Folders submenu command.
 
2. Select a date range by choosing Find➪Set Date Range.
 
 The Set Date Range dialog box, shown in Figure 5-18, opens.
 
3. Specify the dates.
 
 Type a year in the Start Date Year text box. Select the month and day 
from the Month and Day drop-
down lists. Repeat the same 
selections for the end date.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The thumbnails shown in the 
Organizer window include only 
files created within the specified 
date range.
Figure 5-18: Open the Set Date Range dialog 
box and specify the start and end dates.

116
Part II: Getting Organized 
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain in Chapter 6. 
When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels. We 
cover sorting by tag labels in Chapter 6, too. For now, take a look at the Find 
menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you haven’t added tags to 
some items and want to show only the untagged files so that you can begin to 
add tags, choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl+Shift+Q. Elements dis-
plays all files without tags in the Organizer window.
Searching collections
Collections are among many items we address in Chapter 6. You can create 
collections and then select a collection on the Collections panel. Selecting 
a collection is like having a first level of sorting. You can then search by date 
or other sort options discussed in the preceding and following sections to 
narrow the choices.
Searching captions and notes
In Chapter 6, we talk about adding captions and notes to your files. When 
captions or notes are added to files, you can search for the caption name, 
contents of a note, or both. To search caption names and notes, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then 
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
 
 If you’re opening files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files 
and Folders submenu command.
 
2. Choose Find➪By Caption or Note.
 
 The Find by Caption or Note dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
 Options in the dialog box are
 
• Find Items with Caption or 
Note: In the text box, type 
the words you want to 
locate.
 
• Match Only the Beginning 
of Words in Captions and 
Notes: Click this radio 
button when you know 
that your caption or note 
begins with words you 
type in the text box.
Figure 5-19: Choose Find➪By Caption or Note 
to open the dialog box in which search criteria 
for captions and notes are specified.

117
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
• Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes: Click this radio 
button if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used 
at the beginning of a caption or note, or whether it’s contained 
within the caption name or note text.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do with your photos, such as printing, 
e-mailing, sharing, and performing a number of other tasks. You can search 
for files based on the file history by choosing Find➪By History. Selecting 
options on the By History submenu reports files found on date searches 
meeting the history criteria.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes information about your images that’s supplied by digital 
cameras as well as custom data you add to a file. Metadata contains descrip-
tions of the image, such as your camera name, the camera settings you used 
to take a picture, copyright information, and much more.
Searching metadata is easy. Just choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the 
Organizer. The Find by 
Details (Metadata) dialog 
box opens. The first two 
columns in the dialog 
box offer a number of dif-
ferent choices for search 
criteria and options 
according to the criteria. 
In the third column, you 
specify exactly what you 
want to search by typing 
search criteria in the text 
box. Clicking the plus 
button adds new lines 
to add more criteria to 
the search, as shown in 
Figure 5-20, and clicking 
the minus button deletes 
a line.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Searching faces
If a magical method is available to you for searching files in Elements, it has 
to be searching for faces. When you choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging, 
Elements searches through files you select in the Organizer window and 
examines each image for a face — Homo sapiens faces, to be exact.
 
Note that you should first select image thumbnails in the Organizer window 
and then choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging. If you don’t select files, 
Elements searches the entire catalog. Be aware that if you search through a 
large catalog, Elements takes some time to complete the search.
The results of the search magically include all photos containing faces in a 
new Organizer window. Although the command is intended to identify images 
you can tag, you can use the command for invoking a search and choosing to 
view all files containing faces.

D
ownloading a bunch of media cards filled with photos and 
leaving them in folders distributed all over your hard 
drive is like having a messy office with papers stacked all 
over your desk. Trying to find a file, even with all the 
great search capabilities we cover in Chapter 5, can 
take you as much time as sorting through piles of 
papers. What you need is a good file-management 
system.
In this chapter, we talk about organizing and anno-
tating files, and the important task of backing up 
files. Be certain to take a little time to understand 
the organizational methods that Elements offers, 
keep your files organized when you copy them to your 
hard drive, and back up files to CDs or DVDs. The time 
you invest in organizing your pictures helps you quickly 
locate files when you need them.
 
The Organizer is a Windows only tool. On the Macintosh, Adobe Bridge is 
used to manage your photos.

120
Part II: Getting Organized 
Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files, in the 
form of keyword tags. After you acquire your images in the Organizer, as we 
discuss in Chapter 4, sort them out and add keyword tags according to the 
dates you took the pictures, the subject matter, or some other categorical 
arrangement.
In the Organizer window, the Keywords Tags panel helps you sort your 
pictures and keep them well organized. You use the Keyword Tags panel 
(which we talk about in the section “Working with keyword tags,” later in 
this chapter) to identify individual images by using a limitless number of 
options for categorizing your pictures. On the Keyword Tags panel, you can 
create keyword tags and collection groups to neatly organize files.
In the following sections, you can find out how to create and manage 
keyword tags.
Creating and viewing a new keyword tag
To create a new keyword tag and add photos to the tag, follow these steps:
 
1. Open photos in the Organizer.
 
 Open the Organizer window by clicking the Organizer button in an 
editing mode or by selecting Organize on the Welcome screen. Choose 
File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders. Note that you 
should have copied some photos to your hard drive, as we explain in 
Chapter 4.
 
2. To create a new keyword tag, click the plus sign (+) icon in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a drop-down menu and then choose 
New Keyword Tag. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+N to create a new 
Keyword Tag.
 
 The Create Keyword Tag dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
3. Specify a category. 
 
 Click the Category drop-down menu and choose one of the preset 
categories listed in the menu. (See the next section for instructions on 
customizing these categories.)
 
4. Type a name for the tag in the Name text box and add a note to 
describe the keyword tag.
 
 You might use the location where you took the photos, the subject 
matter, or other descriptive information for the note.

121
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
5. (Optional) If you want to assign 
the keyword tag to a map loca-
tion on the Yahoo! Maps, as we 
discuss in Chapter 5, click the 
Place on Map button. If you 
want to add a Note, type in the 
Note text box.
 
 When you click Place on Map, a 
dialog box opens in which you 
type a city name for placing the 
image on Yahoo! Maps. Type a 
city name and select the correct 
city from options provided in a 
second dialog box.
 
 Notes offer an opportunity to 
add descriptions for your tags.
 
6. Click OK in the Edit Keyword 
Tag dialog box.
 
 You return to the Organizer 
window.
 
7. In the Organizer window, select the photos you want to keyword tag.
 
 Click a photo and Shift-click another photo to select photos in a group. 
Click a photo and Ctrl-click different photos scattered around the 
Organizer window to select nonsequential photos.
 
8. To add a new keyword tag to a photo (or selection of photos), click 
one of the selected photos in the Organizer window and drag the 
photo thumbnail to the New Tag icon on the Keyword Tags panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can drag a tag to the selected photos.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the photos are added to the new 
keyword tag.
 
9. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create keyword tags for all the images you 
want to organize.
To view one or more keyword tags, click the empty square adjacent to a key-
word tag icon to show the photos within that group in the Organizer window. 
When you click the empty square, an icon in the shape of a pair of binoculars 
appears inside the square, as shown in Figure 6-2. All photos matching the 
keyword tags are shown in the Organizer window.
Figure 6-1: The Create Keyword Tag dialog box.

122
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
To return to viewing all photos in the 
Organizer, click the binoculars in the 
Tags panel. The square returns to 
empty and turns off viewing the 
tagged files.
Working with keyword 
tags
You can manage keyword tags by 
using menu commands from the New 
drop-down menu and other com-
mands from a context menu that you 
open by right-clicking a keyword tag 
on the Keyword Tags panel.
In the New drop-down menu, you can access these commands:
 
✓ New Keyword Tag: Create a new keyword tag, as we describe in the 
steps in the preceding section.
 
✓ New Sub-Category: A sub-category is like a nested bookmark. Create a 
sub-category by selecting New Sub-Category from the New menu; a dialog 
box opens, prompting you to type a name for the new sub-category. As 
an example of how you might use keyword tags and sub-categories, you 
might have a keyword tag named Uncle Joe’s Wedding. Then, you might 
create sub-categories for Bride Dressing Room, Ceremony, Family Photos, 
Reception, and so on.
 
✓ New Category: Choose New Category from the New menu in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a dialog box that prompts you to type a 
name for the new category. By default, you’ll find predefined category 
names for People, Places, Events, and Other. If you want to add your 
own custom category, use this menu command.
 
✓ From File: If you export a keyword tag, the file is written as XML (eXten-
sible Markup Language). When you choose From File, you can import an 
XML file of a keyword tags file.
 
✓ Save Keyword Tags to a File: You can save keyword tags to a file that 
can be retrieved with the From File command. This option is handy 
when you open a different catalog file and want to import the same 
collection names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See 
the section “Cataloging Files,” later in this chapter.)
Figure 6-2: A binocular icon appears when you 
click an empty square.

123
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
✓ Collapse All Keyword Tags: Keyword tags appear like bookmark lists 
that can be collapsed and expanded. An expanded list shows you all the 
sub-category keyword tags. Choose Collapse All Keyword Tags to col-
lapse the list.
 
✓ Expand All Keyword Tags: This command expands a collapsed list.
 
When you create a new keyword tag, you see a large icon in the Keyword 
Tags panel. The default tags appear with small icons. You can access the 
items that appear below default tags by clicking the right-pointing arrow to 
expand the list.
Right-click a collection name to make the following menu commands appear:
 
✓ Change <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to a Sub-Category: 
Choose this menu command to change a keyword tag to a keyword 
tag sub-category.
 
✓ Edit <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This menu command opens 
the Edit Keyword Tag dialog box. You can rename a keyword tag, change 
the note, or change the map location in this dialog box. Alternatively, 
you can click the Pencil tool on the Keyword Tags panel to open the 
same dialog box.
 
✓ Delete <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: Select a keyword tag and 
select this menu option to delete a keyword tag. Alternatively, click the 
Trash icon on the panel to delete a keyword tag. Note that deleting a 
keyword tag doesn’t delete files.
 
✓ Place on Map: Choose Place on Map to add images to a Yahoo! Map 
location, as we describe in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Remove from Map: Choose this command to remove tags from Yahoo! 
Maps.
 
✓ Show on Map: This command opens the Yahoo! Maps panel and shows 
the red pin at the map location with which the image(s) are associated.
 
✓ New Search Using <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This command 
searches through a catalog and displays all the photos assigned the key-
word tag in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Add Media with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to Search Results: 
If you select one photo in the Organizer, the number is one. Selecting 
more than one photo changes the number to the total number of 
selected images. When you open a context menu, the selected images 
are added to the keyword tag where the context menu is opened.

124
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ Exclude Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag from Search 
Results: Select photos in the Organizer window and choose this com-
mand to exclude the selected photos from the search.
 
✓ Attach <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to <n> Selected Items: 
Select a file in the Organizer window and choose this command to attach 
the keyword tag to the file.
 
Keyword tags are saved automatically with the catalog you work with. By 
default, Elements creates a catalog and auto-saves your work to it. If you 
happen to create another catalog, as we explain in the next section, your 
keyword tags disappear. Be aware of which catalog is open when you create 
keyword tags in order to return to them.
Getting your head in the clouds
 
Elements 8 introduces another way to view and search for photos in a cata-
log. The Tags Cloud feature is accessed by clicking the View Tags Cloud icon 
in the Tags panel, as shown in Figure 6-3. When you click the icon, an alpha-
betical list of your tags appears in the panel.
Figure 6-3: Click the Tags Cloud icon to display a hierarchical list of the 
tags categories.

125
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Click a tag name in the list to select a tag and view all photos tagged with 
the respective name. When you look over the tag cloud, you find names in 
large, medium, and small text. This order displays the hierarchy of the tags. 
The large text is the parent name, the medium text is a category within the 
parent, and the small text is the tag item below a category.
 
To return to the default tags view, click the View Tag Hierarchy icon to the left 
of the View Tags Cloud icon on the Keyword Tags panel.
Cataloging Files
When you open files in the Organizer, all your files are saved automatically to 
a catalog. The files themselves aren’t really saved to the catalog, rather links 
from the catalog to the individual files are saved. Links are like pointers that 
tell the catalog where to look for a file. When you add and delete files within 
the Organizer, the catalog is continually updated.
 
When you open more files in the Organizer, the default catalog file grows, and 
the maximum size of the catalog file is limited only by your available hard 
drive space. Working with a single catalog file has some disadvantages. For 
example, if your catalog file becomes corrupted and unrecoverable, you lose 
all the work you’ve done organizing files into keyword tags. If you work with 
many files, the Organizer performance slows down.
Rather than work with a single catalog file, you can fine-tune your file organi-
zation by creating several catalogs. You might want to organize files accord-
ing to subject matter, dates, locations, or some other division of categories, 
and then create separate catalogs for each category. You can find all the 
details in the sections that follow.
Importing photos to a new catalog
To keep your photos organized and your catalog files small, you can start a 
completely new catalog before you import photos. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Catalog and click the New button in the Catalog Manager 
dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
2. When the New Catalog dialog box opens, type a name for the new 
catalog in the File Name text box and then click Save.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to add free music files installed with Elements, 
select the Import Free Music into All New Catalogs check box.

126
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
4. Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos to add files to the new catalog.
 
 When the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, a list of 
media files appears 
in the dialog box 
when the Import 
Free Music into All 
New Catalogs check 
box is selected.
 
5. (Optional) Select 
the free music 
files to add to your 
collection; then 
navigate your hard 
drive and select the 
photos you want 
to add. After you 
identify all the files, 
click Open.
 
 The selected music 
files and photos are 
added to your new 
collection.
Splitting a big catalog into smaller catalogs
Unfortunately, Elements doesn’t provide you a command to split large cata-
logs into smaller ones. It’s best to understand first how you want to organize 
your photos before creating your first catalog. However, if you’ve created 
a large catalog and want to split it into two or more separate catalogs, you 
need to manually add new photos to a new catalog and delete photos from 
the older catalog.
Switching to a different catalog
When you need to open a different catalog file, choose File➪Catalog and 
select the name of the catalog you want to open. Click Open at the bottom of 
the dialog box to open the selected catalog. The Organizer window changes 
to reflect files contained in that catalog.
Notice the Repair and Optimize buttons in Figure 6-4. If you can’t see thumb-
nail previews of images or open them in one of the editing modes, your cata-
log file might be corrupted. Click the Repair button to try to fix the problem. 
Figure 6-4: Choose File➪Catalog to open the Catalog 
Manager dialog box.

127
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
When catalogs get sluggish, you might need to optimize a catalog to gain 
better performance. Click Optimize in the Catalog Manager routinely to keep 
your catalog operating at optimum performance.
Backing up your catalog
Computer users often learn the hard way about the importance of backing up 
a hard drive and the precious data they spent time creating and editing. We 
can save you some aggravation right now, before you spend any more time 
editing your photos in Elements.
We authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our 
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs when we finish them. The stan-
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets 
to the point where redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s time 
to back up files.
When organizing your files, adding keyword tags and creating albums, and 
creating stacks and version sets, you want to back up the catalog file in case 
your catalog becomes corrupted.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your data log:
 
1. Choose File➪Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive to open the 
Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive Wizard.
 
 This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through to pain-
lessly create a backup of your files.
 
2. Select the source to back up.
 
 The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
 
• Full Backup: Click this radio button to perform your first backup or 
write files to a new media source.
 
• Incremental Backup: Use this option if you’ve already performed at 
least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
 
3. Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.
 
 Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer, 
appear in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 6-5. Select 
a drive, and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and identi-
fies a previous backup file if one was created. The total size of the files 
to copy is reported in the wizard. This information is helpful so that 
you know whether more than one CD or DVD is needed to complete the 
backup.

128
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
4. If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard drive 
attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify the 
path.
 
 If you use a media 
source, such as a CD 
or DVD, Elements 
prompts you to 
insert a disc and 
readies the media 
for writing.
 
5. Click Done, and the 
backup commences.
 
 Be certain to not 
interrupt the backup. 
It might take some 
time, so just let 
Elements work away 
until you’re notified 
that the backup is 
complete.
Backing up photos and files
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second 
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately, 
Elements makes finding files to back up a breeze.
Choose File➪Make a CD/DVD and then in the dialog box that opens, click Yes 
to confirm the action. The Make a CD/DVD dialog box opens. Select a hard 
drive or a CD/DVD drive, type a name for the backup folder, and click OK. 
Elements goes about copying all files shown in the Organizer window to your 
backup source.
Creating Albums
With keyword tags, you can organize files into categories and sub-categories, 
which help keep your files neatly organized within a catalog. Elements offers 
additional organizing control in the Albums panel. You might want to orga-
nize an album for sharing photos with others on Photoshop.com, assemble 
Figure 6-5: The wizard provides options for selecting the 
destination media for the backup.

129
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
an album and rate each photo with a range from one to five stars, create a 
slide show, or just use the Albums panel to further segregate images within 
different categories.
Think of a catalog as a parent item, and think of keyword tags albums as 
its children. Within keyword tags, you can use the sort options (discussed 
in Chapter 5) to sort files according to date. If you still have a number of 
files in an Organizer window that are hard to manage, you can create tags 
that form sub-categories within the keyword tags. Additionally, you can 
create an album out of a number of photos within a given keyword tag. For 
example, you might have a huge number of photos taken on a European 
vacation. Your catalog contains all the images taken on that trip. You can 
then create keyword tags for files according to the country visited. You then 
might rate the photos according to the best pictures you took on your trip. 
The highest-rated images could then be assembled in an album and viewed 
as a slide show.
Rating images
You can rate photos in the Organizer by tagging images with one to five stars. 
You might have some photos that are exceptional, which you want to give 
five-star ratings, whereas poor photos with lighting and focus problems might 
be rated with one star.
Rating photos is handled in the Properties panel. To assign a star rating to a 
file, open a context menu by right-clicking a photo and selecting Properties 
from that menu. The Properties – 
General panel, shown in Figure 6-6, 
opens. Click a star to rate the photo. 
Alternatively, you can click a photo, 
choose Edit➪Ratings, and choose a 
star rating from the submenu that 
appears.
When you select the Details check 
box on the Shortcuts bar, all your 
rated photos appear with the 
number of stars according to the 
rating you provided, as shown in 
Figure 6-7. You can easily sort files 
according to ratings by choosing the 
Edit➪Ratings command and select a 
star rating from the submenu.
Figure 6-6: Rating photos with stars in the 
Properties panel.

130
Part II: Getting Organized 
Adding rated files to an album
You might want to rate 
images with star ratings 
and then add all your 
images to an album. 
Within the album, you 
can still choose to view 
your pictures according 
to star ratings.
Creating an album
In the section “Organizing 
Groups of Images with 
Keyword Tags,” earlier in 
this chapter, we discuss 
how creating keyword 
tags and assigning tags to 
photos help you organize 
a collection of photos and how sub-categories help you break down a collec-
tion into additional categories. With albums and star ratings, you can further 
break down a collection into groups that you might want to mark for printing, 
sharing, or onscreen slide shows.
To create an album, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the plus sign (+) icon on the Albums panel and choose New 
Album from the drop-down menu shown in Figure 6-8.
 
 The Albums panel expands to 
show the Album Details.
 
2. Name the new album.
 
 Type a name for the album in 
the Album Name text box, as 
shown in Figure 6-9.
 
3. Drag photos from the 
Organizer to the items window 
in the Album Content panel, 
shown in Figure 6-9.
 
 Alternatively, you can select 
photos in the Organizer and 
click the plus sign (+) icon to 
add them to the album.
 
4. Click Done at the bottom of 
the panel.
 
 Your new album now appears listed in the Albums panel.
Figure 6-7: When the Details check box is selected, all rated 
photos appear with stars.
Figure 6-8: Click the plus sign (+) icon to open 
the drop-down menu and then choose New 
Album.

131
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
That’s it! Your new album is created, and the 
photos you drag to the album are added to it. You 
can isolate all the photos within a given album by 
clicking the album name in the Albums panel.
 
Creating multiple albums uses only a fraction of 
the memory that would be required if you wanted 
to duplicate photos for multiple purposes, such 
as printing, Web hosting, sharing, and so on.
Creating a Smart Album
You can perform a search based on a number 
of different criteria, as we explain in Chapter 5. 
The Smart Album feature enables you to save 
the search results in an album. After you have 
all the files shown in the Organizer based on the 
searches you perform, you can create a Smart 
Album as follows:
 
1. Open the New menu on the Albums panel 
and choose New Smart Album.
 
 The New Smart Album dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 6-10. 
 
2. Type a name for your new Smart Album. 
 
3. Make selections for the search criteria 
below the Name text box. 
 
 You can search using 
multiple criteria by 
clicking the Plus (+) 
icon in the New 
Smart Album dialog 
box. Click the icon, 
and a new line 
appears. Choose 
options from the 
Filename drop-down 
menu, the Contains 
drop-down menu, 
and the last drop-
down menu to help 
narrow your search.
 
4. Click OK.
  
 The Smart Album is listed above the albums in the Albums panel.
Figure 6-9: Drag photos to 
the Items area in the Album 
Contents panel.
Figure 6-10: Type a name for your new Smart Album, add the 
search criteria, and click OK to add the album to the Albums 
panel.

132
Part II: Getting Organized 
Creating an Album Category
The Albums panel contains all the albums and Smart Albums you create in an 
organized list. By default, the albums are listed in alphabetical order. If you 
add many albums to the panel, the list can be long, making it difficult to find 
the album you want to use for a given editing session.
 
If you’re a user of Photoshop Elements prior to version 8, New Album 
Category was previously referred to as a New Album Group.
An Album Category is no more than a divider shown in the Albums panel. 
You don’t add photos to the group. You nest albums within a group in a 
hierarchical manner. To understand how to create an Album Category, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Create several albums.
 
 To begin, you should have two or more albums added to the Albums 
panel. For example, suppose that you have many photos of a vacation 
trip to Hawaii. You want to divide the photos by images taken at a luau, a 
diving trip, a day on Waikiki Beach, or other similar events that you want 
to group together. For each category, such as Luau, Diving, or Waikiki, 
you create a separate album.
 
2. Create an Album Category by clicking the New menu on the Albums 
panel and choosing New Album Category.
 
 The Create Album Category dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-11, opens.
 
3. Type a name for the group in the Album 
Category Name text box.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 You new Album Category is added to the 
Albums panel.
 
5. Click and drag an album onto the Album 
Category name in the Albums panel.
 
 The albums you drag to the Album Category 
are nested within the group, as shown in 
Figure 6-12.
Figure 6-12 shows an expanded Album Category, as denoted by the list 
(below Wedding Photos) and the disclosure triangle. To collapse a group, 
click the down-pointing arrow. The group names remain visible and provide 
you with more viewing space on the Albums panel, making it easier to scroll 
long lists.
Figure 6-11: Type a name for 
your new Album Category in 
the Create Album Category 
dialog box.

133
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
Like keyword tags, albums can 
be saved to an XML (eXtensible 
Markup Language) file, and the files 
can be loaded in the Albums panel. 
Open the New menu, where you find 
commands for Save Albums to File 
and From File. You can export an 
album to a file and then copy the 
file to another computer, making it 
easy to organize photos on several 
computers.
Hiding Files That Get 
in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so that you can keep your images 
organized and easy to find.
With a simple menu command, you can mark selected files in the Organizer 
as hidden. You might have several files of the same subject and want to keep 
only one file visible in the Organizer window. However, you may not want to 
delete the other photos. As such, you can hide files in the Organizer window 
and show the hidden files by using menu commands.
Select files you want to hide, and from either the Edit menu or a context 
menu, choose Visibility➪Mark as Hidden. To see the files you mark for hiding, 
return to the same Visibility menu and choose Show Hidden. Essentially, 
you remove the check mark for Show Hidden, resulting in hiding the files. 
To easily toggle between showing and hiding files marked for hiding, choose 
View➪Hidden Files. Selecting this menu command toggles between showing 
and hiding the files you marked for hiding.
Stacking ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards that is face up. You see only the front 
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the 
same way. You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any time, 
you can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the Organizer 
window.
To create a stack, follow these steps:
Figure 6-12: Albums are nested below an 
Album Category.

134
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
1. In the Organizer, select several photos.
 
 You can select any number of photos. However, you can’t stack audio or 
movie files.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
 
 Elements stacks your photos. The first image 
you select remains in view in the Organizer 
window. In the upper-right area, an icon that 
looks like a stack of cards appears on the 
image thumbnail when you’ve stacked some 
images. Double-click the photo to open the 
stack in the Organizer, and you find the same 
icon in the top-right corner, as shown in 
Figure 6-13. 
After you stack a group of images, you can use 
the Stack submenu commands to manage the 
photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose 
Edit➪Stack. The submenu commands that are 
available include
 
✓ Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Select this command to make 
Elements search the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar 
appearances. Photos that have visually similar appearances are opened 
in a separate window, where you can select photos you want to stack. 
Make a selection of two or more photos, and select Stack Selected 
Photos.
 
✓ Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you 
have several photos selected to create a stack.
 
✓ Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this com-
mand to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the 
stack.
 
✓ Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all

✓ Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show only 
the top photo in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes 
available.
 
 Be careful with this command. When you flatten a stack, all photos 
except for the top photo are deleted from the catalog (not from your 
hard disk).
 
✓ Remove Photo from Stack: Choosing this command removes the 
selected photos from the stack.

✓ Set as Top Photo: You also need to first choose Expand Photos in Stack 
before accessing this command. If you don’t like the topmost photo, 
select another and choose this menu command to move the selected 
photo to the top of the stack.
 
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form, 
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command doesn’t require you to 
individually select stacks in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file. You 
can edit an image and save both the edited version and the original as a ver-
sion set. Additional edits can be made in either editing mode and saved to a 
version set. To create a version set, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.
 
2. Apply an edit.
 
 For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness 
problems in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast 
and brightness. See Chapter 10 for more details on adjusting contrast 
and brightness.
 
3. View the items in the version set by clicking the image in the Organizer 
and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Expand Items in Version Set.
 
 Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply 
the Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and shows 
two thumbnail images — one representing the original image and the 
other representing the edited version.
 
4. To open the original in Edit Full mode, select the original image 
and then select Edit Full from the Display drop-down menu on the 
Organizer menu bar.
 
5. Edit the image in Edit Full mode.
 
 You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image. 
For example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing 
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 
6. Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
 
7. In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the Include 
in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with Original check boxes.
 
8. Click Save.
 
 The edit made in Edit Full mode is saved as another version in your 
version set.

136
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu 
and choose menu commands that are similar to commands available with 
stacks. (See the preceding section for details.)
After you create a version 
set, you find additional 
submenu commands 
you can use to manage 
the version set. Choose 
Edit➪Version Set, or open 
a context menu on a ver-
sion set and then choose 
Version Set. The submenu, 
as shown in Figure 6-14, 
opens.
Items listed in the Version Set submenu include
 
✓ Expand Items in Version Set: Click a version set and choose this menu 
command to expand the items in the version set.
 
✓ Collapse Items in Version Set: When items are expanded, you can return 
them to a collapsed view by selecting this command.
 
✓ Flatten Version Set: Be careful here. If you choose this command, you 
lose all items in the version set except the top image.
 
✓ Convert Version Set to Individual Items: This command removes items 
from the version set and adds each version as a separate image to the 
Organizer window.
 
✓ Revert to Original: This command deletes the version set and returns 
you to the original, unedited version of the file.
 
✓ Remove Item(s) from Version Set: As stated, this option removes an 
item from a version set.
 
✓ Set as Top Item: When viewing an expanded version set, click one of the 
images and choose this item to move it to the top.
Sticking Digital Notes on Your Photos
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities, which we discuss 
in the section “Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags” earlier in this 
chapter, is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption or note, you can 
search captions or notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or Note menu com-
mand. Captions and notes are also helpful when you create different keyword 
tags — such as slide presentations and photo albums — by using the Create 
panel, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Figure 6-14: Use the Edit menu or a context menu opened 
on a version set, and then choose Version Set to open the 
submenu.

137
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Text captions are easy to create. Although you can select a thumbnail image 
in the Organizer window and choose Edit➪Add Caption, a better way is to 
use the Properties panel. Just follow these steps:
 
1. To open the Properties panel, select a thumbnail image in the 
Organizer, right-click it, and 
choose Show Properties from 
the context menu that appears.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose 
Window➪Properties or press 
Alt+Enter. In either case, the 
Properties – General panel 
opens, as shown in Figure 6-15.
 
2. Type a caption by adding text 
to the Caption text box.
 
3. Type text in the Notes area on 
the panel to add a note.
 
 That’s all there is to it. You can 
also record audio notes about 
an image.
Automating Your Organization
If you have a number of common edits you want to make on a collection of 
photos, Elements lets you perform common changes to multiple files. With 
a single menu command, you can change file formats, change file attributes, 
and add common file base names. File renaming can be part of the Export 
command, or you can use a menu option for renaming files in the Organizer.
Automating common tasks when you export
You might use the Export Selected Items dialog box frequently when you’re 
acquiring images from digital cameras. What you may not know is that this 
dialog box can automate other common tasks, too.
 
✓ Add common base names for the filenames. (For example, change 
names, such as DSC000001, DSC000002, and so on, to more descriptive 
filenames, such as Dallas 001 and Dallas 002.)
 
✓ Change the file format.
 
✓ Change the file size and quality.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Follow these steps to use options in the Export dialog box:
 
1. Select files and open the Export New Items dialog box by choosing 
File➪Export➪As New File(s) or pressing Ctrl+E.
 
 The Export New Files 
dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 6-16.
 
 You don’t have to 
select files before-
hand. You can iden-
tify files in another 
dialog box that’s 
accessible from 
within the Export 
New Files dialog 
box. If you know 
ahead of time which 
files you want to 
export, go ahead and 
select them in the 
Organizer window.
 
2. Select a file type.
 
 From the File Type 
options, select the 
format you want to 
use for the exported 
images. For more 
information on file 
formats, see Chapter 3.
 
3. Select a size and quality.
 
 If you select Use Original Format in Step 2, resizing options are grayed 
out. You use this setting when you want to retain the original sizes while 
you rename files. If you select JPEG, you can move the quality slider, as 
we explain in Chapter 3, to set the image quality of JPEG images. None of 
the other format options provides a quality option.
 
 For sizing images, select commands from the Photo Size drop-down 
list, where you find several fixed dimensions and an option for using a 
custom size.
 
4. Select a target location for the new files by clicking the Browse button 
and selecting a folder.
Figure 6-16: The Export New Files dialog box permits you to 
rename and change formats for batches of files.

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
 If you want to create a new folder, you can click the Make New Folder 
button in the Browse for Folder dialog box, which opens after you click 
the Browse button.
 
5. If you want to keep the original filenames, click the Original Names 
radio button. If you want to rename files with a common base name, 
select Common Base Name and type a name in the text box.
 
 The resultant files 
are <base name>001.

6. If you want to add 
files to the list for 
exporting, click the 
plus sign (+) symbol 
in the lower-left 
corner.
 
 This step opens the 
Add Media dialog 
box, as shown in 
Figure 6-17, which 
offers a number of 
different options 
for selecting files to 
export.
 
 Among your choices in this dialog box are
 
• Media Currently in Browser: Click this radio button when you want 
to export all files shown in the Organizer window.
 
• Entire Catalog: Click this radio button if you’re viewing a catalog, 
tagged files, or a sorted group in which some files are temporarily 
hidden. When you select this option, all hidden files are included in 
the export.
 
• Album: Click the Album radio button and select an album from the 
drop-down list. 
 
 You can search albums and save the results as a Smart Album. To 
create a Smart Album, just perform any kind of search and then 
click New Smart Album below the plus sign (+) icon in the Albums 
panel.
Figure 6-17: The Add Media dialog box offers a number of 
options for exporting photos.

140
Part II: Getting Organized 
 
• Keyword Tag: Click this radio button to select files marked with 
keyword tags. All files with the same tag are exported.
 
• Only Show Media with Ratings: All photos and other supported 
media with star ratings are shown on the window.
 
• Also Show Hidden Media: Any file that might be hidden in the 
Organizer can be made visible in the file list and included in the 
export.
 
• Select All: When you add files to the list window, you can choose 
to export all files from the selected category. Click the Select All 
button to mark all the files for export.
 
• Deselect All: If you want some files from the list window exported 
while others remain behind, click the Deselect All button and then 
individually click the check boxes for all files you want to export.
 
• Add Selected Media: When you add photos and other media by 
using the options found in the Add Photos From area in the dialog 
box, the thumbnails for the images appear in a scrollable window 
inside the dialog box. You can select individual photos to be 
included in the export by checking the boxes adjacent to each 
photo. After checking the photos you want to include, click this 
button. The button action doesn’t dismiss the dialog box; it merely 
marks the files for inclusion.
 
• Done: Click this button to return to the Export Selected Items 
dialog box.
 
• Cancel: Click to cancel out of the dialog box.
 
7. Select any images you don’t want included in the export by clicking 
the check box to remove a check mark.
 
8. Click Export.
 
 Click Done in the Add Photos dialog box and then click Done in the 
Export Selected dialog box. Elements automatically exports the images 
to the selected folder.
Renaming files
If you load an Organizer window and want to rename files, you don’t need 
to use the Export command and wade through the options in the Export 
Selected Files dialog box. Just select the files you want to rename and then 
choose File➪Rename. In the Rename dialog box that opens, type a base name 
for the files and click OK. The selected files are renamed using a common 
base name. You’ll find this a quick and easy way to rename those digital 
camera images.

Part III
Selecting and 
Correcting Photos

In this part . . .
T
he wide array of editing features in Elements 
permit you to change, optimize, perfect, and 
combine images into composite designs. In this 
part, you discover how to select image content 
and then alter that content for a variety of pur-
poses, such as correcting the color, changing the 
appearance, and extracting the content so that 
you can introduce it in other photos. Because 
photos are composed of many thousands of tiny 
pixels, you need to develop some skill in selecting 
just the pixels you want to use for any given edit-
ing task.
In addition to describing how to create image 
selections, this part covers photo correction for 
image contrast and brightness, color correction, 
and color conversions from one color mode to 
another. Rarely do you encounter digital images 
that don’t require some kind of correction. In the 
chapters ahead, you can fi nd out how to quickly 
master some powerful correction techniques.

f all you want to do is use your photos in all their unedited glory, feel free 
to skip this chapter and move on to other topics. But if you want to occa-
sionally pluck an element out of its environment and stick it in another, or 
apply an adjustment to just a portion of your image, this chapter’s 
for you.
Finding out how to make accurate selections is one of 
those skills that’s well worth the time you invest. In 
this chapter, we cover all the various selection tools 
and techniques. We give you tips on which tools are 
better for which kinds of selections. But remember 
that you usually have several ways to achieve the 
same result. Which road you choose is ultimately 
up to you.
Defining Selections
Before you dig in and get serious about selecting, let us 
clarify for the record what we mean by defining a selection. 
When you define a selection, you specify which part of an image 
you want to work with. Everything within a selection is considered selected. 

144
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Everything outside the selection is unselected. After you have a selection, 
you can then adjust only that portion, and the unselected portion remains 
unchanged. Or you can copy the selected area into another image altogether. 
Want to transport yourself out of your background and onto a white sandy 
beach? Select yourself out of that backyard BBQ photo, get a stock photo of 
the tropical paradise of your choice, and drag and drop yourself onto your 
tropics photo with the Move tool. It’s that easy.
When you make a selection, a dotted outline — variously called a selec-
tion border, an outline, or a marquee — appears around the selected area. 
Elements, the sophisticated imaging program that it is, also allows you to 
partially select pixels, which allows for soft-edged selections. You create 
soft-edged selections by feathering or anti-aliasing the selection or by using a 
mask. Don’t worry: We cover these techniques in the section, “Applying mar-
quee options,” later in this chapter.
 
For all the selection techniques described in this chapter, be sure that your 
image is in Edit Full mode in the Editor and not in Edit Quick or Edit Guided 
modes or if you are using Windows, in the Organizer.
Creating Rectangular and Elliptical Selections
If you can drag a mouse, you can master the Rectangular and Elliptical 
Marquee tools. These two tools are the easiest selection tools to use, so if 
your desired element is rectangular or elliptical, by all means, grab one of 
these tools.
The Rectangular Marquee tool, as its moniker states, is designed to define 
rectangular or square selections. This tool is great to use if you want to 
home in on the pertinent portion of your photo and eliminate unnecessary 
background.
Here’s how to make a selection with this tool:
 
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a dotted square. You can also press M to access the tool. If it 
isn’t visible, press Shift+M.
 
2. Drag from one corner of the area you want to select to the opposite 
corner.
 
 While you drag, the selection border appears. The marquee follows the 
movement of your mouse cursor.

145
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
3. Release your mouse button.
 
 You now have a completed rect-
angular selection, as shown in 
Figure 7-1.
The Elliptical Marquee tool, which 
shares the same flyout menu as 
the Rectangular Marquee tool, is 
designed for elliptical or circular 
selections. This tool is perfect for 
selecting balloons, clocks, and other 
rotund elements.
Here’s how to use the Elliptical 
Marquee:
 
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee 
tool from the Marquee flyout 
menu on the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a dotted ellipse. 
You can also press M to access 
this tool, if it’s visible. If it isn’t, 
press Shift+M.
 
2. Position the crosshair near the area you 
want to select and then drag around your 
desired element.
 
 With this tool, you drag from a given point 
on the ellipse. While you drag, the selection 
border appears.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with your selection, 
release the mouse button.
 
 Your elliptical selection is done, as shown 
in Figure 7-2. If your selection isn’t quite 
centered around your element, simply move 
the selection border by dragging inside the 
border.
 
You can move a selection while you’re making it 
with either of the Marquee tools by holding down 
the spacebar while you’re dragging.

to create rectangular selections.

Marquee is perfect for

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Perfecting squares and circles with 
Shift and Alt or Option
Sometimes, you need to create a perfectly square or circular selection. To do 
so, simply press the Shift key after you begin dragging. After you make your 
selection, release the mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
When you’re making an elliptical selection, making the selection from the 
center outward is often easier. To draw from the center, first click the mouse 
button where you want to position the center, press Alt (Option on the Mac), 
and then drag. When you make your selection, release the mouse button first 
and then release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
If you want to draw from the center outward and create a perfect circle or 
square, press the Shift key, as well. After you make your selection, release the 
mouse button and then release the Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) keys.
Applying marquee options
The Marquee tools offer additional options when you need to make precise 
selections at specific measurements. You also find options for making your 
selections soft around the edges.
 
The only thing to remember is that you must select the options on the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 7-3, before you make your selection with the 
Marquee tools. Options can’t be applied after the selection has already been 
made. The exception is that you can feather a selection after the fact by 
choosing Select➪Feather.
Figure 7-3: Apply marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here are the various marquee options available to you:
 
✓ Feather: Feathering creates soft edges around your selection. The 
amount of softness depends on the value, from 0 to 250 pixels, you enter. 
The higher the value, the softer the edges, as shown in Figure 7-4. Very 
small amounts of feathering can be used to create subtle transitions 
between selected elements in a collage or for blending an element into an 
existing background. Larger amounts are often used when you’re combin-
ing multiple layers so that one image gradually fades into another. If you 
want a selected element to have just a soft edge without the background, 
simply choose Select➪Inverse and delete the background. See more on 
inversing selections in the “Modifying Your Selections” section, later in 
this chapter. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.

 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

Figure 7-4: Feathering creates soft-edged selections.
 
 Don’t forget that those soft edges represent partially selected pixels.
 
✓ Anti-alias: Anti-aliasing barely softens the edge of an elliptical or irregu-
larly shaped selection so that the jagged edges aren’t quite so obvious. 
An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide. We recommend leaving 
this option checked for your selections. It can help to create natural 
transitions between multiple selections when you’re creating collages.
 
✓ Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
 
• Normal: The default setting, which allows you to freely drag a 
selection of any size.
 
• Fixed Ratio: Lets you specify a fixed ratio of width to height. For 
example, if you enter 3 for width and 1 for height, you get a selec-
tion that’s three times as wide as it is high, no matter what the size.
 
• Fixed Size: Lets you specify desired values for the width and 
height. This setting can be useful when you need to make several 
selections that must be the same size.

148
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ Width and Height: When you select Fixed Ratio or Fixed Size from the 
Mode drop-down list, you must also enter your desired values in the 
Width and Height text boxes. To swap the Width and Height values, click 
the double-headed arrow button between the two measurements.
 
 The default unit of measurement in the Width and Height text boxes is 
pixels (px), but that doesn’t mean that you’re stuck with it. You can 
enter any unit of measurement that Elements recognizes — pixels, 
inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), points (pt), picas 
(pica), or percentages (%). Type your value and then type the word or 
abbreviation of your unit of measurement.
Making Freeform Selections with the Lasso Tools
As we all know, you can’t select everything with a rectangle or an ellipse. Life 
is just way too freeform for that. Most animate, and many inanimate, objects 
have undulations of varying sorts. Luckily, Elements anticipated the need to 
capture these and provided the Lasso tools.
The Lasso tools enable you to make any freehand selection you can think of. 
Elements generously provides three types of lasso tools:
 
✓ Lasso
 
✓ Polygonal
 
✓ Magnetic
Although all three tools are designed to make freeform selections, they differ 
slightly in their methodology, as we explain in the sections that follow.
To use these tools, all that’s really required is a steady hand. You’ll find that 
the more you use the Lasso tools, the better you become at your tracing 
technique. Don’t worry if your initial lasso selection isn’t super accurate. You 
can always go back and make corrections by adding and deleting from your 
selection. To find out how, see the section, “Modifying Your Selections,” later 
in this chapter.
 
If you find that you really love the Lasso tools, you may want to invest in a 
digital drawing tablet and stylus. This device makes tracing, and also drawing 
and painting, on the computer more comfortable. It better mimics pen and 
paper, and many users swear that they’ll never go back to a mouse after 
trying it out.

149
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Selecting with the Lasso tool
Using the Lasso tool is the digital version of tracing an outline around an 
object on a piece of paper. It’s that easy. And you have only three choices 
on the Options bar — Feather, Anti-alias, and Refine Edge. To find out more 
about Feather and Anti-alias, see the section, “Applying marquee options,” 
earlier in this chapter. For the scoop on Refine Edge, see the section, 
“Wielding the wand to select,” later in this chapter.
Here’s how to make a selection with the Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 It’s the tool that looks like a rope. You can also just press the L key. If the 
Lasso tool isn’t visible, press Shift+L to cycle through the various Lasso 
flavors.
 
2. Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the object you want to 
select.
 
 The leading point of the cursor is the protruding end of the rope, as 
shown in Figure 7-5. Don’t be afraid to zoom in to your object if you need 
to see the edge more distinctly. In this figure, we started at the upper-left 
corner of the butterfly’s wing.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
3. Hold down the mouse button and trace around your desired object.
 
 Try to include only what you want to select. While you trace around 
your object, an outline follows the mouse cursor.
 
 Try not to release the mouse button until you return to your starting 
point. When you release the mouse button, Elements assumes that 
you’re done and closes the selection from wherever you released the 
mouse button to your starting point, creating a straight line across your 
image.
 
4. Continue tracing around the object and return to your starting point; 
release the mouse button to close the selection.
 
 You see a selection border that matches your lasso line. Look for a small 
circle that appears next to your lasso cursor when you return to your 
starting point. This icon indicates that you are closing the selection at 
the proper spot.
Getting straight with the Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool has a specific mission in life: to select any element 
whose sides are straight. Think pyramids, stairways, skyscrapers, barns — 
you get the idea. It also works a tad differently from the Lasso tool. You don’t 
drag around the element with the Polygonal Lasso. Instead, you click and 
release the mouse button at the corners of the element you’re selecting. The 
Polygonal Lasso tool acts like a stretchy rubber band.
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you get the 
Polygonal Lasso tool.
 
2. Click and release at any point to start the Polygonal Lasso selection 
line.
 
 We usually start at a corner.
 
3. Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click at the next corner of the object. 
Continue clicking and moving to each corner of your element.
 
 Notice how the line stretches out from each point you click.
 
4. Return to your starting point and click to close the selection.
 
 Be on the lookout for a small circle that appears next to your lasso 
cursor when you return to your starting point. This circle is an indica-
tion that you’re indeed closing the selection at the right spot.
 
 Note that you can also double-click at any point, and Elements closes 
the selection from that point to the starting point.

151
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
 After you close the polygonal 
lasso line, a selection border 
should appear, as shown in 
Figure 7-6.
Snapping with the 
Magnetic Lasso tool
The third member of the Lasso team 
is the Magnetic Lasso. We aren’t 
huge fans of this Lasso tool, which 
sometimes can be hard to work with. 
But we show you how it works so 
that you can decide whether to use 
it. The Magnetic Lasso tool works by 
defining the areas of the most con-
trast in an image and then snapping 
to the edge between those areas, as 
though the edge has a magnetic pull.
 
You have the most success using the 
Magnetic Lasso tool on an image that 
has a well-defined foreground object and high contrast between that element 
and the background — for example, a dark mountain range against a light sky.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings, which you can adjust 
on the Options bar before you start selecting:
 
✓ Width: Determines how close to the edge (between 1 and 256 pixels) 
you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to 
that edge. Use a lower value if the edge has a lot of detail or if the con-
trast in the image is low. Use a higher value for high-contrast images or 
smoother edges.
 
✓ Edge Contrast: Specifies the percentage of contrast (from 1 percent to 
100 percent) that’s required before the Magnetic Lasso snaps to an edge. 
Use a higher percentage if your image has good contrast between your 
desired element and the background.
 
✓ Frequency: Specifies how many fastening points (from 1 to 100) to place 
on the selection line. The higher the value, the greater number of points. 
As a general rule, if the element you want to select has a smooth edge, 
keep the value low. If the edge has a lot of detail, try a higher value.
 
✓ Tablet Pressure (pen icon): If you’re the proud owner of a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus 
pressure cause the edge width to decrease.

Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you select the 
Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a straight-sided lasso with a 
little magnet on it.
 
2. Click the edge of the object you want to select to place the first fasten-
ing point.
 
 Fastening points anchor the selection line, as shown in Figure 7-7. You 
can start anywhere; just be sure to click the edge between the element 
you want and the background you don’t want.

Figure 7-7: The Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to the edge of your element and places fastening 
points to anchor the selection.
 
3. Continue to move your cursor around the object, without clicking.
 
 While the selection line gets pinned down with fastening points, only the 
newest portion of the selection line remains active.
 
 If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the desired edge of your 
object, back up your mouse and click to force down a fastening point. 

153
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Conversely, if the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a fastening point where you 
don’t want one, press your Backspace (Delete on the Mac) key to delete 
it. Note that successive presses of the Backspace or Delete key continue 
to remove the fastening points.
 
 If the Magnetic Lasso isn’t cooperating, you can temporarily switch to the 
other Lasso tools. To select the Lasso tool, hold down Alt (Option on 
the Mac) and then click the mouse button and drag. To select the 
Polygonal Lasso tool, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and click.
 
4. Return to your starting point and click the mouse button to close the 
selection.
 
 You see a small circle next to your cursor, indicating that you’re at the 
right spot to close the selection. You can also double-click, whereby 
Elements closes the selection from where you double-clicked to your 
starting point. The selection border appears when the selection is closed.
Working Wizardry with the Magic Wand
The Magic Wand tool is one of the oldest tools in the world of digital imaging. 
This beloved tool has been around since both Photoshop and Elements were 
in their infancies. It’s extremely easy to use, but a little harder to predict what 
selection results it will present.
Here’s how it works: You click inside the image, and the Magic Wand tool 
makes a selection. This selection is based on the color of the pixel you 
clicked. If other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements 
includes them in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, is 
how to determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool 
to select it. Fortunately, that’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. In the 
sections that follow, we first introduce you to this setting and then explain 
how to put the Magic Wand to work.
Talking about tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand tool 
selects. It’s based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255:
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the whole image.
The default setting is 32, so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes the 
value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness levels 
are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.

154
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge 
problem. You can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand to pick up addi-
tional pixels that you want to include in the selection. You can find out how in 
the section, “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this chapter. Or, you can try 
a higher Tolerance setting. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, you 
can also lower your Tolerance setting.
 
So, you can see by our talk on tolerance that the Magic Wand tool works best 
when you have high-contrast images or images with a limited number of 
colors. For example, the optimum image for the Wand would be a solid black 
object on a white background. Skip the wand if the image has a ton of colors 
and no real definitive contrast between your desired element and the back-
ground.
Wielding the wand to select
To use the Magic Wand tool to adjust Tolerance settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Magic Wand tool 
from the Tools panel.
 
 You can’t miss it. It looks like 
a wand with a starburst on the 
end. You can also just press W.
 
2. Click anywhere on your 
desired element, using the 
default Tolerance setting of 32.
 
 Remember that the pixel you 
click determines the base color.
 
 If the pixel gods are with you 
and you selected everything 
you want on the first click, 
you’re done. If your selection 
needs further tweaking, like the 
top image shown in Figure 7-8, 
continue to Step 3.
 
3. Specify a new Tolerance setting 
on the Options bar.
 
 If the Magic Wand selects 
more than you want, lower the 
Tolerance setting. If the wand 
didn’t select enough, increase 
the value. While you’re poking 
around the Options bar, here 
are a couple more options to 
get familiar with:
Tolerance 32
Tolerance 80

based on a specified Tolerance setting.

155
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
• Anti-Alias: Softens the edge of the selection by one row of pixels. 
See the section, “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for details.
 
• Contiguous: Forces the Magic Wand to select only pixels that are 
adjacent to each other. Without this option, the tool selects all 
pixels within the range of tolerance, whether or not they’re adja-
cent to each other.
 
• Sample All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this 
option, the Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. 
Without this option, the tool selects pixels from the active layer 
only. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
 
• Refine Edge: Clean up your selection by moving the Smooth slider 
to reduce the amount of jagginess in your edges. Feather works like 
the feather option discussed in the “Applying marquee options” 
section, earlier in the chapter. Move the Contract/Expand slider to 
the left or right to decrease or increase the selected area, respec-
tively. Click the custom overlay color button to preview your selec-
tion with your edges hidden and an overlay of screen-only color in 
your unselected area. For more details, see the section, “Refining 
the edges of a selection,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Click your desired element again.
 
 Unfortunately, the Magic Wand tool isn’t magical enough to modify your 
first selection automatically. Instead, it deselects the current selection 
and makes a new selection based on your new Tolerance setting. If it still 
isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. Try, try again.
Modifying Your Selections
It’s time for a seventh-inning stretch in this chapter on selection tools. In this 
section, you can find out how to refine that Marquee, Lasso, or Magic Wand 
selection to perfection. Although these tools do an okay job of capturing the 
bulk of your selection, if you take the time to add or subtract a bit from your 
selection border, you can ensure that you get only what you really want.
 
You’re not limited to the manual methods described in the following sections, 
or even to keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the four selection option 
buttons on the left side of the Options bar to create a new selection (the 
default), add to a selection, subtract from a selection, or intersect one selec-
tion with another. Just choose your desired selection tool, click the selection 
option button you want, and drag (or click if you’re using the Magic Wand or 
Polygonal Lasso tool). The Add to Selection and Subtract from Selection but-
tons are also available when you’re using the Selection Brush, explained later 

156
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
in this chapter. When you’re adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) 
appears next to your cursor. When you’re subtracting from a selection, a 
small minus sign (–) appears. When you’re intersecting two selections, a 
small multiplication sign (×) appears. 
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all the elements you want to capture, 
you need to add those portions to your current selection border. To add to 
a current marquee selection, simply press the Shift key and drag around the 
area you want to include. If you’re using the Polygonal Lasso, click around 
the area. And, if you’re wielding the Magic Wand, just press the Shift key and 
click the area you want.
 
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used to 
create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you 
think can get the job done. For example, it’s very common to start off with 
the Magic Wand and fine-tune with the Lasso tool.
Subtracting from a selection
Got too much? To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt (Option on 
the Mac) key and drag the marquee around the pixels you want to subtract. 
With the Alt (Option on the Mac) key, use the same method for the Magic 
Wand and Polygonal Lasso as you do for adding to a selection.
Intersecting two selections
Get your fingers in shape. To intersect your existing selection with a second 
selection, press Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) and drag with the Lasso 
tool. Or, if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso, press those keys 
and click rather than drag.
Avoiding key collisions
If you read the beginning of this chapter, you found out that by pressing the Shift 
key, you get a perfectly square or circular selection. We told you in the section, 
“Adding to a selection,” earlier in this chapter, that if you want to add to a 
selection, you press the Shift key. What if you want to create a perfect square 
while adding to the selection? Or, what if you want to delete part of a selec-
tion while also drawing from the center outward? Both require the use of the 

157
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Alt (Option on the Mac) key. How in the heck does Elements know what you 
want? Here are a few tips to avoid keyboard collisions — grab your desired 
Marquee tool:
 
✓ To add a square or circular selection, press Shift and drag. While you 
drag, keep the mouse button pressed, release the Shift key for just a 
second, and then press it again. Your added selection area suddenly 
snaps into a square or circle. You must then release the mouse button 
first and then release the Shift key.
 
✓ To delete from an existing selection while drawing from the center 
outward, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag. While you drag, keep 
the mouse button pressed, release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key for 
just a second, and then press it down again. You’re now drawing from 
the center outward. Again, release the mouse button first and then 
release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If you like the organic feel of painting on a canvas, you’ll appreciate the 
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas 
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to 
select. This great tool also lets you make a basic, rudimentary selection with 
another tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing 
additional pixels into or out of the selection.
Here’s the step-by-step process of selecting with the Selection Brush:
 
1. Select the Selection Brush from the Tools panel.
 
 Or simply press the A key. Press Shift+A if the Quick Selection tool is 
visible.
 
 This tool works in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
 
2. Specify your Selection Brush options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s the rundown on each option:
 
• Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down panel. 
To load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to 
the left of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your 
choice. You can select the Load Brushes command from the panel 
pop-up menu.
 
• Brush Size: Specify a brush size, from 1 to 2500 pixels. Enter the 
value or drag the slider.

158
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
• Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to 
add to your selection and choose Mask to subtract from your 
selection. If you choose Mask mode, you must choose some addi-
tional overlay options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows 
onscreen only) that hovers over your image, indicating protected 
or unselected areas. You must also choose an overlay opacity 
between 1 and 100 percent (which we describe in a Tip paragraph 
at the end of this section). You can also change the overlay color 
from the default red to another color. This option can be helpful if 
your image contains a lot of red.
 
• Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.
 
3. If your mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to 
select.
 
 You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you inad-
vertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt (Option on 
the Mac) key and paint over the undesired area. After you finish painting 
what you want, your selection is ready to go.
 
4. If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas that you don’t want 
to select.
 
 This mode does the opposite of Selection mode. When you’re done 
painting your mask, choose Selection from the Mode drop-down list, or 
simply choose another tool from the Tools panel, in order to convert 
your mask into a selection border.
 
 While you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds more 
to the overlay area, as shown in Figure 7-9. When working in Mask mode, 
you’re essentially covering up, or masking, the areas you want to protect 
from manipulation. That manipulation can be selecting, adjusting color, or 
performing any other Elements command. Again, if you want to remove 
parts of the masked area, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and paint.
 
 If you painted your selection in Mask mode, your selection border is 
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose 
Select➪Inverse.
 
 Which mode should you choose? Well, it’s up to you. But one advantage 
to working in Mask mode is that you can partially select areas. By paint-
ing with soft brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges 
result in partially selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a 
lower percentage, your pixels are even less opaque, or “less selected.” If 
this partially selected business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this 
is also what happens when you feather selections, as we discuss in the 
section, “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter.

Painting with the Quick Selection Tool
Think of the Quick Selection tool as a combination Brush, Magic Wand, and 
Lasso tool. Good news — it lives up to its “quick” moniker. Better news — 
it’s also easy to use. The best news? It gives pretty decent results, so give it 
a whirl.
Here’s how to make short work of selecting with this tool:
 
1. Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
 
 The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares the 
same flyout menu with the Selection Brush tool. You can also press the 
A key. Press Shift+A if the Selection Brush is visible.
 
 This tool works in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.

160
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
2. Specify the options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s a description of the options:
 
• New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new 
selection. There are also options to add to and subtract from your 
selection.
 
• Brush Picker: Choose your desired brush settings. Specify the diam-
eter, from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also specify hardness, spacing, 
angle, and roundness settings. For details on these settings, see 
Chapter 12.
 
• Sample All Layers: If your image has layers and you want to make a 
selection from all the layers, select this option. If you leave it unse-
lected, you will select only from the current layer.
 
• Auto-Enhance: Check this option to have Elements automatically 
refine your selection by implementing an algorithm.
 
3. Drag, or paint, the desired areas of your image.
 
 Your selection grows as you drag, as shown in Figure 7-10. If you stop 
dragging and click in another portion of your image, your selection 
includes that clicked area.
 
4. Add to or delete from your selection, as desired:
 
• To add to your selection: 
Press the Shift key while 
dragging across your 
desired image areas.
 
• To delete from your selec-
tion: Press the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key while 
dragging across your 
unwanted image areas.
 
 You can also select the Add 
to Selection and Subtract 
from Selection options on the 
Options bar.
 
5. If you need to fine-tune your selection, click the Refine Edge option on 
the Options bar and then change the settings, as desired.
 
 The settings are explained in detail in the “Refining the edges of a selec-
tion” section, later in this chapter.
 
 Note that if your object is fairly detailed, you may even need to break 
out the Lasso or another selection tool to make some final cleanups. 
Eventually, you should arrive at a selection you’re happy with.

 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Resizing Smartly with the Recompose Tool
 
The new Recompose tool is like an uber-intelligent crop-and-transform tool. 
You can move elements closer together or even change the orientation of a 
landscape shot from horizontal to vertical without sacrificing your most vital 
content.
Here’s how this great new tool works:
 
1. In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select the Recompose tool from the 
Tools panel.
 
 This tool shares the same flyout menu with the Crop tool. You can also 
press the C key. Press Shift+A if the Crop tool is visible.
 
2. (Optional) Using the Brushes and Erasers in the Options bar, mark the 
areas you want to protect and eliminate. 
 
 Although this step isn’t mandatory, it will help to give you better results.
 
 Here’s a description of these tools:
 
• Mark for Protect Brush: Brush over the areas of the image you want 
to protect or retain (strokes will be green). You don’t have to be 
super precise; just give Elements an inkling of what you want to keep 
(or remove, in the case of 
the next brush), as shown 
in Figure 7-11.
 
• Mark for Removal Brush: 
Brush over those areas 
you want to remove first 
(strokes will be red). Make 
sure to choose the area 
you don’t mind eliminating 
at all.
 
• Erase Highlight Marked for 
Protection: Use this tool to 
erase any area you errone-
ously marked to retain.
 
• Erase Highlights Marked for Removal: Use this tool to erase any area 
you erroneously marked to remove.
 
3. Specify the other options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s a description of those options:
 
• Brush Size: Click the down-pointing arrow and drag the slider to 
make the brush diameter smaller or larger.
Purestock
Figure 7-11: Mark areas that you want to retain 
or remove.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
• Suggest Skin Tone Region: Select this option to prevent skin tones 
from being distorted when scaled.
 
• Presets: Use a preset ratio or size to which to recompose your 
image. Or leave on the default of No Restriction.
 
• Width and Height: Enter width and height scale percentages if 
desired.
 
• Amount: Set a recomposition threshold to help minimize distortion. 
Start with a higher percentage, and then adjust as needed.
 
4. Grab the image handle and resize your image.
 
 As you drag, you’ll notice the 
red areas are removed first and 
the green areas remain intact. 
After all the red areas have been 
removed, Elements begins to 
“carve” out areas you didn’t 
mark to protect.
 
5. After you have recomposed 
your image as desired, click 
the Commit (green) check 
mark icon to accept the 
composition.
Retouch any areas as needed with 
the Clone Stamp or Healing tools. 
For our example, shown in Figure 7-12, 
we cloned noticeable seams near the man’s feet and some of the 
sandy areas.
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. You can 
think of it as a Custom Shape tool for images. But, whereas the Custom Shape 
tool creates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the Cookie 
Cutter cuts away everything outside the shape. The preset libraries offer 
you a large variety of interesting shapes, from talk bubbles to Swiss cheese. 
(We’re not being funny here — check out the food library.)
Here’s the lowdown on using the Cookie Cutter:
Purestock
Figure 7-12: A recomposed image.

163
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
1. Choose the Cookie Cutter tool from the Tools panel.
 
 There’s no missing it; it looks like a star. You can also press the Q key.
 
2. Specify your options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s the list:
 
• Shape: Choose a shape from the preset library. To load other 
libraries, click the panel pop-up menu and choose one from the 
submenu.
 
• Shape Options: These options let you draw your shape with certain 
parameters:
 
• Unconstrained: Enables you to draw freely.
 
• Defined Proportions: Enables you to keep the height and width 
proportional.
 
• Defined Size: Crops the image to the original, fixed size of the 
shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or smaller.
 
• Fixed Size: Allows you to enter your desired width and height.
 
• From Center: Allows you to draw the shape from the center 
outward.
 
• Feather: This option creates a soft-edged selection. See the section, 
“Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter, for more 
details.
 
• Crop: Click this option to crop the image into the shape. The shape 
will fill the image window.
 
3. Drag your mouse on the image to create your desired shape, size 
the shape by dragging one of the handles of the bounding box, and 
position the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box and 
dragging.
 
 You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating 
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Chapter 9.
 
4. Click the Commit button on the Options bar or press Enter to finish 
the cutout.
 
 See Figure 7-13 to see my image cut into an elephant shape. If you want 
to bail out of the bounding box and not cut out, you can always click the 
Cancel button on the Options bar or press Esc.

Eliminating with the Eraser Tools
The Eraser tools let you erase areas of your image. Elements has three eraser 
tools: the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser. The 
Eraser tools look like those pink erasers you used in grade school, so you 
can’t miss them. If you can’t locate them, you can always press E and then 
Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
 
When you erase pixels, those pixels are history — they’re gone. So, before 
using the Eraser tools, you should probably have a backup of your image 
stored somewhere. Think of it as a cheap insurance policy in case things go 
awry.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool enables you to erase areas on your image to either your back-
ground color or, if you’re working on a layer, a transparent background, as 
shown in Figure 7-14. For more on layers, check out Chapter 8.

165
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
To use this tool, simply select it 
and drag through the desired area 
on your image, and you’re done. 
Because it isn’t the most accurate 
tool on the planet, remember to 
zoom way in and use smaller brush 
tips to do some accurate erasing.
You have several Eraser options to 
specify on the Options bar:
 
✓ Brush Presets: Click the drop-
down panel to access the Brush 
presets. Choose the brush of 
your choice. Again, additional brush libraries are available on the 
Brushes pop-up menu.
 
✓ Size: Click the down-pointing arrow to access the Size slider. Choose a 
brush size between 1 and 2500 pixels.
 
✓ Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Block, 
you’re stuck with one size (a 16-x-16-pixel tip) and can’t select other 
preset brushes.
 
✓ Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for your erased areas. 
The lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. Opacity isn’t available 
in Block mode.
The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool, which is more savvy than the Eraser tool, erases 
the background from an image while being mindful of leaving the foreground 
untouched. The Background Eraser tool erases to transparency on a layer. If 
you use this tool on an image with only a background, Elements converts the 
background into a layer.
 
The key to using the Background Eraser is to carefully keep the hot spot, the 
crosshair at the center of the brush, on the background pixels while you 
drag. The hot spot samples the color of the pixels and deletes that color 
whenever it falls inside the brush circumference. But, if you accidentally 
touch a foreground pixel with the hot spot, it’s erased as well. And the tool 
isn’t even sorry about it! This tool works better with images that have good 
contrast in color between the background and foreground objects, as shown 
in Figure 7-15. If your image has very detailed or wispy edges (such as hair or 
fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor command, which we describe 
in the section, “Using the Magic Extractor Command,” later in this chapter.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-14: Erase either to your background 
color (left) or to transparency (right).

166
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Here’s the rundown on the Background Eraser options:
 
✓ Brush Preset Picker: This 
option provides settings to cus-
tomize the size and appearance 
of your brush tip. The Size and 
Tolerance settings at the bottom 
are for pressure-sensitive draw-
ing tablets.
 
✓ Limits: Discontiguous erases all 
similarly colored pixels wher-
ever they appear in the image. 
Contiguous erases all similarly 
colored pixels that are adjacent 
to those under the hot spot.
 
✓ Tolerance: The percentage 
determines how similar the 
colors have to be to that of the 
color under the hot spot before Elements erases them. A higher value 
picks up more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer colors. See 
the section, “Talking about tolerance,” earlier in this chapter, for more 
details.
The Magic Eraser tool
You can think of the Magic Eraser tool as a combination Eraser and Magic 
Wand tool. It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. Unless 
you’re working on a layer with the transparency locked (see Chapter 8 for 
more on locking), the pixels are erased to transparency. If you’re working on an 
image with just a background, Elements converts the background into a layer.
The Magic Eraser shares most of the same options with the other erasers. 
Here are the unique options:
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 
✓ Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers but 
erases pixels on the active layer only.
Using the Magic Extractor Command
The last selection tool in the Elements repertoire is the Magic Extractor 
command. This command enables you to make selections based on your 
identification of the foreground and background portions of your image. 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-15: The Background Eraser erases 
similarly colored pixels sampled by the hot 
spot of your brush cursor.

167
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
The way this tool works is you specify your foreground and background by 
simply clicking these areas with the brush tool and “marking” them. Click 
the magic OK button, and your object or objects are neatly and painlessly 
extracted.
 
Although it isn’t mandatory, you can make a rough selection first before 
selecting the Magic Extractor command. This technique obviously restricts 
what’s extracted and can result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
 
1. Choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
 
 The huge Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
 
2. Grab the Foreground Brush tool, and click or drag to mark your fore-
ground areas — or the areas you want to select.
 
 The default color of the Foreground Brush is red.
 
 Like with the Selection Brush, the more accurate the data you provide 
to the command’s algorithm, the more accurate your extraction. Be sure 
to use the Zoom and Hand tools to help magnify and move around your 
image, as needed. For more on these tools, see Chapter 5.
 
 You can also change the size of your brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels) in 
the Tool Options area on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary, 
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking 
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
 
3. Select the Background Brush tool, and click or drag to mark the back-
ground area or the portions you don’t want to select, as shown in 
Figure 7-16.
 
 The default color of the Background Brush is blue.
 
4. Click Preview to view your extraction.
 
 Elements churns for a few seconds before presenting you with a look 
at your extraction. You can change the preview by choosing either 
Selection Area or Original Photo from the Display pop-up list.
 
 If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose 
one, such as black matte for a black background, from the Background 
pop-up list.

Figure 7-16: The Magic Extractor allows you to identify foreground and 
background areas.
 
5. If you aren’t happy with the preview of your selection, you can refine 
the selection:
 
• To erase any markings: Select the Point Eraser tool, and click or 
drag over the offending areas.
 
• To add areas to the selection: Click or drag over your desired areas 
with the Add to Selection tool.
 
• To delete areas from the selection: Drag with the Remove from 
Selection tool.
 
• To smooth the edges of your foreground selection: Drag over the 
edges with the Smoothing Brush tool.
 
• To soften the edges of your selection: Enter a value in the Feather 
box. Remember: The higher the value, the softer the edge.
 
• To fill a hole: Click the aptly named Fill Holes button.
 
• To remove the halo of pixels between the foreground and background 
areas: Click Defringe. Enter a value in the Defringe Width box.
 
 If things start to get messy, you can always start over by clicking Reset 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
6. When you’re pleased with the results, click OK to finish the selection 
process and close the Magic Extractor dialog box.
 
 Your newly extracted image appears, as shown in Figure 7-17.

Using the Select Menu
In the following sections, we breeze through the Select menu. Along with the 
methods we describe in the “Modifying Your Selections” section, earlier in this 
chapter, you can use this menu to further modify selections by expanding, 
contracting, smoothing, softening, inversing, growing, and grabbing similarly 
colored pixels. If that doesn’t satisfy your selection needs, nothing will.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are no-brainers. To select everything 
in your image, choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Ô+A on the Mac). To 
deselect everything, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the 
Mac). Remember that you usually don’t have to Select All. If you don’t have 
a selection border in your image, Elements assumes that the whole image is 
fair game for any manipulation.
Reselecting a selection
If you sacrifice that second cup of coffee to steady your hand and take the 
time to carefully lasso around your desired object, you don’t want to lose 
your selection before you have a chance to perform your next move. But all 
it takes is a mere inadvertent click of your mouse while you have an active 

170
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
selection border to obliterate your selection. Fortunately, Elements antici-
pated such a circumstance and offers a solution. If you choose Select➪
Reselect, Elements retrieves your last selection.
 
One caveat: The Reselect command works only for the last selection you 
made, so don’t plan to reselect a selection you made last Tuesday or even 
just five minutes ago, if you selected something else after that selection. If 
you want to reuse a selection for the long term, save it as we explain in 
“Saving and loading selections” later in this chapter.
Inversing a selection
You know the old song lyric: If you can’t be with the one you love, love the 
one you’re with. Well, Elements is kind of like that. Sometimes, it’s just easier 
to select what you don’t want rather than what you do want. For example, if 
you’re trying to select your beloved in his or her senior photo, it’s probably 
easier to just click the studio backdrop with the Magic Wand and then inverse 
the selection by choosing Select➪Inverse.
Feathering a selection
In the “Applying marquee options” section earlier in this chapter, we describe 
how to feather a selection when using the Lasso and Marquee tools by 
entering a value in the Feather box on the Options bar. Remember that this 
method of feathering requires that you set the Feather value before you 
create your selection. What we didn’t tell you is that there’s a way to apply a 
feather after you make a selection.
Choose Select➪Feather and enter your desired amount from .2 to 250 pixels. 
Your selection is subsequently softened around the edges.
 
This method is actually a better way to go. Make your selection and fine-tune 
it by using the methods we describe earlier in this chapter. Then, apply your 
feather. The problem with applying the feather before you make a selection 
happens when you want to modify your initial selection. When you make a 
selection with a feather, the marquee outline of the selection adjusts to take 
into account the amount of the feather. So, the resulting marquee outline 
doesn’t resemble your precise mouse movement, making it harder to modify 
that selection.
Refining the edges of a selection
The Refine Edge option enables you to fine-tune the edges of your selection. 
It doesn’t matter how you got the selection, just that you have one. You can 
find the command in the Options bar of the Magic Wand, Lasso, and Quick 
Selection tools. And, of course, you can find it in the Select menu. Here’s the 
scoop on each of the settings in this option:

171
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
✓ Smooth: Reduces jaggedness along your selection edges.
 
✓ Feather: Moves the slider to create an increasingly softer, more blurred 
edge.
 
✓ Contract/Expand: Decreases or increases the selected area. The contract 
and expand features are discussed in more detail in the next section, 
“Using the Modify commands.”
 
✓ Background icons: Enables you to preview your selection in Standard 
or Overlay mode. Click the custom overlay color button to preview your 
selection with your edges hidden and a semi-opaque layer of color (that 
shows onscreen only) in your unselected area. Double-click this icon to 
change the color and opacity of the overlay. Press F to cycle between 
standard and overlay views. And press X to hide your selection edges.
 
✓ Zoom tool: Allows you to zoom in to your image to see the effects of 
your settings.
 
✓ Hand tool: Enables you to pan around your image window to see the 
effects of your settings.
Using the Modify commands
Although the commands on the Modify submenu definitely won’t win any 
popularity contests, they may occasionally come in handy. Here’s the scoop 
on each command:
 
✓ Border: Selects the area, from 1 to 200 pixels, around the edge of the 
selection border. By choosing Edit➪Fill Selection, you can fill the border 
with color, as shown in Figure 7-18.
 
✓ Smooth: Rounds off any jagged, raggedy edges. Enter a value from 1 to 
100 pixels, and Elements looks at each selected pixel and then includes 
or deselects the pixels in your 
selection based on your chosen 
value. Start with a low number, 
like 1, 2, or 3 pixels. Otherwise, 
it may make your selection 
worse.
 
✓ Expand: Enables you to increase 
the size of your selection by a 
given number of pixels, from 1 to 
100. This command is especially 
useful if you just barely missed 
getting the edge of an elliptical 
selection and need it to be a little 
larger.

stroke around your object.

172
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ Contract: Decreases your selection border by 1 to 100 pixels. When 
you’re compositing multiple images, you often benefit by slightly con-
tracting your selection if you plan on applying a feather. That way, you 
avoid picking up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often used in tandem with the Magic 
Wand tool. If you made an initial selection with the Magic Wand but didn’t 
quite get everything you want, try choosing Select➪Grow. The Grow com-
mand increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall 
within the range of tolerance. The Similar command is like Grow except that 
the pixels don’t have to be adjacent to be selected. The command searches 
throughout the image and picks up pixels within the tolerance range.
These commands don’t have their own tolerance options. They use whatever 
Tolerance value is displayed on the Options bar when the Magic Wand tool 
is selected. You can adjust that Tolerance setting to include more or fewer 
colors.
Saving and loading selections
At times, you toil so long over a complex selection that you really want to 
save it for future use. Saving it isn’t only possible, but also highly recom-
mended. It’s also a piece a cake. Here’s how:
 
1. After you perfect your selection, choose Select➪Save Selection.
 
2. In the Save Selection dialog box, leave the Selection option set to New 
and enter a name for your selection, as shown in Figure 7-19.
 
 The operation is automatically 
set to New Selection.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. When you want to access 
the selection again, choose 
Select➪Load Selection and 
choose a selection from the 
Selection drop-down list.

save time and effort.

▶ Creating new layers
▶ Moving and transforming layers
▶ Merging and flattening layers
U
sing Elements without ever using layers would be like typing a book on 
an old IBM Selectric typewriter: Sure, you could do it, but it wouldn’t be 
fun. An even bigger issue would occur when it came time to edit that book and 
make changes. Correction tape, Wite-Out, and erasers would make 
that task downright tedious, not to mention messy. The benefit 
of using layers is that you have tremendous flexibility. You 
can quickly make as many edits as you want for as long 
as you want, as long as you keep your composite image 
in layers. Layers make working in Elements a lot more 
productive. Don’t give a darn about productivity? 
Well, let’s just say that layers also make it a breeze 
for you to dabble in your more artsy side. This 
chapter explains the tools and techniques you need 
to start working with layers. After you try them out, 
you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.
Getting to Know Layers
Think of layers as sheets of acetate or clear transparency film. 
You have drawings or photographs on individual sheets. What you 
place on each sheet doesn’t affect any of the other sheets. Any area on the 
sheet that doesn’t have an image on it is transparent. You can stack these 
sheets on top of the others to create a combined image, or composite (or col-
lage, if you prefer). You can reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new sheets, 
and delete old sheets.

174
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
In Elements, layers are essentially digital versions of these clear acetate 
sheets. You can place elements, such as images, text, or shapes on separate 
layers and create a composite, as shown in Figure 8-1. You can hide, add, 
delete, or rearrange layers. Because layers are digital, of course, they have 
added functionality. You can adjust how opaque or transparent the element 
on the layer is. You can also add special effects and change how the colors 
interact between layers.
 
To work with layers, you must be in the Editor in Edit Full mode.
Corbis, PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 8-1: Layers enable you to easily create composite images.
When you create a new file with background contents of white or a back-
ground color, scan an image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your 
digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background. There are no 
layers yet.
An image contains at most one background, and you can’t do much to it 
besides paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t move the back-
ground or change its transparency or blend mode. How do you get around all 
these limitations? Convert your background into a layer by following these 
easy steps:

175
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
1. Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
 
 The Layers panel is explained in detail in the next section.
 
2. Double-click Background on the Layers panel.
 
 Or, choose Layer➪New➪Layer From Background.
 
3. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
 
 You can also adjust the blend mode and opacity of the layer in the New 
Layer dialog box. You can also do it via the Layers panel commands later.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Elements converts your background into a layer, known also as an 
image layer.
 
 When you create a new image with transparent background contents, 
the image doesn’t contain a background but instead is created with a 
single layer.
Anatomy of a Layers panel
Elements keeps layers controlled on its own panel named, not surprisingly, 
the Layers panel. To display the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 8-2, choose 
Window➪Layers in the Editor in Edit Full mode.
The order of the layers on the Layers panel represents the order in the image. 
We refer to this concept in the computer graphics world as the stacking order. 
The top layer on the panel is the 
top layer in your image, and so on. 
Depending on what you’re doing, you 
can work either on a single layer or 
on multiple layers at one time. Here 
are some tips for working with the 
Layers panel:
 
✓ Select a layer. Click a layer 
name or its thumbnail. Elements 
highlights the active layer on the 
panel.
 
✓ Select multiple contiguous 
layers. Click your first layer and 
then Shift-click your last layer.
 
✓ Select multiple noncontiguous 
layers. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the 
Mac) your desired layers.
Figure 8-2: The Layers panel controls layers in 
your image.

176
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ View and hide layers. To hide a layer, click the eye icon for that layer so 
that the eye disappears. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space in 
the eye column. You can also hide all the layers except one by selecting 
your desired layer and Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac) the eye 
icon for that layer. Redisplay all layers by Alt-clicking (Option-clicking 
on the Mac) the eye icon again. Hiding all the layers except the one you 
want to edit can be helpful in allowing you to focus without the distrac-
tion of all the other imagery.
 
 Only layers that are visible are printed. This can be useful if you want 
to have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a 
project within the same file.
 
✓ Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer. 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail (not the name) on 
the panel.
 
✓ Create a new blank layer. Click the Create New Layer icon at the 
bottom of the panel.
 
✓ Create an adjustment layer. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at 
the bottom of the panel. Adjustment layers are special layers that modify 
contrast and color in your image. You can also add fill layers — layers 
containing color, gradients, or patterns — by using this command. 
We give you more details on adjustment and fill layers in the section, 
“Working with Different Layer Types,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon 
at the bottom of the panel.
 
✓ Rearrange layers. To move a layer to another position in the stacking 
order, drag the layer up or down on the Layers panel. While you drag, 
you see a fist icon. Release the mouse button when a highlighted line 
appears where you want to insert the layer.
 
 If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. 
If you need to move the background, convert it to a layer by double-
clicking the name on the Layers panel. Enter a name for the layer and 
click OK.
 
✓ Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides 
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename 
a layer, double-click the layer name on the Layers panel and enter the 
name directly on the Layers panel.
 
✓ Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers. You can use the blend modes and the opacity options 
at the bottom of the panel to mix the colors between layers and adjust 
the transparency of the layers, as shown in Figure 8-3.

177
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers

options.
 
✓ Link layers. Sometimes, you want your layers to stay grouped as a unit 
to make your editing tasks easier. If so, link your layers by selecting the 
layers on the panel and then clicking the Link layers icon at the bottom 
of the panel. A link icon appears to the right of the layer name. To 
remove the link, click the Link Layers icon again.
 
✓ Lock layers. Select your desired layer and then click one of the two lock 
icons at the bottom of the panel. The checkerboard square icon locks all 
transparent areas of your layers. This lock prevents you from painting 
or editing any transparent areas on the layers. The lock icon locks your 
entire layer and prevents it from being changed in any way, including 
moving or transforming the elements on the layer. You can, however, still 
make selections on the layer. To unlock the layer, simply click the icon 
again to toggle off the lock.
 
 By default, the background is locked and can’t be unlocked until you 
convert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer 
from Background.
 
✓ Delete a layer. Drag it to the trash can icon.
Using the Layer and Select menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way to 
do something. This is especially true when it comes to working with layers. 

178
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Besides the commands on the Layers panel, you have two layer menus — 
the Layers menu and the Select menu, both of which you can find on the 
main menu bar at the top of the application window.
The Layers menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers panel icons you can also do by 
using the Layer menu on the menu bar and the Layers panel pop-up menu 
connected to the Layers panel (click the horizontally lined button in the 
upper-right corner). Commands, such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename, 
are omnipresent throughout. But you find commands that are exclusive 
to the Layers panel, the main Layer menu, and the Layers pop-up menu, 
respectively. So, if you can’t find what you’re looking for in one area, just 
go to another. Some commands require an expanded explanation and are 
described in sections that follow. Here’s a quick description of most of the 
commands:
 
✓ Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands 
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display on 
the Layers panel.
 
✓ Layer Style: These commands manage the styles, or special effects, you 
apply to your layers.
 
✓ Arrange: Enables you to shuffle your layer stacking order with com-
mands, such as Bring to Front and Send to Back. Reverse switches the 
order of your layers if you have two or more layers selected.
 
✓ Create Clipping Mask: The Create Clipping Mask command (previously 
known as the Group with Previous command) creates a clipping group, in 
which a group of layers is constrained to the boundaries of a base layer. 
Find more details in the section “Adjustment layers,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Type: The commands in the Type submenu control the display of type 
layers. For more on type, see Chapter 13.
 
✓ Rename Layer: Enables you to give a layer a new name. You can also 
simply double-click the name on the Layers panel.
 
✓ Simplify Layer: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill 
layer into a regular image layer. Briefly, a shape layer contains a vector 
object, and a fill layer contains a solid color, a gradient, or a pattern.
 
✓ Merge and Flatten: The various merge and flatten commands combine 
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine all 
your layers into a single background.
 
✓ Panel Options: You can select display options and choose to use a layer 
mask on your adjustment layers. Leave this option selected.

179
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and refin-
ing your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands, all of which are 
new additions to the menu. Here’s a quick introduction to each command:
 
✓ Select All Layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose 
Select➪All Layers.
 
✓ Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have 
different types of layers in your document, such as regular layers, type 
layers, shape layers, and adjustment layers, and you want to select just 
one type. Select one of your layers and then choose Select➪Similar 
Layers. For details on different types of layers, see the following section.
 
✓ Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.
Working with Different Layer Types
Layer life exists beyond just converting an existing background into a layer, 
which we describe in the section “Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in this 
chapter. In fact, Elements offers five kinds of layers. You’ll probably spend 
most of your time creating image layers, but just so that you’re familiar with 
all types, the following sections describe each one.
Image layers
The image layer, usually just referred to as a layer, is the type of layer 
we’re referring to when we give the analogy of acetate sheets in the section 
“Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in this chapter. You can create blank layers 
and add images to them, or you can create layers from images themselves. 
You can have as many image layers as your computer’s memory allows. Just 
keep in mind that the more layers you have, the larger your file size and the 
slower your computer responds.
Each layer in an image can be edited without affecting the other layers. You 
can move, paint, size, or apply a filter, for example, without disturbing a 
single pixel on any other layer or on the background, for that matter. And, 
when an element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection to 
select it. (See Chapter 7 for selection info.) Just drag the element with the 
Move tool.
We tell you more about how to work with image layers in the section 
“Tackling Layer Basics,” later in this chapter.

180
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind 
of layer used for modifying color and 
contrast. The advantage of using 
adjustment layers for your correc-
tions, rather than applying them 
directly on the image layer, is that 
you can apply the corrections with-
out permanently affecting the pixels. 
Adjustment layers are totally nonde-
structive. And, because the correction 
is on a layer, you can edit, or even 
delete, the adjustment at any time. 
Adjustment layers, as shown in Figure 
8-4, apply the correction only to all 
the layers below them, without affect-
ing any of the layers above them.
 
Another unique feature of adjustment 
layers is that when you create one, 
you also create a layer mask on that 
layer at the same time. A layer mask 
is like a second sheet of acetate that 
hovers over the underlying layers. 
The layer mask allows you to selec-
tively apply the adjustment to the 
layers below it by applying shades of 
gray — from white to black — on the 
mask. For example, by default, the 
mask is completely white. This allows 
the adjustment to be fully applied to 
the layers. If you paint on a layer 
mask with black, the areas under 
those black areas don’t show the 
adjustment. If you paint with a shade 
of gray, those areas partially show the 
adjustment. The darker the shade of 
gray, the less it shows the adjustment, 
as shown in Figure 8-5. Note that if 
you have an active selection border in 
your image before you add an adjust-
ment layer, the adjustment is applied 
only to that area within the selection 
border. The resulting layer mask also 
reflects that selection: The selected 
areas are white, and the unselected 
areas are black.

contrast in your image.

adjustment applied to your layers.

181
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
You can also use just the layer mask to creatively blend two layers. Create an 
adjustment layer and just don’t make any adjustment settings. Then, use the 
layer mask to blend two layers. Be sure to sandwich the layer mask between 
the two layers. Then, select the topmost layer and choose Layer➪Create 
Clipping Mask. Paint on your layer mask, as we describe earlier in this sec-
tion, to selectively hide and show portions of your topmost layer.
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many 
as you want. These adjustments are the same adjustments you find on 
the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and Enhance➪Adjust Color and the Filter➪
Adjustments submenus. For specifics on each adjustment, see Chapters 9 
and 10. Here’s how to create an adjustment layer:
 
1. Open an image that needs a little contrast or color adjustment.
 
 Note that you don’t need to convert your background into a layer to 
apply an adjustment layer.
 
2. Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon at the bottom of 
the Layers panel, and from the drop-down menu, choose your desired 
adjustment.
 
 The Adjustment Layer icon and a thumbnail appear on the adjustment 
layer. The thumbnail represents the layer mask. And the dialog box 
specific to your adjustment appears in the new Adjustments panel.
 
3. Make the necessary adjustments in the Adjustments panel.
 
You can paint on the layer mask to selectively allow only portions of your 
image to receive the adjustment. Use the Brush or Pencil tool to paint. Or, 
you can also make a selection and fill that selection with any shade of gray, 
from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient tool on the mask to 
create a gradual application of the adjustment.
As with image layers, you can adjust the opacity and blend modes of an 
adjustment layer. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer reduces the 
effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
Here are a few more tips on using adjustment layers:
 
✓ To view your image without the adjustment: Click the eye icon in the 
left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer.
 
✓ To delete the adjustment layer: Drag it to the trash can icon on the 
Layers panel.
 
✓ To edit an adjustment layer: Simply double-click the adjustment layer 
on the Layers panel. You can also choose Layer➪Layer Content Options. 
In the dialog box that appears in the Adjustment panel, make any 
desired edits. The only adjustment layer that you can’t edit is the Invert 
adjustment. It’s either on or off.

182
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ To use the new adjustment panel controls: Click an icon. From left to 
right, here’s what the icons do:
 
• Have the adjustment layer clip to the layer below (will affect only 
the layer directly beneath it, not all the underlying layers in the 
stack).
 
• Toggle the adjustment layer on and off.
 
• View the previous state (how the image appeared before your most 
recent step).
 
•  Reset the adjustment layer settings back to the default.
Fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like 
adjustment layers, fill layers also include layer masks. You can edit, rear-
range, duplicate, delete, and merge fill layers similarly to adjustment layers. 
You can blend fill layers with other layers by using the opacity and blend 
mode options on the Layers panel. Finally, you can restrict the fill layer to 
just a portion of your image by either making a selection first or painting on 
the mask later.
Follow these steps to create a fill layer:
 
1. Open an image.
 
 Use an image that will look good with a frame or border of some kind. 
Remember that if you don’t have a selection, the fill layer covers your 
whole image.
 
2. Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers 
panel. From the drop-down menu, choose a fill of a solid color, 
gradient, or pattern.
 
 The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
 
3. Specify your options, depending on the fill type you choose in Step 2:
 
• Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the Color Picker. See 
Chapter 12 for details on choosing colors and also gradients and 
patterns.
 
• Gradient: Click the down-pointing arrow to choose a preset gradi-
ent from the drop-down panel or click the gradient preview to dis-
play the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient.

183
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
• Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down panel. Enter a value 
to scale your pattern, if you want. Click Snap to Origin to make the 
origin of the pattern the same as the origin of the document. Select 
the Link with Layer option to specify that the pattern moves with 
the fill layer if you move that layer.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The fill layer appears on the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 8-6. Notice 
the layer mask that was created on the fill layer.

Shape layers
If you haven’t made your way to Chapter 12 yet, you may be surprised to 
discover that Elements also lets you draw shapes with six different drawing 
tools. These shapes also have the bonus of being vector-based. This term 
means that the shapes are defined by mathematical equations, which create 
points and paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage of vector-based 
objects is that you can freely size these objects without causing degradation. 
In addition, they’re always printed with smooth edges, not with the jaggies 
you’re familiar with seeing in pixel-based elements.

184
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools panel and drag it on 
your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique shape 
layer, as shown in Figure 8-7. As with other types of layers, you can adjust the 
blend modes and opacity of a shape layer. You can edit, move, and transform 
the actual shapes. However, to apply filters, you must first simplify the shape 
layer. This process converts the vector paths to pixels.
Corbis, PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 8-7: Shape layers are vector-based, allowing for smooth edges and optimum print quality.
Type layers
To add words to your images, as shown in Figure 8-7, click your canvas with 
the Type tool and just type. It’s really as easy as that. Well, you can specify 
options, such as a font family and size, on the Options bar, but when you 
click the Commit button on the Options bar, you create a type layer. On the 
Layers panel, you see a layer with a T icon. For details on working with type, 
check out Chapter 13.

185
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
Tackling Layer Basics
Image layers are the heart and soul of the layering world. You can create 
multiple image layers within a single image. Even more fun is creating a com-
posite from several different images. Add people you like; take out people 
you don’t. Pluck people out of boring photo studios and put them in exotic 
locales. The creative possibilities are endless. In the following sections, we 
cover all the various ways to create image layers. We cover how to convert 
a background into a layer in the section “Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in 
this chapter. The following sections describe how to create an image layer by 
using various other methods.
Creating a new layer from scratch
If you’re creating a new, blank file, you can select the Transparent option for 
your background contents. Your new file is created with a transparent layer 
and is ready to go. If you have an existing file and want to create a new, blank 
layer, here are the ways to do so:
 
✓ Click the Create a new layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel.
 
✓ Choose New Layer from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
Note that if you create a layer by using either of the menu commands, you’re 
presented with a dialog box with options. In that dialog box, you can name 
your layer and specify options for grouping, blending, and adjusting opacity. 
Provide a name for your layer and click OK. You can always adjust the other 
options directly on the Layers panel later.
 
You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without even creating a 
blank layer first. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, 
Elements automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. A 
better method of copying and pasting between multiple images, however, is 
to use the drag-and-drop method, which we describe in the section “Dragging 
and dropping layers,” later in this chapter.
 
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all 
visible layers within the selection.
After you create your layer, you can put selections or other elements on that 
layer by doing one or more of the following:

186
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ Grab a painting tool, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint on the layer.
 
✓ Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the same 
document, or from another image entirely, and then choose Edit➪Copy. 
Select your new, blank layer on the Layers panel and then choose Edit➪
Paste. You can also choose 
Select➪All and then copy and 
paste to transfer an entire image 
to the new layer.
 
✓ Make a selection on another 
layer or on the background 
within the same document, 
or from another image, and 
then choose Edit➪Cut. Select 
your new, blank layer and then 
choose Edit➪Paste. Be aware 
that this action removes that 
selection from its original loca-
tion and leaves a transparent 
hole, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut 
commands on the Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background, 
and choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut. Elements automati-
cally creates a new layer and puts the copied or cut selection on the layer. 
Remember that if you use the Layer via the Cut command, your selection 
is deleted from its original location layer, and you’re left with a transparent 
hole. If you use the background for the source, your background color fills 
the space. A reminder: You can use these two commands only within the 
same image. You can’t use them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
Duplicating layers can be helpful if you want to protect your original image 
while experimenting with a technique. If you don’t like the results, you can 
always delete the duplicate layer. No harm, no foul.
To duplicate an existing layer, select it on the Layers panel and do one of 
three things:
 
✓ Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the panel. 
Elements creates a duplicate layer with Copy appended to the name of 
the layer.

layer, take note of the resulting hole in the 
original location.

187
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
✓ Choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer. 
If you use the menu methods, a dialog box appears, asking you to name your 
layer and specify other options. Provide a name for your layer and click OK. 
You can specify the other options later, if you want.
Dragging and dropping layers
The most efficient way to copy and paste layers between multiple images is 
to use the drag-and-drop method. Why? Because it bypasses your Clipboard, 
which is the temporary storage area on your computer for copied data. 
Storing data, especially large files, can bog down your system. By keep-
ing your Clipboard clear of data, your system operates more efficiently. 
If you already copied data and it’s lounging on your Clipboard, choose 
Edit➪Clear➪Clipboard Contents to empty your Clipboard.
Here’s how to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
 
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools panel.
 
3. Drag and drop the layer onto your destination file.
 
 The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the 
image. You don’t need to have a selection border to copy the entire 
layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your 
selection before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you want the 
selected element to be centered on the destination file, press the Shift 
key while you drag and drop.
 
Here’s a handy tip. If you have several elements (that aren’t touching each 
other) on one layer and you want to select only one of the elements to drag 
and drop, use the Lasso tool to make a crude selection around the object 
without touching any of the other elements. Then press the Ctrl (Ô on the 
Mac) key and press the up-arrow key once. The element then becomes per-
fectly selected. Drag and drop with the Move tool.
Using the Paste into Selection command
The Paste into Selection command lets you put an image on a separate 
layer while also inserting that image into a selection border. For example, in 
Figure 8-9, we used this command to make it appear as though our surfer is 
in the water.

188
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 8-9: Use the Paste into Selection command to make one element 
appear as though it’s coming out of another element.
You can do the same by following these steps:
 
1. Make your desired selection on the layer in your destination image.
 
 In our figure, we selected the area in the water where the surfer would 
be positioned.
 
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
 
 The image can be within the same file or from another file. Our surfer 
was in another file.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste into 
Selection.
 
 Elements converts the selection border on the layer into a layer mask. 
The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection border. In our 
example, the surfer only shows inside the selected area. His ankles and 
feet are outside the border and therefore are hidden.
Moving a Layer’s Content
Moving the content of a layer is a piece of cake: Grab the Move tool from the 
Tools panel, select your layer on the Layers panel, and drag the element on 
the canvas to your desired location. You can also move the layer in 1-pixel 
increments by using the keyboard arrow keys. Press Shift with the arrows to 
move in 10-pixel increments.

189
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
The Auto-Select Layer option on the Options bar enables you to switch to a 
layer when you click any part of that layer with the Move tool. But be careful 
if you have a lot of overlapping layers because this technique can sometimes 
be more trouble than it’s worth.
The Move tool has a couple of additional options. Here’s the lowdown:
 
✓ Show Bounding Box: This option surrounds the contents of your layer 
with a dotted box that has handles, enabling you to easily transform 
your layer. Find details in the following section.
 
✓ Show Highlight on Rollover: Hover your mouse anywhere over the 
canvas to make an outline appear around the element on your layer. 
Click the highlighted layer to select it and then move it.
 
✓ Arrange menu: This menu enables you to change your selected layer’s 
position in the stacking order.
 
✓ Link Layers: This option, which resides not on the Options bar, but in 
the Layers panel, connects the layers to allow ease in moving (or trans-
forming) multiple layers simultaneously. Select a layer and then Ctrl-click 
(Ô-click on the Mac) to select more layers. Click the Link Layers option.
 
✓ Align menu: Align your selected layers on the left, center, right, top, 
middle, and bottom. As with linking, select your first layer and then 
Shift-click to select more layers. Choose an alignment option.
 
✓ Distribute menu: Use this menu to evenly space your selected layers on 
the left, center, right, top, middle, and bottom. Like with aligning, select 
your first layer and then Shift-click to select more layers. Choose your 
desired distribution option.
Transforming Layers
When working with layers, you may find the need to scale or rotate some 
of your images. You can do so easily by applying the Transform and Free 
Transform commands. The methods to transform layers and transform selec-
tions are identical.
Here’s how to transform a layer:
 
1. Select your desired layer.
 
 You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously 
by linking the layers first.
 
2. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
 
 A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer. Drag a corner 
handle to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging to constrain the 
proportions. To rotate the contents, move the mouse cursor just outside 

190
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
a corner handle until it turns into a curved arrow and then drag. To dis-
tort, skew, or apply perspective to the contents, right-click and choose 
the desired command from the context menu. You can also click the 
rotate, scale, and skew icons in the Options bar, as well as enter your 
transform values numerically in the fields.
 
 If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose 
the individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the 
Image➪Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose Image➪
Rotate.
 
3. When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the 
bounding box.
 
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Each time you 
transform pixels, you put your image through the interpolation process (ana-
lyzing the colors of the original pixels and “manufacturing” new ones). Done 
to the extreme, this process can degrade the quality of your image. This is 
why it’s prudent to use the Free Transform command, rather than individual 
commands — so that all transformations can be executed in one fell swoop.
 
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing a 
command. Select the Show Bounding Box option on the Options bar. This 
option surrounds the layer, or selection, with a box that has handles. Drag 
the handles to transform the layer or selection.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Layers are fun and fantastic, but they can quickly chew up your computer’s 
RAM and bloat your file size. And sometimes, to be honest, having too many 
layers can start to make your file tedious to manage, thereby making you less 
productive. Whenever possible, you should merge your layers to save memory 
and space. Merging combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single 
layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is retained.
In addition, if you need to import your file into another program, certain 
programs don’t support files with layers. Therefore, you may need to flatten 
your file before importing it. Flattening an image combines all visible layers 
into a background, including type, shape, fill, and adjustment layers. You’re 
prompted as to whether you want to discard hidden layers, and any trans-
parent areas are filled with white. We recommend, however, that before you 
flatten your image, you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and 
save it as a native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any 
edits, you have the added flexibility of having your layers.
 
By the way, the only file formats that support layers are native Photoshop 
(.psd); Tagged Image File Format, or TIFF (.tif); and Portable Document 

191
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
Format, or PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements 
automatically flattens your layers into a background. See Chapter 3 for 
details on these file types.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Make certain that all layers you want to retain are visible.
 
 If you have any hidden layers, Elements asks you if you want to discard 
those hidden layers.
 
2. Choose Flatten Image from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu.
 
 All your layers are combined into a single background, as shown in 
Figure 8-10.

192
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 If you mistakenly flatten your image, choose Edit➪Undo or use your 
Undo History panel. (If you’re not familiar with the History panel, see 
Chapter 1 for details.)
Merging layers
You can merge your layers in a couple of ways. Here’s how:
 
✓ Display only those layers you want to merge. Click the eye icon on 
the Layers panel to hide those layers you don’t want to merge. Choose 
Merge Visible from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer menu.
 
✓ Arrange the layers you want to merge so that they’re adjacent to each 
other on the Layers panel. Select the topmost layer of that group and 
choose Merge Down from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu. Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer 
directly below it.

Simple Image Makeovers
In This Chapter
▶ Cropping and straightening your images
▶ Using one-step auto fixes
▶ Editing in Edit Quick mode
▶ Fixing small imperfections
F
ixing images quickly without pain or hassle is probably one of the most 
desirable features you’ll find in Elements and one that we’re sure you’ll 
embrace frequently. Whether you’re an experienced photographer or an ama-
teur shutterbug, cropping away unwanted background, tweaking the lighting 
or color of an image, and erasing away the minor blemishes of a loved one’s 
face are all editing tasks you’ll most likely tackle. With these simple image-
makeover tools in Elements, these tasks are as easy as clicking a 
single button or making a few swipes with a brush.
Cropping and Straightening Images
Cropping a photo is probably one of the easiest 
things you can do to improve the composition of 
your photo. Getting rid of the unnecessary back-
ground around your subject creates a better focal 
point. Another dead giveaway of amateurish pho-
tography is crooked horizon lines. Not a problem. 
Elements gives you several ways to straighten those 
images after the fact. So, after your next photo shoot, 
launch the Elements editor and then crop and straighten 
your images before you show them off. 

194
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most common way to crop a photo is by using the Crop tool. Simple, 
quick, and easy, this tool gets the job done. Here’s how to use it:
 
1. Select the Crop tool from the Tools panel in either Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode.
 
 You can also press the C key. For details on the different workspaces, see 
Chapter 1. For full details on Edit Quick mode, see the section “Editing 
with Edit Quick,” later in this chapter.
 
2. Specify your aspect ratio options on the Options bar.
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size.
 
• Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image when 
you crop.
 
• Preset Sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes. When 
you crop, your image then becomes that specific dimension.
 
 When you crop an image, Elements retains the original resolution 
of the file. Therefore, to keep your image at the same resolution 
while simultaneously eliminating portions of your image, Elements 
must resample the file. Consequently, your image must have suf-
ficient resolution so that the effects of the resampling aren’t too 
noticeable. This is especially true if you’re choosing a larger preset 
size. If all this talk about resolution and resampling is fuzzy, be sure 
to check out Chapter 3.
 
• Width and Height: Enables you to specify a desired width and 
height to crop your image.
 
3. Drag around the portion of the image you want to retain and release 
the mouse button.
 
 When you drag, a crop marquee bounding box appears. Don’t worry if 
your cropping marquee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in Step 4.
 
 The area outside the cropping marquee (called a shield) appears 
darker than the inside in order to better frame your image, as shown 
in Figure 9-1. If you want to change the color and opacity of the 
shield, or if you don’t want it at all, change your Crop preferences by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors. (On the Mac, choose 
Elements➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors.) 
 
4. Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of the crop 
marquee bounding box.
 
 To move the entire marquee, position your mouse inside the marquee 
until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag.

 If you move your mouse outside the marquee, your cursor changes to a 
curved arrow. Drag with this cursor to rotate the marquee. This action 
allows you to both rotate and crop your image simultaneously — handy 
for straightening a crooked image. Just be aware that rotation, unless it’s 
in 90-degree increments, also resamples your image.
 
5. Double-click inside the cropping marquee.
 
 You can also just press Enter or click the green Commit button next to 
the marquee. Elements then discards the area outside the marquee. To 
cancel your crop, click the red Cancel button.

196
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Cropping with a selection border
You can also crop an image by choosing Image➪Crop in either Edit Full or 
Edit Quick mode. First, make a selection with any of the selection tools and 
then choose the command. You can use this technique with any selection 
border shape. That is, your selection doesn’t have to be rectangular. It can be 
round or even freeform. Your cropped image doesn’t take on that shape, but 
Elements crops as close to the boundaries of the selection border as it can. 
For details about making selections, see Chapter 7.
Straightening images
There may be times when you just didn’t quite get that horizon straight when 
you took a photo of the beach. Or maybe you scanned a photo and it wasn’t 
quite centered in the middle of the scanning bed. It’s not a big deal. Elements 
gives you several ways to straighten an image.
Using the Straighten tool
This tool enables you to specify a new straight edge, and it then rotates the 
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
 
1. Select the Straighten tool from the Tools panel (or press the P key) 
only in Edit Full mode.
 
2. Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options on the 
Options bar.
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• Grow or Shrink Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases or 
decreases the size of the canvas to fit the image area.
 
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas outside 
the image area. This choice is helpful if you scan an image and 
white areas appear around your photo that you want removed.
 
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming off any 
background canvas.
 
3. (Optional) Select Rotate All Layers.
 
 If you have an image with layers and you want all of them rotated, select 
this option.
 
4. Draw a line in your image to represent the new straight edge.
 
 Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop 
options in Step 2, also cropped.

197
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to using the Straighten tool, you can straighten your images 
by using two commands on the Image menu, in either Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode:
 
✓ To automatically straighten an image without cropping: Choose Image➪
Rotate➪Straighten Image. This straightening technique leaves the canvas 
around the image.
 
✓ To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously: 
Choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.
Employing One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting-, contrast-, and color-correction tools 
that can improve the appearance of your images with just one menu com-
mand. These commands are available in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, 
and they’re all on the Enhance menu. For more on Edit Quick mode, see the 
section “Editing with Edit Quick,” later in this chapter.
The advantage of these one-step correctors is that they’re extremely easy to 
use. You don’t need to have one iota of knowledge about color or contrast to 
use them. The downside to using them is that sometimes the result isn’t as 
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. And sometimes 
these correctors may even make your image look worse than before by giving 
you weird color shifts. But because these correctors are quick and easy, give 
them a try on an image that needs help. Usually, you don’t want to use more 
than one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your image, undo the fix 
and try another. If you still don’t like the result, move on to one of the manual 
methods we describe in Chapter 10.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command is touted to adjust it all. It’s designed to improve 
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the 
color balance, as shown in Figure 9-2. The overexposed image on the left was 
improved quite nicely with the Auto Smart Fix command.
 
In Windows, the Auto Smart Fix command, as well as the Auto Color, Auto 
Levels, Auto Contrast, Auto Sharpen, and Auto Red Eye Fix, are also available 
in the Organizer (under the Fix pane), where you can apply the commands to 
several selected images simultaneously. 

198
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 9-2: In a hurry? Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image.
If the Auto Smart Fix was just too “auto” for you, you can crank it up a notch 
and try Adjust Smart Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but 
gives you a slider that allows you, not Elements, to control the amount of cor-
rection applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This com-
mand works best on images that have pretty good contrast (even range of tones 
and detail in the shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and need 
just a minor amount of adjustment. Auto Levels works by mapping, or converting, 
the lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and white, thereby making 
highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker, as shown in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.

199
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an 
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t 
improve the contrast, it’s time to bring out the big guns. Try the Levels com-
mand we describe in Chapter 10.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an 
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job of 
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job of 
retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t cause 
the funky colorcasts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. This com-
mand works great on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 9-4.
PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 9-4: The Auto Contrast command works wonders on hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast 
of an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the 
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the amount of black 
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas 
of the image. You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to 
balance the color in your image, as shown in Figure 9-5. Occasionally, this 
command can also be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated 
colors.

200
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 9-5: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a colorcast.
Auto Sharpen
Photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed scanner often 
suffer from a case of overly soft focus. Sharpening gives the illusion of 
increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto Sharpen 
attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 9-6, without overdoing it. 
What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from soft to grainy 
and noisy. Always make sharpening your last fix after you make all your 
other fixes and enhancements. For more precise sharpening, check out the 
Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness features we cover in Chapter 10.
Figure 9-6: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.

201
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Auto Red Eye Fix
This command is self-explanatory. The Auto Red Eye Fix command automati-
cally detects and eliminates red-eye in an image. Red-eye happens when a 
person or animal (where red-eye can also be yellow-, green-, or even blue-
eye) looks directly into the flash.
 
If for some reason the Auto Red Eye Fix doesn’t quite do the trick, you can 
always reach for the Red Eye Removal tool on the Tools panel. Here’s how to 
remove red-eye manually:
 
1. Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your image. 
 
 This one-click tool darkens the pupil while retaining the tonality and tex-
ture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 9-7.
Figure 9-7: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect and destroy dreaded 
red-eye.
 
3. If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options:
 
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the pupil.
 
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the pupil.
 
If you’re trying to fix green-eye (or blue-eye) in animals, your best bet is to 
use the Color Replacement tool. See the section “Replacing One Color with 
Another,” at the end of this chapter.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Editing with Edit Quick
Edit Quick mode is a pared-down version of Edit Full mode that conveniently 
provides basic fixing tools and tosses in a few unique features, such as a 
before-and-after preview of your image.
Here’s a step-by-step workflow that you can follow in Edit Quick mode to 
repair your photos:
 
1. Select one or more photos in the Organizer in Windows (Mac users 
can use Adobe Bridge. See Chapter 2 for more on Bridge), click Fix in 
the upper-right side of the application window, and then click the Edit 
Quick button on the panel below.
 
 Or, if you’re in Edit Full mode, select your desired image(s) from the 
Project Bin and then select the Edit Quick button (the orange button) in 
the upper-right area of the application window.
 
 Note that you can also open images by simply choosing File➪Open.
 
2. Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the application window.
 
 You can choose to view just your original image (Before Only), your 
fixed image (After Only), or both images side by side (Before & After) in 
either portrait (Vertical) or landscape (Horizontal) orientation, as shown 
in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8: Edit Quick mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.

203
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
3. Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your 
image. (See Chapter 5 for more on these tools.)
 
 You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at 
the bottom right of the application window.
 
4. Choose your desired window view by selecting one of the follow-
ing buttons located in the top-left corner of the application window: 
Actual Pixels, Fit Screen, the new Fill Screen (which zooms your 
image to fill your screen), or Print Size.
 
5. Crop your image by using the Crop tool on the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use any of the methods we describe in the “Cropping and 
Straightening Images” section, earlier in this chapter, except for the 
Straighten tool, which is exclusive to Edit Full mode.
 
6. To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or 
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the application window.
 
7. Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels, 
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
 
 All these commands are on the Enhance menu or in the Smart Fix, 
Lighting, Color, and Balance sections on the Quick Fix pane on the right 
side of the application window.
 
 Each of these fixes is described in detail in the section “Employing One-
Step Auto Fixes,” earlier in this chapter. Remember that usually one of the 
fixes is enough. Don’t stack them on top of each other. If one doesn’t work, 
click the Reset button in the top-right of the image preview and try another. 
If you’re not happy, go to Step 8. If you are happy, skip to Step 9.
 
8. If the auto fixes don’t quite cut it, get more control by using the slid-
ers available for Smart Fix, Levels, Contrast, and Color, located in the 
Quick Fix pane on the right of the application window.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
 
• Lighten Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, lightens 
the darker areas of your image without adjusting the highlights.
 
• Darken Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, darkens 
the lighter areas of your image without adjusting the shadows.
 
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values 
and leaves the highlights and shadows as they are.
 
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
 
• Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to 
change the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use 
restraint with this adjustment.
 
• Temperature: Adjusts the colors to make them warmer (red) or 
cooler (blue). This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones

or to correct overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or 
overly warm images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
 
• Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the 
color more green or magenta.
 
 If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more 
manual adjustments that we describe in Chapter 10.
 
 Note that you can also apply fixes to just selected portions of your 
image. Edit Quick mode offers the Quick Selection tool for your selection 
tasks. For details on using this tool, see Chapter 7.
 
9. Add finishing fixes by using the remaining tools in the Tools panel. 
 
 Note: All the tools that were previously located in the Touch Up pane 
have been relocated to the Tools panel. The Touch Up pane is no longer.
 
 Here is a description of each tool:
 
• Red Eye Removal tool: Try the Auto Red Eye Fix to remove red eye 
from your peoples’ eyes. But if it doesn’t work, try using the Red 
Eye Removal tool. This method is described in the section “Auto 
Red Eye Fix,” earlier in this chapter.
 
• Whiten Teeth: This fix does what it says — it whitens teeth. Be sure 
to choose an appropriate brush size from the Brushes drop-down 
panel before whitening. (For more on brush options, see Chapter 
12.) Using a brush diameter that’s larger than the area of the teeth 
also whitens/brightens whatever else it touches — lips, chin, and 
so on. Click the teeth. Note that this tool makes a selection and 
whitens simultaneously. After your initial click, your selection option 
converts from New Selection to Add to Selection in the Options 
bar. If you pick up too much in your dental selection, click the 
Subtract from Selection option and click the area you want to elimi-
nate. When you’re happy with the results of your whitening ses-
sion, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac).
 
• Make Dull Skies Blue: Click or drag over areas of your sky that need 
brightening. Choosing a brush size and selection option is similar 
to using the Whiten Teeth fix, described in the preceding bullet. 
When you click your sky, it is selected and brightened at the same 
time. When you’re done, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D 
(Ô+D on the Mac).
 
• Black and White–High Contrast: This tool converts your image into a 
high-contrast grayscale image. The method and options are similar to 
those for the Whiten Teeth and Make Dull Skies Blue options, described 
in the preceding bullets. Figure 9-9 shows a color image converted into 
a grayscale image that looks like a vintage newspaper photo.
 
 Note that you can find these same fixes (and many more) in Edit Full 
mode, under the Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush tools. Check out 
Chapter 10 for the lowdown on these tools.

10. Finally, sharpen your image either automatically (by clicking the 
Sharpen Auto button under Details in the Quick Fix pane) or manually 
(by dragging the slider on the Sharpen panel).
 
 This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Elements enables you to clone ele-
ments without the hassle of geneti-
cally engineering DNA. In fact, the 
Clone Stamp tool works by just 
taking sampled pixels from one area 
and copying, or cloning, them onto 
another area. The advantage of clon-
ing, rather than making a selection 
and then copying and pasting, is that 
it’s easier to realistically retain soft-
edged elements, such as shadows, as 
shown in Figure 9-10.
The Clone Stamp doesn’t stop there. 
You can also use this tool for fixing 
flaws, such as scratches, bruises, 
date/time stamp imprints from cam-
eras and other minor imperfections. 
Although the birth of the healing

to realistically duplicate soft-edged elements, 
such as shadows.

206
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
tools (discussed in the following sections) has somewhat pushed the Clone 
Stamp tool out of the retouching arena, it can still do a good repair job in 
many instances.
Here’s how to use the Clone Stamp tool:
 
1. Choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
2. On the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down 
list, and then use the brush as-is or adjust its size with the Size slider.
 
 Keep in mind that the size of the brush you specify should be appropri-
ate for what you’re trying to clone or retouch. If you’re cloning a large 
object, use a large brush. For repairing small flaws, use a small brush. 
Cloning with a soft-edged brush usually produces more natural results. 
For details on brushes, see Chapter 12.
 
3. Choose your desired Blend Mode and Opacity percentage.
 
 For more on blend modes, see Chapter 11. To make your cloned image 
appear ghosted, use an opacity percentage of less than 100 percent.
 
4. Select or deselect the Aligned option.
 
 With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your 
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from 
the same location, leave the Aligned option deselected.
 
5. Select or deselect the Sample All Layers option.
 
 This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible layers for the 
clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone Stamp tool clones from only 
the active layer. Check out Chapter 8 for details about working with 
layers.
 
6. Click the double rectangle icon if you want to display an overlay. 
 
 Displaying an overlay can be helpful, when what you are cloning needs 
to be in alignment with the underlying image. Adjust the opacity for 
your overlay. If you select Auto Hide, when you release your mouse, 
you will see a ghosted preview of how your cloned pixels will appear on 
the image. While you are cloning, however, the overlay is hidden. Select 
Clipped to have the overlay contained only within the boundaries of 
your brush. We think that this makes it easier to more precisely clone 
what you want. Finally, select Invert to reverse the colors and tones in 
your overlay.
 
7. Alt-click (Option-click on the Macintosh) the area of your image that 
you want to clone to define the source of the clone.

207
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
8. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to 
appear, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 While you drag, Elements displays a crosshair cursor along 
with your Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair is the source 
you’re cloning from, and the Clone Stamp cursor is where 
the clone is being applied. While you move the mouse, the 
crosshair moves, as well, so you have a continuous reference 
to the area of your image that you’re cloning. Watch the 
crosshair, or else you may clone something you don’t want.
 
If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your 
mouse. Also, when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. 
One or two clicks on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-
handed with the Clone Stamp, you get a blotchy effect that’s a 
telltale sign something has been retouched.
Retouching with the Healing Brush
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool in 
that you clone pixels from one area onto another area. But the 
Healing Brush is superior in that it takes into account the tonal-
ity (highlights, midtones, and shadows) of the flawed area. The Healing Brush 
clones by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then using 
the colors around the brush stroke while you paint over the flawed area (the 
destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadow areas remain intact, giving 
you a realistic and natural repair that isn’t as blotchy or miscolored as the 
repair you get with the Clone Stamp tool.
Here are the steps to heal a photo:
 
1. Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush 
tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
 You can also heal between two images, but be sure that they have the same 
color mode: for example, both RGB (red, green, blue). We chose a guy who 
looks like he might like to lose a few years, as shown in Figure 9-12.
 
2. Specify a diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the Brush 
Picker drop-down panel on the Options bar.
 
 You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on 
these options, see Chapter 12. Don’t be shy. Be sure to adjust the size 
of your brush, as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw 
you’re retouching is critical to creating a realistic effect.

PhotoSpin
Figure 9-12: Wipe out ten years in two minutes with the Healing Brush tool.
 
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
 
 For most retouching jobs, you probably should leave the mode as 
Normal. Replace mode preserves textures, such as noise or film grain, 
around the edges of your strokes.
 
4. Choose one of these Source options:
 
• Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. You use this option for 
the majority of your repairs.
 
• Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern chosen from the Pattern Picker 
drop-down panel.
 
5. Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
 
 For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave Aligned selected. 
Here are the details on each option:
 
• With Aligned selected: When you click or drag with the Healing Brush, 
Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor. 
The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as the 
source. When you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also 
moves, providing a constant reference to the area you’re sampling.
 
• With Aligned deselected: Elements applies the source pixels from 
your initial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop 
and start dragging.

209
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
6. Select the Sample All Layers option to heal an image by using all 
visible layers.
 
 If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
 
 To ensure maximum editing flexibility later, select the Sample All Layers 
option and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. 
When you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on 
the image itself; so, you can adjust opacity and blend modes and make 
other adjustments to the healed layer.
 
7. Establish the sampling point by Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac).
  
 Make sure to click the area of your image that you want to clone from. In 
our example, we clicked a smooth area of the forehead.
 
8. Release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click or drag over a 
flawed area of your image.
 
 Keep an eye on the crosshair because that’s the area you’re healing 
from. We brushed over the wrinkles under and around the eyes and on 
the forehead. (Refer to Figure 9-12.) This guy never looked so good, and 
he experienced absolutely no recovery time.
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot 
Healing Brush is great for smaller imperfections. The Spot Healing Brush 
doesn’t require you to specify a sampling source. It automatically takes a 
sample from around the area to be retouched. It’s quick, easy, and often effec-
tive. But it doesn’t give you control over the sampling source, so keep an eye 
out for less-than-desirable fixes.
Here’s how to quickly fix small flaws with the Spot Healing Brush tool:
 
1. Open your image and grab the Spot Healing Brush tool in Edit Full mode.
 
 The moles on this guy’s face, as shown in Figure 9-13, are no match for 
the Spot Healing Brush.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select a desired 
diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the drop-down panel.
 
 Select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you’re fixing.
 
3. Choose a blend mode from the Options bar.
 
 As with the Healing Brush, the most likely mode is Normal.

PhotoSpin
Figure 9-13: Now you see it (left), and now you don’t (right).
 
4. Choose a Type from the Options bar:
 
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selec-
tion to fix the flawed area.
 
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a tex-
ture to fix the flaw.
 
 Try Proximity Match first, and if it doesn’t work, undo it and try Create 
Texture.
 
5. Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image by using all visible layers.
 
 If you leave this check box deselected, you heal from only the active 
layer.
 
6. Click or drag the area you want to fix.
 
 We clicked the moles with the Spot Healing Brush. For the wrinkles 
around the eyes, we broke out the Healing Brush. We needed more con-
trol of the sampling source to achieve realistic results.

 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
The techniques of dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where 
photographers fixed negatives that had overly dark or light areas by adding 
or subtracting exposure, using holes and paddles as an enlarger made prints. 
The Dodge and Burn tools are even better than their analog ancestors because 
they’re more flexible and much more precise. You can specify the size and 
softness of your tool by simply selecting from one of the many brush tips. 
You can also limit the correction to various tonal ranges in your image — 
shadows, midtones, or highlights. Finally, you can adjust the amount of cor-
rection that’s applied by specifying an exposure percentage.
 
Use these tools only on small areas, such as the girl’s face shown in Figure 9-14, 
and in moderation. You can even make a selection prior to dodging and burn-
ing to ensure that the adjustment is only applied to your specific area. Also, 
keep in mind that you can’t add detail that isn’t there to begin with. If you 
try to lighten extremely dark shadows that contain little detail, you get gray 
areas. If you try to darken overly light highlights, you just end up with white 
blobs.
Figure 9-14: Use the Dodge and Burn tools to lighten and darken small areas.

212
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Follow these steps to dodge or burn an image:
 
1. Choose either the Dodge (to lighten) or Burn (to darken) tool from the 
Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
 Press Shift+O to cycle through the Dodge, Burn, and Sponge tools.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel and also 
adjust the brush size, if necessary.
 
 Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging or burning effect over a larger 
area, making blending with the surrounding area easier.
 
3. From the Range pop-up list, select Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
 
 Select Shadows to darken or lighten the darker areas of your image. 
Select Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. Select 
Highlights to make the light areas lighter or darker.
 
 In Figure 9-14, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged 
the shadows.
 
4. Choose the amount of correction you want to apply with each stroke 
by adjusting the Exposure setting on the Options bar.
 
 Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount of darkening 
or lightening. Exposure is similar to the opacity setting that you use with 
the regular Brush tool. We used a setting of 10 percent.
 
5. Paint over the areas you want to lighten or darken.
 
 If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo.
Smudging Away Rough Spots
The Smudge tool, one of the focus tools, pushes your pixels around using the 
color that’s under the cursor when you start to drag. Think of it as dragging 
a brush through wet paint. You can use this tool to create a variety of effects. 
When it’s used to the extreme, you can create a warped effect. When it’s used 
more subtly, you can soften the edges of objects in a more natural fashion 
than you can with the Blur tool. Or you can create images that take on a 
painterly effect, as shown in Figure 9-15. Keep an eye on your image while you 
paint, however, because you can start to eliminate detail and wreak havoc if 
you’re not careful with the Smudge tool.
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Smudge tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
 Press Shift+R to cycle through the Smudge, Blur, and Sharpen tools.

213
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-15: The Smudge tool can make your images appear to be painted.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brushes Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
 Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger 
brushes produce more extreme effects.
 
3. Select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up list.
 
4. Choose the strength of the smudging effect with the Strength slider or 
text box.
 
 The lower the value, the lighter the effect.
 
5. If your image has multiple layers, select Sample All Layers to make 
Elements use pixels from all the visible layers when it produces the 
effect.
 
 The smudge still appears on only the active layer, but the look is a bit 
different, depending on the colors of the underlying layers.
 
6. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore-
ground color.
 
 Rather than use the color under your cursor, this option smears your 
foreground color at the start of each stroke. If you want the best of both 
worlds, you can quickly switch into Finger Painting mode by pressing 
the Alt key while you drag. Release Alt to go back to Normal mode.

214
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
7. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
 
 Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change 
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) 
to undo the changes and then lower the Strength percentage (discussed 
in Step 4) even more.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used for both repair and more artistic endeavors. You 
can use the Blur tool to soften a small flaw or part of a rough edge. You can 
add a little blur to an element to make it appear as though it was moving 
when photographed. You can also blur portions of your image to emphasize 
the focal point, as shown in Figure 9-16, where we blurred everything except 
the girl’s face. The Blur tool works by decreasing the contrast among adja-
cent pixels in the blurred area.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and its options are similar to those of 
the Smudge tool, as we describe in the preceding section. When you use the 
Blur tool, be sure to use a small brush for smaller areas of blur.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-16: The Blur tool can be used to emphasize a focal point.

215
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
If the Blur tool is yin, the Sharpen tool is yang. The Sharpen tool increases the 
contrast among adjacent pixels to give the illusion that things are sharper. 
This tool needs to be used with restraint, however. Sharpen can quickly give 
way to overly grainy and noisy images if you’re not cautious.
Use a light hand and keep the areas 
you sharpen small. Sometimes, the 
eyes in a soft portrait can benefit 
from a little sharpening, as shown 
in Figure 9-17. You can also slightly 
sharpen an area to emphasize it 
against a less-than-sharp background.
 
To use the Sharpen tool, grab the 
tool from the Tools panel and follow 
the steps provided for the Smudge 
tool in the section “Smudging Away 
Rough Spots,” earlier in this chapter. 
In addition, here are some tips for 
using the Sharpen tool:
 
✓ Use a low value, around 25 per-
cent or less.
 
✓ Remember that you want to 
gradually sharpen your element 
to avoid the nasty, noisy grain 
that can occur from oversharpening.
 
✓ Because sharpening increases contrast, if you use other contrast adjust-
ments, such as Levels, you boost the contrast of the sharpened area 
even more.
 
If you need to sharpen your overall image, try choosing either Enhance➪
Unsharp Mask or Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness instead. These features offer 
more options and better control.
Sponging Color On and Off
The Sponge tool soaks up color or squeezes it out. In more technical terms, 
this tool reduces or increases the intensity, or saturation, of color in both 
color and grayscale images. Yes, the Sponge tool also works in Grayscale 
mode by darkening or lightening the brightness value of those pixels.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-17: Reserve the Sharpen tool for small 
areas, such as eyes.

216
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Like with the Blur and Sharpen tools, you can use the Sponge tool to reduce 
or increase the saturation in selected areas in order to draw attention to or 
away from those areas.
Follow these steps to sponge color on or off your image:
 
1. Choose the Sponge tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
 Press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge, and Burn tools.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brushes Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
 Use large, soft brushes to saturate or desaturate a larger area.
 
3. Choose either Desaturate or Saturate from the Mode pop-up list to 
decrease or increase color intensity, respectively.
 
4. Choose a flow rate with the Flow slider or text box.
 
 The flow rate is the speed with which the saturation or desaturation 
effect builds while you paint.
 
5. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with 
color.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 9-18, we saturated one of the women to 
make her more of a focal point and desaturated the others.

 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Replacing One Color with Another
The Color Replacement tool allows 
you to replace the original color of 
an image with the foreground color. 
You can use this tool in a multitude 
of ways:
 
✓ Colorize a grayscale image 
to create the look of a hand-
painted photo.
 
✓ Completely change the color of 
an element, or elements, in your 
image, as shown in Figure 9-19.
 
✓ Eliminate red-eye (or yellow-eye 
in animals) if other, more auto-
mated methods don’t work to 
your satisfaction.
What we particularly like about the 
Color Replacement tool is that it preserves all the tones in the image. The 
color that’s applied isn’t like the opaque paint that’s applied when you paint 
with the Brush tool. When you’re replacing color, the midtones, shadows, and 
highlights are retained. The Color Replacement tool works by first sampling 
the original colors in the image and then replacing those colors with the fore-
ground color. By specifying different sampling methods, limits, and tolerance 
settings, you can control the range of colors that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
 
1. Select the Color Replacement tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
 
 This tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools. Press 
Shift+B to cycle through the tools.
 
2. Specify your desired brush tip diameter and hardness from the Brush 
Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
 
 Here’s a brief rundown of each one:
 
• Color: The default, this mode works well for most jobs. This mode 
works great for eliminating red-eye.
 
• Hue: Similar to color, this mode is less intense and provides a 
subtler effect.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-19: The Color Replacement tool 
replaces the color in your image with the 
foreground color.

218
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
• Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert the color in 
your image to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black on the 
Tools panel.
 
• Luminosity: This mode, the opposite of Color, doesn’t provide 
much of an effect.
 
4. Choose your Sampling method (represented by the icons):
 
• Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously while you 
drag your mouse.
 
• Once: Replaces colors only in areas that contain the color you first 
sampled when you initially clicked.
 
• Background Swatch: Replaces colors only in areas containing your 
current background color.
 
5. Select your Limits mode.
 
 You have these options:
 
• Contiguous: Replaces the color of adjacent pixels containing the 
sampled color.
 
• Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the sam-
pled color, whether or not they’re adjacent.
 
6. Set your Tolerance percentage.
 
 Tolerance refers to a range of color. The higher the value, the broader 
the range of color that’s sampled, and vice versa.
 
7. Select the Anti-alias option.
 
 Anti-aliasing slightly softens the edges of the sampled areas.
 
8. Click or drag your image.
 
 The foreground color replaces the original colors of the sampled areas. 
In our example (refer to Figure 9-19), we used a black foreground color.
 
If you want to be very precise, make a selection before you replace your 
color. We did this with the girl in our figure so we could avoid “coloring out-
side the lines.”

f you’ve tried the quick and easy automatic fixes 
on your images and they didn’t quite do the job, 
you’ve come to the right place. The great thing 
about Elements is that it offers multiple ways and 
multiple levels of repairing and enhancing your 
images. If an auto fix doesn’t cut it, move on to a 
manual fix. If you’re still not happy, you can con-
sider shooting in Camera Raw format, as long as your 
camera can do so. Elements has wonderful Camera 
Raw support, enabling you to process your images to 
your exact specifications (as we explain in Chapter 4). 
Chances are that if you can’t find the tools to correct and 
repair your images in Elements, those images are probably beyond salvaging.

220
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
With information in Chapter 9 (where we explain those quick fixes) and this 
chapter at your fingertips, try to employ some kind of logical workflow when 
you tackle the correction and repair of your images, such as in these steps:
 
1. Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if necessary.
 
2. After you have the images in their proper physical state, correct the 
lighting and establish good tonal range for your shadows, highlights, 
and midtones in order to display the greatest detail possible.
 
 Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor color problems. If not, 
move on to adjusting the color balance.
 
3. Eliminate any colorcasts and adjust the saturation, if necessary.
 
4. Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters, to 
retouch any flaws.
 
5. Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clarity and 
sharpness.
 
6. Apply any enhancements or special effects, if so desired.
 
 By following these steps and allocating a few minutes of your time, you 
should be able to get all your images in shape to print, post, and share 
with family and friends.
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the 
Auto tools that we describe in Chapter 9 didn’t work or were just too, well, 
automatic for you. You’ll find that the manual tools offer more control over 
adjusting overall contrast, as well as bringing out details in shadow, mid-
tones, and highlight areas of your images. Note that all lighting adjustments 
can be found in both Edit Full and Edit Quick modes.
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick and easy method of cor-
recting over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well 
with images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back 
(backlit). These images usually suffer from having the subject partially 
or completely surrounded in shadows, such as the original image (left) in 
Figure 10-1.

Shadows/Highlights command
Figure 10-1: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/Highlights adjustment.
To use the Shadows/Highlights adjustment, follow these steps:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Shadows/Highlights and make sure the Preview check box is selected.
 
 When the dialog box appears, the default correction is automatically 
applied in your preview.
 
2. If the default adjustment doesn’t quite do the job, move the sliders (or 
enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your shadows (dark 
areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones (middle-toned areas).
 
 Remember that you want to try to reveal more detail in the dark and 
light areas of your image. If, after you do so, your image still looks like it 
needs more correction, add or delete contrast in your midtone areas.
 
3. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
 
 If you want to start over, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the 
Reset button (previously the Cancel button).

Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its aptly descriptive moniker, the Brightness/Contrast command 
doesn’t do a great job of brightening (making an image darker or lighter) 
or adding or deleting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this com-
mand because of its appropriate name and ease of use. But after users real-
ize its limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls, such as 
Shadows/Highlights and Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the 
adjustment equally to all areas of your image. For example, a photo’s high-
lights may need darkening, but all the midtones and shadows are perfect. The 
Brightness slider isn’t smart enough to recognize that, so when you darken 
the highlights in your image, the midtones and shadows also become darker. 
To compensate for the unwanted darkening, you try to adjust the Contrast, 
which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select 
only the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 10-2. (For 
more on selections, see Chapter 7.) After you make your selection, choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast.
Figure 10-2: The Brightness/Contrast adjustment is best reserved for correcting selected areas 
(left) rather than the entire image (right).
Pinpointing proper contrast with Levels
If you want real horsepower when it comes to correcting the brightness and 
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels 
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than what you find 
with the other lighting and color adjustment commands, but when you under-
stand how it works, it can be downright user-friendly.
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, detailed 
in Chapter 9. The Levels command, its manual cousin, offers much more 

223
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
control. And unlike the primitive Brightness/Contrast control, Levels enables 
you to darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that Levels can 
be used on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. You can also 
apply the Levels command by using an adjustment layer, as we describe in 
Chapter 8.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you 
want to figure out how to use. Here’s how it works:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels.
 
 We recommend using Edit Full mode for this command, where you’ll 
have access to the Info panel in Step 2.
 
 The Levels dialog box appears, displaying a histogram. This graph dis-
plays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256 avail-
able brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the histo-
gram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right. Note 
that, in addition to viewing the histogram of the composite RGB channel 
(the entire image), you can view the histogram of just the Red, Green, or 
Blue channel by selecting one of them from the Channel drop-down list.
 
 Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using 
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s 
component color channels by selecting the specific channel from the 
Channel pop-up menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected 
areas, which can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting 
and others don’t.
 
2. In Edit Full mode, choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
 
3. Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in 
the dialog box; first select the White Eyedropper tool and then move 
the cursor over the image.
 
4. Look at the Info panel, try to find the lightest white in the image, and 
then select that point by clicking it.
 
 The lightest white has the highest RGB values.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to 
find the darkest black in the image.
 
 The darkest black has the lowest RGB values.
 
 When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels 
are redistributed between those two points.
 
 You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position 
of the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just below the his-
togram). Or you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three 
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use 
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.

224
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
6. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts by selecting a 
neutral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info panel shows 
equal values of red, green, and blue.
 
 If your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper tool.
 
 If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a 
colorcast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu 
and doing one of the following:
 
• Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add cyan or to the left to add red.
 
• Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right 
to add magenta or to the left to add green.
 
• Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right 
to add yellow or to the left to add blue.
 
7. If your image requires it, adjust the output sliders at the bottom of the 
Levels dialog box.
 
 Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces 
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
 
8. Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input 
slider.
 
 The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to lighten 
midtones and drag to the right to darken them. You can also enter a value.
 
9. Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
 
 Your image should be greatly improved, as shown in Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3: Improve the contrast of an image with the intelligent Levels command.

225
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as 
the Auto Levels command, as we explain in Chapter 9. Note the changes and 
subsequent pixel redistribution made to the histogram after you click this 
button.
Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want can seem about as attainable as winning the state 
lottery. Sometimes, an unexpected colorcast (a shift in color) can be avoided 
at the shooting stage, for example, by using (or not using, in some cases) a 
flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually do a pretty good job of cor-
recting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments. Occasionally, 
you may want to change the color of your image to create a special effect. 
Conversely, you also may want to strip out an image’s color altogether to 
create a vintage feel. Remember that all these color adjustments can be 
applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just a selection. Whatever your 
color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
All color adjustments can be found in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, 
except for Defringe Layers, which is reserved for Edit Full mode only.
 
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix 
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files 
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color 
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Chapter 4.
Removing colorcasts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom and got a funky green tinge 
in your image, it was probably the result of the overhead fluorescent lighting. 
To eliminate this green colorcast, you can apply the Remove Color Cast com-
mand. This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color and remove 
the cast.
Follow these short steps to correct your image:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Edit Full 
or Edit Quick mode.
 
 The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to 
better view your image. Note that this command is also available in 
Guided mode.

226
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
2. Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral 
gray, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
 
Figure 10-4: Get rid of nasty color shifts with the Remove Color Cast command.
 
 In our example, we clicked the sky in the image on the left.
 
 The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose. 
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject 
matter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely 
a preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK. If you goof up, 
click the Reset button, and your image reverts to its unadjusted state.
 
3. If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close 
the dialog box.
 
If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t cut it, try using the Color 
Variation commands or applying a photo filter (as we describe in the section 
“Adjusting color temperature with photo filters,” later in this chapter). For 
example, if your photo has too much green, try applying a magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image 
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image. 
Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And lightness controls 
the brightness value.
Follow these steps to adjust color by using the Hue/Saturation command:
 
1. In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure to select the Preview 
check box so that you can view your adjustments. Note that this com-
mand is also available in Guided mode.

227
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
2. Select all the colors (Master) from the Edit drop-down list or choose 
one color to adjust.
 
3. Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust 
the colors as described:
 
• Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclock-
wise (drag left) around the color wheel.
 
• Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich-
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives 
you the appearance of a grayscale image.
 
• Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag 
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
 
 The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors in 
their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The lower 
color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
 
 When you select an individual 
color to adjust, sliders appear 
between the color bars so that 
you can define the range of 
color to be adjusted. You can 
select, add, or subtract colors 
from the range by choosing one 
of the Eyedropper tools and 
clicking in the image.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box 
also lets you colorize images, a 
useful option for creating sepia-
colored images.
 
4. (Optional) Check the Colorize 
option to change the colors in 
your image to a new, single 
color. Drag the Hue slider 
to change the color to your 
desired hue.
 
 The pure white and black pixels 
remain unchanged, and the inter-
mediate gray pixels are colorized.
 
Use the Hue/Saturation command, 
with the Colorize option, to create 
tinted photos, such as the one shown 
in Figure 10-5. You can also make 
selections in a grayscale image and apply a different tint to each selection. This 
can be especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create vintage or moody 
feels, and they can transform even mediocre photos into something special.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter 
about color, we realize that there 
may be times when you don’t want 
any color. With the Remove Color 
command, you can easily eliminate 
all the color from an image, layer, 
or selection. In Figure 10-6, we 
made a selection on the right side 
of the image and applied the Remove 
Color command. To use this one-
step command, simply choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove 
Color.
 
Sometimes, stripping away color 
with this command can leave your 
image flat, or low in contrast. If this 
is the case, adjust the contrast by 
using one of Element’s many light-
ing fixes, such as Auto Levels, Auto 
Contrast, or Levels.
The Enhance➪Convert to Black and White command enables you to convert 
a selection, a layer, or an entire image to grayscale. But, rather than just arbi-
trarily strip color like the Remove Color command does, the Convert to Black 
and White command enables you to select a conversion method by first 
choosing an image style. To further tweak the results, you can add or sub-
tract colors (Red, Green, or Blue) or contrast by moving the Intensity sliders 
until your grayscale image looks the way you want. Note that you aren’t really 
adding color; you’re simply altering the amount of data in the color channels. 
For more information on channels, see Chapter 2.
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors 
in your image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to 
replace by creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white 
(selected), black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. See 
Chapter 8 for more details on masks. You can then adjust the hue and/or 
saturation of those selected colors.

 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
Follow these steps to get on your way to replacing color:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Replace Color.
 
 The Replace Color dialog box appears. Make sure to select the Preview 
check box.
 
2. Choose either Selection or Image:
 
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview area. The deselected 
areas are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected 
areas are white.
 
• Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview area.
 
3. Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview 
area.
 
4. Shift-click or use the plus sign (+) Eyedropper tool to add more colors.
 
5. Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key or use the minus sign (–) 
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
 
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider to 
fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection based 
on the Fuzziness value.
 
 If you can’t quite get the selection you want with the Fuzziness slider, try 
selecting the new Localized Color Clusters option. This option enables 
you to select multiple color clusters and can assist in getting a cleaner, 
more precise selection, especially when trying to select more than one 
color.
 
7. Move the Hue and/or Saturation sliders to change the color or color 
richness, respectively. Move the Lightness slider to lighten or darken 
the image.
 
 Be careful to use a light hand (no pun intended) with the Lightness 
slider. You can reduce the tonal range too much and end up with a mess.
 
8. View the result in the image window.
 
9. If you’re satisfied, click OK to apply the settings and close the 
dialog box.

Correcting with Color Curves
Elements borrowed a much-used feature from Photoshop named Curves. 
However, it added the word Color and took away some of its sophistication. 
Nevertheless, the Color Curves adjustment attempts to improve the tonal 
range in color images by making adjustments to highlights, shadows, and 
midtones in each color channel. (For more on channels, see Chapter 2.) Try 
using this command on images in which the foreground elements appear 
overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is also designed 
to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.
Here’s how to use this great adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire image:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Color Curves.
 
 The Adjust Color Curves dialog box appears. Make sure to select the 
Preview check box. Move the dialog box to the side so that you can view 
the image window while making adjustments.
 
2. Various curve adjustments appear in the Select a Style area. Select a 
style to make your desired adjustments while viewing your image in 
the After window.
 
3. If you need greater precision, use the highlight, brightness, contrast, 
and shadow adjustment sliders, as shown in Figure 10-8, and then 
adjust the sliders as desired.
 
 The graph on the left represents the distribution of tones in your image. 
When you first access the Color Curves dialog box, the tonal range of 
your image is represented by a straight line. While you drag the sliders, 
the straight line is altered, and the tonal range is adjusted accordingly.
 
4. Click OK when you’ve adjusted the image satisfactorily.
 
5. To start over, click the Reset button.

Adjusting skin tones
Occasionally, you may find that the loved ones in your photos have taken on 
a rather sickly shade of green, red, or some other non-flesh-colored tone. To 
rectify that problem, Elements has a command specifically designed to adjust 
the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to a natural shade.
Here’s how to use this feature:
 
1. Open your image in Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, select the Preview 
check box, and do one or both of the following:
 
• Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any 
layers, your entire image is adjusted.
 
• Select the areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the selected 
areas are adjusted. This is a good way to go if you’re happy with 
the color of your other elements and just want to tweak the skin 
tones. For more on selection techniques, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
 
 The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears. This command is 
also found in Guided mode.
 
3. In the image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected.
 
 The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in 
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected 
in Step 1.
 
4. If you’re not satisfied with the results, click another area or fiddle 
with the Skin and Ambient Light sliders:
 
• Tan: Adds or removes the amount of brown in the skin.
 
• Blush: Adds or removes the amount of red in the skin.
 
• Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it 
warmer (right toward red) or cooler (left toward blue).
 
5. When you’re happy with the correction, click OK to apply the adjust-
ment and close the dialog box.
 
 The newly toned skin appears, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
 To start anew, click the Reset button. And, of course, to bail out com-
pletely, click Cancel.

Defringing layers
A telltale sign of haphazardly com-
posited images is selections with 
fringe. We don’t mean the cute kind 
hanging from your leather jacket or 
upholstery; we mean the unattractive 
kind that consists of background 
pixels that surround the edges of 
your selections, as shown in 
Figure 10-11. 
Inevitably, when you move or paste 
a selection, some background pixels 
are bound to go along for the ride. 
These pixels are referred to as a fringe or halo. Luckily, the Defringe com-
mand replaces the color of the fringe pixels with the colors of neighboring 
pixels that don’t contain the background color. In our example, we plucked 
the toy boat out of a white studio background and placed it on an image of 
water. Some of the background pixels were included in our selection and 
appear as a white fringe. When we apply the Defringe command, those white 
fringe pixels are changed to colors of nearby pixels, such as blue or red, as 
shown in Figure 10-11.

Follow these steps to defringe your selection:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, copy and paste a selection onto a new 
or existing layer, or drag and drop a selection onto a new document.
 
 For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
 
 The Defringe dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a value for the number of pixels that needs to be converted.
 
 Try entering 1 or 2 first to see whether that does the trick. If not, you 
may need to enter a slightly higher value.
 
4. Click OK to accept the value and close the dialog box.
Correcting with Color Variations
Although we give you several ways in this chapter to eliminate colorcasts 
in an image, here’s one more. The Variations command is a digital color-
correction feature that’s been around for years and is largely unchanged. 
That’s probably because it’s one of those great features that’s easy to use and 
easy to understand, and it works. The command enables you to make cor-
rections by visually comparing thumbnails of color variations of your image. 
You may use this command when you’re not quite sure what’s wrong with the 
color or what kind of colorcast your image has.
Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode.
 
 The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your 
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in 
Figure 10-12.
 
2. Select a tonal range or color richness (if you’re unsure which range to 
select, start with the Midtones):
 
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light 
areas in the image, respectively.
 
• Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors 
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your 
image is faded from time, be sure to increase the saturation after 
you correct any colorcast issues.
 
 Usually, just correcting the midtones is enough to get your image’s color 
in order, but if it’s not, you can always adjust the shadows and high-
lights, as well.

increase the amount.
 
4. If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust the 
color by clicking the various Increase or Decrease Color buttons.
 
 Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to cor-
rect the problem.
 
 Be sure to keep an eye on the After thumbnail, which reflects your cor-
rections while you make them.
 
5. Click the Darken or Lighten buttons to make the colors a little darker 
or lighter, respectively.
 
6. If you selected Saturation in Step 2, click the Less Saturation or More 
Saturation buttons.
 
7. If you make a mistake — or several mistakes, for that matter — click 
the Undo button.
 
 The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you 
botch something, you can always click the Reset Image button to start 
again. Keep in mind that you can’t undo the Reset Image command after 
you click it. Click Cancel to bail entirely.
 
8. To apply your color adjustments and close the dialog box, click OK.

236
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
The Color Variations command is a great tool to correct those old, faded, 
green- (or some other unwanted color) tinted circa yesteryear photos. Color 
Variations allows you to easily correct the color and saturation of these pre-
cious, but damaged, images. Remember to either decrease the offending 
color or add the color that’s the opposite of the cast in the image. If it’s too 
red, add cyan and vice versa.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color tem-
perature of light makes an image blue. Conversely, an image shot in a lower 
color temperature makes a photo yellow. In the old days, photographers 
used to place colored glass filters in front of their camera lenses to adjust the 
color temperature of the light. They did this to either warm up or cool down 
photos, or to just add a hint of color for subtle special effects. Elements gives 
you the digital version of these filters with the Photo Filter command.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
 
1. In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter.
 
 The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
 
 Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by 
creating a photo-filter adjustment layer. For details, see Chapter 8.
 
2. In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the 
drop-down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the 
Color Picker.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
 
• Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjust the white balance in an 
image to make the colors warmer, or more yellow. Filter (81) is like 
(85) and (LBA), but it’s best used for minor adjustments. 
 
• Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjust the white balance 
that’s shown, but instead of making the colors warmer, they make 
the colors cooler, or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80) and (LBB), but it’s 
designed for slight adjustments.
 
• Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the 
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a 
colorcast or to apply a special effect.
 
3. Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to 
your image.

237
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
4. Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening 
your image.
 
5. Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.
 
One one way to minimize the need for color adjustments is to be sure and 
set your camera’s white balance for your existing lighting conditions before 
shooting your photo.
Mapping your colors
Elements provides color mapper commands that change the colors in your 
image by mapping them to other values. You find the color mappers on the 
Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 10-13 shows an example of each com-
mand, all of which are also briefly described in the following sections.
Equalize
Gradient Map
Threshold
Posterize
Invert
Figure 10-13: Change the colors in your image by remapping them to other values.

238
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Equalize
This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and 
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remaining 
pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your indi-
vidual image.
Gradient Map
This command maps the tonal range of an image to the colors of your chosen 
gradient. For example, colors (such as orange, green, and purple) are mapped 
to the shadow, highlight, and midtone areas.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega-
tive. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their complementary 
hues. (Blue goes to yellow, red goes to cyan, and so on.)
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value 
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster look, 
and higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.
Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are brighter 
than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that are darker 
than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to achieve differ-
ent high-contrast effects.
Adjusting Clarity
After your image has the right contrast and color, and you fix any flaws (as 
we describe in Chapter 9), you’re ready to work on the overall clarity of 
that image. Although you may have fixed the nitpicky little blemishes with 
the healing tools, if your image suffers from an overall problem, like dust, 
scratches, or artifacts (blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the 
help of a filter. After you totally clean up your image, your last chore is to 
give it a good sharpening. Why wait until the bitter end to do so? Sometimes, 
while you’re improving the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws, you 
can reduce the clarity and sharpness of an image. So, you want to be sure 
that your image is as soft as it’s going to get before you tackle your sharpen-
ing tasks. On the other hand, also be aware that sharpening increases con-
trast, so depending on how much of your image you’re sharpening, you may 

239
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
need to go back and fine-tune it by using the lighting adjustments described 
in the section “Adjusting Lighting,” earlier in this chapter.
Finally, with all this talk about sharpening, we know that you may find it 
strange when we say that you may also need to occasionally blur your image. 
Blurring can be done to eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during 
scanning, soften distracting backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even 
to create the illusion of motion.
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
Surprisingly, the tools you want to use to eliminate junk from your images 
are found on the Filter➪Noise submenu in Edit Full or Edit Quick mode. With 
the exception of the Add Noise filter, the others help to hide noise, dust, 
scratches, and artifacts. Here’s the list of junk removers:
 
✓ Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make 
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blurring 
of your image (that’s what’s hiding the junk), but hopefully the edges are 
still sharp.
 
✓ Dust & Scratches: Like its name says, hides dust and scratches by blurring 
those areas of your image that contain the nastiness. (It looks for harsh 
transitions in tone.) Specify your desired Radius value, which is the size of 
the area to be blurred. Also, specify the Threshold value, which determines 
how much contrast between pixels must be present before they’re blurred.
 
 Use this filter with restraint because it can obliterate detail and make 
your image go from bad to worse.
 
✓ Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter 
goes through is rather technical, so suffice it to say that the light spots 
darken, the dark spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed. 
Specify your desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
 
✓ Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from 
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the left) 
in Figure 10-14. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look 
overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in your image:
 
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
 
• Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details 
but reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
 
• Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
 
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur 
from low-quality JPEG compression.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 10-14: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts.
Blurring when you need to
It may sound odd that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image. 
But, if your photo is overly grainy or suffers from a nasty moiré (wavy) pat-
tern (described in the following list), you may need to blur the image to cor-
rect the problem. And often, you may even want to blur the background of 
an image to deemphasize distractions, or to make the foreground elements 
appear sharper and provide a better focal point.
All the blurring tools are found on the Filter➪Blur menu in Edit Full or 
Edit Quick mode, with the exception of the Blur tool, which is explained in 
Chapter 9:
 
✓ Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image 
or selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for 
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image.
 
✓ Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring 
to the whole image.
 
✓ Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but 
more intensely.
 
✓ Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll 
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of 
blurring you desire.
 
 Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camouflage moiré patterns on scanned 
images. A moiré pattern is caused when you scan halftone images. A half-
tone is created when a continuous tone image, such as a photo, is digitized 
and converted into a screen pattern of repeating lines (usually between 
85 and 150 lines per inch) and then printed. When you then scan that 
halftone, a second pattern results and is overlaid on the original pattern. 

241
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
These two different patterns bump heads and create a nasty moiré pattern. 
The Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t eliminate the moiré — it simply merges 
the dots and reduces the appearance of the pattern. Play with the Radius 
slider until you get an acceptable trade-off between less moiré and less 
focus. If you happen to have a descreen filter built into your scanning soft-
ware, you can use that, as well, during the scanning of the halftone image.
 
✓ Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects. 
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to 
select the Preview check box to see the effect while you enter your values.
 
✓ Radial Blur: Need to simulate a moving Ferris wheel or some other 
round object? This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the 
amount of blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along con-
centric circular lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or, choose Zoom to 
blur along radial lines and mimic the effect of zooming in to your image. 
Specify your desired Quality level. Because the Radial Blur filter is noto-
riously slow, Elements gives you the option of Draft (fast but grainy), 
Good, or Best (slow but smooth). The difference between Good and Best 
is evident only on large, high-resolution images. Finally, indicate where 
you want the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram thumbnail.
 
✓ Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify 
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the radius and threshold, 
both defined in the following section. Start with a lower value for both 
and adjust from there. Choose a quality setting from the pop-up menu. 
Choose a mode setting. Normal blurs the entire image or selection. Edge 
Only blurs only the edges of your elements and uses black and white in 
the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just the edges, but it applies 
only white to the blurred pixels.
 
✓ Surface Blur: This filter blurs the surface or interior of the image, 
instead of the edges. If you want to retain your edge details, but blur 
everything else, use this filter.
Sharpening for better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need any contrast, color, and flaw fixing, feel 
free to jump right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a scanner 
or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments. 
Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area in your image 
just so that it stands out more.
First, let us say that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s 
captured. But you can do a pretty good job of faking it. All sharpening tools 
work by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased 
contrast causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion 
that the focus is improved, as shown in Figure 10-15. Remember that you can 
also use the Sharpen tool for small areas, as described in Chapter 9. Here’s a 
description of the two sharpening commands:

242
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 10-15: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing contrast between 
adjacent pixels.
 
✓ Unsharp Mask: Unsharp Mask, on the Enhance menu in Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode, which gets its odd name from a darkroom technique, is the 
sharpening tool of choice. It gives you several options that enable you to 
control the amount of sharpening and the width of the areas to be sharp-
ened. Use them to pinpoint your desired sharpening:
 
• Amount: Specify an amount (from 1 to 500 percent) of edge sharp-
ening. The higher the value, the more contrast between pixels 
around the edges. Start with a value of 100 percent (or less), which 
usually gives good contrast without appearing overly grainy.
 
• Radius: Specify the width (from 0.1 to 250 pixels) of the edges 
that the filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the 
edge. The value you use is largely based on the resolution of your 
image. Low-resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-
resolution images require a higher value.
 
 Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes 
the edges of your image and makes it appear too “contrasty” or 
even “goopy” around the edges.
 
 A good guideline in selecting a starting radius value is to divide your 
image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300 ppi image, 
set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to adjust from there.
 
• Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255) that 
must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharp-
ened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast differ-
ence. Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are very dif-
ferent in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at 0 unless 
your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too high can cause 
unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharpened areas.
 
 Occasionally, the values you enter for Amount and Radius may sharpen the 
image effectively but in turn create excess grain, or noise, in your image. 
You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the Threshold value.

243
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
✓ Adjust Sharpness: When you’re looking for precision in your image 
sharpening, Unsharp Mask is one option. The Adjust Sharpness com-
mand, as shown in Figure 10-16, is the other. This feature enables you to 
control the amount of sharpening applied to shadow and highlight areas. 
It also allows you to select from various sharpening algorithms.
 
 Here are the various options you can specify:
 
• Amount and Radius: See the two descriptions in the preceding 
Unsharp Mask bullet list.
 
• Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the 
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects 
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while 
reducing the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion 
Blur tries to sharpen the blurring that occurs when you move the 
camera (or if your subject doesn’t sit still).
 
• Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algo-
rithm, described in the preceding bullet.
 
• More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly than the default 
speed for better accuracy.
Figure 10-16: The Adjust Sharpness command.
Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush tools
The Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush tools enable you to selectively apply 
an image adjustment or special effects that appear on all or part of your 
image. What’s even more exciting is that these adjustments and effects are 
applied via an adjustment layer, meaning that they “hover” over your layers 

244
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
and don’t permanently alter the pixels in your image. It also means that the 
adjustments can be flexibly edited and deleted, if so desired.
Follow these steps to use the Smart Brush tool:
 
1. Select the Smart Brush tool in the toolbar in Edit Full mode.
 
 The tool icon looks like a house paint brush with an adjacent gear. You 
can also press F, or Shift+F, if the Detail Smart Brush tool is visible.
 
2. Choose your desired brush attributes, such as diameter and hardness, 
from the Brush Picker drop-down panel.
 
 For more on working with brushes, see Chapter 12.
 
3. Select an adjust-
ment category and 
then your particular 
preset adjustment 
from the Smart 
Paint drop-down 
menu in the Options 
bar, as shown in 
Figure 10-17.
 
 Note that you can 
“tear off” this panel 
by grabbing the grip 
area in the upper-
left corner of the 
panel and dragging 
it anywhere in your 
application window 
(Windows) or on 
your screen (Mac). 
In the Smart Paint 
menu, you can find 
adjustments ranging 
from photographic effects, such as a vintage Yellowed Photo, to nature 
effects, such as Sunset (which gives a warm, orange glow to your image).
 
4. Paint an adjustment on the desired layer in your image.
 
 Note that while you paint, the Smart Brush tool attempts to detect edges 
in your image and snaps to those edges. In addition, while you brush, a 
selection border appears.
 
 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke. The accompanying layer mask also appears on that adjustment 
layer. For more on adjustment layers, see Chapter 8.
Figure 10-17: The Smart Brush enables you to paint on 
adjustments.

245
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
5. Using the Add and Subtract Smart Brush modes, fine-tune your 
adjusted area by adding and subtracting from it.
 
 When you add and subtract from your adjusted area, you’re essentially 
modifying your layer mask. Adding to your adjusted area adds white to 
your layer mask, and subtracting from your adjusted area adds black 
to your layer mask. For more on layer masks, see Chapter 8.
 
6. Select a different preset adjustment for your selected area, if you want.
 
 In fact, try them all out before you settle on your final choice.
 
7. If you feel you need to refine your selected area, select the Refine 
Edge option on the Options bar.
 
 For more on Refine Edge, See Chapter 7.
 
 If you’d rather apply the adjustment to your unselected area, select the 
Inverse option on the Options bar.
 
 If you want to modify your adjustment, double-click the Adjustment 
Layer pin on your image. The pin is annotated by a small, square black 
and red gear icon. After you double-click the pin, the dialog box cor-
responding to your particular adjustment appears. For example, if you 
double-click the Shoebox photo adjustment (under Photographic), you 
access the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
 
8. Make your necessary adjustments in the dialog box and click OK.
 
 You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) and select Change 
Adjustment Settings from the context menu that appears. Or you can 
select Delete Adjustment and Hide Selection from the same menu.
 
9. After you finish, simply deselect your selection by choosing Select➪
Deselect.
 
You can add multiple Smart Brush adjustments. After you apply one effect, 
reset the Smart Brush tool and apply additional adjustments.
Follow these steps to work with the Detail Smart Brush tool:
 
1. Select the Detail Smart Brush tool in the toolbar in Edit Full mode.
 
 This tool shares the flyout menu with the Smart Brush tool. The tool 
icon looks like an art paint brush with an adjacent gear. You can also 
press F, or Shift+F, if the Smart Brush tool is visible.
 
2. Choose a brush tip preset and brush size, and attributes from the 
Brushes drop-down panel.
 
 Feel free to change your brush tip and size as needed for your desired 
effect. For more on working with brushes, see Chapter 12. For better 

246
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
accessibility, you can “tear off” this panel (and the Smart Paint panel in 
Step 3) by grabbing the grip area in the upper-left corner of the panel 
and dragging it anywhere in your application window.
 
3. Select your desired adjustment category and then your particular 
preset adjustment from the Smart Paint drop-down menu in the 
Options bar.
 
 Several of the Special Effect adjustments are shown in Figure 10-18.
Figure 10-18: The Detail Smart Brush lets you paint on a variety of 
special effects.
 
4. Paint an adjustment on the desired layer in your image.
 
 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke, along with an accompanying layer mask. For details on adjust-
ment layers and layer masks, see Chapter 8.
 
5. Follow Steps 5 through 8 in the preceding list for the Smart Brush 
tool.

elve into the world of the Photoshop 
Elements artist, where you can use tools to 
draw and paint on existing photos, or create new, 
blank documents and create your own drawings. 
The tools rival an artist’s analog tools, and 
Photoshop Elements capabilities are limited only 
by your imagination. In this part, you can fi nd out 
how to apply different artistic effects by using 
many tools and customizing them for your own 
use, and you fi nd tips for creating some dazzling 
images.
In addition to describing the artistic effects you 
can apply to your photos, this part tells you how 
to handle working with text. When it comes time 
for creating a poster, an advertisement, or some 
Web icons, the text features in Elements offer you 
many options for creating headline type, body 
copy, and special type effects.

fter giving your images a makeover — edges 
cropped, color corrected, flaws repaired, focus 
sharpened — you may want to get them all gussied 
up for a night out on the town. You can do just that 
with filters, effects, layer styles, and blend modes. 
These features enable you to add that touch of 
emphasis, drama, whimsy, or just plain goofy fun. 
We’re the first to admit that often the simplest art 
(and that includes photographs) is the best. That 
gorgeous landscape shot or the portrait that per-
fectly captures the expression on a child’s happy face 
is something you may want to leave unembellished. 
But for the times when a little artistic experimentation is 
in order, turn to this chapter as your guide.
Having Fun with Filters
Filters have been around since the early days of digital imaging, when Photoshop 
was just a little bitty program. Filters, also called plug-ins because they can be 
installed or removed independently, change the look of your image in a variety 

250
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
of ways, as shown in Figure 11-1. They can correct less-than-perfect images by 
making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws, as we describe in Chap-
ter 10. Or they can enhance your images by making them appear as though 
they’re painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spotlights. Just make sure to create a 
backup of your original image if you plan on saving your filtered one. The follow-
ing sections give you the basics on how to apply a filter and give you a few filter-
ing tips.

Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
 
✓ In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode: From the Filter menu, choose 
your desired filter category and then select a specific filter.
 
✓ In Edit Full mode only: Choose Window➪Effects to open the panel. Click 
the Filters button at the top of the panel. Select your filter category from 
the drop-down list to the right of the buttons. Double-click the thumbnail 
of your desired filter or drag the filter onto your image window.
 
✓ In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode: Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery to apply 
one or more filters in a flexible editing environment. The Filter Gallery is 
described in the section, “Working in the Filter Gallery,” later in this chapter.
 
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of your image, 
or at least create a duplicate layer, before you apply filters. Filters change the 
pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter Gallery, the fil-
ters that are applied can’t be removed.

251
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
You can’t apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color mode. And 
some filters don’t work on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on color 
modes, see Chapter 3.
Corrective or destructive filters
Although there are no hard and fast rules, most digital-imaging folks classify 
filters into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:
 
✓ Corrective filters usually fix some kind of image problem. They adjust 
color, improve focus, remove dust or artifacts, and so on. Don’t get us 
wrong — pixels are still modified. It’s just that the basic appearance of 
the image remains the same, albeit hopefully improved. Two of the most 
popular corrective filters, Sharpen and Blur, are covered in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Destructive filters are used to create some kind of special effect. Pixels 
are also modified, but the image may look quite a bit different from its 
original. These kinds of filters create effects, such as textures, brush 
strokes, mosaics, lights, and clouds. They can also distort an image with 
waves, spheres, and ripples.
One-step or multistep filters
All corrective and destructive filters are either one-step filters or multistep 
filters. One-step filters have no options and no dialog boxes; select the filter 
and watch the magic happen. Multistep filters act almost like mini-applications. 
Choose the filter to open a dialog box that has options for you to specify. The 
options vary widely depending on the filter, but most come equipped with at 
least one option to control the intensity of the filter. A multistep filter appears 
on the menu with an ellipsis following its name, indicating that a dialog box 
follows the execution of the command.
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full effects of a filter applied to your image. 
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less “com-
puterish.” Here’s what you can do:
 
1. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer and then click OK when the dialog 
box appears.
 
2. Apply your desired filter to the duplicate layer.
 
3. Use the blend modes and opacity settings located on the Layers panel 
to merge the filtered layer with the original unfiltered image.

252
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
4. (Optional) With the Eraser tool, selectively erase portions of your fil-
tered image to enable the unfiltered image to show through.
 
 For example, if you applied a Gaussian Blur filter to soften a harshly lit 
portrait, try erasing the blurred portion that covers the subject’s eyes 
to let the unblurred eyes of the layer below show through. The sharply 
focused eyes provide a natural focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
Up to this point in the book, we refer to applying filters to your images. But 
we use this word rather loosely. You don’t necessarily have to apply filters to 
your entire image. You can apply filters to individual layers or even to selec-
tions. You can often get better effects when you apply a filter just to a por-
tion of an image or layer. For example, you can blur a distracting background 
so that the person in your image gets due attention. Or, as shown in Figure 
11-2, you can apply an Ocean Ripple or Wave filter to the ocean, leaving your 
surfer unfiltered to avoid that overly “Photoshopped” effect.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-2: Selectively applying a filter can prevent an image from looking overly manipulated.

253
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
Exercising a little restraint in applying filters usually produces a more attrac-
tive image.
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, don’t be surprised if you’re presented with a gargantuan 
dialog box. This editing window, as it’s officially called, is the Filter Gallery. 
You can also access it by choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flexible Filter 
Gallery, you can apply multiple filters, as well as edit them ad nauseum.
Follow these steps to work in the Filter Gallery:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
 
 The Filter Gallery editing window appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
2. In the center of the editing window, click your desired filter category 
folder.
 
 The folder expands and shows the filters in that category. A thumbnail 
displays each filter’s effect.

3. Select your desired filter.
 
 You get a large, dynamic preview of your image on the left side of the 
dialog box. To preview a different filter, just select it. Use the magnifica-
tion controls to zoom in and out of the preview. To hide the Filter menu 
and get a larger preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
 
4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.
 
 The preview is updated accordingly.
 
5. When you’re happy with the results, click OK to apply the filter and 
close the editing window.
 
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button 
at the bottom of the editing window.
 
 This step duplicates the existing filter.
 
7. Choose your desired new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in 
the Applied Filters area of the dialog box.
 
 Each filter you apply is displayed in the lower-right area of the Filter 
Gallery dialog box. To delete a filter, select it and click the Delete Effect 
Layer button. To edit a filter’s settings, select it from the list and make 
any changes. Keep in mind that when you edit a filter’s settings, the edit 
may affect the look of any subsequent filters you’ve applied. Finally, you 
can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Doing so changes the over-
all effect, however.
 
8. When you’re completely done, click OK to apply the filters and close 
the editing window.
Distorting with the Liquify Filter
The Liquify filter is really much more than a filter. It’s a distortion that allows 
you to manipulate an image as though it were warm taffy. You can interac-
tively twist, pull, twirl, pinch, and bloat parts of your image. You can even put 
your image on a diet, as we did in Figure 11-4. You can apply this distortion 
filter on the entire image, on a layer, or on a selection. This überfilter comes 
equipped with a “mega” dialog box with its own set of tools (on the left) and 
options (on the right), as shown in Figure 11-4.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Follow these steps to turn your image into a melted Dalí-esque wannabe:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
 
 Your image appears in the preview area.
 
2. Choose your distortion weapon of choice.
 
 You also have a number of tools to help zoom and navigate around your 
image window.
 
 Here’s a description of each tool to help you decide which to use. (The 
letter in parentheses is the keyboard shortcut.)
 
• Warp (W): This tool pushes pixels forward while you drag, creating 
a stretched effect. Use short strokes or long pushes.
 
• Turbulence (T): Drag to randomly jumble your pixels. Use this 
tool to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, 
flames, and waves. Adjust how smooth the effect is by dragging 
the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the 
value, the smoother the effect.
 
• Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): These options 
rotate pixels either clockwise or counterclockwise. Place the 
cursor in one spot, hold down the mouse button, and watch the 
pixels under your brush rotate; or drag the cursor to create a 
moving twirl effect.
 
• Pucker (P): Click and hold or drag to pinch your pixels toward the 
center of the area covered by the brush. To reverse the pucker 
direction (bloat), press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you 
hold or drag.
 
• Bloat (B): Click and hold or drag to push pixels toward the edge of 
the brush area. To reverse the bloat direction (pucker), press the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you hold or drag.
 
• Shift Pixels (S): This tool moves pixels to the left when you drag 
the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag 
clockwise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag 
counterclockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any direction, 
press Alt (Option on the Mac) while you hold or drag.
 
• Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at 
a 90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key to force the reflection in the direction 
opposite the motion of the brush. This tool works well for making 
reflections on water.
 
• Resconstruct (E): See Step 4 for an explanation of this tool’s function.

257
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
• Zoom (Z): This tool, which works like the Zoom tool on the 
Elements Tools panel, zooms you in and out so that you can better 
see your distortions. 
 
 You can zoom out by holding down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key 
when you press Z. You can also zoom by selecting a magnification per-
centage from the pop-up list in the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
 
• Hand (H): This tool works like the Hand tool on the Elements Tools 
panel. Drag with the Hand tool to move the image around the pre-
view window.
 
3. Specify your options in the Tool Options area:
 
• Brush Size: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 600 
pixels to specify the width of your brush.
 
• Brush Pressure: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 
100 to change the pressure. The higher the pressure, the faster the 
distortion effect is applied.
 
• Turbulent Jitter: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 100 
to adjust the smoothness when you’re using the Turbulence tool.
 
• Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet and 
stylus, click this option to select the pressure of your stylus.
 
4. If you get a little carried away, select the Reconstruct tool and then 
hold down or drag the mouse on the distorted portions of the image 
that you want to reverse or reconstruct.
 
 Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s 
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure 
and watch closely while your mouse drags across the distorted areas.
 
5. Click OK to apply the distortions and close the dialog box.
 
 However, if you mucked up things and want to start again, click the 
Revert button to get your original, unaltered image back. This action 
also resets the tools to their previous settings.
Correcting Camera Distortion
If you’ve ever tried to capture a looming skyscraper or cathedral in the lens 
of your camera, you know that it often involves tilting your camera and put-
ting your neck in an unnatural position. And then, after all that, what you end 
up with is a distorted view of what was an impressive building in real life, as 
shown with the before image on the left in Figure 11-5. That’s not a problem 

258
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
with Elements — now. The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the distorted 
perspective created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the camera. As a 
bonus, this filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused by lens snafus.
Here’s how to fix all:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode.
 
2. In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, be sure to select the 
Preview option.
 
3. Specify your correction options:
 
• Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes your images 
to appear spherized or bloated. This distortion can occur when 
you’re using wide-angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distor-
tion, which creates images that appear to be pinched in at the 
center, a flaw that’s found when using telephoto or zoom lenses. 
Slide the slider while keeping an eye on the preview. Use the handy 
grid as your guide for proper alignment.
 
• Vignette Amount: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening 
around the edges of your photo that you can get sometimes from 
incorrect lens shading. Change the width of the adjustment by speci-
fying a midpoint value. A lower midpoint value affects more of the 
image. Then, move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
Figure 11-5: The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes distortions caused by camera tilt and lens flaws.

259
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
• Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by 
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your 
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective to correct the build-
ing shown in Figure 11-5.
 
• Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving 
the camera (or a subject who can’t sit still). For better results, set 
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
 
• Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting 
the camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after 
correcting the vertical or horizontal perspective.
 
• Edge Extension Scale: When you correct the perspective on your 
image, you may be left with blank areas on your canvas. You can 
scale your image up or down to crop into the image and eliminate 
these “holes.” Note that scaling up results in interpolating your 
image up to its original pixel dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, 
be sure to start with an image that has a high-enough pixel dimen-
sion, or resolution, to avoid severe degradation. For more on reso-
lution and interpolation, see Chapter 3.
 
• Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid, as needed. Choose the color 
of your grid lines.
 
• Zoom Tool: Zooms in and out for your desired view. You can 
also use plus and minus icons and the zoom pop-up menu in the 
bottom left of the window.
 
• Hand Tool: Moves you around the image window when you are 
zoomed in.
 
4. Click OK to apply the correction and close the dialog box.
Dressing Up with Photo and Text Effects
In addition to the multitude of filters at your disposal, Elements also provides 
a lot of different effects that you can apply to enhance your photos. Note that 
some effects automatically create a duplicate of the selected layer, whereas 
other effects can work only on flattened images. (See Chapter 8 for details on 
layers.) Finally, unlike with filters, you can’t preview how the effect will look 
on your image or type, nor do you have any options to specify.
Here are the short steps to follow to apply an effect:
 
1. Select your desired image layer in the Layers panel.
 
 Or, if you’re applying the effect to just a selection, make the selection 
before applying the effect.

260
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
2. Choose Window➪Effects.
 
3. Select the Photo Effects button at the top of the panel.
 
4. Select your desired category of photo effects from the drop-down list 
in the upper-right area of the panel:
 
• Frame: Includes effects that enhance the edges of the layer or 
selection, as shown in Figure 11-6.
 
• Faded Photo, Monotone Color, Old Photo, and Vintage Photo: This 
group of effects makes your image fade from color to grayscale, 
appear as a single color, or look like an old pencil sketch or a 
photo on old paper.
 
• Misc Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to make your image 
appear as though it’s snowing, made of lizard skin or neon tubes, 
or painted with oil pastels.
 
• Show All: Shows all the effects described in this list.
PhotoSpin

 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
5. On the Effects panel, double-click your desired effect or drag the 
effect onto the image.
 
 Note that you can view your styles and effects by thumbnails or by list. 
To change the view, click More in the upper-right corner of the panel.
 
You can also apply an effect to type. Select your type layer and follow Steps 
2–5 in the preceding list. Note that a dialog box alerts you that the type layer 
must be simplified before the effect can be applied. Simplifying the layer, of 
course, means you lose any text editability.
Adding Shadows, Glows, and More
Going hand in hand with filters and photo effects are layer styles. Also 
designed to enhance your image and type layers, layer styles range from 
simple shadows and bevels to the more complex styles, such as buttons and 
patterns. The wonderful thing about layer styles is that they’re completely 
nondestructive. Unlike filters, layer styles don’t change your pixel data. You 
can edit them or even delete them if you’re unhappy with the results.
Here are some important facts about layer styles:
 
✓ Layer styles can be applied only to layers. If your image is just a back-
ground, convert it to a layer first.
 
✓ Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you 
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
 
✓ When you apply a layer style to a layer, an fx symbol appears next to 
the layer’s name on the Layers panel. Double-click the fx to bring up 
the Style Settings dialog box and perform any editing that’s necessary to 
get the look you want.
Applying layer styles
Layer styles are stored in a few different libraries. You can add shadows, 
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more complex styles, such as neon, 
plastic, chrome, and various other image effects. A sampling of styles is 
shown in Figure 11-7.
Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of the style 
libraries:
 
1. Select your desired image or type layer on the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Window➪Effects.
 
3. Select the Layer Styles button at the top of the Effects panel.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-7: Add dimension by applying shadows and bevels to your object or type.
 
4. Select your desired library of styles from the drop-down list in the 
upper-right area of the panel:
 
• Bevels: Bevels add a three-dimensional edge on the outside or 
inside edges of the contents of a layer, giving the element some 
dimension. Emboss styles make elements appear as though they’re 
raised off of or punched into the page. You can change the appear-
ance of these styles, depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust 
parameters, such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the 
shadow is to the layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
 
• Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a 
layer. Choose from the garden-variety shadow or one that includes 
noise, neon, or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, distance, 
size, and opacity, as desired.
 
• Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside 
or inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of the 
glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the glow.
 
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to display, hide, or partially 
show the layer contents. The Layer Style remains fully displayed.
 
• Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a cornucopia 
of different effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more 
exotic effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can 
customize all these layer styles to a certain extent by adjusting 
the various settings, which are similar to those for other styles in 
this list.

263
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
5. On the Layer Styles panel, double-click your desired effect or drag the 
effect onto the image.
 
 The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer 
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, one 
style from each library — to a single layer.
 
 To edit the style’s settings, either double-click the fx on the Layers panel 
or choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings.
 
 You can also apply layer styles to type layers, and the type layer doesn’t 
need to be simplified.
Working with layer styles
Here are a few last tips for working with layer styles:
 
✓ Delete a layer style or styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer 
Style or drag the fx icon on the Layers panel to the trash can icon.
 
✓ Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers. Select the layer contain-
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. 
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. If it’s easier, you can also 
just drag and drop an effect from one layer to another while holding 
down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
 
✓ Hide or show layer styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects 
or Show All Effects.
 
✓ Scale a layer style. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select 
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This action 
allows you to scale the style without scaling the element.
Mixing It Up with Blend Modes
Elements sports a whopping 25 blend modes. Blend modes affect how colors 
interact between layers and also how colors interact when you apply paint 
to a layer. Not only do blend modes create interesting effects, but you can 
also easily apply, edit, or remove blend modes without touching your image 
pixels.
The various blend modes are located on a drop-down list at the top of your 
Layers panel in Edit Full mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect of 
blend modes is not to memorize the descriptions we give you in the follow-
ing sections. Instead, grab an image with some layers and apply each of the 
blend modes to one or more of the layers to see what happens. The exact 
result varies, depending on the colors in your image layers. 

264
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
General blend modes
The Normal blend mode needs 
no introduction. It’s the one 
you probably use the most. 
Dissolve is the next one on the 
list and, ironically, is probably 
the one you use the least. (Both 
blend modes are illustrated in 
Figure 11-8.)
 
✓ Normal: The default 
mode displays each pixel 
unadjusted.
 
✓ Dissolve: This mode can be 
seen only on a layer with an 
opacity setting of less than 
100 percent. It allows some 
pixels from lower layers, 
which are randomized, to show through the target (selected) layer.
Darken blend modes
These blend modes produce effects that darken your image in various ways, 
as shown in Figure 11-9.

Multiply
Color Burn

265
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
✓ Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are lighter than those below. If the pixels are darker, they’re unchanged.
 
✓ Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby 
darkening all colors where they mix. When you’re painting with the 
Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker color, as though 
you’re drawing with markers.
 
✓ Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns 
them with color, creating a contrast effect, like applying a dark dye to 
your image.
 
✓ Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas-
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply but often makes 
parts of your image black.
 
✓ Darker Color: When blending two layers, the darker color of the two 
colors is visible.
Lighten blend modes
The lighten blend modes are the opposite of the darken blend modes. All 
these blend modes create lightening effects on your image, as shown in 
Figure 11-10.
 
✓ Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are darker than those below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re unchanged. 
This effect is the opposite of Darken.
 
✓ Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under-
neath. This effect is the opposite of Multiply.
 
✓ Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target 
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. This effect is simi-
lar to applying a bleach to your image.
 
✓ Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by 
increasing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often 
makes parts of your image white.
 
✓ Lighter Color: When blending two layers, the lighter color of the two 
colors is visible.

Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers, as shown in 
Figure 11-11.
 
✓ Overlay: Overlay multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and 
screens the light pixels in the underlying layers. It also enhances the 
contrast and saturation of colors.
 
✓ Soft Light: This mode darkens the dark (greater than 50 percent gray) 
pixels and lightens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels. The effect 
is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 
✓ Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark (greater than 50 percent 
gray) pixels and screens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels. The 
effect is similar to shining a bright, hard spotlight on the image.
 
✓ Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent 
gray, this mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the 
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by decreasing the contrast.
 
✓ Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent 
gray, the mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the 
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by increasing the brightness.
 
✓ Pin Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent gray, 
the mode replaces pixels darker than those on the top layer and doesn’t 

267
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
change lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 
percent gray, the mode replaces the pixels lighter than those on the top 
layer and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. The mode is usually 
reserved for special effects.
 
✓ Hard Mix: This mode is similar to Vivid Light but reduces the colors to a 
total of eight — cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and white. 
This mode creates a posterized effect.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Inverter blend modes
The Inverter blend modes invert 
your colors and tend to produce 
some radical effects, as shown in 
Figure 11-12.
 
✓ Difference: Produces a 
negative effect according to 
the brightness values on the 
top layers. If the pixels on 
the top layer are black, no 
change occurs in the under-
lying layers. If the pixels on 
the top layer are white, the 
mode inverts the colors of 
the underlying layers.
 
✓ Exclusion: Like Difference, 
but with less contrast and 
saturation. If the pixels on 
the top layer are black, no change occurs in the underlying layers. If 
the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts the colors of the 
underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create shades of gray.
HSL blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color model to 
mix colors, as shown in Figure 11-13.
 
✓ Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the 
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
 
✓ Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with 
the saturation of the top layer.
 
✓ Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation 
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while pre-
serving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
 
 The Color mode is a great tool for colorizing images. If you’ve ever 
admired those hand-tinted black-and-white photos used in greeting 
cards and posters, you can create the same effect fairly easily. First, 
make sure that your black-and-white image is in RGB (red, green, blue) 
mode so that it can accept color. Create a new layer on the Layers 
panel and set it to the Color blend mode. Grab the Brush tool (with a

soft-edged tip), choose your desired color, and paint over your image. 
Adjust your opacity to less than 100 percent to create a softer effect.
 
✓ Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and satura-
tion of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer. This 
mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top 
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.

Using Photomerge
The awesome Photomerge features help you to create fabulous composites 
from multiple images. Whether it’s creating the perfect shot of a group of 
friends or of your favorite vacation spot without passing cars and people, the 
Photomerge feature is the go-to tool to get it done. The following sections tell 
you how the Photomerge commands help to create the special type of com-
posite image you need.
Photomerge Panorama
The Photomerge Panorama command enables you to combine multiple 
images into a single panoramic image. From skylines to mountain ranges, 
you can take several overlapping shots and stitch them together into one. 
To be successful at merging photos into a panorama, you need to start with 
good source files. First of all, make sure that when you shoot your photos, 
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 

270
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
50 percent. Then, avoid using distortion lenses (such as fish-eye) and your 
camera’s zoom setting. Also, try to keep the same exposure settings for even 
lighting. Lastly, try to stay in the same position and keep your camera at the 
same level for each photo. Using a tripod and rotating the head can help you 
get shots at the same camera level.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Panorama image:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Panorama in Edit Full mode.
 
2. In the first Photomerge dialog box, select your source files.
 
 You can select Files or Folder from the Use drop-down list.
 
3. Click Add Open Files to use all open files, or click the Browse button 
and navigate to where your files or folder are located.
 
4. Choose your desired mode under Layout.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each mode:
 
• Auto: Elements analyzes your images.
 
• Perspective: If you shot your images with perspective or at extreme 
angles, this is your mode. Try this mode if you shot your images 
with a tripod.
 
• Cylindrical: If you shot your images with a wide-angle lens or you 
have those 360-degree, full panoramic shots, this is a good mode.
 
• Reposition Only: Elements doesn’t take any distortion into account; 
it simply scans the images and positions them in the best position.
 
 If you choose any of the preceding modes, Elements opens and 
automatically assembles the source files to create the composite 
panorama in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks good, skip 
to Step 7.
 
 Elements alerts you if it can’t automatically composite your source 
files. You then have to assemble the images manually.
 
• Interactive Layout: This option opens the work area pane, as shown 
in Figure 11-14. Elements tries to align and stitch the images the 
best it can, but you may have to manually complete or adjust the 
panorama. 
 
 Note that with any of the modes, Elements leaves your merged image in 
layers. You’ll also notice that a layer mask has been added to each layer 
to better blend your panoramic image. For more on layer masks, see 
Chapter 8.
 
5. If Elements hasn’t already done so for you, drag the image thumbnails 
from the lightbox area (the small white area at the top) onto the work 
area with the Select Image tool (the arrow), or simply double-click the 
lightbox thumbnail to add it to the composition.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-14: Combine multiple images into a single panorama with Photomerge.
 
6. Arrange and position your images:
 
• Select Image tool: Positions the images.
 
• Rotate Image tool: Makes rotations.
 
• Zoom and Move View tools: Helps view and navigate around your 
panorama.
 
• Navigator view box: Zooms into and out of your composition when 
you drag the slider.
 
• Snap to Image option: Enables overlapping images to automatically 
snap into place.
 
7. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in 
the Settings area and click your desired image with the Set Vanishing 
Point tool.
 
 Elements changes the perspective of the composition. By default, 
Elements selects the center image as the vanishing point. If necessary, 
you can move the other images.
 
 Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links 
non–Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break 
the link, click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the 
work area.

272
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
8. Click OK to create the panorama.
 
 The file opens as a new, unsaved file in Elements. Note that you can 
also click the Save Composition button to save the file as a Photomerge 
Composition (.pmg) file. We would avoid this, however, because the file 
format isn’t very compatibility friendly.
Photomerge Group Shot
We all know how hard it is to get a group of people to all look great in one 
shot. Well, Photomerge Group Shot lets you take multiple group photos and 
merge the best of them to get that perfect shot.
Here are the steps to create a Photomerge Group Shot image:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Project Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Group Shot in any of the Edit modes.
 
3. Take your best overall group shot and drag it from the Project Bin 
onto the Final window.
 
4. Select one of your other photos in the Project Bin to use as your 
Source image. Drag it to the Source window.
 
5. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the portions of the Source 
photo you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in Fig-
ure 11-15.
 
 You can choose to show your pencil strokes and/or show your regions, 
which will be highlighted with an overlay.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 through 5 with any remaining photos.
 
 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the 
Advanced Options.
 
7. With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations. Do the same on the Final 
image and choose similar locations.
 
8. Click the Align Photos button.
 
 As with Photomerge Panorama, the more alike in framing, size, and so 
on, that your source and final images are, the better the merged result.
 
9. If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.
 
10. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
 
 The file opens as a new file in Elements.

Photomerge Faces
Photomerge Faces, more of a fun than useful 
tool, lets you blend features from multiple faces 
to get a kind of hybrid face. To create a hybrid 
human by using the Photomerge Faces feature, 
select two or more photos from your Project Bin 
and choose File➪New➪Photomerge Faces in 
any of the Edit modes. Use the Alignment and 
Pencil tools to choose how you’d like to merge 
the photos, similar to the steps described in the 
section, “Photomerge Group Shot.”

Photomerge Scene Cleaner
Photomerge Scene Cleaner (see Figure 11-16) sounds like a tool you might see 
in an episode of CSI to mop up a crime scene, but it isn’t quite that gory. This 
recent addition to the family of Photomerge commands enables you to create 
the optimum image by allowing you to eliminate annoying distractions, such 
as cars, passersby, and so on.
To get the best Source images for a “clean scene,” be sure to take multiple 
shots of your scene from the same angle and distance. It also works best 
when the elements you want to eliminate are moving.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Scene Cleaner composite:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Project Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Scene Cleaner in any of the Edit 
modes.
 
 Elements attempts to auto-align your images the best it can.
 
3. Take your best overall shot of the scene and drag it from the Project 
Bin onto the Final window.
 
4. Select one of your other photos in the Project Bin to use as your 
Source image. Drag it to the Source window.
 
5. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the elements in the Final 
photo that you want to be replaced by content from the Source photo.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the remaining shots of the scene.
 
 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the 
Advanced Options.
 
7. With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations.
 
 Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.
 
8. Click the Align Photos button, as shown in Figure 11-16.
 
 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar your 
starting Source images are (similar framing, similar angle), the better the 
merged result.
 
9. If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.
 
10. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
 
 The file opens as a new file in Elements.

Figure 11-16: Eliminate annoying distractions with Photomerge Scene Cleaner.
Photomerge Exposure
 
Sometimes you need to capture a shot that poses an exposure challenge — 
your foreground and background require different exposure settings. This 
dilemma often occurs in shots that are backlit. For example, you have a 
person in front of an indoor window in the day, or someone in front of a 
lit nighttime cityscape. With the new Photomerge Exposure, you can take 
shots with two different exposure settings and let the command blend them 
together for the perfect shot. 
You can shoot your initial images using exposure bracketing (shooting at 
consecutive exposure camera settings) or with a flash and then without. 
Elements will be able to detect all of these camera settings. We recommend 
that you use a tripod, if possible, to keep your shots aligned. This will help 
the blending algorithm do its job.
Here’s how to use this great new command:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Project Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Exposure in any of the Edit modes.
 
 You can also perform this task in the Organizer, or in Adobe Bridge on 
the Mac. Just select any two images and choose the same command.

276
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
3. If you have done a good job keeping your shots aligned, leave the 
mode on Automatic.
 
 Select the quickie Simple Blending option and Elements automatically 
blends the two images. Select the Smart Blending option to access sliders 
to adjust the Highlights, Shadows, and Saturation settings for finer tuning 
of the resulting images. If you muck things up, click the Reset button.
 
4. If you feel the need for even more control, click on the Manual 
mode tab.
 
5. In Manual mode, choose your first shot from the Project Bin and drag 
it to the Final window. If your other image isn’t already the Source 
image, drag it from the Project Bin to the Source window.
 
6. With the Pencil tool, draw over the well-exposed areas you want to 
retain in the Source image. As you draw, your Final image will show 
the incorporation of those drawn areas, as shown in Figure 11-18.
 
7. If you mistakenly draw over something you don’t want, grab the 
Eraser tool and erase the Pencil tool marks.
 
 Choose to have your preview show strokes and/or regions.
 
8. You can further control the blending by dragging the Transparency 
slider. 
 
 Dragging to the right will blend less of the Source areas into the Final 
image. Check the Edge blending option to get an even better blend of the 
two images.
 
9. If your photos aren’t aligning correctly, grab the Alignment Tool 
under Advanced Options. 
 
 With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the three 
target markers on three key locations.
 
 Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.
 
10. Click the Align Photos button.
 
 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar your 
starting source images are (similar framing, similar angle), the better the 
merged result.
 
11. Again, if you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.
 
12. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
 
 The file opens as a new, layered file in Elements. The blended image will 
appear on Layer 1. The background will be your starting Final image. 
You can either flatten the layered file which will retain the appearance of 
Layer 1. Or you can double-click your Background to convert it to a layer 
and then delete it by dragging it to the trash icon in the Layers palette.

E
lements is such a deluxe, full-service, image-editing program that it 
doesn’t just stop at giving you tools to select, repair, organize, and 
share your images. It figures that you may need to add a swash of 
color, either freeform with a brush or pencil, or in the form 
of a geometric or organic shape. Don’t worry: This draw-
ing and painting business isn’t just for those with innate 
artistic talent. In fact, Elements gives you plenty of 
preset brushes and shapes that you can use. If you 
can pick a tool and drag your mouse, you can draw 
and paint.
Choosing Color
Before you start drawing or painting, you may want 
to change your color to something other than the 
default black. If you’ve read the earlier chapters in this 
book, we’re sure that you checked out the Elements Tools 
panel and noticed the two overlapping color swatches at the 
bottom of the panel. These two swatches represent two categories of 
color: foreground and background. Here’s a quick look at how they work with 
different tools:

278
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
✓ When you add type, paint with the Brush tool, or create a shape, you’re 
using the foreground color.
 
✓ On the background layer of an image, when you erase with the Eraser 
tool, or when you increase the size of your canvas, you’re accessing the 
background color.
 
✓ When you drag with the Gradient tool, so long as your gradient is set to 
the default, you’re laying down a blend of color from the foreground to 
the background.
Elements gives you three ways to choose your foreground and background 
colors: the Color Picker; the color swatches; and the Eyedropper tool, which 
samples color in an image. In the following sections, we explore each one.
Working with the Color Picker
By default, Elements uses a black foreground color and a white background 
color. If you’re experimenting with color and want to go back to the default 
color, press the D key. If you want to swap between foreground and back-
ground colors, press the X key. If you want any other color of the rainbow, 
click your desired swatch to change either the foreground or background 
color. This action transports you to the Color Picker, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Here are the steps to choose your color via the Color Picker:
 
1. Click either the foreground or background color swatch on the Tools 
panel.
 
 The Color Picker appears.
 
2. Drag the color slider or click the color bar to get close to the general 
color you desire.
 
3. Choose the exact color you want by clicking in the large square, or 
color field, on the left.
 
 The circle cursor targets your selected color. The two swatches in the 
upper-right corner of the dialog box represent your newly selected color 
and the original foreground or background color.
 
 The numeric values on the right side of the dialog box also change 
according to the color you selected. If you happen to know the values 
of your desired color, you may also enter them in the text boxes. 
Remember that RGB (red, green, blue) values are based on brightness 
levels, from 0 (black) to 255 (white). You can also enter HSB (hue, satu-
ration, brightness) values, or the hexadecimal formula for Web colors.
 
4. When you’re happy with your color, click OK.

Dipping into the Color Swatches panel
Another way Elements enables you to choose a 
foreground or background color is by selecting 
a color on the Color Swatches panel. The Color 
Swatches panel is a digital version of the artist’s 
paint palette. In addition to preset colors, you 
can mix and store your own colors for use now 
and later. You can have several palettes for cer-
tain types of projects or images. For example, you 
may want a palette of skin tones for retouching 
portraits. Choose Window➪Color Swatches to 
bring up the panel, as shown in Figure 12-2.
To grab a color from the Color Swatches panel, 
click the color swatch you want. By the way, it 
doesn’t matter which tool you have. As soon as 
you move the tool over the panel, it temporarily converts to an 
eyedropper that samples the color and makes it your new foreground 
or background color.
Figure 12-2: The Color 
Swatches panel.

280
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
Although the Color Swatches panel is a breeze to use, here are a few tips to 
help you along:
 
✓ Change the background color. Either first select the background swatch 
on the Tools panel or Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) a swatch.
 
✓ Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, select 
it from the Color Swatches panel drop-down list. Elements offers librar-
ies specific to Web graphics, photo filters, and Windows and Mac OS 
systems.
 
✓ Add a color to the Color Swatches panel. Choose New Swatch from the 
panel pop-up menu. You can also simply click an empty portion of the 
panel. Name your swatch and click OK.
 
✓ Save swatches. Choose Save Swatches from the panel pop-up menu in 
the upper-right corner of the panel. We recommend saving the swatch 
library in the default Color Swatches folder in the Presets folder. If by 
chance this folder doesn’t come up by default, just navigate to the Color 
Swatches folder by following this partial path: Adobe\Photoshop 
Elements 8.0\Presets\Color Swatches.
 
✓ Load swatches. If you want to load a custom library created by you 
or someone else, choose Load Swatches from the panel pop-up menu. 
In the dialog box, select your desired library from the Color Swatches 
folder. The new library is appended (added) to your current library.
 
 You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. For more 
on the Preset Manager, see Chapter 2.
 
✓ Delete swatches. To delete a swatch, drag it to the trash can at the 
bottom of the panel or Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the swatch.
 
✓ Change the panel’s appearance. Click the panel menu button in the 
upper-right corner to choose from Small or Large Thumbnail (swatch 
squares) or Small or Large List (swatch squares with a name).
 
✓ Replace your current swatch library with a different library. Choose 
Replace Swatches from the panel pop-up menu. Choose a library from 
the Color Swatches folder.
Sampling with the Eyedropper tool
Another way that Elements enables you to choose color is via the Eyedropper 
tool. The Eyedropper tool comes in handy when you want to sample an exist-
ing color in an image and use it for another element. For example, you may 
want your text to be the same color as the green background in the image 
shown in Figure 12-3. Grab the Eyedropper tool (or press I) and click a shade 
of green in the background. The tool samples the color and makes it your new 
foreground color. You can then create the type with your new foreground color.

281
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-3: The Eyedropper tool enables you to sample color from your image to 
use with other elements, such as type.
 
Here are a few things to remember when you’re using the Eyedropper tool:
 
✓ Sample a new foreground or background color. Obviously, you can 
select either the foreground or background swatch on the Tools panel 
before you sample a color. But if the foreground color swatch is active, 
holding down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) samples a new back-
ground color, and vice versa.
 
✓ Choose a color from any open image. If you have multiple images open, 
you can even sample a color from an image that you’re not working on!
 
✓ Choose your sample size on the Options bar. You can select the color 
of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample), or Elements can average 
the colors of the pixels in a 3-x-3- or 5-x-5-pixel area.
 
✓ Make colors Web safe. If you right-click your image to bring up the con-
text menu, you have a hidden option: Copy Color as HTML. This option 

282
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
provides the Web hexadecimal color formula for that sampled color and 
copies it to the Clipboard. You can then paste that formula into an HTML 
file or grab the Type tool and choose Edit➪Paste to view the formula in 
your image.
 
✓ Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. Elements, multitasker 
that it is, enables you to temporarily access the Eyedropper tool when 
you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color Replacement, Gradient, Paint 
Bucket, Cookie Cutter, or Shape tool. Simply press the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key to access the Eyedropper. Release the Alt (Option on the Mac) 
key to go back to your original tool.
Getting Artsy with the Pencil and Brush Tools
If you’ve read the first part of this chapter and have been thoroughly doused 
with every way to choose a color, you probably want to find out how to paint 
and draw with that color. The Pencil and Brush tools give you the power to 
put your creative abilities to work, and the following sections show you how.
 
When you use these two tools, you benefit immensely from the use of a 
pressure-sensitive digital drawing tablet. The awkwardness of trying to draw 
or paint with a mouse disappears and leaves you with tools that behave 
much closer to their analog ancestors.
Drawing with the Pencil tool
Drawing with the Pencil tool creates hard edges. 
You can’t get the soft, feathery edges that you 
can with the Brush tool. In fact, the edges of a 
pencil stroke can’t even be anti-aliased. (For more 
on anti-aliasing, see the following section.) Keep 
in mind that if you draw anything other than ver-
tical or horizontal lines, your lines will have some 
jaggies when they’re viewed up close. But hey, 
don’t diss the Pencil just yet. Those hard-edged 
strokes can be perfect for Web graphics. What’s 
more, the Pencil tool can erase itself, and it’s 
great for digital sketches, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Follow these steps to become familiar with the 
Pencil tool:
 
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the N key. By default, the 
Pencil tool’s brush tip is the 1-pixel brush. 
Yes, even though the Pencil tip is hard-edged, we still refer to it as a brush.
Illustration by Chris Blair
Figure 12-4: The Pencil tool can 
be used for digital drawings.

283
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
2. On the Options bar, choose your desired pencil options, beginning 
with a brush preset. Click the arrow and select your desired brush 
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
 To load another preset library, click the Brushes menu at the top of the 
panel.
 
 Remember that you aren’t limited to the standard old brush strokes. 
Check out the Assorted and Special Effects brushes found in the Brushes 
drop-down list on the Brushes panel. You’ll be surprised by the inter-
esting brushes lurking on these panels. Use them to create standalone 
images or to enhance your photographic creations.
 
 Access the pop-up menu on the Brushes panel to save, rename, or delete 
individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries. For 
more on these operations, see the following section.
 
3. Choose your brush size.
 
 A preset brush’s pixel diameter is shown as text below a thumbnail 
image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size of that brush 
tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.
 
4. Select a blending mode.
 
 Blend modes alter the way the color you’re applying interacts with 
the color on your canvas. You can find more about blend modes in 
Chapter 11.
 
5. If you want the background to show through your strokes, adjust the 
opacity by dragging the slider or entering an Opacity percentage less 
than 100 percent.
 
 The lower the percentage, the more the background images show 
through.
 
 Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to 
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you draw them. For 
more on layers, see Chapter 8.
 
6. Select Auto Erase if you want to enable that option.
 
 This option removes portions of your pencil strokes. For example, say 
that your foreground color is black and your background color is white, 
and you apply some black strokes. With Auto Erase enabled, you apply 
white if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the white 
background, you apply black.
 
7. Click and drag with the mouse to create your freeform lines.
 
 To draw straight lines, click at a starting point, release the mouse 
button, and then Shift-click at a second point.

284
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool creates soft-edged strokes. How soft those strokes are 
depends on which brush you use. By default, even the hardest brush has a 
slightly soft edge because it’s anti-aliased. Anti-aliasing creates a single row 
of partially filled pixels along the edges to produce the illusion of a smooth 
edge. You can also get even softer brushes, which employ feathering. For 
details on feathering, see Chapter 7.
The Brush tool shares most of the options found in the Pencil tool, except 
that the Auto Erase feature isn’t available. Here’s the lowdown on the unique 
Brush options:
 
✓ Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the Options bar to apply the 
Airbrush mode. In this mode, the longer you hold down the mouse 
button, the more paint the Brush pumps out and the wider the airbrush 
effect spreads.
 
✓ Tablet Options: Click the down-pointing arrow between the airbrush 
button and the brush icon. If you’re using a pressure-sensitive digital 
drawing tablet, check the settings you want the tablet to control, includ-
ing size, scatter, opacity, roundness, and hue jitter. The harder you press 
with the stylus, the greater the effect of these options.
 
✓ More Options: Click the brush 
icon to access additional 
options. These options, referred 
to as brush dynamics, change 
while you apply your stroke. See 
Figure 12-5 for an example of 
each one. These options include:
 
• Fade: The lower the value, 
the quicker the stroke 
fades. Zero, however, cre-
ates no fade.
 
• Hue Jitter: Vary the stroke 
between the foreground 
and background colors. 
The higher the value, 
the more frequent the 
variation.
 
• Scatter: The higher the 
value, the higher the 
number of brush marks and the farther apart they are.
 
• Spacing: The higher the number, the more space between marks.
 
• Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
• Angle: If you create an oval brush by adjusting the roundness (see 
the following bullet), this option controls the angle of that oval 
brush stroke. It’s so much easier to drag the points and the arrow 
on the diagram than to “guesstimate” values in the text boxes.
 
• Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower 
the percentage, the more elliptical your brush becomes.
 
 You can lock in these brush dynamics by selecting the Keep These 
Settings for All Brushes check box, ensuring that every brush you select 
adopts these settings.
Like the Pencil tool, additional features for the Brush tool appear in the 
pop-up list on the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel. Here’s a quick 
description of each:
 
✓ Save Brush: Allows you to save a custom brush as a preset. See the 
following section for details.
 
✓ Rename Brush: Don’t like your brush’s moniker? Change it with this 
option.
 
✓ Delete Brush: Don’t like your entire brush? Eliminate it with this option.
 
✓ The display options: Not a single command, rather a set of commands 
that enable you to change the way your brush tips are displayed. The 
default view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance of the 
stroke. These commands include Text Only, Small and Large Thumbnail, 
and Small and Large List.
 
✓ Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library to the default.
 
✓ Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library.
 
✓ Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library.
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See 
Chapter 2 for information on using the Preset Manager.
Creating your own brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the Franken-brush 
you’ve created, feel free to save it as a preset that you can access again in the 
future. Choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu on the Brush Preset Picker 
panel. Name the brush and click OK. Your new custom brush shows up at the 
bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
There’s one additional way to create a brush. Elements allows you to create 
a brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or 
something you’ve painted or drawn.

286
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
 
1. Select part of your image with any of the selection tools.
 
 If you want to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
 
 For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
 
 You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
 
3. Name the brush and click OK.
 
 The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker 
drop-down panel. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of 
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color 
you’ve selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
Digital Vision

Using the Impressionist Brush
In this section, we introduce the Impressionist Brush. This tool is designed to 
paint over your photos in a way that makes them look like fine art paintings. 
You can set various options that change the style of the brush strokes.

287
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
 
1. Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a brush with a curlicue next to it. You can also press B, or 
Shift+B, to cycle through the brushes.
 
2. Set your brush options.
 
 The Brushes, Size, Mode, and Opacity options are identical to those 
found with the Brush tool, described in the section “Painting with the 
Brush tool,” earlier in this 
chapter. You can also find some 
unique options on the More 
Options panel, displayed by 
clicking the Impressionist Brush 
icon on the Options bar:
 
• Style: This drop-down list 
contains various brush 
stroke styles, such as Dab 
and Tight Curl.
 
• Area: Controls the size of 
your brush stroke. The 
larger the value, the larger 
the area covered.
 
• Tolerance: Controls how 
similar color pixels have to 
be before they’re changed 
by the brush stroke.
 
3. Drag on your image and paint 
with your brush strokes, as 
shown in Figure 12-7.
 
 The best way to get a feel for 
what this tool does is to open 
your favorite image, grab the 
tool, and take it for a test drive.
Filling and Outlining Selections
There may be times when you want to create an element on your canvas 
that can’t quite be created with a brush or pencil stroke. Maybe it’s a perfect 
circle or a five-point star. If you have a selection, you can fill or stroke that 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-7: The Impressionist Brush turns 
your photo into a painting.

288
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
selection to create that element, rather than draw or paint it on. The Fill com-
mand adds a color or a pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke 
command applies the color to only the edge of the selection border.
Fill ’er up
You won’t find a Fill tool on the Tools panel. Elements decided to avoid the 
overpopulated panel and placed the Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit 
menu. Here are the simple steps to fill a selection:
 
1. Grab the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on a 
new layer.
 
 Although you don’t have to create a new layer to make a selection to fill, 
we recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can 
delete the layer, and your image or background below it remains safe. 
See Chapter 7 for more on selections and Chapter 8 for details on work-
ing with layers.
 
2. Select either the foreground or background color and then choose a 
fill color.
 
 See “Choosing Color,” earlier in this chapter, if you need a refresher.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
 
 The Fill Layer dialog box, shown 
in Figure 12-8, appears.
 
 If you want to bypass the Fill 
Layer dialog box (and the 
rest of these steps), you can 
use these handy keyboard 
shortcuts instead:
 
• To fill the selection with 
the foreground color: 
Press Alt+Backspace 
(Option+Delete on 
the Mac).
 
• To fill it with the back-
ground color: Press 
Ctrl+Backspace (Ô+Delete 
on the Mac).
 
4. Choose your desired fill from the Use pop-up menu.
 
 You can select whether to fill with the foreground or background 
color. You also can choose Color, Black, 50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If 
you select Color, you’re transported to the Color Picker. If you choose 
Figure 12-8: Fill your selection or layer with 
color or a pattern.

289
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Pattern, you must then choose a pattern from the Custom Pattern 
drop-down panel. For more on patterns, see the section “Working with 
Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 
 If you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the command 
says Fill Layer and your entire layer is filled with your color or pattern.
 
5. In the blending area, you can specify whether to preserve transpar-
ency, which enables you to fill only the portions of the selection that 
contain pixels (the nontransparent areas).
 
 Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts 
with colors below it) and opacity percentage, we urge you not to adjust 
your blend mode and opacity in the Fill Layer dialog box. Make those 
adjustments on your layer later by using the Layer panel commands, 
where you have more flexibility for editing.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The color or pattern fills the selection.
Outlining with the Stroke command
Stroking a selection enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of 
selections or layers. You can put this border inside or outside the selection 
border or centered on it. Here are the steps to stroke a selection:
 
1. Choose a foreground color and create a selection.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
 
 The Stroke dialog box opens.
 
3. Select your desired settings.
 
 Many settings are the same as those found in the Fill Layer dialog box, 
as we explain in the preceding section. Here’s a brief rundown of the 
options that are unique to strokes:
 
• Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels 
for the stroke.
 
• Location: Specify how Elements should 
apply the stroke: outside the selection, 
inside the selection, or centered on the 
selection.
 
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
 
 We gave a 30-pixel centered stroke to our 
selection, as shown in Figure 12-9.
Figure 12-9: Stroke a selection 
to create a colored border.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Splashing On Color with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool has been a longtime occu-
pant of the Tools panel. This tool, whose icon 
looks just like a bucket, behaves like a combina-
tion of the Fill command and the Magic Wand 
tool. It makes a selection based on similarly col-
ored pixels and then immediately fills that selec-
tion with color or a pattern. Just like the Magic 
Wand tool, this tool is the most successful when 
you have a limited number of colors, as shown 
in Figure 12-10.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, simply click inside 
the selection you want to fill. Before you click, 
however, specify your options:
 
✓ Fill: Choose between a fill of the foreground 
color or a pattern. If you want to use the 
foreground color, leave Pattern deselected.
 
✓ Pattern: If you select Pattern, select a preset 
pattern from the drop-down panel. For more details on patterns, see the 
section “Working with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Mode: Select a blending mode to change how your fill color interacts 
with the color below it.
 
✓ Opacity: Adjust the opacity to make your fill more or less transparent.
 
✓ Tolerance: Choose a tolerance level that specifies how similar in color 
a pixel must be before it’s selected and then filled. The lower the value, 
the more similar the color must be. For more on tolerance, see the sec-
tion on the Magic Wand in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Anti-alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled 
and unfilled areas.
 
✓ Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are 
touching within your selection. If the option is deselected, pixels are 
selected and filled wherever they lie within your selection.
 
✓ All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels within the selection in all 
layers that are within your tolerance level.
Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color isn’t enough for you, you’ll be pleased to know that Elements 
enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is a 
blend of two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one to another. 
Corbis Digital Stock

tool makes a selection and fills 
it at the same time.

291
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Elements provides a whole slew of various preset gradients. But creating 
your own custom gradient is also fun and easy.
Applying a preset gradient
Similar to colors, patterns, and brushes, gradients have a whole slew of pre-
sets that you can apply to your selection and layers. You can also load other 
libraries of gradients from the Gradient panel pop-up menu.
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
 
1. Make the selection you want to fill with a gradient.
 
 We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can edit 
the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
 
 If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer 
or background.
 
2. Select the Gradient tool from the 
Tools panel or press the G key.
 
3. On the Options bar, click the down-
pointing arrow on the gradient 
swatch to display the Gradient 
Picker drop-down panel and choose 
a preset gradient.
 
 Remember that you can choose 
other preset libraries from the panel 
pop-up menu. Libraries, such as 
Color Harmonies and Metals, contain 
interesting presets.
 
4. Choose your desired gradient type 
by clicking one of the icons.
 
 See Figure 12-11 for an example of 
each type.
 
5. Choose from the following addi-
tional options on the Options bar:
 
• Mode: Select a blending mode 
to change how the color of 
the gradient interacts with the 
colors below it.
 
• Opacity: Specify how opaque or 
transparent the gradient is.
Diamond
Reflected
Angle
Radial
Linear
Figure 12-11: Choose from one of five 
gradient types.

292
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
• Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
 
• Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother 
gradient that prints with less banding (weird stripes caused by 
printing limitations).
 
• Transparency: Deselect this option to make Elements ignore any 
transparent areas in the gradient, making them opaque instead.
 
6. Position your gradient cursor at your desired starting point within 
your selection or layer.
 
7. Drag in any direction to your desired end point for the gradient.
 
 Longer drags result in a subtler transition between colors, whereas 
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Hold down the Shift key 
to restrain the direction of the gradient to multiples of a 45-degree angle.
 
8. Release the mouse button to 
apply the gradient.
 
 We applied an Orange Yellow 
radial gradient from the Color 
Harmonies 2 preset library to 
a selection of a sun in Figure 
12-12. We selected the Reverse 
option and dragged from the 
center of the sun to the tip of 
the top ray.
Customizing gradients
If you can’t find the exact gradient 
you need, you can easily create your 
own. The Gradient Editor lets you 
create your own custom gradient 
using as many colors as you want. 
After you create a custom gradient, you can save it as a preset to reuse in the 
future.
Follow these steps to create a custom gradient:
 
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Click the Edit button (which looks like a gradient swatch) on the 
Options bar.
 
 The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-13.
Figure 12-12: We filled our sun selection with a 
radial Orange Yellow gradient.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
3. Pick an existing 
preset to use as the 
basis for your new 
gradient.
 
4. Choose your gradi-
ent type, either Solid 
or Noise, from the 
pop-up menu.
 
 A Noise gradient 
contains random 
colors. Interestingly, 
each time you create 
a Noise gradient, the 
result is different.
 
 Note that as soon as 
you start to edit the 
existing gradient, the 
name of the gradient 
changes to Custom.
 
5. Choose your options 
for either a Solid 
or Noise gradient, 
depending on what 
you chose in Step 4:
 
• If you chose 
Solid: Adjust 
the Smooth-
ness percent-
age to determine how smoothly one color blends into another.
 
• If you chose Noise: You can choose which Color Model to use to 
set the color range. You can also adjust the Roughness, which 
affects how smoothly or abruptly the color transitions from one to 
another. Click Restrict Colors to avoid oversaturated colors. The 
Add Transparency option adds transparency to random colors. 
Click the Randomize button to randomly generate a new gradient. 
You can then skip to Step 15 to finish the gradient-making process.
 
6. If you’re creating a solid gradient, begin choosing the first color of 
your gradient by clicking the left color stop under the gradient bar. 
(Refer to Figure 12-13.)
 
 The triangle on top of the stop turns black to indicate that you’re work-
ing with the starting point of the gradient.

7. Choose the starting color by double-clicking the left color stop and 
selecting a color from the Color Picker that appears.
 
 In the Stops area, you can also click the color swatch or choose 
Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up menu. If 
you select Color with the Foreground or Background option when you 
change either of those colors, the color in the gradient changes auto-
matically for gradients you make. However, when you open the Gradient 
Editor again, you can revert to your original foreground or background 
color by selecting the User Color option.
 
8. Select the ending color by clicking the right color stop. Repeat Step 7 
to define the color.
 
9. Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other 
by moving the starting or ending point’s color stop to the left or right. 
Drag the midpoint slider (a diamond icon) to adjust where the colors 
mix equally, 50-50.
 
 You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value in the 
Location box.
 
10. To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the position 
you want to add the color. Define a color in the same way you did in 
Steps 7–9.
 
11. Repeat Step 10 to add colors.
 
12. To add transparency to your gradient, select an opacity stop (refer to 
Figure 12-13) and adjust the Opacity slider to specify the amount of 
transparency you desire.
 
 By default, a gradient has colors that are 100-percent opaque. You can 
fade a gradient to transparency so that the portion of the image under 
the gradient shows through.
 
 You can also add additional opacity stops in the same way you add color 
stops.
 
13. Adjust your color and opacity stops and their midpoint sliders to vary 
the percentages of each color.
 
14. You can also redefine any of the colors. To delete a color stop, drag it 
up or down off the gradient bar.
 
15. When you’re done, name your gradient and click the New button.
 
 Your gradient is added to the Presets menu.
 
After all that work, you may want to consider saving your gradients for later 
use. To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog 
box. Save the current presets, with your new gradient, under the current 
library’s name or a new name altogether. You can then later load that preset 
library. You can also manage your gradient presets with the Preset Manager, 
as we explain in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Working with Patterns
If you’ve ever seen someone wearing leopard-print pants with an argyle 
sweater and a plaid blazer, you’re familiar with patterns. Not always pretty 
when used without restraint, patterns can be used to occasionally fill selec-
tions or layers. You can also stamp your image by using the Pattern Stamp 
tool. You can even retouch by using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool. 
Elements offers a lot of preset patterns to keep you happy. And, if you’re not 
happy with Elements’ selection, you can create your own, of course.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter 
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset 
pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the layer or selection you want to fill with a pattern.
 
 Again, we recommend making your selection on a new layer above your 
image for more flexible editing later on.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer and choose Pattern from the 
Use drop-down menu.
 
3. Click the down-pointing 
arrow and select a pattern 
from the Custom Pattern 
drop-down panel, as shown 
in Figure 12-14.
 
 If you don’t see a pattern to 
your liking, choose another 
preset library by clicking the 
panel pop-up menu and choos-
ing another preset library at the 
bottom of the submenu.
 
4. Choose any other fill options 
you want to apply, such as 
Mode, Opacity, or Preserve 
Transparency.
 
 For details on these options, 
see the section “Filling and 
Outlining Selections,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Figure 12-14: Fill your selection with one of the 
many Elements preset patterns.

296
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Creating a new pattern
You may someday want to create your own pattern. Patterns can be easily 
created from any existing photo or painting you create in Elements. You can 
even scan your signature or logo, define it as a pattern, and use it with the 
Pattern Stamp tool to sign all your work.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the photographic, painted, or scanned image that contains the 
area you want to use as a pattern.
 
2. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern.
 
 Make sure that your Feather option is set to 0.
 
 If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire layer as a basis 
for the pattern.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
 
4. Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box that 
appears.
 
 Your new pattern now appears in every Pattern panel, wherever it may 
lurk in Elements.
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a pattern 
with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Chapter 9.
Creating Shapes of All Sorts
In this section, we leave the land of pixels and head into uncharted territory — 
Vectorville. Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a 
little overview that explains the difference between pixels and vectors:
 
✓ Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you 
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to 
look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing 
pixel-based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Chapter 3.
 
✓ Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths 
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are 
math-based, you can resize them without any loss of quality whatsoever.
In Figure 12-15, you can see both types of images.
When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based ele-
ment. Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a 

297
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
shape layer. Use shapes to create simple logos, Web 
buttons, and other small spot illustrations.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for 
you to choose from. Follow these steps to draw a 
shape in your document:
 
1. Choose your desired shape tool from the 
Tools panel.
 
 You can also press Shift+U to cycle through 
the shape tools. All the following tools have 
associated Geometry options, which are 
described in the section “Specifying Geometry 
options,” later in this chapter. Here are the 
tools that are available:
 
• Rectangle and Ellipse: As with their 
Marquee counterparts, you can hold 
down the Shift key while dragging to pro-
duce a square or circle; hold down the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key to draw the 
shape from the center outward.
 
• Rounded Rectangle: This tool works like the regular Rectangle but 
with the addition of a radius value used to round off the corners of 
the rectangle.
 
• Polygon: This tool creates a polygon or star with a specified 
number of sides, from 3 to 100.
 
• Line: This tool draws a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You 
can also add arrowheads at either end.
 
• Custom: Custom is the most varied shape tool. You have numerous 
preset custom shapes to choose from. As with any shape, hold 
down Shift to constrain proportions or Alt (Option on the Mac) to 
draw from the center out.
 
2. In the Options bar, click the down-pointing arrow just to the right of 
the Shape tool icon to specify your Geometry options.
 
 For detailed explanations on the various Geometry options, see the 
upcoming sections.
 
 If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing 
arrow to access the drop-down Shapes panel and choose your desired 
shape. You can access more preset shape libraries via the pop-up menu 
at the top of the panel.
Figure 12-15: Elements 
images can be vector-based 
(top) or pixel-based (bottom).

298
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
3. Select your desired color from the Color drop-down panel on the 
Options bar.
 
 Click the More Colors button (the down-pointing arrow) to access the 
Color Picker for additional color choices.
 
4. Select a style from the Style drop-down 
panel.
 
 To jazz up the shape with bevels and other 
fancy edges, choose a style from the panel. 
For more on styles, see Chapter 11.
 
5. Drag in the document to draw the shape 
you defined.
 
 The shape appears in the image window on 
its own shape layer. Check out the Layers 
panel to see this phenomenon. Figure 12-16 
shows our shape, a Japanese hairstyle, which 
we add to in the following section.
Drawing multiple shapes
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes on that layer. 
You can add, subtract, overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way 
you do with selections. (See Chapter 7.) Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select your desired state button on the Options bar.
 
 You can choose from the following options:
 
• New Shape Layer: Creates your initial shape layer.
 
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins 
two or more shapes.
 
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts 
one shape from another shape.
 
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape 
from only the areas that overlap.
 
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas: 
Creates a shape from only the areas 
that don’t overlap.
 
2. Choose your desired Shape tool and draw 
the next shape.
 
 We completed the shape by adding the face, 
as shown in Figure 12-17.
Figure 12-16: Custom shapes 
run the gamut from the 
ordinary to the exotic, such 
as this hairstyle.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Specifying Geometry options
Geometry options help define how your shapes look. Click the down-pointing 
arrow on the Options bar to access the Geometry options described in the 
sections that follow.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle shapes:
 
✓ Unconstrained: Enables you to have free rein to draw a rectangle at any 
size or shape.
 
✓ Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square.
 
✓ Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles in fixed sizes, as specified by your 
width and height values.
 
✓ Proportional: Allows you to define a proportion for the rectangle. For 
example, specifying 2W and 1H makes a rectangle twice as wide as it 
is high.
 
✓ From Center: Enables you to draw from the center out.
 
✓ Snap to Pixels: Aligns the shape to the pixels on your screen.
 
✓ Radius: For Rounded Rectangles, applies the radius of a circle used to 
round off the corners. Note that this option is found on the Options bar 
itself, not in the Geometry options drop-down menu.
Ellipse Geometry options
The Ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles, except 
for the Snap to Pixels option. The only difference is that, instead of being able 
to create a perfect square, you can create a perfect circle with the Circle option.
Polygon Geometry options
The Geometry options for the Polygon shape are as follows:
 
✓ Radius: Enter the radius of a circle used to round off the corners of a 
polygon when you have the Smooth Corners option selected.
 
✓ Smooth Corners: Round off the corners.
 
✓ Star: Create an inward-pointing polygon called a star.
 
✓ Indent Sides By: Determine the amount the sides indent inward.
 
✓ Smooth Indents: Round off the inner corners of indented sides.
 
✓ Sides: Specify the number of sides for your polygon or the number of 
points for your star.

300
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Line Geometry options
The line’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start 
or end of the line. You can also adjust the width, length, and concavity set-
tings to change the arrowhead shapes.
Custom Shape Geometry options
The Custom Shape options are similar to those you find for the other shapes, 
but with a couple of unique options:
 
✓ Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions 
you used when you created it.
 
✓ Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you 
created it.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes that you create by using a variety of tools and tech-
niques. Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
 
✓ Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in 
their layers. This tool shares a flyout menu with the Shapes tools.
 
✓ Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move the entire contents of 
the shape layer.
 
✓ Delete: Select a shape with the Shape Selection tool and press Delete to 
remove it.
 
✓ Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your 
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and choose your desired 
transformation.
 
✓ Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the 
Layers panel. This action transports you to the Color Picker, where you 
can choose a new color.
 
✓ Clone a shape: Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape 
with the Move tool.
 
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the 
Simplify button on the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note 
that you can’t edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels. 
But you can now apply filters to the layer. See Chapter 11 for more on fun 
with filters.

A
lthough we spout on in this book about how a picture says a thousand 
words, we would be terribly negligent if we didn’t at least give a nod 
to the power of the written word, as well. You may find that you 
never need to go near the type tools. That’s fine. We won’t be 
offended if you skip right past this chapter.
Then again, you may have an occasional need to 
add a caption, a headline, or maybe even a short 
paragraph to an image. Although it’s by no means 
a word-processing or even page-layout program, 
Elements does give you ample tools for creating, 
editing, stylizing, and even distorting type.
Understanding Type Basics
Elements has four type tools. Two of them are for enter-
ing horizontally oriented type, and two are for entering 
vertically oriented type. Don’t worry about the vertical type 
tools. Although you can use them, they’re really designed for the 
Asian market, to enter Chinese and Japanese characters. The horizontal and 
vertical type tools are identical in their attributes, so we just cover the two 

302
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
horizontal type tools from here on, and for the sake of simplicity, we just call 
them the Type and Type Mask tools:
 
✓ Type: Use this tool to enter type. This type is created on its own type 
layer, except when used in Bitmap mode or Indexed Color mode, neither 
of which supports layers.
 
 We refer to layers a lot in this chapter, so if your layer knowledge is 
rusty, check out Chapter 8.
 
✓ Type Mask: This tool doesn’t create actual type; instead, it creates a 
selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selec-
tion border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a type 
selection that you can do with any other selection.
 
 We also talk more about selections in this chapter; for even more detail 
on selections, see Chapter 7.
You can enter text in Elements in two different modes: point type and para-
graph type. Both the Type and Type Mask tools can enter either one. Here’s 
a brief description of each one (for the step-by-step process of creating the 
text, see the following sections):
 
✓ Point: Use this mode if you want to enter only a few words or so. To 
create point type, select the Type tool, click in your image, and, well, 
type. The text appears while you type and continues to grow. In fact, it 
even continues past the boundary of your image! Remember that point 
type never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next line, you 
must press Enter (Return on a Mac).
 
✓ Paragraph: Use this mode to enter longer chunks (or constrained 
blocks) of text on an image. To create paragraph type, click and drag 
your type tool to create a text bounding box and then type. All the text 
is entered in this resizable bounding box. If a line of text is too long, 
Elements automatically wraps it around to the next line.
Elements is capable of displaying and printing type in two different formats. 
Each format has its pros and cons, and which format you use depends on 
your needs. Here’s the lowdown on each one:
 
✓ Vector: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. Vector type 
provides scalable outlines that you can resize without producing jaggy 
edges in the diagonal strokes. Vector type remains fully editable and 
always prints with optimum quality, appearing crisp and clean. Vector 
type is the default type format in Elements.
 
✓ Raster: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, the text is 
rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying. 
When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable but is converted into a 
raster image. You usually simplify your vector type when you want to 

303
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
apply filters to the type to produce a special effect or when you want to 
merge the type with the image. You can’t resize simplified type without 
losing some quality or risking jagged edges. For more details, see the 
section, “Simplifying Type,” later in this chapter.
Creating Point Type
The majority of your type entry will most likely be in point type mode. Point 
type is useful for short chunks of text, such as headlines, labels, logos, and 
headings for Web pages.
Point type is so called because it’s preceded by a single anchor point, which 
marks the starting point of the line of the type. Remember that point-type 
lines don’t wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: Point type doesn’t wrap automatically, but instead can run off your image into a 
type Neverland.
Follow these steps to create point type:
 
1. In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image or create a new, blank 
Elements file (File➪New).
 
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the T key.
 
3. On the image, click where you want to insert your text.
 
 Your cursor is called an I-beam. When you click, you make an insertion 
point.
 
 A small, horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows 
the baseline (the line on which the text sits) for horizontal type.
 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
 
 All the options are described in detail in the section, “Specifying Type 
Options,” later in this chapter.

304
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
5. Type your text and press Enter (Return on a Mac) to begin a new line.
 
 When you press Enter (or Return), you insert a hard return that doesn’t 
move.
 
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit button (the check 
mark icon) on the Options bar.
 
 You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad 
or by clicking any other tool on the Tools panel. A new type layer with 
your text is created. Type layers appear on your Layers panel and are 
indicated by the T icon.
Creating Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, it’s usually more practical to enter the text 
as paragraph type. Entering paragraph type is similar to entering text in a 
word-processing or page-layout program, except that text is contained inside 
a bounding box. When you type and come to the end of the bounding box, 
Elements automatically wraps the text to the next line.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image or create a new, blank 
Elements file.
 
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel or press the T key.
 
3. On the image, insert and size the bounding box by using one of two 
methods:
 
• Drag to create a bounding box close to your desired size. After you 
release the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the 
corners and sides of the box to resize the box.
 
• Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the image. 
The Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact 
dimensions of your desired bounding box. When you click OK, 
your specified box appears, complete with handles for resizing 
later, if necessary.
 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
 
 Options are described in detail in the following section.
 
5. Enter your text; to start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on a Mac).
 
 Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
 
 If you type more text than can squeeze into the text box, an overflow 
icon appears. Just resize the text box by dragging a bounding box handle.

305
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
6. Click the Commit button (the check mark icon) on the Options bar or 
press Enter on the numeric keypad.
 
 Elements creates a new type layer.
Figure 13-2: Paragraph type automatically wraps to fit within your 
bounding box.
Specifying Type Options
You can find several character and 
paragraph type settings on the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 13-3. 
These options enable you to specify 
your type to your liking and pair it 
with your images.
Here’s an explanation of each avail-
able option on the Options bar, from 
left to right:
 
✓ Font Family: Select the font 
you want from the drop-down 
list. Elements provides a 
WYSIWYG (What You See Is 
What You Get) font menu. 
After each font name, the word 
Sample is rendered in the actual 
font — no more selecting a font without knowing what it really looks like. 
Figure 13-3: Specify your type options, such as 
font family and size, before you type.

306
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
You also find one of these abbreviations before each font name to let 
you know what type of font it is:
 
• a: Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
 
• TT: TrueType fonts
 
• O: OpenType fonts
 
 Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
 
✓ Font Style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or 
condensed. Only the styles available for a particular font appear in the 
list. This is also a WYSIWYG menu.
 
✓ Font Size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a 
size in the text box. Note that type size is most commonly measured in 
points (72 points equals about 1 inch at a resolution of 72 ppi). You can 
switch to millimeters or pixels by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and 
Rulers (or on the Mac, Elements➪Preferences➪Units and Rulers).
 
✓ Anti-Aliasing: Select Anti-Aliasing to slightly smooth out the edges of 
your text. Anti-aliasing softens that edge by 1 pixel, as shown in Figure 
13-4. For the most part, you want to keep this option turned on. The one 
occasion in which you may want it turned off is when you’re creating 
small type to be displayed onscreen, such as on Web pages. The soft 
edges can sometimes be tough to read easily.
Anti-aliased
Not anti-aliased

307
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
✓ Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold 
style (which you’d choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be warned 
that although the sky won’t fall, applying faux styles can distort the pro-
portions of a font. You should use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t 
exist, oh, well.
 
✓ Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same 
warning as the Faux Bold option.
 
✓ Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
 
✓ Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to 
your text.
 
✓ Text Alignment: These three options align your horizontal text on the 
left or right, or in the center. If you happen to have vertical text, these 
options rotate 90 degrees clockwise and change into top, bottom, and 
center vertical settings.
 
✓ Leading: Leading (pronounced LED-ing) is the amount of space between the 
baselines of lines of type. A baseline is the imaginary line on which a line of 
type sits. You can choose Auto Leading or specify the amount of leading to 
apply. When you choose Auto Leading, Elements uses a value of 120 percent 
of your type point size. Therefore, 10-point type gets 12 points of leading. 
Elements adds that extra 20 percent so that the bottoms of the lowest let-
ters don’t crash into the tops of the tallest letters on the line below them.
 
✓ Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from 
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches panel.
 
✓ Style: Click this option to access a drop-down panel of preset styles 
that you can apply to your type. For more on this option and the Create 
Warped Text option (described in the following bullet), see “Stylizing 
and Warping Type” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Create Warped Text: This fun option lets you distort type in more than a 
dozen ways.
 
✓ Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer and then click this 
option to switch between vertical and horizontal type orientations.
 
✓ Cancel: Click this button (or press Esc) to cancel and keep the type from 
being entered. Use this option or the Commit option only after you click 
the type tool on your canvas.
 
✓ Commit: Click this button to apply the type to your canvas.
Editing Text
If you read the first part of this chapter and slogged with us through all the 
available options for type in Elements, just remember that you can apply 

308
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
these settings either before or after you enter your text. To correct typos, 
add and delete type, or change any of the type options, simply follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Select your desired type layer on the Layers panel or click within the 
text to automatically select the type layer.
 
3. Do one of the following:
 
• To change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you 
want to change all the text, simply select that type layer on the 
Layers panel. To select only portions of the text, highlight the text 
by dragging across it with the I-beam of the Type tool.
 
• To delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the 
I-beam of the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key (Delete 
on the Mac).
 
• To add text: Make an insertion point by clicking your I-beam within 
the line of text. Then, type your new text.
 
4. When you’re done editing your text, click the Commit button.
 
You may also occasionally need to transform your text. To do so, make sure 
that the type layer is selected on the Layers panel. Then, choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to 
rotate or scale. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle to distort. When 
you’re done, double-click inside the bounding box to commit the transforma-
tion. For more details on transformations, see Chapter 9.
Simplifying Type
As we explain in the section, “Understanding Type Basics,” earlier in this 
chapter, Elements can display and print type in two different formats: vector 
and raster. Remember that as long as you keep type in a vector format in a 
type layer, you can edit and resize that type all day long.
Occasionally, however, you may find the need to simplify your type — to con-
vert your type into pixels. After it’s simplified, you can apply filters, paint on 
the type, and apply gradients and patterns. If you’re working with layers and 
flatten your image (merge your layers into a single background image), your 
type layer is also simplified and merged with the other pixels in your image. 
By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a type layer, Elements barks at you 
that the type layer must be simplified before proceeding and gives you the 
opportunity to click OK (if you want to simplify) or Cancel.

309
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
To simplify your type, select the 
type layer on the Layers panel and 
choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your 
type layer is then converted (the T 
icon disappears) into a regular layer 
on which your type is now displayed 
as pixels against a transparent back-
ground, as shown in Figure 13-5.
 
To avoid re-creating your type 
from scratch, be sure to make all 
necessary edits before simplifying. 
This includes sizing your text. After 
you simplify your type, you can’t 
resize your text without risking the 
dreaded jaggies. The other downside 
to remember about simplified type 
is that although it looks identical to 
vector type onscreen, it never prints 
as crisply and cleanly as vector type. 
Even at higher-resolution settings, a slight jagged edge always appears on 
simplified type. So, if you’re experimenting with painting or filters on your 
type, just make a duplicate of your type layer before simplifying it and then 
hide that layer.
Masking with Type
Using the Type Mask tool epitomizes the combination of type and image. 
Unlike its conventional cousin, the Type Mask tool doesn’t create a new layer. 
Instead, it creates a selection on the active layer. This is the tool of choice 
for filling text with an image or cutting text out of an image so that the back-
ground shows through, as shown in Figure 13-6.
 
A selection is a selection, no matter how it was created. So, even though they 
look like letters, they act like selections. You can move, modify, and save them.
Here are the steps to create a type mask:
 
1. In Edit Full mode, open the image of your choice.
 
 We selected a stone texture.
 
2. Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word 
Background on the Layers panel and then click OK.
 
 This step enables you to jazz up the type with styles later on.

3. Choose the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools panel.
 
4. Specify your type options, such as font family, style, and size, on the 
Options bar.
 
5. Click the image and type your desired text. When you’re done, click 
the Commit button on the Options bar.
 
 A selection border in the shape of your type appears on your image.
 
6. Choose Select➪Inverse, which deselects your letter selections and 
selects everything else.
 
7. Press the Backspace (Delete on a Mac) key to delete everything out-
side your selection border.
 
 Your type is now filled with your image.

311
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
8. Choose Select➪Deselect.
 
9. Experiment with applying layer styles to your type.
 
 If the Effects panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Effects. Select the 
Layer Styles button (second from the left) located in the Effects panel. 
Select the type of Layer Styles you desire from the drop-down list on the 
panel, such as Drop Shadows or Bevels. Finally, double-click the exact 
style you want. We used a drop shadow and an inner bevel in Figure 13-7. 
See Chapter 11 for more layer styles.
 
 If you want to admire your type against a solid background, as we did, 
create a new layer and then choose Edit➪Fill Layer and choose your 
desired color from the Use drop-down menu.

Stylizing and Warping Type
If you tried your hand at creating a type mask in the preceding section, you 
know that Elements is capable of much more than just throwing a few black 
letters at the bottom of your image. With a few clicks here and there, you can 
warp, distort, enhance, and stylize your type. If you’re not careful, your cre-
ative typography can outshine your image.
Adjusting type opacity
If you checked out Chapter 8 before reading this chapter, you know that 
layers are a digital version of the old analog transparency sheets. You can 
change the opacity of elements on layers to enable the underlying layer to 
show through in varying degrees. This is also possible on a type layer. Peek 
at Figure 13-8 to see how varying the percentage of opacity of our type layer 
makes more of the underlying layer of water show through.

312
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
To change the opacity of a 
type layer, simply select the 
layer on the Layers panel, click 
the arrow to the right of the 
Opacity percentage, and drag 
the slider. The lower the per-
centage, the less opaque the 
type (and the more the under-
lying layer shows through).
Applying filters to 
your type
One of the most interesting 
things you can do with type 
in Elements that you can’t do 
in a word-processing or page-
layout program is apply spe-
cial effects, such as filters. You 
can make type look like it’s on 
fire, underwater, or on the move, as shown in Figure 13-9, where we applied 
a motion blur. The only caveat is that type has to be simplified first before a 
filter can be applied. Be sure to do all your text editing before you get to the 
filtering stage. Applying the filter is as easy as just selecting the simplified 
type layer on the Layers panel and choosing a filter from the Filter menu. For 
more on filters, see Chapter 11.

 Chapter 13: Working with Type
Painting your type with color and gradients
Changing the color of text is as easy as high-
lighting it and selecting a color from the Color 
Picker. But what if you want to do something a 
little more unconventional, such as apply brush 
strokes of paint randomly across the type, like we 
did in the top image shown in Figure 13-10? It’s 
really easier than it looks. Again, as with applying 
filters to text, the only criterion is that the type 
has to be simplified first. After that’s done, select 
a color, grab the Brush tool with settings of your 
choice, and paint. In our example, we used the 
Granite Flow brush, found in the Special Effect 
Brushes presets. We used a diameter of 39, 15, 
and 6 pixels and just swiped our type a few times.
 
If you want the color or gradient to be confined 
to only the type area, you can select the text by 
either Ctrl-clicking (Ô-clicking on a Mac) the 
layer containing the text or locking the transparency of the layer on the 
Layers panel.
You can also apply a gradient to your type. Here are the steps to follow after 
simplifying your type:
 
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the down-pointing arrow next to the 
Gradient Picker to access the Gradient Picker drop-down panel.
 
3. Choose your desired gradient.
 
 If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Chapter 12.
 
4. Position your gradient cursor on the text where you want your gradi-
ent to start and drag to where you want your gradient to end.
 
 Don’t like the results? Drag again until you get the look you want. 
Remember that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even out-
side your type. In the bottom image shown in Figure 13-10, we used 
the copper gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the 
bottom. We also locked the transparent pixels on the layer to confine the 
gradient to just the type area.
Figure 13-10: Bring your type to 
life with color (top) or a gradient 
(bottom).

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Warping your type
If horizontal or vertical text is just way too regimented for you, try some of 
the distortions you can apply to your type with the Warp feature. The best 
part about the distortions you apply to the type is that the text remains fully 
editable. This feature is fun and easy to use. Click the Create Warped Text 
button at the far-right end of the Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line 
below it.) This action opens the Warp Text dialog box, where you find a vast 
array of distortions on the Style pop-up menu with descriptive names such as 
Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze.
After selecting a warp style, you can adjust the orientation, amount of bend, 
and degree of distortion by dragging the sliders. The Bend setting affects the 
amount of warp, and the Horizontal and Vertical Distortions apply perspec-
tive to that warp. Luckily, you can also view the results while you adjust. We 
could give you technical explanations of these adjustments, but the best way 
to see what they do is to just play with them. See Figure 13-11 to get a quick 
look at a few of the warp styles. The names speak for themselves.
 
Note that you can also use the Transform command, such as scale and skew, 
to manipulate text. See Chapter 8 for details on transforming.
Figure 13-11: Text remains fully editable after applying distortions with the Warp command.

In this part . . .
T
he focus of this part is photo output and 
deployment. As is the case with so many 
other editing features, you have an abundance of 
opportunities for outputting your fi les. Beginning 
with the most familiar method, which is simply 
printing to your desktop color printer, we talk 
about how to get the best results on your printed 
images. We start with printing to your personal 
desktop printer and then cover issues related to 
submitting photos to commercial photo labs and 
service centers.
In addition to printing, you have a number of dif-
ferent options for sharing images, and they’re all 
covered in the fi nal chapters, where you can fi nd 
out about slide shows and video discs, and about 
Web hosting, e-mailing, and sharing via online ser-
vices. The opportunities are enormous, and you 
may want to look over all that Photoshop 
Elements has to offer related to photo output and 
fi le sharing.

Getting It on Paper
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing files for printing
▶ Working with printer profiles
▶ Using print setups
▶ Looking at other print options
▶ Ordering prints online
P
erhaps the greatest challenge to individuals using programs such as 
Photoshop Elements, and even the professionals who use its grand-
daddy, Adobe Photoshop, is getting what you see on your monitor to render 
a reasonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books on 
color printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your equip-
ment, and how to create and use color profiles — all for the 
purpose of getting a good match between your computer 
monitor, your printer, and the paper used to print your 
output. It’s downright discouraging to spend a lot of 
time tweaking an image so that all the brilliant blue 
colors jump out on your computer monitor, only to 
find that all those blues turn to murky purples when 
the photo is printed.
If you already read Chapters 2 and 3, you’re ahead 
of the game because you know a little bit about 
color management, color profiles, and printer reso-
lutions. After you check out those chapters, your 
next step is to get to know your printer and under-
stand how to correctly print your pictures.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many options — for 
setting print attributes for printing to your own color printer. If you 
need to, reread this chapter a few times just to be certain that you under-
stand the process for printing good-quality images. A little time spent here 
will, we hope, save you some headaches down the road.

318
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Getting Pictures Ready for Printing
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer is to pre-
pare each image for optimum output. You have several considerations when 
you’re preparing files, including the ones in this list:
 
✓ Set resolution and size. See your printer’s documentation for recom-
mendations for resolution. As a general rule, 200-300 ppi (pixels per inch) 
works best for most printers printing on high-quality paper. If you print 
on plain paper, you often find that lower resolutions work just as well or 
even better. Chapter 3 explains setting size and resolution in detail.
 
✓ Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. Make sure 
that your pictures appear their best before sending them off to your 
printer. If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we discuss in 
Chapter 2, you should see a fair representation of what your pictures will 
look like before you print them. Chapters 9 and 10 cover corrections.
 
✓ Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next 
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you 
start to print your files.
 
✓ Get your printer ready. Finally, when printing to desktop color printers 
always be certain your ink cartridges have ink and the nozzles are clean. 
Make sure you use the proper settings for paper and ink when you send 
a file to your printer. Be sure to review the manual that came with your 
printer to become aware of how to perform all the steps required to 
make a quality print.
Working with Color Printer Profiles
In Chapter 2, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor and 
selecting a color workspace. The final leg in a color-managed workflow is to 
convert color from your color workspace profile to your printer’s color pro-
file. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you see on your monitor 
in your current workspace are accurately converted to the color that can be 
reproduced by your printer. To print accurate color, you need to have a color 
profile designed for your printer and the paper you use installed on your 
computer.
You can manage color in Photoshop Elements in three ways when it comes 
time to print your files:
 
✓ Printer Manages Colors: This method permits your printer to decide 
which profile is used when your photo is printed to your desktop color 
printer. Your printer makes this decision according to the paper you 
select as the source paper used to print your photos. If you choose 

319
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your printer chooses 
the profile that goes along with that particular paper. If you choose 
another paper, your printer chooses a different color profile. This 
method is all automatic, and color profile selection is made when you 
print your file.
 
✓ Photoshop Elements Manages Color: When you make this choice, color 
management is taken out of the hands of your printer and is controlled 
by Elements. You must choose a color profile after making this choice. 
If color profiles are installed by your printer, you can choose a color 
profile from the list of profiles that match your printer and the paper 
source. 
 
✓ No Color Management: You use this choice if you have a color profile 
embedded in one of your pictures. You’ll probably rarely use this option. 
Unless you know how to embed profiles or receive files with embedded 
profiles from other users, don’t make this choice in the Print dialog box. 
Because very few Elements users work with files with embedded pro-
files, we’ll skip coverage on this method of printing your files.
Each of these three options requires you to make a choice about how color 
is managed. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chapter, when we 
walk you through the steps for printing) about whether to color-manage your 
output. These selections are unique to the Print dialog box and more specifi-
cally in the More Options dialog box for your individual printer.
 
Color profiles are also dependent upon the ink being used, and refilling 
cartridges with generic ink can (in some cases) result in colors shifting. 
Similarly, if the nozzles aren’t clean and delivering ink inconsistently, you 
may see some very strange results.
Printing a photo with the printer managing color
Without going into all the settings you have to choose from in the Print and 
More Options dialog boxes; for now, let’s just look at printing a photo and 
managing color. We explain more print options available to you later in this 
chapter, in the section “Setting Print Options.”
For the following example, we use an Epson printer. If you have a different 
printer, some of the dialog boxes and terms may appear different. With a little 
careful examination of the printer driver dialog box, you should be able to 
apply the following steps for any printer:
 
1. Choose File➪Print with a photo open in Edit Full mode.
 
 The Print dialog box that opens contains all the settings you need to 
print a file (see Figure 14-11 later in this chapter for a screen reference of 
the Print dialog box).

320
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
2. Click Page Setup at the bottom 
of the Print dialog box and 
select the orientation of your 
print. Click OK.
 
 Your choices are either Portrait 
or Landscape, as shown in 
Figure 14-1. After you click 
OK, you return to the Print 
dialog box.
 
3. Choose your printer from the 
Printer drop-down menu.
 
4. Set the print attributes.
 
 Select the number of copies, 
position, scaling, and output 
items you want.
 
5. Click More Options and choose 
Color Management in the More 
Options dialog box. 
 
 In the Color Management area, shown in Figure 14-2, make your choices 
for how to manage color when you print files.
 
6. From the Color Handling drop-down menu, select Printer Manages 
Color. Click OK.
 
 This choice uses your current workspace color [either sRGB or Adobe 
RGB (1998)] and later converts the color from your workspace to the 
printer output file when you open the printer driver dialog box. 
Figure 14-2: Look over the Color Management area in the More Options 
dialog box for options on how to manage color.
Figure 14-1: Click Page Setup and choose either 
Portrait or Landscape.

321
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
7. Click Print in the Print dialog box, and follow the steps for Windows 
or Mac OS X, whichever you use.
 
 The file doesn’t print yet. 
 
• In Windows, first, the Windows system Print dialog box opens. 
Click Preferences and the Printing Preferences dialog box for your 
printer driver opens as shown in Figure 14-3. Proceed to Step 8.
 
• On the Macintosh, the OSX 
System Print dialog box 
opens. You need to make 
two choices here. Open 
the drop-down menu 
below the Pages item in 
the Print dialog box and 
choose Print Settings as 
shown in Figure 14-4. From 
the Media Type drop-down 
menu, choose the paper 
for your output.
 
 The second choice 
Macintosh users need 
to make is the selection 
for Color Management. 
Open the Print Settings 
drop-down menu and 
choose Color Management 
as shown in Figure 14-5. 
Leave the default setting at 
Color Controls (this setting 
is used when the printer 
manages color). On the 
Macintosh, click Print and 
the file is printed.
 
8. Set print attributes (Windows).
 
 In our Epson example, select 
a paper type such as Epson 
Premium Glossy (or another 
paper from the Type drop-down 
list that you may be using) and 
then click the Best Photo radio 
button. (Refer to Figure 14-3.)
Figure 14-3: Click Preferences in the first 
dialog box that opens, and the selected printer 
preferences opens.
Figure 14-4: Choose Print Settings on the 
Macintosh and make a choice for the paper 
you use for the output.

322
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 Now, it’s time to color-manage 
your file. This step is critical in 
your print-production workflow.
 
9. Click the Advanced button and 
then, in the Warning dialog 
box that appears, simply click 
Continue (Windows).
 
 The Printing Preferences dialog 
box opens, displaying advanced 
settings, as shown in Figure 14-6.
 
10. Make your choices in the 
advanced Printing Preferences 
dialog box (Windows).
 
 Here are the most important 
choices:
 
• Select a paper type. You 
selected paper already? 
The second drop-down 
menu in the Paper & 
Quality section of the 
dialog box determines the 
application of inks. Choose 
the same paper here as 
you did in Step 8.
 
• Turn on color management. 
Because you’re letting the 
printer driver determine 
the color, you need to 
be certain that the Color 
Controls radio button is 
active. This setting tells 
the printer driver to auto-
matically select a printer 
profile for the paper type you selected.
 
• Set the color mode. Don’t use Epson Vivid. This choice produces 
inferior results on photos. Choose Best Photo, the Epson Standard, 
or Adobe RGB, depending on your printer. 
 
 If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your 
settings by clicking the Save Setting button.
Figure 14-6: Click Advanced and then click 
Continue to access the advanced settings in 
the Epson printer driver.
Figure 14-5: Choose Color Management, and 
make sure Color Controls is selected.

323
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
11. To print the photo, click OK and then OK again in the Print dialog 
box (Windows).
 
 Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically 
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile 
the printer driver automatically selects for you.
Printing a photo with Elements managing color
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select 
a printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your 
printer. Whereas in the preceding section, you used your printer to manage 
color, this time, you let Photoshop Elements manage the color.
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described in the preceding 
section for printing files for automatic profile selection when you’re setting 
up the page and selecting a printer. When you choose File➪Print, you open 
the Elements Print dialog box. To let Elements handle the color conversion, 
follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
 
1. Choose File➪Print. Click More Options to open the More Options 
dialog box. Click Color Management in the left pane to display the 
color management options.
 
2. From the Printer Profile drop-down menu, select the color profile 
designed for use with the paper you’ve chosen.
 
 In this example, we use a 
heavyweight-matte-paper color 
profile, as shown in Figure 14-7. 
(Note that custom color profiles 
you acquire from a profiling ser-
vice come with recommended 
color-rendering intents. For this 
paper, Relative Colorimetric is 
recommended and is selected 
on the Rendering Intent drop-
down menu, as you can see in 
Figure 14-7.)
 
3. Click Print.
 
 The second Print dialog box opens.
 
4. Click the Properties button.
 
 You arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 14-3. On the 
Macintosh you arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-7: Choose a printer profile that 
matches the paper you use.

324
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
5. Click the Best Photo radio button. From the Type drop-down list, 
select the recommended paper choice. On the Macintosh you make 
your paper choice as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
 Custom color profiles are also shipped with guidelines for selecting 
proper paper.
 
6. Click Advanced and click Continue to arrive at the same dialog box 
shown earlier in Figure 14-6. On the Macintosh you choose Color 
Management from the drop-down menu to arrive at the same dialog 
box shown in Figure 14-5.
 
 The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the previ-
ous Properties dialog box (see Step 2 in the preceding section). The one 
setting you change is in the Color Management section.
 
7. Click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button and check 
Off (No Color Adjustment) as 
shown in Figure 14-8. On the 
Macintosh, click the Off (No 
Color Adjustment) radio button 
(refer to Figure 14-5). 
 
 Because you selected the color 
profile in Step 1 and you’re 
letting Elements manage 
the color, be sure the Color 
Management feature is turned 
off. If you don’t turn off Color 
Management, you end up 
double-profiling your print.
 
Deciding to manage color or not manage color is simplified in Photoshop 
Elements. In the Color Management area of the dialog box, a message is 
reported each time you make a selection from the Color Handling drop-down 
menu. Right below Rendering Intent, you see a message asking if you remem-
bered to turn Color Management on or off. Each time you make a selection 
for the Color Handling, pause a moment and read the message (shown in 
Figure 14-7). This is your reminder that you need to follow the recommenda-
tion to properly handle color.
Each time you print a file — whether it be a single photo, a contact sheet, 
a photo package or other type of print — you use the same steps for color 
management. In the next section we talk about a number of different options 
you have for printing photos, but remember that you need to manage the 
color for each type of print you want.
Figure 14-8: Click ICM and click Off (No Color 
Adjustment).

 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
Setting Print Options
You print files from Elements using the File➪Print command. Depending on 
what workspace you have open, you can set print options in the Print dialog 
box from the Organizer (Windows) or from within Edit Full mode. Adobe 
Bridge doesn’t have a File➪Print command; on the Mac all printing is handled 
in the Elements Edit Full mode. The different modes provide you with some 
different options, so we want to look at printing from both the Organizer on 
Windows and Edit Full mode on Windows and the Macintosh.
On the Mac, you have a few printing options from within Adobe Bridge, but 
they are limited to printing Contact Sheets and Picture Packages. When you 
choose options for Contact Sheets and Picture Packages in Adobe Bridge, the 
files are created and opened in Edit Full mode.
Printing from the Organizer (Windows)
You can select one or more images in the Organizer (Windows) and then 
choose File➪Print. The images selected when you choose the Print com-
mand appear in a scrollable list, as shown in Figure 14-9. On the Macintosh all 
photos that open in Edit Full mode appear in a similar scrollable list as shown 
in Figure 14-10. Options you have in the Print Photos dialog box include:
 
A. Image Thumbnails: When you select multiple images in the Organizer, 
all the selected images appear in a scrollable window on the left side of 
the dialog box.
 
B. Scroll bar: When so many photos are selected that they all cannot be 
viewed in the thumbnail list on the left side of the dialog box, you can 
use the scroll bar to see all images.
 
C. Add/Remove: If the Print Photos dialog box is open and you want to add 
more photos to print, click the Add (+) icon and the Add Photos dialog 
box opens. A list of thumbnails appears, showing all photos in the cur-
rent open catalog. Check the check boxes adjacent to the thumbnails to 
indicate the photos you want to add to your print queue. You can also 
choose an entire catalog, albums, photos marked with keyword tags, and 
photos having a rating.
 
 If you want to remove photos from the list to be printed, click the photo 
in the scrollable list in the Print Photos dialog box and click the Remove 
(-) icon.

Using More Options
When printing photos from the Organizer, click the More Options button in 
the Print Photos dialog box. The More Options dialog box opens (refer to 
Figure 14-2).
If you’ve used Photoshop Elements prior to version 8, notice that the More 
Options dialog box has changed. As shown in Figure 14-2, you have three 
categories listed in the left pane. The three items are as follows:
 
✓ Printing Choices: Similar to what was available in earlier versions of 
Elements
 
✓ Custom Print Size: Various settings for the output size
 
✓ Color Management: Handles color profile selection and color manage-
ment options 
These three items have been moved from the Print dialog box to the More 
Options dialog box.
 
When you want to manage color in Elements 8, as we explained earlier in the 
section “Working with Color Printer Profiles,” you need to open the More 
Options dialog box.
The default selection is Printing Choices when you open the More Options 
dialog box. Choices available for printing your photos include
 
✓ Photo Details: Check the check boxes for the detail items you want 
printed as labels on your output.
 
✓ Layout: If you want one photo printed per page, check this box.
 
✓ Flip Image: This option is used for heat transfer material: Mylar, Lexjet, 
and other substrates that require E-down printing — emulsion-down 
printing, where the negative and the image are flipped.
 
✓ Border: Check Add a Border, and you can specify the size of the border 
in the check box and choose a unit of measure in the drop-down list. 
Click the Color swatch to choose a color for the border. Check Include 
Trim Guideline to print guides for trimming the paper.
 
✓ Print Crop Marks: Check this box to print crop marks.
Printing from Edit Full mode
If you want to print a photo while in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Print and the 
Print dialog box opens. The Print dialog box in Edit Full mode in Elements 8 is 
identical to the Print dialog box you use when printing from the Organizer. 

329
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
On the Macintosh you find the same settings (see Figure 14-10) as Windows 
with the exception of the Printer Settings options and Select Type of Prints 
drop-down menu. Printer Settings are handled in the More Options dialog box 
on the Mac, and you make the Type of Print choices for Contact Sheets and 
Picture Packages from within Adobe Bridge.
Exploring Other Print Options
The basic principles of color management are used each time you print a 
file to your printer. Up to this point, we talk about printing a single photo. 
Elements provides you with a variety of other choices for printing files with-
out borders, with a number of different choices for printing photos with 
decorative frames, picture packages, and contact sheets.
You have choices in the Organizer or Edit Full mode (Windows) or Adobe 
Bridge (Macintosh) for choosing a command for printing multiple images 
as either a contact sheet or picture package. On Windows, from within Edit 
Full mode, when you choose to print a contact sheet or picture package, 
Elements switches you to the Organizer view. You continue as an action from 
the Organizer and leave Edit Full mode. On the Macintosh you make the same 
choices from within Adobe Bridge; after you make the choice, your view is 
changed to Edit Full mode.
Printing contact sheets
Professional photographers use contact sheets to organize photos and to 
preview the images before ordering final prints. If you have several shots of 
a single subject, you may want to see a hard copy of the photos before print-
ing full sizes. Additionally, you can print contact sheets to keep albums of 
thumbnail images organized in a book without having to preview images in 
the Organizer or Adobe Bridge.
To print a contact sheet, do the following:
 
1. Open the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh).
 
2. In the Organizer/Bridge select photos you want to print on a contact 
sheet.
 
 Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Macintosh) to choose multiple photos in a non-
contiguous selection. You can also sort photos by keyword tags, albums, 
dates, and so on. You then select all the sorted photos by pressing Ctrl+A. 
For more information on sorting files, see Chapter 5. For more information 
on creating albums and using keyword tags, see Chapter 6.
 
3. Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P (Windows). On the Macintosh 
choose Tools➪Photoshop Elements in Adobe Bridge.

330
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 The Print Photos dialog box opens (Windows). In the dialog box select 
the printer you want to use for your output from the Select Printer drop-
down list.
 
 On the Macintosh the Contact Sheet is assembled for you. After 
Elements finishes the assembly, the contact sheet document appears as 
an image file in Edit Full mode. Choose File➪Print or press Ô+P.
 
4. Choose Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print drop-down menu 
(Windows). 
 
 The Prints dialog box refreshes to show your Contact Sheet options, as 
shown in Figure 14-11.
Figure 14-11: Choose Contact Sheet and select a layout for the number of columns.
 
5. Select a layout. 
 
 Choose the number of columns you want for the contact sheet. If you 
specify fewer columns, the images appear larger; as more columns are 
selected, the images appear smaller. Choose a size according to the 
number of columns that you want to print.
 
6. Check the boxes for the items you want included in the captions.

331
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
 If you want print options to be shown on your prints, check the Show 
Print Options check box, and the list of options are displayed below the 
check box. Caption items can include the date, a text line for the cap-
tion, filename, and page numbers.
 
7. Click More Options in the bottom left of the dialog box.
 
 Choose a color profile from the Print Space drop-down list. For more on 
printing with color profiles, see the section “Working with Color Printer 
Profiles” earlier in this chapter.
 
8. Click OK in the More Options dialog box.
 
9. Click Print (back in the Print Photos dialog box) to print your contact 
sheet.
Printing picture packages
Another option you have for printing multiple photos is picture packages. 
This feature prints multiple copies of the same photo or multiple copies of 
many photos. 
A picture package is typically a single sheet of paper with the same photo 
printed at different sizes — something like your graduation photos or prom 
photos. You can choose to print a single picture package from one photo 
selected in the Organizer, or you can select multiple photos and print them 
all as multiple picture packages.
To create a picture package, do the following:
 
1. Open the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh).
 
2. In the Organizer Bridge select a single photo or multiple photos that 
you want to print as a picture package(s).
 
3. Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P Windows. On the Macintosh choose 
Tools➪Photoshop Elements➪Picture Package.
 
 The Print Photos dialog box opens. In the dialog box, select the printer 
you want to use for your output from the Select Printer drop-down list.
 
 On the Macintosh the Picture Package is assembled for you. After 
Elements finishes the assembly, choose File➪Print or press Ô+P.
 
4. Choose Picture Package from the Select Type of Print drop-down list.
 
 The Print Photos dialog box refreshes to show your Picture Package 
options.
 
5. Choose a layout.
 
 Choose a layout from the Select a Layout drop-down menu. As you make 
layout selections, you see a dynamic preview of the picture package as 
shown in Figure 14-12. Select different layouts to examine the results and 
choose the layout you want for your picture package.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Figure 14-12: Choose Picture Package and select a layout for the package.
Using Online Printing Services (Windows)
Photoshop Elements supports on Windows the Adobe Photoshop Services 
program, which is a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Adobe Partners. 
Adobe Photoshop Services are not available from Adobe Bridge on the 
Macintosh. The Services program offers online ordering of prints and sharing 
of photos and projects, and it has a huge array of different print products for 
consumers and professionals.
On the Macintosh you can access a service such as Kodak EasyShare and 
upload photos apart from Elements. On Windows, you have a direct link to 
the service from within Elements.
To use the Kodak EasyShare Service for online printing of your photos, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select files in the Organizer much as you’d select files for printing.

333
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
2. In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints. 
Alternatively, you can click the Share tab in the Panel Bin and click 
the Order Prints button.
 
 The Kodak EasyShare 
Wizard opens, as shown 
in Figure 4-13. The first 
screen shown in the 
wizard is a form for you to 
create an account.
 
 If you try to place an order 
from your office where the 
IT department prevents 
you from connecting to 
some external sources, 
you may need to have your 
firewall settings adjusted. 
Talk to someone in your IT 
department to help you 
make a connection.
 
3. If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and 
step through the wizard by clicking the 
Next button on each page. If you have set up an account, supply your 
logon information.
 
 The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of 
the wizard’s order page.
 
4. You can modify your order by deleting files from the order and speci-
fying different print sizes and quantities.
 
 One nice feature in the service is the option to send duplicate prints to 
another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web site 
and specify whom you want to receive an order. This feature is helpful if 
you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean cruise 
and want to send photos of the great time you’re having to all your kids. 
Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load the digital camera 
images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you return to 
Buffalo in midwinter with a suntan, your kids will frown as they fan 
through the prints they received a week earlier.
 
5. Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and con-
firm your order, click the Finish button on the last pane, and your 
order is complete.

▶ Creating instant videos
▶ Burning CDs and DVDs
▶ Creating files for Web viewing
▶ Flipping photos
E
lements is a great packaging tool that you can use to deploy your 
photos and projects for screen viewing. And that’s not just your com-
puter monitor. You can edit photos or assemble creations that are exported 
for Web viewing, too, and you can even prepare files to show on 
your television.
In Chapter 3, you can find out about resolutions and 
color modes. The output requirements for printing 
files, which we cover in Chapter 14, are much differ-
ent from what you use for screen viewing.
In this chapter, we cover the options for Web and 
screen viewing that get you started with basics, 
including saving images for the Web (or for screen 
viewing), setting up a slide show, and burning your 
images on CDs or DVDs.
Getting Familiar with the Elements 
Sharing and Printing Options
Before we delve into telling you how to make creations for screen viewing, you 
should be familiar with your available options for not only screen images, but 
also sharing and printing. The Create and Share panels are available in both 

336
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Edit Full and Edit Quick modes. Options available to you in the panels are 
identical in each editing space. If you’re using a Windows computer, you can 
also find these options via the Organizer: When you open the Organizer and 
look at the Panels Bin, you see two tabs on the right side at the top of the bin 
for Create and Share. Figure 15-1 shows the menu options for the respective 
items.
Figure 15-1: Two panels provide a number of different sharing and 
photo creation options.
 
✓ Create: The Create tab contains options for creating different kinds of 
projects, such as photo books, photo calendars, greeting cards, photo 
prints, photo collages, slide shows, instant movies, and photo stamps.
 
 On the Macintosh you have fewer choices. You won’t find options for 
creating Photo Calendars, Instant Movies, or PhotoStamps.
 
✓ Share: The Share tab provides a number of different options for shar-
ing photos. On this tab, you find options for developing online photo 
albums, e-mailing photos, sending photo mails, writing files to CD/DVDs, 
sharing online videos, and exporting photos to mobile phones.

337
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
 Again, the Macintosh version of Elements is more limited in Sharing 
options. You don’t have settings for Online Albums, Photo Mail, Burn 
DVD/Blu Ray, Online Video Sharing, and Mobile Phones and Players. You 
do have an option for Web Photo Gallery in the Share panel that is avail-
able on Windows in the Create panel.
 
Note that each panel contains a More Options button. Click the button to find 
more creation and sharing options.
In Chapter 14, we talk about ordering online prints by using the Order Prints 
option on the Share panel. In this chapter and in Chapter 16, we cover vari-
ous commands on the Create panel and other options on the Share panel.
Creating a Slide Show
This Million Dollar Baby is no Mystic River — it’s simply Absolute Power! 
Well, maybe you won’t travel the same path from Rowdy Yates to multiple 
Academy Award–winning director and filmmaker Clint Eastwood, but even 
Mr. Eastwood might be impressed with the options for movie making with 
the Photoshop Elements slide show creations. When he’s not rolling out his 
Panaflex camera, he may just want to take photos of the grandkids and do the 
directing and producing, as well as the editing, right in Photoshop Elements.
For the rest of us, we can be our own Clint Eastwood wannabes by using the 
powerful features of the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor to create PDF 
slide shows and movie files. It’s so easy that Elements promises you won’t be 
Unforgiven.
Creating a project
You create a project file in the Slide Show Editor and then export it for a 
number of different uses. In this section, you can find out how to create and 
save your project. In the following section, you dive into exporting.
On the Macintosh, you create slide shows as PDF documents that can be 
saved as PDF for screen viewing and printing. Creating a PDF slide show 
on the Macintosh can be initiated in either Edit Full mode or from within 
Adobe Bridge. If you begin in Edit Full mode on the Macintosh and click PDF 
Slideshow in either the Create or Share panel, you are immediately switched 
to Adobe Bridge. In Bridge you select the photos you want to appear in the 
slide show and make choices for output and transitions. You complete the 
process by saving the file as a PDF document.

338
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
In Windows, you create a Photoshop Elements project. A project has an advan-
tage over a PDF document in regard to revising the content. On the Macintosh, 
after you create a PDF slide show, you need to create a completely new slide 
show if you want to add or delete photos from the file. In Windows, you can 
simply open your project, make revisions, and produce the slide show. 
For Windows users, here’s how you go about creating a slide show project 
that you can edit and export later:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the pictures you want to use in your 
slide show.
 
2. Click the Create button in the Panels Bin and click Slide Show.
 
 The Slide Show Preferences dialog box opens. Just about everything in the 
dialog box can be adjusted in the Slide Show Editor, so don’t worry about 
making choices here. If you want to keep the Slide Show Preferences 
dialog box from reappearing when you make slide creations, deselect the 
Show This Dialog Each Time a New Slide Show Is Created check box.
 
3. Click OK in the Slide Show Preferences dialog box.
 
 The Slide Show Editor opens, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2: The Slide Show Editor is where you create slide shows.

339
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
4. If your Slide Show Editor doesn’t show you a screen similar to the one 
shown in Figure 15-2, maximize the window by clicking the Maximize 
button in the upper-right corner of the window.
 
 This way, you can see the Storyboard at the bottom of the screen and 
the Panels Bin on the right side of the editor.
 
5. (Optional) Create a Pan & Zoom view.
 
 When slides are shown, you can zoom and pan a slide. Click the Enable 
Pan & Zoom check box and click the Start thumbnail. A rectangle appears 
in the preview area. Move any one of the four corner handles in or out to 
resize the rectangle. Moving the cursor inside the rectangle and clicking 
the mouse button enables you to move the rectangle around the preview.
 
 For the end zoom position, click the End thumbnail and size the rectan-
gle to a zoomed view or a view that you want to stop the zoom. Notice in 
Figure 15-2 that the End thumbnail is selected and the rectangle is sized 
down to the zoom area on a portion of the photo.
 
6. (Optional) Add a graphic.
 
 A library of graphics appears on the Extras pane in the Panels Bin. Drag 
a graphic to a slide. If you want a blank slide to appear first and then 
add text and graphics to the blank slide, click Add Blank Slide on the 
Shortcuts bar at the top of the Editor.
 
7. (Optional) Add text.
 
 Click the Text tool on the Extras pane in the Panels Bin, and drag a text 
style to the blank slide or the opening slide in the slide show. After you 
drag text to a slide, the Properties pane opens in the Panels Bin. The text 
you drag to the slide is placeholder text. To edit the text, click Edit Text 
in the Properties pane. You can also select a font, a font size, a color 
for the text, text alignment, and a font style. After setting the type attri-
butes, click inside the text and move it to the position you want.
 
8. (Optional) Set transitions.
 
 The icons between the slides in the Storyboard (at the bottom of the 
Slide Show Editor) indicate a default transition applied to the slide show. 
You can change transition effects for each slide independently or to all 
the slides in the show. Click the right-pointing arrow on the right side of 
a transition icon to open a pop-up menu containing a number of different 
transitions, as shown in Figure 15-3. If you want to apply the same transi-
tion to all slides, choose Apply to All at the top of the menu commands.
 
 Be conservative with the transition effects. Too many transitions of dif-
ferent types can make the slide show appear amateurish and distracting 
to the viewers.
 
9. (Optional) Add audio and media.
 
 You can add audio to the slide show by choosing Add Media➪Audio 
from Organizer (or from Folder). Select an audio file and click OK.

340
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 You can also add movie files to your slide 
show. A movie file can be added on top of a 
slide or on a new slide. When the slide show 
is played, the video file plays. Choose Add 
Media➪Photos and Videos from Organizer 
(or from Folder).
 
 This same set of commands can also be used 
to add more pictures to the slide show.
 
10. (Optional) Record your own sounds.
 
 If you want to add narration, click the 
Narration tool (represented by a micro-
phone icon to the right of the Text tool) in 
the Panels Bin, and the Extras panel changes 
to provide you with tools to record a sound 
or import a sound file. Note that this option 
requires you to have a microphone properly 
configured on your computer.
 
11. (Optional) Fit slides to the audio.
 
 If you have 3 minutes of audio and the slide 
duration is 2 minutes 30 seconds, you can, 
with a single mouse click, fit the slide dura-
tion uniformly to fit the 3-minute audio time. 
Just click the Fit Slides to Audio tool below 
the preview image.
 
 If you want to manually adjust time for slide 
durations, click the down arrow on the time 
readout below the slide thumbnails in the 
Storyboard.
 
12. Click Save Project on the Shortcuts bar and 
then, in the dialog box that opens, type a 
name and click Save.
 
 Your project is added to the Organizer and is available for further edit-
ing later. Or, you can open the project to save in a number of different 
output formats, as we explain in the following section.
 
13. Preview the slide show.
 
 Before exporting the slide show, you can see a preview by clicking the 
buttons directly below the image preview area. If you want a full-screen 
preview, click the Preview button on the Shortcuts bar and click the Play 
button.
Figure 15-3: Click a right-
pointing arrow on a transition 
to open the Transitions pop-up 
menu.

 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
We haven’t exported the slides yet to a file. We just saved the project that 
you can reopen and edit. To create the slide show file, look over the next 
section, “Exporting to slides and video.”
 
If you don’t like the order of the slides when you open the Slide Show 
Editor, you can easily reorder the slides by dragging back and forth along 
the timeline.
Exporting to slides and video
After creating a project, you have a number of different output options. You 
can write a project to disc for archival purposes and include slide shows on 
a VideoCD (videodisc) or DVD. You can e-mail a slide show to another user, 
share a project online, write a project compatible for display on a TV, or save 
to either a PDF slide show or Windows movie file.
To write a PDF slide show or a movie file, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer window, double-click the project thumbnail. On the 
Macintosh, click PDF Slideshow in the Create or Share Panel in Edit 
Full mode or Adobe Bridge.
 
 The project opens in the Adobe Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor 
(Windows).
 
2. Click the Output tool on the Shortcuts bar or Output to Web or PDF in 
Adobe Bridge.
 
 The Slide Show Output Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 15-4 on 
Windows.
Figure 15-4: Select Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show 
Editor to open the Slide Show Output Wizard.

342
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 On the Macintosh, you choose Output to Web or PDF in Adobe Bridge as 
shown in Figure 15-5. You can choose a template for the slide appearance 
from the Template drop-down menu and make choices for page size and 
playback options including slide transitions within the Output pane.
 
3. Select the type of file you want export (Windows).
 
• Movie File (.wmv): Select this option to export a Windows media 
video file. Your exported video can be viewed in Elements or in the 
Windows Media Player. You can import the video in all programs 
that support .wmv files.
 
• PDF File (.pdf): Select this option if you want to create a PDF slide 
show. If you create a PDF slide show, some of the animation fea-
tures, such as zooming slides and transition effects, aren’t shown 
in the resultant PDF document. The advantage, however, for 
exporting to PDF is that both Macintosh and Windows users can 
view the slide show using the free Adobe Reader software.
 
 On the Macintosh, scroll the Output tab to the bottom of the pane and 
click Save. If you have the View PDF After Save check box checked as 
shown in Figure 15-6, the file opens in Adobe Reader. Your slide show is 
now ready for sharing or printing.
Figure 15-5: Click Output to Web or PDF and then click PDF in the Output tab in Adobe Bridge 
on the Macintosh.

4. In the dialog box that opens, which prompts you to add your output 
file to the Organizer, click Yes (Windows).
 
 You can now easily view the file by double-clicking it in the Organizer 
window.
Creating an Instant Video (Windows)
Photoshop Elements is not a 
video editor. You can create some 
video files and import video in 
the Organizer. However, when it 
comes to editing video, you need 
another application. The applica-
tion that works very well in tandem 
with Elements is Adobe Premiere 
Elements. Unfortunately, as this 
book goes to press, Premiere 
Elements is only available to 
Windows users. On the Macintosh 
you can use Apple’s iMovie.
 
On the Create panel, you find a 
selection for Instant Movie. When you 
click this button, the Ready to Edit 
dialog box shown in Figure 15-7 
opens. It describes how to acquire a 
trial version of Adobe Premiere 
Elements. 
Click the Download Trial button, and 
the trial version of Adobe Premiere 
Elements commences a download. 
You can use the program for a 30-day 
trial period. If you’re interested in 
turning your photos into movie files, 
Adobe Premiere Elements has all the 
tools you need to edit videos.
Writing Creations to CDs and DVDs
You can output creations — such as slide shows and images you optimize for 
TV — to a CD or DVD by using the Slide Show Output Wizard. If you have a 
movie but don’t have a DVD burner, most DVD players sold today enable you 
to view videodiscs written to CDs. The CDs just don’t hold as much content 
as DVDs do.
Figure 15-6: Scroll to the bottom of the Output 
tab in Adobe Bridge on the Macintosh and 
click Save.
Figure 15-7: When you click Instant Movie an 
option for downloading a trial version of Adobe 
Premiere Elements is made available.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
VCDs display at lower resolutions than DVDs. (VCD is an 1150 Kbps video 
stream with a 352 x 240 resolution for NTSC, and DVD is 720 x 480 at variable 
bitrates between about 3000 and 9800 Kbps.) You can get 80 minutes of VCD 
on a 700MB CD (74 minutes on a 650MB).
Writing options to external media vary between the platform you use and 
those services supported by Elements. On Windows you have options for 
writing CDs/DVDs, and videodiscs. Elements supported features on the 
Macintosh are more limited, restricting you to writing files open in Edit Full 
mode or from within Adobe Bridge to a CD or DVD.
On the Macintosh, choose files in Adobe Bridge and choose File➪Burn CD/
DVD. If you’re in Elements, you can click the Share tab and click the CD/DVD 
button. Either action opens the Burn Disc dialog box shown in Figure 15-8, 
and opens your SuperDrive drawer. Place a new disc in the drawer, close it, 
and the file(s) is burned to a CD/DVD.
If you want to create a videodisc on 
the Macintosh, you need to use a 
program like iDVD.
On Windows you have all the options 
at hand for writing to CD/DVDs and 
videodiscs from within the Organizer 
or Edit Full mode.
To write to a CD or DVD on Windows, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a project in the Slide Show Output Wizard by double-clicking a 
project in the Organizer.
 
2. Click Output in the Slide Show Editor.
 
3. Click Burn to Disc in the Slide Show Output Wizard.
 
4. Click OK in the first screen in the Slide Show Output Wizard.
 
 If you want to burn additional slide shows to the same disc, click the 
Add Slide Shows button and select additional slide shows to add to the 
CD/DVD. Otherwise, just click OK to burn a single slide show to a disc.
 
5. Choose a video option.
 
 Click either NTSC or PAL for the video format you use, as shown in 
Figure 15-9. NTSC is commonly used in the United States and Japan, 
whereas PAL is commonly used in Europe and other countries. Be 
certain to check the format used by your video players and TV before 
making a choice here.

 The Burn dialog box opens, and your CD drive door on your computer 
opens.
 
7. Insert a CD and click OK.
 
 The status bar shows the writing progress.
After the CD or DVD finishes writing, pop open your CD/DVD drive and 
remove the disc. Place the disc in your DVD player and press Play. The movie 
automatically starts playing, like any commercial videodisc.
 
If you want to print videodisc labels and CD covers, check out the section

Creating an Online Photo Album (Windows)
Galleries of images are usually added to Web sites with links and/or anima-
tion. You can prepare an online gallery of images, and Elements handles all 
the HTML coding you need to show an attractive display of your pictures 
with a professional look.

346
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
On Windows you can create online photo albums from within the Organizer. If 
you choose the option for Online Album in Edit Full mode, you are switched 
to the Organizer.
On the Macintosh you can create a Web gallery. Although not the same as 
creating an online album, the option enables you to create HTML files that 
can be hosted on a Web server for viewing. Use the Web Gallery pane in 
Adobe Bridge to choose options for creating and uploading a Web gallery.
On Windows, to see how easy it is to create a Web page showing off your 
photos, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the photos you want to display on your 
Web site.
 
2. Click Share in the Panels Bin and choose Online Album from the 
panel options.
 
 The panel displays several output options. You can choose to send an 
album to Photoshop Showcase, Export an album to a CD/DVD, Export 
the slides to an FTP server, or Export to your hard disk as you see in 
Figure 15-10.
 
3. Click Export to FTP and click 
Next at the bottom of the panel.
 
 If you created an album, as we 
explain in Chapter 6, you can 
open the Organizer, click the 
Organize button in the Panels 
Bin, and click the album you 
created for showing photos 
online. This option frees you 
from having to sort through 
the Organizer window to find 
photos you want to add to the 
online gallery.
 
 You can first select photos in the 
Organizer, then click Share, and 
click Online Album. All the selected photos are added to a new album.
 
4. Type a name for your album.
 
 Type a name in the Album Name text box, shown in Figure 15-11, and 
click Next.
Figure 15-10: Choose an option for exporting 
files in the Share panel.

5. Click the Sharing tab.
 
 Notice the two tabs in the 
Share panel. We’ve been 
working in the Content tab 
where selected photos were 
displayed, and we named the 
album. When you click the 
Sharing tab, the panel options 
change to what you see in 
Figure 15-12.
 
6. Choose a template.
 
 At the top of the window you 
find a number of different tem-
plate choices. Click a template 
and preview your photos in the 
template view.
 
7. Add the URL information.
 
 Fill in the text boxes for Server 
Address, Username, Password, and Folder Name as shown in Figure 15-12.
Figure 15-12: Click the Sharing tab.
Figure 15-11: Type a name and click Next at the 
bottom of the panel.

8. Click Test Access to Server.
 
 This option tests your server access. If you have problems accessing the 
server where your Web site is hosted, you need to contact the System 
Administrator for some additional help in uploading your files.
 
9. Click done.
 
 Your files upload to your Web site and are ready for viewing.
If you can’t get a connection to your FTP site by using Elements, use an FTP 
program to upload files. Be certain to upload the entire folder that Elements 
created for you. Inside this folder is the index.html file Elements created. 
You can add links from other Web pages to this file and host a series of differ-
ent creations, all made visible with different Web links.
Flip ’Em Over with Flipbooks (Windows)
Below the buttons for different create and share items on both the Create 
and Share panels, you can find a More Options button. Click More Options to 
open a menu where additional create and share items are found. With regard 
to the Create panel, the More Options menu contains a number of items, such 
as CD/DVD jackets and labels, VCD with a menu, and a flipbook.
At the bottom of the More Options menu in the Create panel, you can find 
a Flipbook option. If you want to create a quick little video that shows off 
your photos by flashing stills on your screen or your TV set, you can quickly 
create a flipbook. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the files you want to use.
 
 Note that you must select at least two files in order to create the flipbook.
 
2. Click the Create tab in the Panels Bin and choose More Options➪
Flipbook.
 
 The Elements Organizer Flipbook opens, as shown in Figure 15-13.
 
3. Set the playback speed by typing a value in the Speed text box or 
moving the slider to the desired speed.
 
 Note that flipping through photos looks best at low speeds, such as 1 or 
2 frames per second (fps). Also, you can select the size for your video 
file from options on the Movie (.wmv) Size drop-down menu.

349
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
4. Click Output.
 
 The Save Video Flipbook dialog box opens.
 
5. Type a filename and click Save.
Your file is written as a .wmv file. You can use Windows Movie Maker to write 
the file to a CD or DVD.
Figure 15-13: The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook dialog box enables you to select a 
speed and movie file size.

Making Creations and Sharing
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding common creation assembly
▶ Creating photo album pages
▶ Constructing greeting cards and postcards
▶ Making your own CD and DVD labels
▶ Using sharing services
▶ Using Photoshop Showcase
A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can be 
shared onscreen or in print. From both the Create and Share panels in 
the Panels Bin in the Organizer and both editing modes, you have a number 
of menu choices for making creations designed for sharing.
In Chapter 15, we look at creating files for screen and 
Web viewing. In this chapter, we talk about creations 
designed for print and sharing. It’s all here in Elements, 
but shhhhh. Don’t tell the Photoshop people because 
Photoshop doesn’t have all these wonderful cre-
ation features.
Grasping Creation-Assembly 
Basics
In Chapter 15, we talk about slide shows, videodiscs, 
online galleries, and video flipbooks. These creations offer 
different output options, such as e-mailing, burning files to 
disc, and creating HTML documents — as well as printing and PDF 
creation.
You work with the remaining creations — Photo Books, Photo Collages, Photo 
Calendars, Greeting Cards, various sorts of online sharing, and PhotoStamps — 
by choosing options from the Create and Share panels on Windows. On the 

352
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Macintosh side you have in addition to Web Photo Galleries, E-mail Attachments 
in the Share panel. Unfortunately, the Macintosh version of Elements doesn’t 
provide you the vast number of sharing options you find on Windows. 
 
When you make a creation that will ultimately be sent to an online service or 
shared with other users, keep in mind that you first must select the photos you 
want in your creation. For example, creating a Photo Book by clicking the Photo 
Book button on the Create panel first requires you to select photos to let Elements 
know what photos are to be used in your book. If you happen to click a button 
and nothing happens, more than likely, you haven’t selected any photos.
Many creation options follow a similar set of steps to produce a file that will 
be shared with other users or sent to an online printing service. In the Panels 
Bin, you can find all you need to make a new project by making choices for 
layouts and producing a creation. Among the common tasks you’ll find when 
making a choice from both the Create and Share panels are
 
✓ Select Photos: In the Organizer, select the photos you want to use for 
your creation. Sort photos (as we explain in Chapter 5) or use keyword 
tags (as we explain in Chapter 6) to simplify finding and selecting photos 
you want to use for a creation. In Figure 16-1, we sorted photos in a 
catalog containing several hundred photos and found only seven images 
meeting the sort criteria.
 
 On the Macintosh, open photos you want to include in new creation in 
Edit Full mode.
 
✓ Click a choice in the Create tab: Click the Create tab, and the Create 
panel in the Panel Bin opens. Click an option for the type of creation you 
want, such as Photo Book, Photo Calendar (Windows only), Greeting 
Card, Photo Collage, and so on.
 
✓ Choose a Theme/Layout: Many of the creation options provide you with 
a selection of templates you can use for creations. When you click a cre-
ation option on the Create panel, the panel changes to display choices 
for various themes, backgrounds, and borders. You make choices by 
clicking the theme and/or background.
 
✓ Number of Pages: Elements automatically creates the number of pages 
to accommodate the number of photos you selected in the Organizer 
(Windows) or have open in Edit Full mode (Macintosh). Note that some 
creations require a minimum number of photos to produce a project. 
Photo Book, for example, requires a minimum of 18 pages.
After assembling your creation, click the Done button. Elements then adds 
the selected photos to the layout and the theme you specified in the panel. 
Be patient and wait for Elements to complete the task.
After a creation has been made, the document appears like any other image 
you open in Elements. You can crop, modify images, print, and more. Using 
an Elements file, you choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog box. Type 
a name and click Save.

353
 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
Figure 16-1: After sorting photos in the Organizer, only images meeting the sort criteria appear 
in the Organizer window.
Creating a Photo Book
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album. With 
the Photo Book creation panel, you have many different options for choosing 
page templates, adding artwork and type, printing your album pages, or send-
ing the files to an online service for professional printing.
Follow these steps to create a Photo Book:
 
1. Select files in the Organizer and click the Create tab. On the 
Macintosh, open photos in Edit Full mode and click the Create tab.
 
 The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the 
Organizer (or an editing mode) and then click the Create tab in the 
Panels Bin. Ideally, it’s best to create an album, as we explain in Chap-
ter 6, and click the album to display the album photos in the Organizer 
window. But remember, after you display an album in the Organizer, you 
still need to select all the photos.
 
 To select all photos shown in an Organizer window, press Ctrl+A 
(Windows). By default, on the Macintosh all the photos open in Edit Full 
mode are used in a new creation.

354
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
2. Click Photo Book in the Create panel.
 
 Regardless of whether you’re working in the Organizer or an editing mode, 
the Photo Book option is available in the same Create panel. When you 
click Photo Book, 
the order system for 
Shutterfly opens. (For 
more on using the 
Shuttefly online ser-
vice, see Chapter 14.)
 
 On the Macintosh, 
when you create a 
Photo Book, you 
can save the file as a 
Photo Project Format 
or as an Adobe PDF 
format. To open the 
file later and edit it, 
save as Photo Project 
Format. To upload 
the file to a service 
or print the file, save 
as Acrobat PDF.
 
3. Choose a Photo 
Book option from 
the Shutterfly 
Wizard (Windows).
 
 The Shutterfly 
Wizard displays 
several options for 
ordering a Photo 
Book, as shown in 
Figure 16-2. Click one 
of the Create Now 
buttons for the type 
of book you want to 
order.
 
4. Select a cover style 
(Windows). 
 
 The next screen 
offers you several 
options for a cover 
style. Make a selec-
tion and click Next.

steps to order your book, as shown in Figure 16-3. Proceed through the 
steps for ordering and identifying recipients.
Greetings!
Creating greeting cards provides you with options for printing greeting cards 
to your desktop printer or ordering cards using an online service.
To demonstrate using options for themes and content, the following steps 
explain how to create a greeting card for output to your desktop printer:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select a photo (Windows), or open a file in 
Edit Full mode (Macintosh).
 
2. Click the Create tab to open the Create panel, and click Greeting Card.
 
 The options available for creat-
ing greeting cards are shown 
on the panel, as you can see in 
Figure 16-4.
 
3. (Optional) Select a theme from 
the Choose a Theme scrollable 
window.
 
4. Click Done.
 
 The photo shown in the Project 
Bin (the one you selected in the 
Organizer window or opened 
in Edit Full mode in Step 1) is 
placed on a design with handles. 
 
5. Click and drag handles to 
resize and/or rotate the image 
within the design.
 
6. Choose a Content option.
 
 The Content panel offers a number of choices from drop-down lists. In 
our example, we added text by choosing Text from the drop-down list 
shown in Figure 16-5.
 
 To add text, click a style in the scrollable list and click the Apply button. 
Default text appears on your layout. Highlight the default text and type 
the text you want to add to your greeting card.
 
7. Save the file.
Figure 16-4: Output options available for 
greeting cards.

356
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
When you create a project and add photos to your project pages, the photos 
are added as new layers. If you want to add text or make edits with the Tools 
panel, you can click the Edit tab and use the same tools on a project as you 
use in other editing sessions. In other words, you’re not restricted to using 
just the text options you find on the Artwork panel if you want to add text in 
a different font and style.
Figure 16-5: Add some text to your greeting card.
Creating CD and DVD Labels
Another creation option in Elements is the simple, easy way to create CD and 
DVD labels. From the Create panel, click More Options and choose a menu 
item for CD Jacket, DVD Jacket, or CD/DVD Label. From templates provided 
in the panel, Elements offers you an easy method for printing your own, per-
sonal labels and jackets for CDs and DVDs.
 
This feature for printing CD/DVD labels is a bit weak in Elements. You may need 
to fiddle around quite a bit to get the images to fit a label. Using templates pro-
vided by the label developers is often a much better method for printing labels.

357
 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
Spreading the Love through Sharing
Several methods of sharing your creations are available in Elements. You 
can use several resources, such as Photoshop Showcase, Shutterfly, Kodak 
EasyShare, and more.
Creating a calendar online (Windows)
Are you ready to design a personal calendar using your favorite photos? 
Elements helps you design an attractive calendar of the kids, the girl’s 
soccer team, the bullhead moose fraternity, or any other type of activity or 
event you want to work with. Elements makes it easy to create professional-
looking calendars.
Here’s how you create a calendar that can be professionally printed and 
ordered via an online service:
 
1. Select photos in the Organizer. 
 
 For calendars, you might want to select thirteen photos — one photo 
for the calendar cover and 12 for each month. You can also choose 
12 photos and use one of the calendar months for the cover photo.
 
2. Open the Create panel and click Photo Calendar. 
 
 The Kodak EasyShare Gallery Services opens. 
 
3. Sign up or enter your account info.
 
 If you don’t have an account, sign up on the opening page in the Kodak 
EasyShare Wizard. If you have an account, supply your logon and 
password. 
 
4. Click through the wizard to upload photos and click the final Next 
button to log on to the service’s Web page. 
 
 At this point, you leave Elements and work within a Web browser.
 
 When you first log on to the Kodak Gallery Web page, you are prompted 
to auto fill or manually fill the calendar. 
 
5. Click Autofill and click Next. 
 
6. Select your choice for the background design and theme in the scrol-
lable window, as shown in Figure 16-6. Click Next.
 
7. On the layout page, click one of the layout options for the number of 
photos you want to appear on each month. Click Next.
 
 If you chose twelve or thirteen photos, use the 1-up option shown in 
Figure 16-7.

 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
Figure 16-8: Preview the calendar.
 
8. Add a title and author/date name. 
 
 The preview page provides text boxes where you can add a title for the 
calendar and supply your name as the author. (See Figure 16-8.)
 
9.  Preview the calendar by clicking the (preview) button shown in 
Figure 16-8. Or click the First Month drop-down list and view the 
layout for each month.
 
10. When the calendar appears as you like, click the Order button and 
proceed to the order page, where you can select the number of copies 
and recipients for your calendar.
Ordering prints online
Right from within your Photoshop Elements workspace, you can place orders 
for prints, Photo Books, and greeting cards, and then have your creations 
mailed to you and any number of friends and colleagues.
For online print orders, select the photos you want to order and click Order 
Prints in the Share panel.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, where you add the order and logon 
information and then submit your order. The steps are straightforward and 
intuitive. In addition to having your prints mailed to you, you can also add 

360
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
other recipients in the Order Prints Wizard. Elements makes it easy to send 
photos to family members living across the country.
Elements on Windows provides buttons that directly link to Kodak EasyShare 
services. If you’re a Macintosh user, you can access the same services by 
opening http://www.kodakgallery.com in Safari.
E-mailing creations
After you put together a creation with the Creation Wizard, you can e-mail the 
creation to your friends, family, or whomever you want by choosing a simple 
menu command. (We introduce this method and other ways to share cre-
ations in the section “Getting a Grip on Assembling Creations,” earlier in this 
chapter.) Additionally, you can e-mail photos to mobile phones. The options 
are all located in the Share panel.
Rather than save your file from Elements and then open your e-mail client and 
select the photo to attach to an e-mail message, 
you can use Elements to easily share photos via 
e-mail with one click.
When you want to e-mail a creation, follow these 
steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the photos 
you want to e-mail to a friend. On the 
Macintosh, open photos you want to share 
in Edit Full mode.
 
2. Open the Share panel and select E-Mail 
Attachments.
 
3. Choose a quality setting for the attachment 
and click Next. 
 
 Drag the slider where you see Quality and 
observe the file size below the slider, as 
shown in Figure 16-9. If the file is large, you 
may need to resize the image in the Image 
Size dialog box before e-mailing the photo.
 
4. Add recipients or bypass this option. 
 
  You can add recipients from your Address 
Book. If you want to add a new recipient, 
click the icon in the top-right corner of the 
Select Recipients tab. Check each recipient 
listed in the Select Recipients pane.
Figure 16-9: Set the Quality to 
a medium setting for faster 
uploads to your mail server.

361
 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
 
 You can bypass adding recipients to your Address Book. If no recipients 
are listed in the Select Recipients panel, you can add recipient e-mail 
addresses in the new message window in your e-mail client, as shown in 
Figure 16-10.
Figure 16-10: Your attachment appears in an e-mail window, where you 
can also add recipients.
 
5. Click Next, and the photo(s) is attached to a new e-mail message in 
your default e-mail client. 
 
6. Review the To, Subject, and Attach fields to be certain the information 
is correct and then click the Send button.
 
By default, Elements uses your primary e-mail client application, which may 
or may not be the e-mail program you use. You can change the default e-mail 
client on Windows by pressing Ctrl+K to open the Preferences dialog box 
when you’re in the Organizer and then clicking Sharing on the left pane. From 
a drop-down list in the Sharing preferences, select the e-mail client applica-
tion that you want Elements to use.
Showcasing Your Photos (Windows)
Almost all the creation and sharing options we discuss in Chapter 15 and 
this chapter, other than those creations you assemble for printing to a desk-
top printer, require you to make purchases. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could 

362
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
share your photos without paying an online service fee or paying for a Web 
address? Well, your answer lies in the Photoshop Showcase services that are 
easily accessible in Elements.
Open the Share panel and click Online Album. 
Elements provides you with a number of sharing 
options for distributing photo albums, as shown 
in Figure 16-11. For more information on creating 
albums, look over Chapter 6.
Among your choices for sharing albums are 
these:
 
✓ Share Existing Album: If you have an album 
assembled, the album(s) appears in the 
Albums list.
 
✓ Create New Album: If you don’t have an 
album appearing in the list or your want to 
create a new album, select this option.
 
✓ Photoshop Showcase: Photoshop Showcase 
is a free online hosting service. You can 
share photos and albums and invite family 
and friends to see your images free of 
charge.
 
✓ Export to CD/DVD: This option enables you 
to export albums to CDs and DVDs.
 
✓ Export to FTP: Use this option to create 
slide shows that can be viewed on your 
Web site.
 
✓ Export to Hard Disk: Use this option to 
export an album to your hard drive. The 
export is an HTML file that you can view in a Web browser. 
To share your photos on the free Photoshop Showcase service, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Photoshop Showcase radio button on the Share panel.
 
 The panel changes to display two tabs. One tab is denoted as Content 
and the other tab is denoted as Sharing. By default, the Content panel is 
in view and displays all selected photos in the Organizer as thumbnail 
images.
Figure 16-11: Sharing Albums 
Online provides several 
different choices.

363
 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
 
2. Select the photos you want to share and then click the Sharing tab.
 
 The panel changes with a preview display of the showcase in the image 
window, as shown in Figure 16-12.
 
3. Make sure Photoshop Showcase is selected and click Done on the 
Share panel. 
 
 The Adobe Photoshop Services Wizard opens. 
 
4. If you do not have an account, you can sign up on the opening wizard 
page. If you do have an account, supply your logon information and 
click Next. 
 
 The Welcome screen you see is shown in Figure 16-13. The Welcome 
screen informs you of the amount of space you have remaining on your 
account and the current usage. If it’s your first effort in using the ser-
vice, you’ll find 0% used.

Figure 16-13: The first screen you see after logging on to the Adobe Photoshop Services.
 
5. Click Next, and you can add recipients, set viewing options, and 
upload your photos. 
 
 You can restrict viewing to invited participants only or make you show-
case public where anyone can view the photos. 
 
6. When you’re finished uploading, click Done.
 
 Your default Web browser loads the Web page where your album resides 
on Photoshop Services, as shown in Figure 16-14.
 
The URL listed in the Location bar in your Web browser can be copied and 
pasted into an e-mail message. If you elect to display your showcase to all 
viewers, anyone visiting the URL can see your photos.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens offers a couple of fun chapters 
to help you take your photography and 
Elements skills a little further. In Chapter 17, you 
can fi nd our top ten tips for composing better 
photos. Find out about the rule of thirds, framing, 
and other simple tricks that can make your photos 
look better than ever. Also, in Part V, we introduce 
the creations that Elements helps you make, but 
why stop there? Chapter 18 offers even more 
ideas for projects you can create for your home or 
work, such as fl yers, posters, inventories, and 
more.

Ten Tips for Composing 
Better Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Finding a focal point and using the rule of thirds
▶ Cutting the clutter and framing your shot
▶ Employing contrast, leading lines, and viewpoints
▶ Using light and giving direction
▶ Considering direction of movement
A
 few things have to come together to make a great photograph. One 
is being in the right place at the right time. Another is the 
ability to tell a story. Yet another is excellent composition. 
Unfortunately, we can’t help with your schedule or sto-
rytelling, but we can give you several easy tips on how 
to take photographs that are interesting and well-
composed. Some of these tips overlap and contain 
common concepts. But they’re all free; they don’t 
require any extra money or equipment. They 
require only an open mind and an eye that’s willing 
to be trained over time.
Find a Focal Point
One of the most important tools for properly compos-
ing a photo is establishing a focal point — a main point of 
interest. If too many elements are competing for attention, a 
photo probably doesn’t have a clearly defined focal point. Your 
eye, therefore, doesn’t know where to look. Too many images without a focal 
point cause the viewer to tire quickly or lose interest. The eye wants to be 
drawn to a subject.

370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Excessive background elements, such as furniture, walls, tables, fences, 
buildings, and even random bystanders don’t add much to the compositional 
or emotional value of your shot. What you really want to capture are the 
smiles and expressions of your family and friends.
 
Keep these tips in mind to help find your focal point:
 
✓ Pick your subject and then get close to it.
 
✓ Include a point of interest in scenic shots. Sunrises and sunsets are 
pretty, but after you’ve seen a few, you’ve seen them all. Try to capture 
an early morning fisherman casting his line off the pier or a child check-
ing out a rogue hermit crab at dusk. That potentially ho-hum scenic shot 
now has some visual punch.
 
✓ When it’s appropriate, try to include an element in the foreground, 
middle ground, or background to add depth and a sense of scale, as 
shown in Figure 17-1. Just make sure that it’s a meaningful element and 
not random clutter.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Pictures
Use the Rule of Thirds
After you find a focal point for your shot, the next step is to try to put that 
focal point, or subject, in a prime location within your viewfinder or LCD dis-
play. Those prime locations are based on the photographic principle called 
the rule of thirds. If you divide an image into a grid of nine equal segments, as 
shown in Figure 17-2, the elements most appealing to the eye and most likely 
to be noticed first are those that fall close to one of the four intersections of 
the dividing lines.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 17-2: Position your subject at one of the intersecting points on 
the rule-of-thirds grid.
When you’re composing your shot, try to mentally divide your frame into ver-
tical and horizontal thirds and position your most important visual element 
at any intersecting point. When you’re shooting landscapes, remember that 
a low horizon creates a dreamy and spacious feeling and that a high horizon 
gives an earthy and intimate feeling. For close-up portraits, try putting the 
face or eyes of a person at one of those points.
If the rule of thirds is too hard for you to remember or employ, when you look 
through the viewfinder, just repeat the mantra, “Move from center.” We all 
have a natural tendency to want to center everything. Get it nice and orderly. 
But centered subjects are often static and boring. Asymmetry often gives you 
more dynamic and interesting images.
 
If you have an autofocus camera, you need to lock the focus when you’re 
moving from center because the autofocus sensor locks on to whatever’s in 
the center of the viewfinder — not on your point of interest. Autofocus can

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
also be problematic when you’re trying to do something as simple as photo-
graphing two people (in this case, you may want the two people in the 
center) and your camera keeps focusing on the space in the distance 
between them. Center your subject in the viewfinder and apply slight pres-
sure to your shutter-release button to lock the focus. Then, reposition your 
subject at an intersecting point on the rule-of-thirds grid and press down all 
the way to snap the photo.
Cut the Clutter
Contrary to what you see on supermarket tabloid covers, those telephone 
poles, branches, car antennas, and other everyday objects don’t naturally 
grow out of people’s heads. Although these mergers, as photographers call 
them, are good for a laugh, they’re not good enough to make it into picture 
frames and scrapbooks. Here are some ways you can cut the clutter from 
your background:
 
✓ Get up close and personal. Many amateur photographers worry that 
they’ll take a photo that accidentally leaves all or a portion of a sub-
ject’s head outside the frame. But more often than not, photographers 
tend to capture too much boring or distracting background. Fill your 
viewfinder frame with your subject. Although you can always crop your 
image later, you should try to fill the frame with your subject when you 
take the photo.
 
✓ Shoot at a different angle. Yes, you can turn your camera! Most photos 
are horizontal merely because it’s easier to hold the camera that way. 
That’s fine for a lot of shots (such as the requisite group photo and some 
landscape shots), but other subjects (buildings, trees, waterfalls, moun-
tain peaks, giraffes, Shaquille O’Neal) lend themselves to a vertical format.
 
✓ Move around your subject. Moving around may help eliminate 
unwanted clutter. Shoot from below or above your subject, if necessary.
 
✓ Move your subject, if possible, to get the optimum background. 
Although there are exceptions, an ideal background is usually free from 
distracting elements, such as tree branches, poles, wires, chain-link 
fences, signs, bright lights, a lot of loud colors, busy wallpaper, and so 
on. Include only what complements your subject.
 
✓ Use background elements to enhance, not distract. On the other hand, 
if your background is interesting and can make your photo stronger, include 
it. You can use famous landmarks, props, and even decorations in the back-
ground to give context to images, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
✓ Use space around a subject to evoke a certain mood. A lot of space 
around a person can give a sense of loneliness, just as a closely cropped 
portrait can create a feeling of intimacy. Just make sure that the space is 
intentionally used in the shot.

373
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Pictures
 
✓ If you’re stuck with a distract-
ing background, you can try 
blurring it by using a wider 
aperture (such as f/4, rather 
than f/11 or f/16) on your 
camera. This makes the depth of 
field (areas of sharpness in rela-
tion to your focal point) shal-
lower so that your subject is in 
focus but the background isn’t.
 
 Because consumer digital cam-
eras use image sensors that are 
typically one-third the size of 
a 35mm frame, the lens is very 
close to the sensor, which really 
increases the depth of field. 
This deep depth of field can 
make blurring the background 
difficult. Not a problem — you can also blur the background by making a 
selection and using the Blur filter in Elements. See Chapters 7 and 10 for 
more on selections and the Blur filter, respectively.
Frame Your Shot
When it’s appropriate, use foreground elements 
to frame your subject. Frames lead you into a 
photograph. You can use elements, such as tree 
branches, windows, archways, and doorways, 
to frame a wide or long shot, add a feeling of 
depth, and create a point of reference, as shown 
in Figure 17-4. You don’t have to reserve the use 
of framing for wide and long shots, however. 
Close-ups can also be framed. Your framing ele-
ments don’t always have to be sharply focused. 
Sometimes, if they’re too sharp, they distract 
from the focal point. And remember to avoid 
mergers!
Employ Contrast
Just remember “Light on dark, dark on light.” A light subject has more impact 
and emphasis if it’s shot against a dark background, and vice versa, as shown 
in Figure 17-5. When people view an image, their eyes go first to the area 
of the most contrast. Obviously, finding contrast in the environment is 
Figure 17-3: Use background elements, such as 
decorations, to help define an event and add 
ambience to the subject.
ImageState
Figure 17-4: Use elements that

374
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
sometimes beyond your control. But 
when you’re setting up a shot, you 
can certainly try to incorporate this 
technique. Keep in mind, however, 
that contrast needs to be used care-
fully. Sometimes, it can be distract-
ing, especially if the high-contrast 
elements aren’t your main point of 
interest.
Use Leading Lines
Leading lines are lines that, by either 
the actual elements in the image or 
the composition of those elements, 
lead the eye into the picture and, 
hopefully, to a point of interest. 
These lines add dimension, depth, 
and perspective by carrying the eye 
through the photo:
 
✓ Diagonal lines are dynamic and 
evoke movement.
 
✓ Curves are graceful and 
harmonious.
 
✓ Horizontal lines are peaceful 
and give a feeling of balance.
 
✓ Vertical lines are direct and 
active.
The best leading lines are those that 
enter the image from the lower-left 
corner. Many elements — such as 
roads, walls, fences, rivers, shadows, 
skyscrapers, and bridges — provide 
natural leading lines, especially in 
scenic or landscape photos. The 
photo shown in Figure 17-6 of the 
Great Wall of China is an example of 
curved leading lines.
Experiment with Viewpoints
Not much in the world looks fascinating photographed from a height of 5 to 
6 feet off the ground. Unfortunately, this is the viewpoint of “Snapshotville.” 
Try to break out of this mode by taking photos from another vantage point. 
Flat Earth

find leading lines, although you may 
not find a longer unbroken curve than the 
Great Wall.

375
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Pictures
Experiment with taking a photo from 
above the subject (bird’s-eye view) or 
below it (worm’s-eye view). A different 
angle may provide a more interesting 
image:
 
✓ Unexpected angles can exag-
gerate the size of the subject. 
The subject may appear either 
larger or smaller than normal, 
as shown in Figure 17-7. Try 
extreme angles with scenic 
shots, which otherwise can tend 
to be rather static or boring.
 
✓ Changing your viewpoint can 
change the mood of the image. 
If the photo in Figure 17-7 had 
been taken from a front angle, 
it would’ve been pretty dull. 
Taken from below, looking up, 
exaggerates the height and 
makes for a stronger and more 
exciting composition, making 
the cactus seem like nature’s 
skyscraper.
 
✓ Use direct eye contact when 
you’re photographing people. 
It provides a sense of realism and makes the image more intimate and 
warm, pulling you into the photo. But remember that children are not at 
the same eye level as adults. We often shoot down at them, making them 
appear smaller than they really are. Try kneeling or sitting on the floor 
and getting down to their level. You’ll also find that you get a less distract-
ing background in the frame, and the lighting from your flash more evenly 
covers the face. Do the same for pets and other short-stature subjects, 
such as flowers.
Use Light
When we think of light in regard to photography, the first thing that comes to 
mind is all those photos we took in the past that are either overexposed (too 
light) or underexposed (too dark). With lighting, you have to consider not 
only whether you have the right amount of lighting, but also these factors:
 
✓ The direction of the light
 
✓ The intensity of the light

angles can exaggerate size, resulting in a more 
interesting shot.

376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ The color of the light
 
✓ Natural light (outdoors) or artificial light (indoors)
 
✓ Creative use of lighting to lead the eye and create a certain mood
If the light isn’t right for your shot, you have quite a few choices: Hurry up 
and wait, move yourself, move the subject, add more light with a flash, or 
diffuse the light. Of course, which one you choose depends on the circum-
stances of the shot and what’s convenient or most productive. Here are a few 
tips to remember about light:
 
✓ The best light for photographs is in the early morning and later after-
noon. The light is warmer and softer, and the shadows are longer and 
less harsh.
 
✓ Avoid taking portraits at midday. The overhead sun causes ugly shadows 
and makes people squint. If you must shoot then, use a reflector to block 
some of the sunlight or fill in the shadow areas. Or you can use a scrim 
(white translucent fabric stretched across a frame) to diffuse the light.
 
✓ Cloudy or overcast days can be great for photographing, especially 
portraits. The light is soft and diffused and flatters the face.
 
✓ Shooting subjects with backlighting (where the lighting comes from 
behind the subject) can produce dramatic results. Figure 17-8 shows 
an example. If you want to see the details of the subject, and not just a 
silhouette, use a fill flash to lighten the shadow areas.

377
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Pictures
 
✓ Ensure that the brightest light source isn’t directed right into the lens. 
This causes lens flare, those strange light circles that appear in the photo.
 
✓ Take into account the color of the light. The light at noon is white, 
the light at sunset is orange, and the light 
at twilight is blue. The color of the light can 
make an image feel warm or cool.
 
✓ Use a flash when necessary. Use a flash in 
low-light conditions. If your built-in flash 
isn’t cutting the mustard, you may want to 
invest in an accessory flash.
 
✓ Get creative with light. Look for those 
unique compositions created by the inter-
play between light and shadow areas, or 
how the light illuminates a particular sub-
ject. Lighting by itself can make or break a 
certain mood or emotion. Think of a simple 
beam of light coming through the roof of 
an old barn. Even in the lousiest weather, 
the most beautifully lit images can emerge. 
When wet objects are lit, they seem to shim-
mer, as shown in Figure 17-9.
Give Direction
When you look at magazines that feature the year’s best photos, they all 
appear as instances of pure serendipity. Sometimes that’s the case, but more 
often than not, the photographer arranged the shot or waited for the right 
light or a special moment.
As a photographer, you also shouldn’t be afraid to play photo stylist:
 
✓ Give directions on where you 
want people to stand, how 
to stand, and so on. For exam-
ple, tell people to touch each 
other, bring their heads toward 
each other, or put their arms 
around each other, as shown in 
Figure 17-10.
 
✓ Designate the location.
 
✓ Arrange people around props, 
such as trees or cars.

you’re photographing while also trying to 
capture their personalities.

378
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Use a variety of poses. Have some people sit and others stand.
 
✓ If you’re dealing with a large group of people, rambunctious kids, or 
excited pets, get someone to help direct. Just make sure that the par-
ties being photographed pay attention and look at the camera.
 
✓ Try to get people to relax. Although spontaneity can yield great images, 
you can still get good photos from posed subjects if they aren’t hating 
the experience.
Consider Direction of Movement
When the subject is capable of movement, such as a car, person, or animal, 
make sure that you leave more space in front of the subject than behind it, 
as shown in Figure 17-11. 
Otherwise, the viewer 
may subconsciously 
experience a feeling of 
departure or discomfort. 
You want to try to give 
the person or object 
room to move into the 
frame. Likewise, if a 
person is looking out onto 
a vista, make sure that 
you include that vista so 
that the person is given 
a point of view and the 
scene is given context.

S
o, you posted all your holiday and vacation photos in an online gallery 
and made enough photo books, slide shows, flipbooks, and greeting 
cards to keep your family and friends content for months to come? Sounds 
like you may be ready to take a crack at some other projects. In 
this chapter, you find ideas for using your inventory of digital 
images to make your life more productive, more orga-
nized, and more fun. Remember that this chapter just 
scratches the surface. With a little imagination, before 
you know it, there won’t be anything left in your life 
that doesn’t include your photos.
Wallpaper and Screen 
Savers (Windows)
If you like an image so much that you want to gaze 
at it while you’re toiling away at your computer, why 
not use that image for the background of your computer, 
better known as the desktop wallpaper? If you can’t choose 
just one favorite image, you can use several to create a multi-
image screen saver.

380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
If you’re serious about image editing, you really should have a neutral gray 
background. But as long as your wallpaper isn’t showing while you do your 
color corrections, feel free to decorate your desktop with your favorite color-
ful photo. Follow these two easy steps to turn a photo into wallpaper:
 
1. From the Organizer, select the photo you want to use.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Set as Desktop Wallpaper.
 
 That’s all there is to it! Your photo has now been transformed into desk-
top wallpaper.
If you have two or more photos you want to use, you can create a Windows 
screen saver. Follow these steps in Windows Vista:
 
1. Select the desired photos from the Organizer.
 
2. Choose File➪Export As New File(s). In the Export New Files dialog box 
that appears, choose JPEG as the file type.
 
3. Select your photo size and 
choose a quality setting, as 
shown in Figure 18-1.
 
 We recommend using a size that 
matches the resolution setting 
you’re using for your monitor. 
Use a quality setting of 12 for 
maximum quality.
 
4. Click the Browse button.
 
5. Click the Make New Folder 
button, save the photos as 
JPEGs to that folder, and 
name the folder something 
appropriate, such as Screen 
Saver. Click OK.
 
6. Choose whether to use the 
Original Names of your files or 
a Common Base Name, such as 
screen 1, screen 2, and so on.
 
7. Click Export.
 
 If all goes well, Elements informs you that it has executed the command.
 
8. Click OK.
 
9. In Windows Vista, choose Start➪Control Panel.

desired images.
 
13. Click OK and Save.
 
14. Specify your other options, such as wait time, power settings, and so on.
  
15. Click Apply and then OK to close the window. Close the Control Panel 
window as well.
Mac users can create custom screen savers even easier:
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu.
 
2. Click Desktop & Screen Saver and then click on the Screen Saver tab.
 
3. The list of possible screen savers is listed on the left. To choose one of 
your photos, select the Choose Folder option. Locate the folder with 
your images and choose your desired image or images.
 
4. Specify your options, such as Display Style, if you want the clock to 
show with the screen saver.
 
5.  Click Test to see a preview. If you’re happy simply close the window 
by clicking the Close button in the top left.
Flyers, Ads, and Online Auctions
Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. Whether you’re 
selling puppies or advertising an open house, adding a photo to an ad or flyer 
really helps to drive home your message.
Here are the abbreviated steps to quickly create an ad or flyer:
 
1. In Edit Full mode, choose File➪New➪Blank File.
 
2. In the New dialog box, enter your desired document specifications 
and then click OK.
 
 Note that you can choose a preset size, such as U.S. Paper, from the 
Preset drop-down menu.

382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 We recommend entering the 
final dimensions and resolution 
for your desired output. If you 
want to print your ad or flyer 
on your desktop printer or at a 
service bureau, a good guideline 
for resolution is 300 pixels per 
inch (ppi). For more on resolu-
tion and sizing images, be sure 
to check out Chapter 3. Leave 
the color mode as RGB and the 
Background Contents as White.
 
 If you want to fill your back-
ground with color, as we did 
in Figure 18-2, choose Edit➪
Fill Layer and choose Color 
from the Contents pop-up 
menu. Choose your desired 
color in the Color Picker and 
then click OK.
 
3. Open your photos and then 
drag and drop them onto your 
new canvas with the Move 
tool. Make sure to choose 
Window➪Images➪Cascade to 
view all your canvases at the same time.
 
 Your image is automatically put on a separate layer. For more on layers, 
see Chapter 8. If you want to use only a portion of the image, as we did 
with the puppy in Figure 18-2, use your favorite selection method to 
pluck out your element. For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
 
4. Select the Type tool, click the canvas, add your desired text, and then 
position your type with the Move tool.
 
 Note that your type will also reside on its own layer.
 
5. When you’re done, choose File➪Save.
 
6. Name your file and choose Photoshop (.PSD) from the Format 
drop-down menu and make sure that the Layers and Color check 
boxes are selected.
 
 If you want to take your document to a service bureau or copy shop, 
such as FedEx Kinko’s, you should save your document as a Photoshop 
PDF (.pdf) file. That way, you don’t have to worry about fonts, compat-
ibility issues, or printing snafus.

7. If you want to save a copy of your ad or flyer in the Organizer in 
Windows, select the Include in Elements Organizer option. In addi-
tion, select Layers, ICC Profile, and Use Lower Case Extension options 
and click Save. Mac users can choose from the Layers and Embed 
Color Profile options.
 
If you’re preparing photos for online auction sites, such as eBay or Yahoo! 
Auctions, be sure to keep your images at a low resolution — 72 ppi, to be 
exact — and at 100-percent scale. Save the file as a JPEG to ensure that your 
file stays lean and mean while preserving colors. Be sure to check the image 
specifications posted on your online auction site.
Clothes, Hats, and More
Many local copy shops, retail stores, and Web sites (such as Zazzle.com or 
Cafepress.com) enable you to add photos to T-shirts, hats, tennis shoes, tote 
bags, ties, mouse pads, and many other items. If you can produce it, they 
can put a photo on it. But it’s easy, and less expensive, to tackle this project 
yourself.
Buy plain white T-shirts at your local discount store or plain aprons and tote 
bags at your craft or fabric store. Then, buy special transfer paper at your 
office supply or computer store. Print your photos on the transfer paper (be 
sure to flip the images horizontally first), iron the print onto the fabric, and 
you’ve got yourself a personalized gift for very little cash.
What do you get for the person who has everything? How about a blanket of 
memories? You can transfer photos onto patches of fabric and create unique 
memory quilts. What grandmother wouldn’t love to have a quilt with photos 
of her children and grandchildren?
 
Costco, the bastion of everything from A to Z, now sells 54 x 70 inch woven 
photo blankets for a mere $60.
Posters
For special events, important announcements, or maybe just your favorite 
family photos, you can get posters and large-size prints at many copy shops 
and service bureaus. Call and talk to a knowledgeable rep at your copy shop 
or service bureau so that you know exactly how to prepare your file. Here are 
a few questions to ask:

384
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ What file format and resolution should the file be?
 
✓ What print sizes do you offer?
 
✓ Do you provide mounting and lamination services?
In addition to printing large prints, many service bureaus mount prints on 
foam core or the sturdier gator board. These service bureaus also can lami-
nate prints to protect them from scratches and UV rays.
 
Again, at Costco, 20 x 30 inch posters sell for $10 while 20 x 24 inch prints on 
canvas (think wedding gift) sell for around $70.
Household and Business Inventories
Don’t wait for a natural disaster or theft to get you motivated to prepare an 
inventory of your household or business assets. Take your digital camera and 
shoot pictures of your items. In Windows, double-click your selected image 
and add text to describe the items in the caption section of the Organizer. You 
can also select the image and choose Edit➪Add Caption. On the Mac, right-
click (or Control+click) the photo in Adobe Bridge and choose File Info. Fill in 
any of fields under the Description tab to include info on your item. Be sure to 
include makes, models, purchase dates, and dollar values of each piece. 
Then, create a single PDF 
document from those 
multiple files by creating 
a slide show, as shown in 
Figure 18-3. Chapter 15 
explains how to create the 
slide show PDF.
After the PDF is finished, 
you can upload the PDF 
file to a Web storage site, 
or burn a CD or DVD 
and place it off-site in 
a safety deposit box or 
other secure location. 
If the need arises, your 
insurance agent can view 
the PDF by using the free 
Adobe Reader software. 
For more on outputting to 
slide shows and writing to CD and DVD, see Chapter 15.

Project Documentation
Nothing helps to document a process like images. The spoken word and 
the written word are great, but showing how something comes together is 
even more effective. Consider using your photographs to help document 
your projects from beginning to end. Whether it’s a project involving home 
improvement, furniture building, crafts, or cooking, take photos at each stage 
to record the project. If you’re taking a class or workshop and the instructors 
don’t mind, take your camera to class. Documenting the positions or steps of 
that new yoga, pottery, or 
gardening class can help 
you practice or re-create 
it on your own later, 
either for yourself or to 
explain to someone else.
Import your desired 
photos into the Organizer 
and create notes on each 
step of the project in the 
caption area. You can 
also create your text on 
the image itself by using 
the Type tool in the 
Editor. Output the images 
to a PDF (described in 
Chapter 15), as shown in 
Figure 18-4.
 
Not into killing trees? Not to worry. You don’t have to print every project you 
make. Any file you create can be left as a purely digital file and e-mailed to 
other users. For details on sharing files, see Chapter 16.
School Reports and Projects
There’s nothing like some interesting photos to jazz up the obligatory school 
report. Doing a botany report? Include some close-ups of a flower with text 
labels on the parts of the flower. Have to write a paper on the habits of the 
lemurs of Madagascar? Trek down to your local zoo and have a photo shoot. 
Create a simple collage of lemurs eating, sleeping, and doing the other things 
that lemurs do. You can use the Photo Collage command on the Create panel. 
(See details about this command in Chapter 16.) Or you can create your own 
custom collage by making selections (see more in Chapter 7) and dragging 
and dropping them onto a blank canvas. In fact, buying your children their 
own inexpensive point-and-shoot cameras may give them a little more enthu-
siasm for school work.
