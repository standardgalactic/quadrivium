Introduction
•
We saw how to ask ChatGPT for information using prompts
•
So far the prompts were quite basic:

Introduction
•
This might result a completion which is not optimal
•
There are ways to get a much better result by providing a prompt 
that helps ChatGPT to understand what exactly we want
•
This is called Prompt Engineering

Prompt Elements
•
With basic prompts we only ask ChatGPT to do something or for 
some information
•
This is one of four elements in prompt
•
Called Instruction

Prompt Elements
Instruction
Context
Input Data
Output Indicator
•
Mandatory
•
Tells ChatGPT what to actually do
•
“Write a short love letter”
•
Additional information that helps ChatGPT to return a better result
•
Often sets the identity of the person doing the task and what should be 
the end result
•
“You are a poor boy living in Manchester in the 18th century. You fell in 
love with a rich, elite girl, and you want to express your love for her, 
but your English is pretty basic.”
•
The data ChatGPT should work on.
•
Used when you need ChatGPT to work on a specific text
•
“Make this email opening more formal”
•
What is the format of the resulting output we want to have.
•
For example – JSON, table, poem, how many words, etc.

Be Specific
•
In order to get the best results from ChatGPT be a specific as 
possible
•
Explain exactly what you’re looking for
•
Use a list of instructions and constraints if needed

*-Shots Prompting
•
One of the great ways to help ChatGPT create results reflecting 
your own voice is to provide examples
•
So far we didn’t provide any examples
•
Adding examples is called the *-shots prompting

*-Shots Prompting
Zero-shots 
One-shot
Few-shots
No examples are provided
One example is provided
Multiple examples are provided

Exercise
•
Let’s exercise what we learned
•
You’re going to ask ChatGPT to write a resignation letter for you
•
Your goal is to make the resignation letter as effective as possible
•
Take you time and try to create the best resignation letter, and then 
resume the lecture and see how I did it
