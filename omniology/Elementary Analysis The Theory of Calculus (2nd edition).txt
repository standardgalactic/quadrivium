Preface
Preface to the First Edition A study of this book, and espe-
cially the exercises, should give the reader a thorough understanding
of a few basic concepts in analysis such as continuity, convergence
of sequences and series of numbers, and convergence of sequences
and series of functions. An ability to read and write proofs will
be stressed. A precise knowledge of deﬁnitions is essential. The be-
ginner should memorize them; such memorization will help lead to
understanding.
Chapter 1 sets the scene and, except for the completeness axiom,
should be more or less familiar. Accordingly, readers and instructors
are urged to move quickly through this chapter and refer back to it
when necessary. The most critical sections in the book are §§7–12 in
Chap. 2. If these sections are thoroughly digested and understood,
the remainder of the book should be smooth sailing.
The ﬁrst four chapters form a unit for a short course on analysis.
I cover these four chapters (except for the enrichment sections and
§20) in about 38 class periods; this includes time for quizzes and
examinations. For such a short course, my philosophy is that the
students are relatively comfortable with derivatives and integrals but
do not really understand sequences and series, much less sequences
and series of functions, so Chaps. 1–4 focus on these topics. On two

or three occasions, I draw on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
or the Mean Value Theorem, which appears later in the book, but of
course these important theorems are at least discussed in a standard
calculus class.
In the early sections, especially in Chap. 2, the proofs are very
detailed with careful references for even the most elementary facts.
Most sophisticated readers ﬁnd excessive details and references a
hindrance (they break the ﬂow of the proof and tend to obscure the
main ideas) and would prefer to check the items mentally as they
proceed. Accordingly, in later chapters, the proofs will be somewhat
less detailed, and references for the simplest facts will often be omit-
ted. This should help prepare the reader for more advanced books
which frequently give very brief arguments.
Mastery of the basic concepts in this book should make the
analysis in such areas as complex variables, diﬀerential equations,
numerical analysis, and statistics more meaningful. The book can
also serve as a foundation for an in-depth study of real analysis
given in books such as [4,33,34,53,62,65] listed in the bibliography.
Readers planning to teach calculus will also beneﬁt from a careful
study of analysis. Even after studying this book (or writing it), it will
not be easy to handle questions such as “What is a number?” but
at least this book should help give a clearer picture of the subtleties
to which such questions lead.
The enrichment sections contain discussions of some topics that I
think are important or interesting. Sometimes the topic is dealt with
lightly, and suggestions for further reading are given. Though these
sections are not particularly designed for classroom use, I hope that
some readers will use them to broaden their horizons and see how
this material ﬁts in the general scheme of things.
I have beneﬁtted from numerous helpful suggestions from my col-
leagues Robert Freeman, William Kantor, Richard Koch, and John
Leahy and from Timothy Hall, Gimli Khazad, and Jorge L´opez. I
have also had helpful conversations with my wife Lynn concerning
grammar and taste. Of course, remaining errors in grammar and
mathematics are the responsibility of the author.
Several users have supplied me with corrections and suggestions
that I’ve incorporated in subsequent printings. I thank them all,

Preface vii
including Robert Messer of Albion College, who caught a subtle error
in the proof of Theorem 12.1.
Preface to the Second Edition After 32 years, it seemed time
to revise this book. Since the ﬁrst edition was so successful, I have
retained the format and material from the ﬁrst edition. The num-
bering of theorems, examples, and exercises in each section will be
the same, and new material will be added to some of the sections.
Every rule has an exception, and this rule is no exception. In §11,
a theorem (Theorem 11.2) has been added, which allows the sim-
pliﬁcation of four almost-identical proofs in the section: Examples 3
and 4, Theorem 11.7 (formerly Corollary 11.4), and Theorem 11.8
(formerly Theorem 11.7).
Where appropriate, the presentation has been improved. See es-
pecially the proof of the Chain Rule 28.4, the shorter proof of Abel’s
Theorem 26.6, and the shorter treatment of decimal expansions in
§16. Also, a few examples have been added, a few exercises have been
modiﬁed or added, and a couple of exercises have been deleted.
Here are the main additions to this revision. The proof of the
irrationality of e in §16 is now accompanied by an elegant proof that
π is also irrational. Even though this is an “enrichment” section,
it is especially recommended for those who teach or will teach pre-
college mathematics. The Baire Category Theorem and interesting
consequences have been added to the enrichment §21. Section 31, on
Taylor’s Theorem, has been overhauled. It now includes a discussion
of Newton’s method for approximating zeros of functions, as well
as its cousin, the secant method. Proofs are provided for theorems
that guarantee when these approximation methods work. Section 35
on Riemann-Stieltjes integrals has been improved and expanded.
A new section, §38, contains an example of a continuous nowhere-
diﬀerentiable function and a theorem that shows “most” continuous
functions are nowhere diﬀerentiable. Also, each of §§22, 32, and 33
has been modestly enhanced.
It is a pleasure to thank many people who have helped over
the years since the ﬁrst edition appeared in 1980. This includes
David M. Bloom, Robert B. Burckel, Kai Lai Chung, Mark Dalthorp
(grandson), M. K. Das (India), Richard Dowds, Ray Hoobler,

Special thanks go to my collaborator, Jorge M. L´opez, who pro-

with him was also a lot of fun. My plan to revise the book was sup-

I thank my editor at Springer, Kaitlin Leach, who was attentive to
my needs whenever they arose.
Especially for the Student: Don’t be dismayed if you run into
material that doesn’t make sense, for whatever reason. It happens
to all of us. Just tentatively accept the result as true, set it aside as
something to return to, and forge ahead. Also, don’t forget to use the

Introduction
The underlying space for all the analysis in this book is the set of
real numbers. In this chapter we set down some basic properties of
this set. These properties will serve as our axioms in the sense that
it is possible to derive all the properties of the real numbers using
only these axioms. However, we will avoid getting bogged down in
this endeavor. Some readers may wish to refer to the appendix on
set notation.
§1
The Set N of Natural Numbers
We denote the set {1, 2, 3, . . .} of all positive integers by N. Each
positive integer n has a successor, namely n + 1. Thus the successor
of 2 is 3, and 37 is the successor of 36. You will probably agree that
the following properties of N are obvious; at least the ﬁrst four are.
N1. 1 belongs to N.
N2. If n belongs to N, then its successor n + 1 belongs to N.
N3. 1 is not the successor of any element in N.

1. Introduction

N4. If n and m in N have the same successor, then n = m.
N5. A subset of N which contains 1, and which contains n + 1
whenever it contains n, must equal N.
Properties N1 through N5 are known as the Peano Axioms or
Peano Postulates. It turns out most familiar properties of N can be
proved based on these ﬁve axioms; see [8] or [39].
Let’s focus our attention on axiom N5, the one axiom that may
not be obvious. Here is what the axiom is saying. Consider a subset
S of N as described in N5. Then 1 belongs to S. Since S contains
n + 1 whenever it contains n, it follows that S contains 2 = 1 + 1.
Again, since S contains n + 1 whenever it contains n, it follows that
S contains 3 = 2 + 1. Once again, since S contains n + 1 whenever it
contains n, it follows that S contains 4 = 3+1. We could continue this
monotonous line of reasoning to conclude S contains any number in
N. Thus it seems reasonable to conclude S = N. It is this reasonable
conclusion that is asserted by axiom N5.
Here is another way to view axiom N5. Assume axiom N5 is false.
Then N contains a set S such that
(i) 1 ∈S,
(ii) If n ∈S, then n + 1 ∈S,
and yet S ̸= N. Consider the smallest member of the set {n ∈N :
n ̸∈S}, call it n0. Since (i) holds, it is clear n0 ̸= 1. So n0 is a
successor to some number in N, namely n0 −1. We have n0 −1 ∈S
since n0 is the smallest member of {n ∈N : n ̸∈S}. By (ii), the
successor of n0 −1, namely n0, is also in S, which is a contradiction.
This discussion may be plausible, but we emphasize that we have not
proved axiom N5 using the successor notion and axioms N1 through
N4, because we implicitly used two unproven facts. We assumed
every nonempty subset of N contains a least element and we assumed
that if n0 ̸= 1 then n0 is the successor to some number in N.
Axiom N5 is the basis of mathematical induction. Let P1, P2,
P3, . . . be a list of statements or propositions that may or may
not be true. The principle of mathematical induction asserts all the
statements P1, P2, P3, . . . are true provided
(I1) P1 is true,
(I2) Pn+1 is true whenever Pn is true.

§1.
The Set N of Natural Numbers 3
We will refer to (I1), i.e., the fact that P1 is true, as the basis for
induction and we will refer to (I2) as the induction step. For a sound
proof based on mathematical induction, properties (I1) and (I2) must
both be veriﬁed. In practice, (I1) will be easy to check.
Example 1
Prove 1 + 2 + · · · + n = 1
2n(n + 1) for positive integers n.
Solution
Our nth proposition is
Pn: “1 + 2 + · · · + n = 1
2n(n + 1).”
Thus P1 asserts 1 = 1
2 · 1(1 + 1), P2 asserts 1 + 2 = 1
2 · 2(2 + 1), P37
asserts 1 + 2 + · · · + 37 = 1
2 · 37(37 + 1) = 703, etc. In particular, P1
is a true assertion which serves as our basis for induction.
For the induction step, suppose Pn is true. That is, we suppose
1 + 2 + · · · + n = 1
2n(n + 1)
is true. Since we wish to prove Pn+1 from this, we add n + 1 to both
sides to obtain
1 + 2 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = 1
2n(n + 1) + (n + 1)
= 1
2[n(n + 1) + 2(n + 1)] = 1
2(n + 1)(n + 2)
= 1
2(n + 1)((n + 1) + 1).
Thus Pn+1 holds if Pn holds. By the principle of mathematical
induction, we conclude Pn is true for all n.
We emphasize that prior to the last sentence of our solution we
did not prove “Pn+1 is true.” We merely proved an implication: “if Pn
is true, then Pn+1 is true.” In a sense we proved an inﬁnite number
of assertions, namely: P1 is true; if P1 is true then P2 is true; if P2
is true then P3 is true; if P3 is true then P4 is true; etc. Then we
applied mathematical induction to conclude P1 is true, P2 is true, P3
is true, P4 is true, etc. We also confess that formulas like the one just
proved are easier to prove than to discover. It can be a tricky matter
to guess such a result. Sometimes results such as this are discovered
by trial and error.

Example 2
All numbers of the form 5n −4n −1 are divisible by 16.
Solution
More precisely, we show 5n −4n −1 is divisible by 16 for each n in
N. Our nth proposition is
Pn: “5n −4n −1
is divisible by
16.”
The basis for induction P1 is clearly true, since 51 −4 · 1 −1 = 0.
Proposition P2 is also true because 52 −4 · 2 −1 = 16, but note
we didn’t need to check this case before proceeding to the induction
step. For the induction step, suppose Pn is true. To verify Pn+1, the
trick is to write
5n+1 −4(n + 1) −1 = 5(5n −4n −1) + 16n.
Since 5n −4n −1 is a multiple of 16 by the induction hypothesis, it
follows that 5n+1 −4(n + 1) −1 is also a multiple of 16. In fact, if
5n −4n−1 = 16m, then 5n+1 −4(n+1)−1 = 16·(5m+n). We have
shown Pn implies Pn+1, so the induction step holds. An application
of mathematical induction completes the proof.
Example 3
Show | sin nx| ≤n| sin x| for all positive integers n and all real
numbers x.
Solution
Our nth proposition is
Pn: “| sin nx| ≤n| sin x|
for all real numbers
x.”
The basis for induction is again clear. Suppose Pn is true. We apply
the addition formula for sine to obtain
| sin(n + 1)x| = | sin(nx + x)| = | sin nx cos x + cos nx sin x|.
Now we apply the Triangle Inequality and properties of the absolute
value [see Theorems 3.7 and 3.5] to obtain
| sin(n + 1)x| ≤| sin nx| · | cos x| + | cos nx| · | sin x|.
Since | cos y| ≤1 for all y we see that
| sin(n + 1)x| ≤| sin nx| + | sin x|.

Exercises 5
Now we apply the induction hypothesis Pn to obtain
| sin(n + 1)x| ≤n| sin x| + | sin x| = (n + 1)| sin x|.
Thus Pn+1 holds. Finally, the result holds for all n by mathematical
induction.

§2
The Set Q of Rational Numbers
Small children ﬁrst learn to add and to multiply positive integers.
After subtraction is introduced, the need to expand the number sys-
tem to include 0 and negative integers becomes apparent. At this
point the world of numbers is enlarged to include the set Z of all
integers. Thus we have Z = {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . .}.
Soon the space Z also becomes inadequate when division is in-
troduced. The solution is to enlarge the world of numbers to include
all fractions. Accordingly, we study the space Q of all rational num-
bers, i.e., numbers of the form m
n where m, n ∈Z and n ̸= 0. Note
that Q contains all terminating decimals such as 1.492 = 1,492
1,000. The
connection between decimals and real numbers is discussed in 10.3
on page 58 and in §16. The space Q is a highly satisfactory alge-
braic system in which the basic operations addition, multiplication,
subtraction and division can be fully studied. No system is perfect,
however, and Q is inadequate in some ways. In this section we will
consider the defects of Q. In the next section we will stress the good
features of Q and then move on to the system of real numbers.
The set Q of rational numbers is a very nice algebraic system until
one tries to solve equations like x2 = 2. It turns out that no rational

§2. The Set Q of Rational Numbers 7
FIGURE 2.1
number satisﬁes this equation, and yet there are good reasons to
believe some kind of number satisﬁes this equation. Consider, for
example, a square with sides having length one; see Fig. 2.1. If d is
the length of the diagonal, then from geometry we know 12+12 = d2,
i.e., d2 = 2. Apparently there is a positive length whose square is 2,
which we write as
√
2. But
√
2 cannot be a rational number, as we will
show in Example 2. Of course,
√
2 can be approximated by rational
numbers. There are rational numbers whose squares are close to 2;
for example, (1.4142)2 = 1.99996164 and (1.4143)2 = 2.00024449.
It is evident that there are lots of rational numbers and yet there
are “gaps” in Q. Here is another way to view this situation. Consider
the graph of the polynomial x2−2 in Fig. 2.2. Does the graph of x2−2
cross the x-axis? We are inclined to say it does, because when we
draw the x-axis we include “all” the points. We allow no “gaps.” But
notice that the graph of x2 −2 slips by all the rational numbers on
the x-axis. The x-axis is our picture of the number line, and the set
of rational numbers again appears to have signiﬁcant “gaps.”
There are even more exotic numbers such as π and e that are not
rational numbers, but which come up naturally in mathematics. The
number π is basic to the study of circles and spheres, and e arises in
problems of exponential growth.

2.1 Deﬁnition.
A number is called an algebraic number if it satisﬁes a polynomial
equation
cnxn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c1x + c0 = 0
where the coeﬃcients c0, c1, . . . , cn are integers, cn ̸= 0 and n ≥1.
Rational numbers are always algebraic numbers. In fact, if r = m
n
is a rational number [m, n ∈Z and n ̸= 0], then it satisﬁes the
equation nx −m = 0. Numbers deﬁned in terms of
√
,
3√
, etc. [or
fractional exponents, if you prefer] and ordinary algebraic operations
on the rational numbers are invariably algebraic numbers.

the polynomial equation x6 −6x4 + 12x2 −13 = 0.

hence 2
√
3 = 4−7b2, hence 12 = (4−7b2)2, hence 49b4−56b2+4 = 0.
Thus b satisﬁes the polynomial equation 49x4 −56x2 + 4 = 0.
The next theorem may be familiar from elementary algebra. It is
the theorem that justiﬁes the following remarks: the only possible ra-
tional solutions of x3−7x2+2x−12 = 0 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12,
so the only possible (rational) monomial factors of x3 −7x2 +2x−12
are x −1, x + 1, x −2, x + 2, x −3, x + 3, x −4, x + 4, x −6, x + 6,
x−12, x+12. We won’t pursue these algebraic problems; we merely
make these observations in the hope they will be familiar.
The next theorem also allows one to prove algebraic numbers that
do not look like rational numbers are usually not rational numbers.
Thus
√
4 is obviously a rational number, while

turn out to be nonrational. See the examples following the theorem.
Also, compare Exercise 2.7. Recall that an integer k is a factor of an
integer m or divides m if m
k is also an integer.
If the next theorem seems complicated, ﬁrst read the special case
in Corollary 2.3 and Examples 2–5.
2.2 Rational Zeros Theorem.
Suppose c0, c1, . . . , cn are integers and r is a rational number
satisfying the polynomial equation
cnxn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c1x + c0 = 0
(1)
where n ≥1, cn ̸= 0 and c0 ̸= 0. Let r = c
d where c, d are inte-
gers having no common factors and d ̸= 0. Then c divides c0 and d
divides cn.
In other words, the only rational candidates for solutions of (1)
have the form c
d where c divides c0 and d divides cn.
Proof

1. Introduction
10
We multiply through by dn and obtain
cncn +cn−1cn−1d+cn−2cn−2d2 +· · ·+c2c2dn−2 +c1cdn−1 +c0dn = 0.
(2)
If we solve for c0dn, we obtain
c0dn = −c[cncn−1+cn−1cn−2d+cn−2cn−3d2+· · ·+c2cdn−2+c1dn−1].
It follows that c divides c0dn. But c and dn have no common factors,
so c divides c0. This follows from the basic fact that if an integer
c divides a product ab of integers, and if c and b have no common
factors, then c divides a. See, for example, Theorem 1.10 in [50].
Now we solve (2) for cncn and obtain
cncn = −d[cn−1cn−1+cn−2cn−2d+· · ·+c2c2dn−3+c1cdn−2+c0dn−1].
Thus d divides cncn. Since cn and d have no common factors,
d divides cn.
2.3 Corollary.
Consider the polynomial equation
xn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c1x + c0 = 0,
where the coeﬃcients c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 are integers and c0 ̸= 0.1 Any
rational solution of this equation must be an integer that divides c0.
Proof
In the Rational Zeros Theorem 2.2, the denominator of r must divide
the coeﬃcient of xn, which is 1 in this case. Thus r is an integer and
it divides c0.
Example 2
√
2 is not a rational number.
Proof
By Corollary 2.3, the only rational numbers that could possibly be
solutions of x2 −2 = 0 are ±1, ±2. [Here n = 2, c2 = 1, c1 = 0,
c0 = −2. So the rational solutions have the form c
d where c divides
1Polynomials like this, where the highest power has coeﬃcient 1, are called monic
polynomials.

§2. The Set Q of Rational Numbers 11
c0 = −2 and d divides c2 = 1.] One can substitute each of the four
numbers ±1, ±2 into the equation x2 −2 = 0 to quickly eliminate
them as possible solutions of the equation. Since
√
2 is a solution of
x2 −2 = 0, it cannot be a rational number.
Example 3
√
17 is not a rational number.
Proof
The only possible rational solutions of x2 −17 = 0 are ±1, ±17, and
none of these numbers are solutions.
Example 4
3√
6 is not a rational number.
Proof
The only possible rational solutions of x3−6 = 0 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.
It is easy to verify that none of these eight numbers satisﬁes the
equation x3 −6 = 0.
Example 5
a =

2 +
3√
5 is not a rational number.
Proof
In Example 1 we showed a is a solution of x6 −6x4 + 12x2 −13 = 0.
By Corollary 2.3, the only possible rational solutions are ±1, ±13.
When x = 1 or −1, the left hand side of the equation is −6 and
when x = 13 or −13, the left hand side of the equation turns out to
equal 4,657,458. This last computation could be avoided by using a
little common sense. Either observe a is “obviously” bigger than 1
and less than 13, or observe
136 −6 · 134 + 12 · 132 −13 = 13(135 −6 · 133 + 12 · 13 −1) ̸= 0
since the term in parentheses cannot be zero: it is one less than some
multiple of 13.
Example 6
b =
	
4−2
√
3
7
is not a rational number.

1. Introduction
12
Proof
In Example 1 we showed b is a solution of 49x4 −56x2 + 4 = 0. By
Theorem 2.2, the only possible rational solutions are
±1, ±1/7, ±1/49, ±2, ±2/7, ±2/49, ±4, ±4/7, ±4/49.
To complete our proof, all we need to do is substitute these 18 can-
didates into the equation 49x4 −56x2 + 4 = 0. This prospect is
so discouraging, however, that we choose to ﬁnd a more clever ap-
proach. In Example 1, we also showed 12 = (4 −7b2)2. Now if b were
rational, then 4 −7b2 would also be rational [Exercise 2.6], so the
equation 12 = x2 would have a rational solution. But the only pos-
sible rational solutions to x2 −12 = 0 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12,
and these all can be eliminated by mentally substituting them into
the equation. We conclude 4 −7b2 cannot be rational, so b cannot
be rational.
As a practical matter, many or all of the rational candidates given
by the Rational Zeros Theorem can be eliminated by approximating
the quantity in question. It is nearly obvious that the values in Ex-
amples 2 through 5 are not integers, while all the rational candidates
are. The number b in Example 6 is approximately 0.2767; the nearest
rational candidate is +2/7 which is approximately 0.2857.
It should be noted that not all irrational-looking expressions are
actually irrational. See Exercise 2.7.
2.4 Remark.
While admiring the eﬃcient Rational Zeros Theorem for ﬁnding
rational zeros of polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, you might
wonder how one would ﬁnd other zeros of these polynomials, or ze-
ros of other functions. In §31, we will discuss the most well-known
method, called Newton’s method, and its cousin, the secant method.
That discussion can be read now; only the proof of the theorem uses
material from §31.

§3
The Set R of Real Numbers
The set Q is probably the largest system of numbers with which
you really feel comfortable. There are some subtleties but you have
learned to cope with them. For example, Q is not simply the set of
symbols m/n, where m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0, since we regard some pairs of
diﬀerent looking fractions as equal. For example, 2
4 and 3
6 represent
the same element of Q. A rigorous development of Q based on Z,
which in turn is based on N, would require us to introduce the notion
of equivalence classes. In this book we assume a familiarity with and
understanding of Q as an algebraic system. However, in order to
clarify exactly what we need to know about Q, we set down some of
its basic axioms and properties.
The basic algebraic operations in Q are addition and multiplica-
tion. Given a pair a, b of rational numbers, the sum a + b and the
product ab also represent rational numbers. Moreover, the following
properties hold.
A1. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c for all a, b, c.
A2. a + b = b + a for all a, b.
A3. a + 0 = a for all a.
A4. For each a, there is an element −a such that a + (−a) = 0.
M1. a(bc) = (ab)c for all a, b, c.
M2. ab = ba for all a, b.

1. Introduction
14
M3. a · 1 = a for all a.
M4. For each a ̸= 0, there is an element a−1 such that aa−1 = 1.
DL a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c.
Properties A1 and M1 are called the associative laws, and prop-
erties A2 and M2 are the commutative laws. Property DL is the
distributive law; this is the least obvious law and is the one that
justiﬁes “factorization” and “multiplying out” in algebra. A system
that has more than one element and satisﬁes these nine properties is
called a ﬁeld. The basic algebraic properties of Q can proved solely
on the basis of these ﬁeld properties. We will not pursue this topic
in any depth, but we illustrate our claim by proving some familiar
properties in Theorem 3.1 below.
The set Q also has an order structure ≤satisfying
O1. Given a and b, either a ≤b or b ≤a.
O2. If a ≤b and b ≤a, then a = b.
O3. If a ≤b and b ≤c, then a ≤c.
O4. If a ≤b, then a + c ≤b + c.
O5. If a ≤b and 0 ≤c, then ac ≤bc.
Property O3 is called the transitive law. This is the characteristic
property of an ordering. A ﬁeld with an ordering satisfying properties
O1 through O5 is called an ordered ﬁeld. Most of the algebraic and
order properties of Q can be established for an ordered ﬁeld. We will
prove a few of them in Theorem 3.2 below.
The mathematical system on which we will do our analysis will
be the set R of all real numbers. The set R will include all rational
numbers, all algebraic numbers, π, e, and more. It will be a set that
can be drawn as the real number line; see Fig. 3.1. That is, every
real number will correspond to a point on the number line, and
every point on the number line will correspond to a real number.
In particular, unlike Q, R will not have any “gaps.” We will also
see that real numbers have decimal expansions; see 10.3 on page 58
and §16. These remarks help describe R, but we certainly have not
deﬁned R as a precise mathematical object. It turns out that R can
be deﬁned entirely in terms of the set Q of rational numbers; we
indicate in the enrichment §6 one way this can be done. But then
it is a long and tedious task to show how to add and multiply the

§3. The Set R of Real Numbers 15
FIGURE 3.1
objects deﬁned in this way and to show that the set R, with these
operations, satisﬁes all the familiar algebraic and order properties
we expect to hold for R. To develop R properly from Q in this way
and to develop Q properly from N would take us several chapters.
This would defeat the purpose of this book, which is to accept R as
a mathematical system and to study some important properties of
R and functions on R. Nevertheless, it is desirable to specify exactly
what properties of R we are assuming.
Real numbers, i.e., elements of R, can be added together and
multiplied together. That is, given real numbers a and b, the sum
a+b and the product ab also represent real numbers. Moreover, these
operations satisfy the ﬁeld properties A1 through A4, M1 through
M4, and DL. The set R also has an order structure ≤that satisﬁes
properties O1 through O5. Thus, like Q, R is an ordered ﬁeld.
In the remainder of this section, we will obtain some results for
R that are valid in any ordered ﬁeld. In particular, these results
would be equally valid if we restricted our attention to Q. These
remarks emphasize the similarities between R and Q. We have not
yet indicated how R can be distinguished from Q as a mathematical
object, although we have asserted that R has no “gaps.” We will
make this observation much more precise in the next section, and
then we will give a “gap ﬁlling” axiom that ﬁnally will distinguish R
from Q.
3.1 Theorem.
The following are consequences of the ﬁeld properties:
(i) a + c = b + c implies a = b;
(ii) a · 0 = 0 for all a;
(iii) (−a)b = −ab for all a, b;
(iv) (−a)(−b) = ab for all a, b;
(v) ac = bc and c ̸= 0 imply a = b;
(vi) ab = 0 implies either a = 0 or b = 0;
for a, b, c ∈R.

1. Introduction
16
Proof
(i) a + c = b + c implies (a + c) + (−c) = (b + c) + (−c), so by A1,
we have a + [c + (−c)] = b + [c + (−c)]. By A4, this reduces to
a + 0 = b + 0, so a = b by A3.
(ii) We use A3 and DL to obtain a · 0 = a · (0 + 0) = a · 0 + a · 0,
so 0 + a · 0 = a · 0 + a · 0. By (i) we conclude 0 = a · 0.
(iii) Since a + (−a) = 0, we have ab + (−a)b = [a + (−a)] · b =
0 · b = 0 = ab + (−(ab)). From (i) we obtain (−a)b = −(ab).
(iv) and (v) are left to Exercise 3.3.
(vi) If ab = 0 and b ̸= 0, then 0 = b−1 · 0 = 0 · b−1 = (ab) · b−1 =
a(bb−1) = a · 1 = a.
3.2 Theorem.
The following are consequences of the properties of an ordered ﬁeld:
(i) If a ≤b, then −b ≤−a;
(ii) If a ≤b and c ≤0, then bc ≤ac;
(iii) If 0 ≤a and 0 ≤b, then 0 ≤ab;
(iv) 0 ≤a2 for all a;
(v) 0 < 1;
(vi) If 0 < a, then 0 < a−1;
(vii) If 0 < a < b, then 0 < b−1 < a−1;
for a, b, c ∈R.
Note a < b means a ≤b and a ̸= b.
Proof
(i) Suppose a ≤b. By O4 applied to c = (−a) + (−b), we have
a+[(−a)+(−b)] ≤b+[(−a)+(−b)]. It follows that −b ≤−a.
(ii) If a ≤b and c ≤0, then 0 ≤−c by (i). Now by O5 we have
a(−c) ≤b(−c), i.e., −ac ≤−bc. From (i) again, we see bc ≤ac.
(iii) If we put a = 0 in property O5, we obtain: 0 ≤b and 0 ≤c
imply 0 ≤bc. Except for notation, this is exactly assertion
(iii).
(iv) For any a, either a ≥0 or a ≤0 by O1. If a ≥0, then a2 ≥0
by (iii). If a ≤0, then we have −a ≥0 by (i), so (−a)2 ≥0,
i.e., a2 ≥0.
(v) Is left to Exercise 3.4.

§3. The Set R of Real Numbers 17
(vi) Suppose 0 < a but 0 < a−1 fails. Then we must have a−1 ≤0
and 0 ≤−a−1. Now by (iii) 0 ≤a(−a−1) = −1, so that 1 ≤0,
contrary to (v).
(vii) Is left to Exercise 3.4.
Another important notion that should be familiar is that of
absolute value.
3.3 Deﬁnition.
We deﬁne
|a| = a
if
a ≥0
and
|a| = −a
if
a ≤0.
|a| is called the absolute value of a.
Intuitively, the absolute value of a represents the distance be-
tween 0 and a, but in fact we will deﬁne the idea of “distance” in
terms of the “absolute value,” which in turn was deﬁned in terms of
the ordering.
3.4 Deﬁnition.
For numbers a and b we deﬁne dist(a, b) = |a−b|; dist(a, b) represents
the distance between a and b.
The basic properties of the absolute value are given in the next
theorem.
3.5 Theorem.
(i) |a| ≥0 for all a ∈R.
(ii) |ab| = |a| · |b| for all a, b ∈R.
(iii) |a + b| ≤|a| + |b| for all a, b ∈R.
Proof
(i) is obvious from the deﬁnition. [The word “obvious” as used
here signiﬁes the reader should be able to quickly see why the
result is true. Certainly if a ≥0, then |a| = a ≥0, while a < 0
implies |a| = −a > 0. We will use expressions like “obviously”
and “clearly” in place of very simple arguments, but we will
not use these terms to obscure subtle points.]

1. Introduction
18
(ii) There are four easy cases here. If a ≥0 and b ≥0, then ab ≥0,
so |a|·|b| = ab = |ab|. If a ≤0 and b ≤0, then −a ≥0, −b ≥0
and (−a)(−b) ≥0 so that |a| · |b| = (−a)(−b) = ab = |ab|.
If a ≥0 and b ≤0, then −b ≥0 and a(−b) ≥0 so that
|a| · |b| = a(−b) = −(ab) = |ab|. If a ≤0 and b ≥0, then
−a ≥0 and (−a)b ≥0 so that |a| · |b| = (−a)b = −ab = |ab|.
(iii) The inequalities −|a| ≤a ≤|a| are obvious, since either
a = |a| or else a = −|a|. Similarly −|b| ≤b ≤|b|. Now four
applications of O4 yield
−|a| + (−|b|) ≤a + b ≤|a| + b ≤|a| + |b|
so that
−(|a| + |b|) ≤a + b ≤|a| + |b|.
This tells us a + b ≤|a| + |b| and also −(a + b) ≤|a| + |b|.
Since |a + b| is equal to either a + b or −(a + b), we conclude
|a + b| ≤|a| + |b|.
3.6 Corollary.
dist(a, c) ≤dist(a, b) + dist(b, c) for all a, b, c ∈R.
Proof
We can apply inequality (iii) of Theorem 3.5 to a −b and b −c to
obtain |(a −b) + (b −c)| ≤|a −b| + |b −c| or dist(a, c) = |a −c| ≤
|a −b| + |b −c| ≤dist(a, b) + dist(b, c).
The inequality in Corollary 3.6 is very closely related to an
inequality concerning points a, b, c in the plane, and the latter in-
equality can be interpreted as a statement about triangles: the length
of a side of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths
of the other two sides. See Fig. 3.2. For this reason, the inequality
in Corollary 3.6 and its close relative (iii) in Theorem 3.5 are often
called the Triangle Inequality.
3.7 Triangle Inequality.
|a + b| ≤|a| + |b| for all a, b.
A useful variant of the triangle inequality is given in Exer-
cise 3.5(b).

§4
The Completeness Axiom
In this section we give the completeness axiom for R. This is the
axiom that will assure us R has no “gaps.” It has far-reaching conse-
quences and almost every signiﬁcant result in this book relies on it.
Most theorems in this book would be false if we restricted our world
of numbers to the set Q of rational numbers.
4.1 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a nonempty subset of R.
(a) If S contains a largest element s0 [that is, s0 belongs to S and
s ≤s0 for all s ∈S], then we call s0 the maximum of S and
write s0 = max S.
(b) If S contains a smallest element, then we call the smallest
element the minimum of S and write it as min S.
Example 1
(a) Every ﬁnite nonempty subset of R has a maximum and a
minimum. Thus
max{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = 5
and
min{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = 1,
max{0, π, −7, e, 3, 4/3} = π
and
min{0, π, −7, e, 3, 4/3} = −7,
max{n ∈Z : −4 < n ≤100} = 100
and
min{n ∈Z : −4 < n ≤100} = −3.
(b) Consider real numbers a and b where a < b. The following
notation will be used throughout
[a, b] = {x ∈R : a ≤x ≤b},
(a, b) = {x ∈R : a < x < b},
[a, b) = {x ∈R : a ≤x < b},
(a, b] = {x ∈R : a < x ≤b}.
[a, b] is called a closed interval, (a, b) is called an open interval,
while [a, b) and (a, b] are called half-open or semi-open intervals.
Observe max[a, b] = b and min[a, b] = a. The set (a, b) has no
maximum and no minimum, since the endpoints a and b do not
belong to the set. The set [a, b) has no maximum, but a is its
minimum.
(c) The sets Z and Q have no maximum or minimum. The set N
has no maximum, but min N = 1.

§4. The Completeness Axiom 21
(d) The set {r ∈Q : 0 ≤r ≤
√
2} has a minimum, namely 0, but
no maximum. This is because
√
2 does not belong to the set,
but there are rationals in the set arbitrarily close to
√
2.
(e) Consider the set {n(−1)n : n ∈N}. This is shorthand for the
set
{1−1, 2, 3−1, 4, 5−1, 6, 7−1, . . .} = {1, 2, 1
3, 4, 1
5, 6, 1
7, . . .}.
The set has no maximum and no minimum.
4.2 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a nonempty subset of R.
(a) If a real number M satisﬁes s ≤M for all s ∈S, then M is
called an upper bound of S and the set S is said to be bounded
above.
(b) If a real number m satisﬁes m ≤s for all s ∈S, then m is
called a lower bound of S and the set S is said to be bounded
below.
(c) The set S is said to be bounded if it is bounded above and
bounded below. Thus S is bounded if there exist real numbers
m and M such that S ⊆[m, M].
Example 2
(a) The maximum of a set is always an upper bound for the set.
Likewise, the minimum of a set is always a lower bound for the
set.
(b) Consider a, b in R, a < b. The number b is an upper bound for
each of the sets [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), (a, b]. Every number larger
than b is also an upper bound for each of these sets, but b is
the smallest or least upper bound.
(c) None of the sets Z, Q and N is bounded above. The set N is
bounded below; 1 is a lower bound for N and so is any number
less than 1. In fact, 1 is the largest or greatest lower bound.
(d) Any nonpositive real number is a lower bound for {r ∈Q :
0 ≤r ≤
√
2} and 0 is the set’s greatest lower bound. The least
upper bound is
√
2.
(e) The set {n(−1)n : n ∈N} is not bounded above. Among its
many lower bounds, 0 is the greatest lower bound.

1. Introduction
22
We now formalize two notions that have already appeared in
Example 2.
4.3 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a nonempty subset of R.
(a) If S is bounded above and S has a least upper bound, then we
will call it the supremum of S and denote it by sup S.
(b) If S is bounded below and S has a greatest lower bound, then
we will call it the inﬁmum of S and denote it by inf S.
Note that, unlike max S and min S, sup S and inf S need not
belong to S. Note also that a set can have at most one maximum,
minimum, supremum and inﬁmum. Sometimes the expressions “least
upper bound” and “greatest lower bound” are used instead of the
Latin “supremum” and “inﬁmum” and sometimes sup S is written
lub S and inf S is written glb S. We have chosen the Latin termi-
nology for a good reason: We will be studying the notions “lim sup”
and “lim inf” and this notation is completely standard; no one writes
“lim lub” for instance.
Observe that if S is bounded above, then M = sup S if and only
if (i) s ≤M for all s ∈S, and (ii) whenever M1 < M, there exists
s1 ∈S such that s1 > M1.
Example 3
(a) If a set S has a maximum, then max S = sup S. A similar
remark applies to sets that have inﬁmums.
(b) If a, b ∈R and a < b, then
sup[a, b] = sup(a, b) = sup[a, b) = sup(a, b] = b.
(c) As noted in Example 2, we have inf N = 1.
(d) If A = {r ∈Q : 0 ≤r ≤
√
2}, then sup A =
√
2 and inf A = 0.
(e) We have inf{n(−1)n : n ∈N} = 0.
Example 4
(a) The set A = { 1
n2 : n ∈N and n ≥3} is bounded above and
bounded below. It has a maximum, namely 1
9, but it has no
minimum. In fact, sup(A) = 1
9 and inf(A) = 0.

§4. The Completeness Axiom 23
(b) The set B = {r ∈Q : r3 ≤7} is bounded above, by 2 for
example. It does not have a maximum, because r3 ̸= 7 for all
r ∈Q, by the Rational Zeros Theorem 2.2. However, sup(B) =
3√
7. The set B is not bounded below; if this isn’t obvious, think
about the graph of y = x3. Clearly B has no minimum. Starting
with the next section, we would write inf(B) = −∞.
(c) The set C = {m + n
√
2 : m, n ∈Z} isn’t bounded above or
below, so it has no maximum or minimum. We could write
sup(C) = +∞and inf(C) = −∞.
(d) The set D = {x ∈R : x2 < 10} is the open interval
(−
√
10,
√
10). Thus it is bounded above and below, but it
has no maximum or minimum. However, inf(D) = −
√
10 and
sup(D) =
√
10.
Note that, in Examples 2–4, every set S that is bounded above
possesses a least upper bound, i.e., sup S exists. This is not an acci-
dent. Otherwise there would be a “gap” between the set S and the
set of its upper bounds.
4.4 Completeness Axiom.
Every nonempty subset S of R that is bounded above has a least upper
bound. In other words, sup S exists and is a real number.
The completeness axiom for Q would assert that every nonempty
subset of Q, that is bounded above by some rational number, has a
least upper bound that is a rational number. The set A = {r ∈Q :
0 ≤r ≤
√
2} is a set of rational numbers and it is bounded above by
some rational numbers [3/2 for example], but A has no least upper
bound that is a rational number. Thus the completeness axiom does
not hold for Q! Incidentally, the set A can be described entirely in
terms of rationals: A = {r ∈Q : 0 ≤r and r2 ≤2}.
The completeness axiom for sets bounded below comes free.
4.5 Corollary.
Every nonempty subset S of R that is bounded below has a greatest
lower bound inf S.

1. Introduction

FIGURE 4.1
Proof
Let −S be the set {−s : s ∈S}; −S consists of the negatives of the
numbers in S. Since S is bounded below there is an m in R such
that m ≤s for all s ∈S. This implies −m ≥−s for all s ∈S,
so −m ≥u for all u in the set −S. Thus −S is bounded above by
−m. The Completeness Axiom 4.4 applies to −S, so sup(−S) exists.
Figure 4.1 suggests we prove inf S = −sup(−S).
Let s0 = sup(−S); we need to prove
−s0 ≤s
for all
s ∈S,
(1)
and
if t ≤s
for all
s ∈S,
then
t ≤−s0.
(2)
The inequality (1) will show −s0 is a lower bound for S, while (2)
will show −s0 is the greatest lower bound, that is, −s0 = inf S. We
leave the proofs of (1) and (2) to Exercise 4.9.
It is useful to know:
if a > 0,
then
1
n < a
for some positive integer
n,
(*)
and
if b > 0,
then
b < n
for some positive integer
n.
(**)
These assertions are not as obvious as they may appear. If fact, there
exist ordered ﬁelds that do not have these properties. In other words,
there exists a mathematical system satisfying all the properties A1–
A4, M1–M4, DL and O1–O5 in §3 and yet possessing elements a > 0
and b > 0 such that a < 1/n and n < b for all n. On the other hand,

§4. The Completeness Axiom 25
such strange elements cannot exist in R or Q. We next prove this; in
view of the previous remarks we must expect to use the Completeness
Axiom.
4.6 Archimedean Property.
If a > 0 and b > 0, then for some positive integer n, we have na > b.
This tells us that, even if a is quite small and b is quite large,
some integer multiple of a will exceed b. Or, to quote [4], given enough
time, one can empty a large bathtub with a small spoon. [Note that
if we set b = 1, we obtain assertion (*), and if we set a = 1, we
obtain assertion (**).]
Proof
Assume the Archimedean property fails. Then there exist a > 0 and
b > 0 such that na ≤b for all n ∈N. In particular, b is an upper
bound for the set S = {na : n ∈N}. Let s0 = sup S; this is where we
are using the completeness axiom. Since a > 0, we have s0 < s0 + a,
so s0 −a < s0. [To be precise, we obtain s0 ≤s0 + a and s0 −a ≤s0
by property O4 and the fact that a + (−a) = 0. Then we conclude
s0 −a < s0 since s0 −a = s0 implies a = 0 by Theorem 3.1(i).] Since
s0 is the least upper bound for S, s0 −a cannot be an upper bound
for S. It follows that s0 −a < n0a for some n0 ∈N. This implies
s0 < (n0 + 1)a. Since (n0 + 1)a is in S, s0 is not an upper bound
for S and we have reached a contradiction. Our assumption that the
Archimedean property fails was wrong.
We give one more result that seems obvious from our experi-
ence with the real number line, but which cannot be proved for an
arbitrary ordered ﬁeld.
4.7 Denseness of Q.
If a, b ∈R and a < b, then there is a rational r ∈Q such that
a < r < b.
Proof
We need to show a < m
n < b for some integers m and n where n > 0,
and thus we need
an < m < bn.
(1)

1. Introduction
26
Since b −a > 0, the Archimedean property shows there exists an
n ∈N such that
n(b −a) > 1,
and hence
bn −an > 1.
(2)
From this, it is fairly evident that there is an integer m between an
and bn, so that (1) holds. However, the proof that such an m exists is
a little delicate. We argue as follows. By the Archimedean property
again, there exists an integer k > max{|an|, |bn|}, so that
−k < an < bn < k.
Then the sets K = {j ∈Z : −k ≤j ≤k} and {j ∈K : an < j}
are ﬁnite, and they are nonempty, since they both contain k. Let
m = min{j ∈K : an < j}. Then −k < an < m. Since m > −k, we
have m −1 in K, so the inequality an < m −1 is false by our choice
of m. Thus m −1 ≤an and, using (2), we have m ≤an + 1 < bn.
Since an < m < bn, (1) holds.

§5
The Symbols +∞and −∞
The symbols +∞and −∞are extremely useful even though they
are not real numbers. We will often write +∞as simply ∞. We will
adjoin +∞and −∞to the set R and extend our ordering to the set
R ∪{−∞, +∞}. Explicitly, we will agree that −∞≤a ≤+∞for
all a in R ∪{−∞, ∞}. This provides the set R ∪{−∞, +∞} with an
ordering that satisﬁes properties O1, O2 and O3 of §3. We emphasize
we will not provide the set R ∪{−∞, +∞} with any algebraic struc-
ture. We may use the symbols +∞and −∞, but we must continue
to remember they do not represent real numbers. Do not apply a
theorem or exercise that is stated for real numbers to the symbols
+∞or −∞.
It is convenient to use the symbols +∞and −∞to extend the
notation established in Example 1(b) of §4 to unbounded intervals.
For real numbers a, b ∈R, we adopt the following
[a, ∞) = {x ∈R : a ≤x},
(a, ∞) = {x ∈R : a < x},
(−∞, b] = {x ∈R : x ≤b},
(−∞, b) = {x ∈R : x < b}.
We occasionally also write (−∞, ∞) for R. [a, ∞) and (−∞, b] are
called closed intervals or unbounded closed intervals, while (a, ∞) and

§5.
The Symbols +∞and −∞29
(−∞, b) are called open intervals or unbounded open intervals. Con-
sider a nonempty subset S of R. Recall that if S is bounded above,
then sup S exists and represents a real number by the completeness
axiom 4.4. We deﬁne
sup S = +∞
if S is not bounded above.
Likewise, if S is bounded below, then inf S exists and represents a
real number [Corollary 4.5]. And we deﬁne
inf S = −∞
if S is not bounded below.
For emphasis, we recapitulate:
Let S be any nonempty subset of R. The symbols sup S and inf S
always make sense. If S is bounded above, then sup S is a real num-
ber; otherwise sup S = +∞. If S is bounded below, then inf S is a real
number; otherwise inf S = −∞. Moreover, we have inf S ≤sup S.
Example 1
For nonempty bounded subsets A and B of R, Exercise 4.14 asserts
sup(A+B) = sup A+sup B
and
inf(A+B) = inf A+inf B. (1)
We verify the ﬁrst equality is true even if A or B is unbounded, and
Exercise 5.7 asks you to do the same for the second equality.
Consider x ∈A+B, so that x = a+b for some a ∈A and b ∈B.
Then x = a + b ≤sup A + sup B. Since x is any element in A + B,
sup A + sup B is an upper bound for A + B; hence sup(A + B) ≤
sup A + sup B. It remains to show sup(A + B) ≥sup A + sup B.
Since the sets here are nonempty, the suprema here are not equal
to −∞, so we’re not in danger of encountering the undeﬁned sum
−∞+ ∞. If sup A + sup B = +∞, then at least one of the suprema,
say sup B, equals +∞. Select some a0 in A. Then sup(A + B) ≥
sup(a0 +B) = a0 +sup B = +∞, so (1) holds in this case. Otherwise
sup A + sup B is ﬁnite. Consider ϵ > 0. Then there exists a ∈A and
b ∈B, so that a > sup A−ϵ
2 and b > sup B −ϵ
2. Then a + b ∈A+ B
and so sup(A + B) ≥a + b > sup A + sup B −ϵ. Since ϵ > 0 is
arbitrary, we conclude sup(A + B) ≥sup A + sup B.
The exercises for this section clear up some loose ends. Most of
them extend results in §4 to sets that are not necessarily bounded.

§6
* A Development of R
There are several ways to give a careful development of R based on Q.
We will brieﬂy discuss one of them and give suggestions for further
reading on this topic. [See the remarks about enrichment sections in
the preface.]
To motivate our development we begin by observing
a = sup{r ∈Q : r < a}
for each
a ∈R;
see Exercise 4.16. Note the intimate relationship: a ≤b if and only
if {r ∈Q : r < a} ⊆{r ∈Q : r < b} and, moreover, a = b if and
only if {r ∈Q : r < a} = {r ∈Q : r < b}. Subsets α of Q having the
form {r ∈Q : r < a} satisfy these properties:
(i) α ̸= Q and α is not empty,
(ii) If r ∈α, s ∈Q and s < r, then s ∈α,
(iii) α contains no largest rational.

§6. * A Development of R 31
Moreover, every subset α of Q that satisﬁes (i)–(iii) has the form
{r ∈Q : r < a} for some a ∈R; in fact, a = sup α. Subsets α of Q
satisfying (i)–(iii) are called Dedekind cuts.
The remarks in the last paragraph relating real numbers and
Dedekind cuts are based on our knowledge of R, including the com-
pleteness axiom. But they can also motivate a development of R
based solely on Q. In such a development we make no a priori as-
sumptions about R. We assume only that we have the ordered ﬁeld
Q and that Q satisﬁes the Archimedean property 4.6. A Dedekind
cut is a subset α of Q satisfying (i)–(iii). The set R of real numbers
is deﬁned as the space of all Dedekind cuts. Thus elements of R are
deﬁned as certain subsets of Q. The rational numbers are identiﬁed
with certain Dedekind cuts in the natural way: each rational s cor-
responds to the Dedekind cut s∗= {r ∈Q : r < s}. In this way
Q is regarded as a subset of R, that is, Q is identiﬁed with the set
Q∗= {s∗: s ∈Q}.
The set R deﬁned in the last paragraph is given an order structure
as follows: if α and β are Dedekind cuts, then we deﬁne α ≤β to
signify α ⊆β. Properties O1, O2 and O3 in §3 hold for this ordering.
Addition is deﬁned in R as follows: if α and β are Dedekind cuts,
then
α + β = {r1 + r2 : r1 ∈α and r2 ∈β}.
It turns out that α + β is a Dedekind cut [hence in R] and this deﬁ-
nition of addition satisﬁes properties A1–A4 in §3. Multiplication of
Dedekind cuts is a tedious business and has to be deﬁned ﬁrst for
Dedekind cuts ≥0∗. For a naive attempt, see Exercise 6.4. After the
product of Dedekind cuts has been deﬁned, the remaining proper-
ties of an ordered ﬁeld can be veriﬁed for R. The ordered ﬁeld R
constructed in this manner from Q is complete: the completeness
property in 4.4 can be proved rather than taken as an axiom.
The real numbers are developed from Cauchy sequences in Q
in [31, §5]. A thorough development of R based on Peano’s axioms
is given in [39].

Sequences
§7
Limits of Sequences
A sequence is a function whose domain is a set of the form {n ∈Z :
n ≥m}; m is usually 1 or 0. Thus a sequence is a function that
has a speciﬁed value for each integer n ≥m. It is customary to de-
note a sequence by a letter such as s and to denote its value at n
as sn rather than s(n). It is often convenient to write the sequence
as (sn)∞
n=m or (sm, sm+1, sm+2, . . .). If m = 1 we may write (sn)n∈N
or of course (s1, s2, s3, . . .). Sometimes we will write (sn) when the
domain is understood or when the results under discussion do not
depend on the speciﬁc value of m. In this chapter, we will be inter-
ested in sequences whose range values are real numbers, i.e., each sn
represents a real number.
Example 1
(a) Consider the sequence (sn)n∈N where sn =
1
n2 . This is the
sequence (1, 1
4, 1
9, 1
16, 1
25, . . .). Formally, of course, this is the
function with domain N whose value at each n is
1
n2 . The set
of values is {1, 1
4, 1
9, 1
16, 1
25, . . .}.

(b) Consider the sequence given by an = (−1)n for n ≥0, i.e.,
(an)∞
n=0 where an = (−1)n. Note that the ﬁrst term of the se-
quence is a0 = 1 and the sequence is (1, −1, 1, −1, 1, −1, 1, . . .).
Formally, this is a function whose domain is {0, 1, 2, . . .} and
whose set of values is {−1, 1}.
It is important to distinguish between a sequence and its
set of values, since the validity of many results in this book
depends on whether we are working with a sequence or a set.
We will always use parentheses ( ) to signify a sequence and
braces { } to signify a set. The sequence given by an = (−1)n
has an inﬁnite number of terms even though their values are
repeated over and over. On the other hand, the set {(−1)n :
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .} is exactly the set {−1, 1} consisting of two
numbers.
(c) Consider the sequence cos(nπ
3 ), n ∈N. The ﬁrst term of this
sequence is cos(π
3 ) = cos 60◦= 1

(1

The set of values is {cos(nπ

2, −1
2, −1, 1}.
(d) If an =
n√n, n ∈N, the sequence is (1,
√
2,
3√

4√
4, . . .). If we
approximate values to four decimal places, the sequence looks
like
(1, 1.4142, 1.4422, 1.4142, 1.3797, 1.3480, 1.3205, 1.2968, . . .).
It turns out that a100 is approximately 1.0471 and a1,000 is
approximately 1.0069.
(e) Consider the sequence bn = (1 + 1
n)n, n ∈N. This is the se-
quence (2, (3
2)2, (4
3)3, (5
4)4, . . .). If we approximate the values to
four decimal places, we obtain
(2, 2.25, 2.3704, 2.4414, 2.4883, 2.5216, 2.5465, 2.5658, . . .).
Also b100 is approximately 2.7048 and b1,000 is approximately
2.7169.
The “limit” of a sequence (sn) is a real number that the values
sn are close to for large values of n. For instance, the values of the
sequence in Example 1(a) are close to 0 for large n and the values
of the sequence in Example 1(d) appear to be close to 1 for large n.

§7. Limits of Sequences 35
The sequence (an) given by an = (−1)n requires some thought. We
might say 1 is a limit because in fact an = 1 for the large values of n
that are even. On the other hand, an = −1 [which is quite a distance
from 1] for other large values of n. We need a precise deﬁnition in
order to decide whether 1 is a limit of an = (−1)n. It turns out that
our deﬁnition will require the values to be close to the limit value
for all large n, so 1 will not be a limit of the sequence an = (−1)n.
7.1 Deﬁnition.
A sequence (sn) of real numbers is said to converge to the real number
s provided that
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists a number
N
such that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < ϵ.
(1)
If (sn) converges to s, we will write limn→∞sn = s, or sn →s. The
number s is called the limit of the sequence (sn). A sequence that
does not converge to some real number is said to diverge.
Several comments are in order. First, in view of the Archimedean
property, the number N in Deﬁnition 7.1 can be taken to be a positive
integer if we wish. Second, the symbol ϵ [lower case Greek epsilon]
in this deﬁnition represents a positive number, not some new exotic
number. However, it is traditional in mathematics to use ϵ and δ
[lower case Greek delta] in situations where the interesting or chal-
lenging values are the small positive values. Third, condition (1) is
an inﬁnite number of statements, one for each positive value of ϵ.
The condition states that to each ϵ > 0 there corresponds a number
N with a certain property, namely n > N implies |sn −s| < ϵ. The
value N depends on the value ϵ, and normally N will have to be
large if ϵ is small. We illustrate these remarks in the next example.
Example 2
Consider the sequence sn = 3n+1
7n−4. If we write sn as
3+ 1
n
7−4
n and note
1
n and 4
n are very small for large n, it seems reasonable to conclude
lim sn = 3
7. In fact, this reasoning will be completely valid after we

have the limit theorems in §9:
lim sn = lim

n

= lim 3 + lim( 1
n)
lim 7 −4 lim( 1
n) =
3 + 0
7 −4 · 0 = 3
7.
However, for now we are interested in analyzing exactly what we
mean by lim sn = 3
7. By Deﬁnition 7.1, lim sn = 3
7 means
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists a number
N
such that
n > N
implies
3n+1
7n−4 −3
7
 < ϵ.
(1)
As ϵ varies, N varies. In Example 2 of the next section we will show
that, for this particular sequence, N can be taken to be
19
49ϵ + 4
7.
Using this observation, we ﬁnd that for ϵ equal to 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001,
and 0.000001, respectively, N can be taken to be approximately 0.96,
4.45, 39.35, 388.33, and 387,755.67, respectively. Since we are inter-
ested only in integer values of n, we may as well drop the fractional
part of N. Then we see ﬁve of the inﬁnitely many statements given
by (1) are:
n > 0
implies

3n + 1
7n −4 −3
7
 < 1;
(2)
n > 4

(4)

n > 387,755
implies

3n + 1
7n −4 −3

 < 0.000001.

Table 7.1 partially conﬁrms assertions (2) through (6). We could go
on and on with these numerical illustrations, but it should be clear
we need a more theoretical approach if we are going to prove results
about limits.

We return to the examples in Example 1.

section.

the expression “lim an” is meaningless in this case. We will

lim n1/n = 1 in Theorem 9.7(c) on page 48.
(e) The sequence (bn) where bn = (1+ 1
n)n converges to the number
e that should be familiar from calculus. The limit lim bn and
the number e will be discussed further in Example 6 in §16 and
in §37. Recall e is approximately 2.7182818.
We conclude this section by showing that limits are unique. That
is, if lim sn = s and lim sn = t, then we must have s = t. In short,
the values sn cannot be getting arbitrarily close to diﬀerent values
for large n. To prove this, consider ϵ > 0. By the deﬁnition of limit
there exists N1 so that
n > N1
implies
|sn −s| < ϵ
2
and there exists N2 so that
n > N2
implies
|sn −t| < ϵ
2.
For n > max{N1, N2}, the Triangle Inequality 3.7 shows
|s −t| = |(s −sn) + (sn −t)| ≤|s −sn| + |sn −t| ≤ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ.

2. Sequences
38
This shows |s −t| < ϵ for all ϵ > 0. It follows that |s −t| = 0; hence
s = t.

§8. A Discussion about Proofs 39
§8
A Discussion about Proofs
In this section we give several examples of proofs using the deﬁnition
of the limit of a sequence. With a little study and practice, students
should be able to do proofs of this sort themselves. We will some-
times refer to a proof as a formal proof to emphasize it is a rigorous
mathematical proof.
Example 1
Prove lim 1
n2 = 0.
Discussion. Our task is to consider an arbitrary ϵ > 0 and show
there exists a number N [which will depend on ϵ] such that n > N
implies | 1
n2 −0| < ϵ. So we expect our formal proof to begin with
“Let ϵ > 0” and to end with something like “Hence n > N implies
| 1
n2 −0| < ϵ.” In between the proof should specify an N and then
verify N has the desired property, namely n > N does indeed imply
| 1
n2 −0| < ϵ.
As is often the case with trigonometric identities, we will initially
work backward from our desired conclusion, but in the formal proof
we will have to be sure our steps are reversible. In the present exam-
ple, we want | 1
n2 −0| < ϵ and we want to know how big n must be.
So we will operate on this inequality algebraically and try to “solve”
for n. Thus we want
1
n2 < ϵ. By multiplying both sides by n2 and
dividing both sides by ϵ, we ﬁnd we want 1
ϵ < n2 or
1
√ϵ < n. If our
steps are reversible, we see n >
1
√ϵ implies | 1
n2 −0| < ϵ. This suggests
we put N =
1
√ϵ.
Formal Proof
Let ϵ > 0. Let N =
1
√ϵ. Then n > N implies n >
1
√ϵ which implies
n2 > 1
ϵ and hence ϵ >
1
n2 . Thus n > N implies | 1
n2 −0| < ϵ. This
proves lim 1
n2 = 0.
Example 2
Prove lim 3n+1
7n−4 = 3
7.

2. Sequences
40
Discussion. For each ϵ > 0, we need to to decide how big n must
be to guarantee |3n+1
7n−4 −3
7| < ϵ. Thus we want

21n + 7 −21n + 12
7(4n −4)
 < ϵ
or

19
7(7n −4)
 < ϵ.
Since 7n −4 > 0, we can drop the absolute value and manipulate
the inequality further to “solve” for n:
19
7ϵ < 7n −4
or
19
7ϵ + 4 < 7n
or
19
49ϵ + 4
7 < n.
Our steps are reversible, so we will put N = 19
49ϵ + 4
7. Incidentally, we
could have chosen N to be any number larger than
19
49ϵ + 4
7.
Formal Proof
Let ϵ > 0 and let N =
19
49ϵ + 4
7. Then n > N implies n >
19
49ϵ + 4
7,
hence 7n > 19
7ϵ + 4, hence 7n −4 > 19
7ϵ , hence
19
7(7n−4) < ϵ, and hence
|3n+1
7n−4 −3
7| < ϵ. This proves lim 3n+1
7n−4 = 3
7.
Example 3
Prove lim 4n3+3n
n3−6
= 4.
Discussion. For each ϵ > 0, we need to determine how large n
has to be to imply

4n3 + 3n
n3 −6
−4
 < ϵ
or

3n + 24
n3 −6
 < ϵ.
By considering n > 1, we may drop the absolute values; thus we need
to ﬁnd how big n must be to give 3n+24
n3−6 < ϵ. This time it would be
very diﬃcult to “solve” for or isolate n. Recall we need to ﬁnd some
N such that n > N implies 3n+24
n3−6 < ϵ, but we do not need to ﬁnd
the least such N. So we will simplify matters by making estimates.
The idea is that 3n+24
n3−6 is bounded by some constant times
n
n3 =
1
n2
for suﬃciently large n. To ﬁnd such a bound we will ﬁnd an upper
bound for the numerator and a lower bound for the denominator.
For example, since 3n + 24 ≤27n, it suﬃces for us to get
27n
n3−6 < ϵ.
To make the denominator smaller and yet a constant multiple of n3,
we note n3 −6 ≥n3
2 provided n is suﬃciently large; in fact, all we

§8. A Discussion about Proofs 41
need is n3
2 ≥6 or n3 ≥12 or n > 2. So it suﬃces to get
27n
n3/2 < ϵ or
54
n2 < ϵ or n >

54
ϵ , provided n > 2.
Formal Proof
Let ϵ > 0 and let N = max{2,

54
ϵ }. Then n > N implies n >

54
ϵ ,
hence 54
n2 < ϵ, hence
27n
n3/2 < ϵ. Since n > 2, we have n3
2 ≤n3 −6 and
also 27n ≥3n + 24. Thus n > N implies
3n + 24
n3 −6 ≤27n
1
2n3 = 54
n2 < ϵ,
and hence

4n3 + 3n
n3 −6
−4
 < ϵ,
as desired.
Example 3 illustrates direct proofs of even rather simple limits
can get complicated. With the limit theorems of §9 we would just
write
lim
4n3 + 3n
n3 −6

= lim

4 + 3
n2
1 −6
n3

= lim 4 + 3 · lim( 1
n2 )
lim 1 −6 · lim( 1
n3 ) = 4.
Example 4
Show that the sequence an = (−1)n does not converge.
Discussion. We will assume lim(−1)n = a and obtain a contra-
diction. No matter what a is, either 1 or −1 will have distance at
least 1 from a. Thus the inequality |(−1)n −a| < 1 will not hold for
all large n.
Formal Proof
Assume lim(−1)n = a for some a ∈R. Letting ϵ = 1 in the deﬁnition
of the limit, we see that there exists N such that
n > N
implies
|(−1)n −a| < 1.
By considering both an even and an odd n > N, we see that
|1 −a| < 1
and
| −1 −a| < 1.

2. Sequences
42
Now by the Triangle Inequality 3.7
2 = |1 −(−1)| = |1 −a + a −(−1)| ≤|1 −a| + |a −(−1)| < 1 + 1 = 2.
This absurdity shows our assumption lim(−1)n = a must be wrong,
so the sequence (−1)n does not converge.
Example 5
Let (sn) be a sequence of nonnegative real numbers and suppose
s = lim sn. Note s ≥0; see Exercise 8.9(a). Prove lim √sn = √s.
Discussion. We need to consider ϵ > 0 and show there exists N
such that
n > N
implies
|√sn −√s| < ϵ.
This time we cannot expect to obtain N explicitly in terms of ϵ
because of the general nature of the problem. But we can hope to
show such N exists. The trick here is to violate our training in algebra
and “irrationalize the denominator”:
√sn −√s = (√sn −√s)(√sn + √s)
√sn + √s
=
sn −s
√sn + √s.
Since sn →s we will be able to make the numerator small [for large
n]. Unfortunately, if s = 0 the denominator will also be small. So we
consider two cases. If s > 0, the denominator is bounded below by
√s and our trick will work:
|√sn −√s| ≤|sn −s|
√s
,
so we will select N so that |sn −s| < √sϵ for n > N. Note that N
exists, since we can apply the deﬁnition of limit to √sϵ just as well
as to ϵ. For s = 0, it can be shown directly that lim sn = 0 implies
lim √sn = 0; the trick of “irrationalizing the denominator” is not
needed in this case.
Formal Proof
Case I: s > 0. Let ϵ > 0. Since lim sn = s, there exists N such that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < √sϵ.

§8. A Discussion about Proofs 43
Now n > N implies
|√sn −√s| =
|sn −s|
√sn + √s ≤|sn −s|
√s
<
√sϵ
√s = ϵ.
Case II: s = 0. This case is left to Exercise 8.3.
Example 6
Let (sn) be a convergent sequence of real numbers such that sn ̸= 0
for all n ∈N and lim sn = s ̸= 0. Prove inf{|sn| : n ∈N} > 0.
Discussion. The idea is that “most” of the terms sn are close to s
and hence not close to 0. More explicitly, “most” of the terms sn are
within 1
2|s| of s, hence most sn satisfy |sn| ≥1
2|s|. This seems clear
from Fig. 8.1, but a formal proof will use the triangle inequality.
Formal Proof
Let ϵ = 1
2|s| > 0. Since lim sn = s, there exists N in N so that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < |s|
2 .
Now
n > N
implies
|sn| ≥|s|
2 ,
(1)
since otherwise the triangle inequality would imply
|s| = |s −sn + sn| ≤|s −sn| + |sn| < |s|
2 + |s|
2 = |s|
which is absurd. If we set
m = min
|s|
2 , |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sN|
	
,
FIGURE 8.1

2. Sequences
44
then we clearly have m > 0 and |sn| ≥m for all n ∈N in view of (1).
Thus inf{|sn| : n ∈N} ≥m > 0, as desired.
Formal proofs are required in the following exercises.

§9
Limit Theorems for Sequences
In this section we prove some basic results that are probably al-
ready familiar to the reader. First we prove convergent sequences
are bounded. A sequence (sn) of real numbers is said to be bounded
if the set {sn : n ∈N} is a bounded set, i.e., if there exists a constant
M such that |sn| ≤M for all n.
9.1 Theorem.
Convergent sequences are bounded.
Proof
Let (sn) be a convergent sequence, and let s = lim sn. Applying
Deﬁnition 7.1 with ϵ = 1 we obtain N in N so that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < 1.
From the triangle inequality we see n > N implies |sn| < |s| + 1.
Deﬁne M = max{|s| + 1, |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sN|}. Then we have |sn| ≤M
for all n ∈N, so (sn) is a bounded sequence.
In the proof of Theorem 9.1 we only needed to use property 7.1(1)
for a single value of ϵ. Our choice of ϵ = 1 was quite arbitrary.
2This exercise is referred to in several places.

9.2 Theorem.
If the sequence (sn) converges to s and k is in R, then the sequence
(ksn) converges to ks. That is, lim(ksn) = k · lim sn.
Proof
We assume k ̸= 0, since this result is trivial for k = 0. Let ϵ > 0 and
note we need to show |ksn −ks| < ϵ for large n. Since lim sn = s,
there exists N such that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < ϵ
|k|.
Then
n > N
implies
|ksn −ks| < ϵ.
9.3 Theorem.
If (sn) converges to s and (tn) converges to t, then (sn+tn) converges
to s + t. That is,
lim(sn + tn) = lim sn + lim tn.
Proof
Let ϵ > 0; we need to show
|sn + tn −(s + t)| < ϵ
for large
n.
We note |sn +tn −(s+t)| ≤|sn −s|+|tn −t|. Since lim sn = s, there
exists N1 such that
n > N1
implies
|sn −s| < ϵ
2.
Likewise, there exists N2 such that
n > N2
implies
|tn −t| < ϵ
2.
Let N = max{N1, N2}. Then clearly
n>N
implies
|sn+tn−(s+t)| ≤|sn−s|+|tn−t|< ϵ
2+ ϵ
2 = ϵ.
9.4 Theorem.
If (sn) converges to s and (tn) converges to t, then (sntn) converges
to st. That is,
lim(sntn) = (lim sn)(lim tn).

§9. Limit Theorems for Sequences 47
Discussion. The trick here is to look at the inequality
|sntn −st| = |sntn −snt + snt −st|
≤|sntn −snt| + |snt −st| = |sn| · |tn −t| + |t| · |sn −s|.
For large n, |tn−t| and |sn−s| are small and |t| is, of course, constant.
Fortunately, Theorem 9.1 shows |sn| is bounded, so we will be able
to show |sntn −snt| is small.
Proof
Let ϵ > 0. By Theorem 9.1 there is a constant M > 0 such that
|sn| ≤M for all n. Since lim tn = t there exists N1 such that
n > N1
implies
|tn −t| <
ϵ
2M .
Also, since lim sn = s there exists N2 such that
n > N2
implies

9.5 Lemma.
If (sn) converges to s, if sn ̸= 0 for all n, and if s ̸= 0, then (1/sn)
converges to 1/s.

For large n, the numerator is small. The only possible diﬃculty would
be if the denominator were also small for large n. This diﬃculty was
solved in Example 6 of §8 where we proved m= inf{|sn| : n∈N}>0.

and it is clear how our proof should proceed.
Proof
Let ϵ > 0. By Example 6 of §8, there exists m > 0 such that |sn| ≥m
for all n. Since lim sn = s there exists N such that
n > N
implies
|s −sn| < ϵ · m|s|.

9.6 Theorem.
Suppose (sn) converges to s and (tn) converges to t. If s ̸= 0 and
sn ̸= 0 for all n, then (tn/sn) converges to t/s.
Proof
By Lemma 9.5, the sequence (1/sn) converges to 1/s, so
lim tn
sn
= lim 1
sn
· tn = 1
s · t = t
s
by Theorem 9.4.
The preceding limit theorems and a few standard examples allow
one to easily calculate many limits.
9.7 Theorem (Basic Examples).
(a) limn→∞( 1
np ) = 0 for p > 0.
(b) limn→∞an = 0 if |a| < 1.
(c) lim(n1/n) = 1.
(d) limn→∞(a1/n) = 1 for a > 0.
Proof
(a) Let ϵ > 0 and let N = (1
ϵ )1/p. Then n > N implies np > 1
ϵ
and hence ϵ >
1
np . Since
1
np > 0, this shows n > N implies
| 1
np −0| < ϵ. [The meaning of np when p is not an integer will
be discussed in §37.]
(b) We may suppose a ̸= 0, because limn→∞an = 0 is obvious for
a = 0. Since |a| < 1, we can write |a| =
1
1+b where b > 0. By

§9. Limit Theorems for Sequences 49
the binomial theorem [Exercise 1.12], (1 + b)n ≥1 + nb > nb,
so
|an −0| = |an| =
1
(1 + b)n < 1
nb.
Now consider ϵ > 0 and let N = 1
ϵb. Then n > N implies n > 1
ϵb
and hence |an −0| <
1
nb < ϵ.
(c) Let sn = (n1/n) −1 and note sn ≥0 for all n. By Theorem 9.3
it suﬃces to show lim sn = 0. Since 1 + sn = (n1/n), we have
n = (1 + sn)n. For n ≥2 we use the binomial expansion of
(1 + sn)n to conclude
n = (1 + sn)n ≥1 + nsn + 1
2n(n −1)s2
n > 1
2n(n −1)s2
n.
Thus n > 1
2n(n −1)s2
n, so s2
n <
2
n−1. Consequently, we have
sn <

2
n−1 for n ≥2. A standard argument now shows
lim sn = 0; see Exercise 9.7.
(d) First suppose a ≥1. Then for n ≥a we have 1 ≤a1/n ≤n1/n.
Since lim n1/n = 1, it follows easily that lim(a1/n) = 1; compare
Exercise 8.5(a). Suppose 0 < a < 1. Then 1
a > 1, so lim( 1
a)1/n =
1 from above. Lemma 9.5 now shows lim(a1/n) = 1.
Example 1
Prove lim sn = 1
4, where
sn = n3 + 6n2 + 7
4n3 + 3n −4.
Solution
We have
sn = 1 + 6
n + 7
n3
4 + 3
n2 −4
n3
.
By Theorem 9.7(a) we have lim 1
n = 0 and lim 1
n3 = 0. Hence by
Theorems 9.3 and 9.2 we have
lim

1 + 6
n + 7
n3

= lim(1) + 6 · lim

 1
n

+ 7 · lim

 1
n3

= 1.

2. Sequences
50
Similarly, we have
lim

4 + 3
n2 −4
n3

= 4.
Hence Theorem 9.6 implies lim sn = 1
4.
Example 2
Find lim n−5
n2+7.
Solution
Let sn =
n−5
n2+7. We can write sn as
1−5
n
n+ 7
n , but then the denominator
does not converge. So we write
sn =
1
n −5
n2
1 + 7
n2
.
Now lim( 1
n −
5
n2) = 0 by Theorems 9.7(a), 9.3 and 9.2. Likewise
lim(1 + 7
n2 ) = 1, so Theorem 9.6 implies lim sn = 0
1 = 0.
Example 3
Find lim n2+3
n+1 .
Solution
We can write n2+3
n+1 as
n + 3
n
1 + 1
n
or
1 + 3
n2
1
n + 1
n2
.
Both fractions lead to problems: either the numerator does not con-
verge or else the denominator converges to 0. It turns out n2+3
n+1 does
not converge and the symbol lim n2+3
n+1 is undeﬁned, at least for the
present; see Example 6. The reader may have the urge to use the sym-
bol +∞here. Our next task is to make such use of the symbol +∞
legitimate. For a sequence (sn), lim sn = +∞will signify that the
terms sn are eventually all large. Here is the precise deﬁnition.
9.8 Deﬁnition.
For a sequence (sn), we write lim sn = +∞provided
for each M > 0 there is a number N such that
n > N implies sn > M.

§9. Limit Theorems for Sequences 51
In this case we say the sequence diverges to +∞.
Similarly, we write lim sn = −∞provided
for each M < 0 there is a number N such that
n > N implies sn < M.
Henceforth we will say (sn) has a limit or the limit exists pro-
vided (sn) converges or diverges to +∞or diverges to −∞. In the
deﬁnition of lim sn = +∞the challenging values of M are large pos-
itive numbers: the larger M is the larger N will need to be. In the
deﬁnition of lim sn = −∞the challenging values of M are “large”
negative numbers like −10,000,000,000.
Example 4
We have lim n2
= +∞, lim(−n) = −∞, lim 2n
= +∞and
lim(√n + 7) = +∞. Of course, many sequences do not have limits
+∞or −∞even if they are unbounded. For example, the sequences
deﬁned by sn = (−1)nn and tn = n cos2(nπ
2 ) are unbounded, but
they do not diverge to +∞or −∞, so the expressions lim[(−1)nn]
and lim[n cos2(nπ
2 )] are meaningless. Note tn = n when n is even and
tn = 0 when n is odd.
The strategy for proofs involving inﬁnite limits is very much the
same as for ﬁnite limits. We give some examples.
Example 5
Give a formal proof that lim(√n + 7) = +∞.
Discussion. We need to consider an arbitrary M > 0 and show
there exists N [which will depend on M] such that
n > N
implies
√n + 7 > M.
To see how big N must be we “solve” for n in the inequality √n+7 >
M. This inequality holds provided √n > M −7 or n > (M −7)2.
Thus we will take N = (M −7)2.
Formal Proof
Let M > 0 and let N = (M −7)2. Then n > N implies n > (M −7)2,
hence √n > M −7, hence √n + 7 > M. This shows lim(√n + 7) =
+∞.

2. Sequences
52
Example 6
Give a formal proof that lim n2+3
n+1 = +∞; see Example 3.
Discussion. Consider M > 0. We need to determine how large n
must be to guarantee n2+3
n+1 > M. The idea is to bound the fraction
n2+3
n+1 below by some multiple of n2
n = n; compare Example 3 of §8.
Since n2 + 3 > n2 and n + 1 ≤2n, we have n2+3
n+1 > n2
2n = 1
2n, and it
suﬃces to arrange for 1
2n > M.
Formal Proof
Let M > 0 and let N = 2M. Then n > N implies 1
2n > M, which
implies
n2 + 3
n + 1 > n2
2n = 1
2n > M.
Hence lim n2+3
n+1 = +∞.
The limit in Example 6 would be easier to handle if we could
apply a limit theorem. But the limit Theorems 9.2–9.6 do not apply.
WARNING. Do not attempt to apply the limit Theorems 9.2–9.6
to inﬁnite limits. Use Theorem 9.9 or 9.10 below or Exercises 9.9–
9.12.
9.9 Theorem.
Let (sn) and (tn) be sequences such that lim sn = +∞and lim tn > 0
[lim tn can be ﬁnite or +∞]. Then lim sntn = +∞.
Discussion. Let M > 0. We need to show sntn > M for large n.
We have lim sn = +∞, and we need to be sure the tn’s are bounded
away from 0 for large n. We will choose a real number m so that
0 < m < lim tn and observe tn > m for large n. Then all we need is
sn > M
m for large n.
Proof
Let M > 0. Select a real number m so that 0 < m < lim tn. Whether
lim tn = +∞or not, it is clear there exists N1 such that
n > N1
implies
tn > m;

§9. Limit Theorems for Sequences 53
see Exercise 8.10. Since lim sn = +∞, there exists N2 so that
n > N2
implies
sn > M
m .
Put N = max{N1, N2}. Then n > N implies sntn > M
m ·m = M.
Example 7
Use Theorem 9.9 to prove lim n2+3
n+1 = +∞; see Example 6.
Solution
We observe n2+3
n+1 =
n+ 3
n
1+ 1
n = sntn where sn = n + 3
n and tn =
1
1+ 1
n . It
is easy to show lim sn = +∞and lim tn = 1. So by Theorem 9.9, we
have lim sntn = +∞.
Here is another useful theorem.
9.10 Theorem.
For a sequence (sn) of positive real numbers, we have lim sn = +∞
if and only if lim( 1
sn ) = 0.
Proof
Let (sn) be a sequence of positive real numbers. We have to show
lim sn = +∞
implies
lim

 1
sn

= 0
(1)
and
lim

 1
sn

= 0
implies
lim sn = +∞.
(2)
In this case the proofs will appear very similar, but the thought
processes will be quite diﬀerent.
To prove (1), suppose lim sn = +∞. Let ϵ > 0 and let M = 1
ϵ.
Since lim sn = +∞, there exists N such that n > N implies sn >
M = 1
ϵ. Therefore n > N implies ϵ >
1
sn > 0, so
n > N
implies

1
sn
−0
 < ϵ.
That is, lim( 1
sn ) = 0. This proves (1).
To prove (2), we abandon the notation of the last paragraph and
begin anew. Suppose lim( 1
sn ) = 0. Let M > 0 and let ϵ =
1
M . Then

2. Sequences
54
ϵ > 0, so there exists N such that n > N implies | 1
sn −0| < ϵ =
1
M .
Since sn > 0, we can write
n > N
implies
0 < 1
sn
< 1
M
and hence
n > N
implies
M < sn.
That is, lim sn = +∞and (2) holds.

§10
Monotone Sequences and Cauchy
Sequences
In this section we obtain two theorems [Theorems 10.2 and 10.11]
that will allow us to conclude certain sequences converge without
knowing the limit in advance. These theorems are important because
in practice the limits are not usually known in advance.
10.1 Deﬁnition.
A sequence (sn) of real numbers is called an increasing sequence
if sn ≤sn+1 for all n, and (sn) is called a decreasing sequence if
sn ≥sn+1 for all n. Note that if (sn) is increasing, then sn ≤sm
whenever n < m. A sequence that is increasing or decreasing4 will
be called a monotone sequence or a monotonic sequence.
Example 1
The sequences deﬁned by an
= 1 −1
n, bn
= n3 and cn
=
(1+ 1
n)n are increasing sequences, although this is not obvious for the
4In the First Edition of this book, increasing and decreasing sequences were
referred to as “nondecreasing” and “nonincreasing” sequences, respectively.

§10.
Monotone Sequences and Cauchy Sequences 57
sequence (cn). The sequence dn =
1
n2 is decreasing. The sequences
sn = (−1)n, tn = cos(nπ
3 ), un = (−1)nn and vn = (−1)n
n
are not
monotonic sequences. Also xn = n1/n is not monotonic, as can be
seen by examining the ﬁrst four values; see Example 1(d) on page 33
in §7.
Of the sequences above, (an), (cn), (dn), (sn), (tn), (vn) and (xn)
are bounded sequences. The remaining sequences, (bn) and (un), are
unbounded sequences.
10.2 Theorem.
All bounded monotone sequences converge.
Proof
Let (sn) be a bounded increasing sequence. Let S denote the set
{sn : n ∈N}, and let u = sup S. Since S is bounded, u represents a
real number. We show lim sn = u. Let ϵ > 0. Since u −ϵ is not an
upper bound for S, there exists N such that sN > u −ϵ. Since (sn)
is increasing, we have sN ≤sn for all n ≥N. Of course, sn ≤u for
all n, so n > N implies u −ϵ < sn ≤u, which implies |sn −u| < ϵ.
This shows lim sn = u.
The
proof
for
bounded
decreasing
sequences
is
left
to
Exercise 10.2.
Note the Completeness Axiom 4.4 is a vital ingredient in the
proof of Theorem 10.2.
Example 2
Consider the sequence (sn) deﬁned recursively by
s1 = 5
and
sn = s2
n−1 + 5
2sn−1
for
n ≥2.
(1)
Thus s2 = 3 and s3 = 7
3 ≈2.333. First, note a simple induction
argument shows sn > 0 for all n. We will show limn sn exists by
showing the sequence is decreasing and bounded; see Theorem 10.2.
In fact, we will prove the following by induction:
√
5 < sn+1 < sn ≤5
for
n ≥1.
(2)

2. Sequences
58
Since
√
5 ≈2.236, our computations show (2) holds for n ≤2. For
the induction step, assume (2) holds for some n ≥2. To show sn+2 <
sn+1, we need
s2
n+1 + 5
2sn+1
< sn+1
or
s2
n+1 + 5 < 2s2
n+1
or
5 < s2
n+1,
but this holds because sn+1 >
√
5 by the assumption (2) for n. To
show sn+2 >
√
5, we need
s2
n+1 + 5
2sn+1
>
√
5
or
s2
n+1 + 5 > 2
√
5sn+1
or s2
n+1−2
√
5sn+1+5 > 0, which is true because s2
n+1−2
√
5sn+1+5 =
(sn+1 −
√
5)2 > 0. Thus (2) holds for n + 1 whenever (2) holds for n.
Hence (2) holds for all n by induction. Thus s = limn sn exists.
If one looks at s4 = 47
21 ≈2.238095 and compares with
√
5 ≈
2.236068, one might suspect s =
√
5. To verify this, we apply the
limit Theorems 9.2–9.4 and the fact s = limn sn+1 to the equation
2 · sn+1sn = s2
n + 5 to obtain 2s2 = s2 + 5. Thus s2 = 5 and s =
√
5,
since the limit is certainly not −
√

10.3 Discussion of Decimals.
We have not given much attention to the notion that real numbers
are simply decimal expansions. This notion is substantially correct,
but there are subtleties to be faced. For example, diﬀerent decimal
expansions can represent the same real number. The somewhat more
abstract developments of the set R of real numbers discussed in §6
turn out to be more satisfactory.
We restrict our attention to nonnegative decimal expansions and
nonnegative real numbers. From our point of view, every nonnegative
decimal expansion is shorthand for the limit of a bounded increasing
sequence of real numbers. Suppose we are given a decimal expansion
K.d1d2d3d4 · · ·, where K is a nonnegative integer and each dj belongs
to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let
sn = K + d1
10 + d2
102 + · · · + dn
10n.
(1)
Then (sn) is an increasing sequence of real numbers, and (sn) is
bounded [by K + 1, in fact]. So by Theorem 10.2, (sn) converges to

§10.
Monotone Sequences and Cauchy Sequences 59
a real number we traditionally write as K.d1d2d3d4 · · ·. For example,
3.3333 · · · represents
lim
n→∞

3 + 3
10 +
3
102 + · · · +
3
10n

.
To calculate this limit, we borrow the following fact about geometric
series from Example 1 on page 96 in §14:
lim
n→∞a(1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn) =
a
1 −r
for
|r| < 1;
(2)
see also Exercise 9.18. In our case, a = 3 and r =
1
10, so 3.3333 · · ·
represents
3
1−1
10 = 10
3 , as expected. Similarly, 0.9999 · · · represents
lim
n→∞

 9
10 +
9
102 + · · · +
9
10n

=
9
10
1 −1
10
= 1.
Thus 0.9999 · · · and 1.0000 · · · are diﬀerent decimal expansions that
represent the same real number!
The converse of the preceding discussion also holds. That is, every
nonnegative real number x has at least one decimal expansion. This
will be proved, along with some related results, in §16.
Unbounded monotone sequences also have limits.
10.4 Theorem.
(i) If (sn) is an unbounded increasing sequence, then lim sn =
+∞.
(ii) If (sn) is an unbounded decreasing sequence, then lim sn =
−∞.
Proof
(i) Let (sn) be an unbounded increasing sequence. Let M > 0.
Since the set {sn : n ∈N} is unbounded and it is bounded
below by s1, it must be unbounded above. Hence for some N
in N we have sN > M. Clearly n > N implies sn ≥sN > M,
so lim sn = +∞.
(ii) The proof is similar and is left to Exercise 10.5.

2. Sequences
60
10.5 Corollary.
If (sn) is a monotone sequence, then the sequence either converges,
diverges to +∞, or diverges to −∞. Thus lim sn is always meaningful
for monotone sequences.
Proof
Apply Theorems 10.2 and 10.4.
Let (sn) be a bounded sequence in R; it may or may not converge.
It is apparent from the deﬁnition of limit in 7.1 that the limiting
behavior of (sn) depends only on sets of the form {sn : n > N}. For
example, if lim sn exists, clearly it lies in the interval [uN, vN] where
uN = inf{sn : n > N}
and
vN = sup{sn : n > N};
see Exercise 8.9. As N increases, the sets {sn : n > N} get smaller,
so we have
u1 ≤u2 ≤u3 ≤· · ·
and
v1 ≥v2 ≥v3 ≥· · · ;
see Exercise 4.7(a). By Theorem 10.2 the limits u = limN→∞uN
and v = limN→∞vN both exist, and u ≤v since uN ≤vN for all N.
If lim sn exists then, as noted above, uN ≤lim sn ≤vN for all N,
so we must have u ≤lim sn ≤v. The numbers u and v are useful
whether lim sn exists or not and are denoted lim inf sn and lim sup sn,
respectively.
10.6 Deﬁnition.
Let (sn) be a sequence in R. We deﬁne
lim sup sn = lim
N→∞sup {sn : n > N}
(1)
and
lim inf sn = lim
N→∞inf {sn : n > N}.
(2)
Note that in this deﬁnition we do not restrict (sn) to be bounded.
However, we adopt the following conventions. If (sn) is not bounded
above, sup{sn : n > N} = +∞for all N and we decree lim sup sn =
+∞. Likewise, if (sn) is not bounded below, inf{sn : n > N} = −∞
for all N and we decree lim inf sn = −∞.

§10.
Monotone Sequences and Cauchy Sequences 61
We emphasize lim sup sn need not equal sup{sn : n ∈N}, but
lim sup sn ≤sup{sn : n ∈N}. Some of the values sn may be much
larger than lim sup sn; lim sup sn is the largest value that inﬁnitely
many sn’s can get close to. Similar remarks apply to lim inf sn. These
remarks will be clariﬁed in Theorem 11.8 and §12, where we will give
a thorough treatment of lim inf’s and lim sup’s. For now, we need
a theorem that shows (sn) has a limit if and only if lim inf sn =
lim sup sn.
10.7 Theorem.
Let (sn) be a sequence in R.
(i) If lim sn is deﬁned [as a real number, +∞or −∞], then
lim inf sn = lim sn = lim sup sn.
(ii) If lim inf sn = lim sup sn, then lim sn is deﬁned and lim sn =
lim inf sn = lim sup sn.
Proof
We use the notation uN = inf{sn : n > N}, vN = sup{sn : n > N},
u = lim uN = lim inf sn and v = lim vN = lim sup sn.
(i) Suppose lim sn = +∞. Let M be a positive real number. Then
there is a positive integer N so that
n > N
implies
sn > M.
Then uN = inf{sn : n > N} ≥M. It follows that m > N
implies um ≥M. In other words, the sequence (uN) satisﬁes
the condition deﬁning lim uN = +∞, i.e., lim inf sn = +∞.
Likewise lim sup sn = +∞.
The case lim sn = −∞is handled in a similar manner.
Now suppose lim sn = s where s is a real number. Consider
ϵ > 0. There exists a positive integer N such that |sn −s| < ϵ
for n > N. Thus sn < s + ϵ for n > N, so
vN = sup{sn : n > N} ≤s + ϵ.
Also, m > N implies vm ≤s+ϵ, so lim sup sn = lim vm ≤s+ϵ.
Since lim sup sn ≤s + ϵ for all ϵ > 0, no matter how small, we
conclude lim sup sn ≤s = lim sn. A similar argument shows
lim sn ≤lim inf sn. Since lim inf sn ≤lim sup sn, we infer all

2. Sequences
62
three numbers are equal:
lim inf sn = lim sn = lim sup sn.
(ii) If lim inf sn = lim sup sn = +∞it is easy to show lim sn =
+∞. And if lim inf sn = lim sup sn = −∞it is easy to show
lim sn = −∞. We leave these two special cases to the reader.
Suppose, ﬁnally, that lim inf sn = lim sup sn = s where s is
a real number. We need to prove lim sn = s. Let ϵ > 0. Since
s = lim vN there exists a positive integer N0 such that
|s −sup{sn : n > N0}| < ϵ.
Thus sup{sn : n > N0} < s + ϵ, so
sn < s + ϵ
for all
n > N0.
(1)
Similarly, there exists N1 such that |s −inf{sn : n > N1}| < ϵ,
hence inf{sn : n > N1} > s −ϵ, hence
sn > s −ϵ
for all
n > N1.
(2)
From (1) and (2) we conclude
s −ϵ < sn < s + ϵ
for
n > max{N0, N1},
equivalently
|sn −s| < ϵ
for
n > max{N0, N1}.
This proves lim sn = s as desired.
If (sn) converges, then lim inf sn = lim sup sn by the theorem just
proved, so for large N the numbers sup{sn : n > N} and inf{sn :
n > N} are close together. This implies that all the numbers in the
set {sn : n > N} are close to each other. This leads us to a concept of
great theoretical importance that will be used throughout the book.
10.8 Deﬁnition.
A sequence (sn) of real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
m, n > N implies |sn −sm| < ϵ.
(1)
Compare this deﬁnition with Deﬁnition 7.1.

§10.
Monotone Sequences and Cauchy Sequences 63
10.9 Lemma.
Convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences.
Proof
Suppose lim sn = s. The idea is that, since the terms sn are close to
s for large n, they also must be close to each other; indeed
|sn −sm| = |sn −s + s −sm| ≤|sn −s| + |s −sm|.
To be precise, let ϵ > 0. Then there exists N such that
n > N
implies
|sn −s| < ϵ
2.
Clearly we may also write
m > N
implies
|sm −s| < ϵ
2,
so
m, n > N
implies
|sn −sm| ≤|sn −s| + |s −sm| < ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ.
Thus (sn) is a Cauchy sequence.
10.10 Lemma.
Cauchy sequences are bounded.
Proof
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 9.1. Applying Deﬁnition 10.8
with ϵ = 1 we obtain N in N so that
m, n > N
implies
|sn −sm| < 1.
In particular, |sn −sN+1| < 1 for n > N, so |sn| < |sN+1| + 1 for
n > N. If M = max{|sN+1| + 1, |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sN|}, then |sn| ≤M
for all n ∈N.
The next theorem is very important because it shows that to
verify that a sequence converges it suﬃces to check it is a Cauchy
sequence, a property that does not involve the limit itself.
10.11 Theorem.
A sequence is a convergent sequence if and only if it is a Cauchy
sequence.

2. Sequences
64
Proof
The expression “if and only if” indicates that we have two assertions
to verify: (i) convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences, and (ii)
Cauchy sequences are convergent sequences. We already veriﬁed (i)
in Lemma 10.9. To check (ii), consider a Cauchy sequence (sn) and
note (sn) is bounded by Lemma 10.10. By Theorem 10.7 we need
only show
lim inf sn = lim sup sn.
(1)
Let ϵ > 0. Since (sn) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists N so that
m, n > N
implies
|sn −sm| < ϵ.
In particular, sn < sm + ϵ for all m, n > N. This shows sm + ϵ is an
upper bound for {sn : n > N}, so vN = sup{sn : n > N} ≤sm + ϵ
for m > N. This, in turn, shows vN −ϵ is a lower bound for {sm :
m > N}, so vN −ϵ ≤inf{sm : m > N} = uN. Thus
lim sup sn ≤vN ≤uN + ϵ ≤lim inf sn + ϵ.
Since this holds for all ϵ > 0, we have lim sup sn ≤lim inf sn. The
opposite inequality always holds, so we have established (1).
The proof of Theorem 10.11 uses Theorem 10.7, and Theo-
rem 10.7 relies implicitly on the Completeness Axiom 4.4, since
without the completeness axiom it is not clear that lim inf sn and
lim sup sn are meaningful. The completeness axiom assures us that
the expressions sup{sn : n > N} and inf{sn : n > N} in Deﬁni-
tion 10.6 are meaningful, and Theorem 10.2 [which itself relies on
the completeness axiom] assures us that the limits in Deﬁnition 10.6
also are meaningful.
Exercises on lim sup’s and lim inf’s appear in §§11 and 12.

§11
Subsequences
11.1 Deﬁnition.
Suppose (sn)n∈N is a sequence. A subsequence of this sequence is a
sequence of the form (tk)k∈N where for each k there is a positive
integer nk such that
n1 < n2 < · · · < nk < nk+1 < · · ·
(1)
and
tk = snk.
(2)
Thus (tk) is just a selection of some [possibly all] of the sn’s taken
in order.
Here are some alternative ways to approach this concept. Note
that (1) deﬁnes an inﬁnite subset of N, namely {n1, n2, n3, . . .}. Con-
versely, every inﬁnite subset of N can be described by (1). Thus a
subsequence of (sn) is a sequence obtained by selecting, in order, an
inﬁnite subset of the terms.
For a more precise deﬁnition, recall we can view the sequence
(sn)n∈N as a function s with domain N; see §7. For the subset
{n1, n2, n3, . . .}, there is a natural function σ [lower case Greek sigma]
given by σ(k) = nk for k ∈N. The function σ “selects” an inﬁnite
subset of N, in order. The subsequence of s corresponding to σ is
simply the composite function t = s ◦σ. That is,
tk = t(k) = s ◦σ(k) = s(σ(k)) = s(nk) = snk
for
k ∈N.
(3)
Thus a sequence t is a subsequence of a sequence s if and only if
t = s ◦σ for some increasing function σ mapping N into N. We will
usually suppress the notation σ and often suppress the notation t

§11.
Subsequences 67
also. Thus the phrase “a subsequence (snk) of (sn)” will refer to the
subsequence deﬁned by (1) and (2) or by (3), depending upon your
point of view.
Example 1
Let (sn) be the sequence deﬁned by sn = n2(−1)n. The positive terms
of this sequence comprise a subsequence. In this case, the sequence
(sn) is
(−1, 4, −9, 16, −25, 36, −49, 64, . . .)
and the subsequence is
(4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144, . . .).
More precisely, the subsequence is (snk)k∈N where nk=2k so
that snk=(2k)2(−1)2k=4k2. The selection function σ is given by
σ(k)=2k.

It is evident that n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 3, n4 = 6, n5 = 7, n6 = 8,
n7 = 9, n8 = 12, n9 = 13, etc. We won’t need a formula for nk,
but here is one: nk = k + 2⌊k
4⌋for k ≥1, where ⌊x⌋is the “ﬂoor
function,” i.e., ⌊x⌋is the largest integer less than or equal to x, for
x ∈R.
After some reﬂection, the next theorem will seem obvious, but
it is good to have a complete proof that covers all situations. The
proof is a little bit complicated, but we will apply the theorem several
times rather than having to recreate a similar proof several times.5
Thus it is important to understand the proof.
5In the ﬁrst edition of this book, we did create similar proofs instead.

2. Sequences

11.2 Theorem.
Let (sn) be a sequence.
(i) If t is in R, then there is a subsequence of (sn) converging to t
if and only if the set {n ∈N : |sn −t| < ϵ} is inﬁnite for all
ϵ > 0.
(ii) If the sequence (sn) is unbounded above, it has a subsequence
with limit +∞.
(iii) Similarly, if (sn) is unbounded below, a subsequence has limit
−∞.
In each case, the subsequence can be taken to be monotonic.6
Proof
The forward implications =⇒in (i)–(iii) are all easy to check. For
example, if limk snk = t and ϵ > 0, then all but ﬁnitely many of the
nks are in {n ∈N : |sn −t| < ϵ}. We focus on the other implications.
(i) First suppose the set {n ∈N : sn = t} is inﬁnite. Then
there are subsequences (snk)k∈N such that snk = t for all
k. Such subsequences of (sn) are boring monotonic sequences
converging to t.
Henceforth, we assume {n ∈N : sn = t} is ﬁnite. Then
{n ∈N : 0 < |sn −t| < ϵ}
is inﬁnite for all
ϵ > 0.
Since these sets equal
{n ∈N : t −ϵ < sn < t} ∪{n ∈N : t < sn < t + ϵ},
and these sets get smaller as ϵ →0, we have
{n ∈N : t −ϵ < sn < t}
is inﬁnite for all
ϵ > 0,
(1)
or
{n ∈N : t < sn < t + ϵ}
is inﬁnite for all
ϵ > 0;
(2)
otherwise, for suﬃciently small ϵ > 0, the sets in both (1)
and (2) would be ﬁnite.
We assume (1) holds, and leave the case that (2) holds
to the reader. We will show how to deﬁne or construct
6This will be proved easily here, but is also a consequence of the more general
Theorem 11.4.

≤snk < t
for

(3)
Speciﬁcally, we will assume n1, n2, . . . , nk−1 have been selected
satisfying (3) and show how to select nk. This will give us an
inﬁnite increasing sequence (nk)k∈N and hence a subsequence
(snk) of (sn) satisfying (3). Since we will have snk−1 ≤snk
for all k, this subsequence will be monotonically increasing.
Since (3) also will imply t −1
k ≤snk < t for all k, we will have
limk snk = t; compare Exercise 8.5(a) on page 44.
A construction like the one described above, and executed
below, is called an “inductive deﬁnition” or “deﬁnition by in-
duction,” even though the validity of the process is not a direct
consequence of Peano’s axiom N5 in §1.7
Here is the construction. Select n1 so that t −1 < sn1 <
t; this is possible by (1). Suppose n1, n2, . . . , nk−1 have been
selected so that
n1 < n2 < · · · < nk−1
(4)
and

(5)
Using (1) with ϵ = max{snk−1, t−1
k}, we can select nk > nk−1
satisfying (5) for j = k, so that (3) holds for k. The procedure
deﬁnes the sequence (nk)k∈N. This completes the proof of (i),
and is the crux of the full proof.
(ii) Let n1 = 1, say. Given n1 < · · · < nk−1, select nk so that
snk > max{snk−1, k}. This is possible, since (sn) is unbounded
above. The sequence so obtained will be monotonic and have
limit +∞. A similar proof veriﬁes (iii).
7Recursive deﬁnitions of sequences, which ﬁrst appear in Exercises 9.4–9.6, can
be viewed as simple examples of deﬁnitions by induction.

2. Sequences
70
Example 3
It can be shown that the set Q of rational numbers can be listed
as a sequence (rn), though it is tedious to specify an exact formula.
Figure 11.1 suggests such a listing [with repetitions] where r1 = 0,
r2 = 1, r3 = 1
2, r4 = −1
2, r5 = −1, r6 = −2, r7 = −1, etc. Readers
familiar with some set theory will recognize this assertion as “Q
is countable.” This sequence has an amazing property: given any
real number a there exists a subsequence (rnk) of (rn) converging to
a. Since there are inﬁnitely many rational numbers in every interval
(a−ϵ, a+ϵ) by Exercise 4.11, Theorem 11.2 shows that a subsequence
of (rn) converges to a.
Example 4
Suppose (sn) is a sequence of positive numbers such that inf{sn :
n ∈N} = 0. The sequence (sn) need not converge or even be
bounded, but it has a subsequence converging monotonically to 0. By
Theorem 11.2, it suﬃces to show {n ∈N : sn < ϵ} is inﬁnite for each
ϵ > 0. Otherwise, this set would be ﬁnite for some ϵ0 > 0. If the set
is nonempty, then inf{sn : n ∈N} = min{sn : sn < ϵ0} > 0, because
each sn is positive and the set {sn : sn < ϵ0} is ﬁnite. This contra-
dicts our assumption inf{sn : n ∈N} = 0. If the set is empty, then
inf{sn : n ∈N} ≥ϵ0 > 0, again contrary to our assumption.
The next theorem is almost obvious.

11.3 Theorem.
If the sequence (sn) converges, then every subsequence converges to
the same limit.
Proof
Let (snk) denote a subsequence of (sn). Note that nk ≥k for all k.
This is easy to prove by induction; in fact, n1 ≥1 and nk−1 ≥k −1
implies nk > nk−1 ≥k −1 and hence nk ≥k.
Let s = lim sn and let ϵ > 0. There exists N so that n > N
implies |sn −s| < ϵ. Now k > N implies nk > N, which implies
|snk −s| < ϵ. Thus
lim
k→∞snk = s.
Our immediate goal is to prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
which asserts that every bounded sequence has a convergent sub-
sequence. First we prove a theorem about monotonic subsequences.
11.4 Theorem.
Every sequence (sn) has a monotonic subsequence.
Proof
Let’s say that the n-th term is dominant if it is greater than every
term which follows it:
sm < sn
for all
m > n.
(1)
Case 1. Suppose there are inﬁnitely many dominant terms, and
let (snk) be any subsequence consisting solely of dominant terms.
Then snk+1 < snk for all k by (1), so (snk) is a decreasing sequence.
Case 2. Suppose there are only ﬁnitely many dominant terms. Se-
lect n1 so that sn1 is beyond all the dominant terms of the sequence.
Then
given N ≥n1 there exists m > N such that
sm ≥sN.
(2)
Applying (2) with N = n1 we select n2 > n1 such that sn2 ≥sn1.
Suppose n1, n2, . . . , nk−1 have been selected so that
n1 < n2 < · · · < nk−1
(3)

2. Sequences
72
and
sn1 ≤sn2 ≤· · · ≤snk−1.
(4)
Applying (2) with N = nk−1 we select nk > nk−1 such that snk ≥
snk−1. Then (3) and (4) hold with k in place of k −1, the procedure
continues by induction, and we obtain an increasing subsequence
(snk).
The elegant proof of Theorem 11.4 was brought to our attention
by David M. Bloom and is based on a solution in D. J. Newman’s
beautiful book [48].
11.5 Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
Proof
If (sn) is a bounded sequence, it has a monotonic subsequence by
Theorem 11.4, which converges by Theorem 10.2.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is very important and will be
used at critical points in Chap. 3. Our proof, based on Theorem 11.4,
is somewhat nonstandard for reasons we now discuss. Many of the
notions introduced in this chapter make equally good sense in more
general settings. For example, the ideas of convergent sequence,
Cauchy sequence and bounded sequence all make sense for a se-
quence (sn) where each sn belongs to the plane. But the idea of
a monotonic sequence does not carry over. It turns out that the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem also holds in the plane and in many
other settings [see Theorem 13.5], but clearly it would no longer be
possible to prove it directly from an analogue of Theorem 11.4. Since
the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 11.5 generalizes to settings where
Theorem 11.4 makes little sense, in applications we will emphasize
the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 11.5 rather than Theorem 11.4.
We need one more notion, and then we will be able to tie our
various concepts together in Theorem 11.8.
11.6 Deﬁnition.
Let (sn) be a sequence in R. A subsequential limit is any real number
or symbol +∞or −∞that is the limit of some subsequence of (sn).

§11.
Subsequences 73
When a sequence has a limit s, then all subsequences have limit
s, so {s} is the set of subsequential limits. The interesting case is
when the original sequence does not have a limit. We return to some
of the examples discussed after Deﬁnition 11.1.
Example 5
Consider (sn) where sn = n2(−1)n. The subsequence of even terms
diverges to +∞, and the subsequence of odd terms diverges to −∞.
All subsequences that have a limit diverge to +∞or −∞, so that
{−∞, +∞} is exactly the set of subsequential limits of (sn).
Example 6
Consider the sequence an = sin(nπ
3 ) in Example 2. This sequence
takes each of the values 1

√
3, 0 and −1

√
3 an inﬁnite number of
times. The only convergent subsequences are constant from some
term on, and {−1
2
√
3, 0, 1
2
√
3} is the set of subsequential limits of
(an). If nk = 3k, then ank = 0 for all k ∈N and obviously
limk→∞ank = 0. If nk = 6k + 1, then ank =

limk→∞ank =

3. And if nk = 6k + 4, then limk→∞ank =

√
3.
Example 7
Let (rn) be a list of all rational numbers. It was shown in Example 3
that every real number is a subsequential limit of (rn). Also, +∞
and −∞are subsequential limits; see Exercise 11.7. Consequently,
R ∪{−∞, +∞} is the set of subsequential limits of (rn).
Example 8
Let bn = n[1+(−1)n] for n ∈N. Then bn = 2n for even n and bn = 0
for odd n. Thus the 2-element set {0, +∞} is the set of subsequential
limits of (bn).
We now turn to the connection between subsequential limits and
lim sup’s and lim inf’s.
11.7 Theorem.
Let (sn) be any sequence. There exists a monotonic subsequence
whose limit is lim sup sn, and there exists a monotonic subsequence
whose limit is lim inf sn.

2. Sequences
74
Proof
If (sn) is not bounded above, then by Theorem 11.2(ii), a monotonic
subsequence of (sn) has limit +∞= lim sup sn. Similarly, if (sn)
is not bounded below, a monotonic subsequence has limit −∞=
lim inf sn.
The remaining cases are that (sn) is bounded above or is bounded
below. These cases are similar, so we only consider the case that (sn)
is bounded above, so that lim sup sn is ﬁnite. Let t = lim sup sn, and
consider ϵ > 0. There exists N0 so that
sup{sn : n > N} < t + ϵ
for
N ≥N0.
In particular, sn < t + ϵ for all n > N0. We now claim
{n ∈N : t −ϵ < sn < t + ϵ}
is inﬁnite.
(1)
Otherwise, there exists N1 > N0 so that sn ≤t−ϵ for n > N1. Then
sup{sn : n > N} ≤t−ϵ for N ≥N1, so that lim sup sn < t, a contra-
diction. Since (1) holds for each ϵ > 0, Theorem 11.2(i) shows that
a monotonic subsequence of (sn) converges to t = lim sup sn.
11.8 Theorem.
Let (sn) be any sequence in R, and let S denote the set of
subsequential limits of (sn).
(i) S is nonempty.
(ii) sup S = lim sup sn and inf S = lim inf sn.
(iii) lim sn exists if and only if S has exactly one element, namely
lim sn.
Proof
(i) is an immediate consequence of Theorem 11.7.
To prove (ii), consider any limit t of a subsequence (snk) of (sn).
By Theorem 10.7 we have t = lim infk snk = lim supk snk. Since
nk ≥k for all k, we have {snk : k > N} ⊆{sn : n > N} for each N
in N. Therefore
lim inf
n
sn ≤lim inf
k
snk = t = lim sup
k
snk ≤lim sup
n
sn.
This inequality holds for all t in S; therefore
lim inf sn ≤inf S ≤sup S ≤lim sup sn.

§11.
Subsequences 75
Theorem 11.7 shows that lim inf sn and lim sup sn both belong to S.
Therefore (ii) holds.
Assertion (iii) is simply a reformulation of Theorem 10.7.
Theorems 11.7 and 11.8 show that lim sup sn is exactly the largest
subsequential limit of (sn), and lim inf sn is exactly the smallest sub-
sequential limit of (sn). This makes it easy to calculate lim sup’s and
lim inf’s.
We return to the examples given before Theorem 11.7.
Example 9
If sn = n2(−1)n, then S = {−∞, +∞} as noted in Example 5.
Therefore lim sup sn = sup S = +∞and lim inf sn = inf S =
−∞.
Example 10
If an = sin(nπ
3 ), then S = {−1

Example 11
If (rn) denotes a list of all rational numbers, then the set R ∪
{−∞, +∞} is the set of subsequential limits of (rn). Consequently
we have lim sup rn = +∞and lim inf rn = −∞.
Example 12
If bn = n[1 + (−1)n], then lim sup bn = +∞and lim inf bn = 0; see
Example 8.
The next result shows that the set S of subsequential lim-
its always contains all limits of sequences from S. Such sets are
called closed sets. Sets of this sort will be discussed further in the
enrichment §13.
11.9 Theorem.
Let S denote the set of subsequential limits of a sequence (sn). Sup-
pose (tn) is a sequence in S ∩R and that t = lim tn. Then t belongs
to S.

2. Sequences
76
Proof
Suppose t is ﬁnite. Consider the interval (t −ϵ, t + ϵ). Then some tn
is in this interval. Let δ = min{t + ϵ −tn, tn −t + ϵ}, so that
(tn −δ, tn + δ) ⊆(t −ϵ, t + ϵ).
Since tn is a subsequential limit, the set {n ∈N : sn ∈(tn−δ, tn+δ)}
is inﬁnite, so the set {n ∈N : sn ∈(t−ϵ, t+ϵ)} is also inﬁnite. Thus,
by Theorem 11.2(i), t itself is a subsequential limit of (sn).
If t = +∞, then clearly the sequence (sn) is unbounded above,
so a subsequence of (sn) has limit +∞by Theorem 11.2(ii). Thus
+∞is also in S. A similar argument applies if t = −∞.

If sup S is in S, it’s suﬃcient to deﬁne sn = sup S for all n.
§12
lim sup’s and lim inf’s
Let (sn) be any sequence of real numbers, and let S be the set of
subsequential limits of (sn). Recall
lim sup sn = lim
N→∞sup {sn : n > N} = sup S
(*)
and
lim inf sn = lim
N→∞inf {sn : n > N} = inf S.
(**)
The ﬁrst equalities in (*) and (**) are from Deﬁnition 10.6, and
the second equalities are proved in Theorem 11.8. This section is de-
signed to increase the students’ familiarity with these concepts. Most
of the material is given in the exercises. We illustrate the techniques
by proving some results that will be needed later in the text.
12.1 Theorem.
If (sn) converges to a positive real number s and (tn) is any sequence,
then
lim sup sntn = s · lim sup tn.
Here we allow the conventions s · (+∞) = +∞and s · (−∞) = −∞
for s > 0.
Proof
We ﬁrst show
lim sup sntn ≥s · lim sup tn.
(1)
We have three cases. Let β = lim sup tn.
Case 1. Suppose β is ﬁnite.
By Theorem 11.7, there exists a subsequence (tnk) of (tn) such
that limk→∞tnk = β. We also have limk→∞snk = s [by Theo-
rem 11.3], so limk→∞snktnk = sβ. Thus (snktnk) is a subsequence of
(sntn) converging to sβ, and therefore sβ ≤lim sup sntn. [Recall that

§12. lim sup’s and lim inf’s 79
lim sup sntn is the largest possible limit of a subsequence of (sntn).]
Thus (1) holds.
Case 2. Suppose β = +∞.
There exists a subsequence (tnk) of (tn) such that limk→∞tnk =
+∞. Since limk→∞snk = s > 0, Theorem 9.9 shows limk→∞snktnk =
+∞. Hence lim sup sntn = +∞, so (1) clearly holds.
Case 3. Suppose β = −∞.
Since s > 0, the right-hand side of (1) is equal to s·(−∞) = −∞.
Hence (1) is obvious in this case.
We have now established (1) in all cases. For the reversed in-
equality, we resort to a little trick. First note that we may ignore
the ﬁrst few terms of (sn) and assume all sn ̸= 0. Then we can write
lim 1
sn = 1
s by Lemma 9.5. Now we apply (1) with sn replaced by
1
sn
and tn replaced by sntn:
lim sup tn = lim sup

 1
sn

(sntn) ≥

1
s

lim sup sntn,
i.e.,
lim sup sntn ≤s · lim sup tn.
This inequality and (1) prove the theorem.
Example 1
The hypothesis s be positive in Theorem 12.1 cannot be relaxed to
allow s = 0. To see this, consider (sn) and (tn), where sn = −1
n and
tn = −n2 for all n. In this setting, we don’t deﬁne 0·(−∞), but even
if we did, we wouldn’t deﬁne this product to be +∞.
The next theorem will be useful in dealing with inﬁnite series;
see the proof of the Ratio Test 14.8.
12.2 Theorem.
Let (sn) be any sequence of nonzero real numbers. Then we have

2. Sequences
80
Proof
The middle inequality is obvious. The ﬁrst and third inequalities
have similar proofs. We will prove the third inequality and leave the
ﬁrst inequality to Exercise 12.11.
Let α = lim sup |sn|1/n and L = lim sup |sn+1
sn |. We need to prove
α ≤L. This is obvious if L = +∞, so we assume L < +∞. To prove
α ≤L it suﬃces to show
α ≤L1
for any
L1 > L.
(1)
Since
L = lim sup

sn+1
sn
 = lim
N→∞sup

sn+1
sn
 : n > N
	
< L1,
there exists a positive integer N such that
sup

sn+1
sn
 : n ≥N
	
< L1.
Thus

sn+1
sn
 < L1
for
n ≥N.
(2)
Now for n > N we can write
|sn| =

sn
sn−1
 ·

sn−1
sn−2
 · · ·

sN+1
sN
 · |sN|.
There are n −(N + 1) + 1 = n −N fractions here, so applying (2)
we see that
|sn| < Ln−N
1
|sN|
for
n > N.
Since L1 and N are ﬁxed in this argument, a = L−N
1
|sN| is a positive
constant and we may write
|sn| < Ln
1a
for
n > N.
Therefore we have
|sn|1/n < L1a1/n
for
n > N.
Since limn→∞a1/n = 1 by Theorem 9.7(d) on page 48, we conclude
α = lim sup |sn|1/n ≤L1; see Exercise 12.1. Consequently (1) holds
as desired.

§12. lim sup’s and lim inf’s 81
12.3 Corollary.
If lim |sn+1
sn | exists [and equals L], then lim |sn|1/n exists [and
equals L].
Proof
If lim |sn+1
sn | = L, then all four values in Theorem 12.2 are equal to L.
Hence lim |sn|1/n = L; see Theorem 10.7.
Example 2
(a) If L = lim sup sn ̸= ∞, then for every α > L, the set {n :
sn > α} is ﬁnite. If L ̸= −∞, then for every β < L, the set
{n : sn > β} is inﬁnite.
If L ̸= ∞and α > L, the set {n : sn > α} is ﬁnite; otherwise
sup{sn : n > N} > α for all N and hence L = lim sup sn ≥
α > L, a contradiction; see Deﬁnition 10.6. If L ̸= −∞and
β < L, the set {n : sn > β} is inﬁnite; otherwise there exists a
positive integer N0 so that sn ≤β for all n ≥N0, and therefore
sup{sn : n > N} ≤β for all N ≥N0. Then lim sup sn ≤β < L,
a contradiction.
(b) The set {n : sn > lim sup sn} can be inﬁnite. For example,
consider (sn) where sn = 1
n. The set {n : sn < lim inf sn} can
also be inﬁnite; use sn = −1
n.
(c) If L0 = lim inf tn ̸= −∞, then the set {n : tn < β0} is ﬁnite for
β0 < L0. If L0 ̸= ∞, then the set {n : tn < α0} is inﬁnite for
α0 > L0.
This follows from part (a) and Exercise 11.8:
L0 = lim inf tn = −lim sup(−tn) = −L = −lim sup sn,
where sn = −tn and L is as deﬁned in part (a). Now β0 < L0
implies −β0 > −L0 = L, so by part (a),
{n : tn < β0} = {n : −tn > −β0} = {n : sn > −β0}
is ﬁnite.
Similarly, α0 > L0 implies −α0 < L, so
{n : tn < α0} = {n : −tn > −α0} = {n : sn > −α0}
is inﬁnite.
(d) If lim inf sn < lim sup sn, the set
{n : lim inf sn ≤sn ≤lim sup sn}
can be empty. Use, for example, sn = (−1)n(1 + 1
n).

* Some Topological Concepts in Metric
Spaces
In this book we are restricting our attention to analysis on R. Ac-
cordingly, we have taken full advantage of the order properties of R
and studied such important notions as lim sup’s and lim inf’s. In §3
we brieﬂy introduced a distance function on R. Most of our analy-
sis could have been based on the notion of distance, in which case
it becomes easy and natural to work in a more general setting. For
example, analysis on the k-dimensional Euclidean spaces Rk is im-
portant, but these spaces do not have the useful natural ordering
that R has, unless of course k = 1.

13.1 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a set, and suppose d is a function deﬁned for all pairs (x, y)
of elements from S satisfying
D1. d(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈S and d(x, y) > 0 for distinct x, y in S.
D2. d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈S.
D3. d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈S.
Such a function d is called a distance function or a metric on S.
A metric space S is a set S together with a metric on it. Properly
speaking, the metric space is the pair (S, d) since a set S may well
have more than one metric on it; see Exercise 13.1.
Example 1
As in Deﬁnition 3.4, let dist(a, b) = |a −b| for a, b ∈R. Then dist is
a metric on R. Note Corollary 3.6 gives D3 in this case. As remarked
there, the inequality
dist(a, c) ≤dist(a, b) + dist(b, c)
is called the triangle inequality. In fact, for any metric d, property
D3 is called the triangle inequality.
Example 2
The space of all k-tuples
x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk)
where
xj ∈R
for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k,
is called k-dimensional Euclidean space and written Rk. As noted in
Exercise 13.1, Rk has several metrics on it. The most familiar metric
is the one that gives the ordinary distance in the plane R2 or in
3-space R3:
d(x, y) =
⎡
⎣
k

j=1
(xj −yj)2
⎤
⎦
1/2
for
x, y ∈Rk.
[The summation notation  is explained in 14.1.] Obviously this
function d satisﬁes properties D1 and D2. The triangle inequality
D3 is not so obvious. For a proof, see for example [53, §6.1] or
[62, 1.37].

§13.
* Some Topological Concepts in Metric Spaces 85
13.2 Deﬁnition.
A sequence (sn) in a metric space (S, d) converges to s in S if
limn→∞d(sn, s) = 0. A sequence (sn) in S is a Cauchy sequence
if for each ϵ > 0 there exists an N such that
m, n > N
implies
d(sm, sn) < ϵ.
The metric space (S, d) is said to be complete if every Cauchy
sequence in S converges to some element in S.
Since the Completeness Axiom 4.4 deals with least upper bounds,
the word “complete” now appears to have two meanings. However,
these two uses of the term are very closely related and both reﬂect the
property that the space is complete, i.e., has no gaps. Theorem 10.11
asserts that the metric space (R, dist) is a complete metric space, and
the proof uses the Completeness Axiom 4.4. We could just as well
have taken as an axiom the completeness of (R, dist) as a metric space
and proved the least upper bound property in 4.4 as a theorem. We
did not do so because the concept of least upper bound in R seems
to us more fundamental than the concept of Cauchy sequence.
We will prove Rk is complete. But we have a notational problem,
since we like subscripts for sequences and for coordinates of points
in Rk. When there is a conﬂict, we will write (x(n)) for a sequence
instead of (xn). In this case,
x(n) = (x(n)
1 , x(n)
2 , . . . , x(n)
k ).
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the metric in Rk is always as given in
Example 2.
13.3 Lemma.
A sequence (x(n)) in Rk converges if and only if for each j =
1, 2, . . . , k, the sequence (x(n)
j
) converges in R. A sequence (x(n))
in Rk is a Cauchy sequence if and only if each sequence (x(n)
j
) is a
Cauchy sequence in R.
Proof
The proof of the ﬁrst assertion is left to Exercise 13.2(b). For the
second assertion, we ﬁrst observe for x, y in Rk and j = 1, 2, . . . , k,
|xj −yj| ≤d(x, y) ≤
√
k max{|xj −yj| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k}.

2. Sequences
86
Suppose (x(n)) is a Cauchy sequence in Rk, and consider ﬁxed j.
If ϵ > 0, there exists N such that
m, n > N
implies
d(x(m), x(n)) < ϵ.
From the ﬁrst inequality in (1) we see that
m, n > N
implies
|x(m)
j
−x(n)
j
| < ϵ,
so (x(n)
j
) is a Cauchy sequence in R.
Now suppose each sequence (x(n)
j
) is a Cauchy sequence in R. Let
ϵ > 0. For j = 1, 2, . . . , k, there exist Nj such that
m, n > Nj
implies
|x(m)
j
−x(n)
j
| <
ϵ
√
k
.
If N = max{N1, N2, . . . , Nk}, then by the second inequality in (1),
m, n > N
implies
d(x(m), x(n)) < ϵ,
i.e., (x(n)) is a Cauchy sequence in Rk.
13.4 Theorem.
Euclidean k-space Rk is complete.
Proof
Consider a Cauchy sequence (x(n)) in Rk. By Lemma 13.3, (x(n)
j
)
is a Cauchy sequence in R for each j. Hence by Theorem 10.11,
(x(n)
j
) converges to some real number xj. By Lemma 13.3 again, the
sequence (x(n)) converges, in fact to x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk).
We now prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for Rk; compare
Theorem 11.5. A set S in Rk is bounded if there exists M > 0 such
that
max{|xj| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k} ≤M
for all
x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk) ∈S.
13.5 Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
Every bounded sequence in Rk has a convergent subsequence.
Proof
Let (x(n)) be a bounded sequence in Rk. Then each sequence (x(n)
j
)
is bounded in R. By Theorem 11.5, we may replace (x(n)) by a

§13.
* Some Topological Concepts in Metric Spaces 87
subsequence such that (x(n)
1 ) converges. By the same theorem, we
may replace (x(n)) by a subsequence of the subsequence such that
(x(n)
2 ) converges. Of course, (x(n)
1 ) still converges by Theorem 11.3.
Repeating this argument k times, we obtain a sequence (x(n)) so
that each sequence (x(n)
j
) converges, j = 1, 2, . . . , k. This sequence
represents a subsequence of the original sequence, and it converges
in Rk by Lemma 13.3.
13.6 Deﬁnition.
Let (S, d) be a metric space. Let E be a subset of S. An element
s0 ∈E is interior to E if for some r > 0 we have
{s ∈S : d(s, s0) < r} ⊆E.
We write E◦for the set of points in E that are interior to E. The
set E is open in S if every point in E is interior to E, i.e., if E = E◦.
13.7 Discussion.
One can show [Exercise 13.4]
(i) S is open in S [trivial].
(ii) The empty set ∅is open in S [trivial].
(iii) The union of any collection of open sets is open.
(iv) The intersection of ﬁnitely many open sets is again an open
set.
Our study of Rk and the exercises suggest that metric spaces are
fairly general and useful objects. When one is interested in conver-
gence of certain objects [such as points or functions], there is often
a metric that assists in the study of the convergence. But sometimes
no metric will work and yet there is still some sort of convergence no-
tion. Frequently the appropriate vehicle is what is called a topology.
This is a set S for which certain subsets are decreed to be open sets.
In general, all that is required is that the family of open sets satisﬁes
(i)–(iv) above. In particular, the open sets deﬁned by a metric form a
topology. We will not pursue this abstract theory. However, because
of this abstract theory, concepts that can be deﬁned in terms of open
sets [see Deﬁnitions 13.8, 13.11, and 22.1] are called topological, hence
the title of this section.

Let (S, d) be a metric space. A subset E of S is closed if its comple-
ment S \ E is an open set. In other words, E is closed if E = S \ U
where U is an open set.
Because of (iii) in Discussion 13.7, the intersection of any collec-
tion of closed sets in closed [Exercise 13.5]. The closure E−of a set
E is the intersection of all closed sets containing E. The boundary
of E is the set E−\ E◦; points in this set are called boundary points
of E.
To get a feel for these notions, we state some easy facts and leave
the proofs as exercises.
13.9 Proposition.
Let E be a subset of a metric space (S, d).
(a) The set E is closed if and only if E = E−.
(b) The set E is closed if and only if it contains the limit of every
convergent sequence of points in E.
(c) An element is in E−if and only if it is the limit of some
sequence of points in E.
(d) A point is in the boundary of E if and only if it belongs to the
closure of both E and its complement.
Example 3
In R, open intervals (a, b) are open sets. Closed intervals [a, b] are
closed sets. The interior of [a, b] is (a, b). The boundary of both (a, b)
and [a, b] is the two-element set {a, b}.
Every open set in R is the union of a disjoint sequence of open
intervals [Exercise 13.7]. A closed set in R need not be the union of
a disjoint sequence of closed intervals and points; such a set appears
in Example 5.
No open interval (a, b) or closed interval [a, b], with a < b, can
be written as the disjoint union of two or more closed intervals, each
having more than one point. This is proved in Theorem 21.11.
Example 4
In Rk, open balls {x : d(x, x0) < r} are open sets, and closed balls
{x : d(x, x0) ≤r} are closed sets. The boundary of each of these

§13.
* Some Topological Concepts in Metric Spaces 89
sets is {x : d(x, x0) = r}. In the plane R2, the sets
{(x1, x2) : x1 > 0}
and
{(x1, x2) : x1 > 0 and x2 > 0}
are open. If > is replaced by ≥, we obtain closed sets. Many sets
are neither open nor closed. For example, [0, 1) is neither open nor
closed in R, and {(x1, x2) : x1 > 0 and x2 ≥0} is neither open nor
closed in R2.
13.10 Theorem.
Let (Fn) be a decreasing sequence [i.e., F1 ⊇F2 ⊇· · ·] of closed
bounded nonempty sets in Rk. Then F = ∩∞
n=1Fn is also closed,
bounded and nonempty.
Proof
Clearly F is closed and bounded. It is the nonemptiness that
needs proving! For each n, select an element xn in Fn. By the
Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 13.5, a subsequence (xnm)∞
m=1 of (xn)
converges to some element x0 in Rk. To show x0 ∈F, it suf-
ﬁces to show x0 ∈Fn0 with n0 ﬁxed. If m ≥n0, then nm ≥n0,
so xnm ∈Fnm ⊆Fn0. Hence the sequence (xnm)∞
m=n0 consists of
points in Fn0 and converges to x0. Thus x0 belongs to Fn0 by (b) of
Proposition 13.9.
Example 5
Here is a famous nonempty closed set in R called the Cantor set.
Pictorially, F = ∩∞
n=1Fn where Fn are sketched in Fig. 13.1. The
Cantor set has some remarkable properties. The sum of the lengths of
the intervals comprising Fn is (2
3)n−1 and this tends to 0 as n →∞.
Yet the intersection F is so large that it cannot be written as a
sequence; in set-theoretic terms it is “uncountable.” The interior
of F is the empty set, so F is equal to its boundary. For more details,
see [62, 2.44], or [31, 6.62].
13.11 Deﬁnition.
Let (S, d) be a metric space. A family U of open sets is said to be an
open cover for a set E if each point of E belongs to at least one set
in U, i.e.,
E ⊆

{U : U ∈U}.

2. Sequences

FIGURE 13.1
A subcover of U is any subfamily of U that also covers E. A cover
or subcover is ﬁnite if it contains only ﬁnitely many sets; the sets
themselves may be inﬁnite.
A set E is compact if every open cover of E has a ﬁnite subcover
of E.
This rather abstract deﬁnition is very important in advanced
analysis; see, for example, [30]. In Rk, compact sets are nicely
characterized, as follows.
13.12 Heine-Borel Theorem.
A subset E of Rk is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Proof
Suppose E is compact. For each m ∈N, let Um consist of all x in
Rk such that
max{|xj| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k} < m.
The family U = {Um : m ∈N} is an open cover of E [it covers Rk!],
so a ﬁnite subfamily of U covers E. If Um0 is the largest member of
the subfamily, then E ⊆Um0. It follows that E is bounded. To show
E is closed, consider any point x0 in Rk \ E. For m ∈N, let
Vm =

x ∈Rk : d(x, x0) > 1
m
	
.

§13.
* Some Topological Concepts in Metric Spaces 91
Then each Vm is open in Rk and V = {Vm : m ∈N} covers E since
∪∞
m=1Vm = Rk \ {x0}. Since E can be covered by ﬁnitely many Vm,
for some m0 we have
E ⊂

x ∈Rk : d(x, x0) > 1
m0
	
.
Thus {x ∈Rk : d(x, x0) <
1
m0} ⊆Rk \ E, so that x0 is interior to
Rk \E. Since x0 in Rk \E was arbitrary, Rk \E is an open set. Hence
E is a closed set.
Now suppose E is closed and bounded. Since E is bounded, E is
a subset of some set F having the form
F = {x ∈Rk : |xj| ≤m
for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k}.
As noted in Exercise 13.12, it suﬃces to prove F is compact. We do
so in the next proposition after some preparation.
The set F in the last proof is a k-cell because it has the following
form. There exist closed intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], . . . , [ak, bk] so that
F = {x ∈Rk : xj ∈[aj, bj]
for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k},
which is sometimes written as
F = [a1, b1] × [a2, b2] × · · · × [ak, bk],
so it is a k-dimensional box in Rk. Thus a 2-cell in R2 is a closed
rectangle. A 3-cell in R3 is called a “rectangular parallelepiped.” The
diameter of F is
δ =
⎡
⎣
k

j=1
(bj −aj)2
⎤
⎦
1/2
;
that is, δ = sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈F}. Using midpoints cj = 1
2(aj +bj)
of [aj, bj], we see that F is a union of 2k k-cells each having diameter
δ
2. If this remark is not clear, consider ﬁrst the cases k = 2 and k = 3.
13.13 Proposition.
Every k-cell F in Rk is compact.
Proof
Assume F is not compact. Then there exists an open cover U of F, no
ﬁnite subfamily of which covers F. Let δ denote the diameter of F.

2. Sequences
92
As noted above, F is a union of 2k k-cells having diameter δ
2. At least
one of these 2k k-cells, which we denote by F1, cannot be covered
by ﬁnitely many sets from U. Likewise, F1 contains a k-cell F2 of
diameter δ
4 which cannot be covered by ﬁnitely many sets from U.
Continuing in this fashion, we obtain a sequence (Fn) of k-cells such
that
F1 ⊇F2 ⊇F3 ⊇· · · ;
(1)
Fn has diameter δ · 2−n;
(2)
Fn cannot be covered by ﬁnitely many sets from U.
(3)
By Theorem 13.10, the intersection ∩∞
n=1Fn contains a point x0. This
point belongs to some set U0 in U. Since U0 is open, there exists r > 0
so that
{x ∈Rk : d(x, x0) < r} ⊆U0.
It follows that Fn ⊆U0 provided δ · 2−n < r, but this contradicts (3)
in a dramatic way.
Since R = R1, the preceding results apply to R.
Example 6
Let E be a nonempty subset of a metric space (S, d). Consider the
function d(E, x) = inf{d(y, x) : y ∈E} for x ∈S. This function
satisﬁes |d(E, x1) −d(E, x2)| ≤d(x1, x2) for x1, x2 in S.
We show that if E is compact and if E ⊆U for some open subset
U of S, then for some δ > 0 we have
{x ∈S : d(E, x) < δ} ⊆U.
(1)
For each x ∈E, we have
{y ∈S : d(y, x) < rx} ⊆U
for some
rx > 0.
(2)
The open balls {y ∈S : d(y, x) < rx/2} cover E, so a ﬁnite subfamily
also covers E. I.e., there are x1, . . . , xn in E so that
E ⊆

y ∈S : d(y, xk) < rk

,
where we write rk for rxk. Now let δ =
1
2 min{r1, . . . , rn}. To
prove (1), consider x ∈S and suppose d(E, x) < δ. Then for some

Exercises 93
y ∈E, we have d(y, x) < δ. Moreover, d(y, xk) <
rk
2
for some
k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Therefore, for this k we have
d(x, xk) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, xk) < δ + rk
2 ≤rk
2 + rk
2 = rk.
Thus, by (2) applied to x = xk, we see that x belongs to U. Hence (1)
holds.

Series
Our thorough treatment of sequences allows us to now quickly obtain
the basic properties of inﬁnite series.
14.1 Summation Notation.
The notation n
k=m ak is shorthand for the sum am+am+1+· · ·+an.
The symbol “” instructs us to sum and the decorations “k = m”
and “n” tell us to sum the summands obtained by successively sub-
stituting m, m+1, . . . , n for k. For example, 5
k=2
1
k2+k is shorthand
for
1
22 + 2 +
1
32 + 3 +
1
42 + 4 +
1
52 + 5 = 1
6 + 1
12 + 1
20 + 1
30
and n
k=0 2−k is shorthand for 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + · · · + 1
2n .
The symbol ∞
n=m an is shorthand for am + am+1 + am+2 + · · ·,
although we have not yet assigned meaning to such an inﬁnite sum.
We now do so.
14.2 Inﬁnite Series.
To assign meaning to ∞
n=m an, we consider the sequences (sn)∞
n=m
of partial sums:
sn = am + am+1 + · · · + an =
n

k=m
ak.
The inﬁnite series ∞
n=m an is said to converge provided the sequence
(sn) of partial sums converges to a real number S, in which case we
deﬁne ∞
n=m an = S. Thus
∞

n=m
an = S
means
lim sn = S
or
lim
n→∞

n

k=m
ak

= S.
A series that does not converge is said to diverge. We say that
∞
n=m an diverges to +∞and we write ∞
n=m an = +∞provided
lim sn = +∞; a similar remark applies to −∞. The symbol ∞
n=m an
has no meaning unless the series converges, or diverges to +∞or
−∞. Often we will be concerned with properties of inﬁnite series
but not their exact values or precisely where the summation begins,
in which case we may write  an rather than ∞
n=m an.

2. Sequences
96
If the terms an of an inﬁnite series  an are all nonnegative,
then the partial sums (sn) form an increasing sequence, so Theo-
rems 10.2 and 10.4 show that  an either converges, or diverges
to +∞. In particular,  |an| is meaningful for any sequence (an)
whatever. The series  an is said to converge absolutely or to be ab-
solutely convergent if  |an| converges. Absolutely convergent series
are convergent, as we shall see in Corollary 14.7.
Example 1
A series of the form ∞
n=0 arn for constants a and r is called a
geometric series. These are the easiest series to sum. For r ̸= 1, the
partial sums sn are given by
n

k=0
ark = a1 −rn+1
1 −r
.
(1)
This identity can be veriﬁed by mathematical induction or by mul-
tiplying both sides by 1 −r, in which case the right hand side equals
a −arn+1 and the left side becomes
(1 −r)
n

k=0
ark =

k=0
ark −
n

k=0
ark+1
= a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn
−(ar + ar2 + · · · + arn + arn+1)
= a −arn+1.
For |r| < 1, we have limn→∞rn+1 = 0 by Theorem 9.7(b) on page 48,
so from (1) we have limn→∞sn =
a
1−r. This proves
∞

n=0
arn =
a
1 −r
if
|r| < 1.
(2)
If a ̸= 0 and |r| ≥1, then the sequence (arn) does not converge to
0, so the series  arn diverges by Corollary 14.5 below.
Example 2
Formula (2) of Example 1 and the next result are very important
and both should be used whenever possible, even though we will not
prove (1) below until the next section. Consider a ﬁxed positive real

∞

n=1

np
converges if and only if
p > 1.
(1)
In particular, for p ≤1, we can write  1/np = +∞. The exact
values of the series for p > 1 are not easy to determine. Here are
some remarkable formulas that can be shown by techniques [Fourier
series or complex variables, to name two possibilities] that will not
be covered in this text.

Similar formulas hold for ∞

np when p is any even integer, but
no such elegant formulas are known for p odd. In particular, no such
formula is known for ∞
n=1
1
n3 though of course this series converges
and can be approximated as closely as desired.
It is worth emphasizing that it is often easier to prove limits exist
or series converge than to determine their exact values. In the next
section we will show without much diﬃculty that  1
np converges for
all p > 1, but it is a lot harder to show the sum is π2
6 when p = 2
and no one knows exactly what the sum is for p = 3.
14.3 Deﬁnition.
We say a series  an satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion if its sequence
(sn) of partial sums is a Cauchy sequence [see Deﬁnition 10.8]:
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists a number
N
such that
m, n > N
implies
|sn −sm| < ϵ.
(1)
Nothing is lost in this deﬁnition if we impose the restriction n > m.
Moreover, it is only a notational matter to work with m −1 where
m ≤n instead of m where m < n. Therefore (1) is equivalent to
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists a number
N
such that
n ≥m > N
implies
|sn −sm−1| < ϵ.
(2)

2. Sequences
98
Since sn −sm−1 = n
k=m ak, condition (2) can be rewritten
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists a number
N
such that
n ≥m > N
implies

n

k=m
ak
 < ϵ.
(3)
We will usually use version (3) of the Cauchy criterion.
Theorem 10.11 implies the following.
14.4 Theorem.
A series converges if and only if it satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion.
14.5 Corollary.
If a series  an converges, then lim an = 0.
Proof
Since the series converges, (3) in Deﬁnition 14.3 holds. In particu-
lar, (3) in 14.3 holds for n = m; i.e., for each ϵ > 0 there exists a
number N such that n > N implies |an| < ϵ. Thus lim an = 0.
The converse of Corollary 14.5 does not hold as the example
 1/n = +∞shows.
We next give several tests to assist us in determining whether a
series converges. The ﬁrst test is elementary but useful.
14.6 Comparison Test.
Let  an be a series where an ≥0 for all n.
(i) If  an converges and |bn| ≤an for all n, then  bn converges.
(ii) If  an = +∞and bn ≥an for all n, then  bn = +∞.
Proof
(i) For n ≥m we have

n

k=m
bk
 ≤
n

k=m
|bk| ≤
n

k=m
ak;
(1)
the ﬁrst inequality follows from the triangle inequality [Ex-
ercise 3.6(b)]. Since  an converges, it satisﬁes the Cauchy
criterion 14.3(1). It follows from (1) that  bn also satisﬁes
the Cauchy criterion, and hence  bn converges.

§14.
Series 99
(ii) Let (sn) and (tn) be the sequences of partial sums for  an and
 bn, respectively. Since bn ≥an for all n, we obviously have
tn ≥sn for all n. Since lim sn = +∞, we conclude lim tn =
+∞, i.e.,  bn = +∞.
14.7 Corollary.
Absolutely convergent series are convergent.9
Proof
Suppose  bn is absolutely convergent. This means  an converges
where an = |bn| for all n. Then |bn| ≤an trivially, so  bn converges
by 14.6(i).
We next state the Ratio Test which is popular because it is often
easy to use. But it has defects: It isn’t as general as the Root Test.
Moreover, an important result concerning the radius of convergence
of a power series uses the Root Test. Finally, the Ratio Test is worth-
less if some of the an’s equal 0. To review lim sup’s and lim inf’s, see
Deﬁnition 10.6, Theorems 10.7 and 11.8, and §12.
14.8 Ratio Test.
A series  an of nonzero terms
(i) converges absolutely if lim sup |an+1/an| < 1,
(ii) diverges if lim inf |an+1/an| > 1.
(iii) Otherwise lim inf |an+1/an| ≤1 ≤lim sup |an+1/an| and the
test gives no information.
We give the proof after the proof of the Root Test.
Remember that if lim |an+1/an| exists, then it is equal to both
lim sup |an+1/an| and lim inf |an+1/an| and hence the Ratio Test will
give information unless, of course, the limit lim |an+1/an| equals 1.
14.9 Root Test.
Let  an be a series and let α = lim sup |an|1/n. The series  an
(i) converges absolutely if α < 1,
(ii) diverges if α > 1.
9As noted in [35], the proofs of this corollary and the Alternating Series
Theorem 15.3 use the completeness of R.

2. Sequences
100
(iii) Otherwise α = 1 and the test gives no information.
Proof
(i) Suppose α < 1, and select ϵ > 0 so that α + ϵ < 1. Then by
Deﬁnition 10.6 there is a positive integer N such that
α −ϵ < sup{|an|1/n : n > N} < α + ϵ.
In particular, we have |an|1/n < α + ϵ for n > N, so
|an| < (α + ϵ)n
for
n > N.
Since 0 < α+ϵ < 1, the geometric series ∞
n=N+1(α+ϵ)n con-
verges and the Comparison Test shows the series ∞
n=N+1 an
also converges. Then clearly  an converges; see Exercise 14.9.
(ii) If α > 1, then by Theorem 11.7 a subsequence of |an|1/n has
limit α > 1. It follows that |an| > 1 for inﬁnitely many choices
of n. In particular, the sequence (an) cannot possibly converge
to 0, so the series  an cannot converge by Corollary 14.5.
(iii) For each of the series  1
n and  1
n2, α turns out to equal 1
as can be seen by applying Theorem 9.7(c) on page 48.
Since  1
n diverges and  1
n2 converges, the equality α = 1
does not guarantee either convergence or divergence of the
series.
Proof of the Ratio Test
Let α = lim sup |an|1/n. By Theorem 12.2 we have
lim inf

an+1
an
 ≤α ≤lim sup

an+1
an
 .
(1)
If lim sup |an+1/an| < 1, then α < 1 and the series converges by the
Root Test. If lim inf |an+1/an| > 1, then α > 1 and the series diverges
by the Root Test. Assertion 14.8(iii) is veriﬁed by again examining
the series  1/n and  1/n2.
Inequality (1) in the proof of the Ratio Test shows that the Root
Test is superior to the Ratio Test in the following sense: Whenever
the Root Test gives no information [i.e., α = 1] the Ratio Test will
surely also give no information. On the other hand, Example 8 below
gives a series for which the Ratio Test gives no information but

§14. Series 101
which converges by the Root Test. Nevertheless, the tests usually
fail together as the next remark shows.
14.10 Remark.
If the terms an are nonzero and if lim |an+1/an| = 1, then α =
lim sup |an|1/n = 1 by Corollary 12.3, so neither the Ratio Test nor
the Root Test gives information concerning the convergence of  an.
We have three tests for convergence of a series [Comparison, Ra-
tio, Root], and we will obtain two more in the next section. There is
no clearcut strategy advising us which test to try ﬁrst. However, if
the form of a given series  an does not suggest a particular strat-
egy, and if the ratios an+1/an are easy to calculate, one may as well
try the Ratio Test ﬁrst.

n=0(−1/3)n. Here a = 1/9 and r = −1/3, so by (2) of
Example 1 the sum is (1/9)/[1 −(−1/3)] = 1/12.
The series (1) can also be shown to converge by the Comparison
Test, since  1/3n converges by the Ratio Test or by the Root Test.
In fact, if an = (−1/3)n, then lim |an+1/an| = lim sup |an|1/n = 1/3.
Of course, none of these tests will give us the exact value of the
series (1).

so lim |an+1/an| = 1. As noted in 14.10, neither the Ratio Test nor
the Root Test gives any information in this case. Before trying the
Comparison Test we need to decide whether we believe the series
converges or not. Since an is approximately 1/n for large n and since
(1/n) diverges, we expect the series (1) to diverge. Now
n
n2 + 3 ≥
n
n2 + 3n2 =
n
4n2 = 1
4n.
Since (1/n) diverges, (1/4n) also diverges [its partial sums are
sn/4 where sn = n
k=1(1/k)], so (1) diverges by the Comparison
Test.
Example 5
Consider the series

1
n2 + 1.
(1)
As the reader should check, neither the Ratio Rest nor the Root Test
gives any information. The nth term is approximately
1
n2 and in fact
1
n2+1 ≤
1
n2 . Since  1
n2 converges, the series (1) converges by the
Comparison Test.
Example 6
Consider the series
 n
3n .
(1)
If an = n/3n, then an+1/an = (n + 1)/(3n), so lim |an+1/an| =
1/3. Hence the series (1) converges by the Ratio Test. In this case,
applying the Root Test is not much more diﬃcult provided we recall
lim n1/n = 1. It is also possible to show (1) converges by comparing
it with a suitable geometric series.
Example 7
Consider the series

an where an =

2
(−1)n −3
n

(1)
The form of an suggests the Root Test. Since |an|1/n = 1 for even
n and |an|1/n = 1/2 for odd n, we have α = lim sup |an|1/n = 1.

§14. Series 103
So the Root Test gives no information, and the Ratio Test cannot
help either. On the other hand, if we had been alert, we would have
observed an = 1 for even n, so (an) cannot converge to 0. Therefore
the series (1) diverges by Corollary 14.5.
Example 8

2(−1)n−n = 2 + 1

(1)
Let an = 2(−1)n−n. Since an ≤
1
2n−1 for all n, we can quickly conclude
the series converges by the Comparison Test. But our real interest in
this series is that it illustrates the diﬀerence between the Ratio Test
and the Root Test. Since an+1/an = 1/8 for even n and an+1/an = 2
for odd n, we have
1
8 = lim inf

an+1
an
 < 1 < lim sup


Hence the Ratio Test gives no information.
Note that (an)1/n = 2
1
n −1 for even n and (an)1/n = 2−1
n −1 for
odd n. Since lim 2
1
n = lim 2−1
n = 1 by Theorem 9.7(d) on page 48,
we conclude lim(an)1/n = 1
2. Therefore α = lim sup(an)1/n = 1
2 < 1
and the series (1) converges by the Root Test.

use the Comparison Test 14.6(i) to show (1) converges. Since the
terms of the series (1) are not all nonnegative, we will not be able to
use the Comparison Test 14.6(ii) to show (1) diverges. It turns out
that this series converges by the Alternating Series Test 15.3 which
we have deferred to the next section.

Alternating Series and Integral Tests
Sometimes one can check convergence or divergence of series by
comparing the partial sums with familiar integrals. We illustrate.
Example 1
We show  1
n = +∞.
Consider the picture of the function f(x) = 1
x in Fig. 15.1. For
n ≥1 it is evident that

x dx = loge(n + 1).
Since limn→∞loge(n + 1) = +∞, we conclude ∞
n=1

n = +∞.
The series  1
n diverges very slowly. In Example 7 on page 120,
we observe N
n=1
1
n is approximately loge N + 0.5772. Thus for N =
1, 000 the sum is approximately 7.485, and for N = 1, 000, 000 the
sum is approximately 14.393.
Another proof that  1
n diverges was indicated in Exercise 14.14.
However, an integral test is useful to establish the next result.
Example 2
We show  1
n2 converges.
Consider the graph of f(x) =

15.2 Integral Tests.
Here are the conditions under which an integral test is advisable:
(a) The tests in §14 do not seem to apply.
(b) The terms an of the series  an are nonnegative.

2. Sequences
108
(c) There is a nice decreasing function f on [1, ∞) such that f(n) =
an for all n [f is decreasing if x < y implies f(x) ≥f(y)].
(d) The integral of f is easy to calculate or estimate.
If limn→∞
 n
1 f(x) dx = +∞, then the series will diverge just
as in Example 1. If limn→∞
 n
1 f(x) dx < +∞, then the series will
converge just as in Example 2. The interested reader may formulate
and prove the general result [Exercise 15.8].
The following result enables us to conclude that series like
 (−1)n
√n
converge even though they do not converge absolutely. See
Example 9 in §14.
15.3 Alternating Series Theorem.
If a1 ≥a2 ≥· · · ≥an ≥· · · ≥0 and lim an = 0, then the al-
ternating series (−1)n+1an converges. Moreover, the partial sums
sn = n
k=1(−1)k+1ak satisfy |s −sn| ≤an for all n.
The series (−1)nan is called an alternating series because the
signs of the terms alternate between + and −.
Proof
We need to show that the sequence (sn) converges. Note that the
subsequence (s2n) is increasing because s2n+2 −s2n = −a2n+2 +
a2n+1 ≥0. Similarly, the subsequence (s2n−1) is decreasing since
s2n+1 −s2n−1 = a2n+1 −a2n ≤0. We claim
s2m ≤s2n+1
for all
m, n ∈N.
(1)
First note that s2n ≤s2n+1 for all n, because s2n+1−s2n = a2n+1 ≥0.
If m ≤n, then (1) holds because s2m ≤s2n ≤s2n+1. If m ≥n,
then (1) holds because s2n+1 ≥s2m+1 ≥s2m. Thanks to (1), we
see that (s2n) is an increasing subsequence of (sn) bounded above
by each odd partial sum, and (s2n+1) is a decreasing subsequence
of (sn) bounded below by each even partial sum. By Theorem 10.2,
these subsequences converge, say to s and t. Now
t −s = lim
n→∞s2n+1 −lim
n→∞s2n = lim
n→∞(s2n+1 −s2n) = lim
n→∞a2n+1 = 0,
so s = t. It follows that limn sn = s.

§16.
* Decimal Expansions of Real Numbers 109
To check the last claim, note that s2k ≤s ≤s2k+1, so both
s2k+1−s and s−s2k are clearly bounded by s2k+1−s2k = a2k+1 ≤a2k.
So, whether n is even or odd, we have |s −sn| ≤an.

§16
* Decimal Expansions of Real Numbers
We begin by recalling the brief discussion of decimals in Discus-
sion 10.3. There we considered a decimal expansion K.d1d2d3 · · ·,

2. Sequences
110
where K is a nonnegative integer and each digit dj belongs to
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. This expansion represents the real number
K +

which we also can write as

j=1
dj · 10−j.
Thus every such decimal expansion represents a nonnegative real
number. We will prove the converse after we formalize the process
of long division. The development here is based on some suggestions
by Karl Stromberg.
16.1 Long Division.
Consider a/b where a and b are positive integers. Since the K term
above causes no diﬃculty, we assume a < b. We analyze the familiar
long division process which gives a decimal expansion for a/b. Fig-
ure 16.1 shows the ﬁrst few steps where a = 3 and b = 7. If we name
the digits d1, d2, d3, . . . and the remainders r1, r2, r3, . . ., then so far
d1 = 4, d2 = 2 and r1 = 2, r2 = 6. At the next step we divide 7 into
60 = 10 · r2 and obtain 60 = 7 · 8 + 4. The quotient 8 becomes the
third digit d3, we place the product 56 under 60, subtract and obtain
a new remainder 4 = r3. That is, we are calculating the remainder
FIGURE 16.1

§16.
* Decimal Expansions of Real Numbers 111
obtained by dividing 60 by 7. Next we multiply the remainder r3 = 4
by 10 and repeat the process. At each stage
dn ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
rn = 10 · rn−1 −7 · dn
0 ≤rn < 7.
These results hold for n = 1, 2, . . . if we set r0 = 3. In general, we
set r0 = a and obtain
dn ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
(1)
rn = 10 · rn−1 −b · dn
(2)
0 ≤rn < b.
(3)
As we will show, this construction yields:
a
b = d1

(4)
and
a
b = d1

for n ≥2. Since each rn is less than b, we have limn

b = 0, so (5)
shows
a
b =
∞

j=1
dj
10j ;
thus .d1d2d3 · · · is a decimal expansion for a
b .
Now Eq. (4) follows from r1 = 10a −bd1, and we will verify (5)
by mathematical induction. From (2), we have
rn+1 = 10rn −bdn+1,
so
rn
b = 1
10dn+1 + 1
10
rn+1

Substituting this into (5) gives

i.e., (5) holds with n replaced by n + 1. Thus by induction, (5) holds
for all n.

16.2 Theorem.
Every nonnegative real number x has at least one decimal expansion.
Proof
It suﬃces to consider x in [0, 1). The proof will be similar to that for
results in 16.1, starting with Eqs. (4) and (5) in its proof. We will
use the “ﬂoor function” ⌊
⌋on R, where ⌊y⌋is deﬁned to be the
largest integer less than or equal to y, for each y ∈R.
Since 10x < 10, we can write
10x = d1 + x1
where
d1 = ⌊10x⌋
and
x1 ∈[0, 1).
(1)
Note d1 is in {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9} since 10x < 10. Therefore
x = d1
10 + 1
10x1.
(2)
Suppose, for some n ≥1, we have chosen d1, . . . , dn in {0, 1, 2, 3,
. . . , 9} and x1, . . . , xn in [0, 1) so that
x = d1
10 + · · · + dn
10n +
1
10n xn.
(3)
Since 10xn < 10, we can write
10xn = dn+1 + xn+1
where
dn+1 = ⌊10xn⌋, xn+1 ∈[0, 1).
(4)
Solving for xn in (4) and substituting the value in (3), we get
x = d1
10 + · · · + dn+1
10n+1 +
1
10n+1 xn+1.
This completes the induction step. Since limn
1
10n+1 xn+1 = 0, we
conclude
x = lim

have the same value, namely 1. Similarly, 2.75000 · · · and 2.74999 · · ·
are both decimal expansions for 11
4 [Exercise 16.1]. The next theorem
shows this is essentially the only way a number can have distinct
decimal expansions.
16.3 Theorem.
A real number x has exactly one decimal expansion or else x has two
decimal expansions, one ending in a sequence of all 0’s and the other
ending in a sequence of all 9’s.
Proof
We assume x ≥0. If x has decimal expansion K.000 · · · with K > 0,
then it has one other decimal expansion, namely (K −1).999 · · ·. If
x has decimal expansion K.d1d2d3 · · · dr000 · · · where dr ̸= 0, then it
has one other decimal expansion K.d1d2d3 · · · (dr −1)9999 · · ·. The
reader can easily check these claims [Exercise 16.2].
Now suppose x has two distinct decimal expansions K.d1d2d3 · · ·
and L.e1e2e3 · · ·. Suppose K < L. If any dj < 9, then by Exercise 16.3
we have
x < K +



9 · 10−j = K + 1 ≤L ≤x,
a contradiction. It follows that x = K + 1 = L and its decimal
expansions are K.999 · · · and (K + 1).000 · · ·. In the remaining case,
we have K = L. Let
m = min{j : dj ̸= ej}.
We may assume dm < em. If dj < 9 for any j > m, then by
Exercise 16.3,
x < K +

16.5 Theorem.
A real number x is rational if and only if its decimal expansion is
repeating. [Theorem 16.3 shows that if x has two decimal expansions,
they are both repeating.]
Proof
First assume x ≥0 has a repeating decimal expansion x =
K.d1d2 · · · dℓdℓ+1 · · · dℓ+r. Then
x = K +
ℓ

j=1
dj · 10−j + 10−ℓy
where
y = .dℓ+1 · · · dℓ+r,

2. Sequences
116
so it suﬃces to show y is rational. To simplify the notation, we write
y = .e1e2 · · · er.
A little computation shows
y =
r

j=1
ej · 10−j

j=0
(10−r)j
⎤
⎦=
r

j=1
ej · 10−j

10r −1.
Thus y is rational. In fact, if we write e1e2 · · · er for the usual decimal
r−1
j=0 ej · 10r−1−j not the product, then y = e1e2···er
10r−1 ; see Example 3.
Next consider any positive rational, say a
b where a, b ∈N. We
may assume a < b. As we saw in 16.1, a
b is given by the decimal
expansion .d1d2d3 · · · where r0 = a,
dk ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
(1)
rk = 10 · rk−1 −dkb
(2)
0 ≤rk < b,
(3)
for k ≥1. Since a and b are integers, each rk is an integer. Thus (3)
can be written
rk ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , b −1}
for
k ≥0.
(4)
This set has b elements, so the ﬁrst b + 1 remainders rk cannot all
be distinct. That is, there exist integers m ≥0 and p > 0 so that
0 ≤m < m + p ≤b
and
rm = rm+p.
From the construction giving (1)–(3) it is clear that given rk−1, the
integers rk and dk are uniquely determined. Thus
rj = rk
implies
rj+1 = rk+1
and
dj+1 = dk+1.
Since rm = rm+p, we conclude rm+1 = rm+1+p and dm+1 = dm+1+p.
A simple induction shows that the statement
“rk = rk+p
and
dk = dk+p”
holds for all integers k ≥m + 1. Thus the decimal expansion of a
b is
periodic with period p after the ﬁrst m digits. That is,
a
b = .d1d2 · · · dmdm+1 · · · dm+p.

§16.
* Decimal Expansions of Real Numbers 117
Remark. Given rk−1, the uniqueness of rk and dk follows from
the so-called “division algorithm,” which is actually a theorem that
shows the algorithm for division never breaks down. It says that if
b is a positive integer and m ∈Z, then there are unique integers q
and r so that
m = bq + r
and
0 ≤r < b;
q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder. With m =
10 · rk−1 in Theorem 16.5, this yields
10 · rk−1 = bq + r
where
0 ≤r < b.
If we name q = dk and r = rk, then we obtain formula (2) in
Theorem 16.5. For more details, see for example, [60, §3.5].
Example 4
An expansion such as
.101001000100001000001000000100000001000000001000000000100· · ·
represents an irrational number, since it cannot be a repeating
decimal: we’ve arranged for arbitrarily long blocks of 0’s.
Example 5
We do not know the complete decimal expansions of
√
2,
√
3 and
many other familiar irrational numbers, but we know that they
cannot be repeating by virtue of the last theorem.
Example 6
We have claimed π and e are irrational. These facts and many others
are proved in a fascinating book by Ivan Niven [49].
(a) Here is a proof that

(b) We will prove π2 is irrational, from which the irrationality of
π follows; see Exercise 16.10.
The key to the proof that π2 is irrational is the sequence of
integrals In =  π

(x(π−x))n

sin x dx. Thus
In =

Claim 1. There is a sequence (Qn)∞
n=0 of polynomials with
integer coeﬃcients, of degree at most n, satisfying In = Qn(π2)
for all n.
Proof. First, we obtain a recursive relation for In; see (3).
We use integration by parts (Theorem 34.2) twice to show
In =

and (1) holds. For n ≥2, we have
P ′
n(x) = (x(π −x))n−1
(n −1)!
(π −2x) = Pn−1(x)(π −2x),
so, using this for n −1 and the product rule, we have
P ′′
n(x) = Pn−2(x)(π −2x)2 + Pn−1(x)(−2)
= π2Pn−2(x) + Pn−2(x)(−4πx + 4x2) −2Pn−1(x).
Since
Pn−2(x)(−4πx+4x2) = −4· (x(π −x))n−1
(n −2)!
= −4·Pn−1(x)(n−1),
we conclude
P ′′
n(x) = π2Pn−2(x) −[4(n −1) + 2]Pn−1(x).
Therefore
P ′′
n(x) = π2Pn−2(x) −(4n −2)Pn−1(x)
for
n ≥2.
(2)
To prove Claim 1, note that I0 = 2 is clear. Using (1) and
P ′′
1 (x) = −2, we see that I1 = 4. And from (1) and (2), we see
that
In = −π2In−2 + (4n −2)In−1
for
n ≥2.
(3)
Now Claim 1 holds by a simple induction argument, where
Q0 = 2, Q1 = 4, and
Qn(x) = −xQn−2(x) + (4n −2)Qn−1(x)
for
n ≥2.
Claim 2. π2 is irrational.
Proof. Suppose π2 = a/b. Using Claim 1, we see that
each bnIn = bnQn(a/b) is an integer. Since x(π −x) takes its
maximum at π/2, we can write
0 < bnIn = bn

As noted in Exercise 9.15, the right-hand side converges to 0.
So, for large n, the integer bnIn lies in the interval (0, 1), a
contradiction.
This simpliﬁcation of Ivan Niven’s famous short proof
(1947) is due to Zhou and Markov [72]. Zhou and Markov use a
similar technique to prove tan r is irrational for nonzero ratio-
nal r and cos r is irrational if r2 is a nonzero rational. Compare
with results in Niven’s book [49, Chap.2].
(c) It is even more diﬃcult to prove π and e are not algebraic
numbers; see Deﬁnition 2.1. These results are proved in Niven’s
book [49, Theorems 2.12 and 9.11].

is approximately 0.577216. The amazing fact is that no one knows
whether γ is rational or not. Most mathematicians believe γ is irra-
tional. This is because it is “easier” for a number to be irrational,
since repeating decimal expansions are regular. The remark in Ex-
ercise 16.8 hints at another reason it is easier for a number to be
irrational.

Continuity
Most of the calculus involves the study of continuous functions.
In this chapter we study continuous and uniformly continuous
functions.
§17
Continuous Functions
Recall that the salient features of a function f are:
(a) The set on which f is deﬁned, called the domain of f and
written dom(f);
(b) The assignment, rule or formula specifying the value f(x) of f
at each x in dom(f).
We will be concerned with functions f such that dom(f) ⊆R
and such that f is a real-valued function, i.e., f(x) ∈R for all
x ∈dom(f). Properly speaking, the symbol f represents the function
while f(x) represents the value of the function at x. However, a func-
tion is often given by specifying its values and without mentioning its
domain. In this case, the domain is understood to be the natural do-
main: the largest subset of R on which the function is a well deﬁned

real-valued function. Thus “the function f(x) = 1
x” is shorthand for
“the function f given by f(x) = 1
x with natural domain {x ∈R :
x ̸= 0}.” Similarly, the natural domain of g(x) =
√
4 −x2 is [−2, 2]
and the natural domain of csc x =
1
sin x is the set of real numbers x
not of the form nπ, n ∈Z.
In keeping with the approach in this book, we will deﬁne continu-
ity in terms of sequences. We then show our deﬁnition is equivalent
to the usual ϵ–δ deﬁnition.
17.1 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of R. The
function f is continuous at x0 in dom(f) if, for every sequence (xn)
in dom(f) converging to x0, we have limn f(xn) = f(x0). If f is
continuous at each point of a set S ⊆dom(f), then f is said to
be continuous on S. The function f is said to be continuous if it is
continuous on dom(f).
Our deﬁnition implies that the values f(x) are close to f(x0)
when the values x are close to x0. The next theorem says this in
another way. In fact, condition (1) of the next theorem is the ϵ–δ
deﬁnition of continuity given in many calculus books.
17.2 Theorem.
Let f be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of R. Then
f is continuous at x0 in dom(f) if and only if
for each
ϵ > 0
there exists
δ > 0
such that
x ∈dom(f)
and
|x −x0| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ.
(1)
Proof
Suppose (1) holds, and consider a sequence (xn) in dom(f) such that
lim xn = x0. We need to prove lim f(xn) = f(x0). Let ϵ > 0. By (1),
there exists δ > 0 such that
x ∈dom(f)
and
|x −x0| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ.
Since lim xn = x0, there exists N so that
n > N
implies
|xn −x0| < δ.

§17. Continuous Functions 125
It follows that
n > N
implies
|f(xn) −f(x0)| < ϵ.
This proves lim f(xn) = f(x0).
Now assume f is continuous at x0, but (1) fails. Then there exists
ϵ > 0 so that the implication
“x ∈dom(f)
and
|x −x0| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ”
fails for each δ > 0. In particular, the implication
“x ∈dom(f)
and
|x −x0| < 1
n
imply
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ”
fails for each n ∈N. So for each n ∈N there exists xn in dom(f) such
that |xn−x0| < 1
n and yet |f(x0)−f(xn)| ≥ϵ. Thus we have lim xn =
x0, but we cannot have lim f(xn) = f(x0) since |f(x0) −f(xn)| ≥ϵ
for all n. This shows f cannot be continuous at x0, contrary to our
assumption.
As the next example illustrates, it is sometimes easier to work
with the sequential deﬁnition of continuity in Deﬁnition 17.1 than
the ϵ–δ property in Theorem 17.2. However, it is important to get
comfortable with the ϵ–δ property, partly because the deﬁnition of
uniform continuity is more closely related to the ϵ–δ property than
the sequential deﬁnition.
Example 1
Let f(x) = 2x2 + 1 for x ∈R. Prove f is continuous on R by
(a) Using the deﬁnition,
(b) Using the ϵ–δ property of Theorem 17.2.
Solution
(a) Suppose lim xn = x0. Then we have
lim f(xn) = lim[2x2
n + 1] = 2[lim xn]2 + 1 = 2x2
0 + 1 = f(x0)
where the second equality is an application of the limit
Theorems 9.2–9.4. Hence f is continuous at each x0 in R.
(b) Let x0 be in R and let ϵ > 0. We want to show |f(x)−f(x0)| < ϵ
provided |x−x0| is suﬃciently small, i.e., less than some δ. We

3. Continuity
126
observe
|f(x) −f(x0)| = |2x2 + 1 −(2x2
0 + 1)| = |2x2 −2x2
0|
= 2|x −x0| · |x + x0|.
We need to get a bound for |x+x0| that does not depend on x.
We notice that if |x−x0| < 1, say, then |x| < |x0|+1 and hence
|x + x0| ≤|x| + |x0| < 2|x0| + 1. Thus we have
|f(x) −f(x0)| ≤2|x −x0|(2|x0| + 1)
provided |x −x0| < 1. To arrange for 2|x −x0|(2|x0| + 1) < ϵ,
it suﬃces to have |x −x0| <
ϵ
2(2|x0|+1) and also |x −x0| < 1. So
we put
δ = min

1,
ϵ
2(2|x0| + 1)

.
The work above shows |x −x0| < δ implies |f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ,
as desired.
The reason that solution (a) in Example 1 is so much easier is
that the careful analysis was done in proving the limit theorems in §9.
Example 2
Let f(x) = x2 sin( 1
x) for x ̸= 0 and f(0) = 0. The graph of f
in Fig. 17.1 looks continuous. Prove f is continuous at 0.
Solution
Let ϵ > 0. Clearly |f(x) −f(0)| = |f(x)| ≤x2 for all x. Since we
want this to be less than ϵ, we set δ = √ϵ. Then |x −0| < δ implies
x2 < δ2 = ϵ, so
|x −0| < δ
implies
|f(x) −f(0)| < ϵ.
Hence the ϵ–δ property holds and f is continuous at 0.
In Example 2 it would have been equally easy to show that if
lim xn = 0 then lim f(xn) = 0. The function f in Example 2 is also
continuous at the other points of R; see Example 4.
Example 3
Let f(x) = 1
x sin( 1
x2 ) for x ̸= 0 and f(0) = 0. Show f is discontinuous,
i.e., not continuous, at 0.

§17. Continuous Functions 127
FIGURE 17.1
Solution
It suﬃces for us to ﬁnd a sequence (xn) converging to 0 such
that f(xn) does not converge to f(0) = 0. So we will arrange

. Then lim xn = 0 while
lim f(xn) = lim 1
xn = +∞.
Let f be a real-valued function. For k in R, kf signiﬁes the func-
tion deﬁned by (kf)(x) = kf(x) for x ∈dom(f). Also |f| is the
function deﬁned by |f|(x) = |f(x)| for x ∈dom(f). Thus if f is given
by f(x) = √x −4 for x ≥0, then 3f is given by (3f)(x) = 3√x −12
for x ≥0, and |f| is given by |f|(x) = |√x −4| for x ≥0. Here is an
easy theorem.

3. Continuity
128
17.3 Theorem.
Let f be a real-valued function with dom(f) ⊆R. If f is continuous
at x0 in dom(f), then |f| and kf, k ∈R, are continuous at x0.
Proof
Consider a sequence (xn) in dom(f) converging to x0. Since f is
continuous at x0, we have lim f(xn) = f(x0). Theorem 9.2 shows
lim kf(xn) = kf(x0). This proves kf is continuous at x0.
To prove |f| is continuous at x0, we need to prove lim |f(xn)| =
|f(x0)|. This follows from the inequality
||f(xn)| −|f(x0)|| ≤|f(xn) −f(x0)|;
(1)
see Exercise 3.5. [In detail, consider ϵ > 0. Since lim f(xn) = f(x0),
there exists N such that n > N implies |f(xn) −f(x0)| < ϵ. So
by (1),
n > N
implies
||f(xn)| −|f(x0)|| < ϵ;
thus lim |f(xn)| = |f(x0)|.]
We remind readers that if f and g are real-valued functions, then
we can combine f and g to obtain new functions:
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x);
fg(x) = f(x)g(x);
(f/g)(x) = f(x)
g(x);
g ◦f(x) = g(f(x));
max(f, g)(x) = max{f(x), g(x)};
min(f, g)(x) = min{f(x), g(x)}.
The function g ◦f is called the composition of g and f. Each of these
new functions is deﬁned exactly where they make sense. Thus the
domains of f + g, fg, max(f, g) and min(f, g) are dom(f) ∩dom(g),
the domain of f/g is the set dom(f) ∩{x ∈dom(g) : g(x) ̸= 0},
and the domain of g ◦f is {x ∈dom(f) : f(x) ∈dom(g)}. Note
f + g = g + f and fg = gf but that in general f ◦g ̸= g ◦f.
These new functions are continuous if f and g are continuous.
17.4 Theorem.
Let f and g be real-valued functions that are continuous at x0 in R.
Then
(i) f + g is continuous at x0;
(ii) fg is continuous at x0;
(iii) f/g is continuous at x0 if g(x0) ̸= 0.

§17. Continuous Functions 129
Proof
We are given that x0 ∈dom(f) ∩dom(g). Let (xn) be a sequence in
dom(f) ∩dom(g) converging to x0. Then we have lim f(xn) = f(x0)
and lim g(xn) = g(x0). Theorem 9.3 shows
lim(f + g)(xn) = lim[f(xn) + g(xn)] = lim f(xn) + lim g(xn)
= f(x0) + g(x0) = (f + g)(x0),
so f + g is continuous at x0. Likewise, Theorem 9.4 implies fg is
continuous at x0.
To handle f/g we assume g(x0) ̸= 0 and consider a sequence
(xn) in dom(f) ∩{x ∈dom(g) : g(x) ̸= 0} converging to x0. Then
Theorem 9.6 shows
lim
f
g

(xn) = lim f(xn)
g(xn) = f(x0)
g(x0
=
f
g

(x0);
so f/g is continuous at x0.
17.5 Theorem.
If f is continuous at x0 and g is continuous at f(x0), then the
composite function g ◦f is continuous at x0.
Proof
We are given that x0 ∈dom(f) and f(x0) ∈dom(g). Let (xn) be a
sequence in {x ∈dom(f) : f(x) ∈dom(g)} converging to x0. Since f
is continuous at x0, we have lim f(xn) = f(x0). Since the sequence
(f(xn)) converges to f(x0) and g is continuous at f(x0), we also have
lim g(f(xn)) = g(f(x0)); that is, lim g◦f(xn) = g◦f(x0). Hence g◦f
is continuous at x0.
Example 4
For this example, let us accept as known that polynomial functions
and the functions sin x, cos x and ex are continuous on R. Then
4ex and | sin x| are continuous on R by Theorem 17.3. The function
sin x + 4ex + x3 is continuous on R by (i) of Theorem 17.4. The
function x4 sin x is continuous on R by (ii) of Theorem 17.4, and
(iii) of Theorem 17.4 shows tan x =
sin x
cos x is continuous wherever
cos x ̸= 0, i.e., at all x not of the form nπ + π
2, n ∈Z. Theorem 17.5
tells us esin x and cos(ex) are continuous on R; for example, cos(ex) =

3. Continuity
130
g ◦f(x) where f(x) = ex and g(x) = cos x. Several applications of
Theorems 17.3–17.5 will show x2 sin( 1
x) and 1
x sin( 1
x2 ) are continuous
at all nonzero x in R.
Example 5
Let f and g be continuous at x0 in R. Prove max(f, g) is continuous
at x0.
Solution
We could prove this using Deﬁnition 17.1 or the ϵ–δ condition in
Theorem 17.2. However, we illustrate a useful technique by reducing
the problem to results we have already established. First, observe
max(f, g) = 1
2(f + g) + 1
2|f −g|,
which shows that the function max(f, g) is a combination of func-
tions to which our theorems apply. This equation holds because
max{a, b} = 1
2(a + b) + 1
2|a −b| is true for all a, b ∈R, a fact which
is easily checked by considering the cases a ≥b and a < b. By The-
orem 17.4(i), f + g and f −g are continuous at x0. Hence |f −g|
is continuous at x0 by Theorem 17.3. Then 1
2(f + g) and 1
2|f −g|
are continuous at x0 by Theorem 17.3, and another application of
Theorem 17.4(i) shows max(f, g) is continuous at x0.

A is postage needed for the ﬁrst ounce, and B is the postage needed
for each additional ounce. Show P is discontinuous at every positive
integer. Because postage rates tend to increase over time, A and B
are actually functions.
§18
Properties of Continuous Functions
A real-valued function f is said to be bounded if {f(x) : x ∈dom(f)}
is a bounded set, i.e., if there exists a real number M such that
|f(x)| ≤M for all x ∈dom(f).
18.1 Theorem.
Let f be a continuous real-valued function on a closed interval [a, b].
Then f is a bounded function. Moreover, f assumes its maximum
and minimum values on [a, b]; that is, there exist x0, y0 in [a, b] such
that f(x0) ≤f(x) ≤f(y0) for all x ∈[a, b].
Proof
Assume f is not bounded on [a, b]. Then to each n ∈N there
corresponds an xn ∈[a, b] such that |f(xn)| > n. By the Bolzano-
Weierstrass Theorem 11.5, (xn) has a subsequence (xnk) that
converges to some real number x0. The number x0 also must be-
long to the closed interval [a, b], as noted in Exercise 8.9. Since f is
continuous at x0, we have limk→∞f(xnk) = f(x0), but we also have
limk→∞|f(xnk)| = +∞, which is a contradiction. It follows that f is
bounded.
Now let M = sup{f(x) : x ∈[a, b]}; M is ﬁnite by the preced-
ing paragraph. For each n ∈N there exists yn ∈[a, b] such that
M −1
n < f(yn) ≤M. Hence we have lim f(yn) = M. By the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there is a subsequence (ynk) of (yn)
converging to a limit y0 in [a, b]. Since f is continuous at y0, we

3. Continuity
134
have f(y0) = limk→∞f(ynk). Since (f(ynk))k∈N is a subsequence of
(f(yn))n∈N, Theorem 11.3 shows limk→∞f(ynk) = limn→∞f(yn) =
M and therefore f(y0) = M. Thus f assumes its maximum at y0.
The last paragraph applies to the function −f, so −f assumes
its maximum at some x0 ∈[a, b]. It follows easily that f assumes its
minimum at x0; see Exercise 18.1.
Theorem 18.1 is used all the time, at least implicitly, in solv-
ing maximum-minimum problems in calculus because it is taken for
granted that the problems have solutions, namely that a continuous
function on a closed interval actually takes on a maximum and a
minimum. If the domain is not a closed interval, one needs to be
careful; see Exercise 18.3.
Theorem 18.1 is false if the closed interval [a, b] is replaced by an
open interval. For example, f(x) = 1
x is continuous but unbounded
on (0, 1). The function x2 is continuous and bounded on (−1, 1), but
it does not have a maximum value on (−1, 1).
18.2 Intermediate Value Theorem.
If f is a continuous real-valued function on an interval I, then f has
the intermediate value property on I: Whenever a, b ∈I, a < b and y
lies between f(a) and f(b) [i.e., f(a) < y < f(b) or f(b) < y < f(a)],
there exists at least one x in (a, b) such that f(x) = y.
Proof
We assume f(a) < y < f(b); the other case is similar. Let S =
{x ∈[a, b] : f(x) < y}; see Fig. 18.1. Since a belongs to S, the set
S is nonempty, so x0 = sup S represents a number in [a, b]. For each
n ∈N, x0 −1
n is not an upper bound for S, so there exists sn ∈S
such that x0 −1
n < sn ≤x0. Thus lim sn = x0 and, since f(sn) < y
for all n, we have
f(x0) = lim f(sn) ≤y.
(1)
Let tn = min{b, x0 + 1
n}. Since x0 ≤tn ≤x0 + 1
n we have lim tn = x0.
Each tn belongs to [a, b] but not to S, so f(tn) ≥y for all n. Therefore
we have
f(x0) = lim f(tn) ≥y;
this and (1) imply f(x0) = y.

FIGURE 18.1
18.3 Corollary.
If f is a continuous real-valued function on an interval I, then the
set f(I) = {f(x) : x ∈I} is also an interval or a single point.
Proof
The set J = f(I) has the property:
y0, y1 ∈J
and
y0 < y < y1
imply
y ∈J.
(1)
If inf J < sup J, then such a set J will be an interval. In fact, we will
show
inf J < y < sup J
implies
y ∈J,
(2)
so J is an interval with endpoints inf J and sup J; inf J and sup J
may or may not belong to J and they may or may not be ﬁnite.
To prove (2) from (1), consider inf J < y < sup J. Then there
exist y0, y1 in J so that y0 < y < y1. Thus y ∈J by (1).
Example 1
Let f be a continuous function mapping [0, 1] into [0, 1]. In other
words, dom(f) = [0, 1] and f(x) ∈[0, 1] for all x ∈[0, 1]. Show f has
a ﬁxed point, i.e., a point x0 ∈[0, 1] such that f(x0) = x0; x0 is left
“ﬁxed” by f.

3. Continuity
136
FIGURE 18.2
Solution
The graph of f lies in the unit square; see Fig. 18.2. Our assertion
is equivalent to the assertion that the graph of f crosses the y = x
line, which is almost obvious.
A rigorous proof involves a little trick. Consider g(x) = f(x) −x
which is also a continuous function on [0, 1]. Since g(0) = f(0)−0 =
f(0) ≥0 and g(1) = f(1) −1 ≤1 −1 = 0, the Intermediate Value
theorem shows g(x0) = 0 for some x0 ∈[0, 1]. Then obviously we
have f(x0) = x0.
Example 2
Show that if y > 0 and m ∈N, then y has a positive mth root.
Solution
The function f(x) = xm is continuous [Exercise 17.5]. There exists
b > 0 so that y ≤bm; in fact, if y ≤1 let b = 1 and if y > 1 let
b = y. Thus f(0) < y ≤f(b) and the Intermediate Value theorem
implies f(x) = y for some x in (0, b]. So y = xm and x is an mth
root of y.
Let us analyze the function f(x) = xm in Example 2 more closely.
It is a strictly increasing function on [0, ∞):
0 ≤x1 < x2
implies
xm
1 < xm
2 .

§18.
Properties of Continuous Functions 137
Therefore f is one-to-one and each nonnegative y has exactly one
nonnegative mth root. This assures us that the notation y1/m is
unambiguous. In fact, f −1(y) = y1/m is the inverse function of f
since f −1 ◦f(x) = x for x ∈dom(f) and f ◦f −1(y) = y for y ∈
dom(f −1). Since f(x) = xm is continuous, the function f −1(y) =
y1/m is continuous on [0, ∞) by the next theorem. Note that for
m = 2 this result appears in Exercise 17.4.
18.4 Theorem.
Let f be a continuous strictly increasing function on some interval
I. Then f(I) is an interval J by Corollary 18.3 and f −1 represents
a function with domain J. The function f −1 is a continuous strictly
increasing function on J.
Proof
The function f −1 is easily shown to be strictly increasing. Since f −1
maps J onto I, the next theorem shows f −1 is continuous.
18.5 Theorem.
Let g be a strictly increasing function on an interval J such that g(J)
is an interval I. Then g is continuous on J.
Proof
Consider x0 in J. We assume x0 is not an endpoint of J; tiny changes
in the proof are needed otherwise. Then g(x0) is not an endpoint of
I, so there exists ϵ0 > 0 such that (g(x0) −ϵ0, g(x0) + ϵ0) ⊆I.
Let ϵ > 0. Since we only need to verify the ϵ–δ property of The-
orem 17.2 for small ϵ, we may assume ϵ < ϵ0. Then there exist
x1, x2 ∈J such that g(x1) = g(x0) −ϵ and g(x2) = g(x0) + ϵ.
Clearly we have x1 < x0 < x2. Also, if x1 < x < x2, then
g(x1) < g(x) < g(x2), hence g(x0) −ϵ < g(x) < g(x0) + ϵ, and hence
|g(x) −g(x0)| < ϵ. Now if we put δ = min{x2 −x0, x0 −x1}, then
|x −x0| < δ implies x1 < x < x2 and hence |g(x) −g(x0)| < ϵ.
Theorem 18.5 provides a partial converse to the Intermediate
Value theorem, since it tells us that a strictly increasing func-
tion with the intermediate value property is continuous. However,
Exercise 18.12 shows that a function can have the intermediate value
property without being continuous.

3. Continuity
138
18.6 Theorem.
Let f be a one-to-one continuous function on an interval I. Then
f is strictly increasing [x1 < x2 implies f(x1) < f(x2)] or strictly
decreasing [x1 < x2 implies f(x1) > f(x2)].
Proof
First we show
if a < b < c in I, then f(b) lies between f(a) and f(c).
(1)
If not, then f(b) > max{f(a), f(c)}, say. Select y so that f(b) > y >
max{f(a), f(c)}. By the Intermediate Value Theorem 18.2 applied
to [a, b] and to [b, c], there exist x1 ∈(a, b) and x2 ∈(b, c) such that
f(x1) = f(x2) = y. This contradicts the one-to-one property of f.
Now select any a0 < b0 in I and suppose, say, that f(a0) < f(b0).
We will show f is strictly increasing on I. By (1) we have
f(x) < f(a0)
for
x < a0
[since
x < a0 < b0],
f(a0) < f(x) < f(b0)
for
a0 < x < b0,
f(b0) < f(x)
for
x > b0
[since
a0 < b0 < x].
In particular,
f(x) < f(a0)
for all
x < a0,
(2)
f(a0) < f(x)
for all
x > a0.
(3)
Consider any x1 < x2 in I. If x1 ≤a0 ≤x2, then f(x1) < f(x2)
by (2) and (3). If x1 < x2 < a0, then f(x1) < f(a0) by (2), so by (1)
we have f(x1) < f(x2). Finally, if a0 < x1 < x2, then f(a0) < f(x2),
so that f(x1) < f(x2).

§19
Uniform Continuity
Let f be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of R. The-
orem 17.2 tells us that f is continuous on a set S ⊆dom(f) if and
only if
for each x0 ∈S and ϵ > 0 there is δ > 0 so that
x ∈dom(f) and |x −x0| < δ imply |f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ.
(*)
The choice of δ depends on ϵ > 0 and on the point x0 in S.

3. Continuity
140
Example 1
We verify (*) for the function f(x) =
1
x2 on (0, ∞). Let x0 > 0 and
ϵ > 0. We need to show |f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ for |x −x0| suﬃciently
small. Note that
f(x) −f(x0) = 1
x2 −1
x2

(1)
If |x −x0| < x0
2 , then we have |x| > x0
2 , |x| < 3x0
2
and |x0 + x| < 5x0
2 .
These observations and (1) show that if |x −x0| < x0
2 , then
|f(x) −f(x0)| < |x0 −x| · 5x0
2
(x0
2 )2x2

= 10|x0 −x|

.
Thus if we set δ = min{ x0
2 , x3
0ϵ
10 }, then
|x −x0| < δ
implies
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ϵ.
This establishes (*) for f on (0, ∞). Note that δ depends on both ϵ
and x0. Even if ϵ is ﬁxed, δ gets small when x0 is small. This shows
that our choice of δ deﬁnitely depends on x0 as well as ϵ, though this
may be because we obtained δ via sloppy estimates. As a matter of
fact, in this case δ must depend on x0 as well as ϵ; see Example 3.
Figure 19.1 shows how a ﬁxed ϵ requires smaller and smaller δ as x0
approaches 0. [In the ﬁgure, δ1 signiﬁes a δ that works for x1 and ϵ,
δ2 signiﬁes a δ that works for x2 and ϵ, etc.]
It turns out to be very useful to know when the δ in condition
(*) can be chosen to depend only on ϵ > 0 and S, so that δ does
not depend on the particular point x0. Such functions are said to
be uniformly continuous on S. In the deﬁnition, the points x and x0
play a symmetric role, so we will call them x and y.
19.1 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a real-valued function deﬁned on a set S ⊆R. Then f is
uniformly continuous on S if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
x, y ∈S and |x −y| < δ imply |f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ.
(1)
We will say f is uniformly continuous if f is uniformly continuous
on dom(f).

§19.
Uniform Continuity 141
FIGURE 19.1
Note that if a function is uniformly continuous on its domain,
then it is continuous on its domain. This should be obvious; if it isn’t,
Theorem 17.2 and Deﬁnition 19.1 should be carefully scrutinized.
Note also that uniform continuity is a property concerning a function
and a set [on which it is deﬁned]. It makes no sense to speak of a
function being uniformly continuous at each point.
Example 2
We show f(x) =
1
x2 is uniformly continuous on any set of the form
[a, ∞) where a > 0. Here a is ﬁxed. Let ϵ > 0. We need to show there
exists δ > 0 such that
x ≥a,
y ≥a
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ.
(1)
As in formula (1) of Example 1, we have
f(x) −f(y) = (y −x)(y + x)
x2y2
.

3. Continuity
142
If we can show y+x
x2y2 is bounded on [a, ∞) by a constant M, then we
will take δ =
ϵ
M . But we have
y + x
x2y2 =
1
x2y +
1
xy2 ≤1
a3 + 1
a3 = 2
a3 ,
so we set δ = ϵa3
2 . It is now straightforward to verify (1). In fact,
x ≥a, y ≥a and |x −y| < δ imply
|f(x) −f(y)| = |y −x|(y + x)|
x2y2
< δ

x2y +

a3 = ϵ.
We have shown f is uniformly continuous on [a, ∞) since δ depends
only on ϵ and the set [a, ∞).
Example 3
The function f(x) =
1
x2 is not uniformly continuous on the set (0, ∞)
or even on the set (0, 1).
We will prove this by directly violating the deﬁnition of uni-
form continuity. The squeamish reader may skip this demonstration
and wait for the easy proof in Example 6. We will show (1) in
Deﬁnition 19.1 fails for ϵ = 1; that is
for each δ > 0 there exist x, y in (0, 1) such that
|x −y| < δ and yet |f(x) −f(y)| ≥1.
(1)
[Actually, for this function, (1) in Deﬁnition 19.1 fails for all ϵ > 0.]
To show (1) it suﬃces to take y = x + δ
2 and arrange for
f(x) −f

x + δ

 ≥1.
(2)
[The motivation for this maneuver is to go from two variables, x
and y, in (1) to one variable, x, in (2).] By (1) in Example 1, (2) is
equivalent to
1 ≤(x + δ
2 −x)(x + δ
2 + x)
x2(x + δ
2)2
=
δ(2x + δ
2)
2x2(x + δ
2)2 .
(3)
It suﬃces to prove (1) for δ < 1
2. To apply (3), let us try x = δ for
no particular reason. Then
δ(2δ + δ

2δ2(δ + δ
2)2 = 5δ2/2
9δ4/2 =

§19.
Uniform Continuity 143
We were lucky! To summarize, we have shown that if 0 < δ < 1
2, then
|f(δ) −f(δ + δ
2)| > 1, so (1) holds with x = δ and y = δ + δ
2.
Example 4
Is the function f(x) = x2 uniformly continuous on [−7, 7]? To see if it
is, consider ϵ > 0. Note that |f(x)−f(y)| = |x2−y2| = |x−y|·|x+y|.
Since |x + y| ≤14 for x, y in [−7, 7], we have
|f(x) −f(y)| ≤14|x −y|
for
x, y ∈[−7, 7].
Thus if δ =
ϵ
14, then
x, y ∈[−7, 7]
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ.
We have shown that f is uniformly continuous on [−7, 7]. A similar
proof would work for f(x) = x2 on any closed interval. How-
ever, these results are not accidents as the next important theorem
shows.
19.2 Theorem.
If f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then f is uniformly
continuous on [a, b].
Proof
Assume f is not uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Then there exists
ϵ > 0 such that for each δ > 0 the implication
“|x −y| < δ
implies
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ”
fails. That is, for each δ > 0 there exist x, y ∈[a, b] such that |x−y| <
δ and yet |f(x) −f(y)| ≥ϵ. Thus for each n ∈N there exist xn, yn
in [a, b] such that |xn −yn| < 1
n and yet |f(xn) −f(yn)| ≥ϵ. By
the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 11.5, a subsequence (xnk) of (xn)
converges. Moreover, if x0 = limk→∞xnk, then x0 belongs to [a, b];
see Exercise 8.9. Clearly we also have x0 = limk→∞ynk. Since f is
continuous at x0, we have
f(x0) = lim
k→∞f(xnk) = lim
k→∞f(ynk),
so
lim
k→∞[f(xnk) −f(ynk)] = 0.
Since |f(xnk) −f(ynk)| ≥ϵ for all k, we have a contradiction. We
conclude f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].

3. Continuity
144
The preceding proof used only two properties of [a, b]:
(a) Boundedness, so the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem applies;
(b) A convergent sequence in [a, b] converges to an element in [a, b].
As noted prior to Theorem 11.9, sets with property (b) are called
closed sets. Hence Theorem 19.2 has the following generalization. If
f is continuous on a closed and bounded set S, then f is uniformly
continuous on S. See also Theorems 21.4 and 13.12 that appear in
enrichment sections.
Example 5
In view of Theorem 19.2, the following functions are uniformly
continuous on the indicated sets: x73 on [−13, 13], √x on [0, 400],
x17 sin(ex) −e4x cos 2x on [−8π, 8π], and
1
x6 on [1
4, 44].
19.3 Discussion.
Example 5 illustrates the power of Theorem 19.2, but it still may
not be clear why uniform continuity is worth studying. One of the
important applications of uniform continuity concerns the integrabil-
ity of continuous functions on closed intervals. To see the relevance
of uniform continuity, consider a continuous nonnegative real-valued
function f on [0, 1]. For n ∈N and i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1, let
Mi,n = sup

f(x) : x ∈
 i
n, i+1
n
	
and
mi,n = inf

f(x) : x ∈
 i
n, i+1
n
	
.
Then the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Fig. 19.2a equals
Un = 1
n
n−1

i=0
Mi,n
and the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Fig. 19.2b equals
Ln = 1
n
n−1

i=0
mi,n.
The function f would turn out to be Riemann integrable provided
the numbers Un and Ln are close together for large n, i.e., if
lim
n→∞(Un −Ln) = 0;
(1)

§19.
Uniform Continuity 145
FIGURE 19.2
see Exercise 32.6. Moreover, we would have  1
0 f(x)dx = lim Un =
lim Ln. Relation (1) may appear obvious from Fig. 19.2, but uniform
continuity is needed to prove it. First note
0 ≤Un −Ln = 1
n
n−1

i=0
(Mi,n −mi,n)
for all n. Let ϵ > 0. By Theorem 19.2, f is uniformly continuous on
[0, 1], so there exists δ > 0 such that
x, y ∈[0, 1]
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ.
(2)
Select N so that
1
N < δ. Consider n > N; for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1,
Theorem 18.1 shows there exist xi, yi in [ i
n, i+1
n ] satisfying f(xi) =
mi,n and f(yi) = Mi,n. Since |xi −yi| ≤1
n < 1
N < δ, (2) shows
Mi,n −mi,n = f(yi) −f(xi) < ϵ,
so
0 ≤Un −Ln = 1
n
n−1

i=0
(Mi,n −mi,n) < 1
n
n−1

i=0
ϵ = ϵ.
This proves (1) as desired.
The next two theorems show uniformly continuous functions have
nice properties.

3. Continuity
146
19.4 Theorem.
If f is uniformly continuous on a set S and (sn) is a Cauchy sequence
in S, then (f(sn)) is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof
Let (sn) be a Cauchy sequence in S and let ϵ > 0. Since f is uniformly
continuous on S, there exists δ > 0 so that
x, y ∈S
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ.
(1)
Since (sn) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists N so that
m, n > N
implies
|sn −sm| < δ.
From (1) we see that
m, n > N
implies
|f(sn) −f(sm)| < ϵ.
This proves (f(sn)) is also a Cauchy sequence.
Example 6
We show f(x) =
1
x2 is not uniformly continuous on (0, 1). Let sn = 1
n
for n ∈N. Then (sn) is obviously a Cauchy sequence in (0, 1). Since
f(sn) = n2, (f(sn)) is not a Cauchy sequence. Therefore f cannot
be uniformly continuous on (0, 1) by Theorem 19.4.
The next theorem involves extensions of functions. We say a
function ˜f is an extension of a function f if
dom(f) ⊆dom( ˜f)
and
f(x) = ˜f(x)
for all
x ∈dom(f).
Example 7
Let f(x) = x sin( 1
x) for x ∈(0, 1
π]. The function deﬁned by
˜f(x) =
 x sin( 1
x)
for
0 < x ≤1
π
0
for
x = 0
is an extension of f. Note that dom(f) = (0, 1
π] and dom( ˜f) = [0, 1
π].
In this case, ˜f is a continuous extension of f. See Fig. 19.3 as well as
Exercises 17.3(f) and 17.9(c).

§19.
Uniform Continuity 147
FIGURE 19.3
Example 8
Let g(x) = sin( 1
x) for x ∈(0, 1
π]. The function g can be extended
to a function ˜g with domain [0, 1
π] in many ways, but ˜g will not be
continuous. See Fig. 19.4.
The function f in Example 7 is uniformly continuous [since ˜f
is], and f extends to a continuous function on the closed interval.
The function g in Example 8 does not extend to a continuous func-
tion on the closed interval, and it turns out that g is not uniformly
continuous. These examples illustrate the next theorem.

3. Continuity
148
FIGURE 19.4
19.5 Theorem.
A real-valued function f on (a, b) is uniformly continuous on (a, b)
if and only if it can be extended to a continuous function ˜f on [a, b].
Proof
First suppose f can be extended to a continuous function ˜f on [a, b].
Then ˜f is uniformly continuous on [a, b] by Theorem 19.2, so clearly
f is uniformly continuous on (a, b).
Suppose now that f is uniformly continuous on (a, b). We need to
deﬁne ˜f(a) and ˜f(b) so that the extended function will be continuous.

§19.
Uniform Continuity 149
It suﬃces for us to deal with ˜f(a). We make two claims:
if (sn) is a sequence in (a, b) converging
to a, then (f(sn)) converges,
(1)
and
if (sn) and (tn) are sequences in (a, b) converging
to a, then lim f(sn) = lim f(tn).
(2)
Momentarily accepting (1) and (2) as valid, we deﬁne
˜f(a) = lim f(sn) for any sequence
(sn) in (a, b) converging to a.
(3)
Assertion (1) guarantees the limit exists, and assertion (2) guaran-
tees this deﬁnition is unambiguous. The continuity of ˜f at a follows
directly from (3); see Exercise 17.15.
To prove (1), note that (sn) is a Cauchy sequence, so (f(sn)) is
also a Cauchy sequence by Theorem 19.4. Hence (f(sn)) converges
by Theorem 10.11. To prove (2) we create a third sequence (un) such
that (sn) and (tn) are both subsequences of (un). In fact, we simply
interleaf (sn) and (tn):
(un)∞
n=1 = (s1, t1, s2, t2, s3, t3, s4, t4, s5, t5, . . .).
It is evident that lim un = a, so lim f(un) exists by (1). Theorem 11.3
shows the subsequences (f(sn)) and (f(tn)) of (f(un)) both converge
to lim f(un), so lim f(sn) = lim f(tn).
Example 9
Let h(x) = sin x
x
for x ̸= 0. The function ˜h deﬁned on R by
˜h(x) =
 sin x
x
for
x ̸= 0
1
for
x = 0
is an extension of h. Clearly h and ˜h are continuous at all x ̸= 0. It
turns out that ˜h is continuous at x = 0 [see below], so h is uniformly
continuous on (a, 0) and (0, b) for any a < 0 < b by Theorem 19.5.
In fact, ˜h is uniformly continuous on R [Exercise 19.11].
We cannot prove the continuity of ˜h at 0 in this book because
we do not give a deﬁnition of sin x. The continuity of ˜h at 0 reﬂects

3. Continuity

FIGURE 19.5
the fact that sin x is diﬀerentiable at 0 and its derivative there is
cos(0) = 1, i.e.,
1 = lim
x→0
sin x −sin 0
x −0
= lim
x→0
sin x
x ;
see Fig. 19.5. The proof of this depends on how sin x is deﬁned;
see the brief discussion in 37.12. For a discussion of this limit and
L’Hospital’s rule, see Example 1 in §30.
Here is another useful criterion that implies uniform continuity.
19.6 Theorem.
Let f be a continuous function on an interval I [I may be bounded
or unbounded ]. Let I
◦be the interval obtained by removing from I
any endpoints that happen to be in I. If f is diﬀerentiable on I
◦and
if f ′ is bounded on I
◦, then f is uniformly continuous on I.
Proof
For this proof we need the Mean Value theorem, which can be found
in most calculus texts or later in this book [Theorem 29.3].
Let M be a bound for f ′ on I so that |f ′(x)| ≤M for all x.
Let ϵ > 0 and let δ =
ϵ
M . Consider a, b ∈I where a < b and
|b −a| < δ. By the Mean Value theorem, there exists x ∈(a, b) such
that f ′(x) = f(b)−f(a)
b−a
, so
|f(b) −f(a)| = |f ′(x)| · |b −a| ≤M|b −a| < Mδ = ϵ.
This proves the uniform continuity of f on I.

Exercises 151
Example 10
Let a > 0 and consider f(x) =
1
x2. Since f ′(x) = −2
x3 we have
|f ′(x)| ≤

a3 on [a, ∞). Hence f is uniformly continuous on [a, ∞) by
Theorem 19.6. For a direct proof of this fact, see Example 2.

by f ∗(x) = sup{f(y) : a ≤y ≤x}, for x ∈[a, b], is an increasing
continuous function on [a, b].
§20
Limits of Functions
A function f is continuous at a point a provided the values f(x) are
near the value f(a) for x near a [and x ∈dom(f)]. See Deﬁnition 17.1
and Theorem 17.2. It would be reasonable to view f(a) as the limit
of the values f(x), for x near a, and to write limx→a f(x) = f(a). In
this section we formalize this notion. This section is needed for our
careful study of derivatives in Chap. 5, but it may be deferred until
then.
We will be interested in ordinary limits, left-handed and right-
handed limits and inﬁnite limits. In order to handle these various
concepts eﬃciently and also to emphasize their common features,
we begin with a very general deﬁnition, which is not a standard
deﬁnition.
20.1 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a subset of R, let a be a real number or symbol ∞or −∞
that is the limit of some sequence in S, and let L be a real number
or symbol +∞or −∞. We write limx→aS f(x) = L if
f is a function deﬁned on S,
(1)
and
for every sequence (xn) in S with limit a,
we have limn→∞f(xn) = L.
(2)
The expression “limx→aS f(x)” is read “limit, as x tends to a along S,
of f(x).”
20.2 Remarks.
(a) From Deﬁnition 17.1 we see that a function f is continuous at
a in dom(f) = S if and only if limx→aS f(x) = f(a).

3. Continuity
154
(b) Observe that limits, when they exist, are unique. This follows
from (2) of Deﬁnition 20.1, since limits of sequences are unique,
a fact that is veriﬁed at the end of §7.
We now deﬁne the various standard limit concepts for functions.
20.3 Deﬁnition.
(a) For a ∈R and a function f we write limx→a f(x) = L provided
limx→aS f(x) = L for some set S = J \ {a} where J is an
open interval containing a. limx→a f(x) is called the [two-sided]
limit of f at a. Note f need not be deﬁned at a and, even if f
is deﬁned at a, the value f(a) need not equal limx→a f(x). In
fact, f(a) = limx→a f(x) if and only if f is deﬁned on an open
interval containing a and f is continuous at a.
(b) For a ∈R and a function f we write limx→a+ f(x) = L pro-
vided limx→aS f(x) = L for some open interval S = (a, b).
limx→a+ f(x) is the right-hand limit of f at a. Again f need
not be deﬁned at a.
(c) For a ∈R and a function f we write limx→a−f(x) = L pro-
vided limx→aS f(x) = L for some open interval S = (c, a).
limx→a−f(x) is the left-hand limit of fat a.
(d) For a function f
we write limx→∞f(x)
=
L provided
limx→∞S f(x) = L for some interval S = (c, ∞). Likewise,
we write limx→−∞f(x) = L provided limx→−∞S f(x) = L for
some interval S = (−∞, b).
The limits deﬁned above are unique; i.e., they do not depend on
the exact choice of the set S [Exercise 20.19].
Example 1
We have limx→4 x3 = 64 and limx→2 1
x = 1
2 because the functions x3
and 1
x are continuous at 4 and 2, respectively. It is easy to show
limx→0+ 1
x = +∞and limx→0−1
x = −∞; see Exercise 20.14. It
follows that limx→0 1
x does not exist; see Theorem 20.10.
Example 2
Consider limx→2 x2−4
x−2 . This is not like Example 1, because the func-
tion under the limit is not even deﬁned at x = 2. However, we can

§20. Limits of Functions 155
rewrite the function as
x2 −4
x −2 = (x −2)(x + 2)
x −2
= x + 2
for
x ̸= 2.
Now it is clear that limx→2 x2−4
x−2 = limx→2(x + 2) = 4. We should
emphasize that the functions x2−4
x−2 and x + 2 are not identical. The
domain of f(x) =
x2−4
x−2 is (−∞, 2) ∪(2, ∞) while the domain of
˜f(x) = x + 2 is R, so that ˜f is an extension of f. This seems like
nitpicking and this example may appear silly, but the function f,
not ˜f, arises naturally in computing the derivative of g(x) = x2 at
x = 2. Indeed, using the deﬁnition of derivative we have
g′(2) = lim
x→2
g(x) −g(2)
x −2
= lim
x→2
x2 −4
x −2 ,
so our modest computation above shows g′(2) = 4. Of course, this
is obvious from the formula g′(x) = 2x, but we are preparing the
foundations of limits and derivatives, so we are beginning with simple
examples.
Example 3
Consider limx→1
√x−1
x−1 . We employ a trick that should be familiar by
now; we multiply the numerator and denominator by √x + 1 and
obtain
√x −1
x −1
= (√x −1)(√x + 1)
(x −1)(√x + 1) =
x −1
(x −1)(√x + 1) =
1
√x + 1
for x ̸= 1. Hence limx→1
√x−1
x−1
= limx→1
1
√x+1 = 1
2. We have just
laboriously veriﬁed that if h(x) = √x, then h′(1) = 1
2.
Example 4
Let f(x) =
1
(x−2)3 for x ̸= 2. Then limx→∞f(x) = limx→−∞f(x) =
0, limx→2+ f(x) = +∞and limx→2−f(x) = −∞.
To verify limx→∞f(x) = 0, we consider a sequence (xn) such
that limn→∞xn = +∞and show limn→∞f(xn) = 0. This will show
limx→∞S f(x) = 0 for S = (2, ∞), for example. Exercise 9.11 and
Theorem 9.9 show limn→∞(xn −2)3 = +∞, and then Theorem 9.10

shows
lim
n→∞f(xn) = lim
n→∞(xn −2)−3 = 0.
(1)
Here is a direct proof of (1). Let ϵ > 0. For large n, we need |xn −
2|−3 < ϵ or ϵ−1 < |xn −2|3 or ϵ−1/3 < |xn −2|. The last inequality
holds if xn > ϵ−1/3 + 2. Since limn→∞xn = +∞, there exists N so
that
n > N
implies
xn > ϵ−1/3 + 2.
Reversing the algebraic steps above, we ﬁnd
n > N
implies
|xn −2|−3 < ϵ.
This establishes (1).
Similar arguments prove limx→−∞f(x) = 0 and limx→2+ f(x) =
+∞. To prove limx→2−f(x) = −∞, consider a sequence (xn) such
that xn < 2 for all n and limn→∞xn = 2. Then 2 −xn > 0 for
all n and limn→∞(2 −xn) = 0. Hence limn→∞(2 −xn)3 = 0 by
Theorem 9.4, and 9.10 implies limn→∞(2 −xn)−3 = +∞. It follows
[Exercise 9.10(b)] that
lim
n→∞f(xn) = lim
n→∞(xn −2)−3 = −∞.
(2)
This proves that limx→2S f(x) = −∞for S = (−∞, 2), so that
limx→2−f(x) = −∞. Of course, a direct proof of (2) also can be
given.
The limits discussed above are conﬁrmed in Fig. 20.1.
We will discuss the various limits deﬁned in Deﬁnition 20.3 fur-
ther at the end of this section. First we prove some limit theorems
in considerable generality.
20.4 Theorem.
Let f1 and f2 be functions for which the limits L1 = limx→aS f1(x)
and L2 = limx→aS f2(x) exist and are ﬁnite. Then
(i) limx→aS(f1 + f2)(x) exists and equals L1 + L2;
(ii) limx→aS(f1f2)(x) exists and equals L1L2;
(iii) limx→aS(f1/f2)(x) exists and equals L1/L2 provided L2 ̸= 0
and f2(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈S.

§20. Limits of Functions 157
FIGURE 20.1
Proof
The hypotheses imply both f1 and f2 are deﬁned on S and a is the
limit of some sequence in S. Clearly the functions f1 + f2 and f1f2
are deﬁned on S and so is f1/f2 if f2(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈S.
Consider a sequence (xn) in S with limit a. By hypotheses we
have L1 = limn→∞f1(xn) and L2 = limn→∞f2(xn). Theorems 9.3
and 9.4 now show
lim
n→∞(f1 + f2)(xn) = lim
n→∞f1(xn) + lim
n→∞f2(xn) = L1 + L2
and
lim
n→∞(f1f2)(xn) =

lim
n→∞f1(xn)

·

lim
n→∞f2(xn)

= L1L2.
Thus (2) in Deﬁnition 20.1 holds for f1 +f2 and f1f2, so that (i) and
(ii) hold. Likewise (iii) follows by an application of Theorem 9.6.
Some of the inﬁnite variations of Theorem 20.4 appear in Exer-
cise 20.20. The next theorem is less general than might have been
expected; Example 7 shows why.

3. Continuity
158
20.5 Theorem.
Let f be a function for which the limit L = limx→aS f(x) exists and
is ﬁnite. If g is a function deﬁned on {f(x) : x ∈S} ∪{L} that is
continuous at L, then limx→aS g ◦f(x) exists and equals g(L).
Proof
Note g ◦f is deﬁned on S by our assumptions. Consider a sequence
(xn) in S with limit a. Then we have L = limn→∞f(xn). Since g is
continuous at L, it follows that
g(L) = lim
n→∞g(f(xn)) = lim
n→∞g ◦f(xn).
Hence limx→aS g ◦f(x) = g(L).
Example 5
If f is a function for which the limit L = limx→a f(x) exists and is
ﬁnite, then we have limx→a |f(x)| = |L|. This follows immediately
from Theorem 20.5 with g(x) = |x|. Similarly, we have limx→a ef(x) =
eL if we accept the fact that g(x) = ex is continuous on R.
Example 6
If f is a function for which limx→0+ f(x) = 0 and limx→∞f(x) =
π
2, then we have limx→0+ ef(x) = e0 = 1, limx→∞ef(x) = e
π
2 ,
limx→0+ sin(f(x)) = sin(0) = 0 and limx→∞sin(f(x)) = sin π
2 = 1.
Example 7
We give an example to show continuity of g is needed in Theo-
rem 20.5. Explicitly, we give examples of functions f and g such
that limx→0 f(x) = 1, limx→1 g(x) = 4 and yet limx→0 g ◦f(x) does
not exist. One would expect this limit to exist and to equal 4, but in
the example f(x) will equal 1 for arbitrarily small x while g(1) ̸= 4.
The functions f and g are deﬁned by f(x) = 1 + x sin π
x for x ̸= 0,
g(x) = 4 for x ̸= 1, and g(1) = −4. Clearly limx→0 f(x) = 1 and
limx→1 g(x) = 4. Let xn = 2
n for n ∈N. Then f(xn) = 1 + 2
n sin(nπ
2 );
hence f(xn) = 1 for even n and f(xn) ̸= 1 for odd n. Therefore
g ◦f(xn) = −4 for even n and g ◦f(xn) = 4 for odd n. Since
limn→∞xn = 0, we conclude limx→0 g ◦f(x) does not exist.

§20. Limits of Functions 159
As in Theorem 17.2, the limits deﬁned in Deﬁnitions 20.1 and 20.3
can be recast to avoid sequences. First we state and prove a typi-
cal result of this sort. Then, after Corollary 20.8, we give a general
scheme without proof.
20.6 Theorem.
Let f be a function deﬁned on a subset S of R, let a be a real number
that is the limit of some sequence in S, and let L be a real number.
then limx→aS f(x) = L if and only if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
x ∈S and |x −a| < δ imply |f(x) −L| < ϵ.
(1)
Proof
We imitate our proof of Theorem 17.2. Suppose (1) holds, and con-
sider a sequence (xn) in S such that limn→∞xn = a. To show
limn→∞f(xn) = L, consider ϵ > 0. By (1) there exists δ > 0 such
that
x ∈S
and
|x −a| < δ
imply
|f(x) −L| < ϵ.
Since limn→∞xn = a, there exists a number N such that n > N
implies |xn −a| < δ. Since xn ∈S for all n, we conclude
n > N
implies
|f(xn) −L| < ϵ.
Thus limn→∞f(xn) = L.
Now assume limx→aS f(x) = L, but (1) fails. Then for some ϵ > 0
the implication
“x ∈S
and
|x −a| < δ
imply
|f(x) −L| < ϵ”
fails for each δ > 0. Then for each n ∈N there exists xn in S
where |xn −a| < 1
n while |f(xn) −L| ≥ϵ. Hence (xn) is a sequence
in S with limit a for which limn→∞f(xn) = L fails. Consequently
limx→aS f(x) = L fails to hold.
20.7 Corollary.
Let f be a function deﬁned on J \ {a} for some open interval J
containing a, and let L be a real number. Then limx→a f(x) = L if

160
and only if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < |x −a| < δ implies |f(x) −L| < ϵ.
(1)
20.8 Corollary.
Let f be a function deﬁned on some interval (a, b), and let L be a
real number. Then limx→a+ f(x) = L if and only if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < x < a + δ implies |f(x) −L| < ϵ.
(1)
20.9 Discussion.
We now consider limx→s f(x) = L where L can be ﬁnite, +∞or
−∞, and s is a symbol a, a+, a−, ∞or −∞[here a ∈R]. Note
we have 15 [= 3 · 5] diﬀerent sorts of limits here. It turns out that
limx→s f(x) = L if and only if
for each
there exists
such that
implies
.
(1)
For ﬁnite limits L, the ﬁrst and last blanks are ﬁlled in by “ϵ > 0”
and “|f(x)−L| < ϵ.” For L = +∞, the ﬁrst and last blanks are ﬁlled
in by “M > 0” and “f(x) > M,” while for L = −∞they are ﬁlled
in by “M < 0” and “f(x) < M.” When we consider limx→a f(x),
then f is deﬁned on J \ {a} for some open interval J containing
a, and the second and third blanks are ﬁlled in by “δ > 0” and
“0 < |x −a| < δ.” For limx→a+ f(x) we require f to be deﬁned on
an interval (a, b) and the second and third blanks are ﬁlled in by
“δ > 0” and “a < x < a + δ.” For limx→a−f(x) we require f to
be deﬁned on an interval (c, a) and the second and third blanks are
ﬁlled in by “δ > 0” and “a−δ < x < a.” For limx→∞f(x) we require
f to be deﬁned on an interval (c, ∞) and the second and third blanks
are ﬁlled in by “α < ∞and “α < x.” A similar remark applies to
limx→−∞f(x).
The assertions above with L ﬁnite and s equal to a or a+ are
contained in Corollaries 20.7 and 20.8.
20.10 Theorem.
Let f be a function deﬁned on J \ {a} for some open interval
J containing a. Then limx→a f(x) exists if and only if the limits

§20. Limits of Functions 161
limx→a+ f(x) and limx→a−f(x) both exist and are equal, in which
case all three limits are equal.
Proof
Suppose limx→a f(x) = L and L is ﬁnite. Then (1) in Corol-
lary 20.7 holds, so (1) in Corollary 20.8 obviously holds. Thus we
have limx→a+ f(x) = L; similarly limx→a−f(x) = L.
Now suppose limx→a+ f(x) = limx→a−f(x) = L where L is ﬁnite.
Consider ϵ > 0; we apply Corollary 20.8 and its analogue for a−to
obtain δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that
a < x < a + δ1
implies
|f(x) −L| < ϵ
and
a −δ2 < x < a
implies
|f(x) −L| < ϵ.
If δ = min{δ1, δ2}, then
0 < |x −a| < δ
implies
|f(x) −L| < ϵ,
so limx→a f(x) = L by Corollary 20.7.
Similar arguments apply if the limits L are inﬁnite. For example,
suppose limx→a f(x) = +∞and consider M > 0. There exists δ > 0
such that
0 < |x −a| < δ
implies
f(x) > M.
(1)
Then clearly
a < x < a + δ
implies
f(x) > M
(2)
and
a −δ < x < a
implies
f(x) > M,
(3)
so that limx→a+ f(x) = limx→a−f(x) = +∞.
As a last example, suppose limx→a+ f(x) = limx→a−f(x) = +∞.
For each M > 0 there exists δ1 > 0 so that (2) holds, and there
exists δ2 > 0 so that (3) holds. Then (1) holds with δ = min{δ1, δ2}.
We conclude limx→a f(x) = +∞.

3. Continuity
162
20.11 Remark.
Note limx→−∞f(x) is very similar to the right-hand limits limx→a+
f(x). For example, if L is ﬁnite, then limx→a+ f(x) = L if and only
if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists α > a such that
a < x < α implies |f(x) −L| < ϵ,
(1)
since α > a if and only if α = a + δ for some δ > 0; see Corol-
lary 20.8. If we set a = −∞in (1), we obtain the condition (1) in
Discussion 20.9 equivalent to limx→−∞f(x) = L.
In the same way, the limits limx→∞f(x) and limx→a−f(x) will
equal L [L ﬁnite] if and only if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists α < a such that
α < x < a implies |f(x) −L| < ϵ.
(2)
Obvious changes are needed if L is inﬁnite.

§21
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity
In this section and the next section we continue the introduction to
metric space ideas initiated in §13. More thorough treatments appear
in [33,53] and [62]. In particular, for this brief introduction we avoid
the technical and somewhat confusing matter of relative topolo-
gies that is not, and should not be, avoided in the more thorough
treatments.
We are interested in functions between metric spaces (S, d) and
(S∗, d∗). We will write “f: S →S∗” to signify dom(f) = S and f
takes values in S∗, i.e., f(x) ∈S∗for all s ∈S.
21.1 Deﬁnition.
Consider metric spaces (S, d) and (S∗, d∗). A function f: S →S∗is
continuous at s0 in S if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
d(s, s0) < δ implies d∗(f(s), f(s0)) < ϵ.
(1)
We say f is continuous on a subset E of S if f is continuous at each
point of E. The function f is uniformly continuous on a subset E of
S if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
s, t ∈E and d(s, t) < δ imply d∗(f(s), f(t)) < ϵ.
(2)
Example 1
Let S = S∗= R and d = d∗= dist where, as usual, dist(a, b) = |a−b|.
The deﬁnition of continuity given above is equivalent to that in §17
in view of Theorem 17.2. The deﬁnition of uniform continuity is
equivalent to that in Deﬁnition 19.1.

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 165
Example 2
In several variable calculus, real-valued functions with domain R2 or
R3, or even Rk, are extensively studied. This corresponds to the case
S = Rk,
d(x, y) =
⎡
⎣
k

j=1
(xj −yj)2
⎤
⎦
1/2
,
S∗= R and d∗= dist. We will not develop the theory, but gener-
ally speaking, functions that look continuous will be. Some examples
on R2 are f(x1, x2) = x2
1 + x2
2, f(x1, x2) = x1x2

x2
1 + x2
2 + 1,
f(x1, x2) = cos(x1 −x5
2). Some examples on R3 are g(x1, x2, x3) =
x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3, g(x1, x2, x3) = x1x2 + x1x3 + x2x3,
g(x1, x2, x3) =
ex1+x2 log(x2
3 + 2).
Example 3
Functions with domain R and values in R2 or R3, or generally Rk,
are also studied in several variable calculus. This corresponds to the
case S = R, d = dist, S∗= Rk and
d∗(x, y) =
⎡
⎣
k

j=1
(xj −yj)2
⎤
⎦
1/2
.
The images of such functions are what nonmathematicians often call
a “curve” or “path.” In order to distinguish a function from its image,
we will adhere to the following terminology. Suppose γ: R →Rk is
continuous. Then we will call γ a path; its image γ(R) in Rk will be
called a curve. We will also use this terminology if γ is deﬁned and
continuous on some subinterval of R, such as [a, b]; see Exercise 21.7.
As an example, consider γ where γ(t) = (cos t, sin t). This func-
tion maps R onto the circle in R2 about (0, 0) with radius 1.
More generally γ0(t) = (a cos t, b sin t) maps R onto the ellipse with
equation x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1; see Fig. 21.1.
The graph of an ordinary continuous function f: R →R looks
like a curve, and it is! It is the curve for the path γ(t) = (t, f(t)).

3. Continuity
166
FIGURE 21.1
FIGURE 21.2
Curves in R3 can be quite exotic. For example, the curve for the
path h(t) = (cos t, sin t, t
4) is a helix. See Fig. 21.2.
We did not prove that any of the paths above are continuous,
because we can easily prove the following general fact.

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 167
21.2 Proposition.
Consider a function γ : [a, b] →Rk and write
γ(t) = (f1(t), f2(t), . . . , fk(t))
for
t ∈[a, b];
thus f1, f2, . . . , fk are real-valued functions on [a, b]. Then γ is
continuous, i.e., a path, if and only if each fj is continuous.
Proof
Both implications follow from formula (1) in the proof of Lemma 13.3
and Exercise 13.2:
|xj −yj| ≤d∗(x, y) ≤
√
k max{|xj −yj| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k}.
(1)
For t, t0 in [a, b], (1) implies
|fj(t) −fj(t0)| ≤d∗(γ(t), γ(t0))
for
j = 1, . . . , k,
(2)
and d∗(γ(t), γ(t0)) ≤
√
k max{|fj(t) −fj(t0)| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k}. (3)
Suppose γ is continuous on [a, b], and consider some j in
{1, 2, . . . , k}. To show fj is continuous at t0 in [a, b], given ϵ > 0,
select δ > 0 so that d∗(γ(t), γ(t0)) < ϵ for |t −t0| < δ. Then by (2),
|t −t0| < δ implies |fj(t) −fj(t0)| < ϵ. So fj is continuous on [a, b].
Now suppose that each fj is continuous on [a, b], and consider
ϵ > 0. For each j, there is δj > 0 such that
|t −t0| < δj
implies
|fj(t) −fj(t0)| <
ϵ
√
k
.
For δ = min{δ1, δ2, . . . , δk} and |t −t0| < δ, we have
max{|fj(t) −fj(t0)| : j = 1, 2, . . . , k} <
ϵ
√
k
,
so by (3) we have d∗(γ(t), γ(t0)) < ϵ. Thus γ is continuous at t0.
The next theorem shows continuity is a topological property; see
Discussion 13.7.
21.3 Theorem.
Consider metric spaces (S, d) and (S∗, d∗). A function f: S →S∗is
continuous on S if and only if
f −1(U) is an open subset of S
for every open subset U of S∗.
(1)

3. Continuity
168
Recall f −1(U) = {s ∈S : f(s) ∈U}.
Proof
Suppose f is continuous on S. Let U be an open subset of S∗, and
consider s0 ∈f −1(U). We need to show s0 is interior to f −1(U).
Since f(s0) ∈U and U is open, we have
{s∗∈S∗: d∗(s∗, f(s0)) < ϵ} ⊆U
(2)
for some ϵ > 0. Since f is continuous at s0, there exists δ > 0 such
that
d(s, s0) < δ
implies
d∗(f(s), f(s0)) < ϵ.
(3)
From (2) and (3) we conclude d(s, s0) < δ implies f(s) is in U; hence
s ∈f −1(U). That is,
{s ∈S : d(s, s0) < δ} ⊆f −1(U),
so that s0 is interior to f −1(U).
Conversely, suppose (1) holds, and consider s0 ∈S and ϵ > 0.
Then U = {s∗∈S∗: d∗(s∗, f(s0)) < ϵ} is open in S∗, so f −1(U) is
open in S. Since s0 ∈f −1(U), for some δ > 0 we have
{s ∈S : d(s, s0) < δ} ⊆f −1(U).
It follows that
d(s, s0) < δ
implies
d∗(f(s), f(s0)) < ϵ.
Thus f is continuous at s0.
Continuity at a point is also a topological property; see Exer-
cise 21.2. Uniform continuity is a topological property, too, but if
we made this precise we would be led to a special class of topologies
given by so-called “uniformities.”

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 169
We will show continuous functions preserve two important topo-
logical properties: compactness, and connectedness which will be
deﬁned in the next section. The next theorem and corollary illustrate
the power of compactness.
21.4 Theorem.
Consider metric spaces (S, d), (S∗, d∗) and a continuous function
f: S →S∗. Let E be a compact subset of S. Then
(i) f(E) is a compact subset of S∗, and
(ii) f is uniformly continuous on E.
Proof
To prove (i), let U be an open cover of f(E). For each U ∈U, f −1(U)
is open in S. Moreover, {f −1(U) : U ∈U} is a cover of E. Hence
there exist U1, U2, . . . , Um in U such that
E ⊆f −1(U1) ∪f −1(U2) ∪· · · ∪f −1(Um).
Then
f(E) ⊆U1 ∪U2 ∪· · · ∪Um,
so {U1, U2, . . . , Um} is the desired ﬁnite subcover of U for f(E). This
proves (i).
To establish (ii), let ϵ > 0. For each s ∈E there exists δs > 0
[this δ depends on s] such that
d(s, t) < δs
implies
d∗(f(s), f(t)) < ϵ
2.
(1)
For each s ∈E, let Vs = {t ∈S : d(s, t) < 1
2δs}. Then the family
V = {Vs : s ∈E} is an open cover of E. By compactness, there exist
ﬁnitely many points s1, s2, . . . , sn in E such that
E ⊆Vs1 ∪Vs2 ∪· · · ∪Vsn.
Let δ = 1
2 min{δs1, δs2, . . . , δsn}. We complete the proof by showing
s, t ∈E
and
d(s, t) < δ
imply
d∗(f(s), f(t)) < ϵ.
(2)
For some k in {1, 2, . . . , n} we have s ∈Vsk, i.e., d(s, sk) < 1
2δsk. Also
we have
d(t, sk) ≤d(t, s) + d(s, sk) < δ + 1
2δsk ≤δsk.

3. Continuity
170
Therefore applying (1) twice we have
d∗(f(s), f(sk)) < ϵ
2
and
d∗(f(t), f(sk)) < ϵ
2.
Hence d∗(f(s), f(t)) < ϵ as desired.
Assertion (ii) in Theorem 21.4 generalizes Theorem 19.2. The
next corollary should be compared with Theorem 18.1.
21.5 Corollary.
Let f be a continuous real-valued function on a metric space (S, d).
If E is a compact subset of S, then
(i) f is bounded on E,
(ii) f assumes its maximum and minimum on E.
Proof
Since f(E) is compact in R, the set f(E) is bounded by Theo-
rem 13.12. This implies (i).
Since f(E) is compact, it contains sup f(E) by Exercise 13.13.
Thus there exists s0 ∈E so that f(s0) = sup f(E). This tells us
f assumes its maximum value on E at the point s0. Similarly, f
assumes its minimum on E.
Example 4
All the functions f in Example 2 are bounded on any compact subset
of R2, i.e., on any closed and bounded set in R2. Likewise, all the
functions g in Example 2 are bounded on each closed and bounded
set in R3.
Example 5
Let γ be any path in Rk; see Example 3. For −∞< a < b < ∞,
the image γ([a, b]) is closed and bounded in Rk by Theorem 21.4.
Note Corollary 21.5 does not apply in this case, since the set S∗in
Theorem 21.4 is Rk, not R. Theorem 21.4 also tells us γ is uniformly
continuous on [a, b]. Thus if ϵ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
s, t ∈[a, b]
and
|s −t| < δ
imply
d(γ(s), γ(t)) < ϵ.
This fact is useful in several variable calculus, where one integrates
along paths γ; compare Discussion 19.3.

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 171
Example 6
Consider a function f : E →R, where E be a compact subset of R.
We will show f is continuous if and only if its graph G = {(t, f(t)) :
t ∈E} is a compact subset of R2. Suppose ﬁrst that f is continuous.
The proof of Proposition 21.2 shows γ(s) = (s, f(s)) is a continuous
function on E, so its image γ(E) = G is compact by Theorem 21.4(i).
Now assume G is compact, but f is not continuous at t0 in E.
Then there exists an ϵ > 0 and a sequence (tn) in E such that
lim
n tn = t0
and
|f(tn) −f(t0)| ≥ϵ
for all
n.
(1)
Since G is a bounded set, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 13.5
shows (tn, f(tn)) has a convergent subsequence (tnk, f(tnk)). Its limit
is in G, because G is closed in R2 by the Heine-Borel Theorem 13.12.
Thus there exists t in E so that limk(tnk, f(tnk)) = (t, f(t)). Since
limn tn = t0, we have t = t0, and therefore limk(tnk, f(tnk)) =
(t0, f(t0)). In particular, limk f(tnk) = f(t0), which contradicts the
inequality in (1).
Mark Lynch [44] uses the fact above to give a very interesting
construction of a continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable function on a
closed interval [0, 1]; see his construction on page 361.
21.6 Remark.
The remainder of this section will be devoted to the Baire Cate-
gory Theorem and some interesting consequences. We will need some
metric-space terminology, some of it from §13. Let (S, d) be a metric
space. For a subset E of S, its complement is S\E = {s ∈S : s /∈E}.
A point s is in the interior of a set E, or interior to E, if s ∈V ⊆E
for some open subset V of S. A subset E of S is closed if S \ E is
open. A point s is in the closure of a set E if every open set con-
taining s also contains an element of E. We write E−for the set of
points in the closure of E.
A subset D of S is dense in S if every nonempty open set U
intersects D, i.e., D∩U ̸= ∅. For example, Q is dense in R, since every
nonempty open interval in R contains rationals; see 4.7 on page 25.
Finally, a totally new deﬁnition: a subset E of S is nowhere dense in
S if its closure E−has empty interior. Obviously E is nowhere dense
if and only if E−is nowhere dense. Also, E is nowhere dense in S if
and only if S \ E−is dense in S.

3. Continuity
172
Each part of the next theorem is a variant of what is called the
Baire Category Theorem. After that theorem, we will give the ulti-
mate version of this theorem and explain the terminology “category.”
Just as in Example 4 on page 88, open balls Br(x0) = {x ∈S :
d(x, x0) < r} in S are open sets, and closed balls Cr(x0) = {x ∈S :
d(x, x0) ≤r} are closed sets. Note Cs(x0) ⊆Br(x0) for s < r.
21.7 Theorem.
Let (S, d) be a complete metric space. Then
(a) If (Un) is a sequence of dense open subsets of S, then the
intersection X = ∩∞
n=1Un is dense in S.
(b) If (Fn) is a sequence of closed subsets of S and if the union
F = ∪∞
n=1Fn contains a nonempty open set, then so does at
least one of the sets Fn.
(c) The union of a sequence of nowhere dense subsets of S has dense
complement.
(d) The space S is not a union of a sequence of nowhere dense
subsets of S.
Proof
All the hard work will be in proving: Part (a). Consider a nonempty
open subset V of S; we need to show X ∩V ̸= ∅. Since U1 is open
and dense and V is open, U1 ∩V is open and nonempty. So there
exists x1 ∈U1 ∩V and r1 ≤1 so that Cr1(x1) ⊆U1 ∩V . Since U2 is
open and dense and Br1(x1) is open, there exists x2 ∈Br1(x1) ∩U2
and r2 ≤1
2 so that Cr2(x2) ⊆Br1(x1) ∩U2. Continuing, we obtain
sequences (xk) in S and positive numbers (rk) so that
xk+1 ∈Brk(xk),
rk ≤
1
2k−1
and
Crk+1(xk+1) ⊆Brk(xk) ∩Uk+1.
Note d(xk, xk+1) < rk for all k, so for m < n we have
d(xm, xn) ≤
n−1

k=m
d(xk, xk+1) <
n−1

k=m
1
2k−1 <
∞

k=m
1
2k−1 =
1
2m−2.
Thus the sequence (xk) is a Cauchy sequence in S. Since S is
complete, we have limk xk = x for some x ∈S. Since we have
xk ∈Crk(xk) ⊆Crn(xn)
for
k ≥n,

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 173
and since Crn(xn) is closed, x also belongs to Crn. This is true for
all n, so
x ∈
∞

n=1
Crn(xn) ⊆
∞

n=1
Un = X.
Since we also have x ∈Cr1(x1) ⊂V , we conclude x ∈X ∩V , as
desired.
Part (b). Suppose ∪∞
n=1Fn has nonempty interior. Then S \
∪∞
n=1Fn = ∩∞
n=1(S \ Fn) is not dense in S. Since the sets S \ Fn
are open, part (a) shows that at least one of them, say S \ Fm, is
also not dense in S. Thus its complement Fm contains a nonempty
open set.
Part (c). Let A = ∪∞
n=1An be the union of a sequence of nowhere
dense sets An. We need to show the complement of A, S \ A, is
dense in S. If we replace each An by its closure, they will still be
nowhere dense and S \ A only gets smaller. In other words, we may
assume each An is closed and nowhere dense. Part (b) implies that
A contains no nonempty open set. Thus every nonempty open set
intersects S \ A, and S \ A is dense in S.
Part (d). This is obvious from part (c), since the complement of
S is the empty set ∅.
Theorem 21.7 tells us in diﬀerent ways that the union of a se-
quence of nowhere dense subsets of a complete metric space is small
relative to the size of S. For this reason, it is common to divide the
subsets of S into two categories. Category 1 consists of sets that are
unions of sequences of nowhere dense subsets of S, and Category 2
consists of the other subsets of S. Here is part (d) of Theorem 21.7
restated using this language.
21.8 Baire Category Theorem.
A complete metric space (S, d) is of the second category in itself.
The expression “in itself” here deserves a comment. Many topo-
logical properties about sets E ⊆S depend on the set S. For
example, the set (0, 1] is not closed in S = R, but it is closed in

3. Continuity
174
S = (0, ∞) viewed as a metric space. Category is another prop-
erty that depends on S, so “in itself” in Theorem 21.8 stresses the
reference to the complete metric space S.1
21.9 Corollary.
Each of the spaces Rk is of second category in itself.
Example 7
Any set that can be listed as a sequence is said to be “countable.”
Other sets are “uncountable.”
(a) Countable unions of sets of ﬁrst category are sets of ﬁrst cate-
gory. For example, countable subsets of R, and more generally
of Rk, are of ﬁrst category, since single points {x} in these
spaces are nowhere dense. This and Corollary 21.9 give another
(rather heavy-handed) proof that R is uncountable; compare
Exercise 16.8.
(b) Example 3 on page 70 shows the set Q of rationals is countable.
Thus Q is of ﬁrst category in R, and the set of irrationals is of
second category in R.
(c) Each straight line in the plane R2 is of ﬁrst category in R2, so
a countable union of straight lines is of ﬁrst category in R2.
21.10 Discussion.
A closed set E in a metric space is said to be perfect if every point
x in E is the limit of a sequence of points in E \ {x}; compare
Proposition 13.9(b). This proposition also shows closed subsets of
complete metric spaces are themselves complete metric spaces. In
a perfect subset E of a complete metric space, single points are
nowhere dense in E, so countable subsets of E are of ﬁrst cate-
gory. Therefore, nonempty perfect subsets of complete metric spaces
are uncountable. The Cantor set (in Example 5 on page 89) is an
interesting compact perfect set.
Recall Exercise 17.14, where a function on R is described that is
continuous at each irrational and discontinuous at each rational. In
1One of the ﬁne properties of compactness is: If a set is compact in some set,
then it is compact in all sets.

§21.
* More on Metric Spaces: Continuity 175
the next example, we will show there are no functions on R that are
continuous at only the rationals.
Example 8
(a) Consider any function f on R. For each x in R, let
ωf(x) = inf
δ>0 sup{|f(y) −f(z)| : y, z ∈(x −δ, x + δ)}.
The function ωf is the “oscillation function” of f. The function
f is continuous at x if and only if ωf(x) = 0; see Exercise 21.13.
We show each set {x ∈R : ωf(x) < ϵ} is open in R; ϵ > 0.
Suppose ωf(x0) < ϵ; we need to show this inequality holds in
an interval containing x0. By the deﬁnition, there exists δ > 0
such that
sup{|f(y) −f(z)| : y, z ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ)} < ϵ.
For x ∈(x0 −δ
2, x0 + δ
2) we have (x−δ
2, x+ δ
2) ⊆(x0 −δ, x0 +δ),
and therefore
ωf(x) ≤sup

|f(y) −f(z)| : y, z ∈

x −δ
2, x + δ
2

≤sup{|f(y) −f(z)| : y, z ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ)} < ϵ.
(b) There is no function f on R that is continuous only on the set
Q of rational numbers. Otherwise, by part (a) the equality
Q = {x ∈R : ωf(x) = 0} =
∞

n=1

x ∈R : ωf(x) < 1


would express Q as the intersection of a sequence of open
subsets of R, contrary to Exercise 21.11.
21.11 Theorem.
No nondegenerate interval I in R can be written as the disjoint
union of two or more nondegenerate closed intervals. (An interval
is “nondegenerate” if it has more than one point.)
Proof
We prove the theorem for I = [a, b], a < b, and leave the other cases
to Exercise 21.14. Assume I is the disjoint union of two or more
nondegenerate closed intervals. It is clear there are inﬁnitely many

3. Continuity
176
such intervals, because otherwise they could be listed in order, and
there would be points in I between the ﬁrst and second interval.
It is also clear that the family can be listed as a sequence (i.e., is
countable), since there is a one-to-one function from the collection
of disjoint intervals into Q.
So we assume I = ∪∞
k=1[ak, bk]. By Discussion 13.7(iii) on page 87,
the union ∪∞
k=1(ak, bk) is open, so that K = I \∪∞
k=1(ak, bk) is closed.
Then K is the set of endpoints of the removed intervals, so K is
nonempty and countable. We will show K is perfect, and this will
be a contradiction by Discussion 21.10. Consider x in K; we may
assume x ̸= b. Consider an interval (x, x + h) where h > 0. Some
closed interval [am, bm] must intersect (x, x+h), and [am, bm] cannot
contain x in K. Thus x < am < x + h. Since am is in K, the interval
(x, x + h) intersects K, and since h > 0 is arbitrary, x is a limit of
points in K\{x}. This shows K is perfect, completing the proof.
A close examination of Example 8(b) and Theorem 21.11 shows
they both depend on the Baire Category Theorem 21.8. Other ap-
plications of this theorem appear in Theorem 38.3 and twice in
Theorem 38.5.

§22
* More on Metric Spaces:
Connectedness
Consider a subset E of R that is not an interval. As noted in the
proof of Corollary 18.3, the property
y1, y2 ∈E
and
y1 < y < y2
imply
y ∈E
must fail. So there exist y1, y2, y in R such that
y1 < y < y2,
y1, y2 ∈E,
y /∈E.
(*)
The set E is not “connected” because y separates E into two pieces.
Put another way, if we set U1 = (−∞, y) and U2 = (y, ∞), then we
obtain open sets so that E∩U1 and E∩U2 are disjoint nonempty sets
who union is E. The last observation can be promoted to a useful
general deﬁnition.
22.1 Deﬁnition.
Let E be a subset of a metric space (S, d). The set E is disconnected
if one of the following two equivalent conditions holds.
(a)2 There are open subsets U1 and U2 of S such that
(E ∩U1) ∩(E ∩U2) = ∅
and
E = (E ∩U1) ∪(E ∩U2),
(1)
E ∩U1 ̸= ∅
and
E ∩U2 ̸= ∅.
(2)
2Readers familiar with relative topologies will recognize this as stating that E is
a disjoint union of nonempty relatively-open subsets of E.

§22. * More on Metric Spaces: Connectedness 179
(b) There are disjoint nonempty subsets A and B of E such that
E = A ∪B and neither set intersects the closure of the other
set, i.e.,
A−∩B = ∅
and
A ∩B−= ∅.
(3)
A set E is connected if it is not disconnected.
Remark. We show that conditions (a) and (b) above are
equivalent.
If (a) holds, set A = E ∩U1 and B = E ∩U2. To check (b), we
need only verify (3). If, for example, A−∩B ̸= ∅, then there exists
b ∈A−∩B ⊆U2, so there is r > 0 so that {s ∈S : d(s, b) < r} ⊆U2.
Since b is in A−, Proposition 13.9(c) shows there is a in A such that
d(a, b) < r. But then a ∈U2 ∩E = B, a contradiction, since A and
B are disjoint. Thus (3) holds, and condition (b) holds.
Now suppose that (b) holds. Let U1 = S \ B−and U2 = S \ A−.
To verify (a), it suﬃces to show E ∩U1 = A and E ∩U2 = B.
For example, x ∈E ∩U1 implies x ∈S \ B implies x /∈B. Since
x ∈A ∪B, we conclude x ∈A. Finally, if x ∈A, then x /∈B−
by (3), so x ∈S \ B−= U1. Therefore x is in E ∩U1. We’ve shown
E ∩U1 = A.
Example 1
As noted before the deﬁnition, sets in R that are not intervals are
disconnected. Conversely, intervals in R are connected. To prove this
from the deﬁnition, we will assume the contrary and obtain a con-
tradiction. So we assume there is an interval I and open sets U1 and
U2 disconnecting I as in Deﬁnition 22.1(a). Select a ∈I ∩U1 and
b ∈I ∩U2. We may suppose a < b. Now the interval [a, b] satisﬁes
the same conditions in Deﬁnition 22.1(a) as I. So we may assume
I = [a, b], a ∈U1 and b ∈U2.
Let t = sup[a, b)∩U1, so that t > a. Since (b−ϵ, b] ⊆U2 for some
ϵ > 0, we also have t < b. If t is in U1, then [t, t + ϵ) ⊆U1 ∩[a, b]
for some ϵ > 0, but then t = sup[a, b) ∩U1 ≥t + ϵ. If t ∈U2, then
(t −ϵ, t] ⊆U2 ∩[a, b], which would imply t = sup[a, b) ∩U1 ≤t −ϵ.
Each possibility leads to a contradiction, so [a, b] and the original
interval I are connected.

22.2 Theorem.
Consider metric spaces (S, d), (S∗, d∗), and let f: S →S∗be con-
tinuous. If E is a connected subset of S, then f(E) is a connected
subset of S∗.
Proof
Assume f(E) is not connected in S∗. Then there exist open sets V1
and V2 in S∗such that
(f(E) ∩V1) ∩(f(E) ∩V2) = ∅,
f(E) = (f(E) ∩V1) ∪(f(E) ∩V2),
f(E) ∩V1 ̸= ∅
and
f(E) ∩V2 ̸= ∅.
Let U1 = f −1(V1) and U2 = f −1(V2). Then U1 and U2 are open
sets in S that separate E as in Deﬁnition 22.1(a). Thus E is not
connected, a contradiction.
The next corollary generalizes Theorem 18.2 and its corollary.
22.3 Corollary.
Let f be a continuous real-valued function on a metric space (S, d).
If E is a connected subset of S, then f(E) is an interval in R. In
particular, f has the intermediate value property.
Example 2
Curves are connected. That is, if γ is a path in Rk as described in
Example 3 of §21, page 165 and I is a subinterval of R, then the
image γ(I) is connected in Rk.
22.4 Deﬁnition.
A subset E of a metric space (S, d) is said to be path-connected if,
for each pair s, t of points in E, there exists a continuous function
γ: [a, b] →E such that γ(a) = s and γ(b) = t. We call γ a path.
22.5 Theorem.
If E in (S, d) is path-connected, then E is connected. [The failure of
the converse is illustrated in Exercise 22.4.]
Proof
Assume E is disconnected by open sets U1 and U2:
(E ∩U1) ∩(E ∩U2) = ∅
and
E = (E ∩U1) ∪(E ∩U2),
(1)
E ∩U1 ̸= ∅
and
E ∩U2 ̸= ∅.

x, y ∈E
and
0 < t < 1
imply
tx + (1 −t)y ∈E,
i.e., whenever E contains two points it contains the line segment
connecting them. See Fig. 22.1. Convex sets E in Rk are always
path-connected. This is because γ(t) = tx + (1 −t)y deﬁnes a path
γ: [0, 1] →E such that γ(0) = y and γ(1) = x. For more details, see
any book on several variable calculus.

and f : I →R is a function with graph G = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈I}.
Then f is continuous if and only if G is path-connected. Note
that “path-connected” here cannot be changed to “connected;” see
Exercise 22.13.
If f is continuous, then for each (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) in G, γ(t) =
(t, f(t)) is a path connecting these points. Note that γ is continuous
by Proposition 21.2.
For the converse, assume G is path-connected. Consider a, b in I
where a < b. Since G is path-connected, there is a continuous func-
tion γ : [0, 1] →G satisfying γ(0) = (a, f(a)) and γ(1) = (b, f(b)). By
Proposition 21.2, we can write γ(t) = (x(t), y(t)) where x and y are
continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]. Of course, y(t) = f(x(t))
for all t. First, we claim
{(z, f(z)) : z ∈[a, b]} ⊆γ([0, 1]).
(1)
Since x(t) is continuous on [0, 1], x(0) = a and x(1) = b, the
Intermediate Value Theorem 18.2 for continuous functions shows
that if z is in (a, b), then x(t) = z for some t ∈(0, 1). Thus
(z, f(z)) = (x(t), f(x(t))) = γ(t). Since the cases z = a and z = b
are trivial, this implies (1).
Next we show f satisﬁes IVP, the intermediate value property:
(IVP) If a, b ∈I, a < b and c is between f(a) and f(b), then
f(x) = c for some x ∈[a, b].
Let α = sup{t ∈[0, 1] : x(t) ≤a} and β = inf{t ∈[0, 1] :
x(t) ≥b}. Thus 0 ≤α < β ≤1. Since x(t) is continuous, we see
that x([α, β]) = [a, b]. Now we apply the Intermediate Value Theo-
rem again, this time to f(x(t)) on [α, β]. Since f(x(α)) = f(a) and

§22. * More on Metric Spaces: Connectedness 183
f(x(β)) = f(b), we have f(x(t)) = c for some t in (α, β). For this t
we have x(t) ∈[a, b], so we have veriﬁed IVP.
Now assume f is not continuous on I. Then there exists x0 ∈I,
ϵ > 0, and a sequence (xn) in I that converges to x0 satisfying
|f(xn) −f(x0)| > ϵ for all n. Then f(xn) > f(x0) + ϵ > f(x0) for
inﬁnitely many n, or else f(xn) < f(x0) −ϵ < f(x0) for inﬁnitely
many n. Passing to a subsequence, we may assume f(xn) > f(x0) +
ϵ > f(x0) for all n, say. By the IVP, for each n there is yn between
xn and x0 so that f(yn) = f(x0) + ϵ. Then (yn, f(yn)) is a sequence
in G satisfying
lim
n yn = x0
and
lim(yn, f(yn)) = (x0, f(x0) + ϵ).
(2)
Moreover, there exist a < b in I such that x0 and all yn belong to
[a, b]. We apply (1) to this a and b and γ described there. So, for each
n ∈N there exists tn ∈[0, 1] so that γ(tn) = (yn, f(yn)). Passing to
a subsequence (tnk)k∈N of (tn), we may assume that limk tnk = t0 for
some t0 in [0, 1]. Since γ is continuous, we conclude from (2) that
γ(t0) = lim
k γ(tnk) = lim
k (ynk, f(ynk)) = (x0, f(x0) + ϵ).
Since this limit is not in G, and γ([0, 1]) ⊂G, we have a contradiction
and f is continuous on I.
We end this section with a discussion of some very diﬀerent metric
spaces. The points in these spaces are actually functions themselves.
22.6 Deﬁnition.
Let S be a subset of R. Let C(S) be the set of all bounded continuous
real-valued functions on S and, for f, g ∈C(S), let
d(f, g) = sup{|f(x) −g(x)| : x ∈S}.
With this deﬁnition, C(S) becomes a metric space [Exercise 22.6].
In this metric space, a sequence (fn) converges to a point [function!]
f provided limn→∞d(fn, f) = 0, that is
lim
n→∞sup{|fn(x) −f(x)| : x ∈S} = 0.
(*)
Put another way, for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈S
and
n > N.

3. Continuity
184
We will study this important concept in the next chapter, but
without using metric space terminology. See Deﬁnition 24.2 and
Remark 24.4 where (*) is called uniform convergence.
A sequence (fn) in C(S) is a Cauchy sequence with respect to
the metric d exactly when it is uniformly Cauchy as deﬁned in Deﬁ-
nition 25.3. In our metric space terminology, Theorems 25.4 and 24.3
tell us that C(S) is a complete metric space.

In this chapter we develop some of the basic properties of power se-
ries. In doing so, we will introduce uniform convergence and illustrate
its importance. In §26 we prove power series can be diﬀerentiated and
integrated term-by-term.
§23
Power Series
Given a sequence (an)∞
n=0 of real numbers, the series ∞
n=0 anxn is
called a power series. Observe the variable x. Thus the power series
is a function of x provided it converges for some or all x. Of course,
it converges for x = 0; note the convention 00 = 1. Whether it
converges for other values of x depends on the choice of coeﬃcients
(an). It turns out that, given any sequence (an), one of the following
holds for its power series:
(a) The power series converges for all x ∈R;
(b) The power series converges only for x = 0;
(c) The power series converges for all x in some bounded interval
centered at 0; the interval may be open, half-open or closed.

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
188
These remarks are consequences of the following important
theorem.
23.1 Theorem.
For the power series  anxn, let
β = lim sup |an|1/n
and
R = 1
β .
[If β = 0 we set R = +∞, and if β = +∞we set R = 0.] Then
(i) The power series converges for |x| < R;
(ii) The power series diverges for |x| > R.
R is called the radius of convergence for the power series. Note
that (i) is a vacuous statement if R = 0 and that (ii) is a vacuous
statement if R = +∞. Note also that (a) above corresponds to the
case R = +∞, (b) above corresponds to the case R = 0, and (c)
above corresponds to the case 0 < R < +∞.
Proof of Theorem 23.1
The proof follows quite easily from the Root Test 14.9. Here are the
details. We want to apply the Root Test to the series  anxn. So for
each x ∈R, let αx be the number or symbol deﬁned in 14.9 for the
series  anxn. Since the nth term of the series is anxn, we have
αx = lim sup |anxn|1/n = lim sup |x||an|1/n = |x| · lim sup |an|1/n = β|x|.
The third equality is justiﬁed by Exercise 12.6(a). Now we consider
cases.
Case 1. Suppose 0 < R < +∞. In this case αx = β|x| = |x|
R .
If |x| < R then αx < 1, so the series converges by the Root Test.
Likewise, if |x| > R, then αx > 1 and the series diverges.
Case 2. Suppose R = +∞. Then β = 0 and αx = 0 no matter
what x is. Hence the power series converges for all x by the Root
Test.
Case 3. Suppose R = 0. Then β = +∞and αx = +∞for x ̸= 0.
Thus by the Root Test the series diverges for x ̸= 0.

§23.
Power Series 189
Recall that if lim |an+1
an | exists, then this limit equals β of the last
theorem by Corollary 12.3. This limit is often easier to calculate than
lim sup |an|1/n; see the examples below.
Example 1
Consider ∞
n=0
1
n!xn. If an = 1
n!, then an+1
an
=
1
n+1, so lim |an+1
an | = 0.
Therefore β = 0, R = +∞and this series has radius of convergence
+∞. That is, it converges for all x in R. In fact, it converges to ex
for all x, but that is another story; see Example 1 in §31, page 252,
and also §37.
Example 2
Consider ∞
n=0 xn. Then β = 1 and R = 1. Note this series does
not converge for x = 1 or x = −1, so the interval of convergence is
exactly (−1, 1). [By interval of convergence we mean the set of x for
which the power series converges.] The series converges to
1
1−x by
formula (2) of Example 1 in §14, page 96.
Example 3
Consider ∞
n=0
1
nxn. Since lim
1
n+1
1
n
= 1, we again have β = 1 and
R = 1. This series diverges for x = 1 [see Example 1 of §15], but
it converges for x = −1 by the Alternating Series theorem 15.3 on
page 108. Hence the interval of convergence is exactly [−1, 1).
Example 4
Consider ∞
n=0
1
n2 xn. Once again β = 1 and R = 1. This series
converges at both x = 1 and x = −1, so its interval of convergence
is exactly [−1, 1].
Example 5
The series ∞
n=0 n!xn has radius of convergence R = 0 because we
have lim |(n+1)!
n!
| = +∞. It diverges for every x ̸= 0.
Examples 1–5 illustrate all the possibilities discussed in (a)–(c)
prior to Theorem 23.1.

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
190
Example 6
Consider ∞
n=0 2−nx3n. This is deceptive, and it is tempting to cal-
culate β = lim sup(2−n)1/n = 1
2 and conclude R = 2. This is wrong
because 2−n is the coeﬃcient of x3n not xn, and the calculation of
β must involve the coeﬃcients an of xn. We need to handle this
series more carefully. The series can be written ∞
n=0 anxn where
a3k = 2−k and an = 0 if n is not a multiple of 3. We calculate β
by using the subsequence of all nonzero terms, i.e., the subsequence
given by σ(k) = 3k. This yields
β = lim sup |an|1/n = lim
k→∞|a3k|1/3k = lim
k→∞(2−k)1/3k = 2−1/3.
Therefore the radius of convergence is R = 1
β = 21/3.
One may consider more general power series of the form
∞

n=0
an(x −x0)n,
(*)
where x0 is a ﬁxed real number, but they reduce to series of the
form ∞
n=0 anyn by the change of variable y = x −x0. The interval
of convergence for the series (*) will be an interval centered at x0.
Example 7
Consider the series

(−1)n+1
n
(x −1)n.
(1)
The radius of convergence for the series ∞
n=1
(−1)n+1
n
yn is R = 1, so
the interval of convergence for the series (1) is the interval (0, 2) plus
perhaps an endpoint or two. Direct substitution shows the series (1)
converges at x = 2 [it’s an alternating series] and diverges to −∞at
x = 0. So the exact interval of convergence is (0, 2]. It turns out that
the series (1) represents the function loge x on (0, 2]. See Examples 1
and 2 in §26.

§23.
Power Series 191
FIGURE 23.1
On of our major goals is to understand the function given by a
power series
f(x) =
∞

k=0
akxk
for
|x| < R.
We are interested in questions like: Is f continuous? Is f diﬀeren-
tiable? If so, can one diﬀerentiate f term-by-term:
f ′(x) =
∞

k=1
kakxk−1 ?
Can one integrate f term-by-term?
Returning to the question of continuity, what reason is there to
believe f is continuous? Its partial sums fn = n
k=0 akxk are contin-
uous, since they are polynomials. Moreover, we have limn→∞fn(x) =
f(x) for |x| < R. Therefore f would be continuous if a result like
the following were true: If (fn) is a sequence of continuous functions
on (a, b) and if limn→∞fn(x) = f(x) for all x ∈(a, b), then f is
continuous on (a, b). However, this ﬁne sounding result is false!
Example 8
Let fn(x) = (1 −|x|)n for x ∈(−1, 1); see Fig. 23.1. Let f(x) = 0
for x ̸= 0 and let f(0) = 1. Then we have limn→∞fn(x) = f(x)
for all x ∈(−1, 1), since limn→∞an = 0 if |a| < 1. Each fn is a
continuous function, but the limit function f is clearly discontinuous
at x = 0.
This example, as well as Exercises 23.7–23.9, may be discourag-
ing, but it turns out that power series do converge to continuous

§24
Uniform Convergence
We ﬁrst formalize the notion of convergence discussed prior to
Example 8 in the preceding section.
24.1 Deﬁnition.
Let (fn) be a sequence of real-valued functions deﬁned on a set S ⊆
R. The sequence (fn) converges pointwise [i.e., at each point] to a
function f deﬁned on S if
lim
n→∞fn(x) = f(x)
for all
x ∈S.
We often write lim fn = f pointwise [on S] or fn →f pointwise
[on S].

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
194
Example 1
All the functions f obtained in the last section as a limit of a se-
quence of functions were pointwise limits. See Example 8 of §23 and
Exercises 23.7–23.9. In Exercise 23.8 we have fn →0 pointwise on
R, and in Exercise 23.9 we have fn →0 pointwise on [0, 1).
Example 2
Let fn(x) = xn for x ∈[0, 1]. Then fn →f pointwise on [0, 1] where
f(x) = 0 for x ∈[0, 1) and f(1) = 1.
Now observe fn →f pointwise on S means exactly the following:
for each ϵ > 0 and x in S there exists N such that
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ϵ for n > N.
(1)
Note the value of N depends on both ϵ > 0 and x in S. If for each
ϵ > 0 we could ﬁnd N so that
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈S
and
n > N,
then the values fn(x) would be “uniformly” close to the values f(x).
Here N would depend on ϵ but not on x. This concept is extremely
useful.
24.2 Deﬁnition.
Let (fn) be a sequence of real-valued functions deﬁned on a set
S ⊆R. The sequence (fn) converges uniformly on S to a function f
deﬁned on S if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ϵ for all x ∈S and all n > N.
(1)
We write lim fn = f uniformly on S or fn →f uniformly on S.
Note that if fn →f uniformly on S and if ϵ > 0, then there exists
N such that f(x) −ϵ < fn(x) < f(x) + ϵ for all x ∈S and n > N.
In other words, for n > N the graph of fn lies in the strip between
the graphs of f −ϵ and f +ϵ. In Fig. 24.1 the graphs of fn for n > N
would all lie between the dotted curves.
We return to our earlier examples.

§24. Uniform Convergence 195
FIGURE 24.1
Example 3
Let fn(x) = (1−|x|)n for x ∈(−1, 1). Also, let f(x) = 0 for x ̸= 0 and
f(0) = 1. As noted in Example 8 of §23, fn →f pointwise on (−1, 1).
It turns out that the sequence (fn) does not converge uniformly to
f on (−1, 1) in view of the next theorem. This can also be shown
directly, as follows. Assume fn →f uniformly on (−1, 1). Then [with
ϵ = 1
2 in mind] we see there exists N in N so that |f(x) −fn(x)| < 1
2
for all x ∈(−1, 1) and n > N. Hence
x ∈(0, 1)
and
n > N
imply
|(1 −x)n| < 1
2.
In particular,
x ∈(0, 1)
implies
(1 −x)N+1 < 1
2.
However, this fails for suﬃciently small x; for example, if we set
x = 1−2−1/(N+1), then 1−x = 2−1/(N+1) and (1−x)N+1 = 2−1 = 1
2.
This contradiction shows (fn) does not converge uniformly to f on
(−1, 1) as had been assumed.
Example 4
Let fn(x) =
1
n sin nx for x ∈R. Then fn →0 pointwise on R as
shown in Exercise 23.8. In fact, fn →0 uniformly on R. To see this,

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
196
let ϵ > 0 and let N = 1
ϵ . Then for n > N and all x ∈R we have
|fn(x) −0| =

1
n sin nx
 ≤1
n < 1
N = ϵ.
Example 5
Let fn(x) = nxn for x ∈[0, 1). Since limn→∞fn(1) = limn→∞n =
+∞, we have dropped the number 1 from the domain under consid-
eration. Then fn →0 pointwise on [0, 1), as shown in Exercise 23.9.
We show the convergence is not uniform. If it were, there would exist
N in N such that
|nxn −0| < 1
for all
x ∈[0, 1)
and
n > N.
In particular, we would have (N + 1)xN+1 < 1 for all x ∈[0, 1).
But this fails for x suﬃciently close to 1. Consider, for example, the
reciprocal x of (N + 1)1/(N+1).
Example 6
As in Example 2, let fn(x) = xn for x ∈[0, 1], f(x) = 0 for x ∈
[0, 1) and f(1) = 1. Then fn →f pointwise on [0, 1], but (fn) does
not converge uniformly to f on [0, 1], as can be seen directly or by
applying the next theorem.
24.3 Theorem.
The uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. More pre-
cisely, let (fn) be a sequence of functions on a set S ⊆R, suppose
fn →f uniformly on S, and suppose S = dom(f). If each fn is
continuous at x0 in S, then f is continuous at x0. [So if each fn is
continuous on S, then f is continuous on S.]
Proof
This involves the famous “ ϵ
3 argument.” The critical inequality is
|f(x) −f(x0)| ≤|f(x) −fn(x)| + |fn(x) −fn(x0)| + |fn(x0) −f(x0)|.
(1)
If n is large enough, the ﬁrst and third terms on the right side of (1)
will be small, since fn →f uniformly. Once such n is selected, the
continuity of fn implies that the middle term will be small provided
x is close to x0.

§24. Uniform Convergence 197
For the formal proof, let ϵ > 0. There exists N in N such that
n > N
implies
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ϵ
3
for all
x ∈S.
In particular,
|fN+1(x) −f(x)| < ϵ
3
for all
x ∈S.
(2)
Since fN+1 is continuous at x0 there is a δ > 0 such that
x ∈S
and
|x −x0| < δ
imply
|fN+1(x)−fN+1(x0)| < ϵ
3; (3)
see Theorem 17.2. Now we apply (1) with n = N +1, (2) twice [once
for x and once for x0] and (3) to conclude
x ∈S
and
|x −x0| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(x0)| < 3 · ϵ
3 = ϵ.
This proves that f is continuous at x0.
One might think this theorem would be useless in practice, since
it should be easier to show a single function is continuous than
to show a sequence (fn) consists of continuous functions and the
sequence converges to f uniformly. This would no doubt be true if
f were given by a simple formula. But consider, for example,
f(x) =
∞

n=1
1
n2xn
for
x ∈[−1, 1]
or
J0(x) =
∞

n=0
(−1)n(1
2x)2n
(n!)2
for
x ∈R.
The partial sums are clearly continuous, but neither f nor J0 is given
by a simple formula. Moreover, many functions that arise in mathe-
matics and elsewhere, such as the Bessel function J0, are deﬁned by
power series. It would be very useful to know when and where power
series converge uniformly; an answer is given in §26.
24.4 Remark.
Uniform convergence can be reformulated as follows. A sequence (fn)
of functions on a set S ⊆R converges uniformly to a function f on

S if and only if
lim
n→∞sup{|f(x) −fn(x)| : x ∈S} = 0.
(1)
We leave the straightforward proof to Exercise 24.12.
According to (1) we can decide whether a sequence (fn) con-
verges uniformly to f by calculating sup{|f(x) −fn(x)| : x ∈S} for
each n. If f −fn is diﬀerentiable, we may use calculus to ﬁnd these
suprema.
Example 7
Let fn(x) =
x
1+nx2 for x ∈R. Clearly we have limn→∞fn(0) = 0. If
x ̸= 0, then limn→∞(1 + nx2) = +∞, so limn→∞fn(x) = 0. Thus
fn →0 pointwise on R. To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum of fn,
we calculate f ′
n(x) and set it equal to 0. This leads to (1 + nx2) · 1
−x(2nx) = 0 or 1 −nx2 = 0. Thus f ′
n(x) = 0 if and only if x = ±1
√n.
Further analysis or a sketch of fn leads one to conclude fn takes its
maximum at
1
√n and its minimum at −1
√n. Since fn

± 1
√n

= ±
1
2√n,
we conclude
lim
n→∞sup{|fn(x)| : x ∈S} = lim
n→∞
1
2√n = 0.
Therefore fn →0 uniformly on R by Remark 24.4.
Example 8
Let fn(x) = n2xn(1−x) for x ∈[0, 1]. Then we have limn→∞fn(1) = 0.
For x ∈[0, 1) we have limn→∞n2xn = 0 by applying Exercise 9.12,
since for x ̸= 0,
(n + 1)2xn+1
n2xn
=
n + 1
n
	2
x →x.
Hence limn→∞fn(x) = 0. Thus fn →0 pointwise on [0, 1]. Again, to
ﬁnd the maximum and minimum of fn we set its derivative equal to
0. We obtain xn(−1) + (1 −x)nxn−1 = 0 or xn−1[n −(n + 1)x] = 0.
Since fn takes the value 0 at both endpoints of the interval [0, 1], it
follows that fn takes it maximum at
n
n+1. We have

a proof is given in Theorem 37.11. Therefore we have lim(

e.
Since lim[ n2
n+1] = +∞, we conclude from (1) that lim fn(
n
n+1) = +∞;
see Exercise 12.9(a). In particular, lim sup{|fn(x)| : x ∈[0, 1]} =

25.1 Discussion.
To prove Theorem 25.2 below we merely use some basic facts about
integration which should be familiar [or believable] even if your
calculus is rusty. Speciﬁcally, we use:
(a) If g and h are integrable on [a, b] and if g(x) ≤h(x) for all
x ∈[a, b], then
 b
a g(x) dx ≤
 b
a h(x) dx. See Theorem 33.4(i).
We also use the following corollary:
(b) If g is integrable on [a, b], then


 b
a
g(x) dx
 ≤

 b
a
|g(x)| dx.
Continuous functions on closed intervals are integrable, as noted
in Discussion 19.3 and proved in Theorem 33.2.
25.2 Theorem.
Let (fn) be a sequence of continuous functions on [a, b], and suppose
fn →f uniformly on [a, b]. Then
lim
n→∞

 b
a
fn(x) dx =

f(x) dx.
(1)
Proof
By Theorem 24.3 f is continuous, so the functions fn −f are all
integrable on [a, b]. Let ϵ > 0. Since fn →f uniformly on [a, b], there
exists a number N such that |fn(x) −f(x)| <
ϵ
b−a for all x ∈[a, b]
and all n > N. Consequently n > N implies

The ﬁrst ≤follows from Discussion 25.1(b) applied to g = fn−f and
the second ≤follows from Discussion 25.1(a) applied to g = |fn −f|
and h =
ϵ
b−a; h happens to be a constant function, but this does no
harm.
The last paragraph shows that given ϵ > 0, there exists N
such that |

holds.

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
202
Recall one of the advantages of the notion of Cauchy sequence:
A sequence (sn) of real numbers can be shown to converge without
knowing its limit by simply verifying that it is a Cauchy sequence.
Clearly a similar result for sequences of functions would be valuable,
since it is likely that we will not know the limit function in advance.
What we need is the idea of “uniformly Cauchy.”
25.3 Deﬁnition.
A sequence (fn) of functions deﬁned on a set S ⊆R is uniformly
Cauchy on S if
for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < ϵ for all x ∈S and all m, n > N.
(1)
Compare this deﬁnition with that of a Cauchy sequence of real
numbers [Deﬁnition 10.8] and that of uniform convergence [Deﬁ-
nition 24.2]. It is an easy exercise to show uniformly convergent
sequences of functions are uniformly Cauchy; see Exercise 25.4. The
interesting and useful result is the converse, just as in the case of
sequences of real numbers.
25.4 Theorem.
Let (fn) be a sequence of functions deﬁned and uniformly Cauchy on
a set S ⊆R. Then there exists a function f on S such that fn →f
uniformly on S.
Proof
First we have to “ﬁnd” f. We begin by showing
for each x0 ∈S the sequence (fn(x0)) is a Cauchy
sequence of real numbers.
(1)
For each ϵ > 0, there exists N such that
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < ϵ
for
x ∈S
and
m, n > N.
In particular, we have
|fn(x0) −fm(x0)| < ϵ
for
m, n > N.
This shows (fn(x0)) is a Cauchy sequence, so (1) holds.

§25.
More on Uniform Convergence 203
Now for each x in S, assertion (1) implies limn→∞fn(x) exists;
this is proved in Theorem 10.11 which in the end depends on the
Completeness Axiom 4.4. Hence we deﬁne f(x) = limn→∞fn(x).
This deﬁnes a function f on S such that fn →f pointwise on S.
Now that we have “found” f, we need to prove fn →f uniformly
on S. Let ϵ > 0. There is a number N such that
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < ϵ
2
for all
x ∈S
and all
m, n > N.
(2)
Consider m > N and x ∈S. Assertion (2) tells us that fn(x) lies in
the open interval (fm(x) −ϵ
2, fm(x) + ϵ
2) for all n > N. Therefore,
as noted in Exercise 8.9, the limit f(x) = limn→∞fn(x) lies in the
closed interval [fm(x) −ϵ
2, fm(x) + ϵ
2]. In other words,
|f(x) −fm(x)| ≤ϵ
2
for all
x ∈S
and
m > N.
Then of course
|f(x) −fm(x)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈S
and
m > N.
This shows fm →f uniformly on S, as desired.
Theorem 25.4 is especially useful for “series of functions.” Let us
recall what ∞
k=1 ak signiﬁes when the ak’s are real numbers. This
signiﬁes limn→∞
n
k=1 ak provided this limit exists [as a real number,
+∞or −∞]. Otherwise the symbol ∞
k=1 ak has no meaning. Thus
the inﬁnite series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums n
k=1 ak.
Similar remarks apply to series of functions. A series of functions is
an expression ∞
k=0 gk or ∞
k=0 gk(x) which makes sense provided
the sequence of partial sums n
k=0 gk converges, or diverges to +∞
or −∞pointwise. If the sequence of partial sums converges uniformly
on a set S to ∞
k=0 gk, then we say the series is uniformly convergent
on S.
Example 1
Any power series is a series of functions, since ∞
k=0 akxk has the
form ∞
k=0 gk where gk(x) = akxk for all x.

1+xk is a series of functions, but is not a power series, at least
not in its present form. This is a series ∞

x
1+x for all x, g2(x) =

1+x2 for all x, etc.
Example 3
Let g be the function drawn in Fig. 25.1, and let gn(x) = g(4nx) for
all x ∈R. Then ∞
n=0(3
4)ngn(x) is a series of functions. The limit
function f is continuous on R, but has the amazing property that it is
not diﬀerentiable at any point! The proof of the nondiﬀerentiability
of f is somewhat delicate; see [62, 7.18]. A similar example is given
in Example 38.1 on page 348.
Theorems for sequences of functions translate easily into theo-
rems for series of functions. Here is an example.
25.5 Theorem.
Consider a series ∞
k=0 gk of functions on a set S ⊆R. Suppose
each gk is continuous on S and the series converges uniformly on S.
Then the series ∞
k=0 gk represents a continuous function on S.
Proof
Each partial sum fn = n
k=1 gk is continuous and the sequence (fn)
converges uniformly on S. Hence the limit function is continuous by
Theorem 24.3.

§25.
More on Uniform Convergence 205
Recall the Cauchy criterion for series  ak given in Deﬁni-
tion 14.3:
for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
n ≥m > N implies | n
k=m ak| < ϵ.
(*)
The analogue for series of functions is also useful. The sequence of
partial sums of a series ∞
k=0 gk of functions is uniformly Cauchy
on a set S if and only if the series satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion
[uniformly on S]:
for each ϵ > 0 there exists a number N such that
n ≥m > N implies | n
k=m gk(x)| < ϵ for all x ∈S.
(**)
25.6 Theorem.
If a series ∞
k=0 gk of functions satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion
uniformly on a set S, then the series converges uniformly on S.
Proof
Let fn = n
k=0 gk. The sequence (fn) of partial sums is uni-
formly Cauchy on S, so (fn) converges uniformly on S
by
Theorem 25.4.
Here is a useful corollary.
25.7 Weierstrass M-test.
Let (Mk) be a sequence of nonnegative real numbers where  Mk <
∞. If |gk(x)| ≤Mk for all x in a set S, then  gk converges
uniformly on S.
Proof
To verify the Cauchy criterion on S, let ϵ > 0. Since the series  Mk
converges, it satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion in Deﬁnition 14.3. So there
exists a number N such that
n ≥m > N
implies
n

k=m
Mk < ϵ.
Hence if n ≥m > N and x is in S, then

4. Sequences and Series of Functions
206
Thus the series  gk satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion uniformly on S,
and Theorem 25.6 shows it converges uniformly on S.
Example 4
Show ∞
n=1 2−nxn represents a continuous function f on (−2, 2), but
the convergence is not uniform.
Solution
This is a power series with radius of convergence 2. Clearly the series
does not converge at x = 2 or at x = −2, so its interval of convergence
is (−2, 2).
Consider 0 < a < 2 and note ∞
n=1 2−nan = ∞
n=1(a
2)n con-
verges. Since |2−nxn| ≤2−nan = (a
2)n for x ∈[−a, a], the Weierstrass
M-test 25.7 shows the series ∞
n=1 2−nxn converges uniformly to a
function on [−a, a]. By Theorem 25.5 the limit function f is contin-
uous at each point of the set [−a, a]. Since a can be any number less
than 2, we conclude f represents a continuous function on (−2, 2).
Since we have sup{|2−nxn| : x ∈(−2, 2)} = 1 for each n, the
convergence of the series cannot be uniform on (−2, 2) in view of the
next example.
Example 5
Show that if the series  gn converges uniformly on a set S, then
lim
n→∞sup{|gn(x)| : x ∈S} = 0.
(1)
Solution
Let ϵ > 0. Since the series  gn satisﬁes the Cauchy criterion, there
exists N such that
n ≥m > N
implies

n

k=m
gk(x)
 < ϵ
for all
x ∈S.
In particular,
n > N
implies
|gn(x)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈S.
Therefore
n > N
implies
sup{|gn(x)| : x ∈S} ≤ϵ.
This establishes (1).

§26
Diﬀerentiation and Integration of Power
Series
The following result was mentioned in §23 after Example 8.
26.1 Theorem.
Let ∞
n=0 anxn be a power series with radius of convergence R > 0
[possibly R = +∞]. If 0 < R1 < R, then the power series converges
uniformly on [−R1, R1] to a continuous function.
Proof
Consider 0 < R1 < R. A glance at Theorem 23.1 shows the se-
ries  anxn and  |an|xn have the same radius of convergence,
since β and R are deﬁned in terms of |an|. Since |R1| < R, we
have  |an|Rn
1 < ∞. Clearly we have |anxn| ≤|an|Rn
1 for all x in

§26. Diﬀerentiation and Integration of Power Series 209
[−R1, R1], so the series  anxn converges uniformly on [−R1, R1] by
the Weierstrass M-test 25.7. The limit function is continuous at each
point of [−R1, R1] by Theorem 25.5.
26.2 Corollary.
The power series  anxn converges to a continuous function on the
open interval (−R, R).
Proof
If x0 ∈(−R, R), then x0 ∈(−R1, R1) for some R1 < R. The theorem
shows the limit of the series is continuous at x0.
We emphasize that a power series need not converge uniformly
on its interval of convergence though it might; see Example 4 of §25
and Exercise 25.8.
We are going to diﬀerentiate and integrate power series term-
by-term, so clearly it would be useful to know where the new series
converge. The next lemma tells us.
26.3 Lemma.
If the power series ∞
n=0 anxn has radius of convergence R, then the
power series
∞

n=1
nanxn−1
and

n=0

n + 1xn+1

Proof
First observe the series  nanxn−1 and  nanxn have the same ra-
dius of convergence: since the second series is x times the ﬁrst series,
they converge for exactly the same values of x. Likewise  an
n+1xn+1
and  an
n+1xn have the same radius of convergence.
Next recall R =

β where β = lim sup |an|1/n. For the se-
ries  nanxn, we consider lim sup(n|an|)1/n = lim sup n1/n|an|1/n.
By Theorem 9.7(c) on page 48, we have lim n1/n

1, so
lim sup(n|an|)1/n = β by Theorem 12.1 on page 78. Hence the series
 nanxn has radius of convergence R.

For the series  an
n+1xn, we consider lim sup( |an|
n+1)1/n. It is easy
to show lim(n + 1)1/n = 1; therefore lim(
1
n+1)1/n = 1. Hence by
Theorem 12.1 we have lim sup( |an|
n+1)1/n = β, so the series  an
n+1xn
has radius of convergence R.

§26. Diﬀerentiation and Integration of Power Series 211
The proof of Theorem 26.4 was a straightforward application of
Theorem 25.2, but the direct analogue of Theorem 25.2 for deriva-
tives is not true [see Exercise 23.8 and Example 4 of §24]. So we give
a devious indirect proof of the theorem.
Proof
We begin with the series g(x) = ∞
n=1 nanxn−1 and observe this
series converges for |x| < R by Lemma 26.3. Theorem 26.4 shows
that we can integrate g term-by-term:

 x

g(t) dt =


n=1
anxn = f(x) −a0
for
|x| < R.
Thus if 0 < R1 < R, then
f(x) =

g(t) dt + k
for
|x| ≤R1,
where k is a constant; in fact, k = a0−
 0
−R1 g(t) dt. Since g is contin-
uous, one of the versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
[Theorem 34.3] shows f is diﬀerentiable and f ′(x) = g(x). Thus
f ′(x) = g(x) =

It turns out that this equality is also valid for x = 1 [see Example 2],

To establish (4) we need a relatively diﬃcult theorem about
convergence of a power series at the endpoints of its interval of
convergence.
26.6 Abel’s Theorem.
Let f(x) = ∞
n=0 anxn be a power series with ﬁnite positive radius of
convergence R. If the series converges at x = R, then f is continuous
at x = R. If the series converges at x = −R, then f is continuous
at x = −R.

As promised, we return to (3) in Example 1:
loge(1 + x) = x −x2
2 + x3
3 −x4
4 + · · ·
for
|x| < 1.

§26. Diﬀerentiation and Integration of Power Series 213
For x = 1 the series converges by the Alternating Series Theo-
rem 15.3. Thus the series represents a function f on (−1, 1] that is
continuous at x = 1 by Abel’s theorem. The function loge(1 + x)
is also continuous at x = 1, so the functions agree at x = 1.
[In detail, if (xn) is a sequence in (−1, 1) converging to 1, then
f(1) = limn→∞f(xn) = limn→∞loge(1 + xn) = loge 2.] Therefore
we have
loge 2 = 1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + 1
5 −1
6 + · · · .
Another proof of this identity is given in Example 2 of §31.
Example 3
Recall ∞
n=0 xn =
1
1−x for |x| < 1. Note that at x = −1 the function
1
1−x is continuous and takes the value 1
2. However, the series does
not converge for x = −1, so Abel’s theorem does not apply.
Proof of Abel’s Theorem
The heart of the proof is in Case 1.
Case 1. Suppose f(x) = ∞
n=0 anxn has radius of convergence 1
and the series converges at x = 1. We will prove f is continuous
on [0, 1]. By subtracting a constant from f, we may assume f(1) =
∞
n=0 an = 0. Let fn(x) = n
k=0 akxk and sn = n
k=0 ak = fn(1)
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Since fn(x) →f(x) pointwise on [0, 1] and each
fn is continuous, Theorem 24.3 on page 196 shows it suﬃces to show
fn →f uniformly on [0, 1]. Theorem 25.4 on page 202 shows it
suﬃces to show the convergence is uniformly Cauchy.
For m < n, we have
fn(x) −fm(x) =

and therefore
fn(x) −fm(x) = snxn −smxm+1 + (1 −x)
n−1

k=m+1
skxk.
(1)
Since lim sn = ∞
k=0 ak = f(1) = 0, given ϵ > 0, there is an integer N
so that |sn| < ϵ
3 for all n ≥N. Then for n > m ≥N and x in [0, 1),
we have(1 −x)

3.
(2)
The ﬁrst term in inequality (2) is also less than
ϵ
3 for x = 1.
Therefore, for n > m ≥N and x in [0, 1], (1) and (2) show
|fn(x) −fm(x)| ≤|sn|xn + |sm|xm+1 + ϵ
3 < ϵ
3 + ϵ
3 + ϵ
3 = ϵ.
Thus the sequence (fn) is uniformly Cauchy on [0, 1], and its limit
f is continuous.
Case 2. Suppose f(x) = ∞
n=0 anxn has radius of convergence R,
0 < R < ∞, and the series converges at x = R. Let g(x) = f(Rx)
and note that
g(x) =
∞

n=0
anRnxn
for
|x| < 1.
This series has radius of convergence 1, and it converges at x = 1.
By Case 1, g is continuous at x = 1. Since f(x) = g( x
R), it follows
that f is continuous at x = R.
Case 3. Suppose f(x) = ∞
n=0 anxn has radius of convergence R,
0 < R < ∞, and the series converges at x = −R. Let h(x) = f(−x)
and note that
h(x) =
∞

n=0
(−1)nanxn
for
|x| < R.
The series for h converges at x = R, so h is continuous at x = R by
Case 2. It follows that f(x) = h(−x) is continuous at x = −R.

Exercises 215
The point of view in our extremely brief introduction to power
series has been: For a given power series  anxn, what can one say
about the function f(x) =  anxn? This point of view was mis-
leading. Often, in real life, one begins with a function f and seeks a
power series that represents the function for some or all values of x.
This is because power series, being limits of polynomials, are in some
sense basic objects.
If we have f(x) = ∞
n=0 anxn for |x| < R, then we can diﬀerenti-
ate f term-by-term forever. At each step, we may calculate the kth
derivative of f at 0, written f (k)(0). It is easy to show f (k)(0) = k!ak
for k ≥0. This tells us that if f can be represented by a power series,
then that power series must be ∞
k=0
f(k)(0)
k!
xk. This is the Taylor se-
ries for f about 0. Frequently, but not always, the Taylor series will
agree with f on the interval of convergence. This turns out to be
true for many familiar functions. Thus the following relations can be
proved:

§27
* Weierstrass’s Approximation Theorem
Suppose a power series has radius of convergence greater than 1, and
let f denote the function given by the power series. Theorem 26.1
tells us that the partial sums of the power series get uniformly close
to f on [−1, 1]. In other words, f can be approximated uniformly
on [−1, 1] by polynomials. Weierstrass’s approximation theorem is
a generalization of this last observation, for it tells us that any
continuous function on [−1, 1] can be uniformly approximated by
polynomials on [−1, 1]. This result is quite diﬀerent because such a
function need not be given by a power series; see Exercise 26.7. The
approximation theorem is valid for any closed interval [a, b] and can
be deduced easily from the case [0, 1]; see Exercise 27.1.
We give the beautiful proof due to S. N. Bernstein. Bernstein
was motivated by probabilistic considerations, but we will not use

§27.
* Weierstrass’s Approximation Theorem 217
any probability here. One of the attractive features of Bernstein’s
proof is that the approximating polynomials will be given explicitly.
There are more abstract proofs in which this is not the case. On the
other hand, the abstract proofs lead to far-reaching and important
generalizations. See the treatment in [31] or [62].
We need some preliminary facts about polynomials involving
binomial coeﬃcients.

For every continuous function f on [0, 1], we have
Bnf →f
uniformly on
[0, 1].
Proof
We assume f is not identically zero, and we let
M = sup{|f(x)| : x ∈[0, 1]}.
Consider ϵ > 0. Since f is uniformly continuous by Theorem 19.2,
there exists δ > 0 such that
x, y ∈[0, 1]
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| < ϵ

Let N = M
ϵδ2 . This choice of N is unmotivated at this point, but we
make it here to emphasize that it does not depend on the choice of x.
We will show
|Bnf(x) −f(x)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈[0, 1]
and all
n > N,

27.5 Weierstrass’s Approximation Theorem.
Every continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] can be uniformly
approximated by polynomials on [a, b].
In other words, given a continuous function f on [a, b], there exists
a sequence (pn) of polynomials such that pn →f uniformly on [a, b].
27.6 Corollary.
Given a continuous function f on [a, b], there exists a sequence (pn)
of polynomials such that pn →f uniformly on [a, b], and for each n,
pn(a) = f(a) and pn(b) = f(b).
Proof
See Exercise 27.4.

Diﬀerentiation
In this chapter we give a theoretical treatment of diﬀerentiation and
related concepts, most or all of which will be familiar from the stan-
dard calculus course. Three of the most useful results are the Mean
Value Theorem which is treated in §29, L’Hospital’s Rule which is
treated in §30, and Taylor’s Theorem which is given in §31.
§28
Basic Properties of the Derivative
The reader may wish to review the theory of limits treated in §20.
28.1 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a real-valued function deﬁned on an open interval containing
a point a. We say f is diﬀerentiable at a, or f has a derivative at a,
if the limit

exists and is ﬁnite. We will write f ′(a) for the derivative of f at a:
f ′(a) = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
(1)
whenever this limit exists and is ﬁnite.
Generally speaking, we will be interested in f ′ as a function in
its own right. The domain of f ′ is the set of points at which f is
diﬀerentiable; thus dom(f ′) ⊆dom(f).
Example 1
The derivative of the function g(x) = x2 at x = 2 was calculated in
Example 2 of §20:
g′(2) = lim
x→2
x2 −4
x −2 = lim
x→2(x + 2) = 4.
We can calculate g′(a) just as easily:
g′(a) = lim
x→a
x2 −a2
x −a
= lim
x→a(x + a) = 2a.
This computation is even valid for a = 0. We may write g′(x) = 2x
since the name of the variable a or x is immaterial. Thus the deriva-
tive of the function given by g(x) = x2 is the function given by
g′(x) = 2x, as every calculus student knows.
Example 2
The derivative of h(x) = √x at x = 1 was calculated in Example 3
of §20: h′(1) = 1
2. In fact, h(x) = x1/2 for x ≥0 and h′(x) = 1
2x−1/2
for x > 0; see Exercise 28.3.
Example 3
Let n be a positive integer, and let f(x) = xn for all x ∈R. We show
f ′(x) = nxn−1 for all x ∈R. Fix a in R and observe
f(x)−f(a) = xn−an = (x−a)(xn−1+axn−2+a2xn−3+· · ·+an−2x+an−1),
so
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
= xn−1 + axn−2 + a2xn−3 + · · · + an−2x + an−1

for x ̸= a. It follows that
f ′(a) = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
= an−1 + aan−2 + a2an−3 + · · · + an−2a + an−1 = nan−1;
we are using Theorem 20.4 and the fact that limx→a xk = ak for k
in N.
We ﬁrst prove diﬀerentiability at a point implies continuity at
the point. This may seem obvious from all the pictures of familiar
diﬀerentiable functions. However, Exercise 28.8 contains an example
of a function that is diﬀerentiable at 0 and of course continuous at
0 [by the next theorem], but is discontinuous at all other points.
28.2 Theorem.
If f is diﬀerentiable at a point a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof
We are given f ′(a) = limx→a
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
, and we need to prove
limx→a f(x) = f(a). We have
f(x) = (x −a)f(x) −f(a)
x −a
+ f(a)
for x ∈dom(f), x ̸= a. Since limx→a(x−a) = 0 and limx→a
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
exists
and
is
ﬁnite,
Theorem
20.4(ii)
shows
limx→a(x −a)·
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
= 0. Therefore limx→a f(x) = f(a), as desired.
We next prove some results about sums, products, etc. of deriva-
tives. Let us ﬁrst recall why the product rule is not (fg)′ = f ′g′
[as many naive calculus students wish!] even though the product of
limits does behave as expected:
lim
x→a(f1f2)(x) =

lim
x→a f1(x)

·

lim
x→a f2(x)

provided the limits on the right side exist and are ﬁnite; see Theo-
rem 20.4(ii). The diﬃculty is that the limit for the derivative of the
product is not the product of the limits of the derivatives, i.e.,
f(x)g(x) −f(a)g(a)
x −a
̸= f(x) −f(a)
x −a
· g(x) −g(a)
x −a
.

5. Diﬀerentiation
226
The correct product rule is obtained by shrewdly writing the left
hand side in terms of
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
and
g(x)−g(a)
x−a
as in the proof of
Theorem 28.3(iii) below.
28.3 Theorem.
Let f and g be functions that are diﬀerentiable at the point a. Each of
the functions cf [c a constant], f+g, fg and f/g is also diﬀerentiable
at a, except f/g if g(a) = 0 since f/g is not deﬁned at a in this case.
The formulas are
(i) (cf)′(a) = c · f ′(a);
(ii) (f + g)′(a) = f ′(a) + g′(a);
(iii) [product rule] (fg)′(a) = f(a)g′(a) + f ′(a)g(a);
(iv) [quotient rule] (f/g)′(a) = [g(a)f ′(a) −f(a)g′(a)]/g2(a) if
g(a) ̸= 0.
Proof
(i) By deﬁnition of cf we have (cf)(x) = c · f(x) for all x ∈
dom(f); hence
(cf)′(a) = lim
x→a
(cf)(x) −(cf)(a)
x −a
= lim
x→a c·f(x) −f(a)
x −a
= c·f ′(a).
(ii) This follows from the identity
(f + g)(x) −(f + g)(a)
x −a
= f(x) −f(a)
x −a
+ g(x) −g(a)
x −a
upon taking the limit as x →a and applying Theorem 20.4(i).
(iii) Observe
(fg)(x) −(fg)(a)
x −a
= f(x)g(x) −g(a)
x −a
+ g(a)f(x) −f(a)
x −a
for x ∈dom(fg), x ̸= a. We take the limit as x →a and note
that limx→a f(x) = f(a) by Theorem 28.2. We obtain [again
using Theorem 20.4]
(fg)′(a) = f(a)g′(a) + g(a)f ′(a).
(iv) Since g(a) ̸= 0 and g is continuous at a, there exists an open
interval I containing a such that g(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈I. For x ∈I
we can write

§28.
Basic Properties of the Derivative 227
(f/g)(x) −(f/g)(a) = f(x)
g(x) −f(a)
g(a) = g(a)f(x) −f(a)g(x)
g(x)g(a)
= g(a)f(x) −g(a)f(a) + g(a)f(a) −f(a)g(x)
g(x)g(a)
,
so
(f/g)(x) −(f/g)(a)
x −a
=

x −a
−f(a)g(x) −g(a)

g(x)g(a)
for x ∈I, x ̸= a. Now we take the limit as x →a to obtain
(iv); note that limx→a
1
g(x)g(a) =
1
g2(a).
Example 4
Let m be a positive integer, and let h(x) = x−m for x ̸= 0. Then
h(x) = f(x)/g(x) where f(x) = 1 and g(x) = xm for all x. By the
quotient rule,
h′(a) = g(a)f ′(a) −f(a)g′(a)
g2(a)
= am · 0 −1 · mam−1
a2m
= −m
am+1 = −ma−m−1
for a ̸= 0. If we write n for −m, then we see the derivative of xn
is nxn−1 for negative integers n as well as for positive integers. The
result is also trivially valid for n = 0. For fractional exponents, see
Exercise 29.15.
28.4 Theorem [Chain Rule].
If f is diﬀerentiable at a and g is diﬀerentiable at f(a), then the
composite function g◦f is diﬀerentiable at a and we have (g◦f)′(a) =
g′(f(a)) · f ′(a).
Discussion. Here is a faulty “proof” which nevertheless contains
the essence of a valid proof. We write
g ◦f(x) −g ◦f(a)
x −a
= g(f(x)) −g(f(a))
f(x) −f(a)
· f(x) −f(a)
x −a
(1)

5. Diﬀerentiation
228
for x ̸= a. Since limx→a f(x) = f(a), we have
lim
x→a
g(f(x)) −g(f(a))
f(x) −f(a)
=
lim
y→f(a)
g(y) −g(f(a))
y −f(a)
= g′(f(a)).
(2)
We also have limx→a
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
= f ′(a), so (1) shows (g ◦f)′(a) =
g′(f(a)) · f ′(a).
The main problem with this “proof” is that f(x)−f(a) in Eq. (2)
might be 0 for x arbitrarily close to a. If, however, f(x) ̸= f(a) for
x near a, then this proof can be made rigorous. If f(x) = f(a) for
some x’s near a, the “proof” cannot be repaired using (2). In fact,
Exercise 28.5 gives an example of diﬀerentiable functions f and g for
which limx→0
g(f(x))−g(f(0))
f(x)−f(0)
is meaningless.
We now give a rigorous proof, but we will use the sequential
deﬁnition of a limit. The proof reﬂects ideas in the article by Stephen
Kenton [36].
Proof
The hypotheses include the assumptions that f is deﬁned on an
open interval J containing a, and g is deﬁned on an open interval
I containing f(a). It is easy to check g ◦f is deﬁned on some open
interval containing a (see Exercise 28.13), so by taking J smaller if
necessary, we may assume g ◦f is deﬁned on J.
By Deﬁnitions 20.3(a) and 20.1, it suﬃces to consider a sequence
(xn) in J \ {a} where limn xn = a and show
lim
n→∞
g ◦f(xn) −g ◦f(a)
xn −a
= g′(f(a)) · f ′(a).
(3)
For each n, let yn = f(xn). Since f is continuous at x = a, we have
limn yn = f(a). For f(xn) ̸= f(a),
(g ◦f)(xn) −(g ◦f)(a)
xn −a
= g(yn) −g(f(a))
yn −f(a)
· f(xn) −f(a)
xn −a
.
(4)
Case 1. Suppose f(x) ̸= f(a) for x near a. Then yn = f(xn) ̸=
f(a) for large n, so taking the limit in (4), as n →∞, we obtain
(g ◦f)′(a) = g′(f(a)) · f ′(a).

§28.
Basic Properties of the Derivative 229
Case 2. Suppose f(x) = f(a) for x arbitrarily close to a. Then
there is a sequence (zn) in J \{a} such that limn zn = a and f(zn) =
f(a) for all n. Then
f ′(a) = lim
n→∞
f(zn) −f(a)
zn −a
= lim
n→∞
0
zn −a = 0,
and it suﬃces to show (g ◦f)′(a) = 0. We do have
lim
n→∞
g(f(zn)) −g(f(a))
zn −a
= lim
n→∞
0
zn −a = 0,
but this only assures us that (g ◦f)′(a) = 0 provided we know this
derivative exists. To help us prove this, we note g′(f(a)) exists and
so the diﬀerence quotients g(y)−g(f(a))
y−f(a)
are bounded near f(a). Thus,
replacing the open interval I by a smaller one if necessary, there is
a constant C > 0 so that

g(y) −g(f(a))
y −f(a)
 ≤C
for
y ∈I \ f(a).
Therefore

(g ◦f)(xn) −(g ◦f)(a)
xn −a
 ≤C

f(xn) −f(a)
xn −a

for large
n,
(5)
which is clear if f(xn) = f(a) and otherwise follows from Eq. (4).
Since f ′(a) = 0, the right side of (5) tends to 0 as n →∞; thus
the left side also tends to 0. Since (xn) is any sequence in J \ {a}
converging to a, we conclude (g ◦f)′(a) = 0, as desired.
It is worth emphasizing that if f is diﬀerentiable on an interval I
and if g is diﬀerentiable on {f(x) : x ∈I}, then (g ◦f)′ is exactly
the function (g′ ◦f) · f ′ on I.
Example 5
Let h(x) = sin(x3 + 7x) for x ∈R. The reader can undoubtedly
verify h′(x) = (3x2 + 7) cos(x3 + 7x) for x ∈R using some automatic
technique learned in calculus. Whatever the automatic technique, it
is justiﬁed by the chain rule. In this case, h = g ◦f where f(x) =
x3 + 7x and g(y) = sin y. Then f ′(x) = 3x2 + 7 and g′(y) = cos y so
that
h′(x) = g′(f(x))·f ′(x) = [cos f(x)]·f ′(x) = [cos(x3 +7x)]·(3x2 +7).

5. Diﬀerentiation
230
We do not want the reader to unlearn the automatic technique, but
the reader should be aware that the chain rule stands behind it.

§29
The Mean Value Theorem
Our ﬁrst result justiﬁes the following strategy in calculus: To ﬁnd the
maximum and minimum of a continuous function f on an interval
[a, b] it suﬃces to consider (a) the points x where f ′(x) = 0; (b) the
points where f is not diﬀerentiable; and (c) the endpoints a and b.
These are the candidates for maxima and minima.
29.1 Theorem.
If f is deﬁned on an open interval containing x0, if f assumes its
maximum or minimum at x0, and if f is diﬀerentiable at x0, then
f ′(x0) = 0.
Proof
We suppose f is deﬁned on (a, b) where a < x0 < b. Since either f
or −f assumes its maximum at x0, we may assume f assumes its
maximum at x0.
Assume ﬁrst that f ′(x0) > 0. Since
f ′(x0) = lim
x→x0
f(x) −f(x0)
x −x0
,

§29.
The Mean Value Theorem 233
there exists δ > 0 such that a < x0 −δ < x0 + δ < b and
0 < |x −x0| < δ
implies
f(x) −f(x0)
x −x0
> 0;
(1)
see Corollary 20.7. If we select x so that x0 < x < x0 + δ, then (1)
shows f(x) > f(x0), contrary to the assumption that f assumes its
maximum at x0. Likewise, if f ′(x0) < 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < |x −x0| < δ
implies
f(x) −f(x0)
x −x0
< 0.
(2)
If we select x so that x0 −δ < x < x0, then (2) implies f(x) > f(x0),
again a contradiction. Thus we have f ′(x0) = 0.
Our next result is fairly obvious except for one subtle point: one
needs to know or believe that a continuous function on a closed
interval assumes its maximum and minimum. We proved this in
Theorem 18.1 using the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
29.2 Rolle’s Theorem.
Let f be a continuous function on [a, b] that is diﬀerentiable on (a, b)
and satisﬁes f(a) = f(b). There exists [at least one] x in (a, b) such
that f ′(x) = 0.
Proof
By Theorem 18.1, there exist x0, y0 ∈[a, b] such that f(x0) ≤f(x) ≤
f(y0) for all x ∈[a, b]. If x0 and y0 are both endpoints of [a, b], then
f is a constant function [since f(a) = f(b)] and f ′(x) = 0 for all
x ∈(a, b). Otherwise, f assumes either a maximum or a minimum
at a point x in (a, b), in which case f ′(x) = 0 by Theorem 29.1.
The Mean Value Theorem tells us that a diﬀerentiable function
on [a, b] must somewhere have its derivative equal to the slope of the
line connecting (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)), namely f(b)−f(a)
b−a
. See Fig. 29.1.
29.3 Mean Value Theorem.
Let f be a continuous function on [a, b] that is diﬀerentiable on (a, b).
Then there exists [at least one] x in (a, b) such that

FIGURE 29.1
f ′(x) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
(1)
Note that Rolle’s Theorem is the special case of the Mean Value
Theorem where f(a) = f(b).
Proof
Let L be the function whose graph is the straight line connect-
ing (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)), i.e., the dotted line in Fig. 29.1. Observe
L(a) = f(a), L(b) = f(b) and L′(x) =
f(b)−f(a)
b−a
for all x. Let
g(x) = f(x) −L(x) for x ∈[a, b]. Clearly g is continuous on [a, b]
and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). Also g(a) = 0 = g(b), so g′(x) = 0
for some x ∈(a, b) by Rolle’s Theorem 29.2. For this x, we have
f ′(x) = L′(x) = f(b)−f(a)
b−a
.
29.4 Corollary.
Let f be a diﬀerentiable function on (a, b) such that f ′(x) = 0 for all
x ∈(a, b). Then f is a constant function on (a, b).
Proof
If f is not constant on (a, b), then there exist x1, x2 such that
a < x1 < x2 < b
and
f(x1) ̸= f(x2).
By the Mean Value Theorem, for some x ∈(x1, x2) we have f ′(x) =
f(x2)−f(x1)
x2−x1
̸= 0, a contradiction.

§29.
The Mean Value Theorem 235
29.5 Corollary.
Let f and g be diﬀerentiable functions on (a, b) such that f ′ = g′ on
(a, b). Then there exists a constant c such that f(x) = g(x) + c for
all x ∈(a, b).
Proof
Apply Corollary 29.4 to the function f −g.
Corollary 29.5 is important for integral calculus because it guar-
antees all antiderivatives, alias indeﬁnite integrals, for a function
diﬀer by a constant. Old integral tables and modern computational
software programs provide formulas like

x2 cos x dx = 2x cos x + (x2 −2) sin x + C.
It is straightforward to show the derivative of each function 2x cos x+
(x2 −2) sin x + C is in fact x2 cos x. Corollary 29.5 shows that these
are the only antiderivatives of x2 cos x.
We need some terminology in order to give another useful
corollary of the Mean Value Theorem.
29.6 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a real-valued function deﬁned on an interval I. We say f is
strictly increasing on I if
x1, x2 ∈I
and
x1 < x2
imply
f(x1) < f(x2),
strictly decreasing on I if
x1, x2 ∈I
and
x1 < x2
imply
f(x1) > f(x2),
increasing on I if
x1, x2 ∈I
and
x1 < x2
imply
f(x1) ≤f(x2),
and decreasing on I if
x1, x2 ∈I
and
x1 < x2
imply
f(x1) ≥f(x2).
Example 1
The functions ex on R and √x on [0, ∞) are strictly increasing. The
function cos x is strictly decreasing on [0, π]. The signum function
and the postage-stamp function in Exercises 17.10 and 17.16 are
increasing functions but not strictly increasing functions.

29.7 Corollary.
Let f be a diﬀerentiable function on an interval (a, b). Then
(i) f is strictly increasing if f ′(x) > 0 for all x ∈(a, b);
(ii) f is strictly decreasing if f ′(x) < 0 for all x ∈(a, b);
(iii) f is increasing if f ′(x) ≥0 for all x ∈(a, b);
(iv) f is decreasing if f ′(x) ≤0 for all x ∈(a, b).
Proof
(i) Consider x1, x2 where a < x1 < x2 < b. By the Mean Value
Theorem, for some x ∈(x1, x2) we have
f(x2) −f(x1)
x2 −x1
= f ′(x) > 0.
Since x2 −x1 > 0, we see f(x2) −f(x1) > 0 or f(x2) > f(x1).
The remaining cases are left to Exercise 29.8.
Exercise 28.4 shows the derivative f ′ of a diﬀerentiable function
f need not be continuous. Nevertheless, like a continuous function,
f ′ has the intermediate value property [see Theorem 18.2].
29.8 Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives.
Let f be a diﬀerentiable function on (a, b). If a < x1 < x2 < b, and
if c lies between f ′(x1) and f ′(x2), there exists [at least one] x in
(x1, x2) such that f ′(x) = c.
Proof
We may assume f ′(x1) < c < f ′(x2). Let g(x) = f(x) −cx for
x ∈(a, b). Then we have g′(x1) < 0 < g′(x2). Theorem 18.1 shows g
assumes its minimum on [x1, x2] at some point x0 ∈[x1, x2]. Since
g′(x1) = lim
y→x1
g(y) −g(x1)
y −x1
< 0,
g(y)−g(x1) is negative for y close to and larger than x1. In particular,
there exists y1 in (x1, x2) such that g(y1) < g(x1). Therefore g does
not take its minimum at x1, so we have x0 ̸= x1. Similarly, there
exists y2 in (x1, x2) such that g(y2) < g(x2), so x0 ̸= x2. We have
shown x0 is in (x1, x2), so g′(x0) = 0 by Theorem 29.1. Therefore
f ′(x0) = g′(x0) + c = c.

§29.
The Mean Value Theorem 237
We next show how to diﬀerentiate the inverse of a diﬀerentiable
function. Let f be a one-to-one diﬀerentiable function on an open
interval I. By Theorem 18.6, f is strictly increasing or strictly de-
creasing on I, and by Corollary 18.3 the image f(I) is an interval J.
The set J is the domain of f −1 and
f −1 ◦f(x) = x
for
x ∈I;
f ◦f −1(y) = y
for
y ∈J.
The formula for the derivative of f −1 is easy to obtain [or remember]
from the Chain Rule: x = f −1 ◦f(x), so
1 = (f −1)′(f(x)) · f ′(x)
for all
x ∈I.
If x0 ∈I and y0 = f(x0), then we can write 1 = (f −1)′(y0)·f ′(x0) or
(f −1)′(y0) =
1
f ′(x0)
where
y0 = f(x0).
This is not a proof because the Chain Rule requires the functions, f −1
and f in this case, be diﬀerentiable. We assumed f is diﬀerentiable,
but we must prove f −1 is also diﬀerentiable. In addition, observe
f ′(x0) might be 0 [consider f(x) = x3 at x0 = 0], so our ﬁnal result
will have to avoid this possibility.
29.9 Theorem.
Let f be a one-to-one continuous function on an open interval I, and
let J = f(I). If f is diﬀerentiable at x0 ∈I and if f ′(x0) ̸= 0, then
f −1 is diﬀerentiable at y0 = f(x0) and
(f −1)′(y0) =
1
f ′(x0).
Proof
Note that J is also an open interval. We have limx→x0
f(x)−f(x0)
x−x0
=
f ′(x0). Since f ′(x0) ̸= 0 and since f(x) ̸= f(x0) for x near x0, we
can write
lim
x→x0
x −x0
f(x) −f(x0) =
1
f ′(x0);
(1)
see Theorem 20.4(iii). Let ϵ > 0. By (1) and Corollary 20.7, there
exists δ > 0 such that
0 < |x −x0| < δ
implies

x −x0
f(x) −f(x0) −
1
f ′(x0)
 < ϵ.
(2)

5. Diﬀerentiation
238
Let g = f −1 and observe that g is continuous at y0 by Theorems 18.6
and 18.4 [or Exercise 18.11]. Hence there exists η > 0 [lower case
Greek eta] such that
0 < |y −y0| < η
implies
|g(y) −g(y0)| < δ,
i.e., |g(y) −x0| < δ.
(3)
Combining (3) and (2) we obtain
0 < |y −y0| < η
implies

g(y) −x0
f(g(y)) −f(x0) −
1
f ′(x0)
 < ϵ.
Since
g(y)−x0
f(g(y))−f(x0) = g(y)−g(y0)
y−y0
, this shows
lim
y→y0
g(y) −g(y0)
y −y0
=
1
f ′(x0).
Hence g′(y0) exists and equals
1
f′(x0).
Example 2
Let n be a positive integer, and let g(y) =
n√y = y1/n. If n is even, the
domain of g is [0, ∞) and, if n is odd, the domain is R. In either case,
g is strictly increasing and its inverse is f(x) = xn; here dom(f) =
[0, ∞) if n is even. Consider y0 in dom(g) where y0 ̸= 0, and write
y0 = xn
0 where x0 ∈dom(f). Since f ′(x0) = nxn−1
0
, Theorem 29.9
shows
g′(y0) =
1
nxn−1
0
=
1
ny(n−1)/n
0
= 1
ny1/n−1
0
.
This shows the function g is diﬀerentiable for y ̸= 0 and the rule
for diﬀerentiating xn holds for exponents of the form 1/n; see also
Exercise 29.15.
Theorem 29.9 applies to the various inverse functions encountered
in calculus. We give one example.
Example 3
The function f(x) = sin x is one-to-one on [−π
2, π
2], and it is tradi-
tional to use the inverse g of f restricted to this domain; g is usually
denoted Sin−1 or arcsin. Note that dom(g) = [−1, 1]. For y0 = sin x0
in (−1, 1) where x0 ∈(−π
2, π
2), Theorem 29.9 shows g′(y0) =
1
cos x0.

Exercises 239
Since 1 = sin2 x0 + cos2 x0 = y2
0 + cos2 x0 and cos x0 > 0, we may
write
g′(y0) =
1

1 −y2
0
for
y0 ∈(−1, 1).

§30. * L’Hospital’s Rule 241
§30
* L’Hospital’s Rule
In analysis one frequently encounters limits of the form
lim
x→s
f(x)
g(x)
where s signiﬁes a, a+, a−, ∞or −∞. See Deﬁnition 20.3 concerning
such limits. The limit exists and is simply limx→s f(x)
limx→s g(x) provided the
limits limx→s f(x) and limx→s g(x) exist and are ﬁnite and provided
limx→s g(x) ̸= 0; see Theorem 20.4. If these limits lead to an inde-
terminate form such as 0
0 or ∞
∞, then L’Hospital’s rule can often be
used. Moreover, other indeterminate forms, such as ∞−∞, 1∞, ∞0,
00 or 0 · ∞, can usually be reformulated so as to take the form 0
0 or
∞
∞; see Examples 5–9. Before we state and prove L’Hospital’s rule,
we will prove a generalized mean value theorem.
30.1 Generalized Mean Value Theorem.
Let f and g be continuous functions on [a, b] that are diﬀerentiable
on (a, b). Then there exists [at least one] x in (a, b) such that
f ′(x)[g(b) −g(a)] = g′(x)[f(b) −f(a)].
(1)
This result reduces to the standard Mean Value Theorem 29.3
when g is the function given by g(x) = x for all x.
Proof
The trick is to look at the diﬀerence of the two quantities in (1) and
hope Rolle’s Theorem will help. Thus we deﬁne
h(x) = f(x)[g(b) −g(a)] −g(x)[f(b) −f(a)];
it suﬃces to show h′(x) = 0 for some x ∈(a, b). Note
h(a) = f(a)[g(b) −g(a)] −g(a)[f(b) −f(a)] = f(a)g(b) −g(a)f(b)
and
h(b) = f(b)[g(b) −g(a)] −g(b)[f(b) −f(a)] = −f(b)g(a) + g(b)f(a) = h(a).
Clearly h is continuous on [a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b), so Rolle’s
Theorem 29.2 shows h′(x) = 0 for at least one x in (a, b).

5. Diﬀerentiation
242
Our proof of L’Hospital’s rule below is somewhat wordy but is
really quite straightforward. It is based on the elegant presentation
in Rudin [62]. Many texts give more complicated proofs.
30.2 L’Hospital’s Rule.
Let s signify a, a+, a−, ∞or −∞where a ∈R, and suppose f and
g are diﬀerentiable functions for which the following limit exists:
lim
x→s
f ′(x)
g′(x) = L.
(1)
If
lim
x→s f(x) = lim
x→s g(x) = 0
(2)
or if
lim
x→s |g(x)| = +∞,
(3)
then
lim
x→s
f(x)
g(x) = L.
(4)
Note that the hypothesis (1) includes some implicit assumptions:
f and g must be deﬁned and diﬀerentiable “near” s and g′(x) must be
nonzero “near” s. For example, if limx→a+ f′(x)
g′(x) exists, then there is
an interval (a, b) on which f and g are diﬀerentiable and g′ is nonzero.
The requirement that g′ be nonzero is crucial; see Exercise 30.7.
Proof
We ﬁrst make some reductions. The case of limx→a follows from the
cases limx→a+ and limx→a−, since limx→a h(x) exists if and only if
the limits limx→a+ h(x) and limx→a−h(x) exist and are equal; see
Theorem 20.10. In fact, we restrict our attention to limx→a+ and
limx→−∞, since the other two cases are treated in an entirely analo-
gous manner. Finally, we are able to handle these cases together in
view of Remark 20.11.

§30. * L’Hospital’s Rule 243
We assume a ∈R or a = −∞. We will show that if −∞≤L < ∞
and L1 > L, then there exists α1 > a such that
a < x < α1
implies
f(x)
g(x) < L1.
(5)
A similar argument [which we omit] shows that if −∞< L ≤∞and
L2 < L, then there exists α2 > a such that
a < x < α2
implies
f(x)
g(x) > L2.
(6)
We now show how to complete the proof using (5) and (6); (5) will
be proved in the next paragraph. If L is ﬁnite and ϵ > 0, we can
apply (5) to L1 = L + ϵ and (6) to L2 = L −ϵ to obtain α1 > a and
α2 > a satisfying
a < x < α1
implies
f(x)
g(x) < L + ϵ,
a < x < α2
implies
f(x)
g(x) > L −ϵ.
Consequently if α = min{α1, α2} then
a < x < α
implies

f(x)
g(x) −L
 < ϵ;
in view of Remark 20.11 this shows limx→a+ f(x)
g(x) = L [if a = −∞,
then a+ = −∞]. If L = −∞, then (5) and the fact that L1 is
arbitrary show limx→a+ f(x)
g(x) = −∞. If L = ∞, then (6) and the fact
that L2 is arbitrary show limx→a+ f(x)
g(x) = ∞.
It remains for us to consider L1 > L ≥−∞and show there
exists α1 > a satisfying (5). Let (a, b) be an interval on which f and
g are diﬀerentiable and on which g′ never vanishes. Theorem 29.8
shows either g′ is positive on (a, b) or else g′ is negative on (a, b).
The former case can be reduced to the latter case by replacing g
by −g. So we assume g′(x) < 0 for x ∈(a, b), so that g is strictly
decreasing on (a, b) by Corollary 29.7. Since g is one-to-one on (a, b),
g(x) can equal 0 for at most one x in (a, b). By choosing b smaller if
necessary, we may assume g never vanishes on (a, b). Now select K

5. Diﬀerentiation
244
so that L < K < L1. By (1) there exists α > a such that
a < x < α
implies
f ′(x)
g′(x) < K.
If a < x < y < α, then Theorem 30.1 shows
f(x) −f(y)
g(x) −g(y) = f ′(z)
g′(z)
for some
z ∈(x, y).
Therefore
a < x < y < α
implies
f(x) −f(y)
g(x) −g(y) < K.
(7)
If hypothesis (2) holds, then
lim
x→a+
f(x) −f(y)
g(x) −g(y) = f(y)
g(y),
so (7) shows
f(y)
g(y) ≤K < L1
for
a < y < α;
hence (5) holds in this case. If hypothesis (3) holds, then limx→a+
g(x) = +∞since g is strictly decreasing on (a, b). Also g(x) > 0 for
x ∈(a, b) since g never vanishes on (a, b). We multiply both sides
of (7) by g(x)−g(y)
g(x)
, which is positive, to see
a < x < y < α
implies
f(x) −f(y)
g(x)
< K · g(x) −g(y)
g(x)
and hence
f(x)
g(x) < K · g(x) −g(y)
g(x)
+ f(y)
g(x) = K + f(y) −Kg(y)
g(x)
.
We regard y as ﬁxed and observe
lim
x→a+
f(y) −Kg(y)
g(x)
= 0.
Hence there exists α2 > a such that α2 ≤y < α and
a < x < α2
implies
f(x)
g(x) ≤K < L1.
Thus again (5) holds.

§30. * L’Hospital’s Rule 245
Example 1
If we assume familiar properties of the trigonometric functions, then
limx→0 sin x
x
is easy to calculate by L’Hospital’s rule:
lim
x→0
sin x
x
= lim
x→0
cos x
1
= cos(0) = 1.
(1)
Note f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x satisfy the hypotheses in Theo-
rem 30.2. This particular computation is really dishonest, because
the limit (1) is needed to prove the derivative of sin x is cos x. This
fact reduces to the assertion that the derivative of sin x at 0 is 1, i.e.,
to the assertion
lim
x→0
sin x −sin 0
x −0
= lim
x→0
sin x
x
= 1.
Example 2
We calculate limx→0 cos x−1
x2
. L’Hospital’s rule will apply provided the
limit limx→0 −sin x
2x
exists. but −sin x
2x
= −1
2
sin x
x
and this has limit −1
2
by Example 1. We conclude
lim
x→0
cos x −1
x2
= −1
2.
Example 3
We show limx→∞x2
e3x = 0. As written we have an indeterminate
of the form ∞
∞. By L’Hospital’s rule, this limit will exist provided
limx→∞
2x
3e3x exists and by L’Hospital’s rule again, this limit will
exist provided limx→∞
2
9e3x exists. The last limit is 0, so we conclude
limx→∞x2
e3x = 0.
Example 4
Consider limx→0+ loge x
x
if it exists. By L’Hospital’s rule, this appears
to be
lim
x→0+
1/x
1
= +∞
and yet this is incorrect. The diﬃculty is that we should have checked
the hypotheses. Since limx→0+ loge x = −∞and limx→0+ x = 0,
neither of the hypotheses (2) or (3) in Theorem 30.2 hold. To

5. Diﬀerentiation
246
ﬁnd the limit, we rewrite
loge x
x
as −loge(1/x)
x
. It is easy to show
limx→0+ loge(1/x)
x
will agree with limy→∞y loge y provided the lat-
ter limit exists; see Exercise 30.4. It follows that limx→0+ loge x
x
=
−limy→∞y loge y = −∞.
The next ﬁve examples illustrate how indeterminate limits of
various forms can be modiﬁed so that L’Hospital’s rule applies.
Example 5
Consider limx→0+ x loge x. As written this limit is of the indetermi-
nate form 0 · (−∞) since limx→0+ x = 0 and limx→0+ loge x = −∞.
By writing x loge x as loge x
1/x
we obtain an indeterminate of the form
−∞
∞, so we may apply L’Hospital’s rule:
lim
x→0+ x loge x = lim
x→0+
loge x
1
x
= lim
x→0+
1
x
−1
x2
= −lim
x→0+ x = 0.
We could also write x loge x as
x
1/ loge x to obtain an indeterminate
of the form 0
0. However, an attempt to apply L’Hospital’s rule only
makes the problem more complicated:
lim
x→0+ x loge x = lim
x→0+
x
1
loge x
= lim
x→0+
1
−1
x(loge x)2
= −lim
x→0+ x(loge x)2.
Example 6
The limit limx→0+ xx is of the indeterminate form 00. We write xx as
ex loge x [remember x = eloge x] and note that limx→0+ x loge x = 0 by
Example 5. Since g(x) = ex is continuous at 0, Theorem 20.5 shows
lim
x→0+ xx = lim
x→0+ ex loge x = e0 = 1.
Example 7
The limit limx→∞x1/x is of the indeterminate form ∞0. We write
x1/x as e(loge x)/x. By L’Hospital’s rule
lim
x→∞
loge x
x
= lim
x→∞
1
x
1 = 0.
Theorem 20.5 now shows limx→∞x1/x = e0 = 1.

§30. * L’Hospital’s Rule 247
Example 8
The limit limx→∞(1 −1
x)x is indeterminate of the form 1∞. Since

as should have been expected since limn→∞(1 −1

Example 9
Consider limx→0 h(x) where
h(x) =
1
ex −1 −1
x = (ex −1)−1 −x−1
for
x ̸= 0.
Neither of the limits limx→0(ex −1)−1 or limx→0 x−1 exists, so
limx→0 h(x) is not an indeterminate form as written. However,
limx→0+ h(x) is indeterminate of the form ∞−∞and limx→0−h(x)
is indeterminate of the form (−∞) −(−∞). By writing
h(x) = x −ex + 1
x(ex −1)
the limit limx→0 h(x) becomes an indeterminate of the form 0
0. By
L’Hospital’s rule this should be
lim
x→0
1 −ex
xex + ex −1,
which is still indeterminate 0
0. Note xex + ex −1 ̸= 0 for x ̸= 0
so that the hypotheses of Theorem 30.2 hold. Applying L’Hospital’s
rule again, we obtain
lim

xex + 2ex = −1

The requirement in Theorem 30.2 that g′(x) ̸= 0 for x “near” s is

Consider a power series with radius of convergence R > 0 [R may
be +∞]:

By Theorem 26.5, f is diﬀerentiable in the interval |x| < R and
f ′(x) =

The same theorem shows f ′ is diﬀerentiable for |x| < R and
f ′′(x) =

k=2
k(k −1)akxk−2.
Continuing in this way, we ﬁnd the nth derivative f (n) exists for
|x| < R and
f (n)(x) =

k=n
k(k −1) · · · (k −n + 1)akxk−n.
In particular,
f (n)(0) = n(n −1) · · · (n −n + 1)an = n!an.
This relation even holds for n = 0 if we make the convention f (0) = f
and recall the convention 0! = 1. Since f (k)(0) = k!ak, the original
power series (1) has the form
f(x) =

5. Diﬀerentiation
250
As suggested at the end of §26, we now begin with a function f
and seek a power series for f. The last paragraph shows f should pos-
sess derivatives of all orders at 0, i.e., f ′(0), f ′′(0), f ′′′(0), . . . should
all exist. For such f, formula (2) might hold for some R > 0, in which
case we have found a power series for f.
One can consider Taylor series that are not centered at 0, just as
we did with the power series in Example 7 on 190.
31.2 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a function deﬁned on some open interval containing c. If f
possesses derivatives of all orders at c, then the series
∞

k=0
f (k)(c)
k!
(x −c)k
(1)
is called the Taylor series for f about c. For n ≥1, remainder Rn(x)
is deﬁned by
Rn(x) = f(x) −
n−1

k=0
f (k)(c)
k!
(x −c)k.
(2)
Of course the remainder Rn depends on f and c, so a more ac-
curate notation would be something like Rn(f; c; x). The remainder
is important because, for any x,
f(x) =
∞

k=0
f (k)(c)
k!
(x −c)k
if and only if
lim
n→∞Rn(x) = 0.
We will show in Example 3 that f need not be given by its Taylor
series, i.e., that limn→∞Rn(x) = 0 can fail. Since we want to know
when f is given by its Taylor series, our various versions of Taylor’s
Theorem all concern the nature of the remainder Rn.
31.3 Taylor’s Theorem.
Let f be deﬁned on (a, b) where a < c < b; here we allow a = −∞
or b = ∞. Suppose the nth derivative f (n) exists on (a, b). Then for
each x ̸= c in (a, b) there is some y between c and x such that
Rn(x) = f (n)(y)
n!
(x −c)n.

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 251
The proof we give is due to James Wolfe1 [71]; compare
Exercise 31.6.
Proof
Fix x ̸= c and n ≥1. Let M be the unique solution of
f(x) =
n−1

k=0
f (k)(c)
k!
(x −c)k + M(x −c)n
n!
(1)
and observe we need only show
f (n)(y) = M
for some
y
between
c
and
x.
(2)
[To see this, replace M by f (n)(y) in Eq. (1) and recall the deﬁnition
of Rn(x).] To prove (2), consider the diﬀerence
g(t) =
n−1

k=0
f (k)(c)
k!
(t −c)k + M(t −c)n
n!
−f(t).
(3)
A direct calculation shows g(c) = 0 and g(k)(c) = 0 for k < n. Also
g(x) = 0 by the choice of M in (1). By Rolle’s theorem 29.2 we
have g′(x1) = 0 for some x1 between c and x. Since g′(c) = 0, a
second application of Rolle’s theorem shows g′′(x2) = 0 for some x2
between c and x1. Again, since g′′(c) = 0 we have g′′′(x3) = 0 for
some x3 between c and x2. This process continues until we obtain xn
between c and xn−1 such that g(n)(xn) = 0. From (3) it follows that
g(n)(t) = M −f (n)(t) for all t ∈(a, b), so (2) holds with y = xn.
31.4 Corollary.
Let f be deﬁned on (a, b) where a < c < b. If all the derivatives f (n)
exist on (a, b) and are bounded by a single constant C, then
lim
n→∞Rn(x) = 0
for all
x ∈(a, b).
Proof
Consider x in (a, b). From Theorem 31.3 we see
|Rn(x)| ≤C
n!|x −c|n
for all
n.

5. Diﬀerentiation
252
Since limn→∞
|x−c|n
n!
= 0 by Exercise 9.15, we conclude limn→∞
Rn(x) = 0.
Example 1
We assume the familiar diﬀerentiation properties of ex, sin x, etc.
(a) Let f(x) = ex for x ∈R. Then f (n)(x) = ex for all n =
0, 1, 2, . . ., so f (n)(0) = 1 for all n. The Taylor series for ex
about 0 is
∞

k=0
1
k!xk.
For any bounded interval (−M, M) in R all the derivatives of
f are bounded [by eM, in fact], so Corollary 31.4 shows
ex =
∞

k=0
1
k!xk
for all
x ∈R.
(b) If f(x) = sin x for x ∈R, then
f (n)(x) =

The derivatives of f are all bounded by 1, so

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 253
Example 2
In Example 2 of §26 we used Abel’s theorem to prove
loge 2 = 1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + 1
5 −1
6 + 1
7 −· · · .
(1)
Here is another proof, based on Taylor’s Theorem. Let f(x) =
loge(1 + x) for x ∈(−1, ∞). Diﬀerentiating, we ﬁnd
f ′(x) = (1 + x)−1,
f ′′(x) = −(1 + x)−2,
f ′′′(x) = 2(1 + x)−3,
etc. A simple induction argument shows
f (n)(x) = (−1)n+1(n −1)!(1 + x)−n
for
n ≥1.
(2)
In particular, f (n)(0) = (−1)n+1(n −1)!, so the Taylor series for f
about 0 is
∞

k=1
(−1)k+1
k
xk = x −x2
2 + x3
3 −x4
4 + x5
5 −· · · .
We also could have obtained this Taylor series using Example 1 in
§26, but we need formula (2) anyway. We now apply Theorem 31.3
with a = −1, b = +∞, c = 0 and x = 1. Thus for each n there exists
yn ∈(0, 1) such that Rn(1) = f(n)(yn)
n!
. Equation (2) shows
Rn(1) = (−1)n+1(n −1)!
(1 + yn)nn!
;
hence
|Rn(1)| =
1
(1 + yn)nn < 1
n
for all
n.
Therefore limn→∞Rn(1) = 0, so the Taylor series for f, evaluated
at x = 1, converges to f(1) = loge 2, i.e., (1) holds.
The next version of Taylor’s theorem gives the remainder in inte-
gral form. The proof uses results from integration theory that should
be familiar from calculus; they also appear in the next chapter.
31.5 Taylor’s Theorem.
Let f be deﬁned on (a, b) where a < c < b, and suppose the nth
derivative f (n) exists and is continuous on (a, b). Then for x ∈(a, b)

we have
Rn(x) =
 x
c
(x −t)n−1
(n −1)! f (n)(t) dt.
(1)
Proof
For n = 1, Eq. (1) asserts
R1(x) = f(x) −f(c) =
 x
c
f ′(t) dt;
this holds by Theorem 34.1. For n ≥2, we repeatedly apply
integration by parts, i.e., we use mathematical induction. So, as-
sume (1) above holds for some n, n ≥1. We evaluate the integral in
(1) by Theorem 34.2, using u(t) = f (n)(t), v′(t) = (x−t)n−1
(n−1)! , so that
u′(t) = f (n+1)(t) and v(t) = −(x−t)n
n!
. We obtain Rn(x)
= u(x)v(x) −u(c)v(c) −

(2)
The deﬁnition of Rn+1 in Deﬁnition 31.2 shows
Rn+1(x) = Rn(x) −f (n)(c)
n!
(x −c)n;
(3)
hence from (2) we see that (1) holds for n + 1.
31.6 Corollary.
If f is as in Theorem 31.5, then for each x in (a, b) diﬀerent from c
there is some y between c and x such that
Rn(x) = (x −c) · (x −y)n−1
(n −1)! f (n)(y).
(1)
This form of Rn is known as Cauchy’s form of the remainder.
Proof
We suppose x < c, the case x > c being similar. The Intermediate

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 255
for some y in (x, c). Since the integral in (2) equals −Rn(x) by
Theorem 31.5, formula (1) holds.
Recall that, for a nonnegative integer n, the binomial theorem

This result holds for some values of x even if the exponent n is not
an integer, provided we allow the series to be an inﬁnite series.
We next prove this using Corollary 31.6. Our proof is motivated
by that in [55].

. If α is a nonnegative
integer, then ak = 0 for k > α and (1) holds for all x as noted in
our discussion prior to this theorem. Henceforth we assume α is not
a nonnegative integer so that ak ̸= 0 for all k. Since

5. Diﬀerentiation
256
the series in (1) has radius of convergence 1; see Theorem 23.1 and
Corollary 12.3. Lemma 26.3 shows the series  kakxk−1 also has
radius of convergence 1, so it converges for |x| < 1. Hence
lim
n→∞nanxn−1 = 0
for
|x| < 1.
(2)
Let f(x) = (1 + x)α for |x| < 1. For n = 1, 2, . . ., we have
f (n)(x) = α(α −1) · · · (α −n + 1)(1 + x)α−n = n!an(1 + x)α−n.
Thus f (n)(0) = n!an for all n ≥1, and the series in (1) is the Taylor
series for f.
For the remainder of this proof, x is a ﬁxed number satisfying
|x| < 1. By Corollary 31.6, with c = 0, for each n, there is yn
between 0 and x such that
Rn(x) = x · (x −yn)n−1
(n −1)!
f (n)(yn) = x · (x −yn)n−1
(n −1)!
n!an(1 + yn)α−n.
So
|Rn(x)| ≤|x|

x −yn
1 + yn

n−1
n|an|(1 + yn)α−1.
(3)
We easily show that

x −y
1 + y
 ≤|x|
if
y
is between
0

x;
indeed, note y = xz for some z ∈[0, 1], so

x −y
1 + y
 =

x −xz
1 + xz
 = |x| ·

1 −z
1 + xz
 ≤|x|
since 1 + xz ≥1 −z. Therefore, (3) implies
|Rn(x)| ≤|x|nn|an|(1 + yn)α−1.
The sequence (1 + yn)α−1 is bounded, because the continuous func-
tion y →(1 + y)α−1 is bounded on [−|x|, |x|], so from (2) and
Exercise 8.4, we conclude limn Rn(x) = 0, so that (1) holds.
We next give an example of a function f whose Taylor series ex-
ists but does not represent the function. The function f is inﬁnitely
diﬀerentiable on R, i.e., derivatives of all order exist at all points

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 257
FIGURE 31.1
of R. The example may appear artiﬁcial, but the existence of such
functions [see also Exercise 31.4] is vital to the theory of distribu-
tions, an important theory related to work in diﬀerential equations
and Fourier analysis.
Example 3
Let f(x) = e−1/x for x > 0 and f(x) = 0 for x ≤0; see Fig. 31.1.
Clearly f has derivatives of all orders at all x ̸= 0. We will prove
f (n)(0) = 0
for
n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(1)
Hence the Taylor series for f is identically zero, so f does not agree
with its Taylor series in any open interval containing 0. First we show
for each n there is a polynomial pn of degree 2n such that
f (n)(x) = e−1/xpn(1/x)
for
x > 0.
(2)
This is obvious for n = 0; simply set p0(t) = 1 for all t. And this is
easy for n = 1 and n = 2; the reader should check (2) holds with
n = 1 and p1(t) = t2 and (2) holds with n = 2 and p2(t) = t4 −2t3.
To apply induction, we assume the result is true for n and write
pn(t) = a0 + a1t + a2t2 + · · · + a2nt2n
where
a2n ̸= 0.
Then for x > 0 we have
f (n)(x) = e−1/x

Theorem 20.10 it suﬃces to verify
lim

xf (n)(x) = 0.
In view of (2), it suﬃces to show

and this can be veriﬁed via k applications of L’Hospital’s Rule 30.2.
As we observed in Remark 2.4 on page 12, Newton’s method
allows one to solve some equations of the form f(x) = 0.

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 259
FIGURE 31.2
31.8 Newton’s Method.
Newton’s method for ﬁnding an approximate solution to f(x) = 0 is
to begin with a reasonable initial guess x0 and then compute
xn = xn−1 −f(xn−1)
f ′(xn−1)
for
n ≥1.
Here xn
is chosen so that (xn, 0) lies on the line through
(xn−1, f(xn−1)) having slope f ′(xn−1). See Fig. 31.2. Often the
sequence (xn) converges rapidly to a solution of f(x) = 0.
31.9 Secant Method.
A similar approach to approximating solutions of f(x) = 0 is to start
with two reasonable guesses x0 and x1 and then compute
xn = xn−1 −f(xn−1)(xn−2 −xn−1)
f(xn−2) −f(xn−1)
for
n ≥2.
Here xn
is chosen so that (xn, 0) lies on the line through
(xn−1, f(xn−1)) and (xn−2, f(xn−2)). See Fig. 31.3.

secant method
Example 4
Consider the equation x10 + x −1 = 0. Let f(x) = x10 + x −1.
The equation f(x) = 0 will have at least two solutions, because
f(0) = −1 and limx→∞f(x) = limx→−∞f(x) = +∞. In fact, it
has exactly two solutions, because f ′(x) = 10x9 + 1 is 0 at only one
point, y = −1/
9√
10 ≈−0.774, so that f decreases on (−∞, y) and
increases on (y, ∞).
We will illustrate both approximation methods, starting with
Newton’s method. Since f(0) = −1 and f(1) = 1. a good initial
guess for one of the solutions would be x0 = 1. We omit the cal-
culations, which we did on the spreadsheet Excel. With x0 = 1 and
Newton’s method, we obtained x1 ≈0.909090909, x2 ≈0.852873482,
x3 ≈0.836193375, x4 ≈0.835083481 and x5 ≈0.835079043. All sub-
sequent approximations equaled x5’s, so this is surely the value to
9-place accuracy.
Since f(−1) = −1, the other solution is less than −1, and
since f(−2) = 1,021, a good initial guess would be close to −1.
But we started at x0 = −2 to see what happens. We obtained
x1 ≈−1.800546982, x2 ≈−1.621810423, x3 ≈−1.462802078,
x4 ≈−1.324100397, x5 ≈−1.209349769, x6 ≈−1.126853632,
x7 ≈−1.085350048, x8 ≈−1.076156798, x9 ≈−1.075766739, and
x10 ≈−1.075766066. All further values of xn approximated x10. Of

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 261
course, x0 = −2 was a poor choice, and x0 = −1.2 would have been
more sensible. With this choice, x5 ≈−1.075766066.
As we will see, with the secant method the convergence is a bit
slower. To ﬁnd the positive solution, we started with x0 = 2 and
x1 = 1. We obtained x9 ≈0.835079043, so it took about twice as
many iterations to get 9-place accuracy as with Newton’s method.
For the other solution, we started with x0 = −2 and x1 = −1, and
we obtained 9-place accuracy at x8 ≈−1.075766066. If you look
at a graph, you will see why choosing guesses on each side of the
true solution can be eﬃcient. If we had started with x0 = −2 and
x1 = −1.5, we would not have reach 9-place accuracy until x12.
Unlike much of calculus, there isn’t a single easily-found and
easily-applied theorem justifying the use of either of these methods.
We’ll prove two such theorems, Theorems 31.12 and 31.13. They
might be of value when studying the theory or when writing a pro-
gram to implement a method. But for simple problems, it is much
more eﬃcient to simply assume and hope that the method will suc-
ceed, and then use common sense to assess whether the method
worked.
The secant method predates Newton’s method, but it does not
seem as well known. In fact, the secant method is an example of
the regula falsi (false position) method for approximating solutions
of equations, which even appears in the Phind Papyrus attributed
to the scribe Ahmes. It works in many examples, but a computer
implementation would need to avoid a premature attempt to divide
by 0. One advantage to this method is that the derivatives of f
might be very complicated or not even exist. Another advantage to
this method is that it can be used to ﬁnd approximate solutions
of equations, like cos x −x = 0, when studying functions in alge-
bra or trigonometry. The methodology also might be useful when
motivating the sequential deﬁnition of the derivative.
We now work toward a theorem providing hypotheses that assure
us that Newton’s method works. We will need a technical lemma
about sequences.

31.10 Lemma.
Let (an) be a sequence of nonnegative numbers, and let C and δ be
positive numbers satisfying Cδ < 1.
(a) If a0 ≤δ and an ≤Ca2
n−1 for n ≥1, then
an ≤(Cδ)2n−1a0
for all
n ≥0.
(b) If max{a0, a1} ≤δ and an ≤C max{an−1, an−2}2 for n ≥2,
then
max{a2n, a2n+1} ≤(Cδ)2n−1 max{a0, a1}
for all
n ≥0.
Proof
We prove (a) by mathematical induction, noting ﬁrst that it is
obvious for n = 0 and that a1 ≤Ca2
0 ≤Cδa0. In general, if
an ≤(Cδ)2n−1a0, then
an+1 ≤Ca2
n ≤C[(Cδ)2n−1a0]2 ≤C2n+1−1δ2n+1−2δa0 = (Cδ)2n+1−1a0.
For (b), we write M = max{a0, a1}, so that M ≤δ and we need
to show
max{a2n, a2n+1} ≤(Cδ)2n−1M
for all
n ≥0.
This is trivial for n = 0. In general, if we have max{a2n, a2n+1} ≤
(Cδ)2n−1M, then
a2n+2 ≤C max{a2n+1, a2n}2 ≤C[(Cδ)2n−1M]2
= C2n+1−1δ2n+1−2M 2 ≤C2n+1−1δ2n+1−2δM = (Cδ)2n+1−1M,
and
a2n+3 ≤C max{a2n+2, a2n+1}2 ≤C max{(Cδ)2n+1−1M, (Cδ)2n−1M}2
≤C[(Cδ)2n−1M]2 = C2n+1−1δ2n+1−2M 2 ≤C2n+1−1δ2n+1−2δM = (Cδ)2n+1−1M.
Thus max{a2n+2, a2n+3} ≤(Cδ)2n+1−1M, and the induction proof
of (b) is complete.

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 263
31.11 Discussion.
We assume f is deﬁned and diﬀerentiable on an open interval J =
(c, d). A glance at the deﬁnition
xn = xn−1 −f(xn−1)
f ′(xn−1)
suggests it is reasonable to assume |f ′| is bounded away from 0 on J.
This implies f ′ is always positive or always negative [Intermediate
Value Theorem for Derivatives 29.8 on page 236]. Therefore f is
strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on J, and f is one-to-one
[Corollary 29.7]. In addition, we assume f ′′ exists on J and |f ′′| is
bounded above.
Suppose there exists δ0 > 0 with the property that f(x) = 0 for
some x in the closed interval I = [c + δ0, d −δ0] ⊂J. We will show
that if the initial value x0 of Newton’s sequence is suﬃciently close
to x, then the iterates xn in Newton’s method converge to x. To
see how this goes, we assume for now that each xn is indeed in the
interval J. From the deﬁnition, we have
xn −x = xn−1 −x −f(xn−1)
f ′(xn−1) = f ′(xn−1) · (xn−1 −x) −f(xn−1)
f ′(xn−1)
.
By Taylor’s Theorem 31.3 on page 250, with n = 2, c = xn−1 and
x = x, we obtain
0 = f(x) = f(xn−1) + f ′xn−1) · (x −xn−1) + 1
2f ′′(yn) · (x −xn−1)2
for some yn between xn−1 and x. Hence
f ′(xn−1) · (xn−1 −x) −f(xn−1) = 1
2f ′′(yn) · (x −xn−1)2,
so
xn −x =
f ′′(yn)
2f ′(xn−1)(xn−1 −x)2.
Therefore
|xn −x| ≤sup{|f ′′(x)| : x ∈J}
2 inf{|f ′(x)| : x ∈J}|xn−1 −x|2,
so that
|xn −x| ≤C|xn−1 −x|2,

5. Diﬀerentiation
264
where C =
sup{|f′′(x)|:x∈J}
2 inf{|f′(x)|:x∈J}. Now select δ > 0 so that Cδ < 1. By
Lemma 31.10(a), with an = |xn −x|, we could conclude
|xn −x| ≤(Cδ)2n−1|x0 −x|
for all
n ≥0,
(1)
if we could arrange for |x0 −x| = a0 ≤δ.
The inequalities (1) are our goal, and would assure us the
sequence (xn) converges to x, but we need to backtrack and de-
termine how to be sure each xn is in the interval J, as well as
arrange for |x0 −x| ≤δ. In addition to requiring Cδ < 1, we
will need to choose δ so that 2δ ≤δ0. Finally, we select x0 in
I so that |f(x0)| < mδ where m = inf{|f ′(x)| : x ∈J}. Note
(x0 −2δ, x0 + 2δ) ⊆(x0 −δ0, x0 + δ0) ⊆J. We also have
|x0 −x| < δ,
(2)
because by the Mean Value Theorem 29.3, there is y0 between x0
and x such that
|x0 −x| = |f(x0) −f(x)|
|f ′(y0)|
= |f(x0)|
|f ′(y0)| ≤|f(x0)|
m
< δ.
By (1) and (2), for each n, we have |xn −x| ≤|x0 −x| < δ; thus
|xn−x0| ≤|xn−x|+|x−x0| < 2δ, so that each xn is in the interval J.
We summarize what we have.
31.12 Theorem.
Consider a function f having a zero x on an interval J = (c, d), and
assume f ′′ exists on J. Assume |f ′′| is bounded above on J and |f ′|
is bounded away from 0 on J. Choose δ0 > 0 so that I = [c + δ0,
d −δ0] ⊂J is a nondegenerate interval containing x and so that
[c + δ0, d −δ0] ⊆J. Let
C = sup{|f ′′(x)| : x ∈J}
2 inf{|f ′(x)| : x ∈J},
and select δ > 0 so that 2δ ≤δ0 and Cδ < 1. Let m = inf{|f ′(x)| :
x ∈J}. Consider any x0 in I satisfying |f(x0)| < mδ. Then the
sequence of iterates given by Newton’s method,
xn = xn−1 −f(xn−1)
f ′(xn−1)
for
n ≥1,

§31. Taylor’s Theorem 265
is a well-deﬁned sequence and converges to x. Also,
|xn −x| ≤C|xn−1 −x|2
for
n ≥1,
and
(1)
|xn −x| ≤(Cδ)2n−1|x0 −x|
for
n ≥0.
(2)
In view of (1), the convergence of (xn) is said to be “quadratic
convergence.” Here is an analogous theorem for the secant method.
Comparing its conclusion with that in Theorem 31.12, it appears
that it will take about twice as many iterations using the secant
method to get the same accuracy as using Newton’s method. This is
what happened in Example 4 on page 260.
31.13 Theorem.
Notation and hypotheses are as in Theorem 31.12, except we set
C = 3 sup{|f ′′(x)| : x ∈J}
2 inf{|f ′(x)| : x ∈J} ,
and we consider distinct x0 and x1 in I satisfying
max{|f(x0)|, |f(x1)|} < mδ.
(1)
As before δ > 0 is chosen so the 2δ ≤δ0 and Cδ < 1.
The sequence (xn) of iterates given by the secant method,
xn = xn−1 −f(xn−1)(xn−2 −xn−1)
f(xn−2) −f(xn−1)
for
n ≥2,
(2)
is well deﬁned and converges to x. Also,
|xn −x| ≤C · max{|xn−1 −x|, |xn−2 −x|}2
for all
n ≥2,
(3)
and for n ≥0, we have
max{|x2n −x|, |x2n+1 −x|} ≤(Cδ)2n−1 max{|x0 −x|, |x1 −x|}. (4)
Proof
As in Discussion 31.11, (1) implies
max{|x0 −x|, |x1 −x|} < δ.
(5)
Since
xn −x = xn−1 −x −f(xn−1)(xn−2 −xn−1)
f(xn−2) −f(xn−1)
for
n ≥2,

5. Diﬀerentiation
266
the Mean Value Theorem shows there is wn between xn−1 and xn−2
so that
xn −x = xn−1 −x −f(xn−1)
f ′(wn) .
By Taylor’s Theorem 31.3 on page 250, with n = 2, c = x and
x = xn−1, we have
f(xn−1) = f(x) + f ′(x) · (xn−1 −x) + 1
2f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)2
= f ′(x) · (xn−1 −x) + 1
2f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)2
for some yn between xn−1 and x. Hence
xn −x = (xn−1 −x) −f ′(x) · (xn−1 −x) + f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)2/2
f ′(wn)
= (xn−1 −x)f ′(wn) −f ′(x) · (xn−1 −x) −f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)2/2
f ′(wn)
= xn−1 −x
f ′(wn)

[f ′(wn) −f ′(x)] −f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)

By the Mean Value Theorem, applied to f ′, we obtain


f ′′(zn) · (wn −x) −f ′′(yn) · (xn−1 −x)


(6)
for some zn between wn and x.
In general, a < c < b implies |c−x| ≤max{|a−x|, |b−x|} for all
x in R [Exercise 31.12]. Applying this, with a = min{xn−1, xn−2},
b = max{xn−1, xn−2}, c = wn and x = x, we obtain
|wn −x| ≤max{|xn−1 −x|, |xn−2 −x|}.
Using this and (6), above we conclude
|xn −x| ≤3
2
sup{f ′′(x) : x ∈J}
inf{f ′(x) : x ∈J} max{|xn−1 −x|, |xn−2 −x|}2,
so that (3) holds. Substituting an = |xn −x| into (3) and (5), we see
that Lemma 31.10(b) implies the inequalities in (4). Inequalities (4)
and (5) imply |xn −x0| < 2δ for all n, so each xn is in J, as needed
for the preceding argument. This completes the proof.

Integration
This chapter serves two purposes. It contains a careful development
of the Riemann integral, which is the integral studied in standard
calculus courses. It also contains an introduction to a generalization
of the Riemann integral called the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. The
generalization is easy and natural. Moreover, the Riemann-Stieltjes
integral is an important tool in probability and statistics, and other
areas of mathematics.
§32
The Riemann Integral
The theory of the Riemann integral is no more diﬃcult than several
other topics dealt with in this book. The one drawback is that it
involves some technical notation and terminology.
32.1 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a bounded function on a closed interval [a, b].1 For S ⊆[a, b],
we adopt the notation
1Here and elsewhere in this chapter, we assume a < b.

M(f, S) = sup{f(x) : x ∈S}
and
m(f, S) = inf{f(x) : x ∈S}.
A partition of [a, b] is any ﬁnite ordered subset P having the form
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}.
The upper Darboux sum U(f, P) of f with respect to P is the sum
U(f, P) =

M(f, [tk−1, tk]) · (tk −tk−1)
and the lower Darboux sum L(f, P) is

Note

M(f, [a, b]) · (tk −tk−1) = M(f, [a, b]) · (b −a);
likewise L(f, P) ≥m(f, [a, b]) · (b −a), so
m(f, [a, b]) · (b −a) ≤L(f, P) ≤U(f, P) ≤M(f, [a, b]) · (b −a). (1)
The upper Darboux integral U(f) of f over [a, b] is deﬁned by
U(f) = inf{U(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}
and the lower Darboux integral is
L(f) = sup{L(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}.
In view of (1), U(f) and L(f) are real numbers.
We will prove in Theorem 32.4 that L(f) ≤U(f). This is not
obvious from (1). [Why?] We say f is integrable on [a, b] provided
L(f) = U(f). In this case, we write
 b
a f or
 b
a f(x) dx for this
common value:

f(x) dx = L(f) = U(f).

Specialists call this integral the Darboux integral. Riemann’s def-
inition of the integral is a little diﬀerent [Deﬁnition 32.8], but we will
show in Theorem 32.9 that the deﬁnitions are equivalent. For this

reason, we will follow customary usage and call the integral deﬁned
above the Riemann integral.
For nonnegative functions,
 b
a f is interpreted as the area of the
region under the graph of f [see Fig. 32.1] for the following reason.
Each lower Darboux sum represents the area of a union of rectangles
inside the region, and each upper Darboux sum represents the area of
a union of rectangles that contains the region. Moreover,
 b
a f is the
unique number that is larger than or equal to all lower Darboux sums
and smaller than or equal to all upper Darboux sums. Figure 19.2
on page 145 illustrates the situation for [a, b] = [0, 1] and
P =

.
Example 1
The simplest function whose integral is not obvious is f(x) = x2.
Consider f on the interval [0, b] where b > 0. For a partition
P = {0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b},
we have
U(f, P) =

Of course, any calculus student could have calculated this inte-
gral using a formula that is based on the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus; see Example 1 in §34.
Example 2
Consider the interval [a, b], where a < b, and let f(x) = 1 for rational
x in [a, b], and let f(x) = 0 for irrational x in [a, b]. For any partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b},
we have

M(f, [tk−1, tk])·(tk −tk−1) =

0 · (tk −tk−1) = 0.
It follows that U(f) = b −a and L(f) = 0. The upper and lower
Darboux integrals for f do not agree, so f is not integrable!
We next develop some properties of the integral.

§32.
The Riemann Integral 273
32.2 Lemma.
Let f be a bounded function on [a, b]. If P and Q are partitions of
[a, b] and P ⊆Q, then
L(f, P) ≤L(f, Q) ≤U(f, Q) ≤U(f, P).
(1)
Proof
The middle inequality is obvious. The proofs of the ﬁrst and third
inequalities are similar, so we will prove
L(f, P) ≤L(f, Q).
(2)
An induction argument [Exercise 32.4] shows we may assume
Q has only one more point, say u, than P. If
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b},
then
Q = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tk−1 < u < tk < · · · < tn = b}
for some k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. The lower Darboux sums for P and Q
are the same except for the terms involving tk−1 or tk. In fact, their
diﬀerence is
L(f, Q) −L(f, P) = m(f, [tk−1, u]) · (u −tk−1) + m(f, [u, tk]) · (tk −u)
−m(f, [tk−1, tk]) · (tk −tk−1).
(3)
To establish (2) it suﬃces to show this quantity is nonnegative. Using
Exercise 4.7(a), we see
m(f, [tk−1, tk]) · (tk −tk−1)
= m(f, [tk−1, tk]) · {(tk −u) + (u −tk−1)}
≤m(f, [u, tk]) · (tk −u) + m(f, [tk−1, u]) · (u −tk−1).
32.3 Lemma.
If f is a bounded function on [a, b], and if P and Q are partitions of
[a, b], then L(f, P) ≤U(f, Q).
Proof
The set P ∪Q is also a partition of [a, b]. Since P ⊆P ∪Q and
Q ⊆P ∪Q, we can apply Lemma 32.2 to obtain
L(f, P) ≤L(f, P ∪Q) ≤U(f, P ∪Q) ≤U(f, Q).

6. Integration
274
32.4 Theorem.
If f is a bounded function on [a, b], then L(f) ≤U(f).
Proof
Fix a partition P of [a, b]. Lemma 32.3 shows L(f, P) is a lower
bound for the set
{U(f, Q) : Q is a partition of [a, b]}.
Therefore L(f, P) is less than or equal to the greatest lower bound
[inﬁmum!] of this set. That is
L(f, P) ≤U(f).
(1)
Now (1) shows that U(f) is an upper bound for the set
{L(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]},
so U(f) ≥L(f).
Note that Theorem 32.4 also follows from Lemma 32.3 and Ex-
ercise 4.8; see Exercise 32.5. The next theorem gives a “Cauchy
criterion” for integrability.
32.5 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is integrable if and only if for each
ϵ > 0 there exists a partition P of [a, b] such that
U(f, P) −L(f, P) < ϵ.
(1)
Proof
Suppose ﬁrst that f is integrable and consider ϵ > 0. There exist
partitions P1 and P2 of [a, b] satisfying
L(f, P1) > L(f) −ϵ
2
and
U(f, P2) < U(f) + ϵ
2.
For P = P1 ∪P2, we apply Lemma 32.2 to obtain
U(f, P) −L(f, P) ≤U(f, P2) −L(f, P1)
< U(f) + ϵ
2 −
	
L(f) −ϵ
2

= U(f) −L(f) + ϵ.
Since f is integrable, U(f) = L(f), so (1) holds.

§32.
The Riemann Integral 275
Conversely, suppose for ϵ > 0 the inequality (1) holds for some
partition P. Then we have
U(f) ≤U(f, P) = U(f, P) −L(f, P) + L(f, P)
< ϵ + L(f, P) ≤ϵ + L(f).
Since ϵ is arbitrary, we conclude U(f) ≤L(f). Hence we have U(f) =
L(f) by Theorem 32.4, i.e., f is integrable.
The remainder of this section is devoted to establishing the
equivalence of Riemann’s and Darboux’s deﬁnitions of integrabil-
ity. Subsequent sections will depend only on items Deﬁnition 32.1
through Theorem 32.5. Therefore the reader who is content with the
Darboux integral in Deﬁnition 32.1 can safely proceed directly to the
next section.
32.6 Deﬁnition.
The mesh of a partition P is the maximum length of the subintervals
comprising P. Thus if
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b},
then
mesh(P) = max{tk −tk−1 : k = 1, 2, . . . , n}.
Here is another “Cauchy criterion” for integrability.
32.7 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is integrable if and only if for each
ϵ > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
mesh(P) < δ
implies
U(f, P) −L(f, P) < ϵ
(1)
for all partitions P of [a, b].
Proof
The ϵ–δ condition in (1) implies integrability by Theorem 32.5.
Conversely, suppose f is integrable on [a, b]. Let ϵ > 0 and select
a partition
P0 = {a = u0 < u1 < · · · < um = b}

6. Integration
276
of [a, b] such that
U(f, P0) −L(f, P0) < ϵ
2.
(2)
Since f is bounded, there exists B > 0 such that |f(x)| ≤B for all
x ∈[a, b]. Let δ =
ϵ
8mB; m is the number of intervals comprising P0.
To verify (1), we consider any partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}
with mesh(P) < δ. Let Q = P ∪P0. If Q has one more element
than P, then a glance at (3) in the proof of Lemma 32.2 leads us to
L(f, Q) −L(f, P) ≤B · mesh(P) −(−B) · mesh(P) = 2B · mesh(P).
Since Q has at most m elements that are not in P, an induction
argument shows
L(f, Q) −L(f, P) ≤2mB · mesh(P) < 2mBδ = ϵ
4.
By Lemma 32.2 we have L(f, P0) ≤L(f, Q), so
L(f, P0) −L(f, P) < ϵ
4.
Similarly
U(f, P) −U(f, P0) < ϵ
4,
so
U(f, P) −L(f, P) < U(f, P0) −L(f, P0) + ϵ
2.
Now (2) implies U(f, P)−L(f, P) < ϵ and we have veriﬁed (1).
Now we give Riemann’s deﬁnition of integrability.
32.8 Deﬁnition.
Let f be a bounded function on [a, b], and let P = {a = t0 < t1 <
· · · < tn = b} be a partition of [a, b]. A Riemann sum of f associated
with the partition P is a sum of the form
n

k=1
f(xk)(tk −tk−1)

§32.
The Riemann Integral 277
where xk ∈[tk−1, tk] for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. The choice of xk’s is quite
arbitrary, so there are inﬁnitely many Riemann sums associated with
a single function and partition.
The function f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] if there exists a
number r with the following property. For each ϵ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that
|S −r| < ϵ
(1)
for every Riemann sum S of f associated with a partition P having
mesh(P) < δ. The number r is the Riemann integral of f on [a, b]
and will be provisionally written as R
 b
a f.
32.9 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is Riemann integrable if and only if
it is [Darboux] integrable, in which case the values of the integrals
agree.
Proof
Suppose ﬁrst that f is [Darboux] integrable on [a, b] in the sense of
Deﬁnition 32.1. Let ϵ > 0, and let δ > 0 be chosen so that (1) of
Theorem 32.7 holds. We show

associated with a partition P having mesh(P) < δ. Clearly we have
L(f, P) ≤S ≤U(f, P), so (1) follows from the inequalities
U(f, P) < L(f, P) + ϵ ≤L(f) + ϵ =
 b

and
L(f, P) > U(f, P) −ϵ ≥U(f) −ϵ =

This proves (1); hence f is Riemann integrable and

Now suppose f is Riemann integrable in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 32.8, and consider ϵ > 0. Let δ > 0 and r be as given in
Deﬁnition 32.8. Select any partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}
with mesh(P) < δ, and for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, select xk in [tk−1, tk]
so that
f(xk) < m(f, [tk−1, tk]) + ϵ.
The Riemann sum S for this choice of xk’s satisﬁes
S ≤L(f, P) + ϵ(b −a)
as well as
|S −r| < ϵ.
It follows that
L(f) ≥L(f, P) ≥S −ϵ(b −a) > r −ϵ −ϵ(b −a).
Since ϵ is arbitrary, we have L(f) ≥r. A similar argument shows
U(f) ≤r. Since L(f) ≤U(f), we see L(f) = U(f) = r. This shows
f is [Darboux] integrable and

32.10 Corollary.
Let f be a bounded Riemann integrable function on [a, b]. Suppose
(Sn) is a sequence of Riemann sums, with corresponding partitions
Pn, satisfying limn mesh(Pn) = 0. Then the sequence (Sn) converges
to
 b

32.11 Remark.
I recently had occasion to use the following simple observation. If
one ignores the end intervals of the partitions, the “almost Riemann
sums” so obtained still converge to the integral; see [59]. This arose
because the intervals had the form [a, b], but the partition points had
the form k
n. Thus the partition points were nice and equally spaced,
except for the end ones.

§33
Properties of the Riemann Integral
In this section we establish some basic properties of the Riemann
integral and we show many familiar functions, including piece-
wise continuous and piecewise monotonic functions, are Riemann
integrable.
A function is monotonic on an interval if it is either increasing
or decreasing on the interval; see Deﬁnition 29.6.
33.1 Theorem.
Every monotonic function f on [a, b] is integrable.
Proof
We assume f is increasing on [a, b] and leave the decreasing case to
Exercise 33.1. We also assume f(a) < f(b), since otherwise f would
be a constant function. Since f(a) ≤f(x) ≤f(b) for all x ∈[a, b],
f is clearly bounded on [a, b]. In order to apply Theorem 32.5, let
ϵ > 0 and select a partition P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} with
mesh less than
ϵ
f(b)−f(a). Then
U(f, P) −L(f, P) =

§33.

Theorem 32.5 now shows f is integrable.
33.2 Theorem.
Every continuous function f on [a, b] is integrable.
Proof
Again, in order to apply Theorem 32.5, consider ϵ > 0. Since f is
uniformly continuous on [a, b] by Theorem 19.2, there exists δ > 0
such that
x, y ∈[a, b]
and
|x −y| < δ
imply
|f(x) −f(y)| <
ϵ
b −a. (1)
Consider any partition P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} where
max{tk −tk−1 : k = 1, 2, . . . , n} < δ.
Since f assumes its maximum and minimum on each interval
[tk−1, tk] by Theorem 18.1, it follows from (1) above that
M(f, [tk−1, tk]) −m(f, [tk−1, tk]) <
ϵ
b −a
for each k. Therefore we have
U(f, P) −L(f, P) <
n

k=1
ϵ
b −a(tk −tk−1) = ϵ,
and Theorem 32.5 shows f is integrable.
33.3 Theorem.
Let f and g be integrable functions on [a, b], and let c be a real
number. Then

(ii) f + g is integrable and

6. Integration
282
Exercise 33.8 shows fg, max(f, g) and min(f, g) are also inte-
grable, but there are no formulas giving their integrals in terms of
 b
a f and
 b
a g.
Proof
The proof of (i) involves three cases: c > 0, c = −1, and c < 0. Of
course, (i) is obvious for c = 0.
Let c > 0 and consider a partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}
of [a, b]. A simple exercise [Exercise 33.2] shows
M(cf, [tk−1, tk]) = c · M(f, [tk−1, tk])
for all k, so U(cf, P) = c · U(f, P). Another application of the
same exercise shows U(cf) = c · U(f). Similar arguments show
L(cf) = c · L(f). Since f is integrable, we have L(cf) = c·L(f) = c·
U(f) = U(cf). Hence cf is integrable and
 b
a
cf = U(cf) = c · U(f) = c
 b

f,
c > 0.
(1)
Now we deal with the case c = −1. Exercise 5.4 implies
U(−f, P) = −L(f, P) for all partitions P of [a, b]. Hence we have
U(−f) = inf{U(−f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}
= inf{−L(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}
= −sup{L(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]} = −L(f).
Replacing f by −f, we also obtain L(−f) = −U(f). Since f is inte-
grable, U(−f) = −L(f) = −U(f) = L(−f); hence −f is integrable
and

§33.
Properties of the Riemann Integral 283
To prove (ii) we will again use Theorem 32.5. Let ϵ > 0. By
Theorem 32.5 there exist partitions P1 and P2 of [a, b] such that
U(f, P1) −L(f, P1) < ϵ
2
and
U(g, P2) −L(g, P2) < ϵ
2.
Lemma 32.2 shows that if P = P1 ∪P2, then
U(f, P) −L(f, P) < ϵ
2
and
U(g, P) −L(g, P) < ϵ
2.
(3)
For any subset S of [a, b], we have
inf{f(x) + g(x) : x ∈S} ≥inf{f(x) : x ∈S} + inf{g(x) : x ∈S},
i.e., m(f + g, S) ≥m(f, S) + m(g, S). It follows that
L(f + g, P) ≥L(f, P) + L(g, P)
and similarly we have
U(f + g, P) ≤U(f, P) + U(g, P).
Therefore from (3) we obtain
U(f + g, P) −L(f + g, P) < ϵ.
Theorem 32.5 now shows f + g is integrable. Since
 b
a
(f + g) = U(f + g) ≤U(f + g, P) ≤U(f, P) + U(g, P )

(i) By Theorem 33.3, h = g −f is integrable on [a, b]. Since
h(x) ≥0 for all x ∈[a, b], it is clear that L(h, P) ≥0 for

We now show |f| is integrable, a point that was conveniently

M(|f|, S) −m(|f|, S) ≤M(f, S) −m(f, S)
(2)

§33.

by Exercise 33.6. From (2) it follows that
U(|f|, P) −L(|f|, P) ≤U(f, P) −L(f, P)
(3)
for all partitions P of [a, b]. By Theorem 32.5, for each ϵ > 0 there
exists a partition P such that
U(f, P) −L(f, P) < ϵ.
In view of (3), the same remark applies to |f|, so |f| is integrable by
Theorem 32.5.
33.6 Theorem.
Let f be a function deﬁned on [a, b]. If a < c < b and f is integrable

Since f is bounded on both [a, c] and [c, b], f is bounded on [a, b]. In
this proof we will decorate upper and lower sums so that it will be
clear which intervals we are dealing with. Let ϵ > 0. By Theorem 32.5
there exist partitions P1 and P2 of [a, c] and [c, b] such that

a(f, P1) < ϵ

and

The set P = P1 ∪P2 is a partition of [a, b], and it is obvious that

with a similar identity for lower sums. It follows that

Most functions encountered in calculus and analysis are covered
by the next deﬁnition. However, see Exercises 33.10–33.12.
33.7 Deﬁnition.
A function f on [a, b] is piecewise monotonic if there is a partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}
of [a, b] such that f is monotonic on each interval (tk−1, tk). The
function f is piecewise continuous if there is a partition P of [a, b]
such that f is uniformly continuous on each interval (tk−1, tk).
33.8 Theorem.
If f is a piecewise continuous function or a bounded piecewise
monotonic function on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].
Proof
Let P be the partition described in Deﬁnition 33.7. Consider a ﬁxed
interval [tk−1, tk]. If f is piecewise continuous, then its restriction to
(tk−1, tk) can be extended to a continuous function fk on [tk−1, tk]
by Theorem 19.5. If f is piecewise monotonic, then its restriction to
(tk−1, tk) can be extended to a monotonic function fk on [tk−1, tk];
for example, if f is increasing on (tk−1, tk), simply deﬁne
fk(tk) = sup{f(x) : x ∈(tk−1, tk)}
and
fk(tk−1) = inf{f(x) : x ∈(tk−1, tk)}.
In either case, fk is integrable on [tk−1, tk] by Theorem 33.1 or 33.2.
Since f agrees with fk on [tk−1, tk] except possibly at the endpoints,
Exercise 32.7 shows f is also integrable on [tk−1, tk]. Now Theo-
rem 33.6 and a trivial induction argument show f is integrable on
[a, b].
We close this section with a simple but useful result.

all x ∈[a, b]. Otherwise, m < M and by Theorem 18.1, there exist
distinct x0 and y0 in [a, b] satisfying f(x0) = m and f(y0) = M. Since
each function M −f and f −m is nonnegative and not identically 0,

integrals, i.e., when is
lim

(1)
true? By Theorems 24.3 and 25.2, if the fns are continuous and
converge uniformly to f = limn→∞fn on [a, b], then f is continuous
and (1) holds. It turns out that if each fn is just Riemann integrable
and fn →f uniformly, then f is Riemann integrable and (1) holds;
see Exercise 33.9. What happens if fn →f pointwise on [a, b]? One
problem is that f need not be integrable even if it is bounded and
each fn is integrable.
Consider, for example, the non-integrable function f in Exam-
ple 2 on page 272: f(x) = 1 for rational x in [a, b] and f(x) = 0 for
irrational x in [a, b]. Let (xk)k∈N be an enumeration of the rationals
in [a, b], and deﬁne fn(xk) = 1 for 1 ≤k ≤n and fn(x) = 0 for

6. Integration
288
all other x in [a, b]. Then fn →f pointwise on [a, b], and each fn is
integrable.
This example leaves open the possibility that (1) will hold pro-
vided all the functions fn and the limit function f are integrable.
However, Exercise 33.15 provides an example of a sequence (fn) of
functions on [0, 1] converging pointwise to a function f, with all the
functions integrable, and yet (1) does not hold. Nevertheless, there
is an important theorem that does apply to sequences of functions
that converge pointwise.
33.11 Dominated Convergence Theorem.
Suppose (fn) is a sequence of integrable functions on [a, b] and fn →
f pointwise where f is an integrable function on [a, b]. If there exists
an M > 0 such that |fn(x)| ≤M for all n and all x in [a, b], then
lim
n→∞
 b
a
fn(x) dx =
 b
a
lim
n→∞fn(x) dx.
We omit the proof. An elementary proof of the Dominated Con-
vergence Theorem is given by Jonathan W. Lewin [42]. Here is a
corollary.
33.12 Monotone Convergence Theorem.
Suppose (fn) is a sequence of integrable functions on [a, b] such that
f1(x) ≤f2(x) ≤· · · for all x in [a, b]. Suppose also that fn →f
pointwise where f is an integrable function on [a, b]. Then
lim
n→∞
 b
a
fn(x) dx =
 b
a
lim
n→∞fn(x) dx.
This follows from the Dominated Convergence Theorem, because
there exists an M > 0 such that |f1(x)| ≤M and also |f(x)| ≤M
for all x in [a, b]. This implies |fn(x)| ≤M for all n and all x in [a, b],
since −M ≤f1(x) ≤fn(x) ≤M for all x.
Our version of the Dominated Convergence Theorem is a spe-
cial case of a much more general theorem, which is usually stated
and proved for the family of all “Lebesgue integrable functions,”
not just for Riemann integrable functions. There is also a Monotone
Convergence Theorem for Lebesgue integrable functions, but in that

Exercises 289
generality it does not follow immediately from the Dominated Con-
vergence Theorem, because in that setting integrable functions need
not be bounded. An elementary proof of the Monotone Convergence
Theorem is proved for Riemann integrable functions, without resort
to Lebesgue theory, by Brian S. Thomson [67].
Exercises
33.1 Complete the proof of Theorem 33.1 by showing that a decreasing
function on [a, b] is integrable.
33.2 This exercise could have appeared just as easily in §4. Let S be a
nonempty bounded subset of R. For ﬁxed c > 0, let cS = {cs : s ∈S}.

§34
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
There are two versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Each says, roughly speaking, that diﬀerentiation and integration are
inverse operations. In fact, our ﬁrst version [Theorem 34.1] says “the
integral of the derivative of a function is given by the function,”
and our second version [Theorem 34.3] says “the derivative of the
integral of a continuous function is the function.” It is somewhat
traditional for books to prove our second version ﬁrst and use it to
prove our ﬁrst version, although some books do avoid this approach.
F. Cunningham, Jr. [18] oﬀers some good reasons for avoiding the
traditional approach:
(a) Theorem 34.3 implies Theorem 34.1 only for functions g whose
derivative g′ is continuous; see Exercise 34.1.
(b) Making Theorem 34.1 depend on Theorem 34.3 obscures the
fact that the two theorems say diﬀerent things, have diﬀerent
applications, and may leave the impression Theorem 34.3 is the
fundamental theorem.
(c) The need for Theorem 34.1 in calculus is immediate and easily
motivated.
In what follows, we say a function h deﬁned on (a, b) is integrable
on [a, b] if every extension of h to [a, b] is integrable. In view of

6. Integration
292
Exercise 32.7, the value
 b
a h will not depend on the values of the
extensions at a or b.
34.1 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus I.
If g is a continuous function on [a, b] that is diﬀerentiable on (a, b),
and if g′ is integrable on [a, b], then
 b
a
g′ = g(b) −g(a).
(1)
Proof
Let ϵ > 0. By Theorem 32.5, there exists a partition P = {a = t0 <
t1 < · · · < tn = b} of [a, b] such that
U(g′, P) −L(g′, P) < ϵ.
(2)
We apply the Mean Value Theorem 29.3 to each interval [tk−1, tk] to
obtain xk in (tk−1, tk) for which
(tk −tk−1)g′(xk) = g(tk) −g(tk−1).
Hence we have
g(b) −g(a) =
n

k=1
[g(tk) −g(tk−1)] =
n

k=1
g′(xk)(tk −tk−1).
It follows that
L(g′, P) ≤g(b) −g(a) ≤U(g′, P);
(3)
see Deﬁnition 32.1. Since
L(g′, P) ≤
 b
a
g′ ≤U(g′, P),
inequalities (2) and (3) imply

 b
a
g′ −[g(b) −g(a)]
 < ϵ.
Since ϵ is arbitary, (1) holds.
The integration formulas in calculus all rely in the end on
Theorem 34.1.

34.2 Theorem [Integration by Parts].
If u and v are continuous functions on [a, b] that are diﬀerentiable
on (a, b), and if u′ and v′ are integrable on [a, b], then
 b
a
u(x)v′(x) dx +
 b
a
u′(x)v(x) dx = u(b)v(b) −u(a)v(a).
(1)
Proof
Let g = uv; then g′ = uv′+u′v by Theorem 28.3. Exercise 33.8 shows
g′ is integrable. Now Theorem 34.1 shows
 b
a
g′(x) dx = g(b) −g(a) = u(b)v(b) −u(a)v(a),
so (1) holds.
Note the use of Exercise 33.8 above can be avoided if u′ and v′
are continuous, which is normally the case.
Example 2
Here is a simple application of integration by parts. To calculate
 π
0 x cos x dx, we note the integrand has the form u(x)v′(x) where
u(x) = x and v(x) = sin x. Hence

34.3 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II.
Let f be an integrable function on [a, b]. For x in [a, b], let
F(x) =
 x
a
f(t) dt.
Then F is continuous on [a, b]. If f is continuous at x0 in (a, b), then
F is diﬀerentiable at x0 and
F ′(x0) = f(x0).
Proof
Select B > 0 so that |f(x)| ≤B for all x ∈[a, b]. If x, y ∈[a, b] and
|x −y| < ϵ
B where x < y, say, then
|F(y)−F(x)| =

 y

f(t) dt
 ≤
 y

|f(t)| dt ≤
 y

B dt =B(y−x) < ϵ.
This shows F is [uniformly] continuous on [a, b].
Suppose f is continuous at x0 in (a, b). Observe
F(x) −F(x0)
x −x0
=
1
x −x0
 x
x0
f(t) dt
for x ̸= x0. The trick is to observe
f(x0) =

x −x0
 x
x0
f(x0) dt,
and therefore
F(x) −f(x0)
x −x0
−f(x0) =
1
x −x0
 x
x0
[f(t) −f(x0)] dt.
(1)
Let ϵ > 0. Since f is continuous at x0, there exists δ > 0 such that
t ∈(a, b)
and
|t −x0| < δ
imply
|f(t) −f(x0)| < ϵ;

§34.
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 295
see Theorem 17.2. It follows from (1) that

F(x) −F(x0)
x −x0
−f(x0)
 ≤ϵ
for x in (a, b) satisfying |x −x0| < δ; the cases x > x0 and x < x0
require separate arguments. We have just shown
lim
x→x0
F(x) −F(x0)
x −x0
= f(x0).
In other words, F ′(x0) = f(x0).
A useful technique of integration is known as “substitution.” A
more accurate description of the process is “change of variable.” The
technique is the reverse of the chain rule.
34.4 Theorem [Change of Variable].
Let u be a diﬀerentiable function on an open interval J such that u′
is continuous, and let I be an open interval such that u(x) ∈I for
all x ∈J. If f is continuous on I, then f ◦u is continuous on J and
 b
a
f ◦u(x)u′(x) dx =
 u(b)
u(a)
f(u) du
(1)
for a, b in J.
Note u(a) need not be less than u(b), even if a < b.
Proof
The continuity of f ◦u follows from Theorem 17.5. Fix c in I and let
F(u) =
 u
c f(t) dt. Then F ′(u) = f(u) for all u ∈I by Theorem 34.3.
Let g = F ◦u. By the Chain Rule 28.4, we have
g′(x) = F ′(u(x)) · u′(x) = f(u(x)) · u′(x),
so by Theorem 34.1
 b
a
f ◦u(x)u′(x) dx =

g′(x) dx = g(b) −g(a) = F(u(b)) −F(u(a))

 u(b)

 u(a)

f(t) dt =

This proves (1).

Example 3
Let g be a one-to-one diﬀerentiable function on an open interval I.
Then J = g(I) is an open interval, and the inverse function g−1 is

 b
a
g(x) dx +
 g(b)
g(a)
g−1(u) du = b · g(b) −a · g(a)
(1)
for a, b in I.

obtain
 b
a
g−1 ◦g(x)g′(x) dx =

Since g−1 ◦g(x) = x for x in I, we obtain
 g(b)
g(a)
g−1(u) du =

xg′(x) dx.
Now integrate by parts with u(x) = x and v(x) = g(x):

 b

This is formula (1).

§35
* Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals
In this long section we introduce a useful generalization of the Rie-
mann integral. In the Riemann integral, all intervals of the same
length are given the same weight. For example, in our deﬁnition of
upper sums
U(f, P) =
n

k=1
M(f, [tk−1, tk]) · (tk −tk−1),
(*)
the factors (tk −tk−1) are the lengths of the intervals involved. In
applications such as probability and statistics, it is desirable to mod-
ify the deﬁnition so as to weight the intervals according to some
increasing function F. In other words, the idea is to replace the fac-
tors (tk −tk−1) in (*) by [F(tk)−F(tk−1)]. The Riemann integral is,
then, the special case where F(t) = t for all t.
It is also desirable to allow some points to have positive weight.
This corresponds to the situation where F has jumps, i.e., where
the left-hand and right-hand limits of F diﬀer. In fact, if (ck) is a
sequence in R, then the sums
∞

k=1
ckf(uk)
can be viewed as a generalized integral for a suitable F [see Exam-
ples 1 and 3 on pages 301 and 309]. In this case, F has a jump at
each uk.
The traditional treatment, in all books that I am aware of, re-
places the factors (tk −tk−1) in (*) by [F(tk)−F(tk−1)] and develops
the theory from there, though some authors emphasize upper and
lower sums while others stress generalized Riemann sums. In this
section, we oﬀer a slightly diﬀerent treatment, so
Warning. Theorems in this section do not necessarily correspond to
theorems in other texts.
We deviate from tradition because:
(a) Our treatment is more general. Functions that are Riemann-
Stieltjes integrable in the traditional sense are integrable in our
sense [Theorem 35.20].

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 299
(b) In the traditional theory, if f and F have a common discontinu-
ity, then f is not integrable using F. Such unfortunate results
disappear in our approach. We will show piecewise continu-
ous and piecewise monotonic functions are always integrable
using F [Theorem 35.17]. We also will observe that if F is a
step function, then all bounded functions are integrable; see
Example 1.
(c) We will give a deﬁnition involving Riemann-Stieltjes sums that
is equivalent to our deﬁnition involving upper and lower sums
[Theorem 35.25]. The corresponding standard deﬁnitions are
not equivalent.
As just explained, our development of Riemann-Stieltjes integrals
has several positive features. However, this section is long with lots of
technical details. Therefore, we recommend readers omit the proofs
on ﬁrst reading, and then decide whether to go through the details.
Many of the results in this section are straightforward general-
izations of results in §§32 and 33. Accordingly, many proofs will be
brief or omitted.
35.1 Notation.
We assume throughout this section that F is an increasing function
on a closed interval [a, b]. To avoid trivialities we assume F(a) <
F(b). All left-hand and right-hand limits exist; see Deﬁnition 20.3
and Exercise 35.1. We use the notation
F(t−) = lim
x→t−F(x)
and
F(t+) = lim
x→t+ F(x).
For the endpoints we decree
F(a−) = F(a)
and
F(b+) = F(b).
Note that F(t−) ≤F(t+) for all t ∈[a, b]. If F is continuous at t, then
F(t−) = F(t) = F(t+). Otherwise F(t−) < F(t+) and the diﬀerence
F(t+) −F(t−) is called the jump of F at t. The actual value of F(t)
at jumps t will play no role in what follows.
In the next deﬁnition we employ some of the notation established
in Deﬁnition 32.1.

35.2 Deﬁnition.
For a bounded function f on [a, b] and a partition P = {a = t0 <
t1 < · · · < tn = b} of [a, b], we write
JF(f, P) =
n

k=0
f(tk) · [F(t+
k ) −F(t−
k )].
(1)
The upper Darboux-Stieltjes sum is
UF (f, P) = JF(f, P) +
n

k=1
M(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1)] (2)
and the lower Darboux-Stieltjes sum is
LF (f, P) = JF (f, P) +
n

k=1
m(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1)]. (3)
These deﬁnitions explicitly take into account the possible jump
eﬀects of F at the points tk, though F may have jumps at other
points. The other terms focus on the eﬀect of F on the open intervals
(tk−1, tk). Observe
[a, b] =
n
k=0
{tk} ∪
n
k=1
(tk−1, tk)
represents [a, b] as a disjoint union.2 See Remarks 35.26 for a discus-
sion about the choice of open intervals versus closed intervals in the
deﬁnitions of Riemann integrals and Riemann-Stieltjes integrals.
Note
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P)
=
n

k=1
[M(f, (tk−1, tk)) −m(f, (tk−1, tk))][F(t−

and
m(f, [a, b]) · [F(b) −F(a)] ≤LF (f, P) ≤UF (f, P)
≤M(f, [a, b]) · [F(b) −F(a)].

2In measure theory this is an example of a measurable partition, that is to say,
a family of measurable sets with disjoint union [a, b].

(6)
since the last sum is a telescoping sum. The upper Darboux-Stieltjes
integral is
UF (f) = inf{UF (f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}
(7)
and the lower Darboux-Stieltjes integral is
LF (f) = sup{LF (f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]}.
(8)
Theorem 35.5 below states that LF (f) ≤UF (f). Accordingly, we
say f is Darboux-Stieltjes integrable on [a, b] with respect to F or,
more brieﬂy, F-integrable on [a, b], provided LF (f) = UF (f); in this
case we write
 b

for u > a, and let
Ja(t) =

Then Ju is an increasing step function with jump 1 at u. Also, every
bounded function f on [a, b] is Ju-integrable and

P be the partition {a = u1 < u2 < · · · < um = b}. Then we have

UF (f) = LF(f) =

f(uj) · cj.
Hence f is F-integrable and (1) holds.

We specialize Example 1 to the case u1 = 0, u2 = 1, u3 = 2, u4 = 3;
c1 = c4 = 1
8, c2 = c3 = 3

35.3 Lemma.
Let f be a bounded function on [a, b], and let P and Q be partitions
of [a, b] such that P ⊆Q. Then
LF (f, P) ≤LF (f, Q) ≤UF (f, Q) ≤UF (f, P).
(1)
Proof
We imitate the proof of Lemma 32.2 on page 273 down to, but not
including, formula (3). In the present case, the diﬀerence LF (f, Q)−
LF (f, P) equals
f(u) · [F(u+) −F(u−)] + m(f, (tk−1, u)) · [F(u−) −F(t+

−m(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(t−

(3)
and this is nonnegative because
m(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(t−

= m(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(t−

35.4 Lemma.
If f is a bounded function on [a, b] and if P and Q are partitions of

35.5 Theorem.
For every bounded function f on [a, b], we have LF (f) ≤UF (f).

35.6 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is F-integrable if and only if for each
ϵ > 0 there exists a partition P such that
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) < ϵ.
Proof
Imitates the proof of Theorem 32.5 on page 274.
We next develop analogues of results in §33; we return later to
generalizations of items Deﬁnition 32.6 through Theorem 32.9. We
begin with the analogue of Theorem 33.2. The analogue of Theo-
rem 33.1 is true, but its proof requires some preparation, so we defer
it to Theorem 35.16.
35.7 Theorem.
Every continuous function f on [a, b] is F-integrable.
Proof
To apply Theorem 35.6, let ϵ > 0. Since f is uniformly continuous,
there exists δ > 0 such that
x, y ∈[a, b]
and
|x−y| < δ
imply
|f(x)−f(y)| <
ϵ
F(b) −F(a).
Just as in the proof of Theorem 33.2, there is a partition P of [a, b]
such that
M(f, (tk−1, tk)) −m(f, (tk−1, tk)) <
ϵ
F(b) −F(a)

F(b) −F(a)[F(t−

Theorem 35.6 now shows f is F-integrable.
35.8 Theorem.

(ii) f + g is F-integrable and  b

Imitates the proof of Theorem 33.3, using Theorem 35.6 instead of
Theorem 32.5.
35.9 Theorem.
If f and g are F-integrable on [a, b] and if f(x) ≤g(x) for x ∈[a, b],

Imitates the proof of Theorem 33.6. Note that an upper or lower sum
on [a, c] will include the term f(c)[F(c) −F(c−)] while an upper or
lower sum on [c, b] will include the term f(c)[F(c+) −F(c)].
The next result clearly has no analogue in §32 or §33.
35.12 Theorem.
(a) Let F1 and F2 be increasing functions on [a, b]. If f is F1-
integrable and F2-integrable on [a, b] and if c > 0, then f is
cF1-integrable, f is (F1 + F2)-integrable,

(2)
(b) Let (Fj) be a sequence of increasing functions on [a, b] such that
F = ∞
j=1 Fj deﬁnes an (automatically increasing) function on
[a, b]. Thus the series converges on the entire interval [a, b], and
F(a) and F(b) are ﬁnite. If a bounded function f on [a, b] is
Fj-integrable for each j, then f is F-integrable on [a, b] and
 b

(3)
Proof
From Theorem 20.4 we see
(F1 + F2)(t+) = lim
x→t+[F1(x) + F2(x)] = lim
x→t+ F1(x) + lim
x→t+ F2(x)
= F1(t+) + F2(t+)
with similar identities for (F1 + F2)(t−), (cF1)(t+) and (cF1)(t−).
Hence for any partition P of [a, b], we have
UF1+F2(f, P) = UF1(f, P) + UF2(f, P)
LF1+F2(f, P) = LF1(f, P) + LF2(f, P),
(4)

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 307
UcF1(f, P) = cUF1(f, P) and LcF1(f, P) = cLF1(f, P). It is now clear
that f is cF1-integrable and that (1) holds. To check (2), let ϵ > 0.
By Theorem 35.6 and Lemma 35.3, there is a single partition P of
[a, b] so that both
UF1(f, P) −LF1(f, P) < ϵ
2
and
UF2(f, P) −LF2(f, P) < ϵ
2.
Hence by (4) we have
UF1+F2(f, P) −LF1+F2(f, P) < ϵ.
This and Theorem 35.6 imply f is (F1 +F2)-integrable. The identity
(2) follows from
 b
a
f d(F1 + F2) ≤UF1+F2(f, P) < LF1+F2(f, P) + ϵ

Now we prove part (b). We write Sm for m
j=1 Fj and Tm for the
diﬀerence (or tail sum) F −Sm = ∞
j=m+1 Fj. Let B be a positive
bound for |f| on [a, b], and consider ϵ > 0. Select a positive integer
m0 so that
|Tm(b) −Tm(a)| <
ϵ
5B
for
m ≥m0.
(5)
We will show
UF (f) −LF (f) < 3ϵ
5 .
(6)
Since ϵ > 0 is arbitrary, this will imply UF (f) = LF (f), so that f is
F-integrable. We will also show

 b
a
fdF −
 b

(7)
Since ϵ > 0 is arbitrary, and
 b

j=1
 b

will conﬁrm (3).

6. Integration
308
We now prove (6). First we claim
|UF (f, P)−USm(f, P)| < ϵ
5 for all partitions P of [a, b] and m ≥m0,
(8)
|LF (f, P)−LSm(f, P)| < ϵ
5 for all partitions P of [a, b] and m ≥m0.
(9)
Let P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}. Note Tm = ∞
j=m+1 Fj is
an increasing function on [a, b], so using Eq. (2) in Deﬁnition 35.2 on
page 300, the left-hand side of inequality (8) is bounded by
n

k=0
B[Tm(t+
k ) −Tm(t−
k )] +
n

k=1
B[Tm(t−
k ) −Tm(t+
k−1)].
This sum is equal to B[Tm(b+)−Tm(a−)] = B[Tm(b)−Tm(a)] which,
by (5), is less than ϵ
5, so (8) holds. The veriﬁcation of (9) is similar.
In view of (2), f is Sm-integrable for each m, so for each m there
is a partition Pm of [a, b] satisfying
USm(f, Pm) −LSm(f, Pm) < ϵ
5.
(10)
Now we apply the triangle inequality to (8) and (9) [with P = Pm]
and (10) to obtain
UF (f, Pm) −LF (f, Pm) < 3ϵ
5
for
m ≥m0.
(11)
This implies (6); therefore f is F-integrable.
Now (11) and (10) imply
UF (f, Pm) −
 b
a
fdF < 3ϵ

and
USm(f, Pm) −

fdSm < ϵ

i.e., (7) holds.

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 309
Example 3
(a) Let (uj) be a sequence of distinct points in [a, b], and let (cj) be
a sequence of nonnegative numbers3 such that  cj < ∞. Using the
notation of Example 1 on page 301, we deﬁne
F =
∞

j=1
cjJuj.
Then F is an increasing function on [a, b]; note F(a) = 0 and F(b) =
∞
j=1 cj < ∞. Every bounded function f on [a, b] is F-integrable and
 b
a
f dF =


j=1
cjf(uj).
(1)
This follows from Theorem 35.12(b) with Fj = cjJuj, since every
bounded function is Fj-integrable for every j, as shown in Example 1.
(b) The function F in part (a) satisﬁes
F(t) =

{cj : uj ≤t}
for
t ∈(a, b],
(2)
since Juj(t) = 1 if and only if uj ≤t. Also F(a) = 0. Moreover,
F(t−) =

{cj : uj < t}
for
t ∈(a, b],
(3)
since F(t−) = limx→t−{cj : uj ≤x}. We also have
F(t+) = F(t)
for
t ∈(a, b],
(4)
because F(b+) = F(b) by decree, and for t ∈(a, b) and x > t, we
have
F(x) −F(t) =

{cj : t < uj ≤x},
(5)
so that F(t+) = limx→t+ F(x) = F(t). [Details: Given ϵ > 0, there
is N so that ∞
j=N+1 cj < ϵ. For x > t and x suﬃciently close to t,
the sets {uj : t < uj ≤x} and {u1, . . . , uN} are disjoint, so the sum
in (5) is less than ϵ.]
3Allowing some cj’s to be 0 won’t change the value of F, of course, but allowing
cj’s to be 0 is sometimes convenient.

6. Integration
310
(c) A function F is said to be right continuous at t if F(t) =
F(t+). Equation (4) shows F is right continuous except possibly
at a. By (4), (2) and (3), we have
F(t+) −F(t−) =

{cj : uj = t}.
(6)
Equation (6) holds for all t in [a, b], even t = a. Therefore, F is contin-
uous at t unless t = uj for some j. Finally, F is clearly discontinuous
at each uj unless cj = 0.
The next theorem shows F-integrals can often be calculated using
ordinary Riemann integrals. In fact, most F-integrals encountered in
practice are either covered by Example 3 or this theorem.
35.13 Theorem.
Suppose F is diﬀerentiable on [a, b] and F ′ is continuous on [a, b]. If
f is continuous on [a, b], then
 b
a
f dF =
 b

(1)
Proof
Note fF ′ is Riemann integrable by Theorem 33.2, and f is F-
integrable by Theorem 35.7. By Theorems 32.5 and 35.6, there is
a partition P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} such that
U(fF ′, P) −L(fF ′, P) < ϵ
2
and
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) < ϵ
2. (2)
By the Mean Value Theorem 29.3 on page 233 applied to F on each
interval [tk−1, tk], there exist xk in (tk−1, tk) so that
F(tk) −F(tk−1) = F ′(xk)(tk −tk−1);
hence
n

k=1
f(xk) · [F(tk) −F(tk−1)] =
n

k=1
f(xk)F ′(xk) · (tk −tk−1).
(3)
Since F is continuous, it has no jumps and (3) implies
LF (f, P) ≤U(fF ′, P)
and
L(fF ′, P) ≤UF (f, P).

Example 4
Let F(t) = 0 for t < 0, F(t) = t2 for 0 ≤t < 2, and F(t) = t + 5
for t ≥2; see Fig. 35.2. We can write F = F1 + 3J2 where F1 is
continuous and J2 is the jump function at 2. The function F1 is
diﬀerentiable except at t = 2; the diﬀerentiability of F1 at t = 0 is
shown in Exercise 28.7. Let f be continuous on [−3, 3], say. Clearly

For the proof of Lemma 35.15, we will use the next theorem,
which is interesting in its own right.
35.14 Theorem.
Let F be a right-continuous increasing function on [a, b]. Then we
have F = Fc + Fd, where Fc is a continuous increasing function on
[a, b], and Fd =  cjJuj where {u1, u2, . . .} are the jump points of F
and cj is the jump at uj, i.e., cj = F(u+
j ) −F(u−
j ) for each j. (If
there are no jump points, then F is continuous, F = Fc and Fd = 0.)
In general, there might be ﬁnitely many or inﬁnitely many such uj,
so we will not decorate the sums until we need to.
See Examples 1 and 3 on pages 301 and 309 for the notation. The
function Fc is called the “continuous part” of F, and Fd is called the
“discrete part” of F.

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 313
Proof
Let Fc = F −Fd. To show Fc is an increasing function, it suﬃces to
show s < t implies Fc(s) ≤Fc(t), i.e.,
s < t
implies
Fd(t) −Fd(s) ≤F(t) −F(s).
By (2) in Example 3(b) on page 309, it suﬃces to show
s < t
implies

{cj : s < uj ≤t} ≤F(t) −F(s).
(1)
To show this, it suﬃces to consider a ﬁnite subset E of {uj : s <
uj ≤t}, which we write as {t0 < t1 < · · · < tn} where s < t0 and
tn ≤t. Then

{cj : uj ∈E} =
n

k=0
[F(t+
k )−F(t−
k )] ≤F(t+)−F(s) = F(t)−F(s)
by (6) in Deﬁnition 35.2 on page 300 with a = s and b = t. Since E
is an arbitrary ﬁnite subset of {uj : s < uj ≤t}, (1) holds.
To show Fc is continuous, ﬁrst note that if t ̸= uj for all j, then F
is continuous at t, and Fd is continuous at t as shown in Example 3(c).
So Fc = F −Fd is continuous at t in this case. Otherwise, t = uj
for some j. Then F(u+
j ) −F(u−
j ) = cj by the deﬁnition of cj, and
Fd(u+
j ) −Fd(u−
j ) = cj by (6) of Example 3(b). Therefore
Fc(u+
j ) −Fc(u−
j ) = F(u+
j ) −Fd(u+
j ) −F(u−
j ) + Fd(u−
j )
= [F(u+
j ) −F(u−
j )] −[Fd(u+
j ) −Fd(u−
j )] = cj −cj = 0,
so that Fc is continuous at uj, as claimed.
It is easy to check that the representation of F as Fc + Fd is
unique in the following sense: If Fc+Fd = Gc+Gd where G is another
right-continuous increasing function, then Fc = Gc and Fd = Gd.
35.15 Lemma.
If F is an increasing function on [a, b] and if ϵ > 0, then there exists
a partition
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}

6. Integration
314
such that
F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1) < ϵ
for
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(1)
Proof
The conclusion (1) does not depend on the exact values of F at any of
its jump points, though of course they satisfy F(t−) ≤F(t) ≤F(t+).
Hence it suﬃces to prove (1) after F has been redeﬁned at its jump
points. We choose to deﬁne F(t) = F(t+) at all jump points, so that
F is right continuous on [a, b].
Now that F is right continuous, we can apply Theorem 35.14:
F = Fc +  cjJuj where Fc is continuous, each cj is positive, and
 cj < ∞. If F is continuous, then the sum disappears and the proof
below can be simpliﬁed.
Given ϵ > 0, select N so that ∞
j=N+1 cj < ϵ
2. Again, if there are
only ﬁnitely many uj’s, this part of the proof simpliﬁes. Since Fc is
uniformly continuous on [a, b] [by Theorem 19.2 on page 143], there
is δ > 0 so that
|s −t| < δ
implies
|Fc(s) −Fc(t)| < ϵ
2.
(2)
Let P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn} be a partition that includes
{u1, . . . , uN} and satisﬁes |tk −tk−1| < δ for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Let
F1 =
N

j=1
cjJuj
and
F2 =
∞

j=N+1
cjJuj,
so that F = Fc + F1 + F2. For each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have
Fc(t−
k ) −Fc(t+
k−1) = Fc(tk) −Fc(tk−1) < ϵ
2
by (2),
F1(t−
k ) −F1(t+
k−1) = 0
because F1 is constant on the open interval (tk−1, tk), and
F2(t−
k ) −F2(t+
k−1) ≤F2(b) −F2(a) ≤
∞

j=N+1
cj < ϵ
2.
Since F = Fc + F1 + F2, summing yields F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1) < ϵ.
35.16 Theorem.
Every monotonic function f on [a, b] is F-integrable.

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 315
Proof
We may assume f is increasing and f(a) < f(b). Since f(a) ≤f(x) ≤
f(b) for all x in [a, b], f is bounded on [a, b]. For ϵ > 0 we apply
Lemma 35.15 to obtain P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} where
F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1) <
ϵ
f(b) −f(a)
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Since M(f, (tk−1, tk)) = f(t−
k ) ≤f(tk) and
m(f, (tk−1, tk)) = f(t+
k−1) ≥f(tk−1), we have
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) ≤

f(b) −f(a) = ϵ.
Since ϵ is arbitrary, Theorem 35.6 shows f is F-integrable.
35.17 Theorem.
If f is piecewise continuous, or bounded and piecewise monotonic,
on [a, b], then f is F-integrable.
Proof
Just as in the proof of Theorem 33.8, this follows from The-
orems 35.7, 35.16 and 35.11, provided we have the following
generalization of Exercise 32.7.
35.18 Proposition.
If f is F-integrable on [a, b] and g(x) = f(x) except for ﬁnitely many
points, then g is F-integrable. We do not claim
 b
a f dF =
 b
a g dF.
Proof
It suﬃces to show g −f is F-integrable, because then the sum
(g −f) + f would be F-integrable by Theorem 35.8(ii). Thus it
suﬃces to assume g(x) = 0 except for ﬁnitely many points. Consider
any partition P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} satisfying g(x) = 0
for all x in [a, b] \ {t0, t1, . . . , tn}. Then from Eqs. (2) and (3) in Def-
inition 35.2 on page 300 we have UF (g, P) = JF (g, P) = LF (g, P),
so g is clearly F-integrable; see Theorem 35.6, for example.

If F1 and F2 are increasing functions with continuous deriva-
tives, then Theorem 35.13 allows the formula on integration by parts
[Theorem 34.2] to be recast as
 b

F1 dF2 +
 b
a
F2 dF1 = F1(b)F2(b) −F1(a)F2(a).
There is no hope to prove this in general because if F(t) = 0 for
t < 0 and F(t) = 1 for t ≥0, then

The generalization does hold provided the functions in the integrands
take the middle values at each of their jumps, as we next prove. The
result is a special case of a theorem given by Edwin Hewitt [29].
35.19 Theorem [Integration by Parts].
Suppose F1 and F2 are increasing functions on [a, b] and deﬁne
F ∗
1 (t) = 1
2[F1(t−) + F1(t+)]
and
F ∗
2 (t) = 1

As usual, we decree F1(b+) = F1(b), F1(a−) = F1(a), etc.
Proof
Both integrals in (1) exist in view of Theorem 35.16. For an ϵ > 0,
there exists a partition P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} such that
UF1(F ∗
2 , P) −LF1(F ∗
2 , P) < ϵ.
Some algebraic manipulation [discussed in the next paragraph] shows
UF2(F ∗
1 , P) + LF1(F ∗
2 , P) = F1(b)F2(b) −F1(a)F2(a),
(2)
so that also
UF1(F ∗

Eq. (6) in Deﬁnition 35.2 [on page 300] applied to F1F2, the equality
(2) holds. The preceding algebra simpliﬁes considerably if F1 and F2
are continuous.
We next compare our approach to Riemann-Stieltjes integration
to the usual approach. For a bounded function f on [a, b], the usual
Darboux-Stieltjes integral is deﬁned via the upper sums
˜UF (f, P) =
n

and the lower sums
˜LF (f, P) =

k=1
m(f, [tk−1, tk]) · [F(tk) −F(tk−1)].
The expressions ˜UF (f), ˜LF (f) and ˜ b
af dF are deﬁned in analogy to
those in Deﬁnition 35.2 on page 300. The usual Riemann-Stieltjes
integral is deﬁned via the sums
˜SF(f, P) =


k=1
f(xk)[F(tk) −F(tk−1)],
where xk is in [tk−1, tk], and the mesh is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 32.6;
compare Deﬁnition 35.24.
The usual Riemann-Stieltjes integrability criterion implies the
usual Darboux-Stieltjes integrability criterion; these criteria are not
equivalent in general, but they are equivalent if F is continuous.
See, for example, [53, §12.2], [55, Chap. 8], or [62, Chap. 6], the most
complete treatment being in [55].
35.20 Theorem.
If f is Darboux-Stieltjes integrable on [a, b] with respect to F in the
usual sense, then f is F-integrable and the integrals agree.

These observations and a glance at the deﬁnition of LF (f, P) now
show ˜LF (f, P) ≤LF (f, P). Likewise we have ˜UF (f, P) ≥UF (f, P),
so
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) ≤˜UF (f, P) −˜LF (f, P).
(1)
If ϵ > 0, the usual theory [Theorem 32.5] shows there exists a parti-
tion P such that ˜UF (f, P)−˜LF (f, P) < ϵ. By (1) we see that we also
have UF (f, P)−LF(f, P) < ϵ, so f is F-integrable by Theorem 35.6.

We will deﬁne Riemann-Stieltjes integrals using a mesh deﬁned
in terms of F instead of the usual mesh in Deﬁnition 32.6.
35.21 Deﬁnition.
The F-mesh of a partition P is
F-mesh(P) = max{F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1) : k = 1, 2, . . . , n}.
It is convenient to restate Lemma 35.15:
35.22 Lemma.
If δ > 0, there exists a partition P such that F-mesh(P) < δ.
35.23 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is F-integrable if and only if for each
ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
F-mesh(P) < δ
implies
UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) < ϵ
(1)
for all partitions P of [a, b].
Proof
Suppose the ϵ–δ condition stated in the theorem holds. If we have
ϵ > 0, then (1) applies to some partition P by Lemma 35.22 and
hence UF (f, P) −LF (f, P) < ϵ. Since this remark applies to all
ϵ > 0, Theorem 35.6 implies f is F-integrable.
The converse is proved just as in Theorem 32.7 with “mesh”
replaced by“F-mesh” and references to Lemma 32.2 replaced by
references to Lemma 35.3.
35.24 Deﬁnition.
Let f be bounded on [a, b], and let
P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}.

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 321
A Riemann-Stieltjes sum of f associated with P and F is a sum of
the form
JF(f, P) +
n

k=1
f(xk)[F(t−
k ) −F(t+
k−1)]
where xk is in (tk−1, tk) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The function f is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable on [a, b] if there
exists r in R with the following property. For each ϵ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that
|S −r| < ϵ
(1)
for every Riemann-Stieltjes sum S of f associated with a partition
P having F-mesh(P) < δ. We call r the Riemann-Stieltjes integral
of f and temporarily write it as
RS
 b
a
f dF.
35.25 Theorem.
A bounded function f on [a, b] is F-integrable if and only if it is
Riemann-Stieltjes integrable, in which case the integrals are equal.
Proof
The proof that F-integrability implies Riemann-Stieltjes integrabil-
ity imitates the corresponding proof in Theorem 32.9. The proof of
the converse also imitates the corresponding proof, but a little care
is needed, so we give it.
Let f be a Riemann-Stieltjes integrable function, and let r be as
in Deﬁnition 35.24. Consider ϵ > 0, and let δ > 0 be as provided
in Deﬁnition 35.24. By Lemma 35.22 there exists a partition P =
{a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} with F-mesh(P) < δ. For each k =
1, 2, . . . , n, select xk in (tk−1, tk) so that f(xk) < m(f, (tk−1, tk)) + ϵ.
The Riemann-Stieltjes sum S for this choice of xk’s satisﬁes
S ≤LF (f, P) + ϵ[F(b) −F(a)]
and also
|S −r| < ϵ;

6. Integration
322
hence LF (f) ≥LF (f, P) > r −ϵ −ϵ[F(b) −F(a)]. Since ϵ > 0
is arbitrary, it follows that LF (f) ≥r and similarly UF (f) ≤r.
Therefore LF (f) = UF (f) = r. Thus f is F-integrable and

35.26 Remarks.
In the deﬁnition of upper and lower Darboux sums, we used
closed intervals [tk−1, tk] for Riemann integrals, in §32, and we
used open intervals (tk−1, tk) in this section. The reason we used
closed intervals in §32 is because that is completely standard.
The reason we used open intervals in this section is because
our development was motivated by the desire to have Riemann-
Stieltjes integrals more compatible with their measure-theoretic
generalization, Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals, where the “measurable
partition”
[a, b] =
n
k=0
{tk} ∪
n
k=1
(tk−1, tk)
is a natural starting point. Moreover, the arguments in Examples 1
and 3 and in Proposition 35.18 would be somewhat more complicated
if we had used closed intervals.
The reader may wonder whether the theories would have changed
if we had used closed intervals in this section or open intervals in
§32. It turns out there would be no essential changes, as we now
explain. We do so using increasing functions F, as in this section; see
Corollary 35.28 for the case of Riemann integrals. We write LF (f, P)
and UF (f, P) for the lower and upper Darboux-Stieltjes sums using
closed intervals [tk−1, tk] instead of open intervals (tk−1, tk). These
will sometimes be diﬀerent from the corresponding Darboux-Stieltjes
sums deﬁned in Deﬁnition 35.2 on page 300. But if we deﬁne
UF (f) = inf{UF(f, P) : P partitions [a, b]}
and we deﬁne LF (f) similarly, we have the following fact.

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 323
35.27 Proposition.
If f is bounded on [a, b], then U F(f) = UF (f) and LF(f) = LF (f).
Thus f is integrable using closed intervals in the Darboux-Stieltjes
deﬁnitions if and only if it is integrable using open intervals, and in
this case the integrals are equal.
Proof
We prove UF (f) = UF (f); the proof of LF(f) = LF (f) is similar.
For each partition P of [a, b], it is clear that UF (f, P) ≤UF (f, P).
Therefore UF (f) ≤UF (f) and it suﬃces to show
UF (f) ≤UF (f).
(1)
Let ϵ > 0. There is a partition P of [a, b] such that
UF (f, P) < UF (f) + ϵ
4.
(2)
Note (2) holds for any reﬁnement of P by Lemma 35.3.
As before, if there are any jumps we list them as u1, u2, . . . and
deﬁne cj = F(u+
j ) −F(u−
j ). Since  cj is ﬁnite, there is an integer
N so that ∞
j=N+1 cj < ϵ
4. Of course, this step is trivial if F has
only ﬁnitely many jumps. We ﬁrst reﬁne P so that for every j ≤N,
the jump uj is equal to some tk in P. Then if P1 and P2 are such
reﬁnements of P, we have
|JF(f, P1) −JF(f, P2)| ≤
∞

j=N+1
cj < ϵ
4.
(3)
Now we further reﬁne P as follows. Using the deﬁnitions of F(t−
k )
and F(t+
k ), we see there are points sk and uk for k = 0, 1, . . . , n so
that
a = s0 = t0 < u0 < s1 < t1 < u1 < s2 < t2 < u2 < s3 < · · ·
· · · < sn−1 < tn−1 < un−1 < sn < tn = un = b,
and all F(u−
k ) −F(t+
k ) and F(t−
k ) −F(s+
k ) are less than
ϵ
4(n+1)B,
where B is a positive bound for the absolute value |f|. We estimate
UF (f, P ♯) for the new partition P ♯consisting of all sk, tk and uk.

Summing these three inequalities, we see
UF (f, P ♯) −JF(f, P ♯) < UF (f, P) −JF(f, P) + 2ϵ
4 .
Now we invoke (3) to conclude
UF (f, P ♯) < UF (f, P) −JF(f, P) + JF (f, P ♯) + 2ϵ
4 < UF (f, P) + 3ϵ
4 .
Finally, using (2), we obtain U F(f, P ♯) < UF (f) + ϵ; hence
UF (f) ≤U F(f, P ♯) < UF (f) + ϵ.
Since ϵ is arbitrary, (1) is established.
Proposition 35.27 is true for F(t) = t, so it is true for Riemann
integrals. However, for this important case, we use closed intervals as
is traditional. Thus our notation U(f, P), U(f) refers to the theory
using closed intervals, and we do not want to confuse the situation
here by switching to U(f, P, U(f), etc. To distinguish the theory
using open intervals, we introduce new notation U♭(f, P), U♭(f), etc.
35.28 Corollary.
In §32, on the Riemann integral, the deﬁnitions of L(f, P) and
U(f, P) for upper and lower Darboux sums could have used open
intervals (tk−1, tk) instead of closed intervals [tk−1, tk]. The resulting

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 325
Darboux sums L♭(f, P) and U♭(f, P) might be diﬀerent. But if we
deﬁne
U♭(f) = inf{U♭(f, P) : P partitions [a, b]}
and we deﬁne L♭(f) similarly, then we have U♭(f) = U(f) and
L♭(f) = L(f). Thus the two approaches to Riemann integration give
the same integrals.
Proof
This is Proposition 35.27 for F(t) = t; only the notation here is
diﬀerent.
We next give a generalization of Theorem 35.13. The proof is
somewhat complicated and uses Corollary 35.28. It was originally
worked out by me and my colleague Theodore W. Palmer.
35.29 Theorem.
Suppose F is diﬀerentiable on [a, b] and F ′ is Riemann integrable on
[a, b]. A bounded function f on [a, b] is F-integrable if and only if
fF ′ is Riemann integrable, in which case
 b
a
f dF =
 b
a
f(x)F ′(x) dx.
We will give the proof after Lemma 35.30 and its corollary.
First look at Deﬁnition 35.2 on page 300. Being diﬀerentiable, F is
continuous. So the JF terms in the deﬁnition are 0, and we have
UF (f, P) =
n

k=1
M(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(tk) −F(tk−1)]
and
LF(f, P) =
n

k=1
m(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(tk) −F(tk−1)].
We will use these formulas in the proof of Lemma 35.30 below. We
also use the notation U♭(f), etc., from Corollary 35.28.

6. Integration
326
35.30 Lemma.
Assume F is diﬀerentiable on [a, b], F ′ is Riemann integrable on
[a, b], and f is a bounded function on [a, b]. Let B be a positive bound
for |f|. If we have U♭(F ′, P) −L♭(F ′, P) < ϵ/B, then
|UF (f, P) −U♭(fF ′, P)| ≤ϵ
(1)
and
|LF (f, P) −L♭(fF ′, P)| ≤ϵ.
(2)
Proof
Let P = {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b}. By the Mean Value
Theorem 29.3, for each k there exists xk in (tk−1, tk) so that
F(tk) −F(tk−1) = F ′(xk) · (tk −tk−1).
(3)
Now consider an arbitrary yk in (tk−1, tk) and observe
n

k=1
|F ′(xk) −F ′(yk)| · (tk −tk−1) ≤U♭(F ′, P) −L♭(F ′, P) < ϵ

since
the

is

by
n
k=1[M(F ′, (tk−1, tk))
−m(F ′, (tk−1, tk))] · (tk −tk−1). Applying this and (3), we obtain

k=1 f(yk)[F(tk) −F(tk−1)] −n
k=1 f(yk) · F ′(yk) · (tk −tk−1)|

k=1 f(yk) · F ′(xk) · (tk −tk−1) −n

k=1 |F ′(xk) −F ′(yk)| · (tk −tk−1) < ϵ.
Therefore for yk in (tk−1, tk), we have

k=1 f(yk) · F ′(yk) · (tk −tk−1)

(6)

§35. * Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals 327

conclude4

k=1
M(f, (tk−1, tk)) · [F(tk) −F(tk−1)] ≤ϵ + U♭(fF ′, P).

M(fF ′, (tk−1, tk))·(tk −tk−1) ≤ϵ+UF(f, P). (8)
Now (1) follows from (7) and (8); (2) has a similar proof.
35.31 Corollary.
With F and f as in Lemma 35.30, we have UF (f) = U(fF ′) and
LF (f) = L(fF ′).
Proof
Consider ϵ > 0. Select partitions P1 and P2 of [a, b] so that
|UF (f, P1) −UF (f)| < ϵ
and
|U(fF ′) −U♭(fF ′, P2)| < ϵ.
Such a partition P2 exists because U(fF ′) = U♭(fF ′) by Corol-
lary 35.28. Since F ′ is Riemann integrable by hypothesis, U♭(F ′) =
U(F ′) = L(F ′) = L♭(F ′). So there exists a partition P3 so that
U♭(F ′, P3) −L♭(F ′, P3) < ϵ/B.
The last three inequalities still hold if we replace P1, P2, P3 by a
common reﬁnement P. Now by Lemma 35.30, we have
|UF (f, P) −U♭(fF ′, P)| ≤ϵ,
so by the triangle inequality, we have
|UF (f) −U(fF ′)| < 3ϵ.
Since ϵ is arbitrary, UF (f) = U(fF ′). Likewise LF (f) = L(fF ′).
4Some readers may appreciate more explanation. To avoid breaking the ﬂow of
the proofs, this will be provided after the proof of Theorem 35.29 is completed.

6. Integration
328
Proof of Theorem 35.29
Suppose f is F-integrable. Then UF (f) = LF(f). Hence U(fF ′) =
L(fF ′) by Corollary 35.31. Thus fF ′ is Riemann integrable and
 b
a
f dF = UF (f) = U(fF ′) =

f(x)F ′(x)dx.
Now suppose fF ′ is Riemann integrable. Then U(fF ′) = L(fF ′);
hence UF (f) = LF(f). Thus f is F-integrable and
 b
a
f(x)F ′(x)dx = U(fF ′) = UF (f) =

How did we so quickly conclude inequalities (5) and (6) in
Lemma 35.30? Intuitively, we knew we could select each yk so that
f(yk) is very close to M(f, (tk−1, tk)), which appears in the deﬁnition
of UF (f, P) given after the statement of Theorem 35.29. Similarly,
we concluded inequality (6) because we could select each yk so that
(fF ′)(yk) is very close to M(fF ′, (tk−1, tk)), which appears in the
deﬁnition of U♭(fF ′, P). In fact, these conclusions follow from the
following lemma.

* Improper Integrals 331
§36
* Improper Integrals
The Riemann integral in §32 has been deﬁned only for functions that
are bounded on a closed interval [a, b]. It is convenient to be able to
integrate some functions that are unbounded or are deﬁned on an
unbounded interval.
36.1 Deﬁnition.
Consider an interval [a, b) where b is ﬁnite or +∞. Suppose f is a
function on [a, b) that is integrable on each [a, d] for a < d < b, and
suppose the limit
lim
d→b−
 d
a
f(x) dx
exists either as a ﬁnite number, +∞or −∞. Then we deﬁne
 b
a
f(x) dx = lim
d→b−
 d
a
f(x) dx.
(1)
If b is ﬁnite and f is integrable on [a, b], this deﬁnition agrees with
that in Deﬁnition 32.1 [Exercise 36.1]. If b = +∞or if f is not
integrable on [a, b], but the limit in (1) exists, then (1) deﬁnes an
improper integral.
An analogous deﬁnition applies if f is deﬁned on (a, b] where a is
ﬁnite or −∞and if f is integrable on each [c, b] for a < c < b. Then
we deﬁne
 b
a
f(x) dx = lim
c→a+
 b
c
f(x) dx
(2)
whenever the limit exists.
If f is deﬁned on (a, b) and integrable on all closed subintervals
[c, d], then we ﬁx α in (a, b) and deﬁne
 b
a
f(x) dx =
 α
a
f(x) dx +
 b
α
f(x) dx
(3)
provided the integrals on the right exist and the sum is not of the
form +∞+ (−∞). Here we agree ∞+ L = ∞if L ̸= −∞and
(−∞) + L = −∞if L ̸= ∞. It is easy [Exercise 36.2] to see this
deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of α.

6. Integration
332
Whenever the improper integrals deﬁned above exist and are
ﬁnite, the integrals are said to converge. Otherwise they diverge to
+∞or to −∞.
Example 1
Consider f(x) = 1
x for x ∈(0, ∞). For d > 1, we have
 d
1
1
x dx =
loge d, so
 ∞
1
1
x dx = lim
d→∞loge d = +∞.
This improper integral diverges to +∞. For 0 < c < 1, we have
 1
c
1
x dx = −loge c, so
 1
0
1
x dx = lim
c→0+[−loge c] = +∞.
Also we have
 ∞
0
1
x = +∞.
Example 2
Consider f(x) = x−p for x ∈[1, ∞) and a ﬁxed positive number
p ̸= 1. For d > 1,
 d
1
x−p dx =
1
1 −p[d1−p −1].
It follows that
 ∞
1
x−p dx =
1
1 −p[0 −1] =
1
p −1
if
p > 1
and
 ∞
1
x−p dx = +∞
if
0 < p < 1.
Example 3
We have  d
0 sin x dx = 1−cosd for all d. The value (1−cos d) oscillates
between 0 and 2, as d →∞, and therefore the limit
lim
d→∞
 d
0
sin x dx
does not exist.

§36.
* Improper Integrals 333
Thus the symbol
 ∞
0 sin x dx has no meaning and is not an improper
integral. Similarly,
 0
−∞sin x dx and
 ∞
−∞sin x dx have no meaning.
Note the limit
lim
a→∞
 a
−a
sin x dx
clearly exists and equals 0. When such a “symmetric” limit ex-
ists even though the improper integral  ∞
−∞does not, we have
what is called a Cauchy principal value of  ∞
−∞. Thus 0 is the
Cauchy principal value of  ∞
−∞sin x dx, but this is not an improper
integral.
It is especially valuable to extend Riemann-Stieltjes integrals to
inﬁnite intervals; see the discussion after Theorem 36.4 below. Let F
be a bounded increasing function on some interval I. The function
F can be extended to all of R by a simple device: if I is bounded
below, deﬁne
F(t) = inf{F(u) : u ∈I}
for
t ≤inf I;
if I is bounded above, deﬁne
F(t) = sup{F(u) : u ∈I}
for
t ≥sup I.
For this reason, we will henceforth assume F is an increasing function
on all of R. We will use the notations
F(−∞) =
lim
t→−∞F(t)
and
F(∞) = lim
t→∞F(t).
Improper Riemann-Stieltjes integrals are deﬁned in analogy to
improper Riemann integrals.
36.2 Deﬁnition.
Suppose f is F-integrable on each interval [a, b] in R. We make the
following deﬁnitions whenever the limits exist:
 ∞
0
f dF = lim
b→∞
 b
0
f dF;
 0
−∞
f dF =
lim
a→−∞
 0
a
f dF.

6. Integration
334
If both limits exist and their sum does not have the form ∞+(−∞),
we deﬁne
 ∞
−∞
f dF =
 0
−∞
f dF +
 ∞
0
f dF.
If this sum is ﬁnite, we say f is F-integrable on R. If f is F-integrable
on R for F(t) = t [i.e., the integrals are Riemann integrals], we say
f is integrable on R.
36.3 Theorem.
If f is F-integrable on each interval [a, b] and if f(x) ≥0 for all
x ∈R, then f is F-integrable on R or else
 ∞
−∞f dF = +∞.
Proof
We indicate why lima→−∞
 0
a f dF exists, and leave the case of
limb→∞
 b
0 f dF to the reader. Let h(a) =  0
a f dF for a < 0, and note
a′ < a < 0 implies h(a′) ≥h(a). This property implies lima→−∞h(a)
exists and
lim
a→−∞h(a) = sup{h(a) : a ∈(−∞, 0)}.
We omit the simple argument.
36.4 Theorem.
Suppose −∞< F(−∞) < F(∞) < ∞. Let f be a bounded func-
tion on R that is F-integrable on each interval [a, b]. Then f is
F-integrable on R.
Proof
Select a constant B such that |f(x)| ≤B for all x ∈R. Since we
have F(∞)−F(−∞) < ∞, constant functions are F-integrable. Since
0 ≤f +B ≤2B, Theorem 36.3 shows f +B is F-integrable. It follows
[Exercise 36.10] that f = (f + B) + (−B) is also F-integrable.
Increasing functions F deﬁned on R come up naturally in prob-
ability and statistics. In these disciplines, F is called a distribution
function if we also have F(−∞) = 0 and F(∞) = 1. Of course,
the function F(t) = t that corresponds to the Riemann integral
is not a distribution function. Here is how a distribution function

§36.
* Improper Integrals 335
comes up in probability. Consider a random experiment with numer-
ical outcomes; then F(t) can represent the probability the numerical
value will be ≤t. Thus F will be right continuous. As a very simple
example, suppose the experiment involves tossing three fair coins
and counting the number of heads. The numerical values 0, 1, 2,
and 3 will result with probabilities 1
8, 3
8, 3
8, and 1
8, respectively. The
corresponding distribution function is deﬁned in Example 2 of §35,
page 303, and sketched in Fig. 35.1.
Frequently a distribution function F has the form
F(t) =
 t
−∞
g(x) dx
for an integrable function g satisfying g(x) ≥0 for all x ∈R. Then
g is called a density for F. Note we must have
 ∞
−∞
g(x) dx = 1.
If g is continuous, then g(t) = F ′(t) for all t by Theorem 34.3.
Example 4
It turns out that
 ∞
−∞e−x2 dx = √π [Exercise 36.7] and hence
 ∞
−∞
e−x2/2 dx =

The most important density in probability is the normal density

* A Discussion of Exponents
and Logarithms
In this book we have carefully developed the theory, but have been
casual about using the familiar exponential, logarithmic and trigono-
metric functions in examples and exercises. Most readers probably
found this an acceptable approach, since they are comfortable with
these basic functions. In this section, we indicate three ways to de-
velop the exponential and logarithmic functions assuming only the
axioms in Chap. 1 and the theoretical results in later chapters. We
will provide proofs for the third approach.
Recall, for x in R and a positive integer n, xn is the product of
x by itself n times. For x ̸= 0, we have the convention x0 = 1. And
for x ̸= 0 and negative integers −n where n ∈N, we deﬁne x−n to
be the reciprocal of xn, i.e., x−n = (xn)−1.
37.1 Piecemeal Approach.
This approach starts with Example 2 on page 238 and Exercise 29.15
where it is shown that xr is meaningful whenever x > 0 and r is

rational, i.e., r ∈Q. Moreover,
if
h(x) = xr,
then
h′(x) = rxr−1.
The algebraic properties xrxs = xr+s and (xy)r = xryr can be veri-
ﬁed for r, s ∈Q and positive x and y. For any t ∈R and x > 0, we
deﬁne
xt = sup{xr : r ∈Q and r ≤t}
and
 1
x
t
= (xt)−1.
This deﬁnes xt for x > 0. It can be shown that with this deﬁnition
xt is ﬁnite and the algebraic properties mentioned above still hold.
Further, it can be shown that h(x) = xt is diﬀerentiable and h′(x) =
txt−1.
Next we can consider a ﬁxed b > 0 and the function B deﬁned by
B(x) = bx for x ∈R. The function B is diﬀerentiable and B′(x) =
cbB(x) for some constant cb. We elaborate on this last claim. In view
of Exercise 28.14, we can write
B′(x) = lim
h→0
bx+h −bx
h
= bx · lim
h→0
bh −1
h
provided these limits exist. Some analysis shows that the last limit
does exist, so
B′(x) = cbB(x)
where
cb = lim
h→0
1
h[bh −1].
It turns out that cb = 1 for a certain b, known universally as e.
Since B is one-to-one if b ̸= 1, B has an inverse function L which
is named L(y) = logb y. Since B is diﬀerentiable, Theorem 29.9 on
page 237 can be applied to show L is diﬀerentiable and
L′(y) =
1
cby.
Finally, the familiar properties of logb can be established for L.
When all the details are supplied, the above approach is very
tedious. It has one, and only one, merit; it is direct without any

§37.
* A Discussion of Exponents and Logarithms 341
tricks. One could call it the “brute force approach.” The next two
approaches begin with some well deﬁned mathematical object [either
a power series or an integral] and then work backwards to develop the
familiar properties of exponentials and logarithms. In both instances,
for motivation we will draw on more advanced facts we believe but
which have not been established in this book.
37.2 Exponential Power Series Approach.
This approach is adopted in two of our favorite books: [16, §4.9]
and [62, Chap. 8]. As noted in Example 1 of §31, we believe
ex =
∞

k=0
1
k!xk
though we have not proved this, since we have not even deﬁned
exponentials yet. In this approach, we deﬁne
E(x) =
∞

k=0
1
k!xk,
(1)
and we deﬁne e = E(1). The series here has radius of convergence
+∞[Example 1, §23], and E is diﬀerentiable on R [Theorem 26.5].
It is easy [Exercise 26.5] to show E′ = E. The fundamental property
E(x + y) = E(x)E(y)
(2)
can be established using only the facts observed above. Actually [62]
uses a theorem on multiplication of absolutely convergent series,
but [16] avoids this. Other properties of E can be quickly established.
In particular, E is strictly increasing on R and has an inverse L. The-
orem 29.9 on page 237 assures us L is diﬀerentiable and L′(y) = 1
y.
For rational r and x > 0, xr was deﬁned in Exercise 29.15. Applying
that exercise and the chain rule to g(x) = L(xr) −rL(x), we ﬁnd
g′(x) = 0 for x > 0. Hence g is a constant function. Since g(1) = 0,
we conclude
L(xr) = rL(x)
for
r ∈Q
and
x > 0.
(3)
For b > 0 and rational r, (3) implies
br = E(L(br)) = E(rL(b)).

7. Capstone
342
Because of this, we deﬁne
bx = E(xL(b))
for
x ∈R.
The familiar properties of exponentials and their inverses [loga-
rithms!] are now easy to prove.
The choice between the approach just outlined and the next ap-
proach, which we will present in some detail, is really a matter of
taste and depends on the appeal of power series. One genuine ad-
vantage to the exponential approach is that the series in (1) deﬁning
E is equally good for deﬁning E(z) = ez for complex numbers z.
37.3 Logarithmic Integral Approach.
Let us attempt to solve f ′ = f where f never vanishes; we expect
to obtain E(x) = ex as one of the solutions. This simple diﬀerential
equation can be written
f ′
f = 1.
(1)
In view of the chain rule, if we could ﬁnd L satisfying L′(y) = 1
y,
then Eq. (1) would simplify to
(L ◦f)′ = 1,
so one of the solutions would satisfy
L ◦f(y) = y.
In other words, one solution f of (1) would be an inverse to L where
L′(y) = 1
y. But by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II [Theo-
rem 34.3 on page 294], we know such a function L exists. Since we
also expect L(1) = 0, we deﬁne
L(y) =
 y
1
1
t dt
for
y ∈(0, ∞).
We use this deﬁnition to prove the basic facts about logarithms and
exponentials.

z ) = L(y) −L(z) for y, z ∈(0, ∞).
(iv) limy→∞L(y) = +∞and limy→0+ L(y) = −∞.
Proof
It is trivial to show the function f(t) = t is continuous on R, so its
reciprocal 1
t is continuous on (0, ∞) by Theorem 17.4. It is easy to
see L is strictly increasing, and the rest of (i) follows immediately
from Theorem 34.3.
Assertion (ii) can be proved directly [Exercise 37.1]. Alterna-
tively, ﬁx z and consider g(y) = L(yz)−L(y)−L(z). Since g(1) = 0,
it suﬃces to show g′(y) = 0 for y ∈(0, ∞) [Corollary 29.4]. But since
z is ﬁxed, we have
g′(y) = z
yz −1
y −0 = 0.
To check (iii), note L(1
z ) + L(z) = L(1
z · z) = L(1) = 0, so that
L(1

= L(y) −L(z).
To see (iv), ﬁrst observe L(2) > 0 and L(2n) = n · L(2) in view
of (ii). Thus limn→∞L(2n) = +∞. Since L is increasing, it follows
that limy→∞L(y) = +∞. Likewise L(1
2) < 0 and L((1
2)n) = n·L(1
2),
so limy→0+ L(y) = −∞.
The Intermediate Value Theorem 18.2 on page 134 shows L maps
(0, ∞) onto R. Since L is a strictly increasing function, it has a
continuous strictly increasing inverse [Theorem 18.4 on page 137]
and the inverse has domain R.

37.5 Deﬁnition.
We denote the function inverse to L by E. Thus
E(L(y)) = y
for
y ∈(0, ∞)
and
L(E(x)) = x
for
x ∈R.
We also deﬁne e = E(1) so that

37.6 Theorem.
(i) The function E is strictly increasing, continuous and diﬀeren-
tiable on R. Then
E′(x) = E(x)
for
x ∈R.
(ii) E(u + v) = E(u)E(v) for u, v ∈R.
(iii) limx→∞E(x) = +∞and limx→−∞E(x) = 0.
Proof
All of (i) follows from Theorem 37.4 in conjunction with Theo-
rem 29.9 on page 237. In particular,
E′(x) =
1
L′(E(x)) =
1
1
E(x)
= E(x).
If u, v ∈R, then u = L(y) and v = L(z) for some y, z ∈(0, ∞).
Then u + v = L(yz) by (ii) of Theorem 37.4, so
E(u + v) = E(L(yz)) = yz = E(L(y))E(L(z)) = E(u)E(v).
Assertion (iii) follows from (iv) of Theorem 37.4 [Exercise 37.2].
Consider b > 0 and r ∈Q, say r =
m
n where m, n ∈Z and
n > 0. It is customary to write br for that positive number a such
that an = bm. By (ii) of Theorem 37.4, we have nL(a) = mL(b);
hence
br = a = E(L(a)) = E

This motivates our next deﬁnition and also shows the deﬁnition is
compatible with the usage of fractional powers in algebra.

For b > 0 and b ̸= 1, the inverse of B(x) = bx is written logb. The

bx = y.
Note loge y = L(y) for y > 0.
37.10 Theorem.
Fix b > 0, b ̸= 1.
(i) The function logb is continuous and diﬀerentiable on (0, ∞).
(ii) If b > 1, logb is strictly increasing; if b < 1, logb is strictly
decreasing.
(iii) logb(yz) = logb y + logb z for y, z ∈(0, ∞).
(iv) logb(y
z) = logb y −logb z for y, z ∈(0, ∞).
Proof
This follows from Theorem 37.4 and the identity logb y =
L(y)

§38
* Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable
Functions
The history of continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable functions is long
and fascinating. Examples of such functions were constructed as early
as 1831, by Bernard Bolzano. But a version wasn’t published until

7. Capstone
348
Karl Weierstrass did so in 1875 [69]; he had given examples in lec-
tures before that and formally presented his result on July 18, 1872.
These early examples tended to be of the form 	∞
n=0 bn cos(anπx)
or 	∞
n=1
sin(n2πx)
n2
. The delay in publicizing these examples is due
to the suspicion of mathematicians of the era that the deﬁnition of
“function” should not be so general as to allow such monstrosities.
Excellent brief accounts are described in William Dunham’s
book [21, Chap. 9] and David Bressoud’s book [13, §6.4]. Dun-
ham asserts that Hermite, Poincare and Picard were appalled by
Weierstrass’s “pathological example.” Bressoud has a quotation from
Henri Poincar´e that refers to these abnormal functions as coun-
terexamples to the “ﬂaws in our forefathers’ reasoning.. . ”. There
is also a quote of Hermite referring to the “plague of functions that
do not have derivatives”. He had no idea how bad a plague; see
Theorem 38.3 on page 350 and the paragraph preceding it.
An especially thorough and detailed history can be found in
Johan Thim’s Master’s thesis [66].
Karl Stromberg [65, Example (4.8), page 174] provides an elegant
variant of van der Waerden’s example [68], published in 1930. We
repeat Stromberg’s example almost verbatim because we don’t see
how to improve it.
38.1 Van der Waerden’s Example.
We provide an example of a continuous function on R that is nowhere
diﬀerentiable. Let φ(x) = |x| for |x| ≤2 and extend it to be 4-
periodic, i.e., φ(x + 4q) = φ(x) for all x ∈R and q ∈Z. Since the
graph of φ has slope ±1 on intervals between even integers, we have
|φ(s) −φ(t)| = |s −t|
(1)
provided there is no even integer in the open interval (s, t). The
graph of φ is similar to that of g in Fig. 25.1 on page 204; in fact,
φ(x) = 2g(x
2) for all x.
The continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable function f is deﬁned by
f(x) =
∞

n=1
fn(x)
where
fn(x) = 4−nφ(4nx).

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 349
Since each fn is continuous and 	∞
n=1 4−n · 2 < ∞, the Weierstrass
M-test 25.7 on page 205 and Theorem 25.5 show f is continuous
on R.
Fix a in R; we will show f is not diﬀerentiable at a by showing
there is a sequence (hk) of nonzero numbers satisfying
hk →0
and
lim
k→∞
f(a + hk) −f(a)
hk
does not exist.
(2)
Until Eq. (5), the integer k ≥1 is ﬁxed. There exists ϵk = ±1 so that
no even integers lie between 4ka and 4ka + ϵk. From (1), we have
|φ(4ka + ϵk) −φ(4ka)| = 1.
In fact, for n ≤k, there are no even integers between 4na and
4na + 4n−kϵk, because if 4na < 2q < 4na + 4n−kϵk for some q ∈Z,
multiplying through by the integer 4k−n would yield 4ka < 4k−n·2q <
4ka + ϵk. Thus, by (1) again,
|φ(4na + 4n−kϵk) −φ(4na)| = 4n−k
for
1 ≤n ≤k.
(3)
Since φ is 4-periodic, we also have
|φ(4na + 4n−kϵk) −φ(4na)| = 0
for
n > k.
(4)
Combining (3) and (4) with the deﬁnition of fn, we conclude
|fn(a + 4−kϵk) −fn(a)| = 4−k
for
n ≤k
and = 0 for
n > k.
We now let hk = 4−kϵk so that
|fn(a + hk) −fn(a)| = 4−k
for
n ≤k
and = 0 for
n > k.
Therefore the diﬀerence quotient,
f(a + hk) −f(a)
hk
=
k

n=1
fn(a + hk) −fn(a)
hk
=
k

n=1
fn(a + hk) −fn(a)
4−kϵk
=
k

n=1
(±1),
(5)
is an even integer for even k and an odd integer for odd k. Therefore
the diﬀerence quotients in (5) cannot converge, as k →∞. Since
limk hk = 0, this proves (2) so that f is not diﬀerentiable at a.

7. Capstone
350
38.2 Remark.
For later use, note the function φ in the preceding proof satisﬁes
sup{|φ(y)| : y ∈R} = 2, and for any y in R we have
|φ(y + h) −φ(y)| = h
for suﬃciently small
h > 0.
(1)
We’ve seen that constructing continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable
functions can be a challenge. Now we take a more abstract approach.
In the discussion after Deﬁnition 22.6 on page 183, it is observed that
the space C(R) of bounded continuous functions on R is a complete
metric space using the metric
d(f, g) = sup{|f(y) −g(y)| : y ∈R}
for all
f, g ∈C(R).
Recall from Example 7(b) on page 174 that the irrational numbers
are much more prevalent than the rational numbers, because the set
Q is of ﬁrst category in the complete metric space R. Similarly, as we
will see in the next theorem, the continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable
functions are more prevalent than the diﬀerentiable ones. One might
say mathematicians of the 19th century viewed the continuous
nowhere-diﬀerentiable functions as the “irrational functions.”
As just noted, the next theorem shows “most” functions in C(R)
are nowhere diﬀerentiable. The proof uses the Baire Category Theo-
rem 21.8 in the enrichment Sect. 21; see page 173. In 1931, S. Banach
and S. Mazurkiewicz independently published this result in Studia
Mathematica.
38.3 Theorem.
Let D consist of the functions f in C(R) that have a derivative at at
least one point. Then D is ﬁrst category in C(R).
Proof
Consider f in D. Then for some x in R, the derivative f ′(x) exists.
Choose m so that |x| ≤m and |f ′(x)| < m. There exists δ in (0, 1)
so that




f(x + h) −f(x)
h
−f ′(x)




 < m −|f ′(x)|
for all
h ∈(0, δ).

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 351
Select a positive integer n ≥m satisfying 1
n < δ. Then
x ∈[−n, n]
and
|f(x + h) −f(x)| ≤hn
for
h ∈

0, 1
n

. (1)
Thus f belongs to Fn, which is deﬁned to be all f in C(R) such that
some x in R satisﬁes (1) above. We have just shown D ⊆∪∞
n=1Fn, so
by the Baire Category Theorem 21.8 on page 173, it suﬃces to show
each Fn is closed in C(R) and is nowhere dense in C(R).
To see Fn is closed, consider a sequence (fk) in Fn converging
to f in C(R). As noted after Deﬁnition 22.6, this means fk →f
uniformly on R. We will show f is in Fn. For each k, there exists xk
so that
xk ∈[−n, n]
and
|fk(xk +h)−fk(xk)| ≤hn for h ∈

0, 1
n

. (2)
By the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 11.5, a subsequence of (xk)
converges to some x in [−n, n]; to avoid subsequence notation, we
will assume the sequence (xk) itself converges to x. Since xk →x and
fk →f uniformly, we have fk(xk +h) →f(x+h) for each h ∈[0, 1
n);
see Exercise 24.17 on page 200. For each h in (0, 1
n), we take the limit
in (2) as k →∞to obtain (1). Hence f belongs to Fn, and Fn is
closed.
To show Fn is nowhere dense, it suﬃces to show no ball Br(g) =
{f ∈C(R) : d(f, g) < r} is a subset of any Fn, i.e., every such ball
contains a function in C(R)\Fn. By the corollary to the Weierstrass
Approximation Theorem 27.5 on page 220, there is a polynomial p
such that sup{|g(y) −p(y)| : y ∈[−n −1, n + 1]} < r
2, p(−n −1) =
g(−n −1) and p(n + 1) = g(n + 1). The function p on R, deﬁned by
p(y) = p(y) for |y| ≤n+1 and p(y) = g(y) for |y| ≥n+1, is in C(R)
and satisﬁes d(g, p) < r
2. We choose K ≥n so that it also satisﬁes
K > sup{|p′(y)| : y ∈[−n −1, n + 1]}. Then for each x in [−n, n],
the Mean Value Theorem 29.3 on page 233 implies
|p(x + h) −p(x)| ≤hK
for suﬃciently small
h > 0.

and
|ψ(x + h) −ψ(x)| > 2Kh

) works. Since d(p, g) < r
2, inequality (4) shows p+ψ belongs
to Br(g). From (5) and (3), we see
|(p + ψ)(x + h) −(p + ψ)(x)| > hK ≥hn
for each x ∈[−n, n] and suﬃciently small h > 0, which shows p + ψ
cannot be in Fn.
In Theorem 38.5 below, we give another interesting application
of the Baire Category Theorem 21.8. It is due to Corominas and
Sunyer Balaguer [17, 1954]. See also Boas [9, Chap. 1, §10], Phillips
[52, Chap. 4, §3, Theorem 18], and Donoghue [20, § I.11]. Interesting
generalizations can be found in [17] and Kr¨uppel [38]. There are
relatively straightforward versions for holomorphic complex-valued
functions; see, e.g., Burckel [14, Example 5.64].
First, we give an easy result. Henceforth, when we refer to an
open interval (α, β), we allow α = −∞and β = ∞, so that in
particular (α, β) may be R. As in Sect. 31, we write f (n) for the nth
derivative of f.
38.4 Proposition.
Let f be a function on an open interval (α, β), and suppose there is
an integer n such that f (n)(x) = 0 for all x. Then f agrees with a
polynomial on (α, β) of degree at most n −1.
Proof
This can be seen by integrating the function f (n) n times. At
each step, one obtains a polynomial of one higher degree; see
Corollary 29.5 and Exercise 29.7.
We write C∞((α, β)) for the space of functions f inﬁnitely diﬀer-
entiable on (α, β), i.e., all the derivatives f (n) exist on (α, β). Here
we agree f (0) = f.

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 353
38.5 Theorem.
Suppose f is in C∞((α, β)), and suppose for each x in (α, β), there
is an integer nx (depending on x) such that f (nx)(x) = 0. Then f is
a polynomial on (α, β).
We begin with a lemma.
38.6 Lemma.
Suppose x0 is in R, p and q are polynomials, and f is a C∞function
deﬁned on an interval containing x0 that agrees with p on an interval
(x0 −h, x0] and agrees with q on an interval [x0, x0 +h). Then p = q.
Proof
Assume p ̸= q, and let m be the degree of the polynomial p −q.
Then (p −q)(m)(x0) ̸= 0, contradicting p(m)(x0) = f (m)(x0) =
q(m)(x0).
Proof of Theorem 38.5
It suﬃces to show that f agrees with a polynomial on every closed
subinterval [c, d] of (α, β). To see this is suﬃcient, consider a de-
creasing sequence (cn) with limit α and an increasing sequence (dn)
with limit β, where c1 < d1. For each n, let pn be a polynomial that
agrees with f on [cn, dn]. Then each pn agrees with p1 on [c1, d1].
Hence pn = p1 for all n.1 It follows that f = p1 on (α, β).
Step 1. In this step, we show that every nondegenerate closed
subinterval2 I of [c, d] contains an open subinterval J on which f is a
polynomial. For each k ≥0, we let Ek = {x ∈I : f (k)(x) = 0}. Then,
by hypothesis I = 
k≥0 Ek, and by the continuity of the function f
and all of its derivatives, each Ek is closed. By the Baire Category
Theorem 21.8 on page 173, for some index n, En has nonempty
interior. Thus, for such an index, there is an open subinterval J ⊆En
of I such that f (n)(x) = 0 for all x ∈J. By Proposition 38.4, f agrees
with a polynomial on J, as claimed.
1Polynomials that agree on an inﬁnite set are equal; otherwise their diﬀerence
would be a nonzero polynomial with inﬁnitely many zeros.
2Nondegenerate here means that its endpoints are not equal.

7. Capstone
354
Step 2. In this step, we identify maximal nondegenerate closed
subintervals of [c, d] on which the restriction of f is a polynomial. For
any polynomial p that agrees with f on an open interval containing
a point x0 in [c, d], let
ap(x0) = inf{x ∈[c, x0] : f = p
on
[x, x0]}
and
bp(x0) = sup{x ∈[x0, d] : f = p
on
[x0, x]}.
Let Ip(x0) = [ap(x0), bp(x0)], and note ap(x0) < bp(x0) and Ip(x0) ⊆
[c, d]. Then
(a) Ip(x0) is the maximal closed subinterval of [c, d] containing x0
on which f agrees with p;
(b) (ap(x0), bp(x0)) is the maximal open subinterval of [c, d]
containing x0 on which f agrees with p;
(c) The closed intervals Ip(x0) are either disjoint or identical.
To check assertion (c), assume Ip0(x0)∩Ip1(x1) ̸= ∅, where x0 ≤x1.
Clearly ap1(x1) ≤bp0(x0). If bp0(x0) = ap1(x1), then f agrees with p0
to the left of this value, and f agrees with p1 to the right of this value.
But then Lemma 38.6 shows p0 = p1, so the closed intervals involved
aren’t maximal. Therefore ap1(x1) < bp0(x0), and the polynomials p1
and p0 agree on the open interval (ap1(x1), bp0(x0)). Hence p0 = p1.
Now f agrees with p0 = p1 on the closed interval [ap0(x0), bp1(x1)],
so by maximality,
[ap0(x0), bp1(x1)] = [ap0(x0), bp0(x0)] = [ap1(x1), bp1(x1)].
Therefore Ip0(x0) = [ap0(x0), bp0(x0)] = [ap1(x1), bp1(x1)] = Ip1(x1),
and (c) holds.
Step 3. Our goal is to show all the closed intervals in Step 2 are the
same, i.e., all equal [c, d], which would prove the theorem. Assume, on
the contrary, that there exist x1, x2 in [c, d] and polynomials p1, p2 so
that Ip1(x1) ̸= Ip2(x2). We assume x1 < x2. Then bp1(x1) < ap2(x2)
and we will focus on [bp1(x1), ap2(x2)], which we will write as [b, a],
so
Ip1(x1) ̸= Ip2(x2)
and
[b, a] = [bp1(x1), ap2(x2)].
(1)
Consider the nondegenerate closed intervals from Step 2 that are
subintervals of (b, a). Since these intervals are disjoint, there are only

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 355
countably many of them. Moreover, there cannot be ﬁnitely many of
them, because if there were, there would be an open interval in (b, a)
that is disjoint from the ﬁnite union of them. By Step 1, there would
be another closed interval as described in Step 2, a contradiction.
We relabel the countably inﬁnite disjoint family of maximal open
intervals in Step 2, that are subsets of (b, a), by (ak, bk). Observe

k(ak, bk) is dense in [b, a]; otherwise there is a nonempty open in-
terval in [b, a] \ 
k(ak, bk) and by applying Step 1 we could expand
our family. Let K = [b, a] \ 
k(ak, bk), which is clearly closed. Let E
be the set of endpoints of the intervals [b, a] and all (ak, bk). Observe
that E ⊆K. Note that, by (1), b and a are right and left endpoints,
respectively, of maximal open intervals.
Step 4. In this step, we show that K is a perfect set, as deﬁned
in Discussion 21.10 on page 174, i.e., every point x in K is the limit
of a sequence of points in K \ {x}. Otherwise, for some x in K and
h > 0 we have K ∩(x −h, x + h) = {x}. The point x cannot be
both a left and a right endpoint in E, so we may assume, say, that
x is not a left endpoint in E. Then x ̸= a and we may suppose that
(x, x+h) ⊆(b, a). Since (x, x+h) intersects the dense set 
k[ak, bk],
we have (x, x + h) ∩[ak, bk] ̸= ∅for some k. Then ak < x + h and
x < bk. Since x ̸= ak, x is not in {ak} ∪(ak, bk) = [ak, bk). Since
x < bk, we have x < ak < x + h and ak belongs to (x, x + h). Thus
ak ∈K ∩(x, x + h), a contradiction. Thus K is perfect.
Step 5. In this step, we obtain a contradiction to our hypotheses
by showing there is x0 ∈K satisfying f (n)(x0) ̸= 0 for all n ≥0.
This will prove the theorem.
Claim 1. Let J be an open interval in [b, a] satisfying J ∩K ̸= ∅,
and consider an integer n ≥0. Then exists an x ∈J ∩K such that
f (n)(x) ̸= 0.
Assume that J is as speciﬁed, but that n0 satisﬁes f (n0)(x) = 0
for all x ∈J ∩K. We show by induction
f (n)(x) = 0
for
n ≥n0
and all
x ∈J ∩K.
(2)
Suppose (2) holds for some n ≥n0, and consider x ∈J ∩K. Since K
is perfect, there is a sequence (xk) in K \ {x} such that limk xk = x.

7. Capstone
356
Since J is open, we may suppose that all xk are also in J. Hence
f (n+1)(x) = lim
k→∞
f (n)(xk) −f (n)(x)
xk −x
= lim
k→∞
0 −0
xk −x = 0;
i.e., (2) holds for n + 1. By induction, we conclude that (2) holds as
stated.
On the other hand, if x ∈J \ K then x belongs to one of the
maximal open intervals (ak, bk). Since J ∩K ̸= ∅, there exists y in
J \ (ak, bk), so that y ≤ak or y ≥bk, say y ≥bk. Since x < bk
and J is an interval, J also contains bk. Thus bk belongs to J ∩K.
Let pk be the polynomial that agrees with f on (ak, bk). Since x
is in (ak, bk), we have f (j)(x) = p(j)
k (x) for all j ≥0. If pk is the
zero polynomial, then clearly f (n0)(x) = p(n0)
k
(x) = 0. Otherwise, let
nk be the degree of the polynomial pk, so that p(nk) is the nonzero
constant function p(nk)(bk). Since bk is in J ∩K, (2) implies that
nk < n0 and f (n0)(x) = p(n0)(x) = 0. Summarizing, f (n0)(x) = 0 for
all x in the open interval J, so f agrees with a polynomial on J by
Proposition 38.4 and J ⊆
k(ak, bk), contradicting J ∩K ̸= ∅. This
proves Claim 1.
Since each f (n) is continuous, Claim 1 implies:
Claim 2. If n ≥0 and J is an open interval in [b, a] satisfying
J ∩K ̸= ∅, then there is an open interval J′ so that J′ ⊆J, J′∩K ̸=
∅and f (n)(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈J′ ∩K.3
Applying Claim 2 to J = (b, a), we obtain an open interval J0 so
that J0 ∩K ̸= ∅and f(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈J0 ∩K. Repeated use of the
claim yields a sequence (Jn) of open intervals so that
J0 ⊇J1 ⊇J1 ⊇J2 ⊇J2 ⊇· · · ,
(3)
each Jn∩K ̸= ∅and f (n)(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈Jn∩K. Since 
n Jn∩K =

n Jn∩K ̸= ∅, by Theorem 13.10 there is x0 in K that belongs to all
the intervals Jn. Therefore f (n)(x0) ̸= 0 for all n ≥0; this completes
Step 5 and the proof of the theorem.
3The notation J′ represents the closure of the interval J′.

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 357
38.7 Corollary.
Suppose −∞< α < β < ∞. If f is continuous on [α, β], and if f
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 38.5 on (α, β), then f agrees with
a polynomial on [α, β].
Even though continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable functions are
plentiful, by Theorem 38.3, the next theorem shows every continuous
function on R is arbitrarily close to nice functions.
38.8 Theorem.
Given a continuous function f on R (bounded or not) and ϵ > 0,
there is a piecewise linear function4 g and a function ψ in C∞(R)
such that sup{|f(x) −g(x)| : x ∈R} < ϵ and sup{|f(x) −ψ(x)| : x ∈
R} < ϵ.
Proof
If you look at pictures of a couple of continuous functions f, as well
as f +ϵ and f −ϵ, as in Fig. 24.1 on page 195, you might conclude the
existence of such a piecewise linear function is obvious. The only ﬂaw
in this thinking is that, as we know, general continuous functions can
be quite complicated, and impossible to graph. For this reason, we
include a proof.
Step 1. If f is continuous on [a, b] and ϵ > 0, then there is a
piecewise linear function g on [a, b] satisfying sup{|f(x)−g(x)| : x ∈
[a, b]} < ϵ. To see this, we use uniform continuity of f to obtain δ > 0
so that
|s −t| < δ,
s, t ∈[a, b]
implies
|f(s) −f(t)| < ϵ
3.
Select a partition {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} of [a, b] with
mesh < δ. For each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, let ℓk be the linear function
satisfying ℓk(tk−1) = f(tk−1) and ℓk(tk) = f(tk). We write mk for
min{f(tk−1), f(tk)} and Mk for max{f(tk−1), f(tk)}. Then for x in
[tk−1, tk], we have
mk −ϵ
3 < f(x) < Mk + ϵ
3
and
Mk −mk < ϵ
3.
4A piecewise linear function on an interval is a continuous function that is linear
on subintervals.

7. Capstone
358
Thus f(x) lies between mk −ϵ
3 and mk + 2ϵ
3 . The same is true for
ℓk(x), and therefore
|f(x) −ℓk(x)| < ϵ
for
x ∈[tk−1, tk].
The function g on [a, b], deﬁned by g(x) = ℓk(x) for x in [tk−1, tk],
satisﬁes sup{|f(x) −g(x)| : x ∈[a, b]} < ϵ.
Step 2. Let ℓbe a linear function on an interval [a, b]. There is
a monotonic function ψ in C∞(R) so that ψ(a) = ℓ(a), ψ(b) = ℓ(b),
all derivatives of ψ at a and b are 0, and
|ψ(x) −ℓ(x)| ≤|ℓ(b) −ℓ(a)|
for all
x ∈[a, b].
(1)
We begin with the function h = h∗
a,b in Exercise 31.4 on page 267.
Then h(x) = 0 for x ≤a, h(x) = 1 for x ≥b, h is increasing on [a, b],
and all its derivative are 0 at a and at b. In fact,
h(x) =
f(x −a)
f(x −a) + f(b −x)
where f is the function in Example 3 and Fig. 31.1 on page 257. From
the quotient rule, and writing D for the denominator obtained using
the quotient rule, we see
h′(x) = [f(b −x)f ′(x −a) + f(x −a)f ′(b −x)]/D(x).
This is nonnegative, so h is increasing. By looking at the right-
hand derivatives of h at a, and the left-hand derivatives at b, we
see h(n)(a) = h(n)(b) = 0 for all n in N.5 Let
ψ(x) = ℓ(a) + [ℓ(b) −ℓ(a)] · h(x)
for
x ∈[a, b].
Condition (1) holds because, for x in [a, b], both ψ(x) and ℓ(x) lie
between ℓ(a) and ℓ(b).
Step 3. Given a piecewise linear function g on [a, b] and ϵ > 0,
there is a function ψ in C∞(R) so that ψ(a) = g(a), ψ(b) = g(b), all
derivatives of ψ at a and b are 0, and
sup{|ψ(x) −g(x)| : x ∈[a, b]} < ϵ.
(2)
5Regarding why h, the quotient of two inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions, also is
inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable, see Exercise 38.6.

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 359
As in Step 1, there is a partition {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b} of
[a, b] such that |g(tk) −g(tk−1)| < ϵ and such that g agrees on each
[tk−1, tk] with a linear function ℓk, k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Apply Step 2 to
each [tk−1, tk] to obtain a function ψk in C∞(R) so that ψk(tk−1) =
ℓk(tk−1) = g(tk−1) and similarly ψk(tk) = g(tk), all derivatives at
tk−1 and tk are 0, and
|ψk(x) −g(x)| ≤|ℓk(tk) −ℓk(tk−1)| < ϵ
for all
x ∈[tk−1, tk].
The desired ψ is deﬁned by ψ(x) = ψk(x) for x ∈[tk−1, tk], k =
1, 2, . . . , n.
Step 4. Consider a continuous function f on R and ϵ > 0. By
Step 1, for each k in Z, there is a piecewise linear function gk on the
interval [k, k + 1] satisfying
sup{|gk(x) −f(x)| : x ∈[k, k + 1]} < ϵ
3.
(3)
We apply Step 3 to each interval [k, k + 1] to obtain ψk in C∞(R) so
that ψk(k) = f(k), ψk(k + 1) = f(k + 1), all derivatives of ψk are 0
at k and k + 1, and
sup{|ψk(x) −gk(x)| : x ∈[k, k + 1]} < ϵ
3.
(4)
We obtain ψ in C∞(R) by deﬁning ψ(x) = ψk(x) for x in [k, k + 1],
k ∈Z. From (3) and (4) we conclude
sup{|ψ(x) −f(x)| : x ∈R} ≤2ϵ
3 < ϵ.
38.9 Corollary.
The space of all bounded piecewise linear functions and the space
C∞(R) ∩C(R) of all bounded inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions on R
are dense in C(R), using the distance d(f, g) = sup{|f(y) −g(y)| :
y ∈R} deﬁned prior to Theorem 38.3.
The next result is both a corollary to Theorem 38.8 and a lemma
for the next result.
38.10 Lemma.
Consider continuous f on [a, b], ϵ > 0, and a constant c > 0.
Then there is a piecewise linear function g on [a, b] such that

7. Capstone
360
sup{|f(x) −g(x)| : x ∈[a, b]} < ϵ and the absolute value of the
slope of each of its linear segments exceeds c.
Proof
Before continuing, you might wish to reread the ﬁrst paragraph of
the proof of Theorem 38.8. Since, by that theorem, it now suﬃces to
consider the case when f itself is a linear function ℓ, it will be easy
to see why this lemma is true.
It suﬃces to consider the case when ℓis increasing, and we may
assume c exceeds the slope of ℓ. There is a δ > 0 suﬃciently small
that one can replace any line segment from (x, ℓ(x)) to (x+δ, ℓ(x+δ))
by two line segments, one rising from (x, ℓ(x)), with slope exceeding
c, to the line ℓ+ ϵ
2, and the other dropping down to (x+δ, f(x+δ)),
at a slope less than −c. By replacing δ by a smaller δ, if necessary,
we may assume δ divides b −a. Then there is partition {t0 = a <
t1 < · · · < tn = b} of [a, b], with tk = tk−1 +δ for each k, so that each
line segment from (tk−1, ℓ(tk−1)) to (tk, ℓ(tk)) can be replaced by
two line segments each with slope exceeding c in absolute value. The
resulting piecewise linear function6 g on [a, b] is continuous because
it agrees with f = ℓat each tk, and it satisﬁes
sup{|g(x) −f(x)| : x ∈[a, b]} = ϵ
2 < ϵ.
This establishes the lemma.
We now return to continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable functions.
So far as we know, until 1992 the construction of such functions
has involved summing certain continuous functions, i.e., building
them up from simpler functions. The next construction, due to Mark
Lynch [44] in 1992, is quite diﬀerent, using some topology and no inﬁ-
nite series. Lynch starts with certain subsets of the plane and shrinks
them down to the graph of a continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable func-
tion. He uses Example 6 on page 171, which states that a function
on a compact subset of R is continuous if and only if its graph is
compact. Later Lynch [45] generalized his technique to construct
continuous functions that are diﬀerentiable only at the rationals.
6It is tempting to call this a “stegosaurus linear function.”

§38. * Continuous Nowhere-Diﬀerentiable Functions 361
Below, we simplify the technique in [45] just to obtain a continuous
nowhere-diﬀerentiable function.
38.11 Mark Lynch’s Construction.
Step 1. Let ℓbe a linear function on an interval [a, b]. Then its graph
L is a line segment in the plane. We assume the slope of ℓexceeds 2n
in absolute value. We will construct a (closed) rhomboid7 R about
L with the following property:
Property Rn: If f is a function on [a, b] and if the graph of
f is contained in R, then for each x ∈[a, b] there is y ∈[a, b]
such that x ̸= y and |f(y)−f(x)
y−x
| > n.
First, we suppose the slope exceeds 2n. Let m = a+b
2
be the midpoint
of the interval [a, b]. Then we have
ℓ(b) −ℓ(m)
b −a
= ℓ(m) −ℓ(a)
b −a
> n;
thus there exists ϵ > 0 so that
ℓ(b) −ϵ −[ℓ(m) + ϵ]
b −a
> n
and
ℓ(m) −ϵ −[ℓ(a) + ϵ]
b −a
> n.
(1)
The desired rhomboid R is bounded above and below by the graphs
of ℓ+ ϵ and ℓ−ϵ, and bounded on the left and right by the vertical
line segments connecting (x, ℓ(x) −ϵ) and (x, ℓ(x) + ϵ) for x = a and
for x = b. Consider x in [a, b]. If x ≤m, then using (1) we obtain
f(b) −f(x)
b −x
≥ℓ(b) −ϵ −[ℓ(x) + ϵ]
b −a
≥ℓ(b) −ϵ −[ℓ(m) + ϵ]
b −a
> n,
so Property Rn holds with y = b. If x ≥m, then
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
≥ℓ(x) −ϵ −[ℓ(a) + ϵ]
b −a
≥ℓ(m) −ϵ −[ℓ(a) + ϵ]
b −a
> n,
and Property Rn holds with y = a.
Now suppose the slope of ℓis less than −2n. Then use −ℓto
obtain a rhomboid R′ satisfying Property Rn. Let R = −R′. If the

graph of f is contained in R, then the graph of −f is contained in
R′, and Property Rn holds for −f and R′. So it holds for f and R.
Step 2. Now we construct a continuous nowhere-diﬀerentiable
function on [0, 1]. We begin with a piecewise linear function g1 on
[0, 1] such that the absolute value of the slope of each segment ex-
ceeds 2. Note g1 can be selected to be linear on [a, b], as illustrated
in Fig. 38.1, and observe the x and y axes are not drawn to scale.
Let C1 be the union of rhomboids surrounding the line segments of
g1, where each rhomboid satisﬁes Property Rn for n = 1. Then C1
satisﬁes the following property for n = 1.
Property n: If f is a function on [0, 1] and if the graph of f
is contained in Cn, then for each x ∈[0, 1] there is y ∈[0, 1]
such that 0 < |y −x| ≤1
n and



f(y)−f(x)
y−x



 > n.
For the inductive construction, suppose we have C1, . . . , Cn−1 sat-
isfying Cn−1 ⊆· · · ⊆C1, where each Ck is a union of rhomboids
satisfying Property k. By Lemma 38.10, there is a piecewise linear

Exercises 363
function gn on [0, 1] whose graph lies in the interior of Cn−1 such
that the absolute value of the slope of each segment exceeds 2n. By
breaking segments of gn into smaller segments, if necessary, we may
assume their domains, i.e., their projections onto the x-axis, each
have length ≤1
n. By Step 1, each such segment of gn is included in
a rhomboid satisfying Property Rn, with the additional conclusion
0 < |y −x| ≤1
n. Therefore Cn satisﬁes Property n. Moreover, since
the graph of gn lies in the interior of Cn−1, the construction in Step 1
shows (using a smaller ϵ if necessary) we can select the rhomboids
so that their union Cn is a subset of Cn−1 and so that the vertical
line segments in Cn have length ≤1
n.
Now let C = ∩∞
n=1Cn. Each set Cn is a closed and bounded
set in the plane, hence compact. By Theorem 13.10 on page 89, C
is compact and nonempty. Also, for each x in [0, 1], the sets {y ∈
[0, 1] : (x, y) ∈Cn} are compact and nonempty and, since the vertical
line segments in Cn have length ≤1
n, their intersection {y ∈[0, 1] :
(x, y) ∈C} has exactly one point. Thus C is the graph of a function f
on [0, 1]. Since its graph is compact, Example 6 on page 171 shows f is
continuous. Finally, consider x in [0, 1]. For each n, using Property n
we obtain yn in [0, 1] so that 0 < |yn −x| ≤1
n and



f(yn)−f(x)
yn−x



 > n.
Thus f is not diﬀerentiable at x.
Exercises

function by simply ﬁnding a suitably complicated Taylor series?

nowhere-diﬀerentiable function satisfying d(f, 1∗) < 1, where 1∗
denotes the constant function identically equal to 1 on R. Explain
why the reciprocal g of f is nowhere-diﬀerentiable on R.
38.6 In Exercise 31.4 it was noted, without proof, that the sum, product,
etc. of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions is again inﬁnitely diﬀeren-
tiable. Also, f/g is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable if both f and g are, and if
g never vanishes. Verify the last claim. Hint: Show the nth derivative
of f/g has the form hn/g2n where hn is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable.

Appendix on Set Notation
Consider a set S. The notation x ∈S means x is an element of
S; we might also say “x belongs to S” or “x is in S.” The notation
x /∈S signiﬁes x is some element but x does not belong to S. By
T ⊆S we mean each element of T also belongs to S, i.e., x ∈T
implies x ∈S. Thus we have 1 ∈N, 17 ∈N, −3 /∈N, 1
2 /∈N,

Small ﬁnite sets can be listed using braces {

{2, 3, 5, 7} is the four-element set consisting of the primes less than
10. Sets are often described by properties of their elements via the
notation
{

Before the colon the variable [n or x, for instance] is indicated and
after the colon the properties are given. For example,

“such that,” so the set in (1) is read “the set of all n such that n is

in N and n is odd.” Likewise
{x : x ∈R and 1 ≤x < 3}
(2)
represents the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to 1 and
less than 3. In §4 this set is abbreviated [1, 3). Note that 1 ∈[1, 3) but
3 /∈[1, 3). Just to streamline notation, the expressions (1) and (2)
may be written as
{n ∈N : n is odd}
and
{x ∈R : 1 ≤x < 3}.
The ﬁrst set is then read “the set of all n in N such that n is odd.”
Another way to list a set is to specify a rule for obtaining its
elements using some other set of elements. For example, {n2 : n ∈N}
represents the set of all positive integers that are the square of other
integers, i.e.,
{n2 : n ∈N} = {m ∈N : m = n2 for some n ∈N} = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .}.
Similarly {sin nπ
4 : n ∈N} represents the set obtained by evaluating
sin nπ
4 for each positive integer n. Actually this set is ﬁnite:

The set in (1) can also be written as {2n −1 : n ∈N}. One more
example: {x3 : x > 3} is the set of all cubes of all real numbers
bigger than 3 and of course equals {y ∈R : y > 27}, i.e., (27, ∞) in
the notation of §5.
For sets S and T, S \ T signiﬁes the set {x ∈S : x /∈T}. For
a sequence (An) of sets, the union ∪An and intersection ∩An are
deﬁned by

An = {x : x ∈An for at least one n},

An = {x : x ∈An for all n}.
The empty set ∅is the set with no elements at all. Thus, for example,
{n ∈N : 2 < n < 3} = ∅, {r ∈Q : r2 = 2} = ∅, {x ∈R : x2 <
0} = ∅, and [0, 2] ∩[5, ∞) = ∅.
For functions f and g, the notation f+g, fg, f◦g, etc. is explained
on page 128.
The end of a proof is indicated by a small black box. This replaces
the classical QED.

(a) A3 and A4 hold for a ∈N, but 0 and −a are not in N. Like-
wise M4 holds for a ∈N, but a−1 is not in N unless a = 1.
These three properties fail for N since they implicitly require
the numbers 0, −a and a−1 to be in the system under scrutiny,
namely N in this case.
(b) M4 fails in the sense discussed in (a).
3.3
(iv) Apply (iii), DL, A2, A4, (ii) and A4 again to obtain
(−a)(−b) + (−ab)=(−a)(−b) + (−a)b = (−a)[(−b) + b]
=(−a)[b + (−b)] = (−a) · 0 = 0 = ab + (−ab).
Now by (i) we conclude (−a)(−b) = ab.
(v) Suppose ac = bc and c ̸= 0. By M4 there exists c−1 such that
c · c−1 = 1. Now (supply reasons)
a = a·1 = a(c·c−1) = (ac)c−1 = (bc)c−1 = b(c·c−1) = b·1 = b.

−a ≤b.

Since sup S is an upper bound for S, we have sup S ≥s
for all s ∈S. Also sup S ∈S by assumption. Hence sup S is the
maximum of S, i.e., sup S = max S.
4.7
(a) Suppose S ⊆T. Since sup T ≥t for all t ∈T we obviously
have sup T ≥s for all s ∈S. So sup T is an upper bound for
the set S. Hence sup T is ≥the least upper bound for S, i.e.,
sup T ≥sup S. A similar argument shows inf T ≤inf S; give it.
(b) Since S ⊆S ∪T, sup S ≤sup(S ∪T) by (a). Similarly
sup T ≤sup(S ∪T), so max{sup S, sup T} ≤sup(S ∪T). Since
sup(S ∪T) is the least upper bound for S ∪T, we will have
equality here provided we show: max{sup S, sup T} is an up-
per bound for the set S ∪T. This is easy. If x ∈S, then
x ≤sup S ≤max{sup S, sup T} and if x ∈T, then x ≤
sup T ≤max{sup S, sup T}. That is, x ≤max{sup S, sup T}
for all x ∈S ∪T.
4.9
(1) If s ∈S, then −s ∈−S, so −s ≤s0. Hence we have s ≥−s0
by Theorem 3.2(i).
(2) Suppose t ≤s for all s ∈S. Then −t ≥−s for all s ∈S, i.e.,
−t ≥x for all x ∈−S. So −t is an upper bound for the set −S.
So −t ≥sup(−S). That is, −t ≥s0 and hence t ≤−s0.
4.11 Proof By 4.7 there is a rational r1 such that a < r1 < b. By 4.7
again, there is a rational r2 such that a < r2 < r1. We continue by
induction: If rationals r1, . . . , rn have been selected so that a < rn <
rn−1 < · · · < r2 < r1, then 4.7 applies to a < rn to yield a rational
rn+1 such that a < rn+1 < rn. This process yields an inﬁnite set
{r1, r2, . . .} in Q ∩(a, b).

Alternative Proof Assume Q∩(a, b) is ﬁnite. The set is nonempty
by 4.7. Let c = min(Q ∩(a, b)). Then a < c, so by 4.7 there is a
rational r such that a < r < c. Then r belongs to Q∩(a, b), so c ≤r,
a contradiction.

8.3 Discussion. We want √sn < ϵ or sn < ϵ2. But sn →0, so we can get
sn < ϵ2 for large n.
Formal Proof
Let ϵ > 0. Since ϵ2 > 0 and lim sn = 0, there exists
N so that |sn −0| < ϵ2 for n > N. Thus sn < ϵ2 for n > N, so
√sn < ϵ for n > N. That is, |√sn −0| < ϵ for n > N. We conclude
lim √sn = 0.

(a) Let ϵ > 0. Our goal is to show s −ϵ < sn < s + ϵ for large

n > N1
implies
s −ϵ < an.
(1)
Likewise there exists N2 so that |bn −s| < ϵ for n > N2, so
n > N2
implies
bn < s + ϵ.

Now
n > max{N1, N2}
implies
s −ϵ < an ≤sn ≤bn < s + ϵ;
hence |s −sn| < ϵ.

n is a multiple of 6; substituting these values in the inequality
gives |1 −a| < 1 and | −1 −a| < 1. By the triangle inequality
2 = |(1 −a) −(−1 −a)| ≤|1 −a| + | −1 −a| < 1 + 1 = 2,
a contradiction.
(b) Assume lim(−1)nn = a. Then there exists N such that n > N
implies |(−1)nn −a| < 1. For an even n > N and for n + 2 this
tells us |n−a| < 1 and |n+2−a| < 1. So 2 = |n+2−a−(n−a)| ≤
|n + 2 −a| + |n −a| < 2, a contradiction.

2. The second equality is justiﬁed by The-

Similarly lim(b2

(c) Parts (a) and (b) take care of the inﬁnite limits, so assume
(sn) and (tn) converge. Since tn −sn ≥0 for all n > N0,

(a) Discussion. Let M > 0 and let m = inf{tn : n ∈N}. We want

n > N.
(b) Hint: If lim tn > −∞, then inf{tn : n ∈N} > −∞. Use part (a).

Suppose a > 1. Then

a < 1, so lim(1/a)n = 0 as above. Thus
lim 1/an = 0. Theorem 9.10 [with sn = an] now shows lim an = +∞.

Suppose a ≤−1 and assume lim an exists. For even n, an ≥1 and
for odd n, an ≤−1. Clearly lim an = +∞and lim an = −∞are

of sup A = lim inf sn. Consider N in N and observe uN =
inf{sn : n > N} is a number in A, since {n ∈N : sn < uN} ⊆
{1, 2, . . . , N}. So uN ≤sup A for all N and consequently lim inf sn =
lim uN ≤sup A.
Next consider a ∈A. Let N0 = max{n ∈N : sn < a} < ∞. Then
sn ≥a for n > N0. Thus for N ≥N0 we have uN = inf{sn :
n > N} ≥a. It follows that lim inf sn = lim uN ≥a. We have just
shown that lim inf sn is an upper bound for the set A. Therefore
lim inf sn ≥sup A.

13.11 Suppose E is compact, hence closed and bounded by Theorem 13.12.
Consider a sequence (xn) in E. By Theorem 13.5, a subsequence of
(xn) converges to some x in Rk. Since E is closed, x must be in E;
see Proposition 13.9(b).
Suppose every sequence in E has a subsequence converging to a
point in E. By Theorem 13.12, it suﬃces to show E is closed and
bounded. If E were unbounded, E would contain a sequence (xn)
where lim d(xn, 0) = +∞and then no subsequence would converge
at all. Thus E is bounded. If E were nonclosed, then by Proposi-
tion 13.9 there would be a convergent sequence (xn) in E such that
x = lim xn ̸∈E. Since every subsequence would also converge to
x ̸∈E, we would have a contradiction.

(a) We are given f(x) = cos x and g(x) = x4 [p = 4] are continu-
ous. So g ◦f is continuous by Theorem 17.5, i.e., the function
g ◦f(x) = cos4 x is continuous. Obviously the function iden-
tically 1 is continuous [if you do not ﬁnd this obvious, check
it]. Hence 1 + cos4 x is continuous by Theorem 17.4(i). Finally
loge(1 + cos4 x) is continuous by Theorem 17.5 since this is
h ◦k(x) where k(x) = 1 + cos4 x and h(x) = loge x.
(b) Since we are given sin x and x2 are continuous, Theorem 17.5
shows sin2 x is continuous. Similarly, cos6 x is continuous. Hence
sin2 x + cos6 x is continuous by Theorem 17.4(i). Since sin2 x +
cos6 x > 0 for all x and since xπ is given to be continuous for
x > 0, we use Theorem 17.5 again to conclude [sin2 x+cos6 x]π
is continuous.
(e) We are given sin x and cos x are continuous at each x ∈R. So
Theorem 17.4(iii) shows
sin x
cos x = tan x is continuous wherever

Now assume
if (xn) is monotonic in dom(f) and lim xn = x0,
then lim f(xn) = f(x0),
(1)
but f is discontinuous at x0. Then by Deﬁnition 17.1, there exists
a sequence (xn) in dom(f) such that lim xn = x0 but (f(xn)) does
not converge to f(x0). Negating Deﬁnition 17.1, we see there exists
ϵ > 0 such that
for each N there is n > N satisfying |f(xn) −f(x0)| ≥ϵ.
(2)
It is easy to use (2) to obtain a subsequence (xnk) of (xn) such that
|f(xnk) −f(x0)| ≥ϵ

k.
(3)
Now Theorem 11.4 shows (xnk) has a monotonic subsequence (xnkj ).
By (1) we have limj→∞f(xnkj ) = f(x0), but by (3) we have
|f(xnkj ) −f(x0)| ≥ϵ for all j, a contradiction.
17.13 (a) Hint: Let x ∈R. Select a sequence (xn) such that lim xn =
x, xn is rational for even n, and xn is irrational for odd n.
Then f(xn) is 1 for even n and 0 for odd n, so (f(xn)) cannot
converge.
17.15 We abbreviate
(i) f is continuous at x0,
(ii) lim f(xn) = f(x0) for every sequence (xn) in dom(f) \ {x0}
converging to x0.
From Deﬁnition 17.1 it is clear that (i) implies (ii). Assume (ii)
holds but (i) fails. As in the solution to Exercise 17.11, there is a
sequence (xn) in dom(f) and an ϵ > 0 such that lim xn = x0 and
|f(xn) −f(x0)| ≥ϵ for all n. Obviously xn ̸= x0 for all n, i.e., (xn)
is in dom(f) \ {x0}. The existence of this sequence contradicts (ii).
18.3 This exercise was deliberately poorly stated, as if f must have a
maximum and minimum on [0, 5); see the comments following The-
orem 18.1. The minimum of f on [0, 5) is 1 = f(0) = f(3), but f has
no maximum on [0, 5) though sup{f(x) : x ∈[0, 5)} = 21.

f is continuous, Theorem 18.2 shows it suﬃces to show f(x) < 0
for some x and f(x) > 0 for some other x. This is true because

|a0 +a1x+· · ·+an−1xn−1| ≤(|a0|+|a1|+· · ·+|an−1|)|x|n−1 < |x|n,
so the number in brackets in (1) is positive. Now if x > c, then
xn > 0, so f(x) > 0. And if x < −c, then xn < 0 [why?], so
f(x) < 0.

(c) This is tricky, but it turns out that f is uniformly contin-
uous on R. A simple modiﬁcation of Exercise 19.7(a) shows
it suﬃces to show f is uniformly continuous on [1, ∞) and
(−∞, −1]. This can be done using Theorem 19.6. Note we
cannot apply Theorem 19.6 on R because f is not diﬀerentiable
at x = 0; also f ′ is not bounded near x = 0.
19.11 As in the solution to Exercise 19.9(c), it suﬃces to show ˜h is

f(x) = limx→0 f(x) = 1.
20.5 Let S = (0, ∞). Then f(x) = 1 for all x ∈S. So for any sequence
(xn) in S we have lim f(xn) = 1. It follows that limx→0S f(x) =
limx→∞S f(x) = 1, i.e., limx→0+ f(x) = limx→∞f(x) = 1. Like-
wise if S = (−∞, 0), then limx→0S f(x) = limx→−∞S f(x) = −1,
so limx→0−f(x) = limx→−∞f(x) = −1. Theorem 20.10 shows
limx→0 f(x) does not exist.
20.7 If (xn) is a sequence in (0, ∞) and lim xn = +∞, then lim(1/xn)

lim(2 −xn)−3 = 0, and hence (1) holds.
Now consider a sequence (xn) in (2, ∞) such that lim xn = 2. We

lim(xn −2)−3 = +∞.

Since lim(xn −2) = 0 and each xn −2 > 0, Theorem 9.10 shows

Suppose L1 = limx→aS f(x) exists with S = (a, b1), and consider a

E or F, say y ∈E. Since x ∈E ∩U1 and y ∈E ∩U2, these
sets are nonempty. Thus U1 and U2 separate E, and E is not
connected, a contradiction.
(b) No such example exists in R [why?], but many exist in the
plane.
22.9 Discussion. Given ϵ > 0, we need δ > 0 so that
s, t ∈R
and
|s −t| < δ
imply
d(F(s), F(t)) < ϵ.
(1)
Now
d(F(s), F(t)) = sup{|sf(x) + (1 −s)g(x) −tf(x) −(1 −t)g(x)| : x ∈S}
= sup{|sf(x) −tf(x) −sg(x) + tg(x)| : x ∈S}
≤|s −t| · sup{|f(x)| + |g(x)| : x ∈S}.
Since f and g are ﬁxed, the last supremum is a constant M. We may
assume M > 0, in which case δ =
ϵ
M will make (1) hold.

22.11 (a) Let (fn) be a convergent sequence in E. By Proposition 13.9(b),
it suﬃces to show f = lim fn is in E. For each x ∈S,
|f(x)| ≤|f(x) −fn(x)| + |fn(x)| ≤d(f, fn) + 1.
Since lim d(f, fn) = 0, we have |f(x)| ≤1.

(a) Since |an| ≥1 for inﬁnitely many n, we have sup{|an|1/n :

R = 1
β ≤1.
(b) Select c so that 0 < c < lim sup |an|. Then sup{|an| : n >

property that |ank| > c for all k. Since |ank|1/nk > (c)1/nk and
limk→∞c1/nk = 1 [by Theorem 9.7(d)], Theorem 12.1 shows
lim sup |ank|1/nk ≥1. It follows that β = lim sup |an|1/n ≥1

β ≤1.

(a) Obviously lim fn(0) = 0. Consider 0 < x < 1 and let sn =

|fN+1(x)| ≤M for x ∈S], then M + 1 bounds |f| on S [why?].
25.7 Let gn(x) = n−2 cos nx. Then we have |gn(x)| ≤n−2 for x ∈R and

(b) One can show directly that the sequence of partial sums

25.15 (a) Note fn(x) ≥0 for all x and n. Assume (fn) does not converge
to 0 uniformly on [a, b]. Then there exists ϵ > 0 such that
for each N there exists n > N and x ∈[a, b]
such that fn(x) ≥ϵ.
(1)
We claim
for each n ∈N there is xn ∈[a, b] where fn(xn) ≥ϵ.
(2)
If not, there is n0 ∈N such that fn0(x) < ϵ for all x ∈[a, b].
Since (fn(x)) is decreasing for each x, we conclude fn(x) < ϵ
for all x ∈[a, b] and n ≥n0. This clearly contradicts (1). We
have now established the hint.
Now by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the sequence (xn)
given by (2) has a convergent subsequence (xnk): xnk →x0.
Since lim fn(x0) = 0, there exists m such that fm(x0) < ϵ.
Since xnk
→
x0 and fm is continuous at x0, we have
limk→∞fm(xnk) = fm(x0) < ϵ. So there exists K such that
k > K
implies
fm(xnk) < ϵ.
If k > max{K, m}, then nk ≥k > m, so
fnk(xnk) ≤fm(xnk) < ϵ.
But fn(xn) ≥ϵ for all n, so we have a contradiction.

b−a . Let pn = qn ◦φ−1. Then each pn is a

(a) Assume a polynomial p satisﬁes |p(x)−sin x| < 1 for all x ∈R.

then p is unbounded on R and the same is true for p(x)−sin x,

f ′(a) = lim
x→a(x2/3 + a1/3x1/3 + a2/3)−1 = (3a2/3)−1 = 1
3a−2/3
for a ̸= 0.
(c) f is not diﬀerentiable at x = 0 since the limit limx→0 x1/3/x
does not exist as a real number. The limit does exist and equals
+∞, which reﬂects the geometric fact that the graph of f has
a vertical tangent at (0, 0).
28.5
(c) Let
h(x) = g(f(x)) −g(f(0))
f(x) −f(0)
.
According to Deﬁnition 20.3(a), for limx→0 h(x) to be mean-
ingful, h needs to be deﬁned on J \ {0} for some open interval
J containing 0. But the calculation in (b) shows h is undeﬁned
at (πn)−1 for n = ±1, ±2, . . ..
28.7 (d) f ′ is continuous on R, but f ′ is not diﬀerentiable at x = 0.
28.9 (b) f(x) = x4 + 13x and g(y) = y7. Then
h′(x) = g′(f(x)) · f ′(x) = 7(x4 + 13x)6 · (4x3 + 13).
28.11 With the stated hypotheses, h ◦g ◦f is diﬀerentiable at a and (h ◦

diﬀerentiable at a and (g ◦f)′(a) = g′(f(a)) · f ′(a). Again by 28.4,
(h ◦(g ◦f))′(a) = h′((g ◦f)(a)) · (g ◦f)′(a).
28.13 There exist positive numbers δ1 and ϵ so that f is deﬁned on the
interval (a −δ1, a + δ1) and g is deﬁned on (f(a) −ϵ, f(a) + ϵ). By
Theorem 17.2, there exists δ2 > 0 so that
x ∈dom(f)
and
|x −a| < δ2
imply
|f(x) −f(a)| < ϵ.
If |x −a| < min{δ1, δ2}, then x ∈dom(f) and |f(x) −f(a)| < ϵ, so
f(x) ∈dom(g), i.e., x ∈dom(g ◦f).

(a) Apply Mean Value Theorem to [0, 2].
(b) By the Mean Value Theorem, f ′(y) = 0 for some y ∈(1, 2).

values between 0 and 1
2.
29.5 For any a ∈R we have | f(x)−f(a)
x−a
| ≤|x−a|. It follows easily that f ′(a)
exists and equals 0 for all a ∈R. So f is constant by Corollary 29.4.
29.7
(a) Applying 29.4 to f ′, we ﬁnd f ′(x) = a for some constant a. If
g(x) = f(x) −ax, then g′(x) = 0 for x ∈I, so by 29.4 there is
a constant b such that g(x) = b for x ∈I.
29.9 Hint: Let f(x) = ex −ex for x ∈R. Use f ′ to show f is increasing
on [1, ∞) and decreasing on (−∞, 1]. Hence f takes its minimum at
x = 1.
29.13 Let h(x) = g(x) −f(x) and show h(x) ≥0 for x ≥0.
29.15 As in Example 2, let g(x) = x1/n. Since dom(g) = [0, ∞) if n is even
and dom(g) = R if n is odd, we have dom(g) = dom(h) ∪{0}. Also
h = gm. Use the Chain Rule to calculate h′(x).
29.17 Suppose f(a) = g(a). Then
lim
x→a+
h(x) −h(a)
x −a
= g′(a)
and
lim
x→a−
h(x) −h(a)
x −a
= f ′(a).
(1)
If also f ′(a) = g′(a), then Theorem 20.10 shows h′(a) exists and, in
fact, h′(a) = f ′(a) = g′(a).
Now suppose h is diﬀerentiable at a. Then h is continuous at a and
so f(a) = limx→a−f(x) = limx→a−h(x) = h(a) = g(a). Hence (1)
holds. But the limits in (1) both equal h′(a), so f ′(a) = g′(a).

A Guide to the References
There are many books with goals similar to ours, including: Bran-
nan [12], Clark [16], and Pedrick [51]. Zorn [73] is a gentle, well
written introduction with a strong ﬁrst chapter on “numbers, sets
and proofs.” Lay [41] also starts with sections on logic and proofs,
and provides good answers. Abbott [1] appears to be a ﬁne book,
though lots of the text is left to the exercises. Bauldry [3] is a nice
book designed for a last course in real analysis for those intending
to go into teaching. Morgan [47] gives a concise introduction to the
key concepts.
Beardon [6] gives a coherent treatment of limits by deﬁning the
notion just once, in terms of directed sets. Bressoud [13] is a wonder-

Selected Hints and Answers 395
ful book that introduces analysis through its history. Gardiner [23]
is a more challenging book, though the subject is at the same level;
there is a lot about numbers and there is a chapter on geometry.
Hijab [32] is another interesting, idiosyncratic and challenging book.
Note many of these books do not provide answers to some of the
exercises, though [32] provides answers to all of the exercises.
Rotman [61] is a very nice book that serves as an intermediate
course between the standard calculus sequence and the ﬁrst course in
both abstract algebra and real analysis. I always shared Rotman’s
doubts about inﬂicting logic on undergraduates, until I saw Wolf’s
wonderful book [70] that introduces logic as a mathematical tool in
an interesting way.
More encyclopedic real analysis books that are presented at the
same level with great detail and numerous examples are: Lewin and
Lewin [43], Mattuck [46] and Reed [56]. I ﬁnd Mattuck’s book [46]
very thoughtfully written; he shares many of his insights (acquired
over many years) with the reader.
There are several superb texts at a more sophisticated level:
Beals [4], Bear [5], Hoﬀman [33], Johnsonbaugh and Pfaﬀen-
berger [34], Protter and Morrey [53], Rudin [62] and Stromberg [65].
Any of these books can be used to obtain a really thorough
understanding of analysis and to prepare for various advanced
graduate-level topics in analysis. The possible directions for study
after this are too numerous to enumerate here. However, a reader
who has no speciﬁc needs or goals but who would like an introduc-
tion to several important ideas in several branches of mathematics
would enjoy and proﬁt from Garding [24].
