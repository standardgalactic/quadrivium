About the Author
Adam Griffith has been role playing for 28 years and using the GURPS
system almost exclusively in the last 10. When not gaming, Adam works as a
research scientist in a lab specializing in cystic fibrosis. He lives in Bothell,
Washington, with his lovely wife, two cats, and his newly adopted son.
Bjoern-Erik Hartsfvang got his start in role playing in 1980 and GMed his first
campaign in 1982. He was introduced to GURPS in 1987 and began GMing in it
in 1988. Over the years, his biggest gripe has been that he has spent so much
time GMing that he hasn’t gotten to play as much as he would like, but now
that he’s “time-sharing” the GMing with Adam and Stuart, he’s now getting to
play about 66% of the time. YEAH!!! When he’s not gaming, Bjoern is a profes-
sional astrologer, freelance writer, and educator, and volunteers for waaaay
too many charitable organizations. Bjoern lives in Redmond, Washington,
with a dog, a cat, and a soul-mate.
Stuart J. Stuple got involved with gaming when Bjoern and he first were get-
ting to know each other over 15 years ago. He has a master’s degree in psy-
chology and thinks GURPS does a better job of describing human beings in
terms of their infinite variety of skills and personality than any textbook or
theory. Over the years, he’s come to appreciate the various forms of cam-
paigns (dungeon crawls, puzzle campaigns, heroic adventures) and to love
them all. Playing is like being in a book in which you get to play a character
you’ve crafted and contribute to the plot line; GMing is like crafting that over-
all story arc and making sure the plot advances. These days he spends most
of his time living and working in the software industry as a program manager
in Redmond, Washington.


Dedication
To our gaming group — Bobbi (Ysabet/Teddy/Siobhan), Erynn
(Allira/Janoz/Sussharn), Herb (Rafe/Lady Stephanie/Rei), Katrina
(Jessenia/Kieran/Miranda), and Michael (Felicity/First Daughter/Frederick
Mercury) and numerous others over the years — thanks for letting us try out
our ideas and for all of the many adventures. We thank you. (Do you realize
we are each someone else’s brother, sister, or wife throughout those worlds
[Avonlea/Lanka/Castle F]?)
—Adam (Iff/Erica and Eryka/GM), Bjoern (GM/Anduril/Sheriff Dr. Erasmus),
and Stuart (Harmonie/GM/Myryk). 
Adam Griffith: To Ruth, who put up with me sitting at the computer for
hours on end muttering to myself. And to my cats Buster and Spooky, who
made writing ever so much more challenging by talking to me and walking
on the keyboard while I was trying to work.
Bjoern-Erik Hartsfvang: To Jacqueline Aranté for giving me the confidence
to write despite the knives in the chest. And thanks to Marcus Evenstar for
introducing me to GURPS in the first place.
Stuart J. Stuple: To Mary B. and Melody for giving me the opportunity to
write again — and even better, to write about something a lot more fun than
software.

Introduction
S
o, you want to be a wizard, do you, punk?
Or would you rather be a tough cop on the mean streets of San Francisco?
How about an Amazon princess, a stalwart warrior, or a crafty thief? Are you
interested in a career as a Cosmic Ranger, fighting lawlessness in the Outer
Asteroid Colonies? Are you intrigued by the idea of being a private detective
in a world where the shadow of Lovecraftian horror lurks in the spaces
between the corners? This is just the smallest sampling of the types of char-
acters you can play in GURPS, the Generic Universal RolePlaying System by
Steve Jackson Games.
Role playing games have been on the market in one form or another for over
30 years, and gamers have many different systems to choose from. As avid
gamers with over 50 years of experience under our collective belts, we’ve
believed for years that GURPS is undisputedly the best role playing game
system in existence. With the recent release of the fourth edition, GURPS has
become even better, more sophisticated, and more adaptable to whatever
game milieu you feel drawn toward.
About This Book
We love GURPS; it is the only role playing game that any of us has played 
in — or been the Game Master for — over the ten years that we have been
gaming together. In writing GURPS For Dummies, we brought our collective
experience as players and as Game Masters (GMs) to bear to give you as
comprehensive a view of GURPS as we could. Each of the three of us has a
fundamentally different role playing style — both as players and as GMs —
and by collaborating on this book, we’re able to provide you with three very
different viewpoints about GURPS and the ways we’ve found to make the
most of the system. However, everything that we’ve included in this book is
information that all three of us have agreed upon, so you won’t be stuck in
the middle of any mundane arguments about the minutiae of GURPS rules.
We also wrote GURPS For Dummies to be a resource that any GURPS afi-
cionado will find interesting and can benefit from reading. Whether you’re

2
GURPS For Dummies 
brand new to role playing or are as tenured as we are, you’re going to find
information here that challenges your assumptions about GURPS and gets
your creative juices flowing. We hope that this book gives you insights into
how to be a stronger player and a more valuable member of your party. If you
are a GM, you can find information that may help you create campaigns that
are more richly textured for the players and more consistent, more enjoyable,
and more memorable for everyone.
We didn’t write GURPS For Dummies to explain the rules of GURPS to you;
there’s another book on the market that does that much better than we ever
could. It’s called GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition. Our approach to GURPS For
Dummies is to provide you with advice about the choices that GURPS
demands gamers make — from the rawest newbie to the hoariest GM — from
character creation to playing in an adventure to moving into GMing.
Why You Need This Book
In our oh-so-humble opinions, GURPS is more sophisticated, more versatile,
and capable of more depth than any other role playing game in existence.
What other gaming system gives you the ability to play a Cro-Magnon cave-
person in one campaign, an ultra-sophisticated space traveler in another cam-
paign, and the most feared wizard on two coasts in yet a third campaign — all
using the same fundamental set of rules?
However, along with being so wonderful, GURPS can be a bit daunting. It
demands that its players actually think during the adventure, rather than 
only consult the results of a series of dice rolls. And each character is a truly
unique creation that requires the creating player to make numerous strategic
decisions, not only during character creation, but also as play progresses.
GURPS introduced the concept of role playing as shared storytelling between the
Game Master and the players. GURPS is designed with the concept that, if the
GM is running an ongoing campaign, each adventure and each scenario should
fit into the overall plot of that campaign and be more than merely a loosely con-
nected series of “dungeon crawls” with no purpose other than the personal
enrichment of the player characters. This makes gaming not only more emo-
tionally satisfying and enriching, but more challenging for everyone involved.
Finally, with the release of the much-anticipated GURPS, Fourth Edition, much
of what was once familiar and commonplace has undergone substantial and
dramatic changes. To write this book, the three of us spent literally months
combing through the new rules to get a handle on what has changed, what
has remained the same, and how it all affects the way the game is played. Few
people — and especially few overworked and harassed Game Masters —
have the luxury to spend this kind of time in order to unlearn and relearn
GURPS in its new manifestation. But that’s okay; we did it for you, and
throughout this book we’ve noted key changes in the system.

We were well aware of all these issues when we wrote GURPS For Dummies
and integrated our opinions about the rule changes throughout the text. 
For example, the official material from Steve Jackson Games describes the
specifics of each advantage and disadvantage, but nowhere does it provide you
with an analysis of the relative impact of taking a specific advantage or disad-
vantage as compared to others. You can find that information in this book.
We’d like you to think of GURPS For Dummies as a companion to GURPS Basic
Set — as a resource that not only helps walk you through some nuts-and-
bolts activities, like creating your player character, but also gives you a con-
textual framework for integrating all the different aspects of your character
into a coherent whole. This means that you can get a handle on the personali-
ties and abilities of your player characters (and nonplayer characters [NPCs]
in the case of GMs) much earlier and be able to play at a much higher level
than you would otherwise.
How to Use This Book
How should you use this book? Any way you want. You are more than wel-
come to read it from cover to cover, but each chapter was written to stand
alone and be read independently of any of the others. How you can best use
this book depends on what you need at a particular moment.
How This Book Is Organized
GURPS For Dummies is organized into six specific parts. Each of the first five
parts focuses on one general topic of gaming in GURPS, with the individual
chapters of that part focusing on specific components of that topic. The sixth
part, The Part of Tens, appears in every For Dummies book, and GURPS For
Dummies continues the tradition.
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS
Unless the GM just hands him a completed character sheet, everyone who
plays GURPS gets his introduction to the system by creating his first player
character (PC). It is an excellent way of becoming acquainted with the system,
learning the underlying logic, and figuring out how to create a distinct per-
sonality for each PC. This part addresses the parts of character creation that
are common to every character, regardless of milieu, specifically focusing on
character role (Chapter 2), attributes (Chapter 3), advantages (Chapter 4),
disadvantages (Chapter 5), and skills (Chapter 6).

Introduction

Part II: Enhancing Your Character
One of the neat things about GURPS is the variety of ways that you can
enhance a character. This refers to giving a character one or more specialized
abilities — most of which fall outside the scope of what ordinary mortal
humans can accomplish. Part II addresses the different ways that characters
can be enhanced during the character-creation process, with each category
(magic, powers, technology, and race) of enhancement being addressed in a
separate chapter.
Part III: Playing with Your Character
Playing a character in GURPS is one thing; playing a character well can be
something entirely different. Like most other parts of life, running a GURPS
player character is not as simple as it looks, and all players should learn
some specific skills to improve their ability to run their characters. In this
part, we address three specific issues: engaging in combat, keeping adequate
records, and role playing a character’s personality. We find that players who
can master these three skills quickly become superior players.
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure
Eventually, most gamers want to try their hand at being the Game Master and
running an adventure — if not an entire campaign. Some of these people —
after only a single experience — run off screaming into the night, vowing
never to GM again. This is a shame, and we wrote Part IV to try and help new
(and not-so-new) GMs manage all the complexities of GMing in GURPS with-
out strain or stress. This includes topics like creating a simple adventure,
reviewing the players’ characters to make sure they’re suitable for your
adventure, and even creating an electronic spreadsheet to manage the flow 
of information in your campaign.
Part V: Building Your Own World
Some GMs are satisfied just running simple adventures, others are quite
happy to buy a campaign module that provides them with all the information
necessary to run a campaign. Then there are those people who insist on setting
up a campaign and adventure scenarios within a game world of their own cre-
ation. Yes, these people need help, but not the kind you are probably thinking.
Creating a game world doesn’t have to consume your every waking hour. In this
part, we walk you through a series of decisions that any world-designer has to
make — eventually. If you are playing in a campaign but not GMing, you may
want to get permission from your GM before reading anything in this part.

GURPS For Dummies 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The five chapters in this part each list and describe our votes for the ten (or
thereabouts) “best” choices in a particular category. For example, Chapter 24
is “Ten Disadvantages That Aren’t Too Painful,” and Chapter 22 is “Ten Rules
for Spending Points.”
Icons Used in This Book
Whenever a particular paragraph says something that we want you to pay
close attention to, it has one of the following icons in the margin so it can be
quickly located:
We use the Tip to point out a really cool technique or process that is either
much quicker, much easier, or gives a much better result than the “normal”
way of doing it.
Sometimes we include information about a topic that we think GMs in partic-
ular ought to pay very close attention to.
We use this icon to emphasize a rule that has substantially or dramatically
changed since the third edition of GURPS.
This icon indicates that you can find more information about what we’re dis-
cussing in GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition.
Remember these important nuggets, and you’ll be a better player or GM.
The bomb tells you that something tricky is afoot. If you aren’t careful with
the information we give you, it could blow up in your face.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
In order to play GURPS, you need much more than just our humble volume;
you also need the actual rule books published by Steve Jackson Games. If 
you don’t have it already, at the very least you need to get GURPS Basic Set:
Characters. GMs really ought to have it, but we also recommend that players
get the second basic-set volume, GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns, as well. If the
campaign has magic, then the GM and the players of mage characters need
GURPS Magic; if other paranormal abilities are desired, these are addressed in
GURPS Powers (not yet released as of December 1, 2005). GURPS Martial Arts
is expected sometime in 2006. Please be sure to get the books for fourth-edition
GURPS, rather than the out-dated third-edition volumes of the same name.
In addition, Steve Jackson Games has already released a number of world-
books and genre books for the fourth edition. Currently, GURPS Infinite
Worlds, Banestorm, and Fantasy are available. More are forthcoming, perhaps
even by the time this book finds its way into your hands. If you’re a GM and
you don’t want to go to all the work of creating your own universe, a world-
book is a vital resource. Even if you are creating your own reality, worldbooks
are very reasonable investments; nothing is stopping you from lifting what-
ever you like out of a worldbook and inserting it into your own cosmology.
Steve Jackson Games runs a Web site that is a warehouse of online resources
for GMs and players, including character templates, reference materials, and
GM resources. We recommend you check it out; go to e23.sjgames.com.

GURPS For Dummies 

Part I
Getting Started
with GURPS

In this part . . .
W
e do exactly as the title says; we get you started.
Chapter 1 gives you an overview of role playing
and introduces you to GURPS. Most of this material is
pretty standard regardless of which gaming system you
use, but some of the material in this chapter specifically
addresses the strength of the generic qualities of GURPS.
We don’t believe in beating around the bush — in Chap-
ter 2 we get you thinking about what sort of character you
want to play in a GURPS campaign so that, in Chapter 3,
we can help you determine your character’s attributes
(the scores used to determine a character’s physical and
mental capabilities). In Chapter 4, we discuss the different
advantages (innate abilities, like an aptitude for math or
the ability to work magic).
GURPS uses disadvantages (physical, mental, or social
weaknesses or flaws that your character might possess) to
give you more character points (which are what you use to
purchase attributes, advantages, and skills) to work with,
but disadvantages also are the fundamental components 
of your character’s unique personality, and Chapter 5 gets
you working on determining the disadvantages you want to
incorporate into your character.
Finally, in Chapter 6, we guide you through the process of
determining what specific skills your character possesses;
for example, if you envision playing a cat burglar, you really
ought to have the skills of Stealth, Lockpicking, Traps, and
Streetwise — and quite a few more — unless you want 
to play either an incompetent cat burglar or a cat burglar
in jail.

Introducing GURPS — 
The Generic Universal 
RolePlaying System
In This Chapter
 Discovering the various parts of a role playing system
 Assembling what you need before setting off on a GURPS adventure
 Getting an overview of the game mechanics
R
ole playing games (RPGs) are all about playing a fictional character who
moves through a fictional world. When you play a character in an RPG,
you take on the role of that character, just like an actor in a play. But unlike
the actor, you have no script to follow; you and your fellow players have free
will that lets you influence the events of the story as they unfold.
But what do you do within the game world? Well, you can have a lot of fun
enjoying the company of your friends and having the chance to step into 
the shoes of someone else whose life is dramatically different from your 
own. And you can also create entire campaigns and worlds for others to
enjoy, but we get back to that in the last parts of the book.
Your character may explore a dungeon, puzzle out a mystery, or thwart the
plans of an evil Mastermind. It all depends on the intents of the person who
created the world and how you (in the role of your character) respond to 
the various events.

Who Is Involved
At a minimum, a gaming group consists of at least two people — the person
managing (and in some cases, creating) the framework of the adventure and
the person experiencing the adventure. But most gaming groups consist of
four to eight people. Our regular group has fluctuated over the years, but
there are usually about eight of us. Certainly, larger groups are possible, 
but coordinating that many people can be quite a challenge.
The Game Master (GM)
To have an adventure, you need a setting for the adventure. You also need
someone to craft the story line — creating puzzles, hiding treasures, and 
providing challenges. And you need someone to manage the action, resolve
any conflicts, and decide what is required to overcome each challenge. The
person who provides the setting and fulfills all these roles is called the Game
Master, or GM.
The GM provides the plot outline, the framework for all the action that will
occur. This may be as simple as creating a map of a building to be explored,
or as complex as creating an entire world with various cultures. In many
ways, the fictional world belongs to the GM, who invites the players to 
come into that world and explore.
The player characters (PCs)
Most people begin their experiences with GURPS by creating and playing a
character in an adventure. It is the action of these player characters (PCs)
that determines the course of events that unfold within the GM’s framework.
With the exception of the GM, everyone in a group creates one or more char-
acters for the adventure. These characters band together to form a group
known as “the party.”
New players often prefer that the GM provide very clear and precise guide-
lines about how their characters should be created. In fact, they sometimes
want the GM to provide them with a completed, playable character, or they
prefer to customize one of the character templates provided in the various
GURPS books or by the GM. Other people truly enjoy the character-creation
process as much as the actual adventure and may constantly be designing
new characters for possible adventures or just for their own amusement.
10
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Players create their characters by building a list of the psychological, social,
and physical characteristics that define the individual. In GURPS, these are
expressed as attributes (such as IQ), advantages, and disadvantages. Then
the player gives each character a set of skills that defines what the character
is good at. The remaining chapters in Part I guide you through the process of
character creation.
Within gaming circles, people commonly refer to their characters in the first
person — “I managed to crawl across the pit of snakes and grab the magical
staff.” For many, the enjoyment of the game is more in role playing the char-
acter than in the action of the adventure. For reasons mysterious to us, we
and other gamers frequently talk about running our characters rather than
playing them. RPGs are filled with jargon of this sort, but we try to avoid it
whenever possible in this book.
Nonplayer characters (NPCs)
Many GMs provide other characters for the player characters to interact with.
Referred to as nonplayer characters (NPCs), these characters do not have free
will but instead are all managed by the GM and exist to help enrich and guide
the story line. NPCs can help the party, provide information, provide texture,
or be the very opponents that the characters must defeat. Creating and man-
aging the NPCs is the responsibility of the GM.
When and Where: The Game 
World Defines the Game
In the real world, you need to schedule a time for your gaming group to get
together and find a place to meet. But the when and where of the fictional
world form the setting of the adventure created by the GM and inhabited by
the players’ characters. With GURPS, you can create any of the following
types of worlds (as well as many more):
 Futuristic or imaginary worlds
 Historical settings or alternate histories
 Sword and sorcery
 High fantasy
 Contemporary worlds
11
Chapter 1: Introducing GURPS — The Generic Universal RolePlaying System

The same basic set of rules is used for each of these adventures; what differs
is the setting in terms of social environment, laws of the physical universe,
technological advancement, or any combination of these elements.
Understanding the setting of the adventure is necessary for you to under-
stand how to create your character and how your character would respond
to the various situations. For instance, the responses of someone raised in a
version of Victorian England in which magic is a daily occurrence would
differ dramatically from those of someone of contemporary, realistic London.
What You Need
All you really need to play GURPS are some completed character sheets,
three six-sided dice, and a GM with an adventure. Some paper and a pencil to
take notes, a few comfy chairs, and a table to hold maps are all nice addi-
tions, too. Oh, and don’t forget the food and drink. Gaming sessions fre-
quently last for many hours, often late into the night.
In most cases, however, the gaming starts with character creation, so you’ll
need access to some basic references for understanding the options available
to you. The best resource is a combination of this book and GURPS Basic 
Set: Characters, which is available at most gaming stores. GURPS Basic Set:
Characters provides detailed descriptions of all of the advantages, disadvan-
tages, and skills that your character might have as well as the basic rules 
that the player needs to know. The book you hold in your hands supplements
GURPS Basic Set: Characters and provides guidance in selecting from the 
various options and for getting the most out of your gaming experience.
When you are first starting out, you may want to begin by downloading
GURPS Lite, a free guide available from Steve Jackson’s online store, e23, at
http://e23.sjgames.com, rather than purchasing the complete Basic Set.
GURPS Lite provides abbreviated lists of advantages, disadvantages, and
skills with brief descriptions of each along with a good overview of the most
important rules.
12
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Which: The new fourth edition
GURPS For Dummies is written for the fourth-
edition rules of GURPS as presented in GURPS
Basic Set and the various other fourth-edition
titles. The information provided is useful for
players and GMs using the third edition, but we
recommend you consider upgrading to the 
new version. The rules have been streamlined,
particularly around character creation and
combat, and the entire system has been
retooled to fit together a bit more seamlessly. To
make the transition, we strongly recommend
you download GURPS Update, available at
http://e23.sjgames.com.

Most gaming groups also use mapping grids (with a hexagonal pattern) and
character figures to track the position of everyone during the action (particu-
larly during combat). More and more, we find ourselves using our computers
to manage our character sheets, to keep track of important facts, and basi-
cally to replace pencil and paper.
How the Game Is Played
GURPS can be played almost as a board game. You have a map that diagrams
the areas that you are exploring, and you make dice rolls to determine the
outcome of each of your actions. But for us, GURPS is more about shared sto-
rytelling, an experience in which we each play a role in creating a fictional
story line.
The game starts with the GM describing the game world so that you can begin
your character creation. That description includes not only a general idea of
the type of society and the physical characteristics of the world but also
includes rules about how your character can be created. The most notable of
these is the point value of the campaign — the total number of points that you
can spend to create your character. The limitation of the point value is what
makes character creation interesting. You can’t have every advantage and
every skill available; instead, you have to fit together those that let you create
the character you want. The GM may also provide other guidelines. For exam-
ple, some advantages or disadvantages may not be available or may be
required for your particular campaign.
After everyone has their characters defined, the GM begins by describing the
initial scene. Many times, this involves a situation that allows the various
characters to meet for the first time. Some sort of problem is presented to
the characters. It may be an attack, a job offer, or tantalizing clues of a mys-
tery. Whatever the mechanism, the GM begins to lead the characters into 
the story line.
Of course, how the characters respond is up to the players. And that’s where
things start to get interesting. The GM can only provide a framework and
attempt to lure the characters into it. The players determine which clues
they’ll follow or what approach they’ll take to any given problem. For exam-
ple, the GM may decide to attack the party, but the players decide whether 
to run away, defend themselves, or take yet another route.
Interactions with other PCs are done by talking among the players. In general,
most conversation is done in the first person, so rather than saying, “My
mage asks your soldier to hand him the map,” you’re likely to say, in the role
of your mage, “Hey, soldier boy, hand me the map.”
13
Chapter 1: Introducing GURPS — The Generic Universal RolePlaying System

Interactions with NPCs are done by talking with the GM. The GM may respond
by providing you a description of what happens or just the facts and informa-
tion, or the interaction may also be in the first person. This depends in part on
the GM’s style and in part on how important the NPC is to the plotline.
The success of actions in which the outcome involves a large degree of chance,
such as whether a character is able to dodge an attack or open a lock, is
determined by dice roll. Each character has a different set of skills, and so in
each situation, different players may be required to respond. Your character
sheet records your base skills in those things you know; the GM may adjust
that skill based on circumstances (for instance, picking a lock in a noisy,
darkened bar). A successful roll is one in which the total of the three dice is
less than or equal to the character’s adjusted skill. That means that you suc-
cessfully performed the task. A failed roll means that you failed at the task.
Unlike many other role playing games, a successful GURPS dice roll is lower
than a target number. Many other games require high rolls. Other games also
frequently require specialized dice, but GURPS is played with ordinary six-
sided dice — the ones used for many board games.
As your characters experience the adventure, you as the player gain knowl-
edge and insight about the fictional world. You then direct your character
toward the goals that the GM has set before you. As the adventure pro-
gresses, you’ll likely find yourself deepening your understanding of your
character and getting a clearer picture of the GM’s world, much as an actor
begins to live his role as he rehearses it over time. This opportunity to grow
as a character (and as a player) is what sets GURPS apart from other role
playing games and is what makes GURPS such fun to play.

Chapter 2
Determining Your Role
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the type of character you want to be
 Defining your character’s personality
 Using a character template
 Being practical in your character choices
H
ave you ever dreamed about being a wealthy socialite with crime-fight-
ing powers, a powerful mage, a brilliant scientist, or a secret agent with
a shady past? With GURPS, any of these roles can be yours; you just have to
decide which you want to be. And what’s great is that you don’t need years of
training, working out at the gym, or exposure to radiation. All you need is to
come up with an outline of who you want to be.
GURPS is about role playing. Just like an actor on stage, a good role player
sets aside parts of his own personality and takes on those of the character. 
A good character has a life of his own. In fact, it’s not uncommon for players
to talk about their characters as though they have their own emotions and
agendas. This chapter focuses on how to go about deciding what type of
character to play, which sets the direction for all of the other choices you
need to make during character creation. The rest of the chapters in this part
walk you through the process of creating your character.
Identifying the Character Framework
More than just describing what you can and can’t do, your character defines
what you will and won’t do while playing him. If you decide that your charac-
ter is curious and impulsive, then you, as your character, need to go ahead
and push the strange button — even when, as a player, you suspect the GM
has a bomb attached to it. And if you decide that your character is all
strength and no brains, then you have to bite your tongue even when you
know the answer to a puzzle.

16
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
The framework for character construction
In human development, the mechanics of how you became the person you
are today is a combination of your genetics and the experiences to which you
were exposed. In GURPS character development, the process is a bit simpler.
You have a set of points (determined by your Game Master, or GM) that you
can spend to buy attributes (Chapter 3), advantages and perks (Chapter 4),
and skills (Chapter 6), and you can get more points by taking disadvantages
and quirks for your character (Chapter 5). The entire universe is available to
you (well, except as limited by the number of points you have and any
restrictions imposed by the GM), so you must have a focus — a framework
around which you intend to build your character.
Defining the game world
The first step in crafting your character is making sure you understand the
limits of the campaign you will be playing in. And the very first thing you
need to know is what types of abilities are permitted there. Can your charac-
ter be from a more advanced technological society or perhaps from the
future? What about being a magic user? Are the types of available advantages
limited? The GM must answer all of these questions for you. From there, you
can then decide which, if any, of those special abilities or roles appeal to you.
Considering the available points
The next thing to consider is how many points the GM has made available 
to you. Although the same general framework can be used to create both a
250-point character and a 100-point character, the two need to be approached
very differently. A 100-point character should be conceived as an action 
hero — just a little bit larger than life. A character built on 250 points likely
has abilities that most people can’t hope to obtain.
One thing to know right now — no matter how many points you get, you
never have enough. And it’s not the number of points that makes a character
interesting and fun but how you spend them; one of our campaigns started
with 50-point characters, and we had a great time taking on the local street
gangs as our enemies until we worked our way up to bigger and badder foes.
Determining the party purpose
Each type of adventure can require a different set of characters. Exploring an
abandoned dungeon is likely to require mostly combat and thief skills, whereas
solving a mystery in Victorian England requires social skills as well as problem
solving. The GM should give you enough information about what to expect so
that you know the type of characters needed but never so much direction
that you feel that your creativity is being limited. A key aspect of this infor-
mation is the campaign setting — the party that’s appropriate for medieval
fantasy probably won’t do so well in a space adventure (though don’t be sur-
prised if a good GM switches the environment on you during the campaign).

A good starting point for the process of selecting party members is determin-
ing what, if any, specialists are required. For instance, in many futuristic 
campaigns, you may need a character devoted to computer operations or
piloting. In some cultural settings, you might need someone of a higher social
class to “front” for the party in order to gain entrance to reputable society.
And in a campaign in which religions play an important role, having a priest
or two may be critical. It’s also a good idea to pay attention to healing and to
consider whether you need any characters devoted to support roles, focus-
ing on things such as languages, the Merchant skill, and knowledge about the
regions where you expect the action to occur (Area Knowledge).
From that point, you can then decide how many in the party need to be
combat-focused and how many need to be focused on exploration or puzzle
solving. When it comes to choosing combat-focused team members, try to
balance your party as much as possible. Keep in mind which of your team
members specialize in offensive versus defensive modes of combat and
which types of attack they employ.
The framework for role playing
The other component to consider as you begin outlining your character is
how you like to run (role play) your characters and how much of your own
personality needs to fit into the characters. One of our rules is that every
character played by Stuart has to have the Fast-Talk skill — the ability to
come up with convincing stories on the spur of the moment. That’s just too
much a part of Stuart’s personality for him to set aside.
In most campaigns, it’s usually more fun to take skills and advantages that
you actually understand. For example, if you’re playing in a futuristic cam-
paign, leave the computer hacking to someone who knows how computers
work. Of course, this is not an absolute rule. After all, what you can achieve 
is actually determined by dice rolls — you don’t actually have to know how
to go out and hack into the Pentagon computer network just because your
character is going to. But knowing something about the skill helps you know
what’s possible and hence what to even attempt.
You also need to know a little bit about your own personality. Part of the fun
is challenging yourself with the role that you take on. Many gamers try play-
ing characters of the opposite gender or with personalities dramatically dif-
ferent from their own. But as you play, you’ll find that certain traits don’t
work well for you. Stuart absolutely cannot play Easy to Read (a disadvan-
tage where what you are thinking is easy to deduce just by looking at your
face) to save his life — that Fast-Talk part of his brain is too deeply ingrained.

Chapter 2: Determining Your Role

Determining Competencies 
and Personality
When you know something about the general environment for your campaign
and the number of points available, and you’ve thought a bit about how your
personality influences what sort of character you’ll play, it’s time to think about
who your character is going to be and how he or she fits in with the other
characters in the party. In some campaigns, the GM may guide you to some
good choices — “the party needs a healer, at least two combat monsters, and
a computer hacker” or “worry about brains, not brawn, for this adventure.”
Checking in with the other players about what they are considering can also
be very helpful, particularly to avoid too much overlap in the party.
Creating a useful character
A number of standard party roles are worth considering for your own charac-
ter. Do you want to be the smart one? The strong one? The con artist? Think
about the cast of any good book or television adventure show and you’ll
begin to see how each of these roles can be represented. In fact, one way to
develop a character is to identify a fictional character and use him or her as a
guideline for the types of skills and personality to give your own character.
In deciding your functional role, think about what sorts of things you want
your character to be able to do. Some things to consider:
 How do you feel about combat? Is your character the one with the most
powerful weapon or the one who prefers sneak attacks? Or does he hide
in the corner and hope that the rest of the party can handle the problem?
 What about social interactions? Do you want your character to be the
one who talks her way out of tough situations? Or do you want your
character to be the one who gets the party into tough situations with his
loud mouth?
 How sneaky do you want your character to be? Does your character
know how to find secret passages and disarm traps? Can your character
follow someone through the forest or down a busy street?
 Do you want to be the brains? Does your character have the skills to
research arcane knowledge or solve puzzles? Does he collect informa-
tion the way others collect gold and jewels? Can she outwit the oppo-
nents without breaking a sweat?
 If the campaign permits them, does your character have any special
abilities, such as magic, psionics, or super-powers?
18
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

 Do you want your character to have specialized technical knowledge?
Is he more a scientist or an artist?
 What about support skills? When someone yells “Medic!” is your char-
acter the one to respond? Does your character know how to negotiate,
speak 17 different languages, or pilot every vessel the party is likely to
encounter?
The answers to these questions help you get a sense of the type of character
you’re going to create. Deciding on role is independent of any special abilities
allowed by the GM. A combat-focused character can be normal, magical, or
superheroic and can be placed in a medieval, contemporary, or futuristic 
setting.
Generalist versus specialist
A generalist is a character who can do a variety of things around a particular
focus, whereas a specialist has one skill or advantage that most of the rest of
his abilities support.
Thieves can be generalists by having a collection of skills like figuring out
which houses or businesses to target, disposing of acquired items, defending
themselves in a fight, and a wide range of general thief and spy skills, such as
Stealth, Shadowing, and Scrounging. Looking at the functional role, this char-
acter certainly serves as the sneaky role but can also function in social situa-
tions, solve puzzles, and perhaps even have specialized technical knowledge.
On the other hand, you can design a thief to be a very specific second-story
artist. All of the skills and advantages revolve around being able to get in and
get back out of the upper floors of a building undetected. Details like figuring
out which houses have valuables, fencing the loot, and dealing with other
underworld contacts are left to other party members or a trusted contact.
An even more generalist approach is the character who brings together sev-
eral different roles. A character who is an upper-class bard by day and a dark
assassin by night with hidden magical talents pushes the envelope of the idea
of a generalist (but, boy, is she a fun character to play!).
Party balance
The need for party balance stems from the limited number of points available
for creating each character. No single character can have all the abilities that
the party needs. Combat, for example, is subdivided into close combat, melee
combat, and long-range combat (see Chapter 11). Each of these requires a dif-
ferent set of attributes, advantages, skills, and equipment — all of which cost
points. So no single character is able to be expert at all of these types of
combat.
19
Chapter 2: Determining Your Role

In a larger party, each character has more room to be a specialist. Certain
roles (such as combat and healer) almost always need to be covered by
someone (or several someones). You must think about how your character
fits into the larger party when you first begin creating the framework. If the
GM permits it, talking with other players can help you understand what the
party needs in terms of roles. Or think about what type of generalist charac-
ter would do well and build from there.
Creating a character that’s fun to play
Having a useful character is important, but enjoying what you’re doing is the
whole point of gaming. We believe that two things contribute to an enjoyable
character:
 A level of competency that allows you to contribute to the party.
 A personality that draws you in to seeing yourself as the character.
For some people, a fun character is easy to play, straightforward in actions and
thoughts, and focused on a relatively narrow goal. For others, fun means com-
plexity. The personality of the character has depth and can force the player to
act in ways contrary to her own nature. The character may have multiple agen-
das or a wide range of abilities that require extensive bookkeeping to manage.
One thing to consider is how much you want to stretch your role-playing abil-
ities. Do you want to play a character who’s totally different from the person-
ality you normally have? If you’re outgoing, try playing a shy introvert. Or if
you tend to be cautious, let your character be a risk-taker. On the other hand,
you may be more comfortable playing a character who is similar to you but
who has enhanced abilities. Either works well in an adventure, and it’s up to
you to decide which is the most fun.
Think about creating a character with some inherent contradictions — the
thief who is absolutely honest, the spy who is clumsy, or the warrior who
can’t stand the sight of blood. These sorts of contradictions make for inter-
esting role playing opportunities and can be a lot of laughs.
Another good option is to take a character from fiction that you enjoy, such
as Indiana Jones, Superman, or Sherlock Holmes. You can even adjust their
personalities to better suit your own ends. One interesting variant is to make
them a bit more archetypical — exaggerate the characteristics that define
them as a character type, such as Holmes’s perceptual and deductive abili-
ties (and perhaps even his addictions).
One thing to keep in mind is making sure that your character will have things
to do during the adventure. You want to consider both what he’ll be doing
during combat as well as at other times. Having a skill or group of skills that
is unique within the party ensures that you’ll have something to contribute.
20
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Outlining Your Character
After finding out what’s permitted in the campaign and giving some thought
to what sort of role you’d like to play, you can begin outlining your character.
Start by writing down the available points, the abilities that are allowed that
interest you (if any), and, keeping the party purpose in mind, a prioritized list
of the functional areas that you are interested in. This should result in a very
brief descriptive overview of a character, such as any of the following:
 The Investigator: A 100-point individual in a contemporary setting in
which the occult plays a big role. Primarily an investigator but with a
research bent. Able to fight reasonably well. Good problem-solving with
practical day-to-day survival skills but not a survivalist or scientist.
 The Mage: A 200-point mage in a medieval fantasy setting with a combat
focus along with the social skills to get into “proper” culture. Not sneaky
or problem-solving-oriented.
 The Superhero: A 500-point character with abilities far beyond what
“normal” humans can do but which do not come from magic. Some sort
of focus on the power around a particular theme.
This initial character concept anchors the rest of your decisions. Although
you shouldn’t let yourself feel locked into what you first put down, this initial
concept allows you to narrow the wide range of advantages and disadvan-
tages available down to those that are most appropriate for your character.
And it also guides you as you begin to list the skills that you want.
21
Chapter 2: Determining Your Role
Keeping secrets from other players
As you get to know other people in real life, you
slowly find out things about them. Very few of
us have a complete description of our person-
ality pinned to our T-shirts. The same can be
true of your character. Slowly revealing aspects
of your personality through role playing leads to
a far more interesting campaign than just letting
other players read your character sheet.
Secrets can include advantages, perks, quirks,
or skills, and should almost always include dis-
advantages that wouldn’t be apparent the first
time someone meets you (but more on those in
the following chapters).
On the other hand, you need to tell the GM
everything. The more the GM understands how
you view your character, the better he can
adapt the adventure to your interests and goals
(or, more precisely, your character’s interests
and goals). Your character sheet (discussed in
Chapter 13) should contain notes about all
aspects of your character. It may be necessary
to elaborate on the details; for instance, if your
character is an expert in art history, it helps if
the GM has an idea of how to find out more
about the topic.

Deciding on a focus
Most characters have a focus — an attitude, a particular advantage, a set of
skills, or a power that defines the core aspects of that character. The focus is
part of the character concept, but whereas the initial concept describes the
goal, the focus describes how you get to that goal.
An investigator can be focused on scholarly research, can have a naturally
inquisitive nature, or can have empathy that helps her see into the motiva-
tions of those she meets. A combat-focused character might be extraordinar-
ily strong, be particularly talented with a single weapon, or be a martial
artist. A mage, for example, might specialize in elemental spells or be focused
on spells that involve objects or are related to a particular religion.
22
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Using a character template
Character templates provide another way of
finding a starting point for developing your char-
acter. A character template brings together a
set of attributes, advantages, and skills to define
a role and then adds disadvantages to produce
a more complete starting point. Some charac-
ter templates are specific to a setting (such as
a mage), but many can be easily adapted to
apply to a variety of worlds (such as an investi-
gator). Some GMs may also provide templates
specific to the campaign as possible starting
points. The advantages and disadvantages in a
character template generally count toward any
campaign limitations (most notably the typical
limitations on total points gained from disad-
vantages, discussed in Chapter 5).
Don’t be afraid to customize a template (but
check with the GM before you do, especially if it
is a template that the GM provided). The purpose
of a template is to give you a starting point, not to
limit your creativity. Don’t worry too much about
the point value of the template. You may find that
you need to adjust the template to be more
appropriate for the particular campaign. Usually,
templates are relatively low-cost (in points) and
allow you to add advantages or perks as well as
additional skills. However, in some cases, you
may need to reduce a template’s point value; the
best place to look for saving points is by either
adding disadvantages or eliminating advantages.
You can even mix templates if the two roles are
complementary (a warrior-priest for instance, or
even a priestly thief), although this is best left to
more-experienced players. Keep in mind that the
more roles you combine into a single character,
the more complex that character will be to play.
Racial templates are a very special kind of start-
ing point. They provide a framework for a char-
acter that is not a normal human. Most notably,
this means that the character may start with
significantly different attributes or with traits
that are unavailable to mere humans. Racial
templates are often more expensive, but typi-
cally, the disadvantages listed do not count
toward any campaign limits. You can find more
information about playing nonhumans or non-
standard humans in Chapter 10.

A focus can also be something that makes the character particularly news-
worthy or fun to play. A generalist character who knows only things that he
saw on television has a focus that’s a little out of the ordinary but definitely
helps define how the character will come together.
Another thing to consider in deciding on a focus is how you will develop that
character over time. As you campaign, your character will have opportunities
to learn new skills or develop the skills he already possesses. A good focus is
one in which you start out above-average and have a goal of being extraordi-
nary. A good real-world example is someone studying martial arts whose
long-term goal is to become a master of the art.
If you don’t have a focus when you first start drafting your character, don’t
worry. It’s fine to begin filling in attributes, advantages, and disadvantages
first to get a better sense of the type of character you are creating. And some
characters may have more than one focus — in that case, make sure that you
are comfortable with such a complex character. And, to be honest, some-
times it is hard to decide on a character’s focus until after you start playing.
Fitting your character into the party
One of the things that you should do very early on with any character is
make sure that he can survive and contribute within the campaign. Think
about the various situations that you may encounter and what your charac-
ter will do in each. Although being the world’s best pickpocket might be fun,
if the campaign primarily happens in a dungeon, it’s unlikely you’ll be very
involved unless you have other skills to bring into play.
What are you going to do in a fight?
Not everyone in the party needs to be a front-line combatant ready to take 
on numerous opponents. But in almost every type of campaign, there will 
be some battles. And you need to think about what you’re going to be doing
during those conflicts. If your character has to run and hide when a fight
breaks out, then you as a player are going to be bored. And being bored is
rarely good. At the initial character creation, you just want to have some 
idea of what your character is likely to do during combat; you’ll fill in the
details with skills and equipment later.
At the very least, your character should have some basic close-combat 
skills. The gaming world is a dangerous place, and you need to be able to
defend yourself. You also should have something that you can do during 
a melee combat. GURPS provides options for all types of characters and
23
Chapter 2: Determining Your Role

doesn’t require that you have a high strength to be effective. There are vari-
ous thrown weapons or sneak attacks, such as poison, that depend more on
dexterity than strength to do damage. Chapter 11 provides details about how
combat works and suggestions about selecting weapons and combat skills.
If you don’t want to be a frontline warrior, consider skills or abilities that let
you provide a distraction, offer a way of protecting other party members, or
provide healing. Another option is to consider taking some sort of unusual
weapon, such as a knife or staff, that keeps you involved even if it doesn’t do
a great deal of damage.
Campaign skills
Be sure to identify what types of things you believe your character will con-
tribute to the party goal. Consider making a list of the skills that you think
will be unique to your character and sound out the other players to find out
whether there is overlap with what you are intending. Also think about the
overall setting and try to identify types of skills that you will need in order 
to fit into society, or just ask the GM. Knowing that most of your time will be
spent out in the forest calls for a different approach to character design than
you’d take for a campaign set in the city.
Depending on other party members
Just as important as knowing what your character is all about is knowing
what you’re counting on others to provide. You shouldn’t try to design a
character that can do everything by herself. Having weak areas frees up
points to spend in improving other areas. And needing to depend on each
other is part of what brings a party together and makes for an enjoyable
experience for all of the players.
Filling in character details
At some point in creating your character, you need to decide what your 
character looks like and all the other details that define him. As you create
your character concept, you may develop a sense of some of these aspects,
whereas other aspects may remain vague until you have filled in more of 
the character details. For now, it’s enough to get a general sense and wait 
to fill in the specifics.
Physical appearance
The first physical question to answer is gender. Is the character male or
female? Many players base this decision on their own gender, either always
playing the same gender as their own or always playing the opposite. Others
make the decision based on the role.
24
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Another approach is to think of larger-than-life examples and decide which is
more interesting to you. For instance, there’s quite a bit of difference between
Xena the Warrior Princess and Conan the Barbarian, even though both of
them are primarily combat-focused.
Attributes (discussed in Chapter 3) may also contribute to how you envision
your character. Or conversely, how you envision your character may deter-
mine what sort of attributes you consider. If you see the character as small
and slight, then you probably aren’t going to make her extraordinarily strong.
You want to be able to specify the character’s height and weight as well as
provide a general description of his build.
25
Chapter 2: Determining Your Role
Sample characters: Concepts
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
The new campaign allows only 100-point char-
acters, so I won’t be able to afford any outstand-
ing characteristics. The world includes the
supernatural (vampires and werewolves have
been specifically mentioned as real for this set-
ting). The setting is modern, so I can go up to TL8
in equipment. Given all of that, a human occult
investigator who is smart, knowledgeable, and
fast sounds good. Knowing the GM, I’m counting
on more confrontations than investigation, so
combat will probably be central. I like the tough
female private eye in literature, so I think I’ll make
this character female. She’ll have many sources
of information as well as a lot of skills in various
areas (though nothing too “bookish”).
Bjoern’s Mage Character
Our gaming group is getting ready to start a new
campaign, and we just received our “briefing”
from the GM. This campaign is going to be a
standard swords-and-sorcery campaign with all
spells from GURPS Magic available, a maximum
Magical Aptitude level of 3, the standard nonhu-
man races (elves, dwarves, halflings, and orcs),
TL3, and $1,000 starting wealth. This is going to
be a strongly combat-oriented campaign, and
the GM has advised us that it would be diplo-
matically advantageous to have some nonhu-
mans in the party. We need to create 200-point
characters with up to –100 points in disadvan-
tages and –5 points in quirks. After consulting
with the other players, I’ve decided to play a non-
human mage.
Adam’s Supers Character
The GM decides to start a new campaign, based
loosely on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Beneath
the apparently placid surface of society, evil
lurks just out of sight, waiting to devour an unsus-
pecting populace. The campaign calls for TL6
characters built on 350 points, with a –40 point
limit on disadvantages. Powers are allowed, but
they must be derived from the supernatural or
from gadgeteering devices (rather than, say,
from accidents involving radiation or mutations).
The GM advises that the party should have sev-
eral useful fighters and someone with healing
power (this last accompanied by unsettling
laughter) and should also contain characters
with good investigative skills. I decide I’d like to
run one of the more combat-oriented characters,
although I’m inclined to throw in a few abilities
that are useful out of combat.

Names and titles
Coming up with a good name for your character can be quite a challenge. A
good resource is one of the many baby-naming sites on the Internet. At these
sites, you can limit suggested names to a specific culture and often find out
the meaning of the names to help you decide. You can also make up names
that just sound good — a particularly common practice for fantasy charac-
ters. You may also want to consider giving your character a nickname
(although, frequently, the other players will take care of that for you).
Titles can be a bit trickier. If you want to give your character a title that con-
veys status, such as Doctor or Count, you need to check with the GM about
what is required. Is it a real title? If so, your Doctor may have to have a spe-
cific skill level in her specialty, and your Count may need advantages that
represent his wealth and social standing. If it’s not real, you may need to take
skills such as Fast-Talk to justify how you’ve convinced others that you really
are the long lost ruler of a small island nation.

Chapter 3
Laying the Attribute Foundation
In This Chapter
 Determining the attributes your character needs
 Calculating the levels of your basic attributes (IQ, DX, ST, and HT)
 Figuring out secondary characteristics
 Establishing your character’s social role
A
ttributes define the basic capabilities of your character and are the basis
for any skills that you acquire. One of the first things you need to do when
creating a character is adjust the character’s attributes to reflect the areas in
which you want your character to excel. It may also be useful to reduce the
attributes in areas that don’t matter to the character’s success. Deciding on
your character’s attributes is a good starting point in the character-creation
process, but you will probably need to come back and adjust your attribute
expenditures after you’ve purchased advantages and skills. For more informa-
tion about this process, see Chapter 6.
Using the information presented in this chapter as a guide, adjust your start-
ing attributes. In general, consider dividing the total points available equally
among attributes, advantages, and skills; the total points available is the
point total allowed by the GM plus the disadvantages that you take. This
means roughly half the points permitted should go toward attributes. We con-
sider that, however, a general guideline. We frequently reduce that for a mage
and increase it for a character who relies on physical abilities for combat.
Include in the cost of your attributes any points spent to modify your Basic
Speed or Basic Move.
Selecting the Right Attributes 
for Your Role
The four basic attributes in GURPS are Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX),
Intelligence (IQ), and Health (HT). Most skills are based either on IQ or 
on DX, which is reflected in the fact that these attributes are worth 20 
points per level. ST and HT are worth 10 points per level.

Normal humans start with all of their attributes set to a value of 10, described
as average. If you want your character to be particularly strong in any area,
you want to raise the attribute values to a minimum of 13, described as
exceptional. If a character is to have a focus that is based on an attribute 
(as opposed to one based on a collection of advantages or a specific set of
skills), then you may want to raise the attribute to 15 or more, described as
amazing.
We do not recommend reducing any attribute to less than 8, which is described
as below average, unless you do not intend to use that attribute at all during
play. Even if you don’t plan to use the attribute, keep in mind that if you ever
need to roll against an attribute of 8, your chance of success is only 26 percent.
Being the party smarty-pants — IQ
IQ is particularly important to any character focused on intellectual skills or
knowledge. If you want to run a character who is able to analyze information,
recite critical facts, and overcome mental challenges, you need to invest in IQ.
Some examples of characters that require an investment in IQ are as follows:
 A character intended for espionage. A high IQ provides a good founda-
tion in necessary skills, such as Shadowing and Disguise.
 A character in a futuristic campaign in which physical tasks and interac-
tions are less important.
 A character focused primarily on social interaction (because most social
skills are based on IQ).
 Any magic user. All spells are based on IQ.
The Perception secondary characteristic
IQ comes into play any time you are trying to notice something. Observing
things is actually controlled with the secondary attribute Perception (Per),
which starts out equal to IQ and can be adjusted from IQ at a cost of 5 points
per level. Any roll to notice something is made directly against your Per value
unless a specific skill can be brought into play. In general, those skills are in
turn based specifically on Per and include
 Body Language
 Detect Lies
 Lip Reading
 Search
 Tracking
28
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Raising Per specifically, rather than raising IQ, results in a character who is
“street-smart” (in tune with her environment) rather than “book-smart.” Any
advantage or disadvantage that involves your senses interacts with
Perception.
The Will secondary characteristic
Will is another secondary characteristic that starts out equal to IQ; it can be
adjusted at a cost of 5 points per level. In any campaign that involves the
supernatural or magic, Will can play a very important role because it is used
to resist mind reading and any form of mind control (specifically with the
Mind Block skill). It is also the basis for the Exorcism skill.
Will is the base attribute for a number of skills that can be used to influence
other characters in the campaign, such as
 Captivate
 Intimidation
 Persuade
 Suggest
Will is also used for skills that represent a form of mental discipline, including
Autohypnosis, Dreaming, Meditation, and Power Blow.
Characters intended primarily for combat can afford to reduce their IQs.
However, playing a character with an IQ of 8 or less is a lot of work because
you have to restrain yourself, as a real live human, from solving problems
that your character would not have a hope of understanding.
Note that in futuristic campaigns, high-tech vehicle and equipment skills are
based on IQ rather than DX to reflect the importance of understanding and
manipulating the equipment rather than using your reflexes.
Being a twinkle toes — DX
DX is the core attribute for most physical skills (although a few are based on
HT instead). DX, along with HT, determines how quickly your character can
move and how well you can dodge. With most weapons, DX is the factor that
primarily determines how likely you are to hit a target. See Chapter 11 for
advice on selecting weapons and calculating the necessary statistics for your
character’s attacks and defenses.
Your Basic Speed is a calculated value that is used to determine how quickly
you react to a situation, your Basic Move, and your Dodge. Basic Speed is 
calculated by adding DX and HT and dividing by 4. From the results of the 
29
Chapter 3: Laying the Attribute Foundation

calculation, you derive your Basic Move — the number of yards your charac-
ter can move in one second — by dropping any fraction.
Here’s an example. If your DX is 12 and your HT is 10, your Basic Speed is (12
+ 10) ÷ 4, or 5.5. Dropping the fraction gives you your Basic Move value; in
this case, it’s 5.
In order to get the best Move, we recommend raising your Speed to a whole
number whenever possible (either by adjusting DX and HT or by buying the
necessary .25 increments at 5 points each). You can also buy increases in
Move at 5 points per yard per second, but we feel that this is not generally
the best investment of your points because covering long distances quickly
will only rarely be critical.
In a high-tech campaign, you can frequently use technology to overcome a
reduced DX. Magic users also have a variety of ways to increase a low DX,
including spells that can provide a temporary boost to their attributes. You
can also create a combat-oriented character that has a low DX — just invest
heavily in the weapon skill to make sure you can hit and increase your ST to
make sure you do enough damage when you do — and then let your enemies
come to you.
Note that many advantages and disadvantages can also modify how your DX
and skills interact, including those that improve or limit movement and those
that improve or limit your abilities to perform fine motor tasks. If your GM
permits it, you can raise the DX of a single arm or of both arms by using the
Arm DX advantage (12 or 16 per level). All DX-based skills using that arm ben-
efit from such an investment.
Being the fitness nut — HT
One of HT’s most important roles is its contribution to calculating your Basic
Speed and hence your Basic Move. It is also important for resisting poisons,
radiation, disease, and some types of spells. Such threats are most common
in high-tech or magical campaigns. HT also comes into play after you have
taken damage — it is the attribute that determines whether you remain con-
scious, and perhaps even alive, when severely injured.
But even with all of that, in many campaigns, HT is the attribute that you are
most likely to lower for your typical character. The thing to keep in mind,
however, is that HT represents your chance of remaining alive after taking
significant damage. Lower it too much and you won’t survive a typical battle.
30
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Characters who have abilities that require fatigue points (FP) to activate or
maintain, such as a mage, benefit from a higher HT because fatigue points are
based on HT. However, you can buy individual FP at 3 points each so if points
are particularly tight, you can lower HT and buy Fatigue back. Investing in FP
is wise for anyone with abilities that rely upon FP, but otherwise it isn’t too
vital. 
The skills that are based on HT include any activity in which athleticism or
endurance plays a key role, such as
 Carousing
 Hiking
 Sex Appeal
 Singing
 Swimming
Being the POWERHOUSE — ST
ST describes how much damage you can take, how hard you hit, and how
much you can carry. You can also use ST to get an idea of the general build of
your character by using the table on page 18 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters,
although the ranges provided are quite large.
Strength is very important because it equates to how much damage you can
take, represented as Hit Points (HP). HP can be adjusted with 2 points per
level, but you’ll rarely want to lower it. For any attack that uses the force of
your hand or arm, ST directly relates to the amount of damage that you can
inflict.
Encumbrance refers to how much weight you are carrying. The greater your
Encumbrance, the slower you move. Most characters function at Light
Encumbrance, which is twice your Basic Lift. Basic Lift equals the square 
of your ST divided by 5 (ST × ST ÷ 5).
The GM may permit you to buy Striking ST for 5 points per level to increase
your ST only for attacking, or Lifting ST for 3 points per level to increase 
your ST only for the purpose of figuring Basic Lift. For one-handed feats of
strength, it is more effective to purchase Arm ST at 3 points per level; this
affects both striking and lifting. To improve both arms, Arm ST costs 5 points
per level.

Chapter 3: Laying the Attribute Foundation

Understanding Social Standing
A GURPS adventure involves your character interacting with a variety of
other characters, many of whom are managed by the GM rather than by
another player. A number of your character’s characteristics determine how
these NPCs (nonplayer characters) respond to you, including the following:
 Appearance
 Status and Wealth
 Reputation
Appearance
The general appearance of your character is largely a matter of personal pref-
erence. You can use the ST table on page 18 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters to
get a suggestion about build, but things like eye color, hair color, age, and
basic physical features (including handedness) are left to your imagination.
However, how NPCs evaluate your attractiveness is a characteristic repre-
sented by an advantage or disadvantage. With no investment in appearance
level, other people will find your character average-looking. But you can
change your appearance level as described on page 21 of GURPS Basic Set:
Characters. To a great extent, how important appearance is depends on the
style of the GM, specifically, if and when he considers it in determining NPC
reactions.
Status and Wealth
The functional role your character plays in society is, for the most part, up to
you. The way in which society accepts or rejects your character in that role
is, however, determined by your Status. You can believe yourself to be the
prince of the local land, but unless you have invested in the Status necessary
for that role, society in general is not going to accept you. Variations on the
relationship between societal role and societal status are possible, as in the
unrecognized prince or the dethroned prince — the title may be real but it
conveys no status (and hence you do not have to purchase Status as an
advantage). In most campaigns, Status plays a very important role in how
NPCs respond, most particularly those who control access to important
parts of the societal structure.
32
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Although they are often intertwined in modern society, do not confuse Status
and Wealth within GURPS. Wealth is a very practical characteristic that trans-
lates directly to how much cash you start the campaign with and how much
money you earn on a monthly basis (assuming you are working or have an
independent income). Note, however, that maintaining Status frequently
requires Wealth (though it need not be personal wealth). Different technology
levels have different starting Wealth; for a general guide, see page 27 of
GURPS Basic Set: Characters, but check with your GM for specifics.
Both Status and Wealth can be varied so that they are above-average (an
advantage) or below-average (a disadvantage). Status varies with a fixed 5
points per level, and the various levels are described on page 265 of GURPS
Basic Set: Characters (along with a recommended cost of living for each).
Reputation
Appearance, Status, and a variety of other disadvantages and advantages
(both your character’s and those of the characters with whom he interacts)
contribute to the reaction of NPCs. All of those modifiers help determine the
general class of people to which your character belongs (wealthy nobility,
poverty-stricken thief, and so on). Modifiers related to the way your charac-
ter as an individual is known to the public are represented by Reputation.
Reputation consists of several factors, including how many people are likely
to know of your character by name, how likely they are to recognize her, and
how her reputation is likely to influence their responses.
Reputations can improve the likelihood that those who recognize your char-
acter will react favorably (an advantage), or a reputation can work against
your character (a disadvantage). Minor reputations (1/–1) are fun additions
to your character’s background and personality. More significant reputations
(10/–10 or more) must form a core part of your character’s identity in most
campaigns.
Reputations are a bit of a wildcard in terms of how useful they are during a
campaign. The GM may choose to incorporate them frequently, or they may
not be a significant factor. Having Patrons, Allies, or Contacts is a more
dependable way of ensuring help, and having an Enemy guarantees someone
out there is reacting negatively to you. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of
Patrons, Allies, and Contacts; see Chapter 5 to find out about Enemies.)

Chapter 3: Laying the Attribute Foundation

Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Sample characters: Attributes
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
For an occult investigator, the most important
attribute is, without a doubt, IQ. I envision the
character as tough but not necessarily a partic-
ularly wonderful fighter (so no need for high
DX). Her weapons are likely to be a gun and
judo, so I’m not worried about increasing ST,
either. I could raise her HT to account for her
toughness, but I think that’s more a personality
characteristic for her rather than a physical
trait, so I think I’ll go with normal values for HT
as well. That means I’m comfortable investing
enough points in IQ to raise it to 13. That gives
her a basic speed of 5, which is a little slow but
probably the best I can afford.
Bjoern’s Mage Character
My first step is actually determining my charac-
ter’s race, which I discuss in Chapter 10. I
decide on a halfling character, which has a
racial template cost of 20 points and has the
base attributes of ST –5, DX +1, HT +2, and Will
+2. I’ll use this as the foundation to create my
character’s attributes.
The most important attribute for a mage is IQ;
after that, it’s HT for the fatigue points. However,
a high Will also helps keep a mage from suc-
cumbing to mentally-focused magical attacks,
so a halfling has a leg up on other races in that
regard. An IQ of 14 is good for a mage charac-
ter; with Magery III, it gives a base skill level of
15 for hard spells and meets the prerequisites
of all but the Great Wish spell. I’m happy with an
HT of 12, but I’d like a little higher DX, so I go
with a 12. Having only 5 hit points (based on the
racial Strength of 5) is of concern, though, and
I’ll have to see what I can do to raise that
amount; the rulebook says (and the GM con-
firms) that a PC can have a number of hit points
only equal to 30 percent more than the ST score.
I’ll start with an ST of 8 with +2 HP to give this
character 10 hit points. At this time, this char-
acter has the following attributes: IQ 14, Will 16,
Per 14, DX 12, HT 12, Fat 12, ST 8, HP 10. This
gives him a Basic Speed of 6, which is pretty
darn good for a mage.
Adam’s Supers Character
What level of attributes you assign your char-
acter is often determined by the role you intend
her to play in the campaign. I intend my charac-
ter to be a fighter, and the most important attrib-
utes for fighters are ST, because ST determines
both hit points and how much damage you deal
out with hand-to-hand weapons, and DX, which
is what combat skills are based upon.
Because I intend to have my character fight
with supernatural powers, which generally do
damage that isn’t based on ST, DX is a more vital
statistic for me. For starters, I gave my charac-
ter a DX of 14, and I might raise it later if I have
points left over after buying powers.
350 points is a pretty high point total for a cam-
paign, and I should be able to afford pretty good
attributes all around. I expect this campaign to
put all of my attributes to the test, so for now I
assign levels of 12 to HT, IQ, and ST. I buy her
Basic Speed up to 7, which will be a great help
in fighting.

any heroes are defined by a single characteristic — X-ray vision, per-
fect balance, the ability to see onto the astral plane, and so on — that
sets them above others. Most of these abilities are defined within GURPS as
advantages.
An advantage is a trait that your character possesses that is part of her nature,
as opposed to a skill that she has learned. You have to remember to tell the GM
when you want to use an advantage, particularly if the advantage is likely to
modify the dice roll you are about to make or the actions of another character.
Just because you have the ability to tell when someone is lying doesn’t mean
you are necessarily paying attention and checking whether what someone says
is the truth.
Powers are groups of advantages that can include attacks, defenses, and
many other abilities, and represent special traits like psionics and super-
powers. Chapter 8 provides guidelines for creating and managing powers for
a campaign. 
The information presented here is useful for deciding which advantages to
consider. To help you compare advantages, the point value is included in
parentheses following the first mention in the paragraph where the advan-
tage is explained. Before adding an advantage to your character sheet, make
sure to read the complete description in GURPS Basic Set: Characters. To find
a specific advantage, use the Advantages section of the Traits List on page
297 of that book.

36
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Spending Points for Advantages
Advantages cost points and are generally bought at character creation.
Boosting a character’s abilities is generally done with a combination of
increased attributes (discussed in Chapter 3) and advantages. For many play-
ers, advantages represent the largest investment of points in the character.
Determining what you can afford
In deciding how many points you should invest in advantages, one of the first
things to consider is how much you want your character to have innate abili-
ties versus skills. Advantages can provide your character with information,
can enable him to do things that would otherwise be impossible, and can
make many activities easier, whereas skills determine how well he performs
specific tasks. In general, acquiring skills during a campaign is much easier
than acquiring advantages, if only because skills are generally less expensive.
In a campaign with a total character value of 150 points or less, we recom-
mend one of two core strategies:
 If you want one particularly costly advantage to define your character,
then that advantage should be your highest priority item. You then
select advantages that complement that core advantage.
 Focus on the 1- to 15-point advantages to create more of a generalist. List
out those advantages that you would like to have if budget were no con-
straint. After you’ve created that master list, identify what each advantage
will provide your character. Then prioritize the list relative to your charac-
ter concept — give those skills that help your character’s functional role a
higher priority than those that just seem generally useful. From there, just
select as many high-priority advantages as you can afford.
As a starting budget, consider spending as much as half of the available
points on advantages. If the campaign has a high character value (the
number of points available for character creation), you can combine the two
methods and will likely spend a higher percentage of the available points on
advantages, attributes, or both. As you invest points in other areas, you may
need to adjust the percentage given to advantages. 
Advanced players can reduce the cost of many advantages by placing limit-
ations on their use. A very common limitation is that of an activation roll,
which makes the advantage behave more like a skill in that you must roll
before using it. For more information about the types of limitations, see
Chapter 8.

Deferring a purchase
Even in heroic fiction, characters rarely develop new abilities without some
major event in their lives (such as exposure to radiation or falling into toxic
chemicals). Whether your character has the potential to gain advantages
during play is something to discuss with the GM. If you have specific advan-
tages in mind, be specific in talking about what would be required.
Gaining advantages during play can be an integral part of a campaign. Some
advantages, such as Combat Reflexes, are just naturally suited for living an
adventurer’s life. After all, if a bunch of strangers kept attacking you, you’d 
be more likely to pay closer attention to your environment and be a little
quicker on the draw yourself (that is, develop the advantages of Combat
Reflexes).
After discussing it with your GM, you may also decide to start with a single
advantage that you will develop into a set of related advantages. You might
not be able to afford being able to see in total darkness, but you might be
able to invest in improved Night Vision (1 point per level up to 9) in order to
provide a foundation for acquiring the full Dark Vision (25) advantage during
play. From improved Night Vision, you might also have the chance to acquire
other related abilities, such as Telescopic Vision or 360° Vision. Such plan-
ning provides a framework to explain the new powers and gives the GM a
heads-up for his own planning.
Perks and minor advantages
Perks are one-point advantages that add interest to your character and may
provide a very specialized ability. If you have a friend who can name the
details of every movie ever made, then you have a friend with a perk (knows
movie trivia). Perks are close cousins to quirks (discussed in the next chap-
ter). Whereas advantages and disadvantages must come from an approved
list, you are free to create your own perks and quirks.
Many advantages that cost 5 points are used as much to provide “flavor” to
your character as for their practical value. Use 5-point advantages and perks
to add richness to your character, but only after you’ve made sure you have
the necessary abilities to survive your adventure. In general, we suggest
noting these down in a separate area of your character sheet as you work on
creating your character. You can then come back to that list later to decide
which ones you want to keep.
37
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Improving Your Survival Chances
A number of advantages are particularly related to combat. If your charac-
ter’s primary function is being a front-line warrior, then investing in combat-
related advantages is a good idea. For most other types of characters, other
advantages are a better investment of points; the combat needs of such char-
acters can be best met with wise investments in skills and equipment.
Intended to help with role playing are those skills that supplement the player’s
own thinking and perception. One of the most notable of these is Common
Sense (10). If a player tends to be impulsive and to leap before looking, then
providing the character with Common Sense may be the answer. When a char-
acter has this advantage, a burden is placed on the GM to help guide the
player into making reasonable decisions. If you never seem to guess right,
consider Intuition (15), which helps your character make more accurate
guesses when faced with a series of choices.
Combat options
Improving your character’s defenses, making it easier to draw his weapon,
and making it more difficult to surprise or frighten him are all benefits of the
Combat Reflexes (15) advantage. Combat Reflexes is a wise investment for
any warrior, but particularly if that warrior will be leading your party into
battle (in which case, everyone in your party benefits by being able to react 
a bit faster). If your character is designed for combat and you have more
points to invest in advantages, we recommend you consider these other
choices:
 Danger Sense (15): The ability to anticipate an attack or other danger-
ous situation.
 Enhanced Defenses (Variable): Various improvements to one’s ability to
defend oneself from an attack.
 High Pain Threshold (10): Reduces one’s reaction to damage, which
thereby improves one’s ability to counterattack.
 Fearlessness (2 per level): Useful for reducing the effects of being
stunned or otherwise disabled in response to a frightening experience.
 Unfazeable (15): Eliminates the effects of a frightening experience.
One advantage to consider, depending upon your character’s fighting style, is
Ambidexterity (5). As we describe in Chapter 11, you normally have 
a –4 penalty to your skill if you try to use a weapon in your nondominant 
or off-hand. With the Ambidexterity advantage, this penalty is waived 
(which is particularly useful with the Extra Attack advantage, which lets 
you attack one more time each round).
38
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

An advantage related to having multiple attacks is Enhanced Tracking (5 per
level), which has nothing to do with following someone and everything to do
with shooting at more than one target within a round. Check with the GM,
however, because Enhanced Tracking is usually available only as a racial
trait; we include it here because we generally allow one or two levels for
normal humans.
Advanced combat — including martial arts — is also described in Chapter 11,
but you should be aware of some advantages that provide similar capacities,
including
 Extra Attack (25): The ability to take an additional attack without
penalty; frequently not allowed by the GM.
 Gunslinger (25): Eliminates the need to aim to get any accuracy bonus
from a weapon used with the Gun skill.
 Trained by a Master (or TBAM) (30): Improves both your attack and
defense with unarmed and melee weapons; also grants access to several
martial arts abilities. More on this in Chapter 11.
 Weapon Master (Variable): Gives you increased damage as well as bene-
fits similar to TBAM for known weapons.
These advantages are relatively expensive, though they’re worth the invest-
ment if your character focus is primarily combat-related. Check with your GM
about restrictions on these abilities because they are generally inappropriate
in a realistic campaign.
Defensive options
Most of your character’s defensive abilities come from your combat skills and
the type of equipment you purchase; however, a few advantages that you 
can take can help protect you. Of particular usefulness are those discussed
under the Enhanced Defense advantage, the uses of which are discussed in
Chapter 11.
Being harder to detect
Silence (5 per level) is useful in avoiding being heard, particularly when sneak-
ing up on or following someone. In general, your character does not get any
advantage from it in combat unless his foe is using a hearing skill to target him.
A related advantage is Chameleon (5 per level), which makes your character
harder to see and is discussed in Chapter 10. Both advantages are meant as
racial traits, but we generally allow one level of Silence for normal humans.
Similar effects can be created by taking levels of the Obscure (2 per level)
advantage, which makes it more difficult for others using the targeted sense
to detect you (each level of obscure subtracts one from their sense role).
39
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Obscure can be tailored to one or more senses and gives you the flexibility 
to mold how it works to your character conception. We believe, in direct 
contradiction of the standard GURPS guidelines, that reasonable levels 
of this advantage are appropriate for all types of characters, but we agree
that higher levels should be restricted to those outside of normal human.
Having a tougher skin
Normal humans can have certain forms of the Resistant (Variable) advan-
tage, which protects against such insidious dangers as disease and poison.
The cost depends on the threats against which you are protected and the
degree of protection. The Damage Resistance (5 per level) advantage is
needed to block actual physical damage, and is not available for normal
humans (see Chapter 11 for its description). Two other advantages that
improve your survival chances are Hard to Kill (2 per level) and Hard to
Subdue (2 per level).
Falling gently
A good advantage for thieves working those second-story jobs, Perfect
Balance (15) can help a character avoid falling. Even better, if your GM per-
mits it, Catfall (10) reduces the damage from falls, and we believe it should
be available for normal humans.
Healing
Perhaps the most useful advantage from a party perspective is Healing (30),
which can make you the most popular party member (at least immediately
after combat when everybody else is hurting). Including a party member 
with this advantage (or its magical equivalent) greatly increases the survival
chances of everyone in the party. Of course, this is a supernatural power, 
and the GM might not allow it in the campaign.
In completely mundane campaigns, the Rapid Healing (5) or Very Rapid
Healing (15) advantage should be considered. Note that characters with
either of these advantages still require much more time to recover from
damage than a character who has been healed by someone else.
Turning the odds
The Daredevil (15) advantage rewards you for taking risks. Although not
specifically a combat ability, it most often comes into play when you rush fool-
ishly into battle. We generally don’t recommend this advantage unless you as a
player are likely to take such risks with your character. A useful disadvantage
to combine Daredevil with is On the Edge, which encourages such behavior.
40
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

The more general Luck (Variable) advantage lets you have a bit more control
over the dice — well, at least occasionally, and only to the extent that you
can pick among three rolls of the dice. You can reduce the cost of the advan-
tage by limiting its usefulness, making it much more cost-effective for a wider
variety of characters.
Serendipity (15 per level) can be a great boon to a campaign and quite a bit
of fun for your character. Used primarily as a useful plot device for the GM,
this advantage ensures that your character will be involved in the most inter-
esting and unusual occurrences. Simply put, you’ll be at the right place at the
right time to serve the GM’s evil ends.
Getting More from Your Environment
Most adventures include some element of exploration as well as combat.
Even if the campaign is primarily oriented around a series of combat scenar-
ios, improving your ability to gain information from the environment is well
worth the investment. For the most part, advantages in these areas are less
central to character concept. The exceptions would be characters based on a
particular role, such as a mercenary who is highly aware of his environment
or a character with paranormal abilities that let her see things invisible to a
normal human.
Sight and sound
Because advantages don’t usually play a role in the way characters glean
information from their surroundings, you’ll probably have to rely on your
senses. All of your senses can be improved both in terms of sensitivity and
range. Sense rolls are generally based on the Perception (Per) characteristic,
so one way of improving your awareness of the environment is by investing
in this characteristic (see Chapter 3 for advice on purchasing attributes).
Another option is to raise the perception of a specific sense by investing
points in the Acute Sense (2 per level) advantage. Buy this separately for
each sense that you wish to improve (taste and smell count as a single sense
for this advantage).
You can see a bit more around you with the Peripheral Vision (15 per level)
advantage, which is particularly useful in combat. And if you think combat is
likely to occur at night or in dim light, the Night Vision (1 per level) advan-
tage is a good investment. Extending the range of a sense beyond the norm is
usually not available to normal humans — this is discussed more fully in
Chapter 10.
41
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Perceiving the other world
In a magical or occult campaign, the ability to extend your senses beyond the
mortal realm can be valuable. If you think you’ll be encountering ghosts or
need information from unusual sources, then these are the advantages for
you. However, you want to make sure that this functional role is useful to the
party before investing heavily in this area. Also, in a campaign with magic,
many of these abilities can be handled with spells rather than advantages
(see Chapter 7 for more information). All of the advantages in this section are
intended only for campaigns in which occult abilities are permitted; check
with your GM.
Communicating with spirits
Non-magical communication with the dead requires a greater understanding
of the GM’s worldview. Some GMs may rule that it is entirely impossible,
whereas others may make it very easy. The general category of spirits can
include the dead (ghosts), fairies, elementals, and angels/demons. You need
to find out from the GM which of these are likely to appear in your campaign.
You may also need to have a sense of the attitude of these spirits. Are the
local spirits likely to be friendly? Are they likely to be intelligent? And what
sort of spirits are there? The Spirit Empathy (10) advantage lets you sense
the intentions of and influence the spirits around you but not necessarily per-
ceive or speak with them. The Medium (10) advantage provides you with the
ability to sense spirits nearby and to speak with them but not to influence
them.
The Channeling (10) advantage allows you to open your body up to nearby
spirits, but it takes you out of the action. Spirits can use your body to com-
municate with the mortal world, but you have no control over your character
for the duration. You need to coordinate this advantage with other party
members for it to be useful. Note that this advantage in and of itself does not
give you any information about nearby spirits or control over which spirit
takes over.
Communicating with the natural world
If you are interested in playing a character slightly outside the norm, and
your GM allows communication with plants and animals, you might consider
the Speak with Animals (25) or Speak with Plants (15) advantages. Both pro-
vide useful sources of information and offer an opportunity to create an inter-
esting character particularly in tune with nature. The related advantage,
Animal Empathy (5), lets you sense the emotional state of animals in your
general area and to influence them through persuasion.
42
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Seeing through time
The Precognition (25) advantage lets you have glimpses of the future.
Although this sounds like an amazingly useful advantage, be very aware that
you have no control over the types of things you see or when you catch the
glimpses. This advantage is best viewed as a way of making a very useful plot
device available to the GM.
The Psychometry (20) advantage works in the other direction — you can get
a sense of the history of a place or object. You must be able to touch the
object and you must specify the time frame that you are targeting. On a prac-
tical level, being able to understand how a place was previously used can
give insights into where valuable items were likely to be placed. For epic cam-
paigns, this advantage can provide the party with insights into how their cur-
rent actions fit into the grand scheme.
Having a relationship with a higher power
The Blessed (minimum of 10) advantage represents a relationship with a
higher power that can grant you insights via visions. The advantage can be
extended to include the ability for the higher power to increase your attrib-
utes temporarily. If you have this advantage, followers of your higher power
will react to you favorably, but you do not necessarily have official standing
in any church hierarchy (for that, you need Clerical Investment and Religious
Rank). If you don’t want to be associated with a higher power, the Oracle (15)
advantage provides a similar ability through other mechanisms.
Other advantages used to represent the influence of a higher power include
the following:
 True Faith (15): True Faith gives you the ability to repel some supernat-
ural creatures (as determined by the GM), which is very handy if you
expect to be fighting the undead.
 Illuminated (15): This advantage lets you have insights as to the true
nature of the events around you, particularly as they relate to supernat-
ural happenings.
 Destiny (5, 10, 15): Destiny lets the GM determine your fate, but it
may also mean you receive deific assistance to aid you in achieving
that fate.
The ability to use clerical spells is granted by the Power Investiture advan-
tage, which is covered in Chapter 7.
43
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Increasing Your Skill
Advantages and skills frequently interact. For example, extending the range
of any one of your senses extends the range of any skill that uses that sense
(for instance, the Night Vision advantage and the Lip Reading skill give you
the ability to read lips in a shadowy alley or darkened theatre). Some of these
interactions are fun to discover during play, but the specifics of the advan-
tages in this section should be negotiated in advance with the GM.
Under the skill section on your character sheet, be sure to mark each bonus
to a skill and what advantage contributes to that bonus. When you list the
advantage, you may choose also to list each skill for which it applies; that
way, if you acquire a new skill during play, you already have a note to remind
you to add the bonus.
Higher Purpose (5) is an advantage with which any action associated with
your purpose gains a plus to skill. A Higher Purpose does not need to be spir-
itual in nature but does need to be specific and defined at the start of play.
One advantage that deserves special mention is Eidetic Memory (5, 10). In
campaigns in which the GM does not require a learning roll, good note-taking
on your part can mimic this advantage without you having to spend any
points. However, if you prefer the GM to do the note-taking and to remind you
of important facts, then this is the advantage for you. After the campaign has
started, Eidetic Memory is useful when rolling to determine whether you
have learned a new skill (if your GM requires such rolls), but unlike the third
edition, it does not add a bonus when calculating skill levels. 
Advantages related to specific skills
Several advantages directly affect how you can use one of your attributes.
For instance, the Flexibility (5, 15) advantage provides a bonus to any skill
that is based on being able to work in tight spaces. If you have the Flexibility
advantage, your dexterity is not adversely affected by tight spaces, and you
get advantages for squirming out of restraints. High Manual Dexterity (5 per
level) provides an improvement for your dexterity related to fine motor
skills, such as working with small objects — jewelry-making, surgery, clock
repair, and other such precise handwork.
Versatile (5) is a mental advantage that provides you with improved creativ-
ity, which comes into play when you are trying to use a skill to solve a prob-
lem. How much this advantage helps you with unfamiliar equipment or
finding replacements for missing items is up to your GM.
44
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Single-Minded (5) is another advantage that can add to your skill rolls. Ill-
suited for combat situations, this advantage allows you to focus intently on 
a task and generally do much better at it. Just be sure that you are in a safe
location or that someone else is watching your back because when you are
fully focused, you are likely to ignore any interruptions, like that charging orc
over there.
Talents
Any collection of skills can be grouped into a Talent with the GM’s approval,
though GURPS Basic Set: Characters lists a standard reference set on pages
89–91. In the short term, Talents can be useful for reducing the number of
points spent by grouping a set of six skills in which you have invested 2
points each. But Talents really come into play in the longer term and are
most useful for groups of skills for which you intend to invest more than 2
points in most of the skills in that group. Chapter 6 provides guidelines for
optimizing your points in this regard.
Talents also provide character depth either by making you a natural in that
area, by making you a trained expert, or both. In game terms, your character
gets a reaction bonus from other characters who are likely to recognize the
talent and appreciate it. You do not get such a bonus simply from having high
levels of skill in an area.
Bettering Your Social Standing
Many of the available advantages are intended to aid you in your role playing.
In some campaigns, situations may arise in which the party’s success or fail-
ure depends entirely upon whether one of the party members possesses a
particular advantage (such as Status). Social-standing advantages give you a
foundation on which to build a character who can gain entrance to the appro-
priate social setting and navigate adroitly in such environments.
Defining your social role
The importance of Status and Rank varies dramatically by campaign. An
adventure set in a culture with nobility or a strong military presence requires
careful thought about investments in these areas. An adventure that takes
place mostly in the outdoors far away from most people doesn’t require any
investment in these advantages.
45
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Social standing and rank
Rank (5 per level) is a general advantage that addresses the hierarchies 
that exist in many social structures. The military and most bureaucracies
have some form of rank system; each form of Rank is a separate advantage.
Clerical Investment (5) is required to possess Religious Rank and enter into
the church hierarchy.
Status (5 per level) reflects your character’s social standing. In some cul-
tures, this can be equated closely to Rank; in others, it is more related to
Wealth or simply to how well-known your character is. Status can determine
where your character is admitted and which people will accept him as an
equal (and, in some cases, which people will automatically reject or scorn
him). Social Regard (5 per +1 reaction) reflects the general social standing of
your character’s ethnic group, gender, race, and so on, in a setting, but not
his personal rank in society.
The Social Chameleon (5) advantage can serve as a replacement for Rank 
or Status if you have other ways of getting in the door. With this advantage,
your character tends to blend into whatever social situation she finds herself
in. But be careful — she always runs the risk of exposure, and the GM may
require you to role play your bluff into a given situation. This advantage is
particularly useful in campaigns in which you expect to be exposed to a vari-
ety of cultural settings.
Some advantages are very campaign-specific. Tenure (5) makes sense only
when academic institutions play a role in the adventure. And Unusual
Background (Variable) can be required by the GM to explain your character
having any advantages that are typically not available to normal humans.
Reawakened (10) is a special form of Unusual Background in which a charac-
ter acquires skills from a previous life.
Languages and culture
Cultural Adaptability (10, 20) provides a character with a general under-
standing of cultures, making any new culture that he encounters reasonably
familiar (take the high-cost advantage for similarity with non-human cul-
tures). For a more limited investment, your character can learn individual
cultures with Cultural Familiarity (1, 2). Either choice provides you with
knowledge of customs and behaviors — something frequently more useful
than the language itself.
Dealing with (or being) the Law
Legal Enforcement Powers (5, 10, 15) are advantages that provide for the
ability to enforce laws. On the other side of the coin is Legal Immunity (5 to
20) — for whatever reason, local laws do not apply to your character.
46
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Being able to acquire information from agencies of which your character is
not a member (and even within some agencies of which she is a member) is
based on the Security Clearance (Variable) advantage. The GM may require
you to specify the types of agencies for which your character has clearance.
Remember that not all agencies within a given government necessarily coop-
erate with each other.
Alternate identities
If you are concerned about how your character’s actions might influence his
social standing (or his relationship with the authorities), you can cover his
tracks by purchasing one or more Alternate Identity (5, 15) advantages. If a
character has no trackable identity, he is Zeroed (10). Alternate or Zeroed
identities are most useful in campaigns in which your opponent is the govern-
ment or a similar large organization.
Altering social interactions
A great many advantages pertain to the way in which an individual interacts
with others. These advantages can take the place of role playing in many situ-
ations, but the specifics are, you guessed it, up to the GM.
Influencing others
In any campaign in which social interaction plays an important role,
Charisma (5 per level) is probably one of your better investments. Each level
provides pluses to any skill involving influencing others as well as to reaction
rolls.
And in any campaign that involves extensive travel on a reduced budget or 
in which access to a particular subculture is critical, a Claim to Hospitality 
(1 to 10) is a significant advantage. Minor nobility, the Church, and academia
are all examples of the types of subcultures that recognize such claims.
Having empathy
Knowing the general emotions of those around you can be useful in just
about any type of campaign. Empathy (5, 15) works with others of similar
races and, in addition to general knowledge about the target’s emotional
state, gives you pluses to any skill that benefits from insight into the other
person (most notably, Detect Lies).
Animal Empathy (5) is most useful for those who will be working with a vari-
ety of animals, particularly wild beasts.
47
Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Resisting influence
In many situations, those you encounter in a campaign may attempt to influ-
ence your actions. The Indomitable (15) advantage lets your character shrug
off their attempts without even having to bother with the hassles of making a
resistance roll.
Appearance
The more Attractive (Variable) you are, the more likely the typical person is
going to respond to you in a positive way. Therefore, attractiveness is a type
of advantage, whereas a disturbing appearance is a disadvantage. In general,
we do not consider this a particularly useful advantage in most campaigns,
but it can make a character much more fun to play (after all, many of us
would love to have the looks of our favorite movie star). In order for it to be
useful, you need to be willing to exploit your character’s attractiveness and
use it to influence others.
A related advantage is Voice (10), which provides a bonus to any skill that
relies upon the sound of your voice. Singing is the obvious example, but
other useful skills include anything related to charming another person or
talking your way out of a tight situation.
Wealth
In addition to spending points to define your character, your character needs
to be able to purchase equipment. Each campaign has a standard starting
wealth that can be modified through the purchase of various advantages.
Wealth levels — Comfortable (10), Wealthy (20), Very Wealthy (30), Filthy
Rich (50), and beyond — adjust both how much money you start with and
how much money you earn through working. In many campaign settings,
having one party member with Wealthy or above can be very useful; how-
ever, there is no reason for more than one character in the party to have such
resources. Unless you have the Independent Income (1 per 1% of starting
wealth per month) advantage, it is assumed that you spend a significant part
of the normal week working to earn your money (managing your investments
if nothing else).
You can also reduce the amount of starting wealth you have with the Dead
Broke (–25), Poor (–15), or Struggling (–10) disadvantage. In general, the
items you encounter and the money you may acquire through adventuring
are not adjusted based on these modifiers (though there are disadvantages,
such as a Vow of Poverty, that may require you to adjust how much you
keep). Your success in business or other such ventures is aided (or limited)
by your Wealth level.
48
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

There are two ways to get more material possessions at the start of play. The
first is to trade character points for cash — one point is worth 10 percent of
the campaign’s starting wealth. The other is via Signature Gear (Variable),
which lets you directly spend points to acquire equipment, bypassing the
need for the starting money to purchase the equipment. Both of these advan-
tages can typically be used during play.
Patrons, Allies, and Contacts
One of the most useful long-term investments is in people who are likely to
help your character meet her goals. A character may have one or more of the
following to provide this support: 
 A Patron (Variable) is a powerful individual or organization that spon-
sors your character. Such sponsorship translates into access to both
information and equipment. In some cases, a Patron may also provide
support in the form of individuals to work with your party.
 Allies (Variable) work with your character in more of a support role. In
general, an individual Ally is slightly less powerful than the character
himself. Allies lend help in tough situations (including combat in some
cases) and share what information or resources they have available. You
may have a single Ally, a small group of Allies with distinct identities and
personas, or a fairly large group of interchangeable Allies; the larger the
group, the more points it will cost.
 A Contact (Variable) or Contact Group (Variable) is a less intense rela-
tionship — the relationship persists over time but not as an ongoing
association. The primary goal of having a Contact is acquiring informa-
tion. The Contact may grant access to restricted resources, such as legal
documents or secret information, but he will not involve himself directly
in the adventure.
All of these advantages both benefit the player and provide a useful plot
device for the GM. The cost of this support may be balanced by disadvan-
tages, such as Duties to the individual or organization, shared Enemies, or a
restrictive Code of Honor. The Favor (Variable) advantage can be used to rep-
resent a one-time resource with little commitment, rather than an ongoing
relationship.
The cost of Patrons, Allies, and Contacts is modified based on how much
help they can provide and how likely they are to provide that help. In general,
we believe that the more powerful an associate, the less frequently he should
appear. Otherwise, your character will come to depend on him and you will
find yourself calling for help rather than living the adventure yourself.

Chapter 4: Taking Advantages

Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Sample characters: Advantages
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
In my character’s business, knowing when trou-
ble is coming is important, so the first thing I
want for my 100-point character is Danger
Sense, which costs me 15 points. I’d also like to
be able to equip her well, so that means a bit
more spending money. It’s unlikely that I’ll have
20 points available to pay for Wealthy (though
I’d like to), so I’m going to just go with
Comfortable (10 points) for now. If I have more
points after I buy skills, I can always come back
and raise this. I’m going to set aside 10 points
for Contacts. I’ll need to talk to the GM about
specifics for these, but it seems like a good
investment for now. I also expect my character
will end up with a talent or two, but that will wait
until I have skills in place. As to perks, I bet she’s
read almost every horror story in print, so she
can provide author and character names for
any reference.
Bjoern’s Mage Character
Naturally, this character needs Magical
Aptitude, and I want this little guy to be tough,
so I give him Magery III, the maximum this cam-
paign allows, for 35 points. 
Now, I have to deal with that pesky Mundane
Background disadvantage. After conferring
with the GM, I have the first individual advan-
tage for this character — Unusual Background:
Trained Mage for 15 points. The GM insists that
I pay 15 points for this because it is highly
unusual in the game world for a halfling to be
trained, and I have to work this Unusual
Background into the character’s history. I like
the Signature Gear advantage, but what I want
(a Fine Mithril dagger) would cost 40 points —
more than I want to spend for something like
this, so I have to let that drop. These advantages
cost me a total of 60 points, which (if I take 
all the allowable disadvantages) gives me 91
points to spend. I might have the points left over
for a Familiar (whoo hoo!), which I discuss in
Chapter 7.
Adam’s Supers Character
Advantages are the centerpiece for a charac-
ter who has supernatural powers as a core con-
cept. I first need to decide on a source for my
character’s powers so that I can select appro-
priate advantages to match. After thinking about
it, I decide that she is a disciple of an ancient
snake god and gets her powers from this
source. Therefore, I want to give her advan-
tages with a snaky theme. She’s going to be pri-
marily a fighter, so I also want to give her
advantages that will help in that capacity. I
decide on Double Jointed, Combat Reflexes,
and Enhanced Parry. I decide she should be
beautiful, in the classic heroine tradition. The
rest of her advantages are built as supernatural
abilities and will be described in Chapter 9.

 Adjusting disadvantages with self-control modifiers
 Recognizing good disadvantages from bad disadvantages for your character
A
ll of the things that make life more challenging, from health problems to
mental disorders to social stigmas, are represented in GURPS as disad-
vantages. A disadvantage is a character trait that undermines or limits your
character’s abilities. It would seem natural that the wise player would want to
avoid disadvantages. Not so. For each disadvantage you take, you get points
back that you can spend on attributes, skills, or advantages. Your goal is to
take disadvantages that limit you in areas that are not central to your charac-
ter’s success in order to have the points to pay for things that are critical for
success. Not only that, but disadvantages can be fun to play!
As with advantages, as discussed in Chapter 4, some disadvantages are
intended to be used as part of a racial template rather than taken by individ-
ual characters. In GURPS Basic Set: Characters, these disadvantages are indi-
cated as either exotic or supernatural. Although a few are discussed in this
chapter (and indicated as requiring GM approval), Chapter 10 provides infor-
mation about working with these disadvantages. The disadvantages that
make sense only in a futuristic campaign are discussed in Chapter 9.
The information presented in this chapter is useful for deciding which disad-
vantages to consider. To help you compare disadvantages, the point value is
included in parentheses in the paragraph in which the disadvantage is
explained.

Before adding a disadvantage to your character sheet, make sure to read the
complete description in GURPS Basic Set: Characters. To help you find the
specific disadvantage, use the Disadvantages section of the Traits List on
page 299 in that book.
Getting the Point of Disadvantages
From our perspective, the most important thing about disadvantages is that
they are a large part of what makes playing a character fun. Just like with the
people you know, characters’ quirks and oddities make them interesting. 
The disadvantage of disadvantages
The least fun thing about disadvantages is that they really only count if they
limit what you’re able to do. The more a disadvantage is likely to be a problem,
the more points you get for taking it. Many disadvantages have a variable value
because you have to make decisions about the extent of the disadvantage or, in
some cases, work with the GM to determine how important the disadvantage is
likely to be in the current campaign.
Think back to your character concept and make sure you know the primary
function the character will serve in the party and any secondary areas. Then
step back and identify any areas that you really don’t care about. You proba-
bly don’t want to take any disadvantages in your primary area and want to
focus most of your disadvantages in those areas that aren’t critical. You may
also want to think about your character’s personality, both in terms of other
characters in the party and other players in the room.
Deciding how many disadvantages to take
The GM has the right to restrict the number of points in disadvantages any
character is permitted to take in the campaign. For higher-point campaigns,
we recommend that a GM set a limit to avoid creating a set of very powerful
and highly dysfunctional characters in your campaign. A limit of –40 or so
points is good for most campaigns, although it’s okay to allow a character to
take one big disadvantage worth more than –40 points.
If the GM does not impose a limit, then a rough rule to use is to take about
half the points of the campaign as the total of disadvantages and quirks. 
52
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

In some campaigns, a GM may introduce required disadvantages. Most 
commonly, these are elements that serve to bring the party together, such 
as a shared Enemy or a common Duty. Whether these disadvantages count
toward the campaign point limit is up to the GM. Racial templates (discussed
in Chapter 10) also have required disadvantages; remember that the racial
template disadvantages do not count toward any campaign total.
Adjusting disadvantages during play
Unfortunately, bad things can happen to your character during play.
Characters can get hurt, traumatized, or acquire vicious enemies. Even 
more unfortunate is that you as a player don’t get any points for these newly-
acquired disadvantages. On the other hand, the GM isn’t charging for the
fame and fortune that you acquire in your adventure either. These types of
disadvantages are usually temporary and often can be undone in the course
of the adventure — all you have to do is encounter a magical cure, get ther-
apy, or finally defeat the evil villain.
On the other hand, if you have gotten points for a disadvantage, you might
not want to have the disadvantage removed. As soon as the disadvantage
stops being a problem, you owe the GM those points back. Some GMs allow a
payment plan, but others may demand the points upfront. And, unlike credit
card offers, you can’t shop around and get the best deal. What your GM says
is the rule is, in fact, the rule. 
Quirks
Quirks are worth –1 point each and describe a minor aspect of your charac-
ter. Your character may have up to five of them. In general, a quirk has to be
something that limits your character’s actions or causes others to react to
your character differently. Quirks can be physical (such as mismatched eye
color), superstitious (avoids the number 5), mental (counts in different lan-
guages), or just plain annoying (drums fingers while talking).
You should always talk with your GM about quirks that you want to have
before making them a part of your character concept. In some cases, some-
thing that you consider a quirk may be something that the GM decides is
worth significantly more points (a superstition may become a phobia if the
situation is very common). In other cases, the GM may feel that the quirk
would be too annoying, either to other players or just to the GM.
Quirks are one part of your character sheet that many GMs let you fill in as
you play. We frequently start the campaign with five points in quirks (which
we’ve already spent on advantages or skills) and decide what our characters’
53
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

particular quirks are as play progresses. Sometimes a small incident grows
into a major component of the character’s personality by becoming a quirk.
Like disadvantages, quirks acquired during play do not give you more points
to spend.
Embracing Human Nature
The disadvantages in this section are the ones that give characters personality.
For the most part, these are the sorts of issues that you’ve probably observed
in coworkers and family members. And frequently, they are the sort of charac-
teristics that we use when we describe the essence of a person — he’s got a
bad temper, she always tells the truth, or he just never gets the joke.
You should think through how comfortable you’ll be playing a particular dis-
advantage. If confrontations make you uncomfortable, then you probably
don’t want to play a character that has a bad temper. Also keep in mind that
your character’s traits shouldn’t become your own. Just because the charac-
ter you’re playing is stubborn doesn’t mean you as a player have to be stub-
born when making plans with the other players.
Acting out — A matter of degree
The disadvantages discussed in this section are ones that most of us possess
to one degree or another. If minor enough, the characteristic may be a quirk
or not even worth mentioning. The more intensely your character is defined
by the trait, the more her actions become limited. In the course of the adven-
ture, as in life, it is sometimes in your best interest to act against your nature.
In those cases, you need to exert self-control to take an action that is counter
to the trait.
Most of the disadvantages in this section work with a modifier based on the
value used when making a self-control roll to go against the nature of the
trait. In order to act against the disadvantage, you must roll under the self-
control modifier value. Players may make such rolls in order to act against
the character’s nature or at the request of the GM. The lower the self-control
modifier value, the less likely you are to successfully roll that number and
thus the more limiting the trait is (and the greater the point value of the dis-
advantage). The cost listed for each disadvantage within this section (and in
GURPS sourcebooks) is for a self-control roll of 12. Using a self-control roll of
9 for a trait increases the value to 1.5 times that listed. Raising that value to a
15 halves the cost; lowering it to a 6 doubles the cost. In general, you should
consider any trait with a self-control roll of 6 to be one that you must be will-
ing to live with constantly (because you are unlikely to successfully roll to
behave differently).
54
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

The point values of disadvantages that have a self-control roll modifier are
indicated in this book by the term SCM following the point value.
There’s one in every party . . .
Some very positive character traits can become disadvantages in an adven-
ture setting. For example, the character who has Honesty (–10 SCM) is forced
to obey the law, regardless of whether he thinks it reasonable or not — no
crossing the street against the light, even when there are no cars (well, unless
you make your self-control roll, that is). A character with Truthfulness (–5
SCM) cannot tell a lie; she can avoid answering a question, but she can’t lie.
Two disadvantages that some players bring to each and every character are
Curious (–5 SCM) and Impulsiveness (–10 SCM). If you’re going to go ahead
and open the locked door and rush on through, you might as well take the
points for your character as well. Of course, rushing in is not always a very
good idea, so pay attention to the self-control roll value that you agree to.
Although the trait can be a tremendous problem in real life, playing a charac-
ter with Gullibility (–10 SCM) can be great fun. The GM usually likes it, too,
because your character can be told elaborate stories, and she’ll believe every
word — and act on them, too. As a consequence, be careful about what other
disadvantages you take with Gullibility (avoid ones like Impulsiveness).
Relating to other people
A wide range of disadvantages describe to what extent your character needs
other people around. For example,
 Shyness (–5, –10, –15): How easily one begins to interact with new people
 Loner (–5 SCM): How much one values one’s private time
 Chummy (–5)/Gregarious (–10): How much one needs interactions with
other people
A related disadvantage is Xenophilia (–10 SCM), which relates to how your
character reacts to individuals of other species or, depending upon GM inter-
pretation, other cultures.
Another set of disadvantages relates to how giving you are, both in terms of
your time and energy as well as your money:
 Miserliness (–10 SCM): This money-related disadvantage means you
hate to part with a penny and always seek the best deal.
 Greed (–15 SCM): This money-related disadvantage means you’ll do any-
thing for a buck.
55
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

 Gluttony (–5 SCM): This applies not to wealth but to craving food and
drink; a related disadvantage is Increased Consumption (–10 per level),
which means your character needs more sustenance (usually restricted
to exotic characters).
 Selfish (–5 SCM): If status is important to your character, then this dis-
advantage perhaps captures the feeling. Any slight to your status can
quickly give you the Bad Temper disadvantage.
 Charitable (–15 SCM): On the other end of the spectrum, this disadvan-
tage is less about money than it is about attitude. Your character hon-
estly wants to help those around him by sharing his resources.
 Selfless (–5 SCM): This is a trait similar to Charitable, but it comes into
play only during a conflict of needs, in which case you’ll sacrifice your
own needs to help the other person.
Taking risks
When evaluating risky situations, two disadvantages can dramatically change
your character’s options:
 On the Edge (–15 SCM): If you have this disadvantage, the fact that a sit-
uation is risky just makes it more attractive. After all, the bigger the risk,
the bigger the payoff. With On the Edge, your character can accurately
assess the risk and plan for it (including listening to the advice of other
characters), but won’t let the risk stop her.
 Overconfidence (–5 SCM): On the other hand, this disadvantage means
that you misjudge the risk. You are convinced that you can overcome
almost any obstacle, despite what other characters may try to tell you.
Be careful to avoid mixing Overconfidence with any other trait that
might make it difficult to work with other party members. It’s actually in
your overconfident character’s best interest if the other party members
care about preventing your character from being hurt.
Focusing on people, places, or things
Four disadvantages describe the negative ways in which a PC might respond
to a stimulus such as a place, a symbol, or any other identifiable item or col-
lection of items. In many campaigns, stimuli specific to the adventure may be
appropriate (for instance, in a real-world campaign, a fear of vampires is
probably a quirk, but in a horror campaign, it’s a valid Phobia).
 Phobias (Variable): Phobias are fears of something. When your charac-
ter encounters the object of her fear, you make a self-control roll. If you
fail, you then make a roll to determine the form your character’s fear
takes. Because you add the amount that you failed the self-control roll
by to your fright check, the lower the self-control value, the greater the
risk of extremely negative consequences.
56
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Even if your character faces his fear — when you successfully make your
self-control roll — your character receives a penalty to how well he is
able to perform any task. And any exposure to the object of the Phobia
is a stressful situation and so triggers any stress-related disadvantages.
If your character has a phobia, consider taking a quirk or two that relate
back to the fear — it makes it more fun to play. For example, you might
combine a fear of darkness (nyctophobia) with a quirk of always check-
ing the batteries in your flashlight or carrying both a flashlight and a
candle.
 Squeamish (–10 SCM): This is a specific disadvantage for the general
category of “yucky stuff.” It’s a fun disadvantage, and as long as you
have a reasonable self-control roll, it’s not likely to prevent your charac-
ter from being successful at most endeavors. You do, however, have to
respond in such a way as to limit your actions (mild panic, screaming, or
hysterical giggling can all work).
 Compulsive Behavior (–5 to –15 SCM) is the general category for addic-
tion to a type of behavior. If your character doesn’t have an opportunity
to indulge in the behavior, she suffers from Bad Temper until she gets a
chance to again immerse herself. Specific examples of compulsions
include gambling, carousing (partying), generosity, lying, spending, and
vowing, but you are allowed to create your own. The GM may impose
immediate negative consequences for having the compulsion in the first
place (for instance, someone with compulsive spending has a higher
cost of living). Compulsive behaviors are calculated both in terms of the
cost of the habit, the likelihood for it to disrupt life, and the value of the
self-control modifier.
 Obsessions (–1, –5, –10 SCM): These are goals that your character must
pursue — even when the rest of the party wants to go do something else
and when the pursuit is not in your character’s best interest. It’s not
enough just to talk about it; having an Obsession influences your charac-
ter’s actions as well. It’s entirely up to the GM as to whether an obses-
sion can ever be satisfied.
Use with caution
The set of disadvantages that can be most challenging to play are those that
run counter to the traits of a good player. In particular, the following disad-
vantages are very difficult to play unless you tend to nap through most of the
action:
 Incurious (–5 SCM): The opposite of Curious — your character has no
natural inclination to find out what’s behind doors or to try new things.
 Indecisive (–10 SCM): Your character has difficulty making decisions. In
fact, he tends to spend more time deciding than acting.
57
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

 Confused (–10 SCM): Your character has trouble understanding the
world around her, or at least new situations. This can be quite crippling
for a character and is just annoying to play because you have to limit
your own thinking.
 Clueless (–10): You just don’t get jokes. You may appreciate other forms
of comedy, but verbal wit is just beyond you. We tend to find that most
GURPS players are far from Clueless, and, for our players, the verbal
interchanges of our characters are a source of great amusement.
The GM may rule that the player of an Indecisive or Clueless character is
restricted in how much he can influence other players. Indecisive is not a dis-
advantage, for example, if you as the player get to be decisive and talk other
players into your course of action. We’ve always wondered why Incurious
characters ever leave home; make sure your character story explains that.
Sometimes you can conceive a character who’s a bit grumpy or not so nice to
be around. And of course, GURPS provides disadvantages for those situa-
tions as well:
 Bad Temper (–10 SCM): This disadvantage covers the entire range of
short fuses and hair-trigger reactions that can transform a simple greet-
ing into a barroom brawl.
 Intolerance (Variable): This is an active dislike for members of a specific
group. When you encounter members of this group, you don’t wait for
an excuse; you go out and start the problem.
The difficulty with these disadvantages is that they are traits that most of us
do not like to see in our friends. It can be a challenge for other players in the
party not to become frustrated with your character’s behavior.
Other difficult disadvantages include the following:
 Lecherousness (–15 SCM): This is a particularly tricky disadvantage in
some parties. If all of the players are comfortable with sexual situations,
and everyone has a good sense of humor, being Lecherous can offer end-
less opportunities for amusement (particularly when it is creatively
combined with other disadvantages, such as Shyness, Xenophilia, or
Impulsiveness.) The key is making sure that the players are comfortable
with this; the other characters don’t have to be, however.
 Short Attention Span (–10 SCM): This disadvantage requires extra work
on the part of the GM. If the character is supposed to be concentrating
on something, the player is also likely concentrating. That makes it
harder for even the most honorable player to remember that his charac-
ter can’t really concentrate. GMs should remember to step in and
remind players about making self-control rolls.
58
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

 Chronic Depression (–15 SCM): This is similar to Short Attention Span,
though a bit more troublesome because the GM could require a roll at
the start of any new action, particularly one that requires getting up out
of a chair.
Failing to fit in
Although how well your character gets along with the rest of the party is an
important factor to consider as you select disadvantages, you may want to
consider some that make getting along a bit more challenging. Most of the
disadvantages in this category won’t dramatically change what you are able
to do, but rather influence how you go about it. None of these, however, are
recommended for a character destined to play a primarily social role.
How you react to others
The individual with Low Empathy (–20) just doesn’t understand the emotions
and motivations of those around him, neither innocents that the party
encounters nor other party members. This means that he is at a disadvan-
tage with many social skills. 
The Callous (–5) individual may understand other people very well; she just
doesn’t care about them. The Callous disadvantage can create conflicts with
other party members who have traits like Charitable.
Jealousy (–10) makes social interactions a bit more awkward (particularly
with those of a higher social class or who are obviously more talented) but
doesn’t affect most of your day-to-day adventuring. The only time that it can
cause serious problems is if you become jealous of someone else in the party.
Limiting your own actions
Some disadvantages require more role playing skill than others. Not all char-
acters contribute to the party equally, and no matter how excited you as a
player are, or how much you want to contribute to the campaign, you may
limit your character’s abilities within the party with disadvantages such as
the following:
 Stubbornness (–5) is a great disadvantage for the annoying character
who won’t cooperate with the rest of the party. Keep in mind that this is
not the “stupidness” disadvantage. If a good plan is suggested, your
character should be able to (eventually) recognize that fact.
 A Guilt Complex (–5) is a relatively safe disadvantage in that it comes
into play only if something happens to those to whom your character
feels close. In that case, he becomes severely depressed and may try to
withdraw from the action.
59
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

 Laziness (–10) means your character wants to withdraw from the action
all the time. Most GMs allow that even lazy characters are motivated to
adventure because it’s supposed to be easy money; it’s only hard work
that a lazy person tries to avoid.
 Hidebound (–5) requires strong role playing abilities (or napping
through parts of the adventure discussions) because your character
cannot contribute new ideas. How much the player is limited in this
regard is up to the GM. We find this disadvantage almost impossible to
play. Hidebound does not prevent your character from acting on the
ideas of others.
 No Sense of Humor (–10) requires both good role playing, and,
strangely, the player has to have a very good sense of humor. The player
can laugh at jokes and should still have a good time, but the character
needs to be the perpetual straight man — never quite getting the joke
and setting everyone else up for humor. We’ve seen some great role play-
ing in which other characters have patiently tried to explain the joke
over and over again.
 Killjoy (–15) is a very different disadvantage in that the character
cannot feel any pleasure. The character with No Sense of Humor may
not laugh a lot but still enjoys life, even taking pleasure in the amuse-
ment of others. Not so the person with the Killjoy disadvantage. For that
character, life is always a flat gray with no peaks of enjoyment.
 Lunacy (–10) combines the Laziness disadvantage on the new moon
with a moderate degree of Impulsiveness or similar trait on the full
moon. If being tied to the moon is critical to your character conception,
this is a good disadvantage to take, but otherwise, the bookkeeping
required to track the phases of the moon tends to make it more of a
headache than a pleasure.
Delinquent behavior
Both Kleptomania (–15 SCM) and Pyromania (–5 SCM) can dramatically
affect the standing of the entire party in a social setting. In most cases, the
local community will blame the entire party rather than the specific individ-
ual for any crimes caused by these disadvantages. But each of these can be
great fun to play and can come in handy on adventures (you never know
when that little thing your character “picked up” may prove useful), and we
tend to have at least one of each per party. Note that both have self-control
modifiers.
Odious Personal Habits
An Odious Personal Habit (–1, –5, –15), frequently referred to as OPH, is a
catch-all for things that make other people react to your character in a nega-
tive way. You need to negotiate the specific point value with the GM before
play begins. Some OPHs are passive (such as a tendency to stare at people),
60
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

and the GM can assume that your character is always doing it. Other OPHs
are more active (a tendency to pick one’s teeth in public), and you need to
remember to include it in your character’s actions frequently. In either case,
a good player continues to mention the OPH when describing her character’s
actions. (If the rest of the party can join in when you start your description,
you’re doing a good job with incorporating the OPH.) If a specific behavior is
listed separately as a disadvantage, use that description and value rather
than crafting your own OPH.
Physical problems with social impact
In real life, you probably avoid being around certain people as much as you
can. In a GURPS world, you can make your character the one people (includ-
ing others in your party) try to avoid.
 Bad Smell (–10) means that people (including other party members)
tend to keep their distance. This disadvantage is relatively harmless
unless your character has to travel in a small vehicle along with the rest
of the party.
 Noisy (–2 per level) means that your character makes noise and actually
applies even when she’s not moving. This is particularly a problem when
one is trying to be stealthy but can be annoying at the best of times.
 The Social Disease (–5) disadvantage is one that we tend to not recom-
mend because, if your character is cured, you owe the points back, but if
he isn’t cured, the GM may be tempted to increase the physical symp-
toms, which certainly is going to kill his social life. This is definitely one
to talk over with the GM beforehand to define the particulars.
Vows, compulsions, and addictions
Grouping religious vows and addictions may seem a bit odd at first, but both
types of disadvantages describe things that your character must do regularly.
When taking these disadvantages, you lose some control over the day-to-day
actions of your character. The more control you sacrifice, the greater the
value of the disadvantage. 
Faith and duty
The most general disadvantage in this category is the Vow (–5 to –15 or
Quirk), in which your character has committed to an ongoing course of
action for a period of time. The more restrictive the Vow, the greater the
value. A Vow can be structured to require the performance or avoidance of
an action or set of actions. The same Vow may have dramatically different
values in different campaigns. For instance, unwillingness to ride a horse is a
major problem for anyone in a rural setting but is not an issue for someone in
61
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

a city. Any Vow can be ended during play, though the GM may impose restric-
tions on the process and, of course, you’ll need to pay off the points. One
approach to buying off a Vow is to replace it with a Secret, Reputation, or
Enemy disadvantage.
Disciplines of Faith (–5 to –15) can be thought of as a collection of minor
Vows or quirks that are grouped together; the focus is your own thoughts 
and self-actualizing behaviors relating to religious or philosophical beliefs.
Code of Honor (–5 to –15 or Quirk) is a closely related disadvantage, but the
focus is on your attitudes and behaviors to others. You can create your own
Disciplines of Faith or Codes of Honor, and they don’t have to be all about
quiet and calm life. The key is that the individual Vows and quirks share 
a common theme and help set a framework for the character’s general 
behaviors.
Although they sound similar, Duty (Variable) and Sense of Duty (–2 to –20)
are very different disadvantages. A Duty is imposed upon you based on your
relationship to another individual or organization. The responsibilities are
part of your job. A Sense of Duty is internally motivated and directed toward
a group of people, usually an obligation to protect them.
A disadvantage worth mentioning here is a Trademark (–5, –10, –15). The
point value of a Trademark is based on how difficult it is for you to leave your
mark and how much it increases your risk of capture. Slashing your initials
with your sword, writing a phrase on the wall in spray paint, and leaving a
single rose are each examples of simple Trademarks.
Diet and health
Both Restricted Diet (–10 to –40) and Increased Consumption (–10 per level)
refer to modifiers of what your character eats and drinks. If the impact on his
day-to-day life is noticeable, you probably should take one of these disadvan-
tages instead of or in addition to a Vow. Note that Increased Consumption is
not generally available to normal characters.
Maintenance (Variable) is a related disadvantage, but it refers to a service or
treatment that your character must obtain on a regular basis. Difficulty in
obtaining the service and frequency of the service determine the cost.
Addictions
Addiction (Variable) is the general category for addiction to a substance.
The value of the disadvantage is based on the cost, the legality, and the
effects of the substance (both of taking the drug and going without). Smoking
and drinking coffee on a daily basis can both be counted as minor addictions
in some campaigns. Note that you can have an addiction as a quirk if it’s criti-
cal for your character concept. Alcoholism (–15, –20) is a specific example of
62
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

an addiction. Overcoming an addiction in play frequently results in the acqui-
sition of a new disadvantage that is determined as part of the initial write-up
of the addiction (for instance, a tremor or mental problems).
Fanaticism (–15) is a very specific form of Obsession more suited to organiza-
tions or individual leaders. Fanaticism works in a campaign only if the GM
has created a world with a worthy organization for characters to focus upon
and is willing to invest in developing that as a significant part of the plotline.
Limiting Your Mental Abilities
If your character doesn’t need to rely on her wits, then these are the disad-
vantages for you. For a primarily physical character, these disadvantages add
flavor to the personality without particularly limiting usefulness. Even for the
“brainy” types, these disadvantages can be fun if they don’t interfere with
your character’s core competencies.
Characters who don’t need to worry about mathematics can take Innumerate
(–5), whereas characters who aren’t concerned about reading and writing do
well to take Dyslexia (–10). As long as someone else can lead your character
around (and you’re not playing in a cyberspace campaign), Non-Iconographic
(–10) — not being able to process abstract symbols like maps, magical sym-
bols, and graphical computer interfaces — is a good disadvantage to consider.
Depending on the systems being used, Dyslexia or Non-Iconographic or both
can prevent a character from becoming a mage.
In some campaign settings, being illiterate (having a language skill of None for
written comprehension only – 3) or semi-literate (having a language skill of
“Broken” for written comprehension only – 2) may also be available. If you’re
convinced that your character never needs to know anything and is only
normal in his DX and IQ, then consider the Cannot Learn (–30) disadvantage,
but we really recommend this only if your character is complete brawn.
Absent-Mindedness (–15) is quite fun to play. Your character can be very
intelligent; her mind just tends to wander. Note, though, that this is a very
dangerous disadvantage in any combat situation and limits all of your charac-
ter’s intellectual skills to only those topics of personal interest. She just tends
to forget what she’s doing at the moment.
Low Self-Image (–10) doesn’t cause any problems in normal situations, but
let a shadow of doubt creep in and your character will find herself having dif-
ficulty with most tasks. Specifically, at moments when the GM rules that your
character believes that she will not succeed, your skill roll is at a penalty.
Like Absent-Mindedness, this is risky in combat situations.
63
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

Tackling Physical Disadvantages
Physical disadvantages aren’t just for the noncombatants. Many great war-
rior figures have one eye or have taken such damage that their appearance is
altered in other ways. Also included in this category are those disadvantages
that have to do with getting a good night’s sleep.
64
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 
Avoiding anti-social tendencies
We tend to either disallow entirely or severely
limit a number of disadvantages. Several of
these are included in the disadvantages listings
primarily for GM use when creating villains.
Manic-Depressive, Megalomania, and Paranoia
add a grim element to any character and make
it more difficult for that character to function
within the party. We allow these disadvantages
but prefer that the character generally exempt
other party members from the dramatic ele-
ments of these characteristics. In other words,
it’s okay to believe that the rest of the world is
out to get you, but you should have at least min-
imal trust for your other party members.
Berserk, Bloodlust, Bully, and Sadism are all
disadvantages that easily come into play the
first time the party engages in combat. They are
directly in conflict with any Sense of Duty or
Vow that protects noncombatants, and they
also frequently go against the typical player’s
sense of fair play. Because we have seen argu-
ments erupt among players about the ethics of
actions taken under the influence of these dis-
advantages, we tend to disallow them unless
they are required for the character concept or if
everyone in the party is creating characters
with similar ethics.
Five disadvantages that we enjoy, but that
require a lot of work to incorporate into a cam-
paign, are Destiny, Enemy, Split Personality,
Trickster, and Weirdness Magnet. The main
problem in GMing Destiny and Enemy is coming
up with scenarios that target the single individ-
ual rather than spilling over to the rest of the
party (who didn’t get any points for the disad-
vantage). Split Personality and Trickster require
that you give the player opportunities to make
the best use of the disadvantage. Weirdness
Magnet requires that the GM continually come
up with unusual things to have happen to the
party. We recommend allowing only one of each
of these five disadvantages per campaign, and
only if you are the sort of GM who enjoys
coming up with interesting plot twists for indi-
vidual characters.
On a similar note, we have mixed feelings about
allowing Cursed, Klutz, Total Klutz, and Unlucki-
ness. They can add a sense of fun to a cam-
paign, but they force the GM to keep coming up
with negative consequences, and that’s difficult
to do without affecting the rest of the party or
having the situation become absurd.

Dealing with long-term illness
Two major physical disadvantages require negotiation with the GM:
 Neurological Disorder (Variable) is a catch-all for any disorder that is
not a wasting disease or physical damage. The effects are ongoing and
permanent. The GM determines the value of the disadvantage.
 Terminally Ill (–50, –75, –100) is meaningful only if the campaign is
intended to span a long enough period of time. You should take it only if
you really are willing to lose the character to the illness.
Looking not-so-good
Several disadvantages change the look of your character. Most of these
change only how other people respond to the character.
An unattractive appearance is a disadvantage ranging from Horrific (–24),
through Monstrous (–20) and Hideous (–16), to Ugly (–8) and finally
Unattractive (–4). The Appearance disadvantage relates only to how people
react to you initially. By itself, Appearance does not change your skills in
areas such as disguise or shadowing, nor does it increase the likelihood that
someone will recognize you. However, if you have Unnatural Features
(Variable), those skills are affected. Hunchback (–10) is a specific variant of
this and makes you even more easily identifiable.
There are two modifiers for size — Dwarfism (–15) and Gigantism (0). Each
makes you much easier to identify and more difficult to disguise. Gigantism’s
cost includes the advantage of being able to purchase ST and HP at a dis-
count, and this is reflected in the adjusted value.
You can also get points for your weight, ranging from Skinny (–5) to Fat (–3)
to Very Fat (–5). All of these limit your ability to disguise yourself and limit
the maximum HT that you may obtain.
Having trouble sleeping
Most campaigns involve action that spans many days or weeks. If you don’t
get enough sleep (either the player or the character), your performance suf-
fers. Although you don’t get any points for problems that keep you person-
ally awake, your character can. 
65
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

The requirement for Extra Sleep (–2 per level) is an absolute and is required
each day. Other disadvantages are more variable in when they take effect. If
you are a Workaholic (–5), your problem is that you may forget to sleep
because you are distracted.
If your character is a Light Sleeper (–5), he just has trouble falling asleep 
and may awaken during the night if there are any disturbances. With Light
Sleeper, you roll against your HT to determine whether he falls asleep, and
you make the roll only in uncomfortable or noisy surroundings. You can roll
again after a single hour without sleep. If your character is an Insomniac
(–10, –15), she is subject to episodes of sleeplessness. When an episode
starts, you make the roll against HT–1, so it’s slightly more difficult to fall
asleep. If you fail, you automatically lose two hours of sleep (or the entire
night if you really fail your roll). When it hits, Insomnia is much worse than
Light Sleeper, but you stand a chance of avoiding it for longer periods.
Nightmares (–5 SCM) can be either a simple disadvantage that’s basically like
Light Sleeper but rolled in the morning rather than before you go to sleep, or
it can be an opportunity for the GM to introduce sub-plots and allow players
to have mini-adventures in the character’s dreams. Being a Sleepwalker 
(–5 SCM) can be a real problem if the party is trying to hide out and catch a
nap. This can be a fun disadvantage for both player and GM as long as it isn’t
abused. Nightmares and Sleepwalker have self-control rolls, so their impact
depends on the self-control modifier value the player selects.
A Slow Riser (–5) also faces her problem in the morning, but this disadvan-
tage is all about taking longer to start the day. Note that having a party
member who is a slow riser pretty much forces the GM to at least occasion-
ally have the characters attacked at dawn.
Having sensory problems
Limitations on your character’s ability to perceive the world or to communi-
cate are generally relatively minor inconveniences. You have to be careful to
think about whether a particular sense is important either in the current
campaign or for your character, but most characters can make do with limits
to their senses.
Vision
In terms of vision, one of the easiest disadvantages to manage is
Colorblindness (–10). Be warned: It can get your character into trouble when
she’s trying to evaluate jewels or anything color-coded (such as when decid-
ing which wire to cut).
66
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Most other vision disadvantages come into play during combat. Night
Blindness (–10) is particularly problematic and is not recommended. Trust
us that any good GM will make sure that you have at least an occasional
battle at night if you take this disadvantage.
Restricted Vision (–15, –30) makes your character more vulnerable to attacks
from the sides. No Peripheral Vision (–15) reduces his arc of vision so that he
has no awareness of the areas directly to his left or right. Tunnel Vision (–30)
reduces this even further so that he has no ability to see other than almost
directly in front of him. This limitation can quickly become obvious to oppo-
nents in battle and is particularly a problem in melee situations. However, it
does not present as significant a problem if your focus is ranged attacks.
One Eye (–15) and No Depth Perception (–15) are variants on not having
binocular vision (the ability to judge distances). This is a particular problem
for ranged attacks but also reduces DX in any task requiring hand-eye coordi-
nation. The reduction is not as great, however, as it is for Bad Sight.
Bad Sight (–25) can be either nearsighted or farsighted. Both are going to
give your character problems during combat; it just depends on whether it’s
close combat (a problem for farsighted individuals) or a ranged attack (near-
sighted). From that perspective, we recommended nearsighted, though it
also limits your character in reading signs and other important sources of
information. Note that if you can correct the problem with technology, the
value is reduced to –10.
Blindness (–50) is the most dramatic of the vision disadvantages. Of course,
your character can compensate with a trained animal companion (particu-
larly a familiar for a mage) or by relying on other people. You cannot rely
upon technology without reducing the value of the disadvantage. Because
they have to be activated to be useful and don’t provide as much information,
the Scanning Sense and Vibration Sense advantages (if available) can be used
to compensate for the lack of sight, as can various magical spells and powers.
Hearing
Hard of Hearing (–10) characters are lousy scouts, but for most situations
can get along reasonably well. The GM may rule that you need to make rolls
to understand spoken instructions or your character may not get all of the
information when someone is talking to him. The creative GM can make this a
particularly challenging handicap.
Deafness (–20) is much more limiting and requires that you come up with
some other way of communicating with party members and others. Note that
knowing Sign Language or having the Gesture skill are useful only if those
around you also have that knowledge; the Lip Reading skill is probably the
better investment. If you use a skill, you are learning that skill as you use it
67
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

and will naturally advance in it. The GM may rule that technology can reduce
this advantage to Hard of Hearing or that the technology modifies the cost
(to –8 for corrected Deafness and –4 for corrected Hard of Hearing).
Other senses
No Sense of Smell/Taste (–5) is generally a fairly safe disadvantage, though
the creative GM can turn it against you in dramatic ways. Note that your
appreciation of food and drink is reduced, but you also aren’t bothered by
the smells of your surroundings or of others in your party.
Numb (–20) is mostly a problem when performing tasks that require hand-eye
coordination. It does not reduce the amount of shock or pain you take from
damage, and, again, a creative GM should find interesting ways to turn it
against you.
Motion Sickness (–10) comes into play any time your character travels in a
moving vehicle. It’s mostly discomfort unless you happen to end up in
combat on top of a moving train or on a boat or anything else the GM hap-
pens to come up with (and trust us, he’ll come up with something).
Having trouble talking
Stuttering (–10) negatively influences the reaction of those who meet your
character and can, at the GM’s discretion, slow down her communication. It
always reduces the skill in any area that relies upon clear speech. In a similar
vein, Disturbing Voice (–10) means that your character’s voice is not typical.
How it is different is up to you, but the overall effect is not an improvement.
If the problem is forming words, you can have either the Cannot Speak (–15)
disadvantage, which lets your character form sounds other than words, or
the Mute (–25) disadvantage, which prevents your character from forming
any sounds. In either case, you need to have another mechanism for commu-
nicating. The Gesture skill and or a knowledge of Sign Language are the two
most likely solutions, but realize that they require that another person also
has the same ability. You may find yourself writing quite a bit if you take this
disadvantage. Technology that allows you to communicate with sound
reduces the value to –10.
Having trouble with limbs
Reducing the functioning of one’s hands is represented by Ham-Fisted (–5,
–10), which reduces DX for any action involving fine motor skills, or Bad Grip
(–5 per level), which affects skill for anything that involves using one’s
68
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

hands. The penalty is slightly worse for Ham-Fisted but applies to a smaller
number of skills. Missing Digit (–2, –5) also reduces skills, this time for all
skills involving DX. Missing a thumb is much worse than missing one of the
other fingers and is not recommended.
If your character is missing an entire arm (One Arm, –20), she takes a penalty
for any task that normally uses both arms. If she is “only” missing the hand
(One Hand, –15), she can use the arm with a shield, so the value is reduced.
Any technological solution that reduces the inconvenience also reduces 
the value.
If a character lacks the use of one or both legs, he’s considered Lame (Variable)
with the specific value being based on the degree of loss. Having a leg that
doesn’t function (Crippled Legs, –10) means you suffer a penalty to any skill
that usually involves both legs (including melee and close combat), and your
Move must be reduced to half its normal value. If your character’s leg is miss-
ing (Missing Legs, –20), the penalty is greater, and you must reduce your
Move to 2 and use crutches or similar technology. If both legs are affected,
your character is either Legless (–30) or Paraplegic (–30), and your Move is
reduced to 0. Further mobility impairment is represented with Quadriplegic
(–80), which we do not recommend without powers that can make up for the
limitations (see Chapter 9). Technological solutions reduce the value if they
replace the leg; a solution such as a wheelchair does not fall into this cate-
gory. Note that when reducing your Move, you calculate the reduced cost of
the characteristic and do gain those points.
Risking a nasty surprise
Several disadvantages require a roll to determine whether your character is
struck by their effects. The roll can be required at regular intervals, when
your character performs a certain type of task, or when he is under stress.
The result of a failed roll is a reduction in functioning — either a loss of skill
or an inability to interact with the environment. We consider these disadvan-
tages to be relatively risky because they can strike during combat and make a
character completely vulnerable.
 Bad Back — Mild (–15) is triggered by any action requiring ST, and a
failed HT roll results in a loss of DX until your character can rest or get
help. In the case of Bad Back — Severe (–25), the roll is against HT – 2,
and you lose both DX and IQ. The loss can be reduced by having a High
Pain Threshold, but you also adjust the value by the cost of that advan-
tage. The GM determines which, if any, weapons you can use without
risking an attack of back pain.
 Chronic Pain (Variable) can range from mild pain that occurs rarely and
vanishes after an hour (–1) to agonizing pain that lasts for hours and
occurs frequently (–90). Mild pain is not a tremendous problem unless it
69
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

lasts for 8 hours and occurs frequently. Severe pain should not be taken
to occur with a frequency of appearing on a roll of 15 or less and proba-
bly should not last more than 4 hours an episode. We recommend taking
agonizing pain only when it appears infrequently (on a 9 or less) and
lasts 4 hours or less. In other words, don’t take Chronic Pain worth more
than –30 points unless you want it to be the focus of your character.
 Flashbacks (Variable) and Epilepsy (–30) are both triggered by stressful
events. The point value for Flashbacks is determined by the severity and
duration of the episode. The duration and severity of a particular epilep-
tic episode are determined randomly but, on average, are more exten-
sive than that for a Flashback.
 Phantom Voices (–5, –10, –15) are also triggered by stress but don’t
have a physical component; they can drive you mad and cause you to
perform unsavory acts, but your character doesn’t lose any coordina-
tion while doing so.
Fighting a Losing Battle
You might think it a bad idea to take anything that limits your abilities in
combat, and to some extent, you’d be right. But it can also be quite a bit of
fun, and most of the disadvantages in this section don’t really prevent you
from hurting your enemies. The key is to make sure that you don’t increase
the chances of your character getting hurt too dramatically.
Making it hard to fight
Pacifism (Variable) is actually a common and reasonable disadvantage for
many characters. In fact, it is a core characteristic of some types of charac-
ters. Pacifism doesn’t prevent a character from stopping his enemies, and
only in its most extreme form does it even prevent him from killing the bad
guys. We highly recommend Cannot Harm Innocents (–10) and Self-Defense
Only (–15) if they fit with your character conception. We also recommend
Cannot Kill (–15) because it doesn’t mean that your character can’t disable
an opponent.
We do not recommend Total Nonviolence (–30) because it is so limiting. Part
of taking any of the Pacifism disadvantage is trying to encourage others in
the party to not kill the opponents as well. Think carefully about how other
players will react to this. We generally don’t recommend Reluctant Killer (–5)
because of the skill penalties, but it can be reasonable if your character will
primarily play a support role in battle.
70
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Cowardice (–10 SCM) is an entirely different approach and affects only your
character’s ability to enter into battle. After the fight starts, your character is
actually extremely motivated to win. Keep in mind that part of going off on an
adventure is seeking out danger; failing a Cowardice self-control roll can
mean that you miss out on portions of the adventure.
Combat Paralysis (–15) is probably the most crippling of the combat-related
disadvantages. If you fail an HT roll (or roll 14 or greater regardless of your
HT), your character is stunned. This can mean that your opponents get a free
attack. And you cannot roll until the actual moment that the danger strikes.
Making it hurt more
Low Pain Threshold (–10) doubles the effects of any shock from damage; it
can be very crippling in combat unless you have a way of avoiding damage 
in most rounds. Being permanently Wounded (–5) makes this even worse
because it provides a target for the attack (and the resulting damage is multi-
plied by 1.5 before calculating the shock).
Susceptible (–1 to –20) does not make your character more vulnerable to
direct attacks but can make him more vulnerable to secondary damage and
attacks, such as poison gas. The value varies based on how common the sub-
stance is and the amount of damage that it causes.
Easy to Kill (–2 per level) is a risky proposition and is rarely worth it. It’s an
awkward disadvantage for the GM because, to make it really count, the GM
must put the character at actual risk of death on a relatively regular basis.
Making it harder to recover
Unfit (–5) and Very Unfit (–15) affect both your initial resistance rolls to vari-
ous types of attacks and your rolls to remain conscious and avoid death. You
also lose fatigue points (FP) at a greater rate for exertion (but not for spell-
casting or other effects that specifically draw on FP).
Post-Combat Shakes (–5 SCM) take effect only after it is clear that your char-
acter is going to survive. The problem is that the shakes make him useless in
helping the rest of the party clean up after battle, including hunting for trea-
sures or finding a way out of a desperate situation. However, this disadvan-
tage can be fun to play and generally is not too crippling. The cost can be
modified by adjusting the self-control roll as described previously, in the sec-
tion, “Acting out — A matter of degree.”
71
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

Slow Healing (–5 per level) is meaningless in campaigns in which technolo-
gies (including magic) are available for instantly restoring health. In other sit-
uations, it frequently means that the time between adventures is longer
(unless the GM chooses to push the party into situations unprepared).
Hemophilia (–30) is worse — your character continues to take damage from
any wound that draws blood. You also can’t have an HT higher than 10. In
many ways, Hemophilia in a combat adventure is just a strange form of
Terminal Illness.
Worsening Your Social Standing
Just as advantages can make your character’s life easier, disadvantages await
to make it even more challenging. Be cautious when taking these disadvan-
tages if social interactions play an important role in your adventure. Though
do keep in mind that good role playing (along with advantages such as Social
Chameleon) can make up for some of your character’s shortcomings.
Defining your social role
If your character starts out in an unfavorable position relative to the normal
person in society, this counts as a disadvantage. However, the possibilities
for disadvantages relating to social standing go far beyond simply being poor
or of a lower-class background. In particular, anything having to do with the
character’s relationship to society offers potential for disadvantages due to
secrets or misunderstandings.
Social standing
Status and Reputation are discussed in Chapter 5. A negative value for either
of these traits counts as a disadvantage. Keep in mind that the social stand-
ing of characters can influence what social situations are accessible to them.
A Social Stigma (–5 to –20) is a trait such as ethnicity, gender, personal
beliefs (such as religious affiliation), or past deeds (such as a criminal
record) that your character is unwilling or unable to change, and that causes
others in her society to react poorly toward her. Frequently, Social Stigma is
used to replace the Secret disadvantage if the Secret becomes known. Social
Stigma can interact with Status, Reputation, or both.
In campaigns in which unusual backgrounds are the norm, having a Mundane
Background (–10) can count as a disadvantage. Not only does it limit your
character’s abilities and knowledge while you have the disadvantage, but he’s
left with nothing to talk about during the cocktail hour.
72
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

Having an unknown past or present
The mysterious Secret (–5 to –30) is one of our favorite disadvantages. Even if
the rest of the players know the secret, it can still be fun to watch how it plays
out. Secrets can cover any aspect of your character — her past, her physical
being, her beliefs, her relationships. When defining a Secret, you must know
what the consequences of having the Secret revealed will be; these conse-
quences are used in calculating the disadvantage’s point cost (as is the likeli-
hood of your character’s secret being revealed). A Secret Identity (Variable)
is a special form of a secret that is worth more points if your character is of a
higher social class because the secret is more likely to be discovered.
The ultimate secret is Amnesia (–10, –25); your character doesn’t know the
details of his own past. In fact, at the higher value, you as the player may not
know all of the details. It is possible to have Amnesia as a Secret, and it is
also possible to have social standing with Amnesia (just because you don’t
know who you are doesn’t mean that others don’t). Don’t believe that having
Amnesia prevents you from developing a character background or role play-
ing; playing an amnesiac well requires as much if not more work than any
other character. Beware of having to pay Amnesia off, however, when your
past is revealed.
Altering interactions with others
Interacting with NPCs is a key part of most adventures, and a number of dis-
advantages influence those interactions. Some directly influence how NPCs
respond to your character (such as Easy to Read), but many come into play
as NPCs observe you interacting with your environment (such as when you
act upon a Delusion).
 Easy to Read (–10) makes it harder for your character to deceive others
and actually makes it easy for others to manipulate him by observing his
reactions. Playing a character that is Easy to Read requires making sure
that the GM and others really do know what’s going on with your charac-
ter. You can’t be a secretive player and be faithful to playing an easy-to-
read character.
 Fearfulness (–2 per level) also makes your character easier to manipu-
late, but only in situations in which Intimidation is being applied. The
more general application of this disadvantage is anytime that a situation
is startling or frightening and you must make a fright check to determine
your character’s reaction. This is a general attitude and, unlike
Cowardice, is not related to combat.
 Oblivious (–5) refers to how well your character understands what
drives other people and relates mostly to influencing others and being
influenced. Note that it is not about understanding their emotions; that
disadvantage is Low Empathy.
73
Chapter 5: Finding Your Hero’s Flaws

 Mistaken Identity (–5) definitely changes a character’s interactions with
others, but not in any way that can be controlled. The GM needs to
invest in making this disadvantage interesting without making it so
threatening that the risk outweighs the relatively small value of the 
disadvantage.
 Delusions (–5 to –15 or Quirk) are true to your character and false to
others. If your character tells others about his Delusions (and he no
doubt will), their reaction to him is likely to be reduced. Furthermore,
Delusion may cause your character to react in unpredictable ways
because of the beliefs he forms about the individuals he meets. If he
thinks the merchant down the street is actually an agent of the King,
he’ll need to find a different merchant to use.
Surrendering your self-will
Slave Mentality (–40) is a very tricky disadvantage to permit in a campaign
because it means that the character is very limited in her actions due to her
relationship with her “controller.” If the controller is an NPC rather than
another player, it can be an interesting disadvantage that the GM can use to
his own ends. In some cases, with players who enjoy working closely on their
characters, a partnership can be formed such that the disadvantage is also
workable. But, in general, we don’t recommend using this disadvantage.
Wealth
The various levels of Wealth are discussed in Chapter 4. One thing to keep in
mind when taking a lower level of Wealth is that it affects your character’s
ability to earn money throughout the campaign, not just the amount of
money he starts with.
Creating problems with other people
Characters don’t exist in a social vacuum. Just as positive forces in any char-
acter’s life contribute to her success, other individuals in turn require sup-
port or actively work against the character’s success. Both dependents and
enemies provide excellent plot devices for the creative GM. And both must
be fully negotiated with the GM prior to the start of play.
Supporting dependents
Calculating the cost of a Dependent (Variable) requires taking into considera-
tion the Dependent’s point cost relative to your character’s, his relationship
to your character, and his frequency of appearance. The value for the
74
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS 

disadvantage comes from the fact that the dependents are at risk. Keep in
mind that the GM gets to determine the dependent’s actions, so you can’t
count on them going to safety when your character orders them to (think
teenagers and parents). Magic users have an opportunity to take a familiar as
a dependent (see Chapter 7).
Recognizing enemies
Everyone has an enemy or two, but not every character has an Enemy
(Variable). How powerful your character’s Enemies are and how serious they
are about coming after him determines how many points they’re worth as a
disadvantage. In some campaigns, all of the characters may share an Enemy
as a required disadvantage. Enemies are also very useful for replacement dis-
advantages in the event a Secret becomes known or a Vow must be broken.
We recommend keeping the total point value under 15 for a personal Enemy.
Anything of greater value than that both puts the entire party at risk and may
require the GM to frequently adjust her plans to address your character’s
Enemy seeking him out.
Keep in mind that when the Enemy disadvantage is paid for by an individual,
the Enemy should target that character rather than other party members. 
Having trouble with a deity
Although the GM is the only omnipotent power in a GURPS campaign, he may
have a few deities at his disposal to wreak havoc on your characters. The fol-
lowing two disadvantages bring those higher powers directly into your char-
acter’s life, and not in a good way:
 The Divine Curse (Variable) disadvantage definitely indicates that your
character has annoyed a higher power, and She’s out to get him. Your
character might not have done something personally to irritate the
gods; he might be cursed simply because of his family or even his
nation.
 Destiny (Variable) means that the higher power is meddling in your
character’s life, and the consequences are not going to be to his liking.
Both of these disadvantages require coordination with the GM, who may dis-
allow either or both of the disadvantages entirely or may request or require
one or the other to provide a plot device for the GM’s use.

Sample characters: Disadvantages
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
Without a doubt, she’s Stubborn and Curious.
Curious has a self-control modifier, but I’m going
to take it at the default so each of these costs
only –5. I keep thinking about a limp, but that
would cut her Move in half, so I’m not willing to
risk it as a full disadvantage; I can treat it as a
quirk (at –1), though. I see her with glasses for
being Nearsighted, so that’s Bad Sight with a
60% limitation, making it –10 points. Looking
through the options, I think No Sense of Humor
might be fun to play, and that’s another –10
points. I’m going to try to have –40 points in dis-
advantages plus –5 or so in quirks. Pacifism
(Cannot Harm Innocents) seems like a good
constraint on her behavior, and it’s –10 points,
so that rounds things out. As for quirks, I defi-
nitely see her playing with her rosary a lot, and
she always dresses like a 1950s gumshoe. I’m
thinking she supports herself writing stories
about what she encounters, so perhaps she’s
always taking notes. That’s three quirks, and our
GM lets us add more as we play, so I’ll leave two
blank for now.
Bjoern’s Mage Character
I need to come up with –100 points in disadvan-
tages and –5 points in quirks. I’ve chosen 3
quirks at this time, and the GM is going to let me
save the points for the other two and figure
them out during play as I get to know the char-
acter. The disadvantages are more important
and more significant. I know I want this charac-
ter to be basically a “nice guy,” so after perus-
ing the list of disadvantages, I’ve come up with
the list you can see on page 93.
I decided to give this guy Weirdness Magnet
(–15), not only because it can be a lot of fun, but
also to help explain why this halfling character
was able to get training as a mage. I also gave
him a –20 point Enemy, which I’ll let the GM
decide the identity of, but I didn’t pay for Secret
Enemy, so the GM will need to let me know who
is after my character before the campaign
starts (I hope). The GM wouldn’t let me get
away with the Social Stigma amongst other
halflings because he’s a mage. Apparently, that
either comes with the territory or it has already
reduced the cost of the Unusual Background.
Either way, it won’t work; so I had to come up
with a replacement — Truthfulness for –10
points.
Adam’s Supers Character
The campaign has a limit of –40 points for dis-
advantages. Trying to stick with her snake
theme, I gave her Bad Temper, but at a level she
can control fairly well (a resistance roll of 15). I
also gave her Gluttony, which seems to keep
with a snake’s eating style. I picture her as
brash, so I gave her Overconfidence. I decided
to give her Sleepwalking, which is something I
think the GM can have fun with and could prove
interesting for me. Because she is supposed to
be a good guy out to save the world from forces
of evil, I gave her Cannot Harm Innocents.
Lastly, I gave her a Code of Honor as the basis
of her religion. This will be important for her
other powers, as I show you in Chapter 9.

Chapter 6
Finalizing Your Character 
with Skills
In This Chapter
 Selecting appropriate skills for your character
 Calculating skill levels
 Making final adjustments to your character points
T
he attributes, advantages, and disadvantages you select for your charac-
ter determine the potential of that character as well as the foundation of
his personality. What that character will be able to accomplish is mostly
determined by the skills that you select for him. Each skill that your charac-
ter has is represented by a base skill level. For any particular task, that skill
level may be modified by the situation (such as darkness, complexity, or the
types of tools available).
For most actions in the campaign, you roll three six-sided dice and then com-
pare the result to your modified skill level to determine whether you were
successful at the task. If the number you roll is equal to or less than your
modified skill level, you were successful. For some skills, how much you suc-
ceed by (the modified skill level minus your roll) determines how well you
actually did.
Generalist characters tend to have many skills at moderate levels (12–14),
whereas specialist characters tend to have fewer skills but at higher levels
(14–16). Frequently, we select one or two skills as the focus for a character
and make sure to have those skills at an extremely high level (17+). Combat
skills are a special class of skills that all characters have to consider; they’re
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 11. Mages take each of their spells as a
skill, which is discussed in Chapter 7. All these aspects of skills are discussed
in the first part of this chapter.

Increasing attributes, adding advantages, and selecting skills are all very easy
tasks when it comes to creating a character. Picking disadvantages is a bit
tougher, but only because you have to limit what your character can do.
Toughest of all is getting the character’s point value to match the campaign’s
limits. In order to balance your points, you’ll probably have to give up some
advantages, reduce your abilities in some skills, and perhaps even take addi-
tional disadvantages. But when you’re done, you’ll have a completed charac-
ter ready to begin her first adventure. The last part of this chapter shows you
how to put the finishing touches on your character.
Deciding Which Skills to Take
The first thing to realize as you begin selecting skills is that, as in real life,
your character is probably not going to be able to do everything you want
her to do as well as you want her to do it. There simply aren’t enough points
to cover all the bases, and if there were, you’d probably be tempted to spend
them on attributes or advantages instead of on skills.
In Chapter 2, we introduce the idea of your character’s functional role —
identifying what your character would contribute to the party’s success.
Taking that a step further, you may want to identify a single skill or very small
subset of skills that you will focus on developing as the campaign progresses.
Not only does that help in deciding how to spend your points during charac-
ter creation, but it gives you a direction for your character to develop.
We suggest you begin by writing down all of the skills that you think are rele-
vant to your character’s functional role, adding any that are appropriate to
the campaign setting, and then adding any that appeal to your sense of the
character. After you have created that list, you can reduce it to a manageable
level by prioritizing the various items. In this case, a manageable level is a
number of skills (including any for combat or magic) less than approximately
one-third of the campaign’s point total. When you are done with your charac-
ter, you will probably have one-third of the campaign’s point total invested in
your skills but because some skills will have more than one point, you will
have a fewer number of skills.
As you work with finishing your character, you’ll want to compare the points
in various areas to make sure that you have both kept all the basics that you
need and covered all of the areas that you want. We find it useful to do this in
an electronic format, either in an MS Excel spreadsheet or an MS Word docu-
ment. The advantage of the spreadsheet is that you can sort things more
easily; the advantage of the simple document is that you don’t have to know
how to use a spreadsheet. Chapter 13 gives more advice on managing your
character sheet.
78
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

GURPS Basic Set: Characters organizes all of the skills alphabetically, which
makes it much easier to find things for reference. But when you are looking at
creating your character, it’s also useful to be able to consider the skills based
on categories. In the following sections, we provide two such collections
(sorted by those appropriate to common functional areas and those appro-
priate to typical campaign settings). Steve Jackson Games offers a very good
list organized by type of skills on the e23 Web site (e23.sjgames.com, search
for “skill categories”).
Selecting skills based on your 
character’s role
One very useful reference for finding skills appropriate to your character’s
role is to look for character templates that are similar to what you want yours
to be. The ones in GURPS Basic Set: Characters provide a good starting point.
You may not want to build your character on a specific template, but you
may see some of the less common skills you want to have. Also, consider
whether you are willing to lock your character into a single role or whether
you want to have enough variety in your skill set to allow you to function in a
variety of situations.
Fitting into society — Cultural skills
In a campaign in which gathering information is important, being able to fit
into society can be critical. Among the skills that are useful in almost any
social situation are 
 Diplomacy (negotiating a resolution)
 Fast-Talk (the art of the con)
 Savoir-Faire (knowing the proper behavior).
For those interactions that take place in a darkened bar, the appropriate
skills are Carousing and Gambling (and what good campaign doesn’t eventu-
ally end up in some dive somewhere?). And for those actions that take place
in even more unsavory surroundings, Streetwise might be the more appropri-
ate social skill.
Of course, you’ll need to have some idea whether the information that has
been provided is actually true, so the Detect Lies skill is also crucial. Even
more crucial is remembering to use it to check someone’s story during play.
Being able to get information out of someone (not necessarily through violent
means) is covered by Interrogation, whereas being able to get someone to do
something for you through threats is covered by Intimidation.
79
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills

Frequently, your character can gain entrance to a variety of social situations
by having a very high level of skill in an area such as Musical Instrument,
Singing, Performance, or Artist that makes him a “star.” Most GMs also
require that you pay some points for a Reputation advantage to be able to
use your position to gain favor. If you simply wish to appreciate the arts, then
the Connoisseur skill is more appropriate (and can be applied to areas out-
side the traditional arts as well).
Dancing can be particularly important in some cultures with certain types of
events, such as a Grand Ball, requiring the ability to participate in order to be
accepted.
The four Enthrallment skills (Captivate, Persuade, Suggest, and Sway
Emotions) and the Musical Influence skill are special in that they allow you to
influence others through the force of your will. Make sure that the GM allows
these skills before making them an important part of your character. And if
you’re the GM, think carefully about how these skills will change your campaign.
Hitting the streets — Sneaky skills
The same basic set of skills is appropriate for your character whether he’s a
thief, a spy, a private investigator, or just very streetwise. Most campaigns
provide an opportunity to take advantage of these skills, and in many, they’re
absolutely necessary. In addition to the skills in this section, a number of
social skills (particularly Fast-Talk and Detect Lies) are appropriate, as would
be a knowledge of a variety of languages and areas.
We’ve already mentioned Stealth as a skill that we believe everyone should
have. Being able to follow someone is covered by Shadowing (keeping the
person in sight) and Tracking (following his trail). Hiding an object (or your-
self) outdoors is covered by the Camouflage skill. The skill to counter your
foes’ use of any of these skills is Observation, which is also highly recom-
mended. Another good skill to have with Observation is Lip Reading so that
you don’t have to get so close to overhear the secret plot.
The ability to hide an object on your person is Holdout and the skill that
works against it is Search. Being able to quickly access such an object is
Sleight of Hand (probably one of the most overlooked skills — yet a surpris-
ingly useful one).
If you wish to impersonate others or even just modify your appearance, you
need to consider the Acting, Disguise (or Makeup), and Mimicry skills. In
order to successfully impersonate someone else, you need all of these at rea-
sonably high levels.
And what sneaky character would be complete without the skills for finding
hidden doors and unlocking them? Architecture includes the ability to find
hidden structures (such as doors). Traps is useful both for creating traps of
your own and for making sure the door is safe to open. And then, of course,
80
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

Lockpicking is necessary for getting the door open. Unless, of course, you’ve
met someone with the key, in which case Pickpocket might be even more
useful! And if things go wrong, Escape is a useful skill for getting out of ropes
and other restraints.
Scrounging is the ability to locate things that your character needs — not
necessarily exactly what she needs, but something that will work for the situ-
ation. For instance, if she’s trying to pry open a blocked doorway, she might
not find a crowbar but rather a long piece of metal that will work nearly as
well. Filch is the ability to take things you need or want without being
noticed; rarely legal, but often useful.
Many sneaky people are quite financially successful, but sometimes it’s fun to
play a character that lives by her wits on the rough streets. For such a char-
acter, Streetwise, Panhandling, and Urban Survival are all important skills.
And no discussion of sneaky spy skills would be complete without mention-
ing a knowledge of Poisons. Note that knowing about poisons includes knowl-
edge of how to treat them but not necessarily knowledge of how to obtain
them in an urban environment.
Weighing, analyzing, and fixing — Nerdy skills
The skills in this section improve your character’s ability to gather and
understand information.
Intelligence Analysis is a general-purpose skill that lets your character see
patterns in large amounts of data. This can be particularly useful in revealing
enemies’ plans but is equally useful when deciding to break into a building.
Accounting and Administration are more specialized skills that let your char-
acter understand information related to money or organizational structure
(as well as being able to apply the corresponding practical knowledge).
Cryptography is a very specialized skill that relates to codes (creating, using,
and breaking). Check with your GM to see how relevant any of these skills
will be within a given campaign.
Many campaigns benefit from someone with knowledge of the basic sciences
and the ability to do research within them. Criminology and Forensics can be
the most fun and the closest to investigative skills within the sciences (as
demonstrated by a variety of television shows). Naturalist is a particular skill
that can come into play if your character spends time in the wild. And in a
low-tech campaign, Naturalist is a pretty good “catch-all” of a foundation in
all of the natural sciences.
Medical skills of all sorts are useful, though we generally recommend focus-
ing on the Physician skill and taking defaults from there. In an environment
that lacks supernatural forms of healing, having a physician in the party can
literally be a matter of life or death.
81
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills

Many of the other sciences can be useful but are most appropriate for a char-
acter with a scientific or inventive focus. Any inventing that takes place in a
modern setting probably has focus on Electrician, Electronics Operation,
Electronics Repair, Engineer, Machinist, or Mechanic because they provide
the skills for building the technology we are most used to seeing. Weird
Science is a specific skill that gives you the scientific understanding of the
strange events that normal publications are afraid to report. Astronomy,
Biology, Chemistry, and Physics are general science and can have specializa-
tions, but creating new theories or inventions is time-consuming.
Facts, figures, and faces — Know-it-all skills
We take for granted a certain level of knowledge about our own society. In a
campaign, it can be very useful to represent that knowledge with skills such
as Area Knowledge, Current Affairs, Heraldry, History, and Geography. For
understanding other cultures in your own world, Anthropology is frequently
a good choice (depending, in part, on the opinion of the GM as to the breadth
of this field). Research is a general skill that lets you find out information
from existing resources. The ability to invent and to do creative research is
covered by the corresponding “nerdy” skills discussed previously.
Writing is a general communication skill, but it is particularly important for
anyone who will produce reports for other people to read. Teaching is useful
for helping convey knowledge to those interested in learning or improving
their skills.
Being physical — Rough-and-tumble skills
The skills in this section are related to athleticism and physical training.
Acrobatics is a skill that can be substituted for DX in a variety of situations
(such as jumping or falling). You can also take advantage of acrobatic skill
when dodging an attack. Brawling is another useful physical skill that pro-
vides for a variety of basic attacks with hands and feet; think of it as the gen-
eral unarmed combat skill. If your character is at all the physical sort, he
should have both Acrobatics and Brawling.
Several skills, specifically Climbing, Jumping, Lifting, Running, Swimming, and
Hiking, allow you to perform specific physical tasks. Which of these will
prove useful in a campaign depends upon the type of terrain that you are
likely to encounter. The Survival skill requires specialization in a terrain type
but is a necessary investment for any character who expects to spend signifi-
cant time living outdoors.
Knowing the unknowable — Occult skills
If the campaign allows for the occult or supernatural, invest wisely in the
Exorcism, Hidden Lore, Occultism, Religious Ritual, Thaumatology, and
Theology skills. In these cases, a little knowledge can be much more effective
than weapon skills. This is particularly true if your GM rules that your char-
acter doesn’t know about silver bullets unless you have one of these skills.
82
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

Selecting skills based on setting
Another approach that we recommend when deciding upon skills is to evalu-
ate what skills the typical person in that setting or time period would likely
have had. Those general skills are ones that your character should have
acquired just from growing up in society.
To get a sense of what we mean, browse through the skill list summary found
on page 301 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters and identify those skills that you
consider yourself to have at a level that reflects some study or knowledge in
the skill. Most of us have a general sense of history and geography, the bio-
logical and physical sciences, driving, computer operation, and perhaps sev-
eral academic areas. Those skills are general to our time and place.
Our experience is that most GMs expect the players to adjust their charac-
ters’ knowledge to reflect the time and place. Thus, in a Victorian campaign,
your character is expected to have no knowledge of modern science, even
though you as a player may be quite knowledgeable. It is also possible for the
GM to adjust the “normal” level of knowledge for skills by defining what sort
of ability is associated at a basic level. We frequently use a skill of 12 to
reflect the basic societal level of knowledge in a skill. Thus, a GM may decide
that a Dancing skill of 12 in Victorian England includes several formal dances,
whereas it includes only moving to the beat in a Modern setting.
Medieval campaigns
Characters in a medieval setting will have a set of skills much different than
those in a modern setting. People at a lower tech level are more likely to have
skills associated with living off the land (such as Naturalist, Survival, and
Weather Sense), for example, as well as skills related to managing animals,
such as Animal Handling, Riding, or Teamster. And of course Farming!
Those who interact with the upper levels of society are likely to know
Heraldry. People are more likely to have a good grasp of the geography and
customs of their local area but a very general understanding of a wider area,
and this would be reflected in the types of Area Knowledge that they have.
Most characters embarking on an adventure have skills in both a melee and a
ranged weapon. And because doctors are few and far between, most charac-
ters would have some form of First Aid.
Victorian campaigns
The Victorian and Elizabethan eras are periods of low technology but more
centralization into the city. Individuals in the country may function at a lower
tech level, and those in the city are likely to have a variety of social skills
focused on large social events. Such skills could include Makeup, Dancing,
Savoir-Faire, and Writing; appearance and decorum are major aspects of social
83
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills

standing. Both gentlemen and ladies will still have Riding, but their styles will
be very different (with the lady riding sidesaddle and for pleasure). Men of all
classes and women of the lower class would also have Teamster (though the
type of vehicle would differ from class to class).
Modern campaigns
The exercise of recognizing what skills you personally possess will definitely
help with modern campaigns, but we strongly suggest a minimum of
Computer Operation and Driving. Few modern people are familiar with close
combat or bladed weapons, but most people at least believe that they could
shoot a gun accurately.
Futuristic campaigns
The key thing to consider for futuristic campaigns is the environment, and
that generally means some specialty of the Environment Suit skill (most often
Vacc Suit) to protect from environmental hazards. Free Fall is also a good gen-
eral skill to have in a space-based game. Piloting is more useful, in general,
than Driving, and most people who travel are likely to have some level of one
of the Crewman skills. You are more likely to use a Beam Weapons, a Force
Sword, or a Force Whip skill than the traditional Gun skill.
Fantasy campaigns
If the campaign is in a fantasy setting, the characters are likely to have some
knowledge of Hidden Lore or Occultism. Some characters may have magical
knowledge (Thaumatology or spells).
Occult campaigns
With an occult or supernatural campaign, knowledge-related skills are the
most useful — specifically Hidden Lore and Occultism. Because many inter-
actions will come down to attacks against your Will (IQ), Mental Strength and
Autohypnosis are very useful. The Hypnosis skill can also be very useful as is
Exorcism, if it is appropriate for your character. If the GM will permit your
character to have them, knowledge of Religious Ritual, Ritual Magic, and
Symbol Drawing are all important, too.
Calculating Skill Levels
After you have created your list of skills, a good next step is to calculate your
skill level with one point in each of the skills. The description for each skill
(as well as the summary table of skills found on page 301 of GURPS Basic Set:
Characters) lists the attribute used for each skill (the base attribute) and the
difficulty level of the skill (Easy, Average, Hard, or Very Hard) as well as any
84
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

formula for calculating defaults for that skill. As you go through your skills
calculating your starting level, note any formulas for defaults.
Also note that some skills are marked as requiring specialization. For many of
these, you may wish to have the skill in several areas of expertise (for exam-
ple, Armory — Small Arms and Armory — Melee Weapons). Track each area
of specialization as a separate skill. 
You calculate your skill level with one point by using the difficulty level listed
for the skill to determine how to adjust the base attribute. Most skills are
based on IQ or DX. One point in Easy skills gives them to you at the same
level as the base attribute. Each increased level of difficulty lowers the start-
ing skill level by 1. So, if you are looking at a skill that is IQ/E (based on IQ
with an Easy difficulty level), then your skill level with 1 point is the same as
your IQ. If it is IQ/A (also based on IQ but with an Average difficulty level),
then your skill is IQ–1. Skills that are Hard are –2 and Very Hard skills are –3
with 1 point.
After you’ve calculated all of your skill levels with 1 point, calculate any
defaults that you want to keep track of. Mark those defaults that are based on
another skill so that you can identify those pairs of skills that are interrelated
(with one being based on the other). That way, if you change the points in a
skill that is used to calculate a default, you’ll know to update the other skill 
as well.
85
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills
Using a spreadsheet to calculate skill levels
If you are comfortable using a spreadsheet pro-
gram, you can easily write a formula to calcu-
late skill levels. Select a portion of your
spreadsheet to hold the attribute levels. Use
one column to record which attribute is used for
calculating the skill (IQ or DX), another to record
the skill difficulty (E, A, H, VH), another to record
the points invested, and a final one to record
any adjustments to the skill level (such as those
based on a secondary attribute or from an
advantage or disadvantage). Use a series of
nested IF statements to compare the text values
and then multiply the points invested as appro-
priate. The following sample formula gives you
a good starting point based on just IQ (in cell B1)
and DX (in cell D1). 
=IF(C2>=1,
IF(A2=”IQ”,$B$1,IF(A2=”DX”,$D$1,
”ERR”)))
+IF(B2=”E”,0,IF(B2=”A”,-1,
IF(B2=”H”,-2,IF(B2=”VH”,-3,
”ERR”))))
+IF(C2<1,”ERR”,IF(C2<2,0,IF(C2<
4,1,INT(C2/4)+1)))
+D2

Pluses from advantages
Now go back to your advantages and identify each skill that benefits from a
particular advantage. Mark down the amount of the bonus and also make
sure to indicate where the bonus comes from. That way, when you’re adjust-
ing your total points, you’ll be able to see what would happen to your skills if
you got rid of a particular advantage. We strongly recommend color-coding
related skills, including those that share bonuses from the same advantage.
Techniques
Finally, identify any techniques that you wish to acquire. A technique is a spe-
cific application of a skill. It is tracked separately and uses a different formula
for calculating the skill level. In general, techniques relate primarily to
combat styles, and many characters will have none.
Bonuses from defaults
You can get a reduction in the cost of raising a skill if the skill level from a
default is higher than the skill level would be with 1 point invested in the
skill. As described on page 173 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters, calculate the
default level for the skill based on one attribute and then figure out the
number of points required to raise the skill to the same level using another
attribute. The difference between the two is the bonus you get on learning
the skill.
For example, imagine a character with an IQ of 14 and a DX of 9. Because
Stealth is an Average skill based on DX, 1 point gives it to you at DX–1, or 8.
Normally, to get your skill to a 9, you’d need to spend 2 points, and to get it to
a 10, you would spend 4 points. But Stealth also has a default of IQ–5. So, for
this character, the default based on IQ is 9 (14–5) — the same as having spent
2 points to raise the skill. Those 2 points are your bonus from the default. It is
as though you have two “free” points invested in the skill. You can now raise
your Stealth to a level of 10 by spending only 2 points (rather than the 4 it
would have cost you without the bonus from the default).
86
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

Adjusting Your Character Points
Now for the hard part. At this stage in your character’s creation, all the
points you’ve allotted are invariably out of balance. You have to get your
character’s point value to match the campaign’s limits. After you’ve drafted
your character with all the attributes, advantages, disadvantages, and skills
that you’d like to have, it’s time to see how much adjusting you need to do.
The next few sections show you how. Be sure that you have included any
combat-related items (see Chapter 11) and any costs from magic or powers.
Adjusting for the world
When you have a rough idea of your character and before you begin worrying
about balancing points, you should review your character sketch to make
sure you have all of the requirements for the campaign.
Review any material provided by the GM for a list of required advantages or
disadvantages. For each advantage and disadvantage, make sure to check
whether it applies to your point totals and any adventure limits (such as a
limit on the total points you can have in advantages).
If you are using a racial template, make sure that each advantage and disad-
vantage is properly recorded on your character sheet and that they are
appropriately accounted for in your totals. In general, we recommend that
you not record the point values for individual items that come from a tem-
plate but do be sure to record each one (without the point value). Be sure to
mark these items as coming from a template (using a different color works
well) and to record the point value of the template somewhere.
Make sure you’ve met any required minimum skill or attribute levels. This is
particularly important for weapons, which frequently have a minimum ST
requirement.
Adjusting your point total
Total up all of the points spent in the various categories and see how that
compares to the point limitations for the campaign. Don’t worry if you’ve
overspent — overspending is perfectly normal, and to fix it, you just need to
make some adjustments.
87
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills

Taking every point
If, as is likely, you have spent more points than you were supposed to, the
first thing to do is make sure that you have gotten all the possible points
available to you. Check to see whether you have taken the full complement of
disadvantages allowed by the GM. If not, look for additional ones that you
would consider adding to your character. Also, check to make sure that you
have taken quirks. Many GMs allow you to leave empty slots for up to five
quirks to be filled in as gaming progresses.
Making sure your character is competent
Review your skill levels to see which ones need to be raised. Starting with 2
points rather than 1 point raises your skill level by 1. Starting with 4 points
raises it by 2 levels. After that, raising your skill level costs 4 points for each
increase of a level. So with a DX/Easy skill, 1 point gives you a skill level equal
to your DX, 2 points is DX+1, 4 points is DX+2, and then you can add +1 for
each additional 4 points (DX+3 is 8 points, DX+4 is 12 points, and so on).
For each skill that is specific to a type of equipment, make sure that you have
indicated familiarity (if appropriate) for that type of equipment, and also
make sure you have a plan for acquiring the equipment (see Chapter 9, for
more on that topic). Familiarity comes into play when a skill requires equip-
ment that comes in a variety of models. Cars and guns are the two most
common examples. You get starting familiarity with two models for each
point you invest in the skill.
Giving up your dream
If you have spent too many points, the time has come to decide what items
you are willing to give up.
If you are way over, look first at your advantages. Are there any that you
could let go of without having to dramatically change the way you envision
the character? If so, scratch off the most expendable one and recalculate
your points. Repeat until there are no more that you’re willing to sacrifice.
Then look at your attributes. Can you lower your attributes (or secondary
characteristics) without changing your character concept? Perhaps your
character wears excellent armor and so can afford to have fewer hit points. Or
if you’re a talented mage, perhaps you have horrible DX. Adjusting attributes
is an effective way to free up significant numbers of points. 
If you are just a few points over, look at your skills. Are there skills that you
could keep at their default levels? If so, remove any points that you have
invested in them. Do some skills seem like they’d be fun, but you’re not sure
exactly how you’d use them? Are some skills very similar? If so, reduce the
total number of skills. Repeat until you have a set of skills at levels that you’re
comfortable with.
88
Part I: Getting Started with GURPS

If you are concerned about maximizing your points, we recommend next that
you look at your DX and IQ and how they relate to your skill levels. Looking
separately at the skills based on each attribute, count the number of skills in
which you have 2 or more points. If you have more than 20 such skills based
on IQ or DX or 10 such skills based on any other attribute, you can benefit
from raising the attribute and reducing the number of points in each skill. To
be precise, what you want to total is the number of points that you have
spent in raising each skill to the most recent skill level. So if you have five
skills that have 8 points in each, you can lower them by 4 points each and
raise your attribute for the same cost. Obviously, if you have more skills
based on the same attribute, removing points from the skills and raising the
attribute actually saves you points. But even at the same cost, it is a worth-
while approach because it raises any default skills based on that attribute
and, in general, reduces the cost of raising those skills in the future.
Also look at the number of related skills you have that have 2 or more points
in them. Consider whether you have more than 5 points invested in raising
the skill levels in those skills beyond the first point. In other words, look to
see whether you have one of the following:
 Six skills with 2 points in each
 Three skills with 4 points in each
 Two skills with 8 points in each
If so, investing in a Talent will be a more cost-effective way of having the
same skill level (plus there are other advantages such as Reputation). See
page 90 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters for a list of suggested Talents.
The only disadvantage to a Talent is that it can reduce the number of models
of an item with which you are familiar.
You may need to repeat the process of adjusting your character a number of
times. If you begin to feel frustrated, take a break and think about what’s
important to you in the character. That may help you identify things that you
can let go of or reduce. You can also speak with your GM about whether there
are aspects of the character that aren’t necessary for the campaign. Have fun
creating your character and don’t worry if you don’t have everything you
want to start with — a good GM will give you a variety of opportunities for
character development.

Sample characters: Skills and point balancing
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
When I am ready to work on skills, I make sure
that everything is in a spreadsheet that will keep
track of my point totals and calculate skill levels
for me. That way, I can see how many points I
have available at any moment. I want Jessica to
be able to take care of herself, so I’d like both
Judo and Gun at a skill of 15, but Judo is a hard
skill, so that gets expensive (a skill of 15 would
cost 24 points). So I’m going to go with Judo at
12 (12 points) and Gun at 14 (also 12 points
because it is an easy skill). I have 60 points in
IQ, 36 in advantages and perks, –45 in disad-
vantages and quirks, and 24 points in combat
skills. That leaves me 25 points for the various
other skills.
I also see her as reading Latin but not speaking
it other than for phrases to drive away spirits, so
I take Broken Speech/Literate, which is 4 points.
I want to give her all of the available occult
skills, basic forensic skills, and some academic
skills, so I give her Current Affairs, History,
Criminology, Forensics, Naturalist, Exorcism,
Hidden Lore, Occultism, Thaumatology, and
Theology. First Aid and Driving will also proba-
bly come in handy. Given that I’m thinking she
earns her living writing up her adventures for
the tabloids, I also want her to have Writing.
And for a reporter and an investigator, Fast Talk
would be handy.
At this point, my spreadsheet tells me I still have
8 points to spend. I prefer to list a variety of addi-
tional skills that I frequently reference, so I’ll go
through and calculate all of their defaults next.
Looking at those, I remember that Fast Draw
has no default, so I want to add that. And I can’t
imagine her surviving with the defaults in
Stealth (8) or Shadowing (8), so I put a point into
each of those. Tough PIs also probably are
Streetwise, so that gets a point, and someone in
the party had best have Merchant, so I’ll add
that. That leaves me three points, which I use to
increase Fast Draw, Driving, and Merchant. For
the specifics of the skills, see the character
sheet on page 92.
Bjoern’s Mage Character
Before I ever start purchasing skills for a mage
character, I first get his spells down, which I did
in Chapter 7. After going through the list, I came
up with 37 skills that I want for this character,
and, for simplicity’s sake, I put 1 point in each
skill. You can see the list of my choices on his
character sheet, located on pages 93 and 94.
Now it’s time for me to start balancing the points
for this character. Oops, I’m 22 points over the
200-point limit for these characters, which
means that something has to go. Well, I always
expected that a Strength of 8/10 was asking for
a bit much, so I cut that down to a strength of
7/9. That saves 10 points; 12 to go. Looking at the
skills I took for this character, I guess a halfling
with Erotic Arts is a little sick, and Connoisseur
is a bit much, so those can go. Likewise,
Thaumatology might be a bit hifalutin for a start-
ing halfling character; he can pick it up later if
he wants it. He doesn’t need Lockpicking
because he has the Lockmaster spell, so that
skill is history; 8 more points to go.
On the magic side, I can easily get rid of the top
end of the Healing spells I gave him — he’s a
Combat Mage, not a Healer. That saves 3 points.
And likewise, he can lose Final Rest (and hopes
it doesn’t come back to “haunt” him). The
Grease spell might be good for comic effect, but
that’s about it, so it can go. I can’t really see this
little guy using the Ethereal Body spell (with its
very high casting cost) to great effect, so I elim-
inate that. Light Jet is a nice effect, but super-
fluous with a lantern, so I cut that, which leaves
me at 201 points.
It hurts to do it, but given that it is a hard combat
skill, and one that this character is not likely to
spend much energy improving, I can eliminate

91
Chapter 6: Finalizing Your Character with Skills
Judo without affecting this character much.
And that gets us to the 200-point limit. And the
character — Halfling Mage Opie Mossytoes —
is ready to go.
Adam’s Supers character
My natural inclination is to not devote too many
points to skills in a new character. A character
can learn new skills or put points in old ones
fairly easily, but most advantages are not avail-
able after character creation. I often set aside
20–30 points and do as best I can with that
number. Because this is such a high point cam-
paign, and because I want to have a high
combat skill, this time I set aside 40 points.
A few things are mandatory. She must have skill
with her magic whip (see Chapter 9), or there
isn’t much point in having it. She also must have
skill in using her Affliction ability. I gave her
Acrobatics, which can give a bonus to Dodge,
and Brawling, which can be useful for a number
of combat things that I might have to make up at
the spur of the moment. 
Her background includes being an archaeology
student, so I gave her skills in Archeology,
Paleontology, and Research. I filled out her skill
list with a few other things I believe will come in
handy.

Enhancing Your
Character

In this part . . .
W
e discuss the different ways you can create an
enhanced character — someone with abilities
beyond the ordinary. Each chapter addresses a different
type of enhancement: magery and magic in Chapter 7,
powers in Chapter 8, technology in Chapter 9, and playing
nonhuman characters in Chapter 10. To get an idea of the
breadth of characters available within GURPS, read all
four chapters.
If you know what you want, then you can just read the
chapter that is relevant to your character choices (within
the parameters of what your Game Master allows for the
campaign). However, when you are ready to start purchas-
ing equipment for your character, we suggest that you
read Chapter 9 — regardless of the Tech Level of your
campaign — because it can help you decide what sort of
purchases you should make.

S
pells and other magical effects are the cornerstone of fantasy adventure.
With the Magery advantage and the right spells, you can create a sor-
cerer fighting off monsters with a few well-placed fireballs. But magic users
aren’t all-powerful — each spell must be learned individually, and you need
to think carefully about how you invest your points to ensure that your char-
acter has the breadth of abilities necessary for your campaign.
Although the variety of magic users presented in fiction and mythology is
quite extensive, ranging from witches of Western Europe to the wizards of
fantasy to priests with divinely granted abilities, almost all of them can be
represented in GURPS within the same framework of advantages, skills, and
mana (the energy used to power magic). The exception would be those with
magical powers that are developed using powers rather than Magery (see
Chapter 8). In this chapter, we use the term mage to describe a character
with the Magery advantage.
This chapter shows you the basics of using spells and magic items in GURPS.

Using Magic in GURPS
In GURPS, spells are skills that have magical effects. Magery (5 + 10 per
level) is the advantage that allows characters to cast spells. Strictly speaking,
having Magery is not an absolute requirement for spell casting because any
character can use some simple spells in areas of high mana. However, in prac-
tical terms, if you want your character to be a powerful user of spells, you
want to buy the Magery advantage.
At its basic 5-point level, Magery simply gives you the ability to use spells.
Each higher level of Magery gives you a bonus to all your spell skills. The
more powerful spells may require higher levels of Magery to use, with the
hardest spells requiring a Magery level of 3.
There is no maximum level of Magery, but you may want to put a cap on it. In
third-edition GURPS, the maximum level was 3, and that is a pretty good stan-
dard unless you want really powerful magic users in your campaign.
Spells are generally powered by fatigue points (FP), which start out equal to
your Health (HT). You can also power spells with external sources of power —
such as powerstones and ceremonial magic, which are discussed later in this
chapter — but you want to make sure that your character has enough FP to
be effective as a mage. For this reason, good magic users tend to have rela-
tively high HT, have purchased additional FP (at 3 points per level), or a com-
bination of both. Abilities for recovering FP more quickly, such as the Breath
Control skill or the Recover Strength spell, are also particularly useful for
mages. (Note that the Fit advantage allows you to recover FP at an acceler-
ated rate only for physical activity, not for spell casting.)
The mechanics of spell casting
At the most basic level, spells are simply skills. To cast a spell, you roll
against your skill with the spell. Spells, however, have a number of character-
istics that aren’t like other skills.
Spells all have a cost, which is the number of points of energy the mage must
expend to cast the spell. Mages may spend their fatigue as energy, but energy
can also come from magic items such as powerstones; see the sidebar, “So
what powers magic anyway?”.
Some spells can also be maintained. Maintaining a spell means putting more
energy into it at the end of its duration so that it doesn’t end as it normally
would. For example, without maintaining the spell, Basic Illusion lasts a
100
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

minute. If a mage creates an illusion that he wishes to last longer than a
minute, he could extend this duration by paying periodic “maintenance”
energy costs. Duration is fairly self-explanatory; it’s the length of time that the
spell lasts after your character casts it.
Spells also are listed with a time to cast (the number of turns of concentra-
tion, with no other action, required before your character can release the
spell) and often have prerequisites (requirements the mage must meet to qual-
ify for learning the spell). Usually, prerequisites are other spells the mage
must learn first, but sometimes specific levels of Magery are required, and in
a few cases, other advantages (such as Empathy or High Pain Threshold) or a
minimum in a specified attribute are required.
Magic and mana level
Mana is the energy of magic in the surrounding environment. It determines
how easily magic can be used in that particular area. Regardless of mana
level, the caster must know the spell as a skill before using it (unless the GM
allows for alternatives). There are five levels of mana:
 No mana: In areas without mana, spell casting is impossible.
 Low mana: In low mana areas, all spells are cast at –5 to skill.
 Normal mana: There is no bonus or penalty to any magic abilities in
normal mana areas.
 High mana: In high mana areas, people without Magery can cast spells
that don’t have Magery as a requirement. These are only the simplest
and most basic spells.
 Very high mana: In very high mana areas, magic users recover the
fatigue they spend casting spells instantly at the beginning of their next
turn. This is really cool, although it is somewhat mitigated by the fact
that in a very high mana zone, any failed spell roll is automatically a crit-
ical failure — with spectacularly disastrous results for the poor mage.
And, of course, you still must have the energy points to initially invest in
the spell.
Each level has an effect on how magic works. Mana levels may vary from one
place to the next or may be consistent throughout the universe. This is up to
your GM to decide, and it is important to have this information as you begin
designing your mage.
101
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 

Magic and skill level
As your character masters spell skills at higher levels, they become easier
and quicker to cast. The breakdown is shown in Table 7-1.
Table 7-1
Effects of Skill Level on Casting Ability
Skill Level
Effect
9 or less
You must use an elaborate ritual to cast spells, and the time to cast
listed under each spell is doubled.
10–14
The spell works according to the write-up.
15–19
You get a reduction in Fatigue cost of 1 point.
20–24
Casting time is halved, although it still takes you a minimum of 1
second, and your Fatigue cost is reduced by 2.
25–29
Casting time is divided by 4, and Fatigue costs are reduced by 3.
It is really worthwhile to get your spells to a skill level of 15. The one-point
reduction in Fatigue might not seem like much, but it can allow you to cast
some simple spells for free and, more importantly, to maintain them for as
long as you want without running out of Fatigue. All spells are IQ-based, and
most of them are Hard, with a few that are Very Hard. This means that if your
character has an IQ of 14 and Magery 3, he learns all IQ/Hard spells at a mini-
mum of 15.
102
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 
So what powers magic anyway?
The actual mechanics of how GURPS spells
work can be a little confusing. Mages must
spend “energy,” which is measured by points of
fatigue, but there is also this stuff called “mana”
floating around that seems to be important.
The actual way it works can be up to the GM,
but an easy way to think of it is this: Magic is
powered by a magical energy called “mana”
which is available in the environment. Mages
must force this energy into a spell to power it,
but it is hard work, and thus requires fatigue to
be expended. Thus, energy is measured in units
of fatigue required to control it. Magic items like
powerstones and manastones make the mana
much more available to the mage, and so they
don’t need to expend fatigue to use mana stored
in such items.

The different types of spells
Spells are grouped into several categories:
 Regular spells: This is the most common category of spells. They affect
only one subject and do not have much range (the mage is at –1 to cast
the spell for every hex between herself and her target). If the target is
bigger than human-sized, it costs the mage extra fatigue; see GURPS
Magic, page 11, or GURPS Basic Set: Characters, page 239.
 Area spells: These spells can affect multiple targets. The cost listed for
area spells is the cost for an area of a single hex. For larger areas, multi-
ply the base cost by the radius of the area you wish to affect (2 x for a 2-
yard radius, 3 x for a 3-yard radius, and so on).
 Melee spells: These spells charge your hand or magic staff with a harm-
ful force that affects your targets when you hit them. Unlike regular
spells, your character must touch his target for the spell to work, and
also unlike regular spells, the spell stays around until you do, rather
than dissipating right after you’re done casting it.
 Missile spells: These are spells that you throw over a distance. You
don’t have the –1 per yard range penalties you have with regular spells
(although you still have the normal range penalties associated with dis-
tance attacks). Be sure to take the Innate Attack skill so you can use
these spells.
 Blocking spells: These are spells that can be cast instantaneously and
act as a defense against an attack.
 Information spells: These spells let you divine knowledge in some way.
The main feature of this category is that the GM rolls for you and gives
you information according to how well she rolls. On a critical failure, the
GM will lie to you.
Some spells are successful as long as you make your skill roll. But spells that
affect others, particularly those that can be used as an attack, can frequently
be resisted or dodged. Spells that can be resisted list the attribute by which
they can be resisted. This means that when you cast this spell on a target, the
target can attempt to resist it by winning a Quick Contest (using the relevant
attribute) against the roll you made to cast your spell. For example, say you
know the Body of Air spell at a skill of 15. Body of Air is resisted by HT. You
cast it on your foe and roll a 12, beating your skill by 3. Your target must now
roll 3 or more under her HT score to resist the spell. If she does, your spell
fails to take effect.
103
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 

Ceremonial magic
Casting a spell is usually just a matter of rolling against your spell skill and
keeping track of your expended Fatigue. Sometimes, however, you’ll want to
cast a spell that you don’t have enough Fatigue to manage. This is the time
for ceremonial magic.
If you know a spell at a skill of 15 or better, you can cast it with the help of
assistants who can contribute energy to the spell. Anyone can be an assis-
tant, but not everyone can contribute energy equally. The breakdown is
shown in Table 7-2.
Table 7-2
Assistants’ Contributions of Fatigue

Mages who know the spell with 
As many points of Fatigue as they feel like

parting with

Up to 3 points of Fatigue

Non-mages who know the spell

Unskilled assistants
Can each contribute only 1 point to the spell.
No more than 100 unskilled assistants can be
used to cast a spell.
104
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 
Other forms of magic
The standard magic system isn’t your only
option. Mages need not rely on a set list of
spells skills. GURPS Magic lists several options
for the GM to consider — Improvisational
Magic, Syntactic Magic, Symbol Magic, and
Ritual Magic. These systems are all optional
and require both the player and the GM to be
flexible.
Because these systems are optional, and
because they are largely customizable by the
GM, these systems fall outside the scope of this
book. If, as GM, you are interested in incorpo-
rating one or more of these systems into your
campaign, they are well worth looking over.

Casting a spell by using ceremonial magic multiplies the casting time by 10.
For more details, see the sidebar in GURPS Magic, page 12, or on page 238 of
GURPS Basic Set: Characters.
Deciding Your Magical Focus
With many dozens of spells available, mages in the typical campaign have to
focus on a subset of the available spells. If your character is a mage, which
spells should you choose? Several approaches exist, but the three that we
prefer are
 Orienting the character around a specific magical profession, such as
healer or battle mage
 Selecting spells that share a specific relationship with the magical
energy, such as a nature mage or a necromancer
 Identifying a single highly advanced spell or small collection of spells to
use as the core abilities of the character
Within GURPS, spells are arranged by college, a general category defined by
the focus that all the spells in the college relate to. For example, the elemen-
tal college of Air contains spells that all have to do with air in some way: Walk
on Air, Summon Air Elemental, Shape Air, and so forth. Colleges are definitely
useful as a way of focusing your magic use; one way to do this is to arm your
mage with spells culled from a single college. However, we find it more enjoy-
able (and more effective) to combine several colleges when creating a char-
acter. (Also, many advanced spells within a particular college require
knowledge of spells from a different college as part of their prerequisites.)
The concept of a mage with a focus on a particular type of magical energy is
one used frequently in fantasy literature and is well-suited for use with the
colleges within GURPS Magic. Creating a collection of colleges around a type
of magic energy is a very subjective process — any two people might create
their lists differently. If your GM has created such a list, however, keep in
mind that this defines how the game world works; it’s no longer a subjective
opinion but rather a fact for the world of the campaign. Some examples of
groupings of colleges based on such a focus are as follows:
 A nature mage with spells from the Animal and Plant colleges also might
have some spells from Body Control and Healing (because humans are
just one form of animal).
 An elemental mage with Earth, Air, Fire, and Water spells also might have
Light & Darkness and Sound spells.
105
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 

 A mage associated with how things work might have Body Control,
Making and Breaking, and Technological spells.
 A mage specializing in optical effects might have spells from the Illusion
& Creation and Light & Darkness colleges.
Organizing your spells around a profession requires thinking about how the
various spells might be applied in a society that relies upon magic. A very
interesting way to tackle this problem is to think about common roles in our
own society and then transfer them to a magic society. Some examples of
roles might include
 A private investigator type of character with spells from the
Communication & Empathy, Knowledge, and Protection & Warning 
colleges
 A performance artist type of character with spells from the Illusion &
Creation, Light & Darkness, and Sound colleges
 A transportation expert type of character with Gate and Movement
spells
 A doctor type of character with spells from the Communication &
Empathy, Healing, Necromancy, and Mind Control colleges
Often, you will create your mage character with some particular spells in
mind that you really want him to cast. By focusing on a few specific advanced
spells, you end up defining your character around those spells because
you’ve spent all of your points in order to acquire them.
Usually, spells within a college are arranged so that the simple and less pow-
erful spells are available easily, while the more powerful spells cannot be
taken until the simpler ones have been mastered. But each spell lists only its
specific prerequisites. Each of those prerequisites may in turn have prerequi-
sites of its own. To start your character with a spell that you really want to
take, read the specific prerequisites for that spell, check each of those spells
for additional prerequisites, and then work backward through the list of pre-
requisites to find all the required spells. However, another way to do this is to
use the GURPS Magic Spell Charts available via Steve Jackson Games’ online
store at the e23 Web site (http://e23.sjgames.com), which presents a
visual chart of how the spells interrelate. This is our preference.
You don’t have to have a theme that unites the various spells that you take,
but we find that it does make a character easier to understand and hence
easier to play. It also provides a framework for how your character might
develop over time.
106
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Extending Magic with Magical Items
Magical items in GURPS are items that have magic spells forged into them. In
most cases, the item is enchanted with a spell in such a way that the wielder
of the item can cast the spell as if he knew it as a skill with the skill level of
the mage who created the item. Some magic items are useable only by mages.
The spell descriptions in GURPS Magic, pages 23–198, tell you how each spell
functions when enchanted into an item and whether the item can be used
only by a mage.
Some spells can be used to create items that give a slightly different effect
than the spell enchanted into them would give if it weren’t associated with an
item. For example, the Insignificance spell, when enchanted into an item, is
“always on,” requiring no energy to activate, but it also can’t be turned off
while the item is worn. A number of spells are specifically for enchanting
items, such as the Deflect spell, which gives a defensive bonus to enchanted
armor.
Spells enchanted into magic items can be used time and time again and do
not wear out unless the item is destroyed.
Using staves and powerstones — Useful
magical accessories
Several minor magic items can be invaluable for a mage character to own.
Whether or not they are available in your campaign depends on the GM and
campaign setting. The following two items are the most common items and
are more likely to be available than many other magical items:
 Magic staves: These are normal staves that have been enchanted with
the Staff spell. The effect of this enchantment allows your character to
cast spells through the staff as if the staff were part of him, extending his
reach with a spell. A magic staff can be up to 2 yards long, so you could
touch someone 2 yards away with it and cast a spell on them as if you
were touching them yourself. Magic staves can also carry melee spells,
giving them more reach and letting you parry more effectively while
using them.
 Powerstones: These are magic items that store mana energy, energy you
can use to cast spells. Think of it as a magic battery. Each powerstone
comes with a limit to how much energy it can store. When your mage
character draws on this energy, she removes it from the powerstone and
puts it into a spell.
107
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 

The powerstone will then begin to recharge slowly. The rate at which
powerstones recharge depends on the mana level of the area it is in,
varying from 1 point a week in a low mana area to 1 point every 6 hours
in a very high mana area. If two powerstones are within 6 feet of each
other, only the one with more capacity will recharge.
Manastones are like powerstones except they don’t recharge. Think of
them as disposable magical batteries.
Enchanting for fun and profit
Where do magic items come from? They could come from your character!
Enchanting items is an attractive ability in GURPS, but you should go into it
carefully. Enchantment takes a lot of time, and although the basics don’t cost
you an extreme number of points (especially if you’re already a mage), to be
effective at it requires you focus your character toward being an enchanter.
How enchanting is done
To enchant a magic item, at minimum your character needs to have the 
following:
 Magery 2
 One spell in each of 10 different magical colleges
 The Enchant spell at a skill level of at least 15
 The spell your character wishes to enchant into an item at a skill of 15 or
better
To enchant an item, look up the spell you are interested in using in GURPS
Magic. If it’s possible to put this spell into an item, the explanation of the item
and its energy cost will be listed at the bottom of the description.
All enchantment must be done using the ceremonial magic rules, with the
exception that it is possible to do it with no one else present. There are two
ways to enchant:
 The quick-and-dirty method: This method takes 1 hour per 100 points
of energy the item requires. At the end of the time, you must pay the
entire energy cost. This can be a lot of energy to get your hands on at
once. To reach that total, you are allowed to use your FP (and HP, too, if
you want, but you’re at –1 to skill for every HP you use), and one power-
stone. You may also use assistants who can contribute energy according
to the ceremonial magic rules, and they can each use one powerstone.
108
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Often, this isn’t going to be enough energy. In these cases, you want to
use the “slow-and-sure” method of enchantment.
 The slow-and-sure method: This method takes one “mage-day” for every
point of energy you need. For a magic item that requires 100 points of
energy, it would take 1 mage 100 days, 2 mages 50 days, 4 mages 25 days
and so on. There is no energy cost for this method; or rather, the energy
is put in so slowly that the mages are never actually required to mark
any off their sheets.
Should you be an enchanter?
The ability to enchant magic items is obviously powerful and desirable.
However, you should think about whether it’s something you want your char-
acter to get into. Because most mages aren’t going to be able to come up with
100 points of energy for even a simple magic item, enchanting usually takes a
long time, and many of the more powerful options can take a single mage
years to create. Most campaigns are going to require that the characters
spend a good bit of time adventuring, so this won’t really be much of an
option.
Nevertheless, your character can do some good things with enchantment
that don’t take a lot of time. The main one is creating powerstones by casting
the Powerstone spell on an appropriate object once for every point of energy
you want it to be able to store. If at any point you roll a critical failure with
the spell, your powerstone is destroyed. For every regular failure, your pow-
erstone gains a quirk.
The Powerstone spell costs 20 points to cast, which is a lot but not entirely
out of reach of many characters. If your character can get some people to
help him through ceremonial magic, he should have no trouble casting this
spell. Enchanting manastones is even easier; the spell requires only 5 points
of energy per casting.
Most mages can also enchant a magic staff. The Staff spell takes 30 points of
energy, which again is usually reachable through ceremonial magic.
A few easier weapon enchantments are also available. The Penetrating
Weapon spell allows your weapon to divide the DR value of the armor it
strikes; the better the divisor, the more it costs. Missiles, such as arrows or
crossbow bolts, cost only one-tenth of the normal energy cost, so you can
give them a divisor of 2 for 25 points. The Accuracy spell (which gives you a
bonus to hit with the enchanted weapon) and the Puissance spell (which
gives a weapon a bonus to damage inflicted) work similarly.
109
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 

Creating Potions with Alchemy
In our opinion, Alchemy is the single most powerful skill in GURPS. With the
Alchemy skill, you can create any of 68 different magical elixirs, many of
which have extremely powerful effects. However, as with enchanting, the
Alchemy skill is not right for everyone who can potentially use it. For some
characters, it just plain doesn’t make sense. In many campaigns, you won’t
have the time, money, or ability to be in one place for the extended period of
time that is required to run an alchemy lab. Think about your character
before you take the Alchemy skill because it will end up being something of a
character focus.
You do not have to have the Magery advantage to create these elixirs, and in
fact, having Magery doesn’t help Alchemy in any way.
Alchemy is an IQ/Very Hard skill. Each elixir on the list is considered a Hard
technique defaulting from the Alchemy skill. The default penalty is given in
the description for each elixir. For example, the Beast Speech elixir defaults
to Alchemy –1, and, if you want, you can pay off that –1 penalty with 2 points.
You cannot know how to make an elixir at a higher skill than your Alchemy
skill.
In order to make elixirs, your character needs access to some sort of lab. A
basic lab requires a lot of containers and a place to make a fire and allows
you to function at –1 to skill. To avoid that penalty, you need to spend $1,000
on lab ware. More expensive labs can give you a bonus to skill (see GURPS
Magic, page 211).
Elixirs can be made in several forms, but not all elixirs can be made in every
form:
 Potions: A potion is a liquid that must be drunk to take effect.
 Powder: In powder form, an elixir must be dissolved in drink to be 
effective.
 Pastilles: A pastille elixir is a small tablet that is burned, creating a cloud
of magic smoke 3 yards across and 8 yards high, and anyone breathing it
takes the effect.
 Ointments: Ointments are topical elixir creams that are absorbed
through the skin.
To make an elixir, you first need to gather the ingredients. This may be easy
or it may be hard, depending on the elixir in question. The cost of brewing
each elixir is given at the end of each elixir’s write-up (see GURPS Magic, page
213–219), along with the amount of time it takes to make.
110
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Elixirs are slow and costly to prepare but have some definite advantages over
spells. For the most part, their effects are much longer-lasting. They also do
not require energy to use.
Some alchemists can also make amulets, talismans, and exotic preparations
(described in GURPS Magic, pages 220–221). Because these are powerful abili-
ties that are not recommended for every alchemical campaign, they are a bit
beyond the scope of this book, but we recommend you talk to your GM about
them if you’re interested.
111
Chapter 7: So You Want to Be a Wizard — Magic 
Sample character: Magery
Bjoern’s Mage Character
The most predictable thing about me is that all
my PCs must have whatever form of Flight is
available in the game world. For this campaign,
that means that my first choice of spells will be
from the College of Movement. After that,
Healing is always in high demand, and given the
+4 Silence of Halflings, I think that the College
of Light and Darkness (and its Invisibility spell)
would be a natural choice. You can check out
the spells I decided upon in Chapter 6.
I do think that I’ll give this guy a Familiar.
Because he’s going to be airborne so much of
the time, I want a Familiar who can fly and man-
aged to talk the GM into letting me have a
Wolpertinger — a carnivorous rabbit with
wings and antlers. After looking at the rules for
Familiars on page 38 of GURPS Basic Set:
Characters, I’m able to draw up to 5 Fatigue
from my Familiar and can gain an Innate 2d
Impaling Attack (drawing upon the magical

 Grouping abilities into powers
M
ost people don’t play role playing games so that they can pretend to
be a regular person with a nine-to-five job who comes home to a mort-
gage and a yard that needs mowing. Most people prefer to play a character
who is exceptional in some way, who rises above the limitations that most of
us endure. In this chapter, we talk about how exceptional powers are
designed and used.
GURPS uses the terms ability and power to mean separate and distinct
things. An ability is an advantage that allows a character to do something that
an average person can’t, such as turn invisible or leap over tall buildings in a
single bound. All abilities are advantages, but not all advantages are abilities,
because not all advantages allow you to do exceptional things. Being wealthy
or having high status is an advantage, for example, but not really an ability
because wealth and status aren’t things you can do. On the other hand, being
able to fly is both an advantage and an ability.
A power is a group of related abilities that form a coherent whole. We talk
about them later in this chapter.
For the sake of simplicity, we start this chapter by examining the mechanics
of creating and customizing abilities before we move on to grouping them
together into powers.
Although this chapter is in the player’s section of the book, it is equally
important for GMs to read. Most systems of power are designed by the GM
for a specific campaign, and not by the players.

Understanding the Types of Abilities
The term ability is really just another word for advantage. We generally use
the term ability to denote an advantage that a character acquires as part of a
power. These abilities may be customized by the player, a process we discuss
later in this chapter.
In this chapter, we discuss a set of advantages that are primarily used to
create abilities and powers. However, keep in mind that any advantage is
available for modification and use as a specialized ability if you can think of a
way to use it, including the standard advantages discussed in Chapter 4 and
the racial advantages discussed in Chapter 10.
We find that the easiest way to design an ability is by imagining what you
want that ability to do, and then figuring out a way to manipulate an advan-
tage or group of advantages through limitations and enhancements to make
the bookkeeping work out. You will find that in practice, a particular ability
can be built in more than one way; you should select the method that is the
least convoluted, makes the most sense, and costs you the least number of
points. Check with your GM to make sure that he agrees with your assess-
ment of the situation.
Combat abilities
The following four advantages are the most common foundations for offen-
sive combat abilities:
 Innate Attack (Variable)
 Affliction (10 per level)
 Leech (from the GURPS sourcebook GURPS Powers, 25 +4 per level)
 Binding (2 per level)
Of these, Affliction, Leech, and Innate Attack are the most flexible, and you
will find that most of your attack abilities will be based on them. The uses of
these advantages are discussed in the sections that follow.
Several other abilities, although not specifically designed for combat, can
nonetheless be useful for combat. Primarily, these are
 Mind Control (50)
 Control (Variable, from GURPS Powers)
 Create (Variable, from GURPS Powers)
 Illusion (25, from GURPS Powers)
114
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Each of these can be useful in or out of a fight. All of these are discussed later
in the chapter, in the section, “Mystic manipulation abilities.”
Innate Attack (Variable)
Innate Attack is an advantage that represents an ability to deal out damage
directly, based on some destructive force such as fire, radiation, poison, or
even large heavy objects summoned into existence and launched through the
air. It is a terrific way to do a lot of damage without humongous strength.
Affliction (10 per level)
Affliction is a very general ability that can have a lot of different effects,
depending on how you design it. Specifically, it can stun a target, give it a
temporary advantage or disadvantage, temporarily lower one or more of its
attributes, cause it to lapse into a coma, incapacitate it in a number of ways,
make it drunk or otherwise distract it, negate an advantage, or even give it a
heart attack! The thing it doesn’t do is inflict hit points of damage directly; for
that, you want Innate Attack.
In its most basic form, Affliction costs 10 points a level and causes your
target to have to make an HT + 1 roll adjusted by –1 for every level of
Affliction your character has, and with a bonus of +1 for every level of point
of damage resistance (DR) the target has. Unless you’ve modified the basic
Affliction ability, its effect is to stun a target, who gets to make an HT roll
every round to recover.
The target’s specific reactions to the Affliction advantage are enhancements
to the advantage and drive the cost up. Enhancements, and how to calculate
their cost, are explained later in the chapter.
We think that an Affliction ability is worthwhile only if you’re willing to sink a
lot of points into it or if you modify it carefully. Assuming that your average
foes are going to have an HT of 10, a single level of Affliction means that they
will successfully make their rolls 50 percent of the time. Even if they fail,
they’ll recover half the time on the following turn. Because it takes your char-
acter a turn to use this ability, you are essentially trading one of your charac-
ter’s actions for a 50-percent chance of your target losing one, and a lesser
chance of him losing a couple more. And it’s worse if the targets are wearing
armor because they get a bonus to their HT roll equal to their DR. Targets
with high HT or DR are going to be very hard to affect with Affliction.
For low levels of Affliction, choosing effects with a more extended duration
can make the ability a better investment because when you do affect a target,
it makes a real difference.
Also note that Afflictions can be useful for a lot more than just combat. Some
Afflictions are beneficial, as in the case of giving advantages. With benefi-
cial Afflictions, you are likely to be directing the effect to other party members
rather than to your foes. And it is usually in the best interest of the character
115
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

being affected to allow you to succeed. If your character has an Affliction
ability that is beneficial to a target, the target may add (rather than subtract)
your character’s level of Affliction to an HT – 1 roll and will be affected by
rolling under its HT number, rather than over it.
Leech (25 for 1st level, 4 per level after that)
Leech allows your character to drain hit points from a foe and heal himself 
1 hit point per 3 drained. This can be a nice combination in a campaign in
which long combats are common. Leech is a very good choice if your charac-
ter doesn’t have a good defense or armor — its usefulness comes from being
able to heal one’s own damage while harming your enemies at the same time.
If a character is uninjured, she can still drain HP from someone, but there’s
no healing benefit; this advantage doesn’t allow you to increase your hit
points above your base.
Binding (2 per level)
The Binding advantage allows a character to immobilize a target somehow;
you determine the way this immobilization occurs when you design the abil-
ity. Your character could summon giant arms to rise out of the earth and grab
your foe, shoot spider webs, or some such thing. Binding is similar in many
ways to Affliction, at least in its unmodified form. Both stand the chance of
taking your opponent out of combat in a temporary and nonlethal way. Unlike
Affliction, unmodified Binding does not totally incapacitate foes; they can still
do things, they just can’t move. However, because resisting a Binding
requires a quick contest of ST, it can be much harder to escape than a low
level of Affliction, which just requires a modified roll against HT.
Defense abilities
Only a few defensive advantages are suitable as super-abilities, and they are
listed in the sections that follow. Damage Resistance (5 per level) can be
added to that list if you modify it in some way to make it an ability (for exam-
ple, if the resistance is due to a force field created by the character). A
number of other options are available for the creative player to increase her
character’s defensive capabilities. Advantages such as Insubstantiality (80)
and Invisibility (40) can greatly reduce the chances of getting hit.
Mind Shield (4 per level)
Mind Shield warns and protects your character from mental attacks. The
degree to which this is helpful depends entirely on the campaign — in a 
realistic, modern campaign, mental attacks just won’t be directed toward
your character.
116
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Neutralize (50)
This ability lets you neutralize powers of one source. For example, you might
be able to neutralize all psionic powers or all magic powers. You must touch
your subject to neutralize and then win a quick contest of Will.
Obscure (2 per level)
This ability allows your character to “block” one sense in order for you to
avoid detection. For example, Obscure: Vision would be something like gener-
ating a thick fog to hide you from view. Obscuring hearing might involve the
ability to generate white noise. Each level of Obscure confers a penalty of –1
to Perception rolls to be detected by the sense being obscured.
Static (30)
Static is a lot like Neutralize, but it is passive. It prevents abilities from a par-
ticular source from affecting you. In many ways, Static is more useful than
Neutralize. True, it doesn’t allow you to help your friends, but it protects you
without having to do anything. On the other hand, static only affects abilities
that are directly aimed at your person. If your character has Static (Magic),
an enemy wizard can’t burn him with a fireball, but could set the building
he’s standing in on fire.
Movement abilities
Movement-enhancing advantages can get you where you want to go faster, or
into places you couldn’t otherwise get. Clinging (20), for example, is the abil-
ity to walk up walls like an insect. It’s a bit pricey, but your character can use
it in a lot of ways.
Enhanced Move (20 per level)
Enhanced Move allows you to double your speed in any one mode of move-
ment (flying, swimming, running, tunneling through the earth . . .) that your
character can already do. You can use it only while your character is going in
a relatively straight line, so it doesn’t help you dodge.
Flight (40)
With this ability, the base assumption is that your character flies like
Superman — that is, it just happens, you don’t need special fuel or wings or
anything. You can take those modifications — fuel, wings, and so on — as 
limitations, however. Flight is an expensive ability, but it is good in many
ways. It keeps you out of reach of ground-bound folk and allows you to reach
anything, get over any wall, and so forth.
117
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

Super Climbing (3 per level)
This gives you +1 per level to climbing speed. You’ll want to take this power
only if it’s part of your character’s image or part of some special move you’ve
worked out for your character. Otherwise, you’ll probably not use it that
often in most campaigns.
Super Jump (10 per level)
Super Jump allows a character to leap long distances, with each level dou-
bling the distance he can go at a single leap. The problem with Super Jump is
that at level 4, you’re paying as much as Flight, which would let your charac-
ter do everything Super Jump does and more. If you need high levels of Super
Jump to make your character concept work, you might point this out to your
GM and see if she will give you a price break or let you use a limited form of
Flight instead.
Tunneling (30 + 5 per level)
Tunneling can be a surprisingly useful talent. Your enemies will rarely think
to guard the floors of their compounds, and many times you’ll be able to use
it to dig under all their defenses. It’s probably best in combination with some
form of enhanced sense that lets you see where you’re going, or at least with
Absolute Direction.
Walk on Air (20)
Walk on Air is like flight, only you have to do the legwork. It’s sort of a poor-
man’s Flight.
Walk on Liquid (15)
This advantage is a good visual effect but, in our opinion, is a bit overpriced.
For 5 more points, you could walk on air, which would allow you to hover an
inch above the surface of a liquid for the same general effect. This is another
advantage that will probably be most useful if you have a specific character-
based plan for it, like your character is a fairy who lives in a floating house,
or something like that.
Jumper (100)
There are two styles of Jumper; one that allows your character to travel
through time and one that allows him to jump to parallel worlds (you have to
pick one or the other for your 100 points). You should not take World Jumper
without the GM’s assurance that it will come in handy. The rules specify only
that a character can go to parallel worlds, not that any of them will contain
anything worth visiting after he gets there. The base assumption with World
Jumper is that a character can’t go anywhere he hasn’t been before (although
he can if you pay extra for the enhancement), so don’t take it at the basic level
unless you know you’ll be able to get in touch with other Jumpers.
118
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Similarly, you should also have a long and possibly philosophical discussion
with your GM before you take Time Jumper. Ask what restrictions she’ll put
on it. If your character makes a mistake, can he go back in time a few seconds
and not make it? Or is the past fixed, and when he screws up, visiting the past
means only that he’ll screw up again? What happens if he goes into the past
and kills his grandmother by mistake? If he does a Ray Bradbury and visits
the dinosaurs and steps on a butterfly, does the world change?
Warp (100)
Warp is essentially teleportation. The name was changed from the third edi-
tion because if you take it with a special limitation listed in the write-up, it
confers the ability to fly through hyperspace, which is not teleportation.
Warp is very useful and also very expensive. Even in a fairly high-point cam-
paign, it’s going to be the centerpiece of your character.
In its basic form, a character can take weight of up to his basic lift (BL) with
him when he goes, but you can take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhance-
ment to increase this. If you can afford the points, it’s good to be able to take
things or even other people with you.
Sensory abilities
Not all of these abilities involve traditional senses, but they all include the
ability to perceive in an unusual or enhanced way.
Clairsentience (50)
Clairsentience is the ability to project one’s senses so they collect informa-
tion from a point removed from one’s body. It allows a character to see
through walls and smell what her neighbor is having for breakfast. The base
advantage allows a character to project all her senses; you can limit it to just
one or two for fewer points, which is usually a good idea.
Mind Probe (20) and Mind Reading (30)
Mind Probe and Mind Reading are very similar advantages. Mind Probe
allows a character to dig information out of a target’s mind. Essentially, he
can get a truthful answer to any question (or at least what the target believes
to be truthful). Mind Reading gives him access to the target’s surface
thoughts and emotions, but not the things he isn’t thinking of at the time.
Mindlink (Variable) and Special Rapport (5)
Mindlink and Special Rapport are likewise pretty similar. Mindlink allows a
character to automatically succeed when he tries to communicate telepathi-
cally with one special other person whom you pick during character creation.
119
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

Note that you must either have the Mind Reading or Telecommunications
advantage to use Mindlink; it doesn’t allow communication by itself. Special
Rapport creates an emotional link with another person, but does not allow
the exchange of thoughts. On the plus side, you do not need Mind Reading or
Telecommunications to use Special Rapport.
Telecommunication (Variable)
Like Mindlink, Telecommunication allows communication over distances. It
can cover a number of mechanisms; for example, a character could be a tele-
pathic psychic or a robot with a built-in radio. Communication isn’t limited to
only one person, although depending on the mechanism you choose, a char-
acter may be limited only to communication with people who have a radio or
other specific device.
Scanning Sense (Variable)
The Scanning Sense advantage describes all senses that act as a built-in radar
of some sort, although they need not be based on radio waves. For example,
sonar would also be a type of scanning sense. It can be modified to have
greater or lesser range or to give more or less detailed information.
Body-shaping abilities
These advantages allow you superhuman control over your own body.
Duplication (35 per copy)
Duplication allows you to make exact copies of yourself. This can be quite a
nasty advantage in a high-points supers campaign — double your actions for
35 points!
Elastic Skin (20)
This advantage lets you alter your skin and features to mimic someone else.
We are pretty lukewarm on this advantage. Considering that it doesn’t allow
you to change size or shape or give you new clothing, its uses are somewhat
limited.
Growth (10 per level)
This ability lets you grow temporarily into a giant! Unfortunately, it doesn’t
give you the strength to go with it; you have to buy that separately, although
if the extra strength is there only when you’re big, you get a discount rate.
120
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Shapeshifting (Variable)
Shapeshifting is the ability to change into a different form. There are two 
subcategories of Shapeshifting: Alternate Form and Morph. A werewolf is the
most obvious example of an Alternate Form — your character has two possi-
ble shapes and can switch back and forth between them.
Morph allows much more flexibility — a character with Morph can in theory
take on any form, limited only by the number of points she has put in the
skill. At its basic level, Morph costs 100 points and lets your character take
any form that has a racial template less costly than the character’s own racial
template. You can pay more points into the advantage and take on more pow-
erful forms. For example, if you pay 125 points for Morph, your character can
take on any racial template that is up to 25 points more powerful than her
“normal” form.
Shrinking (5 per level)
This ability is like Growth, but it takes you in the opposite direction. It’s only
worth taking if you buy enough levels to be able to hide well, crawl under
doors, and so on.
Stretching (6 per level)
Stretching allows you to increase the Size Modifier of any of your body parts
by +1 per level. It’s left to your imagination to figure out something useful to
do with this ability.
Mystic manipulation abilities
These advantages allow you to exert supernatural control over things.
Super Luck (100)
As with regular Luck (see Chapter 3), Super Luck is directed more toward the
player than the character. Once per hour of play, Super Luck allows you to
dictate any dice roll you or the GM normally makes on behalf of your charac-
ter instead of actually rolling the dice. This is obviously an enormously valu-
able ability, but it costs a lot of points and is a strange ability to build a
character around.
Visualization (10)
Visualization gives your character a bonus to any task that he can spend some
time visualizing before he attempts. You roll against your IQ and gain at least
121
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

+1 to the action you visualized if things go how you planned. A very good use
of 10 points if your IQ is high enough that you are likely to roll well under it.
Snatcher (80)
This ability allows a character to “snatch” any item he can visualize from a
parallel world. It has to be something small that can fit in his hand, and it has
to exist or have existed at some time. A character can snatch only things that
he can visualize, so you can’t have your caveman snatcher pulling laptop
computers out of thin air.
The value of this ability varies a lot from campaign to campaign. In a futuris-
tic campaign in which all the good stuff is illegal, Snatcher can be a huge
boon. On the other hand, in a futuristic campaign in which you can buy any-
thing, all it does is save you money. In a very low-tech campaign, you might
only end up being able to pull arrows and animal pelts out of nowhere.
Telekinesis (5 per level)
Telekinesis is the ability to move things around from a distance without
touching them. It is an incredibly useful and versatile ability, especially when
you have enough levels to pick up really heavy things.
Create (Variable)
Create is an ability from GURPS Powers that allows a character to create one
type of matter or energy out of nothing. The cost depends on how specifically
defined the type of matter or energy is. For example, the ability to create any
liquid costs 40 points per level, while the ability to create infrared light only
costs 10 points per level. The level of Create you buy determines how much
of the matter or energy you can produce. Everything you create is unstable,
and must be stabilized by spending character points from a special pool. You
get the points back when you make the substance vanish.
Control (Variable)
This ability allows a character to mentally control some form of matter or
energy. It can be very specific, such as the ability to control all plaid pothold-
ers, or general, like the ability to control gravity or light. This sounds incredi-
bly powerful, but there are a number of limits. For one thing, without
modification, a character must touch the subject to establish control. Also,
Control is not a substitute for Telekinesis — a character can reshape his
target and even make it crawl along the ground, but not make it fly through
the air. And the item can’t be made to move fast enough to make a good
weapon. For example, if your character controls stone, she could shape stone
into a statue but couldn’t make the statue bash her enemies over the head;
its arm wouldn’t move fast enough to do damage.
122
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Illusion (25)
Illusion allows your character to make visual and auditory constructs in a
two-yard radius around her. You can increase or change the area of effect
through enhancements and limitations, as we discuss later in this chapter.
Mind Control (50)
This is the ability to control others with one’s mind. It can be enhanced to
allow a character to implant suggestions and make other subtle changes to
people’s minds.
Possession (100)
A character with possession can occupy other bodies with his consciousness.
To do so, the character must touch his target and win a quick contest — the
character’s IQ versus the target’s Will. This ability is as permanent as you
want it to be; you don’t have to get out of a body until you’re ready to.
Calculating an Ability
Abilities in GURPS are nearly infinitely customizable. You can get exactly
what you’re looking for by starting with a basic advantage and adjusting it
with any of a number of enhancements and limitations.
As you might expect, enhancements are adjustments to advantages that make
them more useful or powerful. For example, the basic Invisibility advantage
assumes that a character is invisible all the time. If you want to be able to
switch it off and on, that requires the Switchable enhancement. Enhancements
increase the cost of an advantage by a percentage rather than by a specific
number of points.
Limitations work in the same way as enhancements, but they give character
point discounts rather than increases. For example, if your character is a
pixie who is invisible, but not to people younger than age 5, that would be a
limitation on your character’s advantage because she wouldn’t be invisible to
everyone.
To figure out how much your ability costs, add the percentage values of your
enhancements and limitations together (making sure to treat the limitations
as negative values). If the number is negative and below –80 percent, make
it –80 percent — even a heavily limited advantage is worth something. Add
100 percent to this number to take into account the base cost of the advan-
tage, and then multiply the cost of the advantage by this percentage. This will
give you the final cost of the advantage.
123
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

If this seems confusing, think of it this way: A 10 percent enhancement
increases the cost of an advantage by 10 percent. A –20 percent limitation
reduces the cost of an advantage by 20 percent. An advantage with both the
10 percent enhancement and –20 percent limitation is at a net 10 percent
reduction. No matter what, your total limitations and enhancements can’t
give you a bigger reduction than –80 percent.
More bang — Enhancements
A lot of enhancements are available, and so to help you think about them, we
have divided them into three categories in Table 8-1.
 The first category, labeled “How It Works,” includes enhancements that
affect the basic form the ability takes. For example, a basic burning
Innate Attack allows your character to shoot bolts of flame at her target.
The Aura enhancement changes it so that she’s wreathed in fire instead.
 The second category, “How It Takes Effect,” includes enhancements that
adjust how an ability functions, but not its overall form. For example,
Affects Insubstantial allows the ability to affect ghostly or insubstantial
targets.
 The third category, “Effectiveness” includes enhancements that increase
certain aspects of your ability. For example, Accurate gives you a skill
bonus with your ability.
You will find it easiest to design a power if you progress through these cate-
gories by considering each of them independently and in this sequence.
Knowing how an ability will manifest gives you a good start in figuring out
how it will take effect, and how it will take effect (and how many points you
have left over) will give you an idea of what sort of effectiveness modifiers
you will want.
It’s important to note that the lists in Table 8-1 do not include enhancements
or limitations specific to particular advantages.

What we think of enhancements
Too many enhancements exist for us to discuss them all individually, so we
picked out our favorites. We recommend spending some time with the books
getting to know them — if nothing else, it will give you some good ideas!
In our discussions below, we do not go into great detail about the nature of
these enhancements. Refer to your GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Powers books
for those specifics. The few that we thought we should comment on specifi-
cally are as follows:
 Area Effect can be a tremendously helpful enhancement. For a 50-percent
increase in cost, you can affect a two-yard radius — if your foes are
packed tight enough, you can in theory get seven with one blow! Abilities
with this enhancement can still be especially nasty even against single
foes because your target cannot use most active defenses against them,
and if they are more than a yard from the edge of the area of effect, they
125
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

can’t even try to dive for cover! The Cone Enhancement has similar
virtues, but a different shape.
 Armor Divisor can be incredibly handy in some campaigns in which
armor levels are high, such as futuristic campaigns. It’s an inexpensive
way of getting through otherwise impenetrable armor.
 Affects Others can be quite useful, but read it carefully before you make
plans to use it. It allows an ability to apply to other people, but does not
allow them to control it. If you want to allow them to control the ability,
you must use Affliction.
 Affects Substantial (assuming you can turn insubstantial) can be so
powerful that you ought to think twice about taking it in a campaign
without a significant number of foes who will be able to affect you in
your insubstantial state. There’s not much challenge to attacking your
enemies from a state of complete invulnerability.
 Aura makes your ability surround you, rather than shoot out like a bullet.
Anyone touching you or anything striking you is affected by it. This is
very powerful in campaigns in which foes are likely to use hand-to-hand
weapons or bite and claw you. In a futuristic campaign in which everyone
has guns, it’s not so useful, at least not for combat-related abilities.
 Cosmic can be either extremely powerful or not all that useful, depend-
ing on what you apply it to. An attack that ignores DR is a big plus in a
campaign in which foes are highly armored. Mind Control that ignores
Mind Shield is useful only if there are a lot of Mind Shields about. This
enhancement is especially deadly when used with an ability that has a
lingering effect so that it can’t be countered, such as a fire that can’t be
extinguished.
 Guided and Homing are very nice enhancements, but are best when
combined with Increased Range. When applied to an Innate Attack,
Guided and Homing convert the ability to a missile that either steers
itself (Homing), or is steered by you (Guided). The speed of the missile
is equal to the 1⁄2 D range of your ability (that is, the range beyond which
the damage for your ability is halved), which for Innate Attack is a base
of 10. This isn’t very fast. If an opponent can fly, has a vehicle, or is espe-
cially speedy, your character’s missile won’t be able to catch him. If your
character is particularly fast or can fly, she might end up passing her
own missile in flight. Adding Increased Range increases the 1⁄2 D range,
and thus your missile’s speed.
 Drifting is not a very useful enhancement in our opinion unless you
have some specific special use in mind. It removes a character’s control
over where his power goes and leaves it to the vagaries of the wind or
water currents. There may be times when this enhancement means your
character’s power is blown back in his face.
 Reduced Time can be especially useful when reducing to less than one
second the time it takes to use an ability, which makes it instantaneous.
126
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

This allows a character to use the ability and do something else in the
same turn.
 Mobile is most effective when combined with Homing, so that your abil-
ity sticks with your target. Otherwise, your character is often as well off
just using the ability again as he is moving the effect of a previous use of
the ability.
 Rapid Fire is a good use of points. You can triple your potential number
of hits for +50 percent! Remember, though, that to actually hit with your
extra shots, you have to beat your attack skill by a number equal to your
Recoil statistic for every shot. For example, if your Recoil number is 1
(the base for an Innate Attack), and you have a Rate of Fire (RoF) of 3,
you get an extra potential hit for rolling 1 under skill, and another for
rolling 2 under skill. If your attack has a high recoil, a high rate of fire
won’t do much good because most of those shots will miss.
 In our opinion, only a GM who is eager for paradoxes and headaches
would allow the Time-Spanning enhancement. Did your party get into a
mess? Take Telesend with Time-Spanning and inform yourself what not
to do before you do it. Your enemy is giving you trouble? Find out where
they were a week ago and blow them away with your Time-Spanning
attack from the complete safety of the present.
 Very Rapid Fire ups the speed of the Rapid Fire enhancement, the result
being that you can’t spray shots over a wide area anymore (they all go
virtually at the same time), but you hit your one target more often than
you would with simple Rapid Fire. You can deal a lot of damage with this
enhancement.
Fewer points — Limitations
As we did with enhancements, we’ve divided the limitations up into three cat-
egories in Table 8-2.
 The first category, “How It Works,” includes limitations that affect the
basic structure of the advantage. For example, an Area Effect fire spell
with the Bombardment limitation works a lot differently than one with-
out — the limitation means fire rains from the sky.
 The second category, “How Often It Works,” covers limitations that make
it less likely that the ability will function. For example, an ability with the
Emergencies Only limitation will only function during emergencies.
 The third category, “Effectiveness,” includes limitations that reduce the
effectiveness of the ability. For example, Reduced Range limits the dis-
tance at which the ability can be used.

What we think of limitations
Again, space does not permit a thorough study of all the limitations. Some
time spent gaining knowledge of them can be worthwhile and, as with
enhancements, an exercise in stimulating the imagination.
In our discussions below, we do not go into great detail about the nature of
these limitations. Refer to your GURPS books for those specifics. The few
that we thought we should comment on specifically are as follows:
128
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

 The Accessibility limitation limits what your ability can affect. For exam-
ple, you might take Mind Reading with an Accessibility limitation so you
can only read the minds of children under 10 years of age. Accessibility
can be a very handy limitation. Be sure to not just think of this limitation
as being about what you can’t do, because often you form an ability by
thinking of what you want to be able to do and then whittling that effect
out of a much more general ability. For example, if you want your char-
acter to be able to control wolves, you could base that ability on Mind
Control with an Accessibility limitation: Wolves only.
 Takes Extra Time and Preparation Required can be a bit of a point
crock (a term we use to describe a disadvantage or limitation that gives
points without hurting you) depending on what you use it on. An ability
such as Psychometry, which will almost never be used in a hurry, is not
much diminished by taking a couple of extra seconds to use.
 Pact — receiving one’s abilities from a higher source in exchange for 
following a strict moral code — is an interesting limitation and is well
suited for whole powers as well as simple abilities. It is likely that if an
entity grants you one ability, it will grant you most of your abilities.
 Gadget Limitations (Breakable, Can Be Stolen, and Unique) can give you
a lot of points back, but you should be careful about having all your abil-
ities based on a single item. If you get a lot of points back for an item
being breakable and stealable, you’ve got to expect it to get broken or
stolen from time to time, and you don’t want your character to be totally
crippled by this loss.
 If you take the limitation Emergencies Only, make sure you get the GM
to define emergency before you finalize your character. Are all fights an
emergency, or must your character come under personal attack? Will the
emergency go away if no one takes a shot at your character for a while?
These things can have a big effect on how limiting this limitation is.
 Like Takes Extra Time and Preparation Required, Takes Recharge can
also be a point crock. Not only do some abilities not need to be used in a
hurry, many are not likely to be used repeatedly.
 Specific restricts an ability to only interacting with one type of material,
when normally it would allow you to interact with more. For example,
the limited Clinging advantage might allow you to walk up wooden sur-
faces only.
This is essentially redundant with Accessibility, and we are not sure why
both limitations were included in the rules.
 Emanation is much like Aura in that your character’s power radiates
from her. Unlike Aura, it is not a constant field, but is rather a pulse.
Despite this being a limitation, it’s not all negative. With an attack power,
it’s handy when your character is surrounded because it allows her to hit
multiple targets simultaneously, including people standing behind her.
129
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character

Combining Abilities into Powers
In GURPS terms, powers are groups of abilities that draw from the same
source and share the same focus. Usually, a character who has supernatural
abilities has them for some reason. Perhaps he’s a wizard or a priest. Perhaps
she’s a ghost or a fairy. Be it from species or from training, some background
explanation usually describes why the character has supernatural abilities.
This explanation is the source of the power.
Similarly, abilities are usually unified by focus. A focus is an integrating theme
for all the abilities, usually based on their source. A priest of the god of music
might hypnotize listeners with song, but he probably isn’t going to be able to
shoot lightning from his eyes because that has nothing to do with the theme
of music.
Not all abilities need to be part of a power. It’s perfectly possible to just have
one or more unrelated abilities that your character can use. However, you
will generally have to be able to explain to the GM how you got any particular
ability.
Examples of powers
An example makes this clearer: The superhero Fireboy has the abilities to fly,
to shoot fireballs out of his fingertips, to create smoke screens, and to extin-
guish fires with a wave of his hand. Together, all these abilities make up the
power called Fire Control. The focus of all these abilities is fire; that is, they
all have something to do with the elemental force of flame. He gets these abil-
ities from his patron, the volcano god Mal, who is therefore his source.
The psionics system detailed in GURPS Basic Set: Characters provides a good
example of power systems. There are six different psionic powers: Antipsi,
ESP, Psychic Healing, Psychokinesis, Telepathy, and Teleportation. The
source for all of these powers is the same — they come from mystical powers
of the mind. They each, however, represent a different focus. ESP, for exam-
ple, has as a focus the ability to perceive things in a supernormal way and
includes a number of abilities, such as Clairsentience, Danger Sense,
Precognition, and so on. Note that none of these powers is necessarily
psionic; any of them could, for example, also come from a religious source.
Powers are generally created for a campaign by the GM and can represent
any number of things — the special abilities of a style of martial arts, the
mystical abilities of a system of shamanic magic, or the divine gift of a pan-
theon of gods. The GM may occasionally allow players to create their own
powers — this will frequently be the case in superhero campaigns.
130
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Power modifiers
A power modifier is a character point discount or bonus that is applied to all
the abilities of a power. It is essentially just a collection of enhancements and
limitations that must be applied to all the abilities in a certain power. Tech-
nically, all powers have such a modifier, although it’s possible for it to be 
0 percent.
The reason why a power might have limitations and enhancements that affect
all of it’s constituent abilities is because all of the abilities come from the
same source and are therefore subject to the same restrictions or benefits. A
priest might gain powers due to a Pact with his deity, and therefore the Pact
limitation would be appropriate for all of his powers.
Because all abilities in a power come from a common source, it is often possi-
ble to block those powers by interfering with that source. This weakness is 
a –10 percent limitation that is part of the power modifier. For example, 
entities with Antipsi abilities or anti-psionic technology can limit or block
psionics. Because of this vulnerability, psionic abilities have a –10 percent
power modifier.
Other powers might have other limitations. For example, a Shaman might
have an assortment of abilities based on his ability to command spirits. Using
these abilities might require some sort of ritual, which increases the amount
of time it takes to activate them (Takes Extra Time limitation).
131
Chapter 8: Powering Your Character
Designing powers for GMs
When players design powers, they are gener-
ally thinking of beefing up their characters. The
situation is a lot more complex for GMs.
You’ll find that players will usually want powers
if they are available in a campaign. A psionic
character or a priest with divine abilities is 
usually more interesting to play than a totally
mundane person with a sword and skill as a
merchant. Because of this, if you offer only one
power, you may well end up with a party full of
characters who have taken it. It’s better to offer
an assortment of powers that cover a range of
different important functions. You might consider
presenting several that have useful combat abil-
ities, one that is useful for healing, one or two
that have information-gathering abilities, and 
so on.
These powers should also not just be free-float-
ing options but should be worked into the fabric
of the campaign. If a monastery full of monks
can shoot lightning from their eyes and walk on
air, how do they fit in with the rest of society?
For more on this, see Chapter 20.

Power modifiers might require the character to take disadvantages. For exam-
ple, a martial artist might have special abilities that require him to maintain a
strict mind-body connection, requiring the practitioner to be a strict vegetar-
ian and to work out two hours a day. These could be represented by the Vows
and Disciplines of Faith disadvantages. The way to show the need for a disad-
vantage in a power modifier is to convert the point cost of the disadvantage to
a percentage (for example, a –10 point Vow would be a –10 percent modifier).
132
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 
Sample character: Powers
Adam’s Supers Character
Anna Connors, a.k.a. the Anaconda, has a power
granted to her by the Snake Lord. I wanted the
abilities included in this power to have a snake-
related theme, but realized I was going to have
to be a bit loose with the definition of “snake-
related” if I was going to have more than a
couple of abilities. I originally thought of giving
her a poisonous bite, Infravision, something
related to hypnotism, and perhaps an Innate
Attack involving the summoning of a mystical
energy snake to constrict her foes. I ended up
keeping the Infravision, and I defined the hyp-
notic attack as an Affliction that gave Slave
Mentality to her enemies. I reluctantly gave up
on the poisonous bite because an attack that
can only be used in close combat is a bit less
useful, and it seems more sensible to put my
points into one more functional attack than split-
ting them into two. I decide that, rather than
summoning a constricting energy snake, she
would instead be able to summon a magic whip
made of an apparently living snake, that bites for
toxic damage and causes fear of reptiles in ser-
vants of evil gods, who are her special enemy. I
also give her the ability to summon snake 
minions to her aid. I also thought that some
damage resistance was going to be necessary
for survival in this campaign and that, because
snakes have tough, scaly hides, this wasn’t too
much of a stretch.
Her power, then, includes the following abilities:
 Infravision
 DR 8
 Innate Attack, Whip, toxic damage, causes
fear in servants of evil gods
 Affliction: Slave Mentality
 Ally group: Snakes, summonable
The next step is to assign a power modifier.
GURPS Powers gives several examples of basic
power modifiers. One of them is for Divine
powers, and this suits what I’m looking for very
well. Anaconda’s power will be granted to her
by a deity and is contingent on her leading a life
according to the precepts of her religion. In this
case, she must help the poor and dedicate her
life to hunting down servants of evil religions.
This is a –10 percent power modifier, assuming
that the precepts of an average religion amount
to a –10-point Vow, Code of Honor, or Sense 
of Duty. This power modifier gives Anaconda 
a –10 percent discount to all the abilities in the
power.

Chapter 9
Tackling Tech Level
In This Chapter
 Understanding technology levels
 Combining magic and technology
 Equipping your characters
 Inventing new technology
G
URPS uses the expression tech level, or simply TL, to summarize the
level of technological advancement for a given campaign. The tech level
of a campaign dictates everything from the types of advantages that are most
appropriate to the disadvantages and types of equipment that are available.
For example, the advantages and skills relating to computers or space travel
make sense for your character only if the technology to use them is available.
Many physical disadvantages, such as Bad Sight, become less common as
technology advances.
In the campaign description, the GM should provide a rough explanation of
the technology level as well as any particular additions or restrictions. For
instance, any technology level can be mixed with magic or powers to create a
unique world. Such supernatural abilities may be in addition to or in place of
the mainstream scientific achievements that most people think of when dis-
cussing technology. In fact, magical space travel is a subgenre of fiction and
hence of the game.
This chapter discusses the meaning of the various tech levels as well as how
they influence your character and your campaign. Included is a discussion of
purchasing, using, and inventing equipment. In addition, we give special
focus to gaming issues that are raised by more-advanced technology, such as
the effect of extremely destructive weapons on combat. Finally, the topic of
the interaction of magic and technology is introduced.

Understanding Tech Levels
The level of technology of a campaign is represented by its TL value. Our cur-
rent standard of technology is described as early TL8. A TL3 civilization is
generally considered primitive by today’s standards and a TL9 civilization is
perceived as futuristic. For most characters, TL primarily determines what
type of equipment will be available; however, the TL value is also used in cal-
culations when determining how difficult it will be to understand unknown
technology or to invent an item.
Individual characters may come from a subculture with a distinctly different
TL than the campaign setting. In such cases, the Low Tech Level (–5 per
level) disadvantage or the High Tech Level (5 per level) advantage may be
appropriate to reflect a subculture’s relative technological knowledge.
Historical settings
Most campaigns set in TLs lower than modern time are described in terms of
their corresponding historical period, such as Ancient (TL0–2), Medieval
(TL3), Age of Exploration (TL4), Elizabethan (TL4), the Renaissance (TL4–5),
Industrial Revolution (TL5), Victorian (TL5–6), the Roaring Twenties (TL6), or
World War II (TL6–7). Such descriptors are more useful because they also
convey a sense of society and culture. The only reason to convert the time-
period to a TL is to determine what equipment is available.
Alternate earth campaigns and fantasy campaigns that are set in a lower TL
may be described in terms of the corresponding period of history or simply
with a description of what technology is available. In general, the primary
distinctions are the advent of forged metal and gunpowder, the availability of
printed books, and the existence of automobiles, radio communication, and
mechanical flight.
Modern life
Campaigns set in contemporary society are identified as being TL8 (although
all three of us started gaming back in TL7). The transition to TL8 comes about
with the miniaturization of technology including laptops and cell phones.
Access to technology can be limited in all TLs, but modern society provides
an easy reference for understanding the two factors that determine who can
own what types of equipment:
134
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

 Legality Class (LC): How likely society is to restrict the availability of an
item. This value applies only to items.
 Control Rating (CR): How permissive a society is in terms of access to
such items. This value applies only to societies.
Items have an LC and societies have a CR. However, many individuals within
a given society have exceptions to the general CR. These exceptions are
reflected in the GURPS system with advantages such as Security Clearance
(Variable) and Legal Enforcement Powers (5, 10, or 15) or any other social
advantage that implies special treatment.
The other factors that control access to technology are as follows:
 Economics can determine who owns a technological item, such as a cell
phone.
 Infrastructure can determine the range of effect of the item — where
that cell phone works.
 Social values can determine common restrictions placed on the use of
the item — how and when the cell phone is used. Social values are valid
only to the extent that your character conforms to such values.
Just because an item is common and easy to get in your neighborhood does
not mean that it will be equally available in the GM’s world.
In many campaigns, the GM imposes his own restrictions which go beyond
any of these factors. If the GM says that machine guns are not available in a
TL6 environment, then machines guns aren’t available — it doesn’t matter
what “the book” says. Some GMs will let you browse the Internet to do your
equipment shopping, others require you to use materials published for
GURPS, and others may come up with their own rules.
The near future
TL9 technology is just around the corner and is being created in laboratories
as you read this. The ability to interface with computers via voice or gesture,
human genetic manipulation, nanotechnology, and cybernetics already exist
to a limited degree. In a TL9 setting, these technologies are commonplace.
When considering advantages for your character in such a setting, keep in
mind that many physical advantages can be duplicated by technology. By
investing points in starting cash, the character can acquire the necessary
equipment to have enhanced senses and reactions. The only thing to be cau-
tious about is making sure that the equipment will continue working and will
be easily available. Goggles with enhanced sight do you no good if you can’t
find them to put them on!
135
Chapter 9: Tackling Tech Level

Some TL9 campaigns take the cyberpunk path, in which the interface with
computers has become virtual reality and the distinction between the physical
and digital worlds is blurred. In such campaigns, computer skills — including
specializations such as Cryptography — are critical, and characters may
require advantages or expensive equipment to enable them to participate
fully in the digital world.
Other near-future campaigns may introduce genetic modifications (generally
implemented as racial templates; see Chapter 10) or mechanical enhancements
blended into the human form (as described in the entry for Cybernetics on
page 46 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters). At some point in the future, these
enhancements may become commonplace. As a result, the campaign may
require a higher starting point value in order to allow the purchase of such
advantages. In order to keep the flavor of the campaign, however, many of the
individuals that the party encounters will also have such enhancements. Thus,
the average individual in the world has an increased value rather than the
player characters being higher value than the norm.
Whether they come as part of a genetic template or via cybernetics, such
improvements count as advantages. Many of the advantages normally
restricted to racial templates may become available as cybernetic enhance-
ments. One special advantage worth considering is Payload (1 per level),
which lets your character have a secret compartment within her body.
All such enhanced characters (including those from a genetic template) may
have disadvantages to help offset the cost of the advantages, including such
things as a Self-Destruct (–10), Unusual Biochemistry (–5), or Maintenance
(Variable). When creating a character with such advantages, make sure that
the skills that you select provide you with activities beyond playing your
enhanced abilities.
Somewhere around TL9/TL10, characters may be built entirely as robotic
entities with human intelligence. In general, the physical attributes are calcu-
lated the same for a robot as for a cybernetically enhanced human. Their
mental prowess can be represented with Digital Mind (5) and such charac-
ters may have the Reprogrammable (–10) disadvantage. Other aspects of
being an artificial life-form can be expressed as meta-traits like Machine or AI,
as described on page 263 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters.
Space
Space campaigns require an entirely different set of skills for the character.
For instance, the distances covered by Area Knowledge become vast with
Area Knowledge (Galaxy) being a relatively common skill for many space
travelers. Survival may also require additional skills, such as Vacc Suit and
Free Fall (to maneuver in weightless conditions). Space travel can range from
slow colonization of our own solar system (TL9) to system-wide economics
(TL10) to interstellar exploration (TL11) to interstellar colonization (TL12).
136
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Starting wealth also poses a problem for both the characters and the GM.
What’s the fun of having a space campaign if the characters can’t afford to
ever get off the planet? But you probably don’t want to introduce Acme’s
Used Spaceship lot with discount deals in order to present the party with an
appropriately outfitted craft. Our recommended solution is either a party
Patron or a party with ethics that don’t preclude stealing a ship.
In a space campaign, each world can represent an entirely distinct social and
physical environment and subplot, or an entire interrelated system can be
created. The diversity of characters is dramatically greater than any other
campaign other than the most extreme fantasy realms, and unusual situa-
tions become the norm.
The vast distances between worlds offer both an opportunity and a chal-
lenge. Depending on the style of campaign, space itself may be the place for
interaction with friends and foes or it may be predominantly empty, serving
only as a transportation medium. The more that action in space, particularly
combat, will play into the campaign, the more diverse the party’s skills need
to be (particularly for piloting, navigation, and weapons).
From an equipment standpoint, most physical disadvantages become mean-
ingless, and combat no longer has a strength component. Characters gener-
ally need much higher skill levels and will be more specialized (unless the GM
elects to provide NPCs enough skills to manage the spaceship and other
equipment). One of the reasons for the high skill levels is to allow for familiar-
ization with a greater number of systems — each spaceport may have a
slightly different technology.
In addition to more skills, campaigns that allow for space travel allow for
additional advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages to consider
relating to the increased gravity experienced with many futuristic propulsion
systems are G-Experience (1 to 10) and Improved G-Tolerance (5 to 25).
Many space campaigns also introduce the option of playing nonhuman char-
acters, and advantages such as Pressure Support (5 to 15) and Vacuum
Support (5) may be available for them. In terms of balancing your points, the
disadvantages are also more useful with both G-Intolerance (–10 or –20) and
Space Sickness (–10). These are reasonably manageable disadvantages
unless your character is likely to be engaging in space combat.
Superscience
GURPS allows the reality that what can barely be imagined today may one
day be commonplace. Just as the equipment of fantasy and science fiction
of the last century has become part of our daily life, perhaps one day tech-
nology will provide transportation and other tools that seem miraculous to
us now.
137
Chapter 9: Tackling Tech Level

The three most commonly used motifs for such a campaign are 
 Instantaneous travel (including technology such as the Star Trek 
transporter)
 Artificial life-forms who are indistinguishable from humans
 Time travel
138
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 
Surviving when one hit can kill you 
One of the greatest challenges we’ve faced as
GMs is dealing with weaponry with advanced
destructive capabilities. The problem is finding
the balance between realism and risk. In gen-
eral, the offensive power of technology
advances faster than the defensive strength. In
a simpler technology, a well-equipped individ-
ual can be protected from most weapons. But
after guns are introduced, that’s no longer really
possible. And as tech levels advance, it gets
worse.
A related aspect from the character perspec-
tive is that the dividing line between non-lethal
and lethal attacks becomes much more dra-
matic. Whereas with a blade weapon, you can
always choose to pull your blow and limit your
damage, the same thing isn’t possible after
you’ve loaded your gun.
The solution? From a GM perspective, assuming
it is a priority to, in general, keep your players’
characters alive, first think about how blood-
thirsty your players want the campaign to be. At
all TLs, it is possible to craft a non-lethal cam-
paign. Restrictions on the types of weapons
allowed in society and vows or codes of honor
that restrict the characters’ actions are the two
most common approaches. But such campaigns
are not going to be satisfying if your players
want a “hack and slash” approach.
Players need to focus on making sure that they
consider defensive options as much as, if not
more than, offensive options. Carefully examine
the available defensive technology and con-
sider that it is more likely to be readily available
than weapons of a corresponding TL. Invest in
technology that makes your character harder to
detect and hit rather than just more able to
absorb damage. If magic is available, consider
having someone focus on protective spells —
they are surprisingly effective against high-tech
weapons.
Another strategy commonly used in movies, 
but usually shunned by role players, is giving 
up when your enemy has the drop on you.
Sometimes, when your foe is staring at you
down the barrel of his mark-12 death blaster, 
it’s better to surrender and get rescued by your
friends or stage a daring escape than to throw
yourself on the tender mercies of your Dodge
score.
Finally, think about what technology is available
to recover from damage. Are there technologies
that automatically start healing you if you fall
unconscious? Are drugs available that can keep
you going long enough to get the necessary
medical help? If a party member dies, is death
permanent? (It isn’t for some very high-TL and
magic campaigns.)

Of these, only time travel introduces special challenges, requiring a GM with
a very flexible and creative mind. Related to time travel is the concept of
exploring alternate earths (world-hopping), as described in GURPS Infinite
Worlds. The following advantages and disadvantages are great for time travel
campaigns:
 Chronolocation (5): This advantage lets your character know where
(more accurately, when) he is in a timestream. This is a must-have skill
for someone in any time-traveling party. 
 Temporal Inertia (15): For those campaigns in which altering the timeline
can influence the future (rather than causing a new timeline), Temporal
Inertia probably should be a requirement for all characters (or at least
those who want to remain active after the party makes a mistake). Without
this advantage, when the timeline shifts, your character may cease to
exist, and even if she does survive, she will have no awareness of the
original history. When changes result in timeline branching, Temporal
Inertia is something that at least one person in the party should have.
 Unique (–5): This is the reverse of Temporal Inertia, making you particu-
larly sensitive to changes in the timeline. It is definitely not recommended.
 Timesickness (–10): This is actually a general disadvantage that applies
to any form of instantaneous travel that violates Einsteinian physics
(including teleportation). In a campaign in which such travel is common-
place, this disadvantage can be both reasonable and fun to play.
Mixing Magic and Technology
Magic can be introduced at any TL. Traditional fantasy campaigns set prior to
the Industrial Revolution (TL5) can use the standard equipment and societies
of those periods because to a greater or lesser extent, a belief in magic was
already part of the fabric of the culture. In campaigns set in historically based
environments after the Industrial Revolution, magic is usually secretive and
limited in effect.
But many campaigns are based on imagining what would have happened had
magic been available at the start of the Industrial Revolution. Some GMs take
the path of imagining how magic could have been integrated into the devel-
opment of technology as we know it (with, say, the steam engine requiring
only a small bit of Fire magic). Others choose to envision magical and techno-
logical progress working in parallel, leading to worlds such as that of Castle
Falkenstein and Fantasy CyberPunk. After space travel is introduced, perhaps
the party members will encounter societies in which magic, rather than sci-
ence, has led the way.
139
Chapter 9: Tackling Tech Level

Technology magic
GURPS magic allows for magical control and interaction with a wide variety
of forms of technology. Not only can spells be used to affect the components
of technology (such as the metal used to build devices), but they can directly
manipulate the energy used to power such devices as well as control the
devices themselves.
The ability to convert physical energy into mana (the energy of magic), and
vice versa, opens new vistas of magical effects. A mage who can draw upon
the power of a nuclear power plant, for example, can perform amazing feats.
The problem is that such feats can quickly rage out of control, making the
mage an unstoppable and overwhelming force.
In campaigns in which computers have begun to develop artificial intelli-
gence or independent mobility, any magical abilities that permit characters
to cross the divide between the physical world and the digital realm intro-
duce new directions in a cyberpunk campaign.
Comparing magical and 
technological effects
In terms of offensive capabilities, technology is generally much more effec-
tive than magic. Hurling an explosive missile takes both time and energy for a
mage but is a simple purchase for the technologist, and the resulting techno-
logical explosion is likely to be more powerful. The one advantage that the
mage has is the flexibility in types of attack and the fact that his arsenal
refreshes as he regains energy (whereas after the technologist has thrown
her last grenade, she’s out of ammo).
From a defensive standpoint, on the other hand, magic is more powerful 
than technology until you pass TL9. The various shield spells are much more
effective than armor. Likewise, although some effects can be duplicated with
drugs, the various spells that enhance physical and mental abilities are
extremely advantageous. In particular, alchemical potions (when permitted)
beat technological drugs 100 percent of the time.
For matters of observation and detection, after you arrive at TL8, technology
again wins, except for mind-reading and such supernatural abilities as Danger
Sense or spells such as Sense Foes. Many communication spells are extremely
useful until computers reach the point at which instantaneous translation
becomes possible.

Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

In general, for mundane opponents, we go with magic before TL5 and tech-
nology after TL7 with it being a bit of a toss-up from the Industrial Revolution
(TL5) to World War II (TL7). For supernatural opponents, a healthy mix of the
two is most useful, but the magical abilities (or some occult equivalent) are
necessary as a foundation.
In general, we find that powerful magic is expensive in terms of character
points, while powerful technology is expensive in terms of wealth. Mixing the
two in the same campaign requires either creating rules that restrict both
character points and wealth, or paying particularly close attention to the
relationship of starting wealth to character points. Another interesting way to
address the interaction between magic and technology is to craft a world in
which technology works in some places and not in others, and likewise magic
is sometimes available and sometimes not. Thus, the world itself forces the
party to successfully integrate technology and magic into its solutions.
Purchasing Equipment
Often, having the attributes and skills for a task simply isn’t enough — your
character needs the equipment that makes it possible to use those skills.
Depending upon the TL of the campaign and the role you want for your char-
acter, you may find that you need additional equipment simply to function as
an adventurer, particularly in areas such as transportation and combat.
Unless your character has disadvantages that indicate otherwise (most notably,
below-average Wealth), GURPS assumes that your character has the basics of
life appropriate for a middle-class member of society. In general, that means
she has a roof over her head but doesn’t own the property; she has several
changes of clothes but nothing expensive or extremely fancy; and she has the
basic necessities of maintaining her household but probably not the items
necessary for any professional occupation. What she won’t have is any
weapons, any specialized tools, or any items of better-than-average quality.
The starting wealth for the campaign is set by the GM. Depending on your
character’s Status, you will have a fixed cost of living that is generally paid on
a monthly basis. You also have the opportunity to earn income from your job,
but if you’re always off adventuring, you may not be able to collect that pay-
check. If you can’t afford everything you think you need at the start of the
campaign, consider converting points to cash — one point is worth 10 per-
cent of the campaign’s starting wealth.
141
Chapter 9: Tackling Tech Level

Stocking up
The first things you should purchase are the weapons that your character
needs. See Chapter 11 for more information about deciding upon weaponry.
Next, focus on defense. Even if your character doesn’t have armor, you want
to make sure that he has some protection (such as a heavy jacket). 
Then identify any of your character’s skills that require equipment. Pay spe-
cial attention to skills that aren’t quite “aboveboard,” such as Lockpicking
and Disguise — items for these skills may be more difficult to acquire after
the campaign has started. The listings on pages 288–289 of GURPS Basic Set:
Characters is very useful for this. For higher TLs, several additional GURPS
titles are available, including High Tech and Ultra Tech.
Finally, consider the transportation needs of your character and of the party.
In lower TLs, most people are forced to walk, and you probably can’t afford
your own transportation (such as a horse). At higher TLs, the type of trans-
portation you start with is up to the GM (in TL8, the official rule is that you
start with a car of some sort).
Limiting what you buy
Don’t think that you have to purchase everything before the campaign
begins. Consider the type of adventure and what opportunities for acquiring
new items may present themselves. In most campaigns, shopping will be
available when your character has some cash. And he may be able to negoti-
ate an exchange of service for other items. And, depending upon your charac-
ter, he might be able to beg, borrow, or steal what he needs. Of course,
strange as it may sound, some people even like to have money left over for
future purchases.
Each TL has different requirements as to the typical items required for com-
fortable survival. The following gives you some guidelines as to the items we
believe are most important for the different tech levels and campaign types:
 Historical Reality (TL1–3): Personal basics (and someone in the party
should purchase group basics, a collection of useful items that can be
shared among the party), your weapons, a small backpack, a blanket,
candles or a lantern, a means of trapping food, a wineskin or two, trav-
eler’s rations, a pole (or staff), and rope. Depending on the type of
adventure, a crowbar and shovel may also come in handy. Most of your
money will go to your weapons; consider investing in at least one weapon
of good quality. A general-purpose knife is also a good investment.
142
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

 Historical Reality (TL4–6): Include all of the things from TL1–3 above
plus a tent and a mule or horse if you can afford it (and a saddle if you
can afford that). If you have a mule or horse, your money will be split
about equally between transportation and weapons. Depending on how
much of the campaign will occur in social settings, you may need to
invest more heavily in wardrobe.
 Modern Urban (TL7–8): A cell phone (if available) and a laptop (if your
character has the skills to use it). If you expect the adventure to take
your character into the wilderness, invest in the same items as for a
TL1–3 campaign but add a compass, a tent, and a camp stove, and
replace the candles with a flashlight. Transportation is less of a concern
because public transportation is likely to be available. Technology to
improve your character’s observation skills is very useful and readily
available. And someone in the party needs an electronic lockpick (and
the skill to use it) as well as a first aid kit or crash kit (and the skills to
use that). You character will probably want a knife in addition to any
other weapon, and a silencer can be a wise investment.
 The Near Future (TL9): Add to what you get for a Modern Urban cam-
paign and invest in items that can enhance your character’s abilities
(including drugs). Pay special attention to weapon options, looking for a
style of weapon that matches your character’s preference for close-up
versus long-distance engagements. Make sure your character has plenty
of ammo and batteries (or alternative power sources).
 CyberPunk (TL9–10): Microcomputer technology — the best you can
afford. Explore what enhancements are available both for your character
and for his equipment. In campaigns set among urban decay (a common
theme for this genre), consider more of the items recommended for
lower TLs.
 Space (TL10+): Find out from your GM whether individuals typically own
their own spacesuits and what sort of transportation is common. Look
at the various defensive technologies as well as weapons. A wider vari-
ety of beneficial drugs are available, including ones for enhancing abili-
ties and healing wounds.
 Fantasy (All Levels): Consider the items needed for a historical reality
campaign but, wherever possible, purchase the magical equivalent. If
they are available, invest heavily in potions (particularly healing ones).
Also consider investing in a magical weapon or shield. Note that many
GMs use the cost of magical items as a way of managing their availabil-
ity, so how much you can acquire may be severely restricted.
The more your character has to carry, the slower he moves, so you need to
pay attention to the weight of the objects you purchase as well as their cost.
One of the advantages of items of higher quality is that they are generally
lighter. Likewise, items of more advanced TLs are both lighter and smaller.
143
Chapter 9: Tackling Tech Level

Creating Gizmos and Gadgets
Not sure how to equip your character? Not to worry! You can rely on Gizmos
and “gadgets” to get you through the adventure.
Gizmo (5) is an advantage that lets you decide what equipment you have
available during play rather than before. Many players find it difficult to track
their equipment and to think about how equipment and skills are interre-
lated. The Gizmo advantage gives these players a mechanism whereby they
pay the points to have more flexibility on their equipment list. Such charac-
ters are given wild-card “Gizmos” that can be “identified,” or replaced with
actual items of equipment, later in the adventure. In the fourth edition,
Gizmos must be appropriate to the TL and must be available to the character
as if they had taken the time to go out and purchase them in advance. They
also have to be small enough so that they could have been plausibly carried
by the character. No character can have more than three Gizmos. After a
Gizmo has been identified during the night’s play, it cannot be changed into
something else. If the character wants to keep the item, the GM can require
payment of the cash cost of the item when the object first appears.
The Gadgeteer (25 or 50) advantage completely changes your character’s
relationship with equipment. Rather than being a consumer of technology,
she creates it. The rules already allow for any character to create a new
invention up to one tech level beyond the one with which they are familiar.
However, that is a painstaking, time-consuming, and expensive process. In
general, such inventions can only be accomplished within extremely long
campaigns. Gadgeteer, on the other hand, makes it possible to create new
items within a typical adventure or even within a single night’s play.
Gadgeteer requires quite a bit of effort on the part of the GM. In order for the
character to design any new invention, the GM must determine the inven-
tion’s relative TL and its relative complexity. Based on those numbers, the
gadgeteer can then determine how long it will take to create the device and
the estimated cost of creating it. One additional word of caution: As with
wealth, one character can supply the entire party with all they need unless
restrictions are placed on how things are shared.
The complete rules for the Gadgeteer advantage can be found in GURPS Basic
Set: Campaigns starting on page 475.
The 50-point variation on the advantage, Quick Gadgeteering, reduces penal-
ties to the point at which the character functions as a superhero — or at least
a television “MacGyver” type with a Swiss army knife and the ability to find
just the right object at just the right time and the skill to create just what is
needed in the nick of time.

any advantages and disadvantages within GURPS — such as
Discriminatory Smell and Mind Reading — are intended to be unavail-
able to normal human characters. Including these advantages and disadvan-
tages in a campaign dramatically changes the setting from realistic to some
type of alternative reality. How different that reality is from the human norm
depends on what is permitted by the GM. In GURPS Basic Set, these are
marked with two icons:
Exotic: Traits that are most likely available via modification to the human norm
(for instance, via genetic improvements) or as a racial ability. Discriminatory
Smell (15), the ability to identify and track a specific smell, is an example of
such an advantage.
Supernatural: Traits that are not part of the rational scientific world but that
may be available to anyone in certain types of campaigns. Mind Reading (30)
is an example of such a trait.
We believe that some of the otherworldly advantages discussed in Chapter 4
can be incorporated into most campaigns without dramatically changing the
environment. However, many of the advantages and disadvantages discussed
in this chapter require a campaign tailored to their inclusion (generally
focused either on fantasy, horror, or space exploration).
Although GMs may allow individual characteristics from this chapter (pos-
sibly mixed with a selection of the supernatural abilities, as described in
Chapter 8), the most common means of creating a character that strays from
the human norm is through the use of racial templates or meta-traits.

A racial template describes a specific type of creature or variant of the human
race. They frequently include advantages or disadvantages that hint of a
racial personality and may include abilities specific to that race. On the other
hand, a meta-trait describes a more general form of a creature and is usually
limited to advantages and disadvantages specific to that form. Racial tem-
plates are intended to be the basis of a character; meta-traits are more often
used to define an alternate form for an existing character — an alternate form
accessed via the Shapeshifting advantage. In some cases, a meta-trait may be
used to define characteristics of the primary form if it is based on but differs
in key ways from the human norm. In fantasy, a racial template may include
one or more meta-traits as characteristics of the creature. For example, a
vampire is a racial template but the form of body of air is a meta-trait (one
that many vampires may have). But there are no hard-and-fast rules maintain-
ing these distinctions.
Examples of racial templates and meta-traits appear in GURPS Basic Set:
Characters on page 260 and in GURPS Fantasy on page 105. Many of the third-
edition GURPS titles also contain racial templates that can be modified for
use with the current system. Feel free to use the information provided in this
chapter to create your own racial templates.
Understanding Racial Templates
On a template for a normal human character, all attributes are valued at 10,
and the character has no innate advantages, disadvantages, or special abili-
ties. A racial template provides a different starting point. Racial templates
permit a collection of attribute values, advantages, disadvantages, special
abilities, and even skills to be purchased as a complete package for a fixed
point cost. The values of the racial template then become the base for char-
acter creation.
In comparison, a meta-trait is intended to function much more as a character
modifier rather than the basis of a character. Meta-traits may adjust attribute
values, advantages, or disadvantages, but they serve as supplements to a
core character concept. Going back to an earlier example, a vampire is a type
of character; the very name relates to myth and an entire body of literature
about what it means to be a vampire. Being able to change into body of air or
even only existing as a body of air is simply one aspect of a character; it’s not
enough on its own to define a type of character.
Required advantages and disadvantages
Core to the concept of the racial template and meta-traits are the required
advantages and disadvantages. These advantages and disadvantages are
146
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

built into the cost of acquiring a racial template or meta-trait and do not
count toward any general point limitations imposed by the GM (though, of
course, the GM may modify this rule as well). Removing any of these advan-
tages or disadvantages requires your GM’s permission, and the corresponding
change in point cost does count toward any campaign disadvantage limits.
Supplementing the advantages and disadvantages with ones of your own
choosing is part of making the character your own. However, a racial tem-
plate may list advantages or disadvantages as being “taboo,” which means
you cannot add that advantage or disadvantage to the racial template. The
intent is to avoid characteristics that run counter to the concept of the race
or that are incompatible with fundamental elements of the description.
We recommend that you detail the components of any racial template or
meta-trait, listing each advantage and disadvantage separately but indicating
that the entries are part of a package. One method is to enter this information
in a different color. Another is to not include costs for these individual entries
but instead list only a cost for the package itself. Knowing what comes as
part of the package makes it easier for you to predict what others of your
kind are like (and often the GM will ensure that you encounter others of your
kind, either as allies or as foes). During character creation, also identify items
that you cannot drop from your character without GM permission (because
they are part of the package).
Think carefully about any disadvantages that you provide as part of a racial
template or meta-trait. You must provide enough so that the overall cost of
the template is reasonable. But remember that these disadvantages also must
keep with the general vision of the race and must be simple enough that most
players can successfully incorporate them into their own characters.
The physical form
Most racial templates and meta-traits describe characters that look notably
different from normal humans. The differences may be subtle (feline pupils)
or dramatic (four-legged half-humans). Be sure to consider these characteris-
tics when crafting your character description.
For many players, having a good visual image of a race is critical to being
able to successfully play a member of that race. Therefore, the more detail
you can provide, the easier it becomes to understand the vision conveyed by
the racial template.
Attributes
Variations from the normal human base attributes generally indicate a varia-
tion in size and body structure. Obvious exceptions occur, such as with vam-
pires, who are notably stronger than normal humans yet look the same.
147
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

Size modifiers
Some racial templates include variations in size that are important to note,
primarily for movement and for combat. Being of a different size is always a
mixed blessing. If your character is smaller, she’s harder to hit, but she has a
difficult time performing many common tasks. If she’s larger, she’s generally
stronger and able to do spectacular feats but also makes an easy target.
Features
Many racial templates also list characteristic features that are required as
part of your description. The cost of these is minimal (–1, 0, or 1), but they
are important to character concept (for instance, the cat people purr and
have tails).
Personality
The advantages and disadvantages of a racial template combine with the gen-
eral description to create a personality type for that race. Some aspects of a
personality may be written out as part of the description as quirks (–1) or,
less commonly, perks (1) but much of the personality comes from the interac-
tions of the disadvantages and advantages. If your view of that race or of
your specific character requires a different personality type, then you need
to supplement the racial template with advantages or disadvantages that
reflect that.
Meta-traits generally do not imply a personality type.
For both racial templates and meta-traits, considering the advantages and
disadvantages of a racial template may give you insights into personal advan-
tages or disadvantages that you will want to include.
Special abilities
Many fantasy races have magical or fantastic abilities, such as the ability to
fly or pass through rock. Alien races may have natural attacks, such as shoot-
ing bolts of energy or poisonous fumes. To represent these special abilities, a
racial template may also include advantages that are based on the abilities
discussed in Chapter 8.
Knowledge and skills
In some cases, a particular race may require specific skills in order to func-
tion. For instance, a winged race in which the typical member of the race flies
148
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

frequently should require the Flight skill at a basic level. Skills that are
required to use the advantages or special abilities of a racial template should
be included in the description. Additional skills that are critical aspects of the
personality type for that race may also be included. Meta-traits do not
include skills.
Be sure to keep the concepts of racial templates and character templates dis-
tinct. A racial template or meta-trait describes only the characteristics
shared by all members of that race. Abilities that go with a specific societal
role (such as a priest, noble, or assassin) should be part of a character tem-
plate. On a more practical level, the elements you put into a racial template
are not available for the player to adjust, whereas the ones in a character
template are. Skills and knowledge, in particular, are more appropriate for a
character template than a racial template.
Reviving the Undead
The classic undead creatures of the horror genre can also be represented as
racial templates. The most common of these are the various forms of the
vampire (from movies and print), but other undead, such as zombies and
liches, can also be created. Campaigns that allow racial templates with these
advantages and disadvantages generally also allow the otherworldly advan-
tages and disadvantages discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 (but, of course, check
with your GM).
Resistance to death
One of the standard characteristics of the undead is that they’re even harder
to permanently kill (even though you’d think that they had a head start,
being dead and all). Here are some related advantages:
 Supernatural Durability (150) lets you shake off the effects of blows,
but you still take damage.
 Unkillable (50, 100, 150) lets you ignore the fact that your character is
dying until he is at –10 × HP. The various costs of Unkillable determine
what happens when your HP reaches that level — from death to becom-
ing a skeleton to becoming a ghost. With the latter two options, you
regain hit points while in that state. Several special limitations reduce
this to a more accessible cost and to mimic the standards of the horror
genre (for example, most undead traditionally have an “Achilles’ heel,”
such as silver, which reduces the cost of the advantage by 10 percent to
50 percent, depending on how common it is).
 Extra Life (25) doesn’t prevent you from dying but does let you come
back to life after death. The details are left to you and your GM.
149
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

 Unaging (15) is a separate advantage that is most commonly used to
explain how your character looks 38 but has amassed a fortune over the
last two centuries.
On the other side of the coin, many undead have particular Vulnerability to a
substance (such as silver) or form of attack (such as magic), taking greater
damage from it. Some may even have a Dread (Variable), Revulsion (–5 to –15),
or Weakness (Variable) to a substance or symbol so that simply being in the
presence of the substance can cause fear, incapacitation, or injury.
Within campaigns that allow the undead, paying attention to the complete
rules that surround damage and injury is critical, in particular the risk to
limbs and the loss of functioning at reduced HP.
Substance dependency
Of course, what supernatural campaign would be complete without charac-
ters who require a special substance, such as blood or a magical potion, to
remain alive? Here are some related disadvantages:
 Draining (Variable): If failing to ingest the substance on a daily basis
causes damage, use the Draining disadvantage. The value is determined
by the ease of obtaining the substance.
 Dependency (Variable): This disadvantage is more flexible than
Draining and can refer to ingesting a substance, spending time in a loca-
tion, performing a ritual, or any other type of action. The value is based
on the difficulty and frequency of the required task.
 Uncontrollable Appetite (–15 SCM): This related disadvantage refers to
the craving for a substance.
You can have any combination, such as a Vampire who craves blood
(Uncontrollable Appetite), which he must have nightly or lose health at day-
break (Draining), and who must also sleep in a coffin containing dirt from his
birthplace (Dependency).
Note that many of these characteristics are also appropriate for aliens, fan-
tasy races, and modified humans. Many races have an unusual reaction to a
substance, ranging from a Dependency on an exotic mineral to a deadly reac-
tion to a common household product, such as bleach.
150
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Specialized advantages and disadvantages
The following advantages and disadvantages can help round out your undead
characters:
 Frightens Animals (–10) or Lifebane (–10): For that truly horrific charac-
ter, consider Frightens Animals or Lifebane, or even both. Animals will
run and the grass will whither as your character passes by. Strangely,
because it can be used as an attack, the corresponding ability to cause
Terror (30 + 10 per level) is an advantage. Supernatural Features
(Variable) and the more extreme negative appearances — Monstrous
(–20) and Horrific (–24) — are also quite appropriate for horror-genre
characters.
 Vampiric Bite (30 + 5 per level) is another specialized supernatural
attack and, despite the name, is not restricted to vampires. Any creature
that draws energy from its victim should take this advantage. Note that
the victim must be either helpless or willing. An added advantage is that,
when a character bites, he drains the victim’s HP and can use the points
to heal himself.
 Possession (100) is the ability to move your consciousness from one
body to another. You can either risk a contest for control of an unwilling
victim or plan ahead by taking an Ally or Dependent who is your Puppet
(5). Your character pays the cost for the Puppet advantage; the Ally or
Dependent is then unable to resist his control. All the members of a
group of Allies may be your Puppet (10) for the slightly higher cost.
 Dominance (20) or Infectious Attack (–5) represents the ability to create
others of your own race. With Dominance, you have an opportunity to
make the victim your unwilling servant if you have the points to pur-
chase him as an Ally. The Infectious Attack disadvantage is particularly
well-suited for those with lycanthropy (that is, werewolves) because it
represents the infectious nature of the illness.
Shapeshifting
Any creature that can change forms is represented with the Shapeshifting
(Variable) advantage. Though traditionally the alternate forms are animals,
the same advantage can be used to represent shifts to any other type of form,
including shifting between a normal human and a superhero or among vari-
ous races.
151
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

If your only interest is in being able to change the look of your human form,
you can accomplish most of that effectively with Disguise or with an
extremely limited form of Shapeshifting.
Note that when specifying alternative forms, you are required to identify a
“reasonably common” external influence that can cause your character to
revert to his base form (for instance, the setting of the moon or rising of the
sun for the traditional werewolf). This disadvantage is part of the core descrip-
tion of the ability and cannot be avoided. We also recommend identifying what
controls the shift away from your character’s base form, even if the trigger is
something completely internal, such as focusing his intentions on making the
change. To determine the cost of alternate forms, follow these steps.
1. Create racial templates for each of your alternate forms.
For each of your forms, you must have a racial template or set of meta-
traits. For each form, be sure to think about how you will communicate
with other party members in your alternate form. 
Include the cost of any advantages that are part of that form. Do not
include the costs for any advantages or disadvantages shared by all of
the forms; these should be added to your base form. An alternate form
does not have to be a completely different form — a human with tiger
paws is a specific alternate form. Be sure to include any required disad-
vantages or innate limitations to help keep the point costs down (for
instance, tiger paws have reduced dexterity).
2. Determine your base form and the racial template cost for it.
See Chapter 9 for information about calculating the cost of a racial tem-
plate. The cost for the normal human racial template is 0.
3. For each alternate form, record the base cost, adjusting the base cost
of each alternate form by any enhancements or limitations as
described in Chapter 8.
With no enhancements or limitations, this is 15 points.
4. For each alternate form, subtract the cost of the base form from the
cost of the alternate form.
Imagine an alternate form that costs 60 points for someone with a base
form of a normal human. 60 minus 0 gives us 60.
5. For resulting values greater than zero, multiply that value by 90 per-
cent and add it to the base cost of that form, rounding up. For any
values less than or equal to zero, the cost remains at 15 points.
60 is greater than 0, so you multiply it by 90 percent, resulting in 54.
That is added to the 15-point cost of the base form for a total cost of
69 points.
152
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Almost all of the advantages that allow for changing your form are very
expensive and would be a core characteristic of any character who acquires
them. Because of the high cost of any of these advantages, taking some sort
of limitation is generally necessary.
On the other hand, be careful to consider how long it will take you to switch
forms. The default is 10 seconds, but any switch that takes more than a few
seconds will not be useful in a surprise combat situation. Reducing the time
requires using the Reduced Time enhancement. Bringing the shift down to 3
seconds requires an increase of 40 percent in the cost, 1 second requires an
80 percent increase, and instantaneous requires doubling the cost.
The templates for many common animal forms are presented in GURPS Basic
Set: Campaigns starting on page 455.
Becoming an energy form
Shapeshifting also allows changing into nonphysical forms, such as having a
body of fire, becoming a spirit entity, or whatever else you can imagine. In
general, these types of forms are represented by meta-traits rather than by
complete racial templates. The process for determining the cost for the
Shapeshifting advantage is the same, however.
Having (nearly) unlimited forms
The Morph advantage enables you to take any form up to the point value that
you have invested in Morph (minimum of 100) plus any points that you paid
for your own racial template (zero for human normals). If you take this route,
be prepared for extensive bookkeeping — you will frequently want to modify
forms (for instance, keeping human intelligence when turning into an animal),
and thus you need to calculate the cost of each to determine whether you
can take it. One suggestion is that the Trigger (Full Moon) limitation is partic-
ularly appropriate.
Drifting Away from Human
The advantages and disadvantages in this section are most commonly used
for creating fantasy races, aliens, and genetically modified humans. Many of
them can be added to a character and still enable the character to fit into
153
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

typical society. But they can also be combined to create races that have little
or nothing in common with the normal human.
These advantages and disadvantages are really intended to be part of a racial
template so that advantages can be balanced with disadvantages. If these
advantages are allowed to only a subset of characters in a campaign, each of the
characters in the subset should be required to take the Unusual Background
(Variable) advantage to explain how they acquired their abilities.
Having a better fighting chance
A variety of advantages directly improve your character’s chances in combat,
either by providing additional attacks or by improving defenses. In general,
these are most useful in campaigns with lower tech levels because technol-
ogy can neutralize many of the attacks and provides much better defenses
(see Chapter 9).
Natural attacks
Natural attacks are particularly important for creating racial templates for
animals or for races that have an animalistic heritage. The costs of the vari-
ous advantages are generally proportional to the amount of damage that
each does. The available physical attacks are:
 Claws (Variable)
 Constriction Attack (15)
 Spines (1 or 3)
 Striker (5 to 8)
 Teeth (0 to 2)
Natural defenses
Natural armor is an innate trait that deals with any damage that passes
through your character’s armor. The most basic form of this type of advan-
tage is Damage Resistance (5 per level) and its numerous modifiers. The
modifiers allow you to reduce the cost (for instance, by having ablative
armor that wears away with use) or increase the usefulness (by bouncing the
damage back at your attacker). Unfortunately, in most campaigns, this advan-
tage is not available to normal humans. If you do take this advantage, pay
special attention to the Limited Defenses box on page 46 of GURPS Basic Set:
Characters for ways to reduce the cost. The related advantage, Resistant,
154
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

which protects against indirect attacks, is discussed in Chapter 4. Here are
the natural defenses advantages and disadvantages:
 Injury Tolerance (Variable) is an advantage that describes your charac-
ter’s invulnerability to various types of harm. This can mean anything
from your character lacking certain organs (which therefore cannot be
targeted) to your character being constructed of a fluid or swarm of
floating particles. The more extensive the resistance to harm, the more
expensive the advantage is. This doesn’t protect your character from
damage but rather determines how damage may affect your character.
 Silence (5 per level) is the ability to move without making a sound and
is invaluable to those who must sneak around for a living.
 Chameleon (5 per level), much like Silence, provides an advantage
against someone seeing you by looking in your general direction. You’re
not at all invisible, but you are harder to see. This is a very limited
advantage in practice because you need to remember to activate it and
it is inhibited by most clothing and by movement.
 Obscure (2 per level) can be used to provide more specific control over
what others fail to perceive. You can specify the sense that is being
blocked (including hypersense such as radar) and the degree to which
the sense is blocked. Be sure to consult with the GM before grouping
senses (for instance, “sound” may or may not include sonar, depending
upon the specific GM ruling).
 Slippery (2 per level) doesn’t make you any harder to find, but it cer-
tainly makes you hard to hold.
 Shadow Form (50), Invisibility (40), Insubstantiality (80), and
Permeation (Variable) are also available as modifiers of your natural
form. Each of these is extremely useful for defense and any sort of 
espionage work. Each is a separate advantage rather than being a meta-
trait, so you don’t have to have Shapeshifting in order to have these
advantages.
Permeation is the ability to pass through solid objects — be sure to con-
sider how you’ll see and breathe as you do so. 
With Shadow Form and Insubstantiality, if you lack the ability to control
your shift between forms, the cost of the advantage is significantly
reduced. Invisibility, on the other hand, is always on by default — you
have to pay extra to be able to turn if on and off.
In some cases, another option for reducing the cost is having the ability
be uncontrollable. Both of these limitations can be great fun but can also
be extremely challenging to play (both because they require good role
playing and because the GM may turn them against you).

Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

Health
Several advantages and disadvantages exist that affect your character’s health.
The three R’s of healing are Recovery (10), Regeneration (Variable), and
Regrowth (40). Recovery helps you regain consciousness; Regeneration
helps you heal damage with faster recovery of HP; and Regrowth takes care
of pesky dismemberment problems, such as having had an arm chopped off.
Extended Lifespan (2 per level) and Short Lifespan (–10 per level) only
really come into play in campaigns that stretch over an extremely long time.
However, they can be useful in creating the motivations or behaviors that
underlie a racial template. The classic alien who is extraordinarily powerful
yet still childlike can be expressed with a racial template that has Extended
Lifespan as one of its advantages.
Extending the senses
Human senses are actually able to perceive only a small portion of the infor-
mation in the environment. Modified humans, fantasy races, and aliens are
likely to have a much wider ability to see, hear, and otherwise detect informa-
tion around them.
Extending the range of your character’s vision can be done with Infravision
(10), which lets a character see into the infrared spectrum; Ultravision (10),
which lets a character see in the higher portion of the spectrum; or Hyper-
spectral Vision (25), which combines Infravision and Ultravision to enable a
character to see across all spectrums. Infravision is not the ability to see in
the dark, though some ability to detect heat is included. To actually see with
no light requires Dark Vision (25). You can also control your character’s abil-
ity to see small objects, with Microscopic Vision (5 per level), or distant
objects, with Telescopic Vision (5 per level).
Extending your character’s hearing is done with Subsonic Hearing (5), for
hearing in the low ranges, or Ultrahearing (5), for hearing in the high ranges.
The ability to communicate in those ranges is covered with the corresponding
Speech advantages — Subsonic Speech (10) and Ultrasonic Speech (10) —
which include the ability to both hear and speak in those frequencies. Be
sure to think about who you are going to communicate with using these abili-
ties. If no one else in the party can hear you, speaking outside the normal
range is not very useful. Note that if a character can only speak or hear in one
of these ranges, then the advantage has no cost — it is balanced by the disad-
vantage of not being able to communicate with normal humans.
156
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Mimicry (10) provides the same abilities as the Mimicry skill but is hard-
wired into the character. It should only be used when the ability is innate to
the race (such as with, say, a human modified with parrot DNA); normal
humans would have this as a skill rather than an advantage.
Sensitive Touch (10) enables your character to detect subtle changes in sur-
faces, such as residual heat/color or texture differences — useful for finding
hidden objects in some cases. Parabolic Hearing (4 per level) lets a charac-
ter focus his hearing to filter out noise and concentrate on a particular
sound, such as a foe’s voice.
The ability to identify people or objects via a particular sense, as well as
improving your tracking skills, are available as the Discriminatory advantage
for Hearing (15), Smell (15), and Taste (10). Note that taste and smell are
separate senses for this advantage, and taste is more useful for identifying
substances than for tracking. You must have this advantage in order to sepa-
rate the track of one individual from a group. Memorizing the characteristic
sound, smell, or taste requires concentrating at the time you encounter the
person or object, so this is one advantage that you have to think about using
before you need it.
Any of your enhanced senses, but most notably sight, can be overwhelmed
with a sudden change of intensity (for instance, walking from a darkened
room out into bright sunlight). The Protected Sense (5 per sense) advantage
is useful to minimize the time it takes for you to adjust to such changes.
Protecting a sense is particularly important when that sense has a broader
range or you have a greater dependency on it.
You can also have supernatural senses that go beyond the normal five senses
of the typical human. These include the following:
 The Detect (Variable) advantage lets a character locate a particular sub-
stance or identify a particular characteristic of a person or object (such
as a person being a magic user or an area having a strong magnetic
field). The character does not have to be able to see the object or area.
 Penetrating Vision (10 per level) lets a character see through sub-
stances and can be combined with other vision enhancements.
 See Invisible (15) is useful in any campaign in which magic spells or the
Invisibility advantage is available.
 Vibration Sense (10) lets a character locate objects around him but
does not enable him to perceive details. Note that Vibration Sense is a
passive sense; if you want to create the effect of sonar or radar, so that
your character emits a signal and detects it bouncing off the objects
near her, then you should consider Scanning Sense (Variable).
157
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

Thinking differently
Intelligence is an attribute that can be determined for any type of character.
But what about characters whose fundamental way of thinking is entirely dif-
ferent? Characters can have thought processes so fast that normal humans
seem to move in slow motion, or they can have brains that allow multitasking
as separate personalities, or even have memories from all of their ancestors.
Time sense
Being able to think and respond faster than the human norm is represented
by Enhanced Time Sense (45). Actually living at a faster rate, with the corre-
sponding ability to take more actions, is represented by Altered Time Rate
(100 per level). The reverse, Decreased Time Rate (–100), is also available,
but is very risky unless you can afford to miss every other turn of combat.
Being Nocturnal (–20) is a serious disadvantage unless everyone in the party
is willing to function only at night. With the Nocturnal disadvantage, you
cannot function during daylight hours. This is far more than a preference, but
rather a biological condition.
If the amount of sleep your character requires is significantly greater than
normal (12 hours or more), then you can take the Sleepy (Variable) disadvan-
tage. It is not true that one of the other authors has this disadvantage. Not
sleeping at all is an advantage called Doesn’t Sleep (20), and none of the authors
have that either, although we wonder whether our editors think we do.
Analytical thought
These advantages and disadvantages affect the way your character thinks:
 Compartmentalized Mind (50 per level) provides the ability to engage
in multiple distinct mental tasks simultaneously, including having sepa-
rate conversations. If possible, also purchase Extra Arms (Variable),
Extra Head (15 per head), or some combination to enable you to take
advantage of this ability.
 Racial Memory (15 or 40) provides a way of accessing information that
was known to your character’s ancestors. How this works and what is
included is up to the GM, but the higher-cost version can be quite pow-
erful and useful.
 Modular Abilities (Variable) lets you have a set of points that you can
move among different skills. Although this is an obvious advantage for
computers, other races can have the ability if a reasonable explanation
can be provided. One interesting option is to combine this with Racial
Memory, enabling you to tap into both the knowledge and skills of your
ancestors.
158
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Animal forms
The primary form of a racial template may be based on animal characteris-
tics or adapted to an environment that in the human world is the domain of
other species. In futuristic campaigns, the best explanation for some sets of
characteristics is that there is animal DNA in the mixture, whether through
evolution or manipulation.
Adapting to other environments
Races that live underwater generally have some combination of Amphibious
(10), Speak Underwater (5), and Nictitating Membrane (1 per level), which
protects their vision. Note that if a character can live only underwater, the point
value of Amphibious is zero because of the disadvantage of not being able to
survive on land. Reptilian races are likely to have Cold-Blooded (–5 or –10),
which has significant disadvantages because a cold-blooded character cannot
modify his own temperature and becomes slow-moving in cold climates.
For those who prefer to swing from the trees, the Brachiator (5) advantage is
appropriate. This is frequently balanced by the Semi-Upright (–5) disadvan-
tage. Even more extreme are those races that rarely stand upright to any
degree and are built to be Horizontal (–10).
Some races, particularly those living in neutral gravity, can develop without
any skeletal structure. In GURPS terms, they are described as Invertebrate
(–20), which dramatically limits what a character can lift (but does let him
squeeze through small spaces). Not worth it generally, in our opinion.
The dark aspects of an animal heritage
The following disadvantages are for characters who are trying to overcome
their feral natures:
 Bestial (–10 or –15) characters cannot act in a civilized manner; how-
ever, the character may become civilized over the course of play by
buying off this disadvantage. Bestial is not about being out of control or
violent, but rather about not being a member of a civilization.
 The Stress Atavism (Variable SCM) disadvantage refers to the tendency
to revert to an animal state when threatened or otherwise stressed. Note
that the animal state is not necessarily bestial; the degree of incapacita-
tion is part of the calculation to determine the value.
Looking the (alien) part
Not being human can be a good thing in an adventure, particularly because it
often includes advantages that are not available by any other means.
159
Chapter 10: Playing Races Outside the Norm

However, not looking human is frequently a disadvantage. Most notably,
having Supernatural Features (Variable) can set your character apart from
mortals who tend to have a negative reaction when they notice people who
aren’t human. More specific features are often a mix of good and bad.
Having a different number of parts
Some creatures have Extra Arms (Variable), Extra Legs (Variable), or an
Extra Head (15) or Extra Mouth (5). Extra Arms are the most useful of these,
in general (particularly when those arms can attack). Extra Head and Extra
Arms can be quite useful if you also have the Compartmentalized Mind
advantage.
Having 360° Vision (25) is a very useful advantage and does not actually
require having extra eyes.
The most dramatic disadvantage in terms of physical form is having No
Manipulators (–50), which prevents a character from using most technology
and limits her physical interactions with the environment. A less severe ver-
sion, No Fine Manipulators (–30), is also available.
No Legs (Variable) is entirely a racial template disadvantage and refers to
racial lack of the ability to traverse the ground. Your race may have other
means of locomotion (including flight) but the race lacks the ability to walk. If
your race normally can walk but your character cannot, use the Lame disad-
vantage instead.
The Hermaphromorph (5) advantage is used for racial templates in which
biological gender is under the control of the individual.
Interacting with an alien environment
Sometimes the environment around you is a dangerous place, and being able
to avoid interacting is a useful thing.
For the more complete protection, the Sealed (15) advantage separates you
from your environment but does not protect against environmental extremes
of temperature, radiation, or pressure. Filter Lungs (5) serves a similar but
more limited function, protecting you from respiratory threats, but not
threats to your overall system, such as radiation or contact poisons. Both of
these still require that your environment has what you need to breathe —
you’re just protected from any toxins in it. Breath-Holding (2 per level) and
Doesn’t Breathe (20) are ways of avoiding even that dependency.
160
Part II: Enhancing Your Character 

Futuristic campaigns in particular may introduce environments with extreme
conditions that require Temperature Tolerance (1 per level), Radiation
Tolerance (Variable), or some combination.
The need to gain nourishment from the environment is another area where
you can limit your character’s risks. The Doesn’t Eat or Drink (10) advantage
takes care of the problem completely, whereas Universal Digestion (5) just
makes it much easier to find things to eat.
Metabolism Control (5 per level) gives a character voluntary control over
his need to eat, drink, or breathe but does not remove the requirement to 
do so.
Slow Eater (–10) is primarily an entertaining disadvantage unless your GM
likes attacking your party at meals. On the other hand, Doesn’t Sleep (20)
can be extremely useful because it means the GM can never catch your char-
acter asleep.
If your environmental requirements are different from normal humans, you
may have the Increased Life Support (Variable) disadvantage. Note that 
your character’s natural environment may, in fact, be dangerous to normal
humans. In that case, the bases for advantages such as Temperature Toler-
ance and Pressure Support are adjusted to be based on what is normal 
for you.
If your character’s biochemistry is different in subtle ways that prevent her
from using human medication, then she has Unusual Biochemistry (–5).
Maintenance (Variable) and Restricted Diet (–10 to –40) are other ways of
representing similar restrictions and are discussed in Chapter 4.
GMs should allow the Unusual Biochemistry disadvantage only in campaigns
in which the ability to take human medications may be important or as part
of a racial template.
A particularly interesting interaction with environmental conditions is repre-
sented by Fragile (Variable), which describes the effects of damage to your
system. Note that this is not how things damage your character, but rather
what happens afterward — he might shatter, explode, or simply crumble 
to dust.
Having a form that is Electrical (–20) in nature makes you more vulnerable to
electrical attacks and may make it difficult for you to interact with parts of
the environment around you (such as using sensitive equipment).

Sample character: Racial templates
Bjoern’s Mage Character
Whenever I’m going to run a nonhuman, my first
step is determining what race I’m going to play.
That determines my base attributes, advan-
tages, and disadvantages and has an initial
point cost that I have to account for. After look-
ing through the list of races in GURPS Fantasy,
I decide to go with a halfling character. The
halfling racial template costs 20 points, which
includes the following modifiers:
 Attributes: ST –5, DX +1, HT +2, SM (Size
Modifier) –2, Will +2
 Advantages: Green Thumb I, Hard to Kill +4,
Silence +4
 Disadvantages:
Mundane Background,
Overweight
 Quirks: Fond of food and drink; prefers to
live underground
Unfortunately, the Mundane Background disad-
vantage prevents your average halfling from
starting a campaign knowing how to cast spells,
unless . . . I’ll have to talk to the GM, but for now,
I’ll assume that I can work around this disad-
vantage and start looking at personalizing his
attributes.

Character

In this part . . .
W
e help you with some of the toughest parts of 
actually playing your character. At this point, we
assume that your character is created and you’re ready to
begin the campaign. Combat can be a frightening and con-
fusing experience, especially if you’re new to GURPS, and
Chapter 11 helps you make sense of the process.
In Chapter 12, we help you develop a system to keep 
on top of the bookkeeping side of GURPS — taking and
recovering fatigue and hit points, accruing and spending
experience points, amassing vast amounts of wealth 
(you wish!), collecting information, and handling gaining,
losing, and using equipment. Chapter 12 also discusses
the importance of developing a character background and
keeping a character log; all these things help the entire
campaign if each player is organized and keeps his or her
character’s information up-to-date.
Finally, in Chapter 13, we guide you through the process
of learning how to role play — not only the abilities of
your character, but the personality and motivations of
this persona as well.

A
lthough it’s possible to have a GURPS campaign without any fighting at
all, for the most part, the ability to club someone over the head is a vital
social skill in GURPS games. Your success in combat starts with your invest-
ments in skills and equipment. After play begins, GURPS has a detailed combat
system that can work to your advantage, if you know the rules well enough.
This chapter outlines the basics of GURPS combat.
Chapter 15 introduces the mechanics of managing combat within an adven-
ture. Players will find the information in that chapter useful for knowing what
to expect in terms of combat sequence. Chapter 9 talks about how the tech
level of the campaign influences your weapon purchases.
Selecting Combat Skills
In GURPS, you are much better off putting your points in one or two primary
combat skills than knowing how to use a lot of weapons. This is more true in
the fourth edition than it was in third, the reason being that, in the fourth edi-
tion, you can make your character’s attacks more effective by taking penal-
ties to your skill roll. The higher the skill, the more of these penalties you can
afford to take. For example, if you’re willing to take a –9 penalty to hit, you
can target your opponent’s eye. If you’re willing to take a –6 penalty to hit,
you can make your foe defend at –3. If you have a skill level of 30, you can do
both at the same time and still have an effective 15 skill!
In a campaign with a low technology level, you probably want to concentrate
your points on a skill with a hand-to-hand weapon, and also perhaps with a
weapon that can attack over long distances (for ranged fighting) as well. You

may also want to consider a skill with a weapon for use in close combat,
because some weapons that can be used in regular hand-to-hand combat
cannot be used for close combat. If an opponent closes into your hex, you’ll
want to have a way of protecting yourself (we recommend an unarmed style
or a close weapon like a knife).
In futuristic campaigns with guns or beam weapons, you may not bother with
melee weapons at all, or have one only as a backup.
Melee weapon skills
You can choose a weapon based on a sense of style. If you think a particular
weapon is cool and fits your character’s style, that is a perfectly reasonable
reason to choose a weapon. However, if you want to pick a weapon based on
effectiveness, start by looking at your character’s Strength score.
Each weapon has a minimum Strength (ST) required to use it. Using a weapon
that requires more Strength than your character has results in a penalty of –1
per point of Strength your character lacks. You generally want to avoid this
penalty, so unless your character has a high Strength, the minimum Strength
stat will eliminate a lot of weapon choices.
After that, it’s a balancing act between damage and defense. Many weapons
allow your character both to attack and to parry (attempt to redirect an
opponent’s attack), but most of the more deadly weapons can’t do both in
the same turn. And remember that your character can’t use a shield with a
two-handed weapon either, so whether it’s a good idea to use two-handed
weapons depends on how good your character’s Dodge is.
The following are our favorite weapons, listed by the ST required to use
them. The list is organized in this way to help you ignore weapons your char-
acter isn’t strong enough to use.
One thing to watch for is weapons that are marked with a double dagger after
the ST statistic on the chart on pages 271-274 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters.
These weapons become unready after use, which means that you can attack
with them only every other turn unless you have 1.5 times the minimum
Strength needed to use them. It also means you can’t parry with them at all
unless you care to give up your attack.
Because all of these the weapons with this restriction require either a 12 or
13 ST to use, weapons marked with a double dagger force you to give up half
your attacks unless your character’s strength is at least 18. In our opinion, it’s
not really worth it to use those weapons unless your character is that strong.
Even though they usually do a lot of damage, giving up half your attacks is
too great a penalty.
166
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

This list is primarily for low-tech-level campaigns, although Force Sword does
make the list. There are only a few high-TL melee weapons listed in GURPS
Basic Set: Characters; the majority of high-TL weapons are ranged weapons.
See GURPS Basic Set: Characters for more information on these weapons.
Here are the weapons we prefer for each ST: 
 ST 3–4: Not many weapons are available for a Strength of 3. Force sword
is the best one, and in fact is the best melee weapon listed in the GURPS
Basic Set: Characters book. Unfortunately, you can use it only if the tech
level is high enough.
 ST 5: In our opinion, the smallsword is the best weapon available at ST 5
and 6. The damage is decent (Thrust + 1), and it gets the fencing parry,
which means you can use a retreat with your parry for a +3 to Parry.
 ST 6: The large knife is worth a look at this Strength level. It doesn’t do a
lot of damage, but it can be used with the Main-Gauche skill and another
weapon and give you an additional parry, which is quite handy.
 ST 7: The quarterstaff is our favorite at this Strength level. Base damage
is good (Swing + 2), although it’s crushing and therefore doesn’t get any
bonus damage. However, the staff has the best Parry of any weapon,
with a straight +2 bonus.
 ST 8: The saber becomes available at ST 8. It’s only a little bit of an
upgrade over the smallsword, and it does the same Thrust damage. It
gives you the option of a cutting attack, but you’ll usually do more
damage with the Thrust unless your character is very strong. However,
you might want to have the ability to cut for utilitarian reasons.
 ST 9: The spear is our favorite weapon at this Strength level. You can use
it one-handed with a shield and do decent damage (Thrust + 2) or use it
two-handed and do better damage (Thrust + 3). Use this weapon two-
handed, and you can attack someone two hexes away. Because the
Quarterstaff skill allows you to thrust, you might talk your GM into let-
ting you use a spear with the Staff skill, giving you good damage and the
+2 parry. The spear is worth considering at any Strength level over 9.
 ST 10: Two weapons bear mentioning at this level: The broadsword and
the pick. The broadsword is a good all-around weapon. You get to attack
and parry in the same turn, do decent damage, and still use a shield.
A pick cannot attack and parry in the same turn, but it does Swing + 1
impaling damage, which can be deadly.
 ST 11: Nothing really stands out at this Strength level, but a couple
weapons are worth mentioning. An axe does good damage (Swing + 2),
but cannot both attack and parry in the same turn. The bastard sword
(essentially a broadsword with a hilt that allows it to be used either one-
or two-handed) can match the axe’s damage if used two-handed, or do
one less if used one-handed, and can attack and parry in the same turn if
used two-handed. The glaive (a curved slashing blade on the end of a
167
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

pole) does great damage (Swing + 3 or Thrust + 3) and has good reach
(up to three hexes), but requires two hands and thus can’t be used with
a shield, and it cannot attack and parry in the same turn.
 ST 12: Two weapons deserve mention at this level: the greatsword and
the morningstar. The greatsword does Swing + 3 cutting damage and can
parry and attack in the same turn. The morningstar (a spiked ball con-
nected to a handle by a length of chain) does similar damage, although it
does crushing damage and it cannot both attack and parry in the same
turn. However, morningstars are parried at –4, and fencing weapons
cannot parry them at all.
 ST 13: Of the weapons that require ST 13, our favorite is the halberd.
As is typical for polearms, you can attack only once every other turn
with this weapon unless you have extreme Strength, so this is probably
not a good weapon unless you have a Strength of 20 or more. However,
the damage it deals is truly awesome. You can chop with the blade for
Swing + 5 cutting. If you really get tired of someone, you can hit them
with the spike at the rear of the blade for Swing + 4 impaling. If someone
gets too close, you can poke them with the spike on the end of the haft
for Thrust + 3 impaling.
The actual weapon you pick need not be based on Strength. Even if you are
going for maximum effect rather than style, different characters might have
different needs in a weapon. If your character can shoot 5d lasers from his or
her eyes, you might want to take Staff skill just for the parry. Or if your char-
acter is ambidextrous, you might choose to fight with a pick in each hand,
even if you have a high ST. Many characters are better off with a weapon that
can parry or that allows the use of a shield, even if they’re strong enough to
use a halberd.
Ranged weapon skills
The ability to damage your foes at a distance can be incredibly handy. Not
only does this allow your character to attack from the protection of cover,
but it also prevents situations in which your enemies are able to attack you
while you’re too far away to do anything to them in return.
When choosing ranged weapons, remember that you can’t parry with them,
so you don’t need to take defense into account to any great degree. If you
really like to use a shield, you might consider taking a thrown weapon rather
than something like a bow or a rifle that requires two hands. Otherwise, your
choices will be based more on damage, range, and rate of fire.
168
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

Thrown weapons
We think of thrown weapons as being in three categories: 
 Small, easily concealed weapons, such as
• Shuriken (Japanese throwing stars)
• Thrown knives
Neither of these weapons do much damage, and if you don’t plan to use
them to deliver poison, they are more of a last-ditch attempt to do
damage than a “plan A” combat skill.
 Large, dangerous weapons, such as
• Axes
• Harpoons
• Javelins
• Maces
• Spears
These weapons do good damage and leave you an arm free to carry a
shield. The drawback is that because the weapons are large, you can’t
usually carry a lot of them around. Of these, the harpoon deserves spe-
cial mention. It does a lot of damage (Thrust + 5) and is attached by a
tether, so you can retrieve it to throw again. Pulling the barbs out of
your foe causes him half the damage they inflicted going in.
 Entangling weapons, such as
• Bolas
• Cloaks
• Lariats
• Nets
Of these, the bola is the only one that does damage, and that’s a mere
Thrust – 1 crushing. But these weapons render your target temporarily
tangled. The net is the most effective of these weapons. If you hit your
foe and he fails to dodge or block, he is entangled until he can cut his
way out or make three successful DX – 4 rolls. Bolas and lariats must be
targeted at specific areas of the body, which means that for them to be
effective you have to attack at a penalty, and they cannot completely
entangle a foe.
The advantage of thrown weapons is that they often take only one hand, so
you can use them with a shield, and  you can throw them as fast as you can
169
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

draw them. (See the description of the Fast-Draw skill in the upcoming sec-
tion, “Supplementing Your Character’s Combat Skills.”) The disadvantage of
these weapons is that the range is not that good.
Muscle-powered weapons that shoot things
This is what most people think of when they think of ranged weapons. The clas-
sic example is the bow and arrow, but this category also includes the crossbow,
the atlatl (a spear thrower), the sling, and the blowpipe. Because a tool is used
to launch your weapon, its range is usually much better. The crossbow does
good damage but reloads slowly. Bows do only slightly less damage and reload
more quickly. The atlatl does great damage, especially if you have high Strength
(Swing + 1), but its ammo is large and cumbersome. The sling is a good weapon
to consider if you’re taking only a ranged weapon as a backup to your melee
weapon. The damage is pretty good (Swing crushing), you can find stones to
sling just lying around on the ground, and it doesn’t cost or weigh much.
High-tech ranged weapons
Guns make wonderfully effective weapons. So much so that they have gener-
ally consigned most other weapons to the scrap heap of history. The rate of
fire can be high, the damage large, even for weak characters, and the range
extreme. GURPS Basic Set: Characters lists a lot of different projectile guns and
ray guns; rather than go through them all, we just tell you what to look for:
 Damage: Obviously, weapons that do more damage are more potent and
wreak more destruction.
 Armor divisors: If the weapon has a number in parentheses following
the damage, this is an armor divisor. Every object within GURPS has
some degree of protection from damage — its damage resistance (DR).
With an armor divisor, your target has to divide its DR by this number
when you use the weapon. This can be more important than overall
damage in some high-tech campaigns. A gun that does 5d of damage
with an armor divisor of 5 averages 11.5 points of damage against a DR30
target, while a gun that does 10d damage with no armor divisor does an
average of 5 points against the same target.
 Rate of fire (RoF): A high rate of fire can be a tremendous boon, but
when evaluating this, make sure to think about how many shots you
actually stand a chance to hit with. Weapons that have high rates of fire
still only roll once to hit, but you stand a chance of hitting with multiple
shots. If you fire several shots, you get one extra potential hit for every
multiple of the weapon’s recoil number that you make your skill roll by.
For example, say your character has a revolver, .44M (see page 278 of
GURPS Basic Set: Characters), and a gun skill of 15. This gun has a RoF of
3, so you can take 3 shots in a turn. The recoil number is 4. To hit with
one of those three shots, you have to roll a 15 or less. If you roll an 11 or
less, you hit with two shots. You have to roll a 7 or less to hit with all
three. Clearly, you’re usually going to miss with your last shot, especially
170
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

considering range penalty that is often involved. Note that weapons with
rates of fire over 5 give you a bonus to hit, as shown on the table on
page 373 in GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns.
Unarmed combat skills
A number of non-weapon skills are useful for combat. This includes both
unarmed fighting skills and skills you use in combat but are not in themselves
direct attack forms.
Fighting without a weapon isn’t usually as effective as fighting with a weapon.
This is, after all, why weapons were invented. A martial-arts fighter, though,
can be lethal without any weapons at all. In fact, you could have an entire
martial-arts campaign without the use of any weapons at all. However, even
in a campaign in which weapons are available, an unarmed fighting skill can
make your character more versatile. We recommend having at least one of
these skills listed below if your character is focused on combat.
A dedicated unarmed fighter would probably want to take both Karate and
either Judo or Wrestling. If you don’t want your character to fight unarmed,
but prefer to hedge your bets, Brawling is probably worth a point or two.
Here are the basic unarmed combat skills:
 Brawling: Brawling is a good all-purpose unarmed skill to have. If your
character is caught without a weapon, Brawling can help in a sticky situ-
ation in a number of ways. Not only does it increase punching and kick-
ing damage (+1 per die of damage if your character’s skill is at DX + 2 or
better), but it gives two parries per turn! Unfortunately, these parries are
at –3 against all but thrusting attacks. Brawling is also the skill that char-
acters use to attack with claws, bites, horns, and so forth. Your GM might
have you roll against this skill to hit someone over the head with a stool
or use other improvised weapons. It’s a DX/Easy skill and can be a good
investment of a point if you just want to be versatile in emergencies.
 Karate: Karate is like Brawling, but better. It’s a DX/Hard skill, so it’s also
more expensive to get. It allows a character to do more damage — +1
per die of damage at a DX + 1 skill level, +2 per die at a DX + 2 skill level
or above. It also gives two parries per turn, and it doesn’t have the –3
penalty to parry non-thrusting weapons like Brawling does. Unfortunately,
you cannot base claw or bite attacks off Karate. 
If you are strong enough to roll two dice for your thrusting damage,
Karate can be an okay combat option. Because it gives you up to +2
damage per die, if you can do 2d thrusting, it makes a punch do Thrust 
+ 3 instead of the base –Thrust – 1, which is the same damage as a Spear
used two-handed! Of course, it’s crushing damage, but then Karate also
gives you another attack with your off hand.
171
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

 Judo: Like Karate, Judo gives two attacks and two parries per turn. Unlike
Karate, the attacks are throws, not punches. Throwing your opponents
doesn’t do much in the way of damage, but it stands a chance of stun-
ning them and allows you to throw one enemy into another, and that
sort of thing. Having the Judo skill also allows you to use a number of
grappling techniques.
 Wrestling: Wrestling is similar to Judo in that it’s a grappling skill.
Wrestling does not allow throws, but does allow access to the same grap-
pling techniques. In fact, it works better with grappling techniques; if a
character knows it at a skill level equal to DX + 1, he gets +1 to Strength
for making or resisting the Choke, Grapple, Neck Snap, Takedown, or Pin
techniques, and if he knows it at DX + 2, he gets a +2 ST.
 Boxing: Boxing is sort of midway between Karate and Brawling. It gives
two parries, like Karate does, and the same damage bonus to punch.
However, parries are at –3 to non-thrusting weapons, the same as
Brawling. Boxing does not teach you any kicking attacks. 
Doing Damage
Doing damage is not always as simple as rolling your dice and reading off the
numbers. Most weapons have modifiers that change how much damage you
do after your target’s armor has absorbed its allotment.
Damage modifiers
For some kinds of attacks, the amount of damage you do is modified after it
passes through your opponent’s Damage Resistance. Whether this happens
or not is determined by the weapon you have, and the modifier is listed in
the weapons chart. The basic damage modifiers are as follows: 
 Small Piercing (pi–): Weapons that do small piercing damage are rela-
tively good at getting through armor but don’t do as much damage to
the person underneath. Weapons with the small piercing damage modi-
fier inflict only half the damage that gets through armor as injury. For
example, if your foe has a DR of 4 and you roll 10 points of damage with
a small piercing weapon, 6 points would get through, but you would
halve this and inflict 3 points of injury.
 Burning (burn), Corrosion (cor), Crushing (cr) Fatigue (fat), Piercing
(pi), and Toxic (tox): All these types of damage have no modifiers. The
points that get through DR equal the injury you inflict.
172
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 Cutting (cut) and Large Piercing (pi+): Weapons that do these types
of damage multiply damage that penetrates DR by 1.5. For example,
if your foe has DR 4 and you roll 10 points of damage with a cutting
weapon, 6 points would penetrate his DR. With a 1.5 damage modifier,
you inflict 9 points of injury.
 Impaling (imp) and Huge Piercing (pi++): Weapons with these modi-
fiers inflict injury equal to twice the damage that penetrates DR. In our
example situation, with 6 points penetrating DR, an impaling weapon
would do 12 points of injury.
Blunt trauma
Sometimes you can do a bit of damage even if you don’t do enough to penetrate
DR. Flexible armor (like a leather jacket or chain mail) may keep the weapon
away from your tender hide, but a really hard blow is going to send some
painful shockwaves through anyway. For every 10 points of cutting, impaling, or
piercing damage you do, 1 point of blunt trauma damage will get through the
armor. This damage is not modified because your weapon didn’t actually pene-
trate to cut or impale. Crushing weapons are better designed to inflict crushing
damage, so 1 point of damage gets through for every 5 points inflicted.
Crippling, stunning, and knocking 
your foe down
In addition to doing straight points of damage, your blows can have sec-
ondary effects. If you target a certain part of your foe’s body, you can cripple
it if you do enough damage. Limbs (arms, legs, wings, and so on) are crippled
if they take over half the character’s hit points in a single blow. Extremities
(feet, hands, fins, and so on) are crippled if they take more than one-third of
the character’s hit points. Eyes are crippled if they take one-tenth of the char-
acter’s hit points.
Any wound that cripples a body part or takes more than half of the target’s
hit points in a single blow can stun or knock down your opponent. Such a
blow requires that the target roll against HT to avoid being knocked down
and stunned. If the wound is to the face or vitals, they roll at –5. If the wound
is to the skull or eye, they roll at –10.
If you are stunned, you can’t do anything (except defend at –4) until you
make a HT roll — this time with no penalty. You get one HT roll per turn.
173
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

Preparing Your Defense
In many ways, avoiding getting hit is more important than being able to hit
someone else. After all, the other characters in the party can always clean up
the bad guys, but you only have one skin!
There are two parts to defense in GURPS: avoiding getting hit and wearing
armor to absorb damage if you do get hit. Unfortunately, lots of sturdy armor
can get awfully heavy. This increases your encumbrance, which lowers your
Move, which lowers your Dodge. Setting up a good defense for your character
requires you to keep these factors in mind so as to achieve a good balance.
Shields
If a character wears a lot of heavy armor, a shield becomes more and more of
a good idea. If a character’s Dodge is at a penalty due to the heavy weight
she’s carrying, she’ll do well to have another active defense to use instead of
dodging. Shields provide the easiest access to a high defense score that you
can get.  Even when you’re not blocking with them, their defensive bonus will
help you with your Parry and Dodge scores.
Your character’s Block with a shield is equal to one-half his Shield skill plus 3
plus the shield’s Defense bonus. Your GM might also use the optional Damage
to Shields rule (GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns, page 484), which treats shields
as consumables, so your character may want to bring a spare or two on long
trips. For high-tech campaigns, you can get a force shield, which never wears
out as long as you have enough batteries.
Armor
Choosing armor is usually an exercise in balancing encumbrance with protec-
tion. If your character has a good Parry and Block, you may well want to go
with the heaviest armor possible. How heavy that is depends on your charac-
ter’s Strength.
A full set of the heaviest low-tech armor consists of
 A heavy steel corselet
 Heavy plate arms and legs
 A greathelm
174
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 Heavy gauntlets
 Sollerets (foot protection)
All this weighs 100 pounds for a human. Add a 25-pound large shield, and a
character with a Strength of 10 will have an impressive DR of 7 but be practi-
cally immobile, probably with a Move of 1 yard per turn.
There are several ways to deal with this problem. One is to get a horse and
stay on it most of the time. Another is to skimp in armoring some of the areas
of your body to save weight. You will get hit in the torso most often because
there is no penalty for hitting the torso. But you can save a few pounds by
getting less sturdy armor on your arms and legs.
Most characters choose to just wear light armor, which is less protective but
doesn’t make you immobile.
Active defenses
Active defenses are your character’s options for avoiding a blow. In the third
edition, there was also the possibility of passive defense — sometimes your
armor would deflect blows without you having to do anything. However, pas-
sive defense is gone in the fourth edition.
Your character has three active defenses available: 
 Dodge: Dodge is the most basic active defense, and you get an unlimited
number of dodges per turn. Your character’s Dodge is equal to her Basic
Speed rounded down, + 3. Dodge is the hardest active defense to
improve; there is no skill or equipment that can help a character dodge.
You can, however, improve your character’s Dodge by buying increased
levels of Basic Speed, the Enhanced Dodge advantage, and the Combat
Reflex advantage. You can maximize your character’s Dodge by not car-
rying much equipment, as encumbrance gives you a penalty to Dodge.
Consider putting everything you don’t need in a fight in a pack that you
can drop easily when trouble begins.
 Parry: Parry scores are based on half of your weapon or unarmed combat
skill + 3. There may be other adjustments depending on the weapon
you’re using. For example, staves parry at +2, and fencing weapons can
combine their parry with the +3 bonus you get from the retreat.
 Block: Blocks are the same as parries, but use shields. Shields get a
Defense bonus depending on how big they are, otherwise blocks are just
like parries. The Defense bonus of shields, it should be noted, adds to all
three defenses — Block, Dodge, and Parry.

Understanding Combat Flow
Because the GURPS combat system gives you a lot of different options, you
can bring a lot of strategy to bear to make your character more effective in
combat. In this section, we delve into the ins and outs of combat in GURPS.
Maneuvers
All your actions in combat are described by maneuvers. Maneuvers range
from Do Nothing to Attack, Aim, Move, and pretty much anything else you can
176
Part III: Playing with Your Character 
Working the curve
At the front of the skills section in GURPS Basic
Set: Characters, you’ll see a handy chart that
tells you what your chance of success is for any
skill level. The table at the end of this sidebar
shows you what this looks like.
One of the things you’ll notice is that there is not
a consistent change in percentage as you move
from one skill level to the next. Going from a skill
of 3 to a skill of 4 only gets you a 1.4% better
chance of success, while going from a skill of 9
to a skill of 10 improves your chance of suc-
ceeding by 12.5%. If you were to graph these
chances of success, you’d get a curve, not a
straight line.
The secret to success in combat is in working
this curve. If your opponent has a defense of 11,
and you can somehow give him a –2 penalty, his
chance of avoiding your attack will fall tremen-
dously. Similarly, if your defense is 10 and you
can get a +2 by taking a certain action, this is
going to help a lot. If your defense is already a 14,
there’s no need to worry about it, and if it’s a 5
you might as well get used to being hit.

think of. The first step in knowing what to do in combat is to understand your
options and how they affect your character.
Movement maneuvers
Being in the right place at the right time can be critical. The following maneu-
vers are how your character gets around during combat:
 Do Nothing: Not much to say about this; if you don’t have anything to
do, it’s a good option. Do Nothing doesn’t get you anywhere, but at least
you leave all your character’s defensive options open. If you are badly
wounded, taking the Do Nothing maneuver allows you to stay conscious.
 Move: This maneuver simply describes the act of moving your charac-
ter. You may move anywhere up to full Move and still retain all your
character’s defensive options.
 Change Posture: This lets your character switch among postures: stand-
ing, sitting, kneeling, crawling, lying prone, and lying face-up. The main
reason to use this maneuver in combat is if you want to hide behind
something or get up after falling down.
Attacking maneuvers and options
Attacking maneuvers are your choices for offense. They are either direct
attacks or setups for an attack. Attack options are not distinct maneuvers,
but modifications of the Attack or All-Out Attack maneuvers. In practice, it is
less confusing to think of attack options as the same as maneuvers; they both
just offer choices of things to do on your turn in combat.
 Aim: Aiming means taking a full turn to draw a bead on your target. It is
used only with ranged weapons and gives you the Accuracy bonus of
your weapon. You can gain a further +1 for bracing your firearm or
crossbow on something.
Because aiming uses up a turn, it’s only worth doing if the bonus it gives
you moves you up a significant portion of the curve mentioned above. It
is well worth aiming if it will, for example, raise your effective skill from
9 to 13. If your effective skill is already 13 or higher, it’s probably not
worth taking the time unless everything is riding on that shot.
 Evaluate: This is similar to Aim but for melee weapons. You take a turn
to evaluate your opponent, and this gives you +1 for an Attack, Feint, All-
Out Attack, or Move and Attack maneuver you take in the next turn. You
may Evaluate for up to 3 turns and the effect will be cumulative, for a
maximum bonus of +3.
Gaining a +1 bonus isn’t all that useful in most situations, but it’s still
worth keeping this maneuver in mind. If your foe is rushing toward your
character and won’t be within reach until the next turn anyway, you might
as well take the Evaluate maneuver while you wait and get your +1.
177
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

 Attack: This maneuver is the basic one for whacking your foe. In its
basic form, attacking is simply a matter of rolling against your weapon
or unarmed combat skill of choice. If you make the roll, you hit; if not,
you miss. There are, however, a couple of other options that you can
take to increase this maneuver’s effectiveness:
• Deceptive Attack: You must declare that you’re doing a Deceptive
Attack before you roll. For every 2 to hit, your foe has to defend at
1. This maneuver is a really good idea if you have a high combat
skill, and we recommend you get a high combat skill just for this
purpose. Unlike Feint, it doesn’t rely on your opponent having a
lower skill than you, and it does not cost you an attack.
• Rapid Strike: Like Deceptive Attack, Rapid Strike is an option that
can be taken with an Attack or All-Out Attack maneuver. This
maneuver lets you get an extra attack in the same turn, although
they are both at –6. This is another excellent reason to have a very
high weapon skill. If you have a weapon skill of 19 or more, you
should choose this maneuver against someone with a low-to-
medium defense level, and Deceptive Attack against someone with
a higher defense.
 Ready: This maneuver is necessary if, for some reason, you haven’t
taken Fast-Draw for the weapon you want your character to use. It is
also necessary if your character just swung a really heavy, unbalanced
weapon, such as a halberd.
 All-Out Attack: This maneuver has you swinging aggressively, with no
thought for defense! You can choose from a list of possible effects — you
can make the attack at +4 to hit, gain an extra attack, make one feint and
one attack in the same turn, or make an attack at +2 damage (or at a +1
damage per die of damage you do, if better).
The downside is that you lose your active defense until your next turn,
so all your foes can thump your character and he just has to stand there
and take it. The best reason to take this maneuver is if you’re in a posi-
tion in which you know you aren’t going to be attacked before your next
turn. Otherwise, it’s a bit suicidal.
 Move and Attack: Your character can both move and attack in the same
turn. Moving while attacking throws your aim off and gives you penal-
ties. If your character is using a ranged weapon, she shoots at –2 or
whatever the weapon’s Bulk rating is (you’ll see this on the weapons
chart in GURPS Basic Set: Characters). If she’s making a melee weapon
attack she’s at a straight –4 and your final effective skill is limited to 9.
She also cannot parry or retreat while doing a Move and Attack,
although she can still dodge or block.
This obviously isn’t the ideal maneuver to use, but it’s often better than
wasting a turn just moving. This is one of the reasons it’s good to have a
very high weapon skill.
178
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 Concentrate: This is the maneuver to take when preparing for a mental
task. You’ll most often use it when casting a spell, which is why we cate-
gorize it under attacks.
 Feint: This maneuver is a fake attack to throw your foe off-guard. To use
it, you roll a Quick Contest of melee weapon skills with your foe. If you
make your skill roll and your opponent fails, determine the amount you
made your roll by. Your opponent has to subtract this amount from his
or her next defense against you (although it must come within the next
second). On the other hand, if both of you make your skill rolls but you
make yours by a wider margin, your foe subtracts only the margin of vic-
tory from his next defense roll against you. Finally, if your foe rolls better
than you or you fail your skill roll, nothing comes of your Feint. Feint can
be learned as a Technique; see “Techniques,” later in this chapter.
Defensive maneuvers and options
The following maneuvers are choices you can take to avoid getting hit or to
increase your chances of surviving the fight:
 All-Out Defense: This is the opposite of All-Out Attack; you stand there
and think of nothing but defense. You can either gain a +2 bonus to any
one active defense, or apply two different defenses to the same attack
(for example, a dodge and a block). Of course, doing this means you
don’t get an attack. It can be a good strategy to use when two characters
are attacking a single foe who does a lot of damage; the one getting
attacked can All-Out Defend while the other character attacks.
 Wait: This maneuver is like Do Nothing, but you get to take it back if
something you specify happens before the end of the turn. For example,
you can say, “I hold the gun on him and shoot him if he moves.”
 Retreat: This is an option for modifying your active defenses. A Retreat
is taking a step backward for defensive purposes. It gives you a +3 to
your Dodge, or +1 to your Parry or Block score. With some weapons
(such as fencing weapons) you can get the +3 normally reserved only for
dodging. You can Retreat only once a turn. We suggest that you make it a
point to use this as often as you can; the +3 bonus is huge.
Techniques
Techniques are specific things that your character can do with a skill that
she’s practiced until she’s better at it than normal. Techniques don’t have to
be combat skills. However, there are some really good combat techniques to
consider.
Techniques are based on one skill or another. For example, Kicking can be
based on either Brawling –2, Judo, or Karate –2. You can then pay points to
179
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

buy off the –2 penalty and can raise your level with Kicking to as high as
Brawling or Karate. See page 229 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters for more
details on techniques.
Here are some basic combat techniques:
 Arm Lock (Judo or Wrestling): This is a great technique if you have it at
a high level. After you get hold of a foe, you do damage automatically
until you break his arm or he breaks free, and if your skill is high
enough, that won’t be anytime soon.
 Back Kick (Karate –4): This is the skill of kicking someone standing
behind you without turning around. Back Kicks are an act of despera-
tion, and if you’re lucky or plan ahead, you’ll never need this technique.
 Choke Hold (Judo –2 or Wrestling –3): This technique is useful, but not
as good as Arm Lock. It’s harder to get your foes in this position, and it’s
easier for them to fight back when you’ve got them.
 Disarming (Any unarmed or weapon skill –4): The art of taking weapons
away from people. It’s good if you want to capture someone, or if some-
one has a weapon of terrifying effectiveness you’d rather they quit using
on you.
 Dual-Weapon Attack (Any one-handed melee weapon –4): Normally, you
are at –4 to attack with a weapon in each hand in the same turn. This
technique allows you to pay that penalty off. It is absolutely worthwhile
for anyone who is a dedicated fighter. Combined with Off-Hand Weapon
Training or Ambidexterity, it gives you another attack each turn with no
penalty. It is, however, listed as not being realistic, so check with the GM
to see if she allows it.
 Elbow Strike (Brawling –2 or Karate –2): Points in this technique allow
you to strike with the elbow without the usual penalty. The only real
benefit to this is that it allows you to injure someone grappling you from
behind, say with a Choke Hold technique.
 Feint (Any unarmed or melee weapon skill): The details of this maneu-
ver are listed in the section on offensive maneuvers earlier in this 
chapter. Taking it as a technique, however, allows you to get better 
at it.
Feint is a great maneuver against a foe with a good defense but a lower
weapon skill level than your own. If his skill is higher than yours, it’s not
as good of an option because he’s usually going to win the Quick Contest
and you’ll just end up wasting attacks. It works well in combination with
hitting a vital spot on your enemy because it doesn’t cost you a to-hit
penalty like Deceptive Attack does.
180
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 Finger Lock (Arm Lock –3): This maneuver is like Arm Lock, only you twist
fingers. The only advantage is that it’s easier to cripple a hand than an arm.
 Ground Fighting (Any unarmed or melee weapon skill –4): This is the
art of fighting while lying on the ground. This is another “preparing for
the worst” technique; hopefully your character will do most of his fight-
ing on his feet.
 Horse Archery (Bow –4): You definitely want to take this if you plan to
shoot a bow from horseback.
 Jump Kick (Karate –4): Jump Kick lets you put a kick at the end of a
jump. You do +2 damage, and your opponents parry at –2! Unfortunately,
you have –2 on all of your defenses for the rest of the turn.
 Kicking (Brawling –2 or Karate –2): Normally, kicking is at –2 to these
skills; this allows you to buy that off. A good idea if Karate or Brawling is
your regular fighting skill.
 Knee Strike (Brawling –1 or Karate –1): Essentially, a Knee Strike is a
kick you can do in close combat.
 Neck Snap (ST –4): This is a nasty close-combat attack for those strong
enough to win Contests of Strength with their enemies. You can buy this
ability up to ST +3, so if your character spends a lot of time in unarmed
close combat, consider taking this technique.
 Off-Hand Weapon Training (melee weapon – 4): Normally, a character is
at –4 to attack with her off hand, and this buys that penalty off. However,
you’re still stuck with the –4 for attacking with two weapons in one turn,
so if you don’t have a Duel Weapon Attack or a very high weapon skill,
it’s not as useful.
 Retain Weapon (any melee weapon): This is the technique of resisting
the Disarming technique. You can probably wait and see if your GM uses
Disarming against you a lot, and if not, keep the points you would have
put in this.
 Sweep (Polearm –3, Spear –3, or Staff –3): This is the technique of knock-
ing your opponent’s legs out from under him — a handy technique
against foes with DR too high for you to penetrate or to keep a nasty
fighter from hitting you for a turn or two as he gets up.
 Whirlwind Attack (Broadsword –5, Staff –5, or Two-Handed Sword –5):
This technique lets you attack every foe in an adjacent hex all in one
turn. It is an All-Out Attack, so you get no defense when using this. This
seems like a really neat technique, but in practice it’s not as useful as
you might suppose. It can give you a very large number of attacks, but if
your character doesn’t put all his enemies out of commission, he winds
up standing in a large hostile crowd without any defenses available.
181
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

Supplementing Your Character’s 
Combat Skills
The following supplemental skills enhance your fighting ability but are not
weapons skills. Taking a few of these increases your character’s chances of
success in combat and perhaps makes your character more flexible.
 The Cloak skill is the skill of using a cloak as a weapon. You can use it to
throw over an opponent’s head and grapple him, or to wrap around your
arm as a shield, or to block your opponent’s vision (treat as a Feint). It’s a
cool skill, but a cloak is not exceptionally useful as a weapon.
It is, however, quite useful as a shield, especially if your GM is not using
the optional Damage to Shields rule. (See GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns,
page 484.) A light cloak gives you a +1 bonus to your active defenses,
and a heavy cloak gives you +2. At 5 pounds, this makes a heavy cloak as
good as a 15-pound medium shield! However, if your GM is using the
Damage to Shields rule, at DR 1 and 5 hit points, the cloak’s going to last
for only a blow or two.
The other advantage of this skill is that you can take a cloak to places
where you would draw attention if you were carrying a shield.
Otherwise, being able to grapple someone at a range of 1 isn’t something
you’re going to want to do every day, and while feinting is a good tech-
nique, you’re better off just taking your primary weapon to a high skill
level and feinting with that.
 Throwing is the general skill of throwing anything that fits easily into
your character’s hand and that doesn’t have a point you need to hit 
with — a baseball, a rock, a jar of holy water, and so on. We’re listing it
as a combat skill only because, from time to time, you’ll find your char-
acter needing to throw something in combat for a special effect. It is not
a frontline combat skill but makes your character more versatile.
 Acrobatics is not primarily a combat skill, but having it allows you to
attempt an Acrobatic Dodge. If you make an Acrobatics roll before
making your Dodge roll, your Dodge is at +2 (it is, however, at –2 if you
fail). This is very handy, and the skill is well worth a point or two.
 The Tactics skill allows you to prepare for combat beforehand to give
you an advantage. If you have time to prepare before combat, a success-
ful Tactics roll allows you to put your character someplace that will give
him or her strategic advantage. Otherwise, your character is just randomly
placed. This is a useful skill if your GM actually uses these rules, although
in our experience, most GMs place a character where the player said she
was going rather than randomly, and this makes the skill less relevant.
182
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 The Strategy skill is similar to Tactics but is used in large-scale military
actions. A successful roll (or Contest of skill, if the enemy leader has this
skill, too) lets you deduce your opponent’s plans. This skill is vital if you
are planning to lead troops; otherwise, you’ll never use it.
 The Fast-Draw skill allows you to pull your weapon out and use it in the
same turn, rather than taking the whole turn to Ready your weapon. You
must buy Fast-Draw separately for each type of weapon you have. It is
foolish to not buy this skill for at least your primary weapon. It is a
DX/Easy skill, so usually you only need to put a point or maybe two into
it, and it can save you a turn in emergencies. Almost equally useful, it
allows you to go into precarious situations without having to provoke
your potential foes by having your weapon drawn. For archers, Fast-
Draw Arrow shaves a turn off your rate of fire. It’s really too useful of a
skill not to invest a point in.
Cinematic Martial Arts
If you want to play a martial-arts action hero straight from the movies, you’ll
be interested in two GURPS advantages: Trained By A Master and Weapon
Master. These two are the basis of a character with supernatural skill with
weapons.
Trained By A Master
Having the Trained By A Master advantage means that your character
learned the hidden secrets of combat. It is helpful both with weapon fighting
and with unarmed combat. It halves the usual penalty for the Rapid Strike
option and for parrying more than once per turn. It also permits you to buy
some of the cinematic martial-arts skills, such as
183
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat
 Blind Fighting
 Breaking Blow
 Flying Leap
 Immovable Stance
 Invisibility Art
 Kiai
 Light Walk
 Mental Strength
 Power Blow
 Pressure Points
 Pressure Secrets
 Push
 Throwing Art
 Zen Archery

Third-edition GURPS included a sourcebook for martial arts. If you wanted to
learn a martial art, you had to pick a style and learn the skills and techniques
for that style. As of December 2005, the fourth edition of GURPS Martial Arts
was being developed for release in late 2006; until then, your GM may want to
institute something similar.
Weapon Master
This advantage gives your character special aptitude with a category of
weapons. This category can range from all muscle-powered weapons to only
a specific weapon.
Weapon Master gives you the same penalty reduction as Trained By A Master
for Rapid Striking and parrying more than once a turn. It also gives you a
bonus to your damage:  +1 per die of damage if you know your weapon at a
skill level of DX + 1, +2 per die of damage if you know it at DX + 2.
Also, like Trained By A Master, Weapon Master gives you some access to the
cinematic martial-arts skills, although not as many of them. They have to be
something you can use with your weapon, so things like Light Walk and
Invisibility Art aren’t available.
For the most part, you get your best value with this advantage if you take it
either for one weapon or for two weapons normally used together. In most
campaigns, you aren’t going to be running around picking up random
weapons and using them. It’s best if you stick with one or two weapons skills
to put your points in, so why pay extra for an advantage that gives you a
bonus to weapons you scarcely know how to use?
Overcoming Common Combat Problems
Fights in GURPS are like snowflakes; no two of them are the same. Each combat
situation presents you with different situations to overcome. Nevertheless,
there are some general categories of combat problems to think about.
My foe has a very high defense! None of
my blows are getting through!
In situations like this, you either have to lower your foe’s defense, or some-
how get around it altogether. Deceptive Attack is a great option in these situa-
tions. If your foe has one terrific defense and then a so-so one — for example
a very high Parry score and an average Dodge — you could also use multiple
184
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

attacks (like Rapid Strike or Dual-Weapon Attack). Make your foe use her
good parry on the first defense, and then hope she fails her dodge on the
second.
Along these same lines, arranging to have multiple members of your party
attack single opponents is a great idea. Again, this gets through the usually
higher initial defenses (parries and blocks) and into dodges, which are usu-
ally lower.
Feints can also be useful in this situation, although you really need to have a
higher weapon skill than your foe for it to work well.
If you are really having trouble, and you have a buddy to help you out, one of
you can engage in close combat with your foe. In order for this to be effective,
you’ll have to grapple with the foe or perhaps knock him down. This will pre-
vent him from turning around, so your friend can attack him from behind,
prevent him from using the Retreat option, or make him take defensive penalties
for being on the ground.  Most reasonable GMs assess a defensive penalty for
someone being grappled.
If you have several buddies to help you, you should spread out so one of you
can attack from behind or at least from the side. Your foe does not get an active
defense from blows from behind and is at –2 to defend blows from the sides.
My foes are individually weak, 
but there are a lot of them!
Be very careful when your character is outnumbered. Surprisingly weak ene-
mies can wipe you out if there are several of them. The big problem is that a
lot of enemies take a lot of blows, and after you use up your parries and
blocks, you’re stuck with dodging. Also, a horde of enemies can surround
your character and hit her from behind so that she can’t defend at all.
Because of this, your primary goal is going to be not getting surrounded.
Don’t rush a large group. If you have a missile weapon, try and pick off some
of them as they come. Move your character laterally as they advance, so that
you put as much of the group behind a lead figure as possible. If you have
room, back up as they arrive, so that they can’t circle behind you. You aren’t
so much trying to get away from them as you are trying to get them to string
out in a line so they arrive in ones and twos. Also use any available obstacles
to funnel your foes into a single file.
Putting your back up against a wall or other obstacle is okay in a pinch, but
you’re better off retreating and attacking if you have the room to do it. If your
character gets up against something, he’ll have to stay there for the duration.
185
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

If you’re fighting as part of a group, stick together so it’s harder to all be sur-
rounded. It’s good to pick a few individuals within the larger group of foes to
gang up on and put down as quickly as possible. Reducing their numbers is the
name of the game, and unless you’re sure you can wipe an opponent out in one
blow, it’s better to finish off one foe than spread damage among a lot of foes.
My foe has a powerful attack 
that I cannot withstand!
If your character is fighting someone who deals out so much damage that
you’ll probably be wiped out if you get hit, your main goals are not getting hit
and taking the foe down in a hurry.
The simplest way to deal with such a foe is to try to use distance weapons
and stay out of range, if possible.
As far as not getting hit goes, be sure to use the retreat option to get +3 on
your Dodge and on your Parry if using a fencing weapon, Boxing, Judo, or
Karate, and +1 on your Block or any other Parry. Also consider using an
Acrobatic Dodge, if you have the Acrobatics skill, or a Feverish Defense (see
GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns, page 357).
Consider going into close combat with your enemy if his or her weapon isn’t
useful in close combat and you have some sort of option. If you have a friend
to help you out, consider having the weakest fighter get into close combat
and grapple your foe’s weapon arm just to take away the use of the nasty
weapon. If the nasty weapon is useful in close combat, try to have whoever is
getting attacked that turn take an All-Out Defense maneuver while the other
characters attack.
To take the opponent out quickly, think about targeting his weapon arm,
hand, stinger-tipped tail, or whatever body part would put his weapon out of
combat. If your foe also has a good defense, this is probably the best time to
break out the Feint technique. Although it costs you an attack, the Feint
allows you to give your foe a defense penalty without inflicting an attack
penalty on yourself, which makes it easier to take the hit location penalties
and still have a good chance of success.
Putting your foe in an Arm Lock can be helpful, too, because a twisted arm
can’t swing a weapon. The Disarming technique can also be a huge boon here.
186
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

I can hit my foe just fine, but I 
can’t get through her armor!
This is a tough one. The first thing to look for is weaknesses in the armor that
your character can aim for (See GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns, page 400). If
your foe is an armored knight, you might think about targeting his feet. The
best foot armor is only DR4.
If there are no such chinks or weak spots, then you should probably start
thinking in terms of things your character can do that are useful but that
don’t necessarily inflict direct damage. If you have enough people, you can
probably knock your foe over and tie her up or something like that.
If the strongest fighters in the party are able to damage your foe, you should
let them do the damaging attacks and stick to hindering moves, such as trip-
ping your foe or throwing your cloak over her face. Attacking her weapon
gives you a chance of disarming her.
The Arm Lock technique can be quite helpful here if your foe has flexible
armor because Arm Lock ignores such defenses. If you have a staff, spear, or
polearm, you might also try the Sweep technique to knock down a foe and
keep her from attacking for a turn or two.
You can also consider using the All-Out Attack maneuver to increase your
damage, although it is generally not worth it to give your defense a +2 to
damage unless your foe’s attention is focused somewhere else. You can also
spend 1 point of fatigue to get +2 damage if your GM allows the optional
Extra Effort rules found in GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns, page 357.
How do I use my character’s healing
magic to best advantage?
One way of looking at combat is that both sides have a certain number of
total hit points, and the first side to reduce its opponent’s total to 0 wins.
Therefore, you can help your side either by damaging your opponents or by
removing damage from your friends.
In practice, healing should usually be done in moderation during actual
combat unless it can be done quickly enough so that it doesn’t cost your
party many attacks. If you have a mage with a high enough skill to heal at a
187
Chapter 11: Doing Unto Others: Combat

distance, then such healing is fine; but if you need to have fighters leaving
combat to go to a healer, it can cost your side a lot of offensive resources.
The main goal of a healer during combat is to keep everyone in the combat.
Keeping someone on your side conscious keeps his sword in the fight.
Healing a wound that doesn’t knock him out of combat might make him feel
better but doesn’t in itself help your side, and there will be time for healing
when the fight is over.
Keep in mind that it’s pretty hard to actually die in GURPS. Your character has
to get to full negative HP, and then fail an HT roll by more than 2. A good gen-
eral rule is to heal people when they get in negative HP range, but not much
before that, unless you have a character who only heals and doesn’t fight.

Tracking the Details
In This Chapter
 Creating and fine-tuning your character sheet
 Creating a background for your character 
 Tracking your points
 Keeping your GM happy
O
ne of the great things about GURPS is that it is a very detail-rich system.
Each character can be highly individual. In this chapter, we discuss cre-
ating the fine detail that gives your character a distinct place in the world, as
well as how to keep track of all these details.
Creating a Character Sheet
One of the side effects of GURPS being such a terrific system for character
creation is that documenting your GURPS character requires a lot of recorded
information. Most players use their own homemade character sheet templates,
but GURPS Basic Set: Characters gives you a well-laid-out character sheet tem-
plate (pages 335–336) that is really worth considering. If you don’t want to use
this sheet, it is well worth your trouble to look it over carefully and make sure
to include all the areas that this sheet covers, so that you aren’t scrambling for
the rule books during play. Organization is key; we highly recommend making
sure that all your combat information is on the same page, so you can see it all
at once.
Even if you do use the GURPS character sheet, there are several areas where
you might want to add more detail. The next few sections describe these
areas in greater detail.

Abilities
When you design an ability, it might be a conglomeration of any number of
limitations and enhancements. It is a good idea to note all these down, and
then write a clear description of how they work together. For example:
 Innate Attack: Burning Attack 3d; Area Effect, 4 yards, +100%; Cosmic,
Irresistible Attack, +300%; Emanation, –20%) [72]
What does it all mean? When this power is activated, your body sprays out a
wreath of blue-white flames (the Emanation limitation, the blue-white flame is
just one possibility for visual effects) that do 3d of damage (3 levels of burn-
ing) to everyone within 4 yards of you (due to Area Effect). (See Chapter 8 for
more on the Emanation limitation.) Damage Resistance is ignored (due to
Cosmic, Irresistible Attack). If a series of actions must be taken in a specific
order (for instance, you must activate before firing), it is worthwhile to note
that as well.
Magic spells
Although magic spells can be listed under skills, if your character is a mage
designed with ample character points, you may have too many to fit under
the Skills section. It is also handy to copy down useful information about the
spells, such as casting time, duration, point costs, and range. This will proba-
bly add another dedicated sheet to your character.
Chapter 7 describes the specifics of crafting a mage and generating the initial
entries in your spell list. You can find the information to fill in the details for
your spell chart in the Spell Table Appendix in GURPS Magic, page 223.
Reference material
Depending on the campaign, the GM may provide you with a basic descrip-
tion of the world your character will be adventuring in. Appending this to the
end of your character sheet can be a useful reference, even if you think you
basically know it. As the game goes on, the original details can grow fuzzy,
and sometimes you can get a lot of advantage from remembering the back-
ground stuff. Will posing as a priest get you into the government building that
citizens are usually denied access to? Perhaps the scrap iron that you stum-
ble across can be sold at a profit to the notoriously metal-poor halflings of
half-moon shire.
190
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

Contacts
Although Contacts are described in GURPS Basic Set: Characters as providing
a certain skill to the character, that is not all there is to their story. For the
price of a Contact you could simply buy the skill in question yourself. A con-
tact’s value comes in having access to sources of knowledge that wouldn’t be
available to you even if you had his skill. For example, a banker Contact
might be able to give you off-the-record information about the financial activi-
ties of a cult you’re investigating because she has access to their account
information. Because of this, it’s worth having a brief write-up of who your
Contact is, and just what sorts of things he has unusual access to.
Wealth
There is not too much to say about wealth, but if your character has a steady
income from a job, you’ll want to make sure to keep track of time to make
sure you get paid! You’ll also want to keep track of any possessions and cash
that you have. Don’t expect the GM to do this for you. And you never know
what item may prove to be useful later as the necessary component in some
arcane ritual.
A last note on character sheets: Steve Jackson Games sells a program called
GURPS Character Assistant that helps you design and print out characters in a
convenient format. It also allows you to create your own custom character
sheet.
Writing a Character Background
All characters have some sort of background to explain their circumstances.
Even if your character is a robot that just rolled off the assembly line, he still
must have some background that ties him in to the world. Why was he cre-
ated? How did he become “free”? Or if he is not free, who controls him?
Although it is not absolutely necessary to tell an elaborate background story
upfront, backgrounds can add a lot to the richness of the role you play.
We usually create character backgrounds in one of two ways:
 The most common way to create a character background starts with
looking over the character’s sheet and getting an idea of the character’s
personality based on her advantages, quirks, disadvantages, and perks.
Is she cowardly? Foolishly brave? Gullible? What factors do you see as
191
Chapter 12: Tracking the Details

being central to her personality? Some of this information may have
been part of the original character concept. Next, think about how to
bring the world setting into it. How would a person with the previously
described personality fit into the local culture? What would motivate her
to be involved in the proposed adventure?
 Another way to go about creating a character background is to take this
process in reverse: What role would you like to play in the campaign set-
ting? A fighter? A healer? An encyclopedia salesman? Imagine yourself in
such a role, and write your background to describe how you fit the image.
As with all creative endeavors, there is no one correct way of creating a 
character background. However, you should base it primarily on two things:
The setting in which the campaign will be taking place and the character’s
own attributes, advantages and disadvantages. Another good idea is to make
sure your character’s background explains her involvement in the type of
campaign being run, but this is less vital than the other two factors. It is not
that uncommon for characters to be swept up in an adventure that is outside
of the normal way they live their lives; however, in these cases you should
explain how your character was sucked into the thick of the action, and why
she doesn’t run from it at the first opportunity.
192
Part III: Playing with Your Character 
A sample character background
Here is an example background one of us wrote for a character in a Victorian campaign setting
where magic is part of day-to-day life.
Erica and Eryka were born on June 18th, 1856 in a suburb of
Bath, England. Their parents, Harris and Mary Grey, are
wealthy industrialists who had been trying to have children for
many years without success. They finally achieved their goal by
contracting with the king of a local faery shee, a being who
calls himself Tippet of the Rolling Hills. The contract stipulated
that Harris Grey was to pay Tippet two casks of fine dwarven
ale in return for seeing that his wife would become pregnant
with twins. Finding the specified ale to be outrageously expen-
sive and knowing that faeries must always keep their word,
Harris Grey purchased a single cask and had it divided into two
smaller casks specially made for the occasion. In punishment
for putting the “spirits” into two containers, Tippet caused the
twins’ two spirits to be put into one body, and thereby achieved
a sense of balance. Harris Grey tried to make it up to the
faeries by providing them with two more wine casks of tradi-
tional size, but rather than undo the curse (which he perhaps is
unable to do) Tippet gave them another child, this time, a son
named Harris Jr.

Logging the Adventure
Whether the campaign you’re playing in is an epic adventure or a dungeon
crawl, you will find tidbits of information along the way that you will want to
keep track of. For example, in a dungeon crawl you may wish to create a rough
map of the area you’re exploring so that you can find your way out again or
even notice areas that might contain hidden rooms. You will certainly want to
keep track of any loot you find! With epic adventures, you will run across all
sorts of important facts: names, places, clues, legends of missing artifacts, and
193
Chapter 12: Tracking the Details
The twins now must share their single body, with one having
possession of the communal body from noon until midnight,
and the other from midnight until noon. For simplicity’s sake,
Mary Grey named them Erica and Eryka, so that she could use
the same name no matter what time it was. Erica’s hair is
blonde, and Eryka’s is black, but otherwise there is no change
when they switch possession of the body. The two communicate
through a shared diary, so that they can keep abreast of each
other’s activities. For the most part they get along well, but do
occasionally play practical jokes on each other, the most popu-
lar one being to arrange to switch control of the bodies in a situ-
ation so as to leave the new occupant embarrassed.
Since birth, the twins have gotten along rather well with Tippet
and his clan, who feel some small measure of remorse for
afflicting innocent children with a curse. Harris Jr. is a year
younger than the twins. They get along with him fairly well, but
he is hungry for social position (he’s trying desperately to get a
peerage), which puts the twins off him a bit. It is also clear that
when he inherits, he is not planning on making any generous
offers of financial support.
The twin’s mother dotes on them, but their relations have
always been strained with their father. This tension is partly
because he is by nature a gruff and unreasonable man, and
partly because of the continued guilt he feels for getting the
curse inflicted on them (he never admits to this guilt, however,
even to himself). The girls went to boarding school in Salisbury,
where Eryka learned the rudiments of magery and showed
tremendous promise as an opera singer. Erica turned her hand
to thievery, specializing in picking pockets, and has become
quite an adept swordswoman. The pair later moved in with
their aunt Stephanie so that Eryka could take advantage of the
thriving opera scene in Vienna.

so on. You don’t want to arrive at the climactic conclusion of a years’ play by
bursting in the door of the dungeon and saying, “We’re here to rescue you,
Princess . . . uh . . . what’s your name again?”
Taking notes need not be cumbersome, and it fact it should not be. No one
wants to sit around while you take elaborate notes on contents of the king’s
knickknack shelf. It is also not necessary that everyone in the group take
notes, as long as someone is tracking the things you need to record such as:
 Names, places, and dates
 Special items you might find (be they magic or simply unusual). You
should also note where you found them, so that the GM will know what
you’re talking about when you ask about them later.
 Legends, rumors, and other pieces of information you run across
It can be helpful to keep very rough notes on the action of the adventure so
that your other notes have a bit of context.
Managing Your Points
During the course of play, your character earns character points to be used
to improve and develop his skills, remove disadvantages, raise attributes,
and sometimes even add advantages. How many points you are awarded
depends on the GM and what occurred during that particular gaming session.
The next few sections discuss the best ways to distribute these points to ben-
efit your character.
Improving skills
At the end of each night’s play, the GM awards each character a number of
points (called earned character points) with which to advance. At the end of
the evening (or before the start of the next session, depending on the flexibil-
ity of your GM), you can simply spend these points on any skills that you
used to some significant degree during the night’s play. Your GM will have to
determine what counts as “significant.” Improving during adventure (as this is
called) is the simplest way to improve your skills.
The other way of improving your skills is through study, which usually has to
happen between adventures. Using this method, your character earns extra
character points for the time he spends hitting the books. Because different
styles of study yield different results, the book uses the term “hours of learn-
ing” to mean something different than “hours of study.” For every 200 hours
of learning, you earn 1 character point in the skill you were studying. There
are three types of study your character can engage in: 
194
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

 Work experience
 Self-teaching
 Being taught by a teacher
The best form of study is being taught; every hour of being taught is an hour
of learning, so your character earns 1 character point for every 200 hours of
this kind of study. If you cannot find or cannot afford a teacher, you can learn
a skill on your own (although the GM may not allow this with all skills) by
195
Chapter 12: Tracking the Details
A sample character log
A fun but totally optional idea for keeping track
of details is to write a brief log or journal for your
character from the notes you take during
gaming. Such a diary not only tracks important
information, but also provides a narrative that
keeps the action of the game fresh in every-
body’s head, which can really help when a
couple weeks go by between sessions. It can
also be a tremendous help in developing your
character and in introducing either him or her
to the other players in the game.
. . . I met Draco in the fish market, according to
the instructions implicit in the hat she left me. I
appeared as a plump balding man in his late 50s,
and this time Draco was a middle-aged
craftswoman. She (and I use the sex of the
semblance, as I do not know Draco’s natural
gender) asked me how my cell was coming
along, and I answered her in vague but positive
terms. She then asked me if I was ready for our
first assignment, and I answered that I was, and
so she gave it to me.
It seems there is a mage named Arnie Boarmark,
who specializes in researching new spells. He
has authored two new combat spells, which
were to be given to the throne in a month’s time.
Surreptitiously, he had made arrangements to
turn copies of the spell over to an agent of Shah-
dath, a notorious necromancer wizard. The
spells were to be exchanged during a meeting in
the Skydome Pleasure Palace on the 13th of
June, two days from the time I was given the
assignment. The resistance did not know the
exact time or place of the meeting, but did know
that Boarmark had registered as Milo Boarman.
Further, they had learned that the meeting terms
allowed each side only two bodyguards. Our
assignment was to kill Boarmark and the agent
of Shah-dath, obtain or destroy the scrolls, and
make it as hard as possible for the spirits of these
folk to be summoned for questioning. I was
warned that we were to leave the personal
effects of the contingent from Shah-dath alone,
as Shah-dath would use them to track us down
and kill us.
I told her that my cell would be up to the assign-
ment, though in truth I didn’t like it too much. No
self-respecting assassin likes to work on such
short notice, with no time for background
checks and having to rely only on the informa-
tion of unknown allies. Boarmark, a mage who
researches combat spells, was not going to be
an easy opponent, and the situation left us little
scope for improvisation. Further, the Skydome
security is well-known for its competence, and
because the building floats in the air, escape
options are necessarily limited. Still, I felt that
we could likely either pull it off or determine
beforehand that the situation was hopeless,
and I have always wanted to see the inside of
the famous Skydome.

practice and reading. However, this method only gives you one hour of learn-
ing for every two hours of studying. You can also learn on the job, but this form
of study only gives you one hour of learning for every four hours of study. And
of course, your character has to have a job to take advantage of this.
As you can see, tracking all this can get complicated if you dabble in a few
things here and there between adventuring and working a job. Again, it’s
handy to use a simple form such as the one in Figure 12-1 to track your hours.
Changing advantages, disadvantages, 
and attributes
It is also possible to use your earned character points to buy new advan-
tages; increase your ST, IQ, DX, and HT; and to remove disadvantages. Sadly,
with the exception of a few advantages, you cannot earn points through
study for these purposes; you are limited to character points you earned
during adventure. The advantages you can gain through study are listed on
page 294 of GURPS Basic Set: Characters.
In order to add an advantage, you not only need to come up with the points,
but you also have to be able to explain how your character acquired the new
advantage in the action of the game. With some advantages this is easy, but
many advantages are not available after the start of play. There are no hard-
and-fast rules as to which advantages you can add after character creation
because so much depends on the campaign. Adding Military Rank might be
trivial in a modern campaign, whereas in a swords-and-sorcery campaign
there might be absolute limits on the Rank that someone who is not of noble
birth can achieve. In a futuristic campaign, your character might be able to
stop by the local tissue engineering lab and have gills installed. The GM is the
arbiter of what is possible, and if you have your eye on adding a specific
advantage later, you should ask about it.
Figure 12-1:
A sample
skill log.
196
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

Removing disadvantages works along the same lines. It is possible for a char-
acter to overcome a fear of heights, but she will not re-grow a lost limb unless
there is something in the campaign that makes this possible. The GM, of
course, is the final arbiter of that. Unfortunately, you cannot earn extra points
by acquiring new disadvantages. If your arm is bitten off by a dragon during
play, about the only benefit it gives you is a good story to tell at the tavern.
Raising attributes is usually just a matter of paying the points necessary to
buy another level of the attribute (10 points for ST and HT, 20 for IQ and DX),
but your character should expect to spend some game time working on this
change. For example, she might lift weights if she wants to become stronger.
Tracking point changes
Tracking and spending character points seems like a straightforward and self-
explanatory task, and for the most part it is. However, if you aren’t careful,
you’ll be surprised how easy it is to lose track of your points. It’s surprisingly
easy to forget to write down points you’ve been awarded at the end of a long
night’s play. It’s also easy to confuse yourself by adding points to a skill or
advantage, but forgetting to mark them off the points in your character bank,
or by talking to the GM about spending points between sessions, and then not
remembering if you actually marked them off the next time you game.
Even if your mind is like a steel bear trap and you never make these mistakes,
it’s good to keep a detailed record so that you can always square your account-
ing with the GM’s records. If she makes the mistake, you’ll want to be able to
show that your version is accurate.
The best way to do this is instead of just jotting points down in the corner of
your sheet, scratching them out, and writing over them again, is keeping a
chronological record of the points you earned and what you’ve spent them
on, much like the one in Figure 12-2. When you earn points for a session’s
play, be sure to write down the date.

Chapter 12: Tracking the Details

What GMs Want from Their Players
GURPS (and any other role playing game) is an exercise in cooperative story
telling. It’s easy to fall into the habit of letting the GM shoulder most of the
burden in this. After all, you just control one character; the GM controls the
entire rest of the universe! But do not minimize your role in making the game
fun, especially for the GM.
The fun of being GM lies in creating an engaging world for the players to
explore. If you show your interest in the campaign by taking the extra time to
really read and remember the campaign’s background material, write a back-
ground to fit, and maybe even create a character log, the GM will feel
rewarded for his work and in turn will become more invested in his creation,
making the game even more fun.
As GM, you can encourage your players to become involved with a little
bribery. Giving out occasional good-role-playing bonus points for creating a
good character background and keeping a clear and detailed log can do won-
ders for your players’ motivation.

R
oleplaying is what sets GURPS apart from games like Monopoly and
chess. You don’t just control a piece that moves around a board, you
actually play the personality of a (usually) heroic figure, a personality of your
own creation. In this chapter, we explore the idea of role playing, as well as
ideas for getting the most out of your experience.
Sharing the Storytelling
It’s easy to think of the GM as your enemy. After all, she spends an unsettling
portion of her time thinking of ways to torment, kill, and generally thwart
your character’s dreams. Good GMs are often labeled “sadistic,” a title they
wear as a badge of honor. But really, GURPS is an exercise in shared story-
telling, and the GM provides the main plotline and enough challenges to make
the players’ victories meaningful. If the GM were nice to you all the time and
made things easy for your character, you would soon be bored.
Your job as a player is not merely to overcome everything the GM throws
your way, but to give richness to the story of the campaign. You don’t need to
be a great actor to do this, but you should strive to make your character
behave as if he has a realistic personality and is not just a strategically
played game piece that always does what is most advantageous. If you’ve
been through Chapter 3, you may well have your character’s personality
defined by now, but in this chapter, we attempt to help you smooth off the
rough edges.

Being a team player
All the characters do not have to get along in perfect harmony all the time,
but it really is a good idea to try and be part of a team with your party. Party
fights get old in a hurry and take the fun out of gaming for everyone. Besides,
it wouldn’t make sense for a group of characters who hate each other to hang
around together. For the sake of realism as well as harmony of the gaming
group, try to create a character who is not just going to be a problem for
everyone else.
This is one of the reasons you should talk about your character with other
players in the group before the character is finalized. A  wizard who special-
izes in fire spells brought into a party with three pyrophobics might be funny
for a while, but the novelty quickly wears off. It’s also a short step from char-
acters that don’t get along to players who don’t get along. In the short run, a
bit of character conflict can be both fun and funny, but if it’s carried on too
long, players’ feelings start to get involved. No one likes to be picked on or
teased continually, even through fictional character intermediaries.
Playing your disadvantages
You will find that your disadvantages are more likely to define your character’s
personality than anything else. This is because by their very nature, disadvan-
tages limit your character’s actions in one way or another. You’ll notice that
even traits which we think of as “good” are often listed as disadvantages — for
example, Truthfulness and Charitable. Even though these are considered pos-
itive traits, your character is compelled to engage in them even when they
are not convenient. If your character is charitable, he must aid everyone who
asks, while a less kind person is free to pursue her own goals.
When you select disadvantages for your character, we highly recommend
that you think about what they mean and take only the ones that you will be
happy playing. (Chapter 5 gives some advice as you consider the various dis-
advantages available.). The game does provide a dice-roll mechanic for deter-
mining how often you succumb to your mental disadvantages, but it’s the
mark of a good role player not to have to roll too often. Take disadvantages
that you will have fun playing and realize that playing them can be part of the
fun, and try to roll to resist your disadvantages only when the character
knows her butt is on the line if she doesn’t.
Keep in mind that someone with a disadvantage is going to display fairly
extreme behavior. Most people are somewhat honest, but a character with
the Honesty disadvantage is going to wait for the light to turn green even
when bad guys are hot on his tail! Most people are somewhat curious, but
someone with the Curious disadvantage is going to unwrap all her Christmas
200
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

presents early, read her friends’ mail when they aren’t looking, and put her
finger in the light socket because she just has to know what it’s like.
Disadvantages often work together to define your character, and you should
think about how you’re going to explain your personality before you start
play. Make sure your disadvantages work together in a rational way. For
example, it’s impossible to be both a Bully and Charitable at the same time.
Here is an example of how two disadvantages can be matched to help form a
personality:
Iff Lightpaw is a girl of 14 who comes from a primitive barbarian tribe, of
which all the members are were-creatures. She was captured and forced to
work for a circus at age 9, and has recently escaped to face life on her own.
She has the following disadvantages: Bloodlust, Gullibility, Truthfulness, and
a Wealth level of Poor.
Putting these together, the player has decided that she is young and naïve 
to an extreme degree, and thus neither lies nor expects anyone else to. Her
worldview is simple — if someone is your enemy, you should kill him; if he
isn’t, there is no sense in trying to deceive him. She is kind and sweet-
tempered to her friends. To her enemies, well, she turns into a panther and
eats them!
Acting Out Social Interactions
In many ways, the crux of role playing games is social interaction. The
combat parts are fun, but taken by themselves, they make for no more than a
tabletop war game. Social interactions in the game are what separate role play-
ing games from the rest of the herd. GURPS allows for two methods of running
social interactions — with dice and by role playing the character. We discuss
both of these methods, although in practice they are most often used together.
Role playing social interactions
When your character meets an NPC he is interested in talking to, you as a
player are expected to speak to that NPC through your character. In doing so,
you have to keep in mind who your character is and act like the character
rather than like yourself. Your disadvantages do not just determine when you
have to roll dice to complete an action; you must incorporate them into your
vision of the character and into your role playing. If your character has the
Shyness disadvantage, you shouldn’t be chatting up a beautiful NPC. Similarly,
if your character suffers from Lecherousness, you should be chatting up
everyone who catches your eye, even if it’s not convenient.
201
Chapter 13: Playing the Role

Role playing can become particularly challenging when your character has 
a markedly different personality or markedly different interpersonal skills
than you do. For example, if you are called upon to negotiate a treaty with a
neighboring kingdom on behalf of your king, and your character has a high
Diplomacy skill score, your character should be able to do a good job at the
bargaining table. This may not be something you are good at in real life, and
you may have difficulty acting the part for that bit of play. If you find yourself
in this situation, you should roll the dice against your skill level, and the GM
should give you advice and responses according to the roll. If you make your
skill roll handily, the GM should assume that your character is being convinc-
ing even if you yourself can’t think of any smooth or clever circumlocutions
to use. The GM should also give you a few hints as to whether you’re asking
for too much or not enough because your character is supposed to be an
expert on the subject.  But in the end, you should still try and come up with
some dialogue for your character to say.
Resolving social interactions 
with dice rolls
From time to time, an important social interaction may take too long to role
play, either because the negotiations are lengthy and intricate or because a
character has skills that the player just doesn’t have at all. In those cases,
rolling the dice is the best way to handle these social situations. A character
with high skill levels of Performance and Public Speaking, for example, can be
expected to be able to give an impromptu speech that will hold an audience’s
interest. The player may not be able to do this, however, and it would be both
painful and a waste of time for the GM to make you get up and talk. In such
circumstances, the GM should just let you roll the dice and determine the
audience’s reaction based on how well you beat your skill.
Separating player knowledge 
from character knowledge
Good role playing requires that you keep information that you know separate
from what your character knows. A lot of times, you will find that you know
things that your character doesn’t have any way of knowing. For example, if
another player’s character is kidnapped when your character wasn’t present,
your character shouldn’t know anything is wrong. You really should try to do
your best to act as if you don’t know that information, and shouldn’t have
your character guess the truth based on flimsy evidence.
202
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

Another common problem comes from players knowing things that their
characters shouldn’t know because the technology level of the campaign may
be much lower than modern technology. When playing in a campaign set in
ancient times, it’s tempting for players to want their characters to devise
simple but useful items that they know of but that weren’t around in the time
of the campaign. For example, you might want your character to invent the
stirrup, which is an attractively straightforward item that you can have a
blacksmith bang out for you quickly. It may seem obvious with the benefit of
hindsight, but a lot of horsemen rode horses without stirrups for a long time,
and it was not obvious to them.
As GM, you should watch for characters acting on information that they
should not have. If a character wants to invent items that the player knows
about but the character does not, you should disallow it unless he has the
Gadgeteer advantage. If he wants to become rich and famous off the item,
you should require him to buy levels of Wealth and Reputation. Never allow
an invention if it’s going to ruin the flavor of the game. When characters act
as if they know things they shouldn’t know, you should be sure to penalize
them character points for the session for bad role playing.
It’s also worth noting that this issue cuts both ways — you have to be fair to
your players and not have your NPCs react using your knowledge of the
player character’s capabilities. If a player comes up with a brilliant strategy
to handily defeat your bad guys and mentions it beforehand, you just have to
lump it and not have your NPCs react as if they knew about it. The game
works best for both players and GM when the players are not penalized for
saying too much too early.
203
Chapter 13: Playing the Role
Rules lawyering for fun and profit
A rules lawyer is a player who spends a lot of
time trying to get the GM to make generous
interpretations of the rules. This is sometimes
appropriate, but generally speaking, it’s a bad
habit to get into. The GM’s word is law, and it’s
best to try to be a good sport about it and not
ruin everyone’s fun by carrying on about how
you think the rules ought to be read. When you
do engage in rules lawyering, we suggest the
following guidelines:
 Say your peace and then accept the GM’s
judgment with good grace.
 Realize that the GM has to keep the game
balanced in order for it to be fun. Don’t ask
for rulings that make your character an
unstoppable force because, if your GM is
foolish enough to let you get away with it,
the challenge of the game will be ruined.
 Don’t just argue to see what you can get
away with.
The point of good rules lawyering, then, should
be to improve the game for everyone, not just to
make your character more powerful. If you are
willing to give as well as take, the GM will be
much more willing to give you what you want.

Seeking fun versus success
One common element of all GURPS campaigns is that they all are set up to
challenge the characters to succeed in some course of action. Be it carting
back treasure from a dungeon or foiling a master criminal, the game is about
the characters doing their best to succeed in the face of adversity.
In a good campaign, many of the rewards built into the game — magic or spe-
cial items, money to buy needed equipment, or character points to make the
character more effective — are designed to make the characters more capa-
ble. It’s easy for you to focus on character power and character improvement
as the primary goal of the game. However, overemphasizing this aspect of the
game misses a good part of the point of role playing games.
Much of the fun is in the story of the game, and the characters who are the
most fun to play are often not the most powerful ones, but rather the ones
with funny or endearing personalities. Think of it this way: No matter how
powerful your character gets, the GM will adjust your opponents to match
you. If you gain a power to overcome certain obstacles, the GM will just find
new obstacles to challenge you with. Over time, you’ll notice that it isn’t nec-
essarily more fun to play in high-powered high-point-value games.
What to Do between Fights
Not every GURPS campaign involves a lot of fighting, but the majority of
them do. This is why so many of the rules are about the finer points of
combat rather than, say, diplomacy or contract bridge. However, we find that
the game is much more fun if you don’t concentrate solely on combat and
make sure to enjoy the other parts of the game as well. The parts of the game
that happen between fights can give you the most scope for role playing.
Solving puzzles and problems
If you are willing to concentrate on things other than fighting, you can often
avoid combat or get a useful edge by spending some time having your char-
acter do some investigating rather than just charging into all situations with
her sword drawn.
Are people disappearing into the mysterious temple and not coming out? It’s
much better to ask around and look for any hints, legends, or rumors that
you can take advantage of before you knock on the door. Do the priests 
204
Part III: Playing with Your Character 

of the temple come out only at night? Are large wolf tracks often seen around
the temple? Does the town drunk claim to have seen the high priestess flying
through the midnight air with horns and a barbed tail, but no one believes
him?
Seeking out these things ahead of time can not only increase your chances of
survival, but it can be fun as well. Sleuthing gives you a chance to match wits
with the GM and to play your character’s personality to the fullest by inter-
acting with all the NPCs of the campaign.
Having a life
It can also be fun to give your character a life outside the plot of the cam-
paign. Where does your character live? Does he have any family? Does she
collect fancy hats? Does he belong to any social clubs? Having a life outside
of the campaign can give your character richness and make her more fun to
role play within the campaign. It can also give the GM something to tie your
character into the plot with. Yes, GMs will sometimes use these details
against you, but overcoming conflict is a major part of the fun.
These sorts of details make your character feel more real and therefore more
fun to play.
Having goals
You can also go beyond just having a detailed life for your character and
actually have goals that are not directly related to the plot of the campaign.
They need not be complicated; in one campaign, a character dreamed of
building a house with a large ballroom and throwing elegant social events. On
the other hand, complicated goals can be even better; another character who
was a member of the lesser nobility sought to carve out his own fiefdom from
wild territory, and the player had a good time designing how his government
would work and what the legal code would be like.
If you do this, it’s best to not fight the GM on these things. Your character’s
goals should not interfere with the campaign or make the other players
spend a lot of time watching you do things that bear no relevance to them-
selves. If you are careful not to intrude on the campaign in these ways, your
character’s goals will for the most part add to everyone’s fun.

Sample characters: Biographies
Stuart’s “Normal” Character
Jessica Delacourt was raised a devout Catholic
and still attends church regularly. Her father
was a cop, and Jessica was raised with a very
strong sense of right and wrong as well as a
belief that one should take action when possi-
ble. When the priest talked about evil in the
night, she was one of the few who took him lit-
erally. As a result, she’s made a career out of
investigating the unholy and, when possible,
putting it to rest. Frequently, this has led her into
confrontations with human evil, and that has led
to her developing contacts within the law
enforcement community (particularly a friendly
FBI agent named John Coyote). She supports
herself by selling articles of her exploits to the
tabloids, and her editor, Irina Malcote, is
another key contact for her. These days, she’s
looking to find a group to work with as things
have begun to get more dangerous in the city.
She’s 5’7”, has long dark hair (usually in a pony-
tail), brown eyes, and olive skin. She’s usually
dressed in jeans, a loose blouse, and a cam-
eraman’s vest (with various artifacts in the
pockets). She carries a Glock nine-millimeter
but is familiar with a variety of handguns.
Bjoern’s Mage Character
Opie Mossytoes was born and grew up in the
isolated and idyllic halfling community of
Marshberry. He is the eighth child and only son
of Barny and Bea Mossytoes. Even as an infant,
Opie was surrounded by odd goings-on; strange
manifestations, visitations, and supernatural
emanations became routine occurrences in the
Mossytoes household. As Opie grew older and
was able to play in and around the village, the
weirdness started coming to the attention of
other members of the community, and senti-
ment against Opie began growing. Eventually,
when Opie was 12 years old, the community
elders sent him into exile. Fortunately for young
Mossytoes, he was rescued by a wandering
mage, Calgaron the Munificent, who took Opie
in and trained him in magic and helped him bond
to Toby, his Wolpertinger Familiar. In just the last
few weeks, Calgaron was killed in an ambush
by an old enemy, who now is tracking down
Opie. This hero is looking for a band of stalwart
companions that he can join who will fight for
him when and if the enemy confronts him again.
Of course, Opie won’t admit anything to the
party until he absolutely has to.
Adam’s Supers Character
Anna Connors was an archaeology student
working on a dig in the Amazon rainforest. One
day, she got lost in the dense underbrush and
ended up falling through the damp turf into an
ancient buried temple. Fascinated, she spent
the rest of the evening exploring, and at night
took shelter in the largest room of the complex,
under a massive statue of a serpent done up in
unusual red pottery and gilded with gold leaf.
That night, she dreamed that she was con-
fronted by a magnificent serpent in the jungle,
whose body stretched so far that it disappeared
into the mist behind it. The serpent offered her
the chance to be its champion against the dark
forces of the world. It offered her some gifts of
power to help her with the quest. She readily
accepted and in the morning emerged from the
temple as Anaconda, the Snake God’s avenger.

 Helping players manage their characters
 Interpreting the rules
 Streamlining your management of combat
A
GURPS session requires not only a few players, but also one person to
manage the adventure — the Game Master, or GM. The players’ respon-
sibilities include creating their characters and managing the actions of those
characters during play. The GM has an entirely different set of responsibilities,
including creating the adventure, managing the character-creation process,
managing combat, and interpreting the rules. This section of the book intro-
duces you to the wonderful world of GMing. It’s a lot of fun, but also a lot of
work, and it’s best to start prepared.
We start by providing an overview of what’s involved in being a GM. Chapter 15
gives you advice on creating your first adventure. And Chapter 16 gives some
advice on interacting with the players as people, rather than as characters. 
If, after you’ve gotten a taste of GMing, you really want to get serious about it,
be sure to check out Part V, which gives you information about turning your
adventure into a campaign and even creating your own gaming world.
Introducing the Campaign
If you want to be a GM, you need two things:
 Players to provide a cast of characters
 Something for those characters to do

210
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 
Even if you’re just running a quick and simple adventure, you’ll need to have
some idea beforehand of what you want the party of characters to do. Will
they be soldiers in ancient Rome? Or space merchants in the middle of a
galaxy-wide civil war? The players will want some sort of basic introduction
to the action so they can create appropriate characters.
We find it’s helpful to give your players an introductory write-up for your
world. This can be as simple or as complex as you’d like. A page or two is
often fine, but in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign, which we discuss in Part V, the
introductory material was nearly 200 pages long!
The main things your players need to know are
 What is the campaign about? Are the characters villagers under attack
by goblin hordes? Are they living on campus at a magical university? Are
they CIA operatives?
 What is the technology level of the campaign? Will they be using flint
spears or lasers?
 What sorts of special or supernatural abilities are allowed in the cam-
paign? Can the characters be superheroes? Wizards?
 What sorts of races are allowed as player characters?
 What special rules pertain specifically to the campaign? Is the mana
level very high or nonexistent? Do most people on the street possess a
superpower?
 What social, cultural, and resource issues are important? Are all blond
people killed on sight? Is everyone without skills in basket-weaving
looked on as a barbarian? Is it a high-tech world, but one without metal?
You can add any number of other details to these basic categories, or anything
else you want to, but at a minimum, make sure you let your players know
ahead of time both what is expected of them and what is and isn’t allowed.
No, Your Wizard Can’t Have a Machine
Gun — Reviewing Characters
One of the most important jobs of a GM is to review the players’ characters
at the start of a campaign. Because role playing games are an exercise in
shared storytelling, it is important to have a good set of characters in your
game if everything is going to come off correctly. If you envision a complex

campaign involving mystery and intrigue, with the characters engaging in
subtle behind-the-scenes manipulation, and you are presented with a cast of
characters consisting mostly of barbarians with the Berserk disadvantage,
you’re going to be hard-pressed to realize your vision. Ideally, you can mini-
mize this problem by giving your players clear guidance on what sort of game
you’re hoping to run with your introductory world write-up. However, charac-
ter review is your last defense against allowing a party that does not suit the
campaign, so be prepared to speak up or forever hold your peace. As GM,
you have veto power over any character you don’t find suitable for your cam-
paign, although this is a last resort; you should do your best to address prob-
lems before you get to that stage.
Character power levels
You’ll find that some players seek to take advantage of loopholes, synergistic
effects of certain abilities, and, in some cases, interpretations of the rules
that you don’t necessarily agree with. We find that you can save yourself
quite a bit of effort by announcing up front your intention to do away 
with game-unbalancing abilities, whether they are technically legal or not.
Encourage people to check with you during character creation to find out
whether you’re going to allow any tricky shtick they might have in mind so
that they won’t be disappointed after it’s too late to change.
To look for this kind of thing during character review, pay special attention to
supernatural abilities and spells, especially spells taken to such a high skill
level that they can be cast quickly or maintained for free. Usually, when a
player does this, he has something tricky in mind, and you should ask or
figure out what it is.
On the other side of the coin, some players have a tendency to create ineffec-
tive characters. For several reasons, such players can present a bigger prob-
lem than players who try to unbalance the game with their powers.
 It’s more fun if everyone is enjoying herself. If one of the players’ charac-
ters is seriously outclassed, that player may not find herself with much
to do during the game.
 In a group with several ineffective characters (or in a small gaming
group), the party can end up being unable to accomplish the goals you
set for them.
It is to your advantage, then, to try to get players to meet somewhere in the
middle. You may want to give character creation hints to players whose char-
acters do not seem up to snuff. Don’t try to write the characters for them
211
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

(unless they want that much help), but try to urge them to get in line with the
other players in the party. Sometimes you can get the players who excel at
creating characters to work with the less experienced players. Not only does
this get the party of characters working together from the start, but it also
gives the power gamers a chance to feel appreciated.
Point crocks
Point crock is our house term for a disadvantage or limitation that gives a
character more points than it’s worth, or in some cases for an underpriced
advantage. Other times, you can get abilities, limitations, or disadvantages
that aren’t well balanced with their points if you take them to the extreme.
Often, the problem in that situation is that the possible responses of the GM
become equally extreme. The GURPS system does a pretty good job of bal-
ancing things, but because the setting in which you play can vary so much,
it’s possible that sometimes the value of something is exaggerated, or the
penalty for something is ignored.
For example, one of Adam’s least favorite point crocks involves Gadget
Limitations. Take a superhero campaign in which characters are built with 400
character points, with a 50-point limit to disadvantages. One player decides to
build a gadget-based character called the Mad Hatter, who has a magical hat
that gives him an assortment of powers. The hat is breakable, but magically
tough with a DR of 5 and a –15 percent limitation. It has a size modifier of –4, so
it is plainly visible for a –15 percent limitation. It can be stolen, but is held to
the Hatter’s head magically unless grabbed when he’s not looking, which is a
–20 percent limitation. The hat is Unique, so if it’s stolen it can’t be replaced,
for another –25 percent limitation.
In total, the Mad Hatter gets –75 percent in limitations for every power the hat
grants him. In other words, if the other characters in this campaign spend an
average of 200 points on powers, the Mad Hatter gets to spend the equivalent
of 800 points because of these limitations. This is a huge advantage, and the
GM, who should often use those limitations to the character’s detriment, may
find herself at a loss. If you are the GM, how many avenues are really open to
you? If you destroy the hat, the character becomes useless. The hat is Unique
and therefore can’t be replaced. If you’re just planning on destroying the
character’s powers, why not ask the player to make a different character in
the first place? You can have the hat stolen, and make the party work to get 
it back, but how many times can you use that plot thread before everyone
gets bored? At the same time, because the Mad Hatter has 800 points of 
abilities before the gadget limitations are taken into account, you’re going to 
have a heck of a time coming up with villains to oppose him that don’t totally 
outclass the rest of the party. And will villains who don’t outclass the rest of
the party even be able to approach the Mad Hatter to steal his hat? These
212
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

limitations force a binary response from the GM; either the character’s powers
are extremely powerful or else they’re not there at all — there isn’t any inter-
mediate way to respond.
Other point crocks include
 Codes of Honor that require the player to do things the whole party was
going to do anyway
 Phobias of things that aren’t likely to come into play in the campaign
 Low levels of Wealth in a campaign in which the characters can expect
to loot large sums of cash off the fallen villains (though it can be fun to
continually push such characters back into poverty)
Some point crocks can be unintentional. The player may not know that 
her disadvantage is not going to come into play very often. As the GM, you
should have at least some kind of idea of what sorts of things the party is
going to encounter, so make sure to think about these things during charac-
ter review.
Things that drive GMs crazy
As a GM, you will find that some perfectly legitimate advantages or disadvan-
tages end up making you crazy, and you should discourage people from taking
them, limit the number of characters who can take them, or make them out-
right off-limits. You may find that some things bother you that other GMs
have no difficulty with or that you might not mind in a different campaign.
Creating a party that consists of characters that you are comfortable with is
important, so try to identify problems early on. Every GM ends up with a list
of advantages and disadvantages that he doesn’t want to deal with; create
your list before people create characters.
From our experience, for example, Weirdness Magnet can be difficult to GM in
a serious “realistic” campaign. Not only does it require you to come up with
strange things to happen to the character, but because it’s a fairly hefty 15-
point disadvantage, those strange things really ought to cause problems for
the character and not just be weird. In some campaigns, this would just be
irritating rather than something you could fit into the plot. Our recommenda-
tion is that if you allow this disadvantage (and it can be fun), think carefully
about allowing no more than one character to take it, unless you’re prepared
for an extremely surreal campaign.
You should also look over characters’ special abilities to make sure you’re
okay with what they can do. A character who can fly can be a huge amount of
trouble if you weren’t planning to have foes with significant missile weapons.
213
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

A character who can read minds might be fine in one campaign but totally
short-circuit your plot in another. Characters who can take down their ene-
mies with a single shot (for example, a character with a powerful Affliction
ability) can also cause you a lot of grief, especially if you were planning on
using a few powerful foes rather than hordes of lesser ones.
Anachronisms
Sometimes your players will try to do something that you didn’t mean to allow
in your campaign. Some players will assume that because an advantage or dis-
advantage is in the book, it must be available in your campaign. You can avoid
most of these issues by giving your players a clear campaign write-up to work
with, but you’ll be surprised how often players will find something you didn’t
think about. A player may see that you intend to run a TL3 swords-and-sorcery
campaign, create a Gadgeteer, and blithely start building a machine gun, which
may not be the flavor you had in mind.
Mistakes
Don’t assume players have done their math right; even the most mathemati-
cally inclined make the occasional mistake. It’s very easy to find yourself a
couple of points off at the end of character creation when you’re working and
reworking your skills list.
It is also worth having a careful look at any special abilities the player may
have designed. As we explain in Chapter 9, designing abilities can be quite
complicated, and you want to make sure that they are planned in a sensible
way and that both you and the player understand how they are going to be
handled.
After the review
One last note about character review: Sometimes players don’t get a good feel
for their characters until after they’ve run them a time or two. If you feel gener-
ous, it’s not a bad idea to give your players a chance to trade in a disadvantage
or quirk that isn’t working out as well as they’d hoped. The game is at its best if
everyone has a character that he or she enjoys playing, and usually, switching 
a few disadvantages for ones of equal value doesn’t disturb the campaign too
much. However, we recommend against allowing players to switch advantages
to ones they suddenly see will be more valuable than they thought.
214
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

One method of avoiding all the above problems is for the GM to help design
each character based on an interview. Just sit down with the player and allow
him to describe the character he wants to run, and help him translate his
ideas into GURPS stats. This way, you can discuss the possible discrepancies
before pen hits paper. Keep in mind, though, that this method is most useful
with new players; more experienced players may resent that much GM inter-
ference into their creative process.
The GM Cheat Sheet
As the GM, you’re expected to know all the rules (or at least enough to keep
the game flowing smoothly) and to be able to make up new ones on the fly if
the action of the game calls for it. This is not as bad as it sounds, but it is
helpful to have some of the key rules noted down and at hand before you
start the game.
The GM screen
How you organize your information is a matter of taste, but many GMs prefer
to use a GM screen. A tear-out GM screen has been included at the front of
this book, and we believe you’ll find it very handy. GM screens serve the dual
role of keeping charts and tables handy and keeping players from seeing your
written material.
If you don’t want to use a GM screen, the following are some things that you’ll
want to have readily available:
 The range/speed table
 The critical hit and critical miss tables
 The critical spell failure table (if you have magic in your campaign)
 The random hit location table
 The NPC reaction table
 The fright check table
This information can be found in GURPS Basic Set.  Steve Jackson Games also
sells an official GURPS GM’s Screen, available through your local hobby store
or online at www.warehouse23.com/item.html?id=SJG01-0005.

Chapter 14: Playing the GM

Keeping notes on your players’ characters
GURPS characters can be quite complicated, and it’s your job as GM to keep
track of at least the most important details of each of them. One of the things
you should do to prepare to GM a session is to make careful notes on the
characters in your campaign.
Exactly what notes you keep are up to you, and different GMs do things differ-
ently. You want to find a balance between not leaving out pieces of informa-
tion you’re likely to need often, and having so much info at hand that you can
never find anything without shuffling through a lot of papers.
A good place to start is to make a list of all the characters. Do this in order of
Basic Speed, from the highest to the lowest. Because characters act in order
of Basic Speed, it allows you to read down the list in combat situations or 
any time that people want to do things at the same time. Because it’s possible
for your players to adjust their characters’ Basic Speed up or down, and
because it’s advantageous to bump their characters’ Basic Speed up to the
next whole number, you will likely have a lot of ties between the characters.
After you list all the characters in order by Basic Speed, you can start adding
details to this list. You want to know each character’s Damage Resistance, so
when they take damage, you can subtract it and tell them the bad news. Be
sure to be consistent when you do this — it is very frustrating for players to
be uncertain whether the number you provide is before or after being adjusted
for the effects of armor.
You might want to note any of the characters’ abilities or disadvantages that
you need to keep in mind, particularly ones that change the way you need 
to interact with the players. You need to be aware of advantages like Danger
Sense because they take effect before the players can remind you about them.
You also want to keep track of disadvantages, such as Phobias, Vulnerabilities,
and Enemies, so that you can be sure to make the character who has them pay.
Finally, record any pieces of information about the characters that the play-
ers themselves don’t even know, such as the details of an Enemies disadvan-
tage when the enemy is unknown. And be sure to record things that happen
during play that you want to remember about the character’s interactions,
possessions, or knowledge. Maybe that cool sword a character found in the
last adventure was stolen from the Dragon Anthraxis, and he’s been looking
for it ever since! Such items also should be noted on your sheet.
If any character has a complicated ability, it is handy to keep notes about
how it works — what rolls the player has to make to activate it, and most
importantly, what rolls your NPCs have to make to resist it. You might want
216
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

to check out the GM Control Sheet on page 568 of GURPS Basic Set:
Campaigns; it’s a handy way of keeping track of this kind of information.
Some GMs prefer to keep abbreviated character sheets handy for all the 
characters. You can find an abbreviated form on page 569 of GURPS Basic Set:
Campaigns that is designed for NPCs. If your gaming group isn’t too big, you
can fill out one of these for each character in your campaign.
Keeping Your Players Honest 
(Or Dishonest)
One of the jobs of the GM is to make sure that players play their characters
properly. You don’t need to micromanage them, and in fact you should be
careful not to. A character’s personality is up to the player, and you should
give them leeway to figure out what it is. However, if a character is getting
points for a disadvantage, that disadvantage should come into play.
It’s worthwhile to take note of advantages that affect a player’s personality.
These include such items as Gullibility, Honesty, Truthfulness, Laziness, and
Bad Temper. Such disadvantages require the character to act in certain ways
in certain situations. Most of these disadvantages allow a self-control roll to
resist having to act on them. Nevertheless, a good role player shouldn’t always
try to resist. Someone with a bad temper usually doesn’t mind yelling and
screaming, and a lazy person isn’t going to try and whip himself on in any-
thing but the direst of emergencies.
In practice, after a player gets the hang of a character, you won’t have to pay
as much attention to these disadvantages. But it’s good to keep reminding
your players of how their characters are supposed to behave until their per-
sonalities get good and established.
Some disadvantages require the GM’s interaction in order to disadvantage
the character. Examples of this sort of disadvantage include Enemies, Phobias,
low Status, bad Reputation, and Weirdness Magnet. These are particularly
important to keep watch of because if you don’t work them into the cam-
paign, nothing will ever come of them.
Before you sit down to write your adventure, you should review a copy of
each character sheet. That way, you can be sure to take advantage of all the
special character buttons at your disposal.
217
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

Making and Breaking the Rules
We strongly recommend the point of view that all the rules in GURPS are sug-
gestions. Feel free to change or ignore any rules that you don’t like. In fact,
none of us have ever played with any GM who did everything absolutely by
the book. In some cases, a rule that you really like will not be appropriate for
a certain campaign you want to run. Customizable is the watchword of GURPS.
Keep in mind, though, that this doesn’t mean that the rules can be applied
arbitrarily. Whatever decisions you make about the rules, your players need
to know them and will expect you to enforce them consistently.
Rules interpretations on the fly
The rules cannot anticipate every situation, and many times you will find
yourself interpreting the rules (or in some cases creating new rules) on the
spot. If a character wants to dump a barrel of acid on a foe standing at the
bottom of a cliff, what skill does she roll against? How fast can a flying charac-
ter push a boat? Are Hindu vampires afraid of crosses?
There are no right or wrong answers to these questions, but there are more-
and less-workable answers. You should decide based on several criteria:
 Is the resulting rule reasonable and fair?
 Does it threaten campaign balance?
 Is the situation going to come up often enough to justify a complex rule
instead of a quick die roll?
 Is it reasonably consistent with other GURPS rules?
You make two types of rules interpretations: ones that have long-lasting
effects on the campaign, and ones that just get you through a particular situa-
tion. With rules interpretations that cover things that are going to happen
over and over, you are establishing how that rule will work for the campaign.
The most common example of this situation is interpreting how characters’
powers or skills work. For example, does the Iron Arm spell (GURPS Magic,
page 169) stop a Force Sword that would normally cut iron?
You want to avoid making a ruling merely to get the result you want in the sit-
uation at hand. The players feel it’s unfair for you to use harsh rules interpre-
tations to undo their brilliant ideas just because you don’t want to deal with
218
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

the results. On the other hand, if you let the players do things too easily, you
rob them of a chance to rise to a challenge.
Take the question of whether Hindu vampires are afraid of crosses, as an
example. You can interpret this situation in several ways. You could rule that
repelling vampires is a property of the holiness of crosses, and thus the vam-
pire’s beliefs are irrelevant and Hindu vampires should still shy away from
crosses. You could rule that vampirism is a Christian curse, and thus Christian
symbols are relevant despite the beliefs of the vampire. Or you could rule
that vampirism is a divine curse, and so the symbol of the divinity that cursed
the vampire is what’s relevant. Yet another way to rule this situation would
be that the faith of the wielder of the cross is what’s important, so without
True Faith, no vampire of any sort is going to be repelled. What would not be
a good ruling is to just decide on the spur of the moment that your vampire is
Hindu so as to bypass a character’s inconvenient cross.
Dealing with dice rolls
One of the traps that is easy to fall into as a GM is allowing all actions to be
resolved by straight rolls against various skills. Although this is sometimes
appropriate, not all actions are equally difficult. A person with a skill in
Driving is going to have a harder time speeding through a slalom course with
oil spilled on the ground than she is if the track is clean and dry. In most situ-
ations, you should impose penalties or give bonuses depending on how hard
the proposed action is.
In many cases, an ordinary use of a skill does not necessarily even require a
roll. A character probably does not need to make a Gardening roll just to take
care of her roses. If she’s trying to grow an elaborate and flawless hedge maze
for her rich employer, that is another story! With many skills, it makes sense to
allow a roll if the character wonders how well they did. For example, a charac-
ter cooking dinner for his boss might roll against his Cooking skill to see if his
meal was impressive. The more he makes his skill by, the better the food.
Assigning skill modifiers according to situation is more of an art than a sci-
ence. We recommend starting from what you consider a typical use of the
skill and then giving bonuses or penalties according to how much harder
than this you think the action is. To use the previous example of Driving, 
perhaps a typical situation in which you might require a skill roll is if some-
one tries to change lanes into the driving character, requiring her to act
quickly to get out of the way. If this happens in the driving rain, you could
give the character a –1 penalty. If it happens on an icy road, maybe –3. If the
characters were suspicious of the car trying to run them off the road and
were watching it, maybe a bonus of +2.
219
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

There are a set of guidelines for this in GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns (pages
345-346), although in practice you won’t want to take the time and mull over
it during play. This is the kind of thing you’ll want to get used to assigning off
the top of your head, so as not to interrupt play too much.
Contests of skill
Sometimes in GURPS, characters or NPCs will compete in a skill, and it will
be important to know who does best. For example, a character might enter a
singing competition against a group of NPCs. Also, sometimes two characters
want to compete against each other using just their attributes rather than
skills. For example, they might arm wrestle to determine who is stronger. 
Such competitions can be resolved using Contests.There are two types of
Contests of skill:
 Quick Contests are used primarily for competition between two people
that takes place over a short period. An example might be an Old West–
style gunfight, with the quicker draw shooting the slower one.
To do a Quick Contest, both sides roll against the skill in question (or 
in some cases, against an attribute score). If one side succeeds and the
other fails, the one who succeeded obviously wins. If both succeed, the
one who succeeds by the greatest margin is the winner.
 Regular Contests of skill represent longer contests, such as a tug of war.
These are decided in much the same way as Quick Contests. However,
instead of declaring the person who succeeds by the most to be the
winner, you keep rolling until one side succeeds and the other fails.
The problem with Regular Contests of skill is that they can take a long time to
resolve. The rules suggest that, if both sides have skills of 6 or less, you raise
the lower of the two scores to 10, add the same amount to the higher score,
and use those numbers. For example, if the Contest involves a skill of 4 against
a skill of 6, you would make the 4 into a 10 and the 6 into a 12.
Similarly, scores higher than 14 should be lowered or you’ll be rolling all day.
Again, you adjust the lower score to 10, and the higher score is adjusted by
the same amount as the lower. So a Contest between a 14 and a 20 would
become a Contest between a 10 and a 16.
In our opinion, it’s better to just ignore the Regular Contest rules and use
Quick Contests for everything instead. The drama of watching people roll
dice pales quickly, and the results just aren’t going to be that different.

Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

Creating house rules
House rules are rules used by a gaming group that are not official rules. Few
GMs do everything exactly by the book; in fact, we’ve never met such a GM. A
certain number of house rules are inevitable. Because the rule books cannot
cover every situation, the GM must make up new rules to “fill in the cracks.”
House rules can add flavor to a specific campaign, or they can fix things that
annoy you with the official rules. The important thing is to make sure that
you inform your players of them beforehand!
Here are some examples of house rules from our gaming group, along with
their rationale.
 No learned experience allowed. Allowing characters to improve by
studying requires a lot of tiresome bookkeeping. Furthermore, it gives a
huge advantage to studious characters while punishing players who do
a good job of role playing less-studious characters. Few real-life people
spend every spare moment studying diverse lists of skills.
221
Chapter 14: Playing the GM
Critical successes and failures
In GURPS, a normal success is achieved when
you roll under your skill level, with whatever
modifications are applicable due to the situa-
tion. A critical success (or critical) is an extra-
good result from your skill roll. In general terms,
a roll of 10 under your skill is a critical success,
although a 6 is the highest number you can
score a critical on. That is, a roll of 7 against a
skill of 17 is still not a critical. A roll of 3 or 4 
is always a critical, no matter what your skill
level is.
The chart on p. 556 of GURPS Basic Set: Cam-
paigns tells you the special result you get from
a critical during combat. With most noncombat
skills, it’s up to you as the GM to determine what
happens.
On a critical success, the GM should give the
player an extra-good result. For example, a
painter who makes a critical success roll against
her Artist skill might produce a painting worth
twice as much as her normal paintings.
Keep in mind that a critical success is not nec-
essarily a miracle. Even for a character with a
low skill level, a critical success happens about
2 percent of the time, or 1 time in 50. Someone
with a Jumping skill of 12 is not going to set a
world record just because he rolled a 4.
The flip side of the coin is critical failures. A roll
of an 18 is always a critical failure, and a roll of
a 17 is a critical failure as well if the skill in ques-
tion is 15 or less. A roll of 10 over skill is also a
critical failure.
As with critical successes, critical failures
mean an extra-bad result, but they don’t neces-
sarily mean the end of the world. Someone
rolling a critical failure with the Cooking skill
might burn the pot roast, but she won’t neces-
sarily put her eye out with a fork.

 Healing spells do not incur a penalty for being used on the same person
multiple times a day. This rule generally allows for parties to face every
combat completely healed and eliminates the bookkeeping and health
rolls required for natural healing.
 Calling what you want to see. Sometimes a player wants his character
to do something that calls for the addition of random chance.  For exam-
ple, he might need to prop a door opened so he can shoot approaching
enemies with his hands free. Is there anything that can be used as a door
stop in the room? Using this system as GM, you assign a rough chance of
him getting what he wants. For example, if you think there is about a one
in three chance of a useful doorstop being in the room, you say, “Call
what you want to see, high, medium, or low.” You then roll one die and
put your hand over it. A resulting die roll of one and two is “low,” three
and four is “medium,” and five and six is “high.” If the player calls it cor-
rectly, he finds what he’s looking for. For different probabilities you can
say, “Call what you want to see, high or low,” “Call the number you want
to see,” “ Call what you don’t want to see, high, medium, or low,” or any-
thing else that fits the situation.
 Movement is assumed to happen simultaneously. This is a bit of a 
complicated one. The way that GURPS movement works is easy and
straightforward, but it has a few disadvantages. Because characters
move sequentially, it allows for some strange character interactions. 
The most common issue is that it allows characters to not have to make
up their minds about where they’re going and what they’re doing until
their names are called in combat. If two characters are chasing one foe,
the slower one can wait and see if the faster one has successfully dealt
with the enemy before deciding whether to continue the chase that turn.
Our house movement rule requires everyone to move their characters at
the same time, at the beginning of the turn. If they want to take an action
part way through their move, they tell the GM what their plan is during
the movement phase. This means that characters have to commit to a
plan before they know how the turn is going to develop.
Many house rules are specific to a campaign. Perhaps in some worlds, it is
impossible to have Status without being a member of the priesthood. Or per-
haps Riding is an IQ-based skill because the common mounts are telepathic.
Time management
One of the jobs of the GM is to manage how the action of the game fits into
the time your group has allotted for gaming. As GM, you have to come to the
session prepared with enough things for the characters to do so that you can
fill the time you have to play. It’s also nice to not have to end at an inconve-
nient moment because someone has to go home.
222
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

One of the main things to keep in mind with regard to time management is
that combat in GURPS can take a long time. The amount of time it takes goes
up significantly the more characters there are in the game, the more oppo-
nents they’re fighting, and the higher everyone’s defense scores are. If most
attacks end with a successful dodge, you can be in for a long fight. In some of
our more complicated campaigns, it’s not uncommon for us to have fights
that last five or six hours.
Because of this, it’s usually a good idea not to start any combat sessions
toward the end of the evening’s play. If you interrupt a fight in the middle, it
can be a pain to recreate where everyone was and what condition they were
in later on.
Managing the Flow of Combat
In our experience, the two things that are most likely to slow combat down are
 Players who do not know their character’s abilities well and take time to
figure out how they are going to complete an action.
 GMs who spend lots of time shuffling through page after page of informa-
tion on all the characters who are involved in that particular battle.
Each of these problems is easily dealt with if you’re willing to take the neces-
sary steps.
Kick-starting your players
The best way to deal with players who can’t seem to get their act together
requires you to use your authority as a GM to insist that your players develop
good role playing habits. If you find that your players spend lots of time
dithering about or insisting that they did so have that Potion of Resurrection,
even if it isn’t on their possessions sheet, you may have to develop some fairly
hard-line policies, but you need to be careful that you don’t behave in such a
dictatorial way that your players begin to resent you. You’ll probably need to
come up with your own policies to help the players stay on track. Here are
some typical policies that we have had to institute to get different players off
their behinds and get involved appropriately in combat scenarios:
 The five-minute rule. When his or her name is called in each turn of
action, a player has 5 minutes to decide on and take action. Any player
who fails to do so within the allotted span of time forfeits his action until
the next turn. This may seem harsh, but if you consider that a party 
with six players would then take over 30 minutes to complete one turn
of combat, it doesn’t seem so unreasonable.
223
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

 If it isn’t on your sheet, you don’t have it. We can’t count the number of
times a player has acquired some special item and hasn’t written it down
on her character’s possessions list. This then leads to confusion down the
line when that player “thinks” she has some kind of item that she wants to
use, but she can’t remember its parameters, so she asks the kindly GM to
halt play and look through his notes for something that may have been
acquired in a gaming session that was months — if not years — in the
past. Instituting this simple rule significantly speeds up combat.
 Keep off-topic conversations and external distractions to a minimum.
Yes, the members of your gaming group may all be the best of friends,
but the purpose that brought all of you together for an evening of
gaming was gaming. This isn’t the right time to gossip about your
coworkers or to swap recipes; find some other time to get together for
something like that. To minimize distractions, televisions and radios
should be turned off, and the only reason for a player to be working on a
laptop is if he has his character sheet on the laptop and is taking notes
on the campaign.
 Bribery. Experience-point awards can be partially based upon both
degree of involvement and effectiveness in the campaign. Players who
constantly need to be pushed to keep on task and keep the action
moving can find themselves penalized one or more experience points at
the end of the night.
Creating an electronic combat grid
The biggest problem most GMs have with maintaining the flow during combat
is the lack of adequate organization. Players can get bogged down in all the
details of running each character and spend too much time trying to find
information than actually running combat. One way GMs can speed up a
battle is to develop a system to keep control of the flow of information about
all the player characters and all of the NPCs simultaneously through the cre-
ation of a combat grid. This is where computers (especially laptops) come in
particularly handy. We recommend that you create a combat grid by using a
spreadsheet program that helps you keep track of everything that you need
during the height of battle. Figure 14-1 shows you a combat grid from one of
Bjoern’s campaigns, created using Microsoft Excel. If you look closely, you’ll
notice that several columns (C, G, O, and Q through AA) are hidden because
you don’t need them most of the time during play. (To hide columns, select
the columns and choose Format➪Column➪Hide.) Also note the called-out
comments — we use these to track details that we don’t need to have visible
most of the time but need to have readily available.
224
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

The primary elements that you need to record on your combat grid are
 Basic Speed
 Move
 Total and current Fatigue Points
 Total and current Hit Points
 Damage Resistance
 All active defense rolls (Block, Dodge, and Parry)
 Weapon skill levels
These items aren’t the only pieces of information you need on the combat
grid, they are just those items that you need pretty much for every character
for every turn of combat. Beyond this, you need the secondary information.
You don’t want to put this information in columns like the primary informa-
tion, that would make your tables way too large and unwieldy. As in the figure,
we recommend that you either use the “Comments” feature of the spread-
sheet to insert the information into fields that pop up when you hover your
mouse over the appropriate cell, or you can put this information into regular
cells and then hide the columns so that they don’t take up space. The sec-
ondary elements that you should probably include on the combat grid are:
 Character attributes
 Advantages and disadvantages
Figure 14-1:
The combat
grid for
Bjoern’s
Avonlea
campaign.
225
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

 Damage Resistance by hit location (if you use hit location in combat)
 The details of all active defenses (for example, Shield skill for blocking
and which weapon skill is best used for parrying)
 Details about each character’s weapons, such as type and amount of
damage, rate of fire and range for missiles, and so forth
 The skills, spells, or powers that the character is most likely to use in
combat
You certainly don’t have to use a spreadsheet — or even a computer — to
create a combat grid, but we’ve found that the spreadsheet applications are
the best method for packing the most information into the smallest space
possible. If you also use the same spreadsheet for character sheets for all
your NPCs and player characters (as we did in Figure 14-2; if you look along
the bottom edge, you’ll notice tabs for the PCs in the campaign — the tabs
for the NPCs aren’t visible in that figure), you can write formulas that will
automatically transfer and update the data on the combat grid any time you
change that information on the character sheet.
Creating a battle log
A battle log is a table you can create to keep track of all of the combatants’
actions during a melee and for tracking Basic Speed, Fatigue Point and Hit
Point loss, and equipment usage of all characters. You can create a battle 
log as another worksheet in the same spreadsheet as the combat grid or as
another document altogether. Or, if you’re not interested in using a computer
during play, you can create a table on paper to do the same thing — but it is
not as quick or efficient as a computer application.
How is a battle log different from a combat grid? A combat grid has all of the
relevant information you’re likely to need about the combatants, while a battle
log records the progress of the battle on a turn-by-turn basis. Figure 14-2 shows
you a battle log from Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign.
As you can see, the first 7 columns are identical between this figure and the
combat grid in Figure 14-1. (The worksheet was specifically designed for this.)
These are the items that we have found that we must have for every character
in every combat. We then select cell K2 and use the Window➪Freeze Panes
command so that everything to the left and above that point is always on
screen when this worksheet is active. This allows us to scroll to the right (or
down) for the battle log, and you won’t have to enter any data onto a separate
sheet. Just be sure that you keep the entries for the PCs on this sheet between
combat sessions.
226
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

In the sample battle log, we designate seven columns for each turn of
combat, as follows: 
 One column that you mark for each character when they’ve taken an
action
 One to track (by row number) the foe or foes that each character is
fighting
 One to record lost Fatigue Points
 One to record lost Hit Points
 One to track the use of ammunition (including arrows, sling bullets, and
power cells)
 One to record the use of any other expendable items
 One last column for general notes
This allows you to track exactly when each event occurs — especially those
situations for which you have to count turns, such as if a character is stunned,
concentrating on a spell, or taking damage on a turn-by-turn basis. You don’t
need to record every action in combat; you simply need to record actions
whose results you may have to track later.
Combat sequencing and initiative
Keeping track of who goes when during combat is one of the most strenuous
tasks of any GM. Few things cause even the most mild-mannered player to
lose his cool like having his action skipped over during combat — although
the players rarely complain if the GM skips over one of the foe’s turns. Like
most things with GURPS, keeping track of Basic Speed is not really that diffi-
cult with a good battle log.

227
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

Using the standard GURPS rules, a character’s Basic Speed is [HT + DX] / 4.
Unless the battle is a surprise situation, combat sequencing is a simple matter
of calling characters in descending order of their Basic Speed. In the battle
log in Figure 14-2, the Basic Speed for each character is listed in column B.
The rows are then sorted in descending order by Basic Speed (done automat-
ically by using the spreadsheet’s Sort command) so that the GM simply needs
to go down the list of combatants, calling each character in sequence and
inserting a “XX” for each character’s row in the column of the current turn
when each character’s action is completed.
Tracking injury, fatigue, and equipment usage
The battle log is the best tool we know of to keep track of the consequences
of combat. In the sample battle log shown in Figure 14-2, four out of seven
columns that we’ve dedicated for each turn of combat exist precisely to keep
track of this information.
Now, you could simply have a single column that you use to track this sort 
of thing and record expended Fatigue Points, lost Hit Points, and used or
destroyed equipment all in the same place — and if you’re still using the
paper-and-pen method of keeping a battle log, we still recommend doing it
that way. But if you do use a computer while you are GMing, we highly recom-
mend that you take advantage of the ability of spreadsheet programs to auto-
matically do the calculations for you.
The system works the same way for tracking Hit Points, Fatigue Points, or any
one kind of ammunition per cell, and we’ll be using Hit Point loss to demon-
strate how it works for any category. Figure 14-3 shows how we set up the
spreadsheet to track lost Hit Points.
If you want to use this system, set it up when you are entering the informa-
tion for the first character in the battle log and combat grid. After you get it
set up for the first character, you can use the Copy and Paste commands to
enter the formulas for every other character, whether PC or NPC.

levels.
228
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

To create the formula to track current Hit Points, follow these steps:
1. Create all the column headings for your combat grid and battle log.
This includes the battle log columns for at least 10 turns of combat (we
suggest 15 or 20).
2. Enter the information for the first character you’re including in the
battle log.
3. Click the cell where you want current Hit Points to be displayed.
If you use our column organization, this would be cell I2, the first row
under the column heading “Current HP.”
4. Enter an equal sign (=) and then click the cell that has character’s base
Hit Points.
5. Enter a plus sign (+) and then click the “HP Dam” cell for the first turn
of the battle grid (cell AH2 in figure 14-3).
6. Repeat step #5 to include each “HP Dam” cell for that row and  then
type ) after the cell range.
7. Press Enter.
8. Click again on the “Current HP” cell and, with your cursor, grab the +
in the lower-right corner of the cell and drag the information down
the column for at least 30 rows.
Your formula is now set up for all the characters you enter into the combat
grid.
Then, when you are running combat and a character has taken an injury,
click the “HP Dam” cell for the current turn of combat and enter the injury
the character has taken, using a minus sign (–) to make it a negative number.
If the character receives healing, enter the amount of HP healed as a positive
number.
Whenever you’re adding the records of new characters to your combat grid
or battle log, you can insert the relevant formulas into the new records simply
by using the Copy and Paste commands in the appropriate cells from another
character’s information. Most spreadsheet programs are smart enough to
update the cell addresses in the formulas to use the same row.
After combat is over, you can go ahead and delete the rows of the NPCs who
had been in the battle. Be careful that you don’t delete the rows that contain
the information about player characters — if you do, you’ll have to re-enter
all the data you had so carefully entered before. Also, we do not recommend
that you delete the columns in the battle log; if you delete a cell that is
229
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

included in the formula used in another area, that cell address is removed
from the formula. You can’t Copy and Paste columns and have the formula
references copy over to the new columns like you can with the rows of a
spreadsheet.
Using the tactical map
Playing GURPS is a lot easier and a lot more fun — especially the combat
part — if you can create a visual representation of the action. This is most
commonly done through the use of a tactical map (or hex map) and miniature
figures. The tactical map is typically a vinyl sheet with a uniform hex grid
printed on its surface (you can also purchase and use maps with square grids,
but GURPS is designed with a hex-grid system in mind, so we recommend
you stay with that). If you can’t find the product in vinyl, you can also some-
times purchase (or make) oversized sheets of paper with the hex grid copied
onto it. The advantage of the vinyl sheets is that they are reuseable — you
can use dry erase markers and water-soluble nonpermanent markers to draw
the terrain or floor plan of your current scenario and then simply erase your
marks when you’re done.
Painful experience has taught us two things about using the vinyl tactical
maps: 1) Don’t use red markers on them (the marks don’t come completely
out), and 2) always clean your maps at the end of each gaming session. If you
allow even the “nonpermanent” markers to stay on the vinyl for very long,
your marks won’t come all the way out.
Tactical grids come in a number of different scales; we recommend that you
use a scale in which each hex is one inch (2.54 centimeters) across. If you go
larger, your maps will take up more space than you need, and if you go smaller,
you will have difficulty with your figures crowding each other. The one-inch-
per-hex scale is nice because it simplifies the math, too; remember that the
default scale for each hex in your game world is one yard. With the 1 inch = 
1 hex = 1 yard scale, you can easily use a ruler to draw (for example) a 9-inch
line to represent a 9-yard-long wall.
You have a number of options for figures representing both the player charac-
ters and the NPCs. Lead figures are specifically produced for role playing
games, but these are expensive, heavy, easily damaged, and need to be painted
to look decent. You can also simply use six-sided dice, or even squares of paper
with names written on them, but that’s pretty boring. We recommend that you
use Cardboard Heroes, produced by Steve Jackson Games. They’re lightweight,
inexpensive, durable (we’ve been using the same set for over 10 years), and
don’t need any preparation other than being cut out and folded before they can
be used.
230
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

SJ Games also sells little plastic bases that you can fit the Cardboard Heroes
onto. We recommend that you invest in more than a few of these as well. If
you don’t have them (or don’t have enough), you can keep your figures
standing upright by taping a penny to the bottom of the figure.
One of the problems a lot of GMs face during combat is keeping track of which
figure represents which NPC. The nice thing about the plastic bases that you
can buy for the Cardboard Heroes is that you can write on them with a tempo-
rary marker to indicate which NPC each figure represents. Trust us, it makes
things go much more smoothly.
Figure 14-4 shows you what a tactical map with Cardboard Heroes figures looks
like. Notice that the base of the ant figure has a hand-written code to represent
which Giant Ant the party is currently fighting.
Managing movement
How far a particular character can move during combat is one of the most
abused elements of combat in GURPS. As the GM, you need to keep track of
what each character can accomplish in a turn of combat, and the tactical
map is the best tool at your disposal for keeping the abuses to a minimum.
The fourth-edition rules give each character a number of movement points
based on his Move score in the combat environment (usually one of ground,
air, or water). How far a character can actually move depends upon how
Figure 14-4:
The tactical
map clearly
shows 
the danger
faced by our
fearless
adventurers. 
231
Chapter 14: Playing the GM

much weight he’s carrying (his encumbrance), terrain, obstacles, and many
other factors. Some simple rules that apply well for 90 percent of all charac-
ters are
 On land, a character gets a number of movement points equal to his
Ground Move — or simply Move — which equals his Basic Move modi-
fied downward for encumbrance.
 If he is flying, he gets a number of movement points equal to his Air Move,
which usually equals twice his Basic Speed rounded off and modified
downward for encumbrance.
 If he is swimming, he gets a number of movement points equal to his
Water Move, which is 1⁄5 his Basic Move, rounded off, unless he is Aquatic
or Amphibious, in which case it equals his Basic Move. Once again,
modify this for encumbrance.
The new rules in GURPS fourth edition assess some costs to movement points’
economy. In general, a character can use one movement point to move one hex
in a straight line during a turn; changing facing, turning, moving over uneven or
difficult terrain, and other such impediments all increase the number of move-
ment points it takes to cross a single hex.
When you’re arguing with your players about how and where their characters
can move during combat, we suggest that you use a tactical map and pay
close attention to its details in order to make your decisions. Using the hex
grid system allows you to quickly determine exactly what a character with a
given Move score can accomplish in a single turn and can allow you to graph-
ically illustrate the layout of the combat scenario, including any obstacles,
barriers, areas of cover, and routes of escape.

Building a Simple Adventure
In This Chapter
 Creating a world setting
 Stealing ideas from books, movies, and history
 Choosing a power level
 Writing the evening’s adventure
S
o you’ve rounded up a group of players with ideas for characters, and
now you want to play! What should you do next? What type of adventure
will you create for your players? How can you be sure your goals and plot
ideas will translate into enjoyable play?
Have no fear. This chapter deals with the ins and outs of making a simple
adventure to be played out in a session or two. For guidance on a more elabo-
rate campaign with a unique world and society, see Part V.
Covering the Basics
The first thing you need to start a game is a game setting, a place for your
characters to do things. You don’t need to work out an elaborate world full of
political intrigue and unique new laws of physics if you’re just planning to run
a few sessions. However, you do have to outline the basics because they will
be integral to what goes on in the campaign.
Brainstorming
Usually, when you create a simple adventure (or a complex one for that
matter), you start with some kind of milieu in mind. Will it be a sword-and-
sorcery adventure, complete with elves and dwarves and beautiful maidens
captured by local dragons? Will the action take place in a domed city on an

asteroid where miners are trying to repel an alien invasion fleet? Will the
characters be beset by mutants in a post-apocalyptic Earth setting? After you
decide on the basic setting, you’re halfway to an adventure.
But where do you get inspiration?
Stealing from books and movies
The local library is a treasure trove of ideas for adventures. Even if you don’t
want to crib directly from the world described in a particular book, you can
borrow parts here and there or use ideas as a jumping-off point for your own
imagination. For example, you might want to run a Star Wars campaign, com-
plete with the entire cast of characters. Or perhaps you want to use the Star
Wars universe but not the specifics — you’d prefer the action in your game to
take place far away from the action of the movies. Or, on the other hand,
maybe you just want to use Star Wars as a model for your own game world —
a futuristic campaign involving an elite group of Jedi-like priest-warriors.
You can also take bits and pieces from various books that strike your fancy
and combine them into one whole. In his Avonlea campaign, Bjoern drew lib-
erally from Marion Zimmer Bradley’s Darkover, Andre Norton’s Witch World,
Margaret Weis’s Star of the Guardians, Star Wars, and the Heralds of Valdemar
series by Mercedes Lackey. He used The Darkover Concordance liberally for
all personal names and much of the etiquette and ethical information.
Perhaps you decide that the Jedi-like priest-warriors have become the wicked
ruling class and are opposed by a secret society of wizards modeled loosely
on the Harry Potter books. All sorts of possibilities exist if you put things
together in creative ways.
Reworking classic themes
Sometimes it can be good to stick with ideas that have worked for many in
the past. A straight sword-and-sorcery campaign set in a medieval-Europe-
like setting or a post-apocalyptic struggling-to-rebuild-society plot may not
seem original, but they’re tried and true and will seem familiar to everyone,
which can be a good thing. If you aren’t planning on having a special world
setting, you can save a lot of time by sticking with tradition.
This option can work well when combined with other options. The basic cam-
paign theme might be fairly standard, but you might be inspired by a book or
movie for the actual plot, for example.
Borrowing from history
You can get some good adventures by lifting settings straight out of history
books. The action can take place in ancient Rome, Carthage, or Napoleonic
France. The only real issue to watch for here is to make sure you don’t have
players who know a lot more about the time period than you do, or there will
234
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

be a lot of arguments. You can get around this problem simply by stating that
your world is an alternate world, and none of the players can count on any-
thing that they know about a particular historical period being true for your
world.
These campaigns can easily work into an “alternate history” type of story as
well. You can explore what you think would have happened if Hitler had won
World War II, to take the most common example.
Asking yourself “What if . . .”
One way to create unique world settings is to pose yourself a question and
then let your imagination run with it. For example, say you turn on your TV
and see the news discussing a hurricane that is forming in the Pacific. Make
up some “what if” questions about the situation. What if something happened
so that the entire surface of the world was covered with hurricanes all the
time? How would people live? Perhaps in little underground enclaves?
Perhaps their mail delivery is now in the hands of a heroic clan of adventur-
ers who risk their lives dodging between enclaves when weather permits,
keeping people in contact with each other.
Or perhaps hurricanes are generated by particularly powerful air elementals.
Maybe humanity has to walk a very fine line to keep from annoying the forces
of nature and causing them to wreak mighty vengeance on them.
Buying premade adventures
If you want to GM, but you really don’t have the time to create your own
adventure — let alone a campaign — you can buy premade adventures.
Because GURPS Fourth Edition is still fairly new, there won’t be a lot of fourth-
edition adventures readily available. Don’t let this stop you. Converting a
third-edition adventure is pretty easy, especially considering that the fourth
edition doesn’t require you to keep track of how many character points your
NPCs are worth.
Steve Jackson Games has a Web site called e23, which allows you to purchase
GURPS materials for download. The address is http://e23.sjgames.com.
You can find a few third-edition premade adventures there and also download
some handy reference material for free! There is a free download on this site
called GURPS Update that will help you convert third-edition characters to
the fourth edition.
With only a little more effort, you can modify premade adventures from other
gaming systems. You just have to assign appropriate statistics to any mon-
sters or NPCs from the other gaming system. There aren’t rules for this; you
can do it off the top of your head. Because you are the GM, there is no need
for painstaking point-balancing; points are for player characters, not GMs.
235
Chapter 15: Building a Simple Adventure

Setting goals
After you’ve got a good world setting for your adventure, you need to figure
out what you want your party’s goal to be. If you’ve chosen a classic sword-
and-sorcery adventure, perhaps they’re out to save a princess or slay a
dragon. Or maybe they’re out to infiltrate the palace of the evil Overlord of
Seven Worlds and steal the secret of his mind-control machine. Or perhaps
they’re merely going to be looting some ancient ruins. Identifying the goal of
the adventure is the first step in figuring out what the action of the adventure
is going to be and what you need to know before you can run it.
One style of game that can work very well if you have the right players is to
let the characters decide on the goals. For example, you might have a game in
which the entire party is made up of thieves of one sort or another and allow
them to plan elaborate crimes. Such a game requires a flexible GM who is
willing to improvise because you’re probably going to have to make up a cer-
tain amount of stuff as you go along. However, such games have the advan-
tage of taking less time to prepare for.
Having fun stuff for your players to do
Because the goal you set for your party represents the end of the adventure,
you have to make sure that goal is either complicated enough to require a lot
of effort to solve, or is supported by other complications along the path to
solving it. If the party is hired to save young prince Hubart from the evil
clutches of the Ogre of Castle Blarg, you have to figure out a way to prevent
the whole adventure from being endless episodes of the party chopping the
ogre to bits. Perhaps finding Castle Blarg is an adventure unto itself. Perhaps
the Ogre of Castle Blarg can be killed only by a certain artifact that the char-
acters have to locate first. Or maybe Castle Blarg is a huge and rambling edi-
fice full of guardian monsters, and navigating it turns the whole adventure
into a dungeon crawl.
The main point of any game is to have fun. However, this requires more
thought than just mechanically planning a certain number of fights, and so
on. Different players have different things they like, but in general, role play-
ing game aficionados like some or all of the following elements in a given
adventure:
 Role playing: One of the obvious attractions of role playing games is
that you get to play the role of someone different from yourself. It there-
fore stands to reason that you should try to include some situations in
your adventure that allow players to flex their personalities a bit.
In our adventures, we usually try to provide the characters some
amount of non-combat interaction with NPCs. This gives the characters
236
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

a chance to talk, argue, persuade, and engage in diplomacy. But allowing
characters to use their personalities goes beyond that. You also should
give characters with the Curious disadvantage a chance to snoop, char-
acters with Charitable a chance to do charity, and so forth.
 Problem solving: Most people enjoy the thrill of thinking their way
through problems. Whether it’s planning the perfect crime or deciding
how to stop criminals, victories are a lot sweeter if you’ve had to put
some thought into them, rather than just rolling a bunch of dice.
When we add problem-solving to our adventures, we prefer a flexible
approach. If you set up a situation with a preconceived “correct” way of
solving the problem, 9 times out of 10 your players will think of some
other way of approaching it. If you just accept that this is going to
happen a lot, you can save yourself a lot of heartbreak and hard work.
Rather than fixate on the details of things you think they ought to be
thinking about, go for a lot of general details and be ready to ad-lib the
fine points of whatever they end up deciding to do.
 Exploring: If you are able to make your world seem real enough to your
party, they’ll get a fair degree of satisfaction by just exploring it. You can
greatly increase their interest if there are a few rewards worked into the
exploration. Perhaps they find an abandoned fort that they can convert
into a base of operations, or a shop that sometimes sells a few useful
and unusual items.
 Developing characters’ personalities: Although some role players just
want their characters to be killing machines, many like to role play
social situations, establish friendships and relationships with NPCs, and
so on. Giving them a chance to do so builds their connection with your
campaign. If the party spends the evening making friends in the tavern,
the next day, when the goblin hordes attack, they will be that much
more emotionally invested in defending the town.
Adjusting the Level of Might 
of Your Campaign
Besides the starting character point level for the campaign, the main thing
that influences the power level of your campaign is what kinds of powers, 
abilities, and magic are available. A party that can fly, read minds, and brew
alchemical potions has a lot more options in solving the problems you pre-
sent (and thwarting your plans) than a party made up of totally mundane
characters with high attributes and skills, even if the supernatural party has
a lower point level. We strongly recommend that you go over all the specific
abilities that you’re allowing in your campaign before you make them available,
rather than simply making blanket statements such as “psionics are allowed.”
237
Chapter 15: Building a Simple Adventure

If this statement makes us sound anti-powers, we most certainly are not.
Most people play fantasy role playing games because they want to pretend to
be someone more than human. Special abilities can add a lot to the game. To
a certain extent, the involvement of such abilities in the game can make life
easier for the GM; a party that can do many things can meet a wider variety
of challenges, which means the GM is less limited. We do think, though, that
deciding what abilities to include in a campaign requires a bit of thought
beforehand. We like to think about abilities in several different categories,
such as the following:
 Healing abilities: In a campaign with a fair amount of fighting in it, char-
acters are going to spend a certain amount of time being injured. If you
allow a good selection of healing abilities in the campaign, it is likely that
the party will never have to go into a fight already nursing wounds.
There are two ways to look at this category. On the one hand, having to
worry about party damage can be an interesting strategic problem for a
party. It adds another dimension to all the things they have to think
about and keeps the players on their toes a little bit.
On the other hand, healing is an ability that is very difficult to abuse.
Allowing healing such that the party always faces each challenge with
full Hit Points doesn’t particularly unbalance the game, and such parties
are not particularly difficult to GM. In fact, a party with ready access to
healing is probably a bit easier to GM because you can gauge each fight
you prepare with the assumption that the party will come into it at full
Hit Points. Whether you allow much in the way of healing abilities is
pretty much just a matter of taste.
 Combat abilities: Both offensive and defensive combat abilities can be
unbalancing in a campaign. The main problem comes when the individ-
ual characters end up with a wide range of damage resistances and
offensive capabilities. If one character is DR 30 and the rest are DR 2, it’s
difficult to plan combats in which your foes can injure the first character
without obliterating everyone else. You’ll have a similar problem if one
character is dispensing 10d damage and everyone else is running
around with daggers.
Advantages such as Insubstantiality and Invisibility can also have a huge
effect on combat, and you ought to allow them only if you know how
you’re going to deal with them during play.
 Detection abilities: By detection abilities, we mean anything that helps
your character gather information. We include things like enhanced
senses, the ability to detect magic, or even the ability to read minds.
Whether or not detection abilities are likely to unbalance your campaign
depends in large part on what sort of campaign you’re running. In many
cases, those abilities can make it easier for you to distribute information
to the players. However, in a campaign where the goal is to uncover
238
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

hidden information, you have to be careful not to allow characters to
short circuit your plot. If a character has Mind Probe with enough
enhancements, she might wind up reading your villain’s mind from miles
away completely undetectably.
 Movement abilities: Movement abilities (such as Enhanced Move, Flight,
and Warp) can limit how you challenge your party, especially when it
comes to breaking into places your enemies don’t want them to be. A
flying character is not hindered by castle walls and will often break into
a house through a third-floor window. Additionally, warping characters
or characters with the Teleport spell may be able to circumvent a lot of
your defenses if you aren’t prepared. If you allow these powers, try to
make up ways to counteract them so they won’t destroy your plot.
 Other: Besides these larger categories, there are many other abilities
that are less easy to categorize. Be sure to spend some time thinking of
the various ways each ability can be used before you allow it, to avoid
nasty surprises later on.
239
Chapter 15: Building a Simple Adventure
How many points?
One of the challenges of GMing is figuring out
how many points you should allow players to
build their characters with in your campaign.
There is no hard and fast rule on how to do this.
If you choose too low of a starting point level,
you may have a difficult time adapting your
adventure so that it’s easy enough for the party
to handle. If you choose too high of a level, you
may have a tough time challenging them.
On page 487 of GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns,
you are given advice about how starting points
equate to relative levels of power. We don’t
have any particular quarrel with this list, but
keep in mind that an average person (who the
GURPS rules rate at 25–50 points) makes a
below-average adventurer. If you want your
party to be capable of even minor heroic deeds,
they should probably be at least in the 100- to
125-point range.
If you’re used to third-edition rules, fourth-edi-
tion characters tend to be more costly. The point
levels you are used to are going to seem a bit
less powerful in the fourth edition. This is pri-
marily because DX and IQ are more expensive
at the lower levels and because you can no
longer put half a point into skills.
You should also keep in mind that a lot depends
on how many disadvantages you allow charac-
ters to take. A 50-point character with –100
points in disadvantages will have more Achilles’
heels than a 50-point character with only –40
points in disadvantages, but they will also have
gotten 60 more points to spend on powerful abil-
ities. Our advice is to read the list as if you were
assuming a –40 point limit to disadvantages, and
if you’re going to allow more disadvantages than
that, assume the characters will function at a
higher level of power than the guide in the book.
Overall, err slightly on the side of giving out too
few points rather than too many. Because
points are awarded after each night of play,
characters grow more powerful over time, but
if you start them off too powerful, you’re pretty
much stuck with it.

Providing Starting Information
When you’ve got an idea of what the characters in your campaign are going
to be doing, you want to provide a basic write-up of the world to your players
to aid them in character creation. For a simple adventure or two, you don’t
need to go all-out, but you should provide the following information:
 Technology level: Does the action take place in a medieval setting? The
present? The future? Perhaps the biological sciences have advanced
tremendously, but the mechanical sciences lag far behind. In any case,
your party will need to know whether they should buy bows and swords
or lasers and force shields.
 Supernatural and supernormal abilities and powers: Are there wizards
and priests with magical powers? Are psionics available? Do martial
artists have mystical knowledge beyond mortal ken? Will the party be
comic-book superheroes? If there are any powers available, you’ll need
to give your players information about them.
 Races: What races are available? Can your players choose to be goblins
or centaurs? Or little green men from Mars?
 Setting: You should provide a paragraph or two about the setting of the
campaign. Is it a large futuristic metropolis? A domed city on an aster-
oid? A merfolk village at the bottom of the sea?
 Character templates: If you have any character templates for the cam-
paign, you’ll want to include the basic world information. Templates are
good for all players. Newbies can use them as-is, and veterans can
review them for an idea of what you consider acceptable.
 Cultural and social information: For a quick and simple adventure, the
social aspect of the game may be insignificant. However, be sure to
240
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 
Naming your NPCs
One of the nasty habits many players have is
deciding to interrogate various NPCs you didn’t
bother to write up, forcing you to make up these
NPCs’ characteristics on the fly. They often will
ask for their names. “Maybe the stable boy saw
something,” they will say, and pretty soon they’ll
be putting him on their Christmas card lists.
Rather than fumble for a good name, you can
just tell the players that it’s not important, but
that gives away that you weren’t planning for
them to get useful information from that NPC.
It’s a good idea to go into each night’s session
with a list of 8 or 10 names of both genders. That
way, you can just glance at the list and read the
last unused one. If your campaign uses normal
Earth names, a baby-name book can be a valu-
able resource.

include any social information that is important. What languages do
people speak? How important is wealth and status? What are the local
religions?
 Limitations: How many points will the players be allowed to make char-
acters out of? Is there a limit on the number of disadvantages? Are any
advantages or disadvantages mandatory or off-limits?
Preparing for the Session
So now you have a basic world setting worked out, an idea for what you want
your adventure to be about, and a cast of characters. Now it’s time to get
down to the nuts and bolts of planning out a gaming session. An evening’s
adventure is a microcosm of a campaign; you should go into it with a goal for
the party to aim for for the session (although they may not actually complete
it in one session).
It is common to begin a campaign with an “opening scene” in which the party
members meet each other and officially become involved in whatever prob-
lem they will be set to solving in the game. You can certainly do this with a
quick adventure as well, although in some cases you might want to dispense
with it and just tell your players to assume their characters already knew each
other. If you are just running an individual adventure for the night, you may
not want to spend a lot of time on the characters getting to know each other.
Writing the adventure
If you are just running a simple adventure, one that takes only a few sessions
of play, there is no need to create an elaborate write-up of the world the
action takes place in. However, you are still going to need to create some
fairly specific details about the people, places, and things your party will be
interacting with. Also, in many cases, a little background detail can save you
creative energy in the long run. If you’ve already decided that the town the
characters start in is run by a corrupt crime syndicate, and the mayor is just
a puppet, it makes your decisions a lot easier when deciding things like
whether or not the police will take bribes or how difficult it is to find a local
black market.
A good way to start is to write a quick outline of the story you’re planning.
This is just for you, not for sharing with the players. An outline would go
something like this: “Anna Connor’s sister is kidnapped by the Dark Priests of
Sett. They plan to sacrifice her on the night of the new moon. She is being
kept in the basement of an abandoned warehouse down by the pier, in which
an elaborate temple has been constructed.”
241
Chapter 15: Building a Simple Adventure

From this outline, you can easily see the basics you need to create. You’re
going to need at least a rough sketch of the Dark Priests of Sett, so that Anna
and her friends can fight with them. Do they have special powers or special
resistances? What sort of weapons do they have? It is not necessary to write
all of these foes up as if they were characters, and it would be overly time-
consuming to do so. However, you need to know enough about them so that
they can do whatever you plan for them to do in the adventure, be it to fight,
give information, plant hypnotic suggestions in the back of the heroes’ minds,
or what have you.
You are also going to need a map of the Dark Priests’ temple and to figure out
where in it Anna’s sister is and what other hazards await there. A rough
sketch will do, but you want to make sure you have all the rooms and their
approximate sizes jotted down, where the doors are, the location of any
traps, and so on. You’ll find it helpful to label each room with a number and
make a numbered key as to what is in each room following the map.
Just as it is possible to buy premade adventures, it is also possible to buy
premade maps. Maps of castles, temples, towns, and houses are available for
a number of different gaming systems but can be used for any system. Little
to no conversion is necessary because you’re mostly just concerned with
where the doors are and what shape the rooms are. Check out your local
gaming store to see what they have.
Many maps are also available on the Internet. Try a Google image search and
you may just find what you need for free.
Now you fill in the less obvious parts. Anna and her allies are going to want
to go looking for Anna’s sister, so you need to make it possible for them to
find her. That means that you need to figure out what clues to leave and per-
haps create some NPCs who know things they can tell the party.
Generating enough material
One thing you have to worry about with a single adventure that you don’t
have to think about in a whole campaign is making sure you have enough
material to keep the players busy for however long you plan to be playing
that day.
It is actually fairly easy to guesstimate how long a combat will take. It will
vary somewhat depending on the number of characters, the number of ene-
mies, the level of power of the campaign, and how brisk you are as GM at
keeping things moving along. But after you’ve run a couple combats, you can
count on future battles unfolding at approximately the same rate. The party
will also tend to explore unknown areas at a fairly consistent rate.
242
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

More difficult are the sections of the campaign in which the party is sup-
posed to be gathering clues, having social interactions, or planning some-
thing sneaky. These things can either go very quickly or take up the whole
session, depending on how your players’ brains are functioning that night.
There isn’t a good way to make these situations more predictable, but it can
be a good idea to make your adventure a bit flexible, so you can take things
out or leave them in depending on how much time your party is taking.
Perhaps in your write-up, two different people might have pieces of informa-
tion the party needs. During the actual game, you might give both pieces of
information to whatever person the party finds first if you feel they aren’t
moving as quickly as you’d like.
Avoiding being caught by surprise
One of the challenges of GMing is trying to figure out what your players are
going to be doing in the gaming session, so you can figure out the necessary
information. If you are willing to lead your players through the action by the
nose, you can be pretty sure of what they’re going to be doing, and therefore
be sure what you need to write up. The more autonomy you allow your play-
ers, the more flexible you’re going to have to be.
Players have a nasty habit of wanting to go off on tangents you hadn’t consid-
ered or trying to get information from sources that you didn’t think they
would check. There are several things you can do about that:
 Make them trip over a clue. If your party is on the verge of going off on
a wild goose chase, you can sometimes drop a clue to what they’re sup-
posed to be doing right in their laps. This usually takes some improvisa-
tion on your part. Subtlety can be good, but it isn’t always necessary
with this kind of thing. Something dramatic, like an NPC staggering into
the room with a knife in the back and coughing out a clue with his or her
dying breath will always grab the party’s attention.
 Keep a store of NPCs and maps for all occasions. Sometimes you want
to just let the party go on their wild goose chase. There isn’t any particu-
lar reason to expect the party to be on track at all times. The problem
comes when their side trip is into a situation that you have not created
the details for. It’s possible to head this problem off at least partially by
keeping a few extra NPCs in a folder so you can pull them out as needed.
You can also make up a few simple building maps in case the party feels
the need to explore (for example) an abandoned warehouse that has
nothing to do with anything you have planned.
243
Chapter 15: Building a Simple Adventure

In an emergency, if you are a really nice GM (which we generally discour-
age), you can move the underground Temple of Sett from its original
location into that stupid warehouse and keep the adventure on track.
 Be prepared to wing it. Sometimes your players’ scheme will make
more sense than what you had planned for them to do. In general, we
think it’s fair to reward the players for their cleverness by letting them
get away with more than you intended. However, if their clever plot
threatens to short-circuit the adventure, you should make something up
to short-circuit it. Try to be as subtle as you can, and hopefully they
won’t notice.
Making sure your players’ characters 
don’t die on their first outing
One of the many arts of GMing is being able to scare the heck out of your
players without actually doing their characters in. Even if your GM philoso-
phy includes the idea that characters must occasionally die, you don’t want it
to happen all the time. Players will not become emotionally attached to their
characters if they keep going away.
The more you get to know the characters in your campaign, the more you’ll
know what to expect out of them. On the characters’ first outing, however, it
can be a bit tougher to know what they’re capable of.
One thing you can do to help yourself out is make a list of the characters’
combat capabilities. This list should include all the characters’ defenses, dam-
ages, and abilities that are useful in combat. Include abilities like Invisibility
and Flight, which are not only useful in combat but can help a character stay
out of sight or out of reach. Take extra special note of area-effect abilities that
can attack multiple foes or that are difficult or impossible to dodge (you can
dodge an area-effect ability only if you’re near enough to the edge to jump out
of it). This list can help you plan out opponents, both so they can be the right
level of power, and so you can make sure that the party is challenged.
One easy way to scare your party is by attacking them with a large party of
weaker (but not obviously weaker) foes. If the party looks seriously outnum-
bered, it’s going to cause them some concern. If you do this, you should make
sure the foes’ defense isn’t too high, otherwise the combination of their sheer
number of attacks combined with their ability to defend means they’ll likely
wipe the party out.

Chapter 16
Motivating Players
In This Chapter
 Campaigning from the players’ perspective
 Keeping your players happy
 Working characters into the campaign
G
URPS is a game, and like all games the point of it is to have fun. Unlike
most games, the duties for keeping it fun are not evenly distributed.
Because the GM creates the world that the players play in, and adjudicates
all the action in it, it is the duty of the GM is to keep the players interested
and motivated. Bored players ring the death knell of any campaign! In this
chapter, we examine some of the factors that keep players interested and on
their toes.
Understanding Your Players
In order to get the most out of your campaign, you must understand your
players. What exactly are they looking for in the gaming experience? Do they
just like a little simulated mayhem, or are they looking for deep involvement
in a complex story line?
It’s easier to understand what your players want after a few sessions of
gaming, but you can tell a fair amount from how they create their characters.
How much do they seem to be interested in social advantages and disadvan-
tages? Did they bother to pay points for things like Appearance, Status, or
Charisma? Did they take disadvantages such as Lecherousness that require
social interaction to come into play? Taking advantages and disadvantages
that affect a character’s social interactions indicates that the player is inter-
ested in interacting often with NPCs.
Talking to your players during character creation is also a good plan. Feel
free to ask if the reason a character seems 100 percent geared to combat is
because that’s what the player prefers doing or if that’s what the player
expects the campaign to be about.

How you mix your players’ preferences with your GMing style is a matter of
give and take. The truth is that if you attempt to GM far outside of your comfort
zone because it’s what you think your players expect, you’re probably not
going to have any fun, and neither will your players. However, you can use your
knowledge of what the players want to make small adjustments to accommo-
date your players, and that will be good for everyone. If a player is interested
only in combat and doesn’t enjoy talking, plan to leave the talking to someone
else and maybe work in a few more fights than you would usually include.
Lastly, don’t be afraid to push players a bit if they make characters that are
not well-rounded. You don’t want to take GMing to players’ interests to the
extreme of playing to their characters’ strengths all the time. If a character is
deficient in certain areas, you can and should take advantage of that.
Rewarding Your Players: 
Scrooge or Monty Hall?
Rewarding your players is an important and surprisingly subtle task. Some
GMs seem to come by it naturally, and others struggle to find balance. In this
section, we explore some of the ins and outs of keeping your players happy.
As GM, you might have a strong urge to shower your characters with cool
stuff to keep them happy. Such campaigns are called “Monty Hall” campaigns,
and despite how it might seem, they are not as much fun as campaigns in
which you have to work for your reward.
It is also possible for a GM to be too stingy, although it’s a much rarer prob-
lem. It is one thing to make a party work for their reward, but quite another
to deny them any reward whatsoever.
Money
Money is the most common and obvious, and in many ways the least effec-
tive, way to reward your characters. The main trick with rewarding your play-
ers’ characters with money is making sure that they have a need for it.
Uncovering a chest full of gold coins is no particular thrill if a character is
just going to take it home and throw it on the pile.
We find that the best way to make a player enjoy finding money is if you
instill a sense of desperation for cash in the characters in your game and not
just offer them interesting things to buy. This is one situation in which the
players have more fun when the GM is harsh. If you charge your characters
taxes, high fees for training, high rent, and large salaries for hirelings, they
will usually be a little bit worried about cash, and that much happier to see it
246
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

when they find it. It’s okay, and even a good idea, to let them have periods of
richness, but the more often their wallets are full, the less of a motivator
money will be.
You can also work expenses into the campaign plot. Put your party in a situa-
tion in which it needs to hire ships or mercenary armies or purchase large
pieces of equipment to complete a task. Another trick is to have the charac-
ters pick up dependents who require upkeep, such as jobless people on the
brink of starvation, or young parentless children with magical talents that
make them perfect for expensive schooling.
You have to be careful with the other side of the equation — giving charac-
ters useful things to buy with their money. Even though it’s good to give play-
ers something interesting to spend their money on, be careful about letting
them buy too much power. Not only will it upset the balance of the game and
make GMing more difficult, but they won’t appreciate what they have as
much. This is where it’s really a good idea to work with the character’s per-
sonal interests. Have they always wanted to open an art studio? Let them
stumble across a really good property for that project. Do they like fancy
cars? Let them find their dream car . . . but it’s only available if they act now.
These sorts of things can add flavor to a campaign without unbalancing it.
Special items
The biggest feeling of triumph Adam ever had in finding a special item was in
a sword-and-sorcery campaign he played in long ago. Through tremendous
effort, his character was able to locate and acquire a magic sword that added
+1 to skill, and +1 to damage. This was certainly not a powerful magical item
by most standards, but it was the only magical item in the campaign outside
of a few potions and scrolls. It allowed his character to face the were-rats that
were plaguing the party without resorting to only partially-effective silver
weapons. And the people marveled at its soft blue glow. Conversely, in another
campaign, Adam’s character collected magic swords that no one else wanted
to lug around and used them as garden stakes. The differences in how often
magic items appeared between the campaigns determined how important a
magical sword was to the character.
A special item might be something magic or a piece of technology not commer-
cially available. It can be anything that increases a character’s abilities in a
desired way. As with money, the main thing when using special items to reward
players is to create both need and desire and then do the minimum to meet it.
The fewer special items you hand out, the more they will be appreciated.
For purposes of reward, it’s probably best to limit special items to one or two
per character, or maybe even less. If you feel like handing out magic or spe-
cial goodies more often than that, consider using consumables, such as
magic elixirs or high-tech drugs, magic scrolls, unrechargeable wands with a
247
Chapter 16: Motivating Players

set number of charges, grenades that have special effects (sleep gas, stun-
ning, smoke clouds), and so on.
Also, don’t forget to use social rewards when appropriate. Sometimes a char-
acter’s exploits can earn him titles, the favor of powerful people, grants of
land, or just fame and fortune. This form of reward can be particularly power-
ful because it accentuates the players’ feelings of pride of accomplishment.
If you want to have your bad guys stocked with magical things but don’t want
the party to end up overstocked with them, you can use a number of strate-
gies. One favorite method is to have magic items powered by forces of evil,
such that they have some negative or corrupting effect on the wielder.
Another is to charge character points for any special items obtained, using
the rules for gadget-based powers. See Chapter 8 for more on adding powers
to your character. Of course, you will sometimes want to hand out special
items because they’re important to the campaign. We have had campaigns in
which magical items were designed with a certain character in mind for spe-
cific use in the campaign plot. You might even have a campaign in which mag-
ical items are freely available. That’s okay; just plan to reward them primarily
through other means than the acquisition of special items.
Character points
You should also consider rewarding your characters with extra character
points. These are awarded as bonuses at the end of the session for good play.
You’ll find that players are always happy to get extra character points, but you
don’t want to hand them out so often that your players come to expect them.
The critical issue with handing out extra character points is that you need to
keep people’s gaming styles in mind and try to be even-handed. Some people
are more outgoing than others and have a tendency to grab center stage.
Others are clever strategically and do more than their share of fighting for the
good of the party. If you reward the same players over and over and never
reward the players who are less proficient in the things you’re interested in
(or for the things they’re interested in but you may not be), you may end up
making them feel overlooked and undervalued. We do not think you have to
go all out to achieve an “everyone gets a trophy” attitude, but it’s good to try
to notice when people are doing a better job than they normally do.
Awarding character points is both an art and a science. As a general rule,
awarding an average of a point a night leads to very slow character develop-
ment. An average of two points a night is the standard in the GURPS commu-
nity. Higher point awards lead to the characters in your campaign developing
dramatically faster — probably too fast.
The difference of a single character point per session may not seem like
much, but it is quite dramatic over the long haul. 
248
Part IV: Running Your Own Adventure 

Beyond awarding extra character points, one trick to consider is to award
advantages or skills based on the characters’ actions — without making them
pay for it. For example, a brave and heroic action could earn a character a
rise in status or reputation, or some valuable contacts. A particularly brilliant
strategic move could give a character the Strategy skill, or an extra point in it
if they already have it.
Success
Lastly and most importantly, the main way to reward your players is to give
them a chance to succeed. Of all the ways to reward your players, this is the
most powerful, and if you do it well, the other methods become much less
important and can be adjusted or ignored as suits your campaign.
As with giving out treasure, the secret of rewarding through success lies in
being tough and not letting it come easily. Tough challenges are much more
fun to overcome than moderate or weak challenges. But it helps to go beyond
merely challenging your players, instead trying to give them the fear that their
characters really might lose: the murderer they’re tracking might get away, the
person they’re guarding might be kidnapped, or something of that nature.
Some GMs feel that in order for their players to appreciate winning, they have
to actually kill a few characters from time to time. Without the actual risk of
losing a character (the theory goes), combat loses its spice. Many excellent
GMs subscribe to this philosophy, but we have not found it to be necessary.
There are both pluses and minuses with the strategy of killing the occasional
character: It does set the stakes high, but if you regularly kill off characters,
players won’t care about them as much. It can also take some of the flavor out
of an epic campaign if the cast of characters keeps changing. If a character
stands over the smoking remains of his village, shaking his fist and yelling,
“You WILL pay for this, Bertram the Black! I swear you will pay!” and then he gets
killed a week later by someone else and is replaced with another character . . .
well, you lose some of the passion. If your campaign is a basic dungeon crawl
in which continuity of the story line isn’t important, you probably should plan
on killing the occasional character. But otherwise, we don’t feel it’s necessary.
So how do you scare your players if you aren’t particularly trying to kill their
characters? This question isn’t as hard to answer as it may seem. We’ve
found that a character dying isn’t really the ultimate failure in a campaign —
after all, you can always just write up a new one (or have a dead one come
back in another form, such as a ghost).
Realizing this, you should make good use of the other ways of losing.
Important NPCs can be killed, characters can be captured, things can be
stolen from the PCs, the party’s base can be destroyed, the enemies can
make effective moves in areas the PCs aren’t watching, and so on. Perhaps
249
Chapter 16: Motivating Players

Bertram the Black, mentioned in a previous paragraph, lures the party out of
town by using a clever ruse and then burns the town to the ground. These
types of threats can be as or more motivating than fear for a character’s life.
Even if you decide that you aren’t especially planning to kill off a certain
number of characters, you still need to scare the party. The question
becomes how to walk the knife edge between giving them a serious challenge
and killing them off.
We find it is almost always a good idea to lean toward overestimating your
party and, if necessary, throw them a few extra hints or clues or fudge their
enemy’s dice rolls if they don’t come through. As GM, it’s okay to cheat to
make the game better, although you should do this as little as possible. It is a
lot easier to scale down a challenge in a smooth and unobvious way than it is
to scale an insufficient one up when it’s proving too easy.
You can always add one more clue, but you can’t take clues away. You can
have an ogre fall under a sword blow when it really had a couple more hit
points left, but it looks bad if a couple extra ogres just happen to wander by
and join in a fight that is going too well for the characters’ side. Any fudging
you do should be in the spirit of fine tuning. You shouldn’t automatically let
your gaming group win every combat. If they get in over their heads, they
may have to run away, get captured, or — if they truly insist on being 
pigheaded — be killed.

e show you how to create your very own GURPS
universe for your campaigns. Do you want to have
technological space explorers discover a world where
magic works? Or would you rather have the citizens of
your highly technological world cope with an invasion 
of space-mages? One of the most unique and wonderful
things about GURPS is that your campaigns are not lim-
ited to one specific milieu or genre; GURPS is literally
generic — the only real limitation is your imagination. But
this versatility creates some added complexities that new
world-building Game Masters must confront.
In Chapter 17, we expose you to the different types of
campaigns you can create and what each one entails.
Chapter 18 gives you the keys to determining the most
fundamental features of your game universe — the “laws
of physics” that govern your campaign. After you have the
basic structure of your gaming universe established, you
can get down to the nitty-gritty of creating a plotline for
your campaign. We address these concerns in Chapter 19.
Of course, you’re going to need to populate your world
with nonplayer characters (NPCs) — the outlaws, allies,
bullies, and bystanders that your player characters meet
and interact with. Sometimes, how well-developed and
memorable the NPCs in a campaign are makes the differ-
ence between a good GM and a great GM. We guide you
through the process of creating memorable NPCs in
Chapter 20.
A fully realized and developed game world is rich with
nuance and zest that make it unique — even from other
campaigns in the same genre. We walk you through the
best ways to add flavor to your campaign in Chapter 21.

I
f you’re going to be a Game Master and run a campaign, the first thing you
have to do is decide on a game world to fit that campaign into. Steve
Jackson Games sells any number of different “worldbooks” that you can use
for this purpose, but if you’re like us, you may want to create a game world
that is uniquely yours. Even if you do use one of SJ Games’ “canned” worlds,
you may want to modify the world you’re using to throw off the expectations
of any players who have a copy of the worldbook that you’re using.
One of the greatest strengths of GURPS is its versatility and adaptability to
allow you to create any game world, or milieu, imaginable. Do you want a
swashbuckling campaign set on one of the moons of Jupiter? What about a
twenty-third-century space campaign in which the characters run afoul of the
horrors of the Things Man Was Not Meant to Know? Or can you imagine a
sword-and-sorcery campaign that has characters fighting off alien space
invaders? All of these campaign scenarios — and more — are possible with
GURPS. Your only limitations are the limitations of your own imagination.
This chapter shows you how to improve your campaigns by creating your
own unique game world.
Finding Inspiration — Worldviews 
and Plot Seeds
When you’re deciding on a campaign, the first thing you have to do is find a
source of inspiration to draw upon for its creation. The source for this inspi-
ration can be as grandiose as a vision of an entire universe, or it can be as
simple as an idea based on a punny punch line. We frequently use favorite

science fiction or fantasy novels, movies, or TV shows for inspiration —
remember that you don’t have to be true to the spirit of the book or show,
you merely use it as a jumping-off point to begin development of your cam-
paign. You might want to start by thinking up a single adventure and then
fleshing out the world around that one adventure. Some GMs find inspiration
by posing hypothetical problems in their own mind and then use the cam-
paign as a means of examining possible solutions.
Here are some examples:
 A grandiose vision: The GM creates the city “Tarn Attala,” which is posi-
tioned at the junction of all dimensions, and which depends upon the
stability of transdimensional gates for its existence. Tarn Attala sends
agents to worlds that have had their gates destabilized to do whatever is
necessary to alleviate the problem and to ensure the city’s continued
existence.
 A punny punch line: The GM makes finding the identity of an interdi-
mensional traveler — one “Sir Strong-Arm” — an integral part of a puzzle
the party has to solve. At the end of the campaign, the party finds out
that “Sir Strong-Arm” is none other than U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong.
(In the real campaign in which this took place, the entire party groaned
and threw food at the helplessly giggling GM at the moment of revelation.)
 Inspiration from literature: Bjoern drew upon Andre Norton’s Witch
World series, Marion Zimmer Bradley’s Darkover series, Patricia
McKillip’s Riddle of the Stars trilogy, and Mercedes Lackey’s Valdemar
series for inspiration for his Avonlea campaign. He freely and shame-
lessly stole elements and features from those (and other) fictional
worlds to flesh out Avonlea.
 Fleshing out from a single adventure: The party goes on a traditional
dungeon crawl that winds up in the Tomb of Thal-Karsh. In the process,
the GM decides that Thal-Karsh is an ancient Necromantic Priest-King
and a dark cult of his followers are trying to raise him from the dead.
Then the GM creates an order of holy warriors to oppose this cult and
builds the respective societies that support the actions of each side.
 Brainstorming hypothetical problems: “What would happen if a TL3
magical society were invaded by space aliens?” Or, “I’m sick of these
high-powered campaigns; how will these players do if I limit them to a
50-point campaign?”
It doesn’t really matter what you use for your inspiration, just so long as you
find something to inspire you to develop your world beyond the demands of
a single adventure. One word of advice: Don’t be afraid to discard ideas that
don’t pan out — all three of us have probably discarded three or four “inspired
ideas” for each campaign we’ve run. Before you start running your first
adventure, you might want to come up with a couple of “adventure seeds”
and develop them to the point that you think you can maintain this campaign
through several adventures.

Deciding on the Type of Campaign
Often the inspiration you use for your campaign will take you a long way in
deciding the milieu for the campaign: It may determine the setting, tech level,
available powers (if any), typical races, and general surrounding culture. But
one thing that it may not give you is help with deciding what type of cam-
paign it is going to be.
Regardless of the milieu or plot structure, there are five basic types of cam-
paigns, with several subcategories:
 Dungeon-crawl campaigns
 High-adventure campaigns
 Combat-focused campaigns
 Puzzle-focused campaigns
 Masquerade-type campaigns
255
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign
Don’t do it all yourself — Using sourcebooks
Even if you’re planning on running a campaign
that sprang out of the depths of your own sub-
conscious without any outside inspiration, you
don’t need to do all the work of creating every
detail of the game world. If you do, your players
will need to sit on their hands for a few months as
you hash out every last detail. Instead of doing
everything from scratch, consider the wealth of
resources that you can find from Steve Jackson
Games, as well as other reference material that
can give you a considerable leg up on having a
complex, memorable, and fun campaign — and
one that you get to run in this decade.
As an example, consider Avonlea, which you
were introduced to earlier in this chapter. When
he created this campaign, Bjoern drew on
everything he could get his hands on to provide
descriptive detail, gaming statistics, and filler
details to flesh out the game world. The different
GURPS worldbooks from Steve Jackson Games
proved to be an invaluable aid in this. In some
situations, he may have taken an animal here, a
monster there, or a world-specific power from
a third book. But, even though Avonlea is essen-
tially a jigsaw puzzle of pieces from different
GURPS game worlds, it ended up flowing
together seamlessly, and even the other experi-
enced GMs in the party frequently missed bits
and pieces that came out of worlds that they
were intimately familiar with.
Besides the assets of SJ Games, you have other
options for reference material. If you are basing
any part of your game world off of a popular fan-
tasy or science fiction series, you might want to
look for any concordances, technical manuals,
glossaries, or other references that can give
you more information. Encyclopedias are also a
great help, and these days the Internet can give
you information on pretty much anything you’re
curious about. Just keep your mind and your
options open, and take the time to do a bit of
research; you’ll more than make up the time you
expended in the amount of time you would oth-
erwise spend hashing out trivial gaming details.

Each of these basic types determines the primary focus of interaction between
the GM and the party, as well as the type of action that will take most of the
time in each adventure. This is usually a matter of your personal preference —
but you should take the preferences of your gaming group into consideration
as well. Ideally, each campaign will have each of these types mixed into its
structure, but you’ll find that one campaign type will generally predominate.
Please remember that you are not limited to using only one of these types in
any campaign, but if you do mix types, you need to let the players know that
the brain-teaser campaign you’ve promised might also include combat or
might have a diplomatic exchange as a decisive component of its activity.
Determining what type of campaign you’re most interested in creating affects
the shape of the individual adventures that you create for that campaign. You
need to convey this information to your players so that they can create char-
acters who appropriately fit into your campaign setting.
Dungeon-crawl vs high-adventure 
campaigns
Most gamers with some level of experience have been through at least one
dungeon crawl. This is a campaign scenario in which all the action takes place
in a dungeon — typically a warren-like series of rooms and corridors built in a
series of subterranean levels. Dungeons are filled with a collection of foes,
monsters, puzzles, traps, and treasures. The deeper levels are generally more
difficult and more dangerous than the upper levels, but other than that, there
is no logical organization to explain how this dungeon is able to feed and sup-
port all the random monsters and bad guys who have made it their home, or
why they haven’t all eaten each other by now. The earliest role playing cam-
paigns focused all their attention and all their action in dungeons.
Contrast the dungeon crawl with the high-adventure campaign, one similar in
scope to the epic or high adventures of science fiction and fantasy literature,
such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, the Lensman novels by E. E. “Doc”
Smith, or the Witch World collection by Andre Norton. In each of these sto-
ries, the protagonists are fully-integrated members of a society that is men-
aced by a hostile force that threatens to destroy the society and all its
people. In order to remain true to themselves and their ideals, the protago-
nists find themselves in situations that require them to oppose the conquer-
ing evil by traveling through the wilderness (or outer space), and into the
depths of evil’s domain, pitting their individual valor against The Enemy’s
256
Part V: Building Your Own World 

awesome power. Although they ultimately emerge from their struggles tri-
umphant, they find that every victory has a price. They may find that their
world has become diminished by their victory, or their battles have made
them strangers in their own homes, or that the cost of success means that
they can never return to their homes. They may even have been called upon
to voluntarily sacrifice their lives to overcome The Enemy.
These days, the more sophisticated, complicated (and difficult) campaigns
more closely resemble the epic nature of the high adventures of fantasy and
science fiction than they do the dungeon crawl, and GURPS is an excellent
system for realizing this. GURPS allows the GM to create a world and a soci-
ety that are uniquely his or her own and yet are internally consistent, well-
developed, remarkably detailed, and able to sustain the players’ willing
suspension of disbelief for the few hours every week (or whenever) that the
party has to explore the twists and turns of the GM’s imagination. NPCs can
be more than a collection of stereotypical classes, and each of the party’s
encounters can be with unique individuals who have their own motivations
and drives that can’t easily be discerned by knowing what they do for a
living, or by checking out their aura. The society of the world takes on a
richer and subtler flavor that can force both the GM and the players to
stretch themselves in order to fully take part.
These campaigns demand a more meaningful ethical stance by the GM and
the player characters than an arbitrarily assigned “alignment” — in other
words, it isn’t sufficient to simply give the player characters a designation of
Good, Lawful, Chaotic, or Evil without defining what those terms mean and
how they restrict a character’s options and decisions. With the judicious
manipulation of situations affecting the player characters’ social status or
mental disadvantages or the well-being of player characters’ Dependents,
Allies, or Patrons, the GM can find nearly any kind of emotional hook to moti-
vate the characters’ nobler natures to stand up against The Enemy and to
make the party more than just a collection of glorified bandits and grave 
robbers.
For example, in some game worlds, high Social Status (an advantage), or a
Code of Honor or a Vow (both disadvantages) can include an obligation to pro-
tect the well-being of the common people. Characters with these abilities ought
to have a strong game-world–based reason for living up to these obligations,
whether it be the threat of a loss of privilege or power, or the compulsion of the
character’s ethical code. Depending on the advantage or disadvantage, this can
apply  even if the campaign is set in a prosaic setting — such as, say, the cyni-
cal world of industrial espionage, where The Enemy is the mega-corp your
neighbor works for, and the threat is a chance at a greater market share; the
campaign can still carry overtones of the epic adventure.
257
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

Combat-focused campaigns
Combat-focused campaigns are the most common type of campaign for most
role playing systems, and they are the reason for the extensive dice-rolling
rules that determine outcomes. These campaigns rely primarily on the player
characters using force of arms to achieve their objectives. A good GM takes
several issues into consideration when creating a campaign in which combat
is common, such as the following:
 If you have an ethical good/evil dichotomy in your game world, and if
your party members are supposed to be the good guys, how do they jus-
tify engaging in violence as a matter of course?
 What legal consequences does the party have to face if they leave a trail
of bodies in their wake?
 What type of healing, if any, is available to the party as well as to 
their foes?
 What are the consequences of the death of a player character? Is resur-
rection a possibility? Is it commonly available? If not, how will you deal
with an upset player who has just lost a character that she spent many
hours creating and playing?
There are three subcategories of combat campaigns. We call them
 The party vs foes of equivalent strength
 The party vs foes of enormous strength
 The party as the dominant power in the game world
Each of these subcategories is independent of scope or milieu of the cam-
paign and can be played in any situation. They are described in the next few
sections.
Titanic battles: The party vs foes of equivalent strength
This type of campaign pits the player characters against foes of equivalent
strength. It doesn’t matter if the two sides are nearly omnipotent, 1,000-point
supers or the military commanders of two different armies, or if they are
merely 100-point street fighters squabbling over a disputed block of territory.
This subcategory of the combat campaign pits the players’ wits and strength
against that of the NPCs in a toe-to-toe conflict to determine dominance over
whatever prize or turf is at stake. Although there can be considerable strate-
gic and tactical maneuvering, and even the occasional use of guile, there is
little demand for problem-solving skills in this type of campaign beyond
those needed to determine how you can kill your foes more efficiently.
258
Part V: Building Your Own World 

This is a difficult subcategory of combat campaign for a GM to maintain over a
long period. It typically escalates through a progressive series of tougher and
tougher opponents as the party defeats successive foes and gains in strength,
resources, allies, and followers. You have to keep a careful balance in this sort
of campaign; you cannot allow the party to earn too much too fast, but you
have to keep the rewards commensurate with the risks and threats that the
party faces. If the campaign continues for some time, the party will logically
become major players in the political/social structure of your game world,
even if they started the campaign as 100-point characters who were only a little
tougher than normal. As the stakes get higher, the battles will logically involve
more combatants on each side, and so you had better be ready and willing to
arbitrate over the movements and actions of armies rather than of parties.
Another logical conclusion of this type of campaign is that, as the party
becomes more powerful and politically prominent, the demands of their
exalted status require the campaign to evolve into as much a diplomatic
wrangling campaign as a combat campaign. (For more on this type of cam-
paign, see the section, “Wrangling the diplomats: Negotiations and diplo-
macy,” later in this chapter.)
Against all odds: The party vs foes of enormous strength
This subcategory of the combat campaign is based on a common plot engine
in epic or heroic fantasy literature. In it, the party forms a band of intrepid
adventurers who single-handedly work to thwart the objectives of some sig-
nificantly more powerful foe. This type of campaign requires as much guile
and problem-solving as it does battle and is a good choice for blending a
combat-focused campaign with any type of puzzle-focused campaign. (For
more on puzzle-focused campaigns, see the section, “Puzzling campaigns,”
later in this chapter.)
Regardless of how powerful the player characters become, the enemy is
always bigger, always more powerful, or always more numerous than the
party. One advantage of this type of campaign is that typically it can take a
long time before the party can directly oppose and overcome the Mastermind
at the head of their enemy forces. Even then, the party can discover that
their long-time foe has been little more than a puppet working at the behest
of a greater, more powerful entity or organization, a development that makes
it easier to keep a plot line going over the long term, provided the party doesn’t
make stupid mistakes that end up pitting them against overwhelming forces
without hope of rescue or escape.
The likelihood of those stupid mistakes makes for a serious disadvantage to
this type of campaign. Players and player characters must have a high degree
of maturity and good planning and problem-solving skills; otherwise the cam-
paign can turn into a disaster. Some players refuse to exercise the necessary
259
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

caution that this type of campaign demands and take actions that would nat-
urally alert The Enemy to the party’s existence before they are ready to face
such scrutiny, or — believing that the GM will not wreck the campaign by
destroying them — they may foolishly provoke The Enemy in a way that logi-
cally would call down an overwhelming response.
You should decide what you will do in these circumstances when you are 
creating the campaign. Our suggestion: Tailor a response that logically fits
the operational model of The Enemy and give the party a means of escape
or rescue — but not before you have exacted considerable punishment for
their foolishness. You may destroy their secret hideout; make them lose 
a significant portion of their wealth, technology, magic, or other treasure;
or even deliberately target and kill the character or characters who are
being the most problematic to the campaign. And then let the survivors
get away to lick their wounds, nurse their injured pride, and perhaps learn
to approach the campaign with a little more caution and a little more
wisdom.
Overlords of the world: The party as the dominant power
This type of campaign sets the player characters up as the dominant power
in the environment. We hesitate even mentioning this type of combat cam-
paign because we intensely dislike it. Theoretically, it is possible to create a
campaign that puts the party in the role of righteous protectors of the game
world, using their powers to keep the forces of evil subdued. This type of
campaign caters to the players’ darker natures;  the party can ride roughshod
over all opposition, terrorize the common people, and pillage with impunity.
Frankly, we don’t see any point in a campaign of this sort, though it seems to
appeal to some players. This becomes, quite frankly, an “evil” campaign; the
only point to it seems to be to create a venue for the players to demonstrate
just how amoral and violent they can be, and just how much depravity they
can think up.
We don’t recommend that you create a campaign of this sort; in our experi-
ence, both you and your players will quickly become sickened by it.
Puzzling campaigns
Although there are several varieties of puzzling campaigns (also known as
puzzlers), the general drift of this sort of campaign is to require the party to
follow a set of clues, solve problems, answer riddles, and uncover mysteries
as the primary means of achieving the campaign objectives. This sort of cam-
paign requires much more mental effort on the players’ part than a combat
campaign; it is not sufficient to be able to roll three dice and “solve” the
puzzle. Regardless of the personality and powers of any character, it is the
player’s ability to deduce the answer based upon the clues provided by the
GM that determines the campaign’s success or failure.
260
Part V: Building Your Own World 

We break down the basic types of puzzling campaigns into the following 
categories:
 Mysteries
 Espionage campaigns
 Riddles
 Treasure hunts
 Conspiracy
 Exploration
Each of these subcategories is independent of scope or milieu of the campaign
and can be played in any situation. They are described in the next few sections.
Who-dun-it?: Mysteries
This is your basic mystery to discover the hidden truth about a person, loca-
tion, or object based upon a series of clues that the party uncovers and fol-
lows. It might be a standard murder mystery, or it might be a quest to
uncover the secret of a mysterious artifact or to find the location of lost
Shangri-la. This sort of campaign can also involve more supernatural matters,
such as a party of paranormal investigators tracking down Cthulhian horrors.
The party may or may not face direct opposition from a foe or foes who
desire to keep them from discovering the secret; this type of campaign may
require the party to face some combat, or it may require them to run from
everyone who tries to stop them.
A Who-Dun-It campaign can be a risky proposition for any GM because a
number of questions have to be answered:
 Are you able to create a scenario that will set the party in the right direc-
tion without giving away something that will lead them directly to the
answer?
 Are you able to develop a credible trail of clues that the party can follow?
 Are you sure that your party members (both players and PCs) have the
ability to ask the right questions and follow the right clues?
 Are you sure that your party members (both players and PCs) have the
ability to solve the puzzle after they have all the clues in place?
 Are you sure that this sort of campaign will keep the interest of all the
players in your gaming group?
 Do you have an alternative scenario to allow the campaign to continue if
the party cannot solve any particular puzzle you throw at them?
If you cannot answer “yes” to each of these questions, be prepared to see
your mystery campaign fail.
261
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

Despite the risks, this type of campaign can be remarkably entertaining and
rewarding for both GM and players. Don’t be afraid to lay down a trail of false
clues (red herrings), provided that you can be sure that you can put the party
back on track just at the moment when they realize the crushing truth: that
they have spent weeks following the wrong track. When done well, a mystery
campaign keeps the players intrigued and guessing about the ultimate out-
come of the adventure up to the very end. But, after one mystery is solved,
where do you go from there? Another mystery? The answer is up to you.
Double-O-who?: Espionage campaigns
An espionage campaign is the puzzler equivalent of a “the party vs foes of
enormous strength” combat-focused campaign because the party goes up
against an enemy organization that is much more powerful than the party
itself. The main difference, however, is that the “agents” in the party are
attempting to ferret out information about the doings of The Enemy, ulti-
mately foiling whatever dastardly plot is afoot and using any means at their
disposal to do so — preferably while keeping The Enemy ignorant of their
identities, activities, or the agenda of the agents’ own organization. Despite
what you may have seen in the movies, this sort of campaign typically
includes very little party-wide combat, although the elimination of the odd
guard or goon may be necessary.
This type of campaign is probably best for a small party of two or three
player characters. No party will ever have enough clout to take on the min-
ions of The Enemy in head-to-head combat. The more people who are
involved, the more difficult it is to avoid discovery while infiltrating The
Enemy’s stronghold, especially if the goal is to get out with the needed infor-
mation while remaining undiscovered.
An espionage campaign is also best for a short series of brief adventures
against a variety of foes. Each individual adventure to gain information is by
its very nature of much more limited duration than an adventure intended to
eliminate a particular threat. By definition, espionage campaigns can’t allow
the time-intensive set-combat scenarios of other types of campaigns, so the
adventures move much more quickly. Although there can be an escalating
series of adventures to uncover clues that lead the party deeper into the
heart of the conspiracy they need to uncover, it may stretch the players’ abil-
ities to suspend disbelief if the campaign doesn’t lead to the center of The
Enemy’s stronghold relatively quickly. After they have been in evil’s heart,
there isn’t much more allure or threat to working against that particular foe
and they will want to move on to the next target. Quickly, the characters in an
espionage-type campaign overcome most of the conceivable obstacles the
milieu has to offer. Unless all the members of the party are die-hard espi-
onage aficionados, or there is a means of changing to another game world or
setting, the adventures can go stale at this point.
262
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Brain-teasers: Riddles
We know a GM who would put a “test” at a key point in each of his adven-
tures. This test required the players to solve a problem or riddle in order to
successfully conclude the adventure. With this particular GM, the test was
almost always based upon a series of clues that the PCs gathered during the
course of the adventure; those clues became the elements of a story problem
in quantum mechanics, music theory, geometry, or higher mathematics. It
didn’t matter what skills the characters had, the adventure stalled until the
players could provide the GM with the right answer. In one instance, an entire
adventure depended upon the party’s ability to solve problems relating to
the mathematical structure of a tesseract in order to repair a system of inter-
dimensional gates. (Yes, the GM was working on a PhD in Mathematics —
Topology to be precise.)
This is an extreme example of a brain-teaser campaign. More rational exam-
ples still depend upon the players’ ability to solve riddles by using their real-
world knowledge rather than on the game knowledge of the characters. This
is very different than a Who-Dun-It campaign and is very dependent upon the
GM’s knowledge of the cognitive abilities and educational levels of the play-
ers. Its greatest appeal is to people who are geeks of the same stripe as the
GM in the real world (math geeks, computer geeks, English lit geeks, history
geeks, and so on), and it runs the risk of being boring or alienating to every-
one else. This type of campaign can be fun in very small doses, but we don’t
recommend forcing anyone to endure a steady diet of it.
X marks the spot: Treasure hunts
In this type of campaign, you give your party something like a partial map to
some fabled treasure, lost city, or other great and worthy prize. There they
go! Galloping off to find fame and fortune. And so does everyone else who
either has a portion of the same map (or other device) or who covets the
treasure and is willing to let the party do most of the legwork for him. The
treasure hunt gives you carte blanche to throw any sort of puzzle, combat, or
masquerade in the party’s way, provided it makes sense as a defense devised
to protect the coveted treasure. That means that if the treasure is the Death
Mask of the Atlantean God-King, you shouldn’t include brain-teasers about
Edwardian fashion — unless, of course, some time travel is involved.
This type of campaign is a staple for both literature and gaming and is good
for one good, long adventure at most. It can require the party to follow
obscure clues, engage in espionage and counter-espionage against both
friends and foes, fumble their way through brain-teasers, battle the minions
of The Enemy that menaces the successful conclusion of their mission, battle
the near-equal forces of their rival treasure hunters, and engage in the mas-
querade, both socially and diplomatically, while searching for clues. 
263
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

However, when the adventure reaches its conclusion — victorious or not —
that is it. You would be stretching the abilities of even the most credulous
and gullible players to suspend disbelief enough for them to find yet another
mysterious map or guide to yet another far-off prize; and even if you could
make it believable, the treasure hunt eventually becomes such an exercise
that only the die-hard fans of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft will continue to
enjoy. Many players find it difficult to feel any excitement after the second or
third time. If this is the case, let it go and either evolve the scenario into
another type of campaign or start a new campaign.
They ARE out to get you: Conspiracy
You don’t have to be paranoid to play in a conspiracy campaign, but it helps.
If the GM does her job right, even if you aren’t paranoid when you start play-
ing in a conspiracy campaign, you will be by the time it is over. In a conspir-
acy campaign, nothing is as it seems; the bad guys may or may not be “bad,”
and the good guys certainly aren’t “good.” Nothing that is known about
anyone — not even the PCs — can be presumed to be true. GURPS is remark-
ably effective for conspiracy campaigns, and the Illuminati game world pro-
duced by Steve Jackson Games is an excellent example. Fnord. If you want to
explore the true depth of a paranoid fantasy, we recommend that you read
the Illuminatus! trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. Fnord.
A conspiracy campaign is built with layer upon layer of lies, deception, and
misdirection. At its heart are the Secret Masters who may or may not be in
complete control of the game world and utilize their abilities to generate misin-
formation and misdirection to retain their control — if they truly are in control.
A conspiracy campaign is most effective if the players don’t know that they
are in a conspiracy campaign. That means that you present it as any other
type of campaign — and even run an adventure or two to lull your players
into thinking that they know what’s going on — but then, at some point, you
start inserting inconsistencies into the plotline. Running a conspiracy cam-
paign requires the GM to have a remarkably subtle approach; you can never
give anything away and you have to be able to control even your nonverbal
body language so that the players never catch on that their characters are
trapped in a web of lies and deceit.
In this type of campaign, the party’s ultimate goal is to uncover the truth and
expose the ultimate underlying conspiracy. Your objective as the GM is to
manipulate the emotions of the PCs and the players so that they are terrified,
outraged, and suspicious of everything and everyone — including each other.
To achieve this level of emotional manipulation, you have to be willing to play
tricks on both the players and their characters; see Chapter 21 for advice on
doing this.
264
Part V: Building Your Own World 

One strategy that really helps a GM running a conspiracy campaign is to
recruit one of the players as a secret accomplice (a ringer).This player will
still run a PC — and doesn’t know what is really going on any more than
anyone else — but his character is built with a motivation to support some
level of the conspiracy and to sabotage the efforts of the party to uncover the
truth. As GM, you have to lie to this player just as much as the rest of the
party — but your ringer knows that you’re lying to the rest of the party, too,
and believes that you are telling him or her the “real” truth. If you want to be
a truly evil GM (and give yourself substantially more work), you can recruit
each player in the party as your ringer, and lead each person to believe that
they are the only one you’ve approached.
Sometimes, you’ll need to provide information that only one PC has access
to. In a conspiracy campaign — more than any other type of campaign —
you need to let the player decide what, if any, information the PC shares
with the rest of the party. This means that you need to get information
to and from the player outside of the awareness of the rest of the party.
This can be through passing notes, taking the player into another room, 
or — if your gaming group is especially high-tech — Instant Messaging
them or calling them on their cell phone. However, if the GM goes off 
repeatedly to have a private conference with the same player, the rest 
of the party will begin to suspect that that player’s character is up 
to something, which reduces the effectiveness of that PC as a ringer. 
You also need to be careful that you don’t abandon your players for
extended periods of time — leaving them bored, twiddling their thumbs,
comparing notes amongst themselves, or even worse, losing interest in
your adventure.
A conspiracy campaign can be put into any sort of game world or milieu you
can imagine, and allows for any type of power or character level you want.
How the game progresses really depends on how devious  you can be as a
GM. Are the Secret Masters a malevolent force or are they secretly trying to
protect the world from destruction? Is that really the Secret Masters’ agenda
or is it something else entirely?
A conspiracy campaign can keep a party endlessly entertained. However,
before you create a campaign of this type, consider the members of your
gaming group. Some people are emotionally and intellectually unsuited for
this type of campaign, and if you allow the paranoia to run unfettered through
your game world, you may cause them significant emotional distress. We
wouldn’t recommend that you start this type of campaign for players whom
you don’t know well.
265
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

Where no one has gone before: Exploration
In an exploration campaign, the party of player characters are explorers out
to discover or map what lies beyond the boundaries of the known universe.
This can fit into any milieu or game world. Here are several examples:
 The campaign could be set in the Renaissance with characters out to
discover the “New World” or to land upon the newly-discovered lands
and trek into the continental interiors, meeting and coping with the cus-
toms of totally new cultures and civilizations.
 In a fantasy, high magic, or ultra-tech campaign, the characters could be
using inter-dimensional transportation to explore other dimensions or
realms of existence.
 Victorian-era characters could explore the heart of Africa, the polar
regions, or they could find the lost route into the Hollow Earth.
 In a modern campaign, characters can explore locations such as the
depths of the ocean and the heart of the solar system. High-magic fan-
tasy worlds can also use their own magical technology to explore space,
the subaquatic realms, and even subterranean environments.
 Explore the past — or alternate past — in a time-travel campaign. (If you
are interested in time-travel campaigns, then GURPS Infinite Worlds is an
invaluable resource to draw from.)
Exploration campaigns can be a great challenge to a GM and are fun to play;
typically they require a unique blend of the qualities of many of the other
types of campaigns described above. Regardless of the setting, exploration
campaigns all have several features and issues in common: 
 The quest for exploring new horizons must be motivated by something
more significant than simple curiosity. Usually this incentive is economic
or strategic in nature, or motivated by a specific threat.
 The party should face completely unfamiliar environments — unfamiliar
to the characters and, ideally, to the players as well. We think this ought
to be the case even if the party is exploring a historically well-known ter-
ritory. Keep in mind that you are not limited or restricted solely to his-
torically authentic campaigns; if you want, you can always explain away
the discrepancy as the result of a plot by historians to keep the real
truth from the people.
 The areas being explored should confront the party with threats to their
survival that are outside of the characters’  experience. Whether it is a
salt-sucking vampire from classic Star Trek, an entirely new form of dis-
ease, or navigational hazards never encountered before, the characters
266
Part V: Building Your Own World 

need to be confronted with challenges that require all of their ingenuity
to overcome.
 The inhabitants of the areas being explored must represent cultures that
are totally alien to the PCs’ experience — preferably to the players’
experience as well. That way, the party is forced to navigate and negoti-
ate their way through a tangle of strange local customs and beliefs.
Exploration campaigns can be maintained through many different adven-
tures; and a single campaign can have a wide range of problems and situa-
tions for the PCs to address. The only potentially negative aspect of this type
of campaign is that exploration campaigns are a lot of work to GMs, who are
forced to constantly create new and strange environments, cultures, and
creatures.
The masquerade
GURPS is the foremost role playing system for this type of campaign, and the
nearly-infinite variety of worlds available for a campaign takes the “shared
storytelling” element of role playing games to an entirely new dimension
beyond the reach of other systems. The focus of a masquerade-style cam-
paign is on the social interactions among the player characters and among the
characters and the NPCs. A masquerade-style campaign can be set in any
milieu and can further nearly any campaign plot. The emphasis here is on
role playing; the players must interact with each other and with the GM in
their characters’ personas.
Masquerades can be incredibly fun campaigns to play. We once played in a
campaign that spent several sessions (and countless e-mails between ses-
sions) doing nothing but role playing our characters at a dinner party; no one
but the GM needed to make any dice rolls the entire time. However, be
warned that some players (and GMs) find these campaigns to be deadly dull
if there isn’t some kind of battle against bad guys. You should also be aware
that some people may become a little too emotionally involved with the game
versus reality, and if two or more players in the party are secretly nursing
grudges against each other, this type of campaign might bring those grudges
out into open hostilities.
We’ve identified two different subcategories of masquerade-type campaigns
for you to consider:
 Social interactions between players and NPCs
 Negotiations and diplomacy
267
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

Each of these subcategories is independent of scope or milieu of the cam-
paign and can be played in any situation. They are described in the next
couple of sections.
Socialites and sociopaths: Social interactions
Social-interaction campaigns focus on the personal nature of the interactions
among player characters and among player characters and NPCs. Frequently,
these campaigns don’t really have a “party” so much as a collection of player
characters in the same campaign, each working toward her own personal
agenda, potentially at the expense of the other player characters. Much of
this type of campaign can revolve around trying to figure out what makes the
other characters tick, what makes them twitch, and what you can either get
out of them or get them to do for you. We call this type of campaign
“socialites and sociopaths” because the objective frequently becomes identi-
fying which very charming, dangerous, and seriously deranged individual is
out to get you and to get to them first.
Wrangling the diplomats: Negotiations and diplomacy 
Your party has been running a combat campaign for some time, and they’ve
amassed a sizeable portfolio of real estate and other assets that they now
control. Suddenly, the possibility that a battle in their territory can cause cat-
astrophic damages to the party’s assets even if they win makes even the most
hard-line hawk think twice. It’s time to seriously consider the use of negotiat-
ing skills rather than force of arms to further the party’s aims. In diplomatic
campaigns, the party members are all on the same side (more or less), and
the focus is to find ways to forge alliances with NPC Warlord X to defend
against — or attack — NPC Warlord Y, and at the same time try to negotiate
to delay and deceive Warlord Y until the party has all the alliances it needs to
achieve a crushing victory (possibly involving negotiations with Warlords Z,
Q, M, and W in some way).
Another variation of this type of campaign is focused on mercantile trading
and is most popular with the fans of GURPS Traveller, although it can fit
into any milieu we can imagine. The mercantile campaign uses the mas-
querade for the PCs to locate and open new trading ventures, markets, or
suppliers. The primary motive here is financial profit rather than fighting
evil or defending territory. Although many enjoy this type of campaign,
others will find the financial aspects dry as dust. We recommend that you
make sure your players are interested in such a campaign before you get
them involved.

Part V: Building Your Own World 

Establishing and Maintaining 
Game Balance
Now that you’ve gotten the initial physical and social dynamics of your cam-
paign in place, you need to start thinking about game balance.
What is game balance? It is a nebulous, poorly defined, and even more poorly
understood concept that is integral to all good (that is, enjoyable) campaigns.
It is based as much on the GM’s instincts and quick thinking as it is on careful
planning and calculation, and sometimes you feel like you’re never going to
get it right. Game balance is completely the responsibility of the GM, and it is
game balance that distinguishes a good Game Master from a good world
designer.
In essence, game balance is that delicate, constantly-moving point at which
the threats, rewards, dangers, and pleasures of a campaign are perfectly in
sync with the abilities of the party of player characters. When you’ve
achieved game balance, the party cannot walk roughshod over your adven-
ture, but the adventure doesn’t overpower them, either. The party has the
chance to ultimately prove victorious against foes, but only if they exert
themselves to the utmost to do so. As well, good game balance means that
the treasures, rewards, and information that characters get are emotionally
satisfying to them but are commensurate with their current abilities and do
not risk making them inappropriately powerful to face the next set of prob-
lems you’re going to throw at them. Good game balance means that the
player characters are more or less following the plotline that you’ve estab-
lished, while they still feel like they are in control of their own destinies and
have the freedom to make their own choices.
How do you find and maintain game balance in your campaign?
If you know of a formula, let us know. We certainly don’t know of a surefire
way of maintaining game balance, but we can give you some pointers. Here is
a list of tips that help us keep our campaigns more or less balanced:
 Understand motivations. Everyone in your campaign has two sets of
motivations: the player’s and the player character’s. When we start a
campaign, we ask our players to briefly describe what motivates their
characters . . . and then we take it with a grain of salt. Well, not really,
but we also try to understand what it is that the players find most moti-
vating, regardless of what they say their characters want. 
269
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

For example, Stuart may say that his Bardic Assassin is most interested
in promoting the interests of her clan, but those of us who know him
know that he’s most interested in establishing a personal power base
that is independent of the external authority of his character’s clan. We
also know that he prefers to use his character’s Fast-Talk and Diplomacy
skills much more than her Knife skill. 
A GM who faces this situation struggles to find a plot scenario that
hooks Stuart emotionally by extending the offer of increasing his charac-
ter’s personal power base through negotiation while at the same time
setting the scenario so that the character is promoting the best interests
of her clan. The character may feel guilty that she suddenly finds herself
at the head of a small force of warriors who owe total allegiance to her
and not to her Clan Lord, but Stuart is tickled pink. 
Any GM who has Bjoern for a player quickly finds out that gaining or
improving his character’s ability to Fly puts a ring through Bjoern’s nose
that has him willingly following wherever the GM wants him to go,
regardless of the character’s skills, powers, or motivations.
 Have two backup plans for each adventure. You created an adventure
that led the party into a combat situation that you thought they would be
able to handle. Everything seems to balance out by the numbers, but the
party is getting trashed. Half the characters are unconscious, the other
half are all wounded and can’t heal, and the foes are barely scratched.
You see no way for them to survive this battle, let alone the next situa-
tion that you have waiting for them.
Alternatively, you’re in the same combat scenario and the situation is
reversed; the enemy is being quickly defeated, and the party hasn’t
broken a sweat. Players are becoming complacent, and people are wan-
dering in and out of the room. They’re not really interested because
they’ve realized that they’re not that threatened in this particular battle.
In either situation, you’ve lost game balance. How do you restore it?
By having two different backups. One for times when things are going
badly for the party — so badly that you doubt they will survive to con-
tinue the adventure — and one for when the situation is too easy for
them and you need to quickly turn up the heat on the entire party. Exactly
how you do this depends on the nature of the party and of the campaign,
and we can’t decide that for you, but here are some suggestions:
• Fudge some die rolls. If your party faces annihilation, you can
make some of the bad guys suddenly fumble (be sure to swear con-
vincingly when you do, the players will never guess otherwise). If
your party is demolishing your NPCs, your bad guys can suddenly
get in some “critical hits” to even the score and knock the compla-
cency out of the players (it helps to be a little smug then).
270
Part V: Building Your Own World 

• Bring in some help. This could be a “wandering” NPC who comes
to the party’s — or the enemy’s — rescue. This contingency plan is
effective, but unless you handle it very gently (and use it very
sparingly), it is not very believable. 
Or, if you have an NPC in the party, he might “decide” to rescue a
dying party by using that invocation, magic item, transdimensional
portal, nerve-gas grenade, or other device that either calls in help,
lets the party escape, or throws the enemy off-balance. The same
saving device might also put some life into your dying NPCs: The
leader of the enemy forces could have some equivalent device or
spell that he uses as a last-ditch measure to save his hide.
• Have a back door in place. A back door is a plot-device in the cam-
paign that can be used only once to turn the tables in a battle.
Setting up the back door takes some initial groundwork on your
part . Its success depends upon the ability of the players to
remember to use the back door in the first place. If they don’t
remember, you can either find a way to prompt them (if you’re a
very nice GM), or you can let them get what they deserve.
If your NPCs need a quick escape, you can always ad lib a back
door if you need it unexpectedly.
• Change the rules. By this we mean make some change to the envi-
ronment that favors whichever side is losing. If the battle is on a
space station, say, and the losing side has the advantage in free
fall, then cause the artificial gravity to fail (caused, of course, by
some action of the party, intentional or not). Or make the lights go
out. Or make the room fill with water. You can make the change to
either even the tables or to force both sides to break off combat.
Regardless of which tack you take, you need to make some effort to
make it appear that whatever happened was the result of either sheer
chance, blind luck, or good planning on the party’s part. Don’t let them
realize that you’ve manipulated the situation to either keep them alive
or to make them work harder.
 Modify on the fly. Don’t feel like the situation you have written down is
cast in stone. Pay attention to the problems you’ve had to deal with in
earlier stages of the adventure and adapt the current scenario to
address those problems. If the party got whipped and needed your inter-
vention in the previous combat, then you should consider cutting back
on the numbers or abilities of the next foes they encounter. Or if their
last battle was a cakewalk, then you should beef up the strength of the
next enemies that they face. At all times, you need to be flexible to keep
the campaign flowing in the direction you want it to go.
271
Chapter 17: Creating a Complete Campaign

 Expect the unexpected. We’ve mentioned something like this at several
points previously in this chapter. You will function best as a GM when
you come to terms with the fact that the party is going to — some way,
somehow — throw all your most carefully laid plans into disarray. They
may decide to take a completely unexpected route into the evil over-
lord’s lair, one you didn’t expect and didn’t prepare for; they may com-
pletely bypass all of the evil overlord’s minions and find a way to
confront him immediately; or they may solve the puzzle you’ve spent
weeks crafting in half the time and with half the clues than you wanted.
As GMs, we’ve had all of these things happen to us. All you can do is
accept it, get over it, and adapt: maybe the evil overlord filled in that old,
unused sewer line with concrete, so the party can’t get through; maybe
the evil overlord has a hidden escape route to a helicopter and flees just
before the party crashes into his Inner Sanctum; maybe the puzzle they
solved turns out to be only the first piece of an even greater puzzle.
 Follow the party’s lead. During the course of an ongoing campaign, pay
attention to what you hear the players say about their characters. Listen
for clues as to what they might find interesting, intriguing, challenging,
terrifying, or motivating and then build an adventure that incorporates
those elements. The more you can tie up the emotions of your players
and their characters in the purpose behind any given adventure, the
more willing they are to go where you want them to go.
 Don’t let them have their own way all the time. Who says that every
clue has to lead in the right direction? Who says that every snitch has to
give accurate information? Who says that every adventure has to be suc-
cessful? Nothing cuts into player complacency like ignobly fleeing from
an adventure and facing censure and ridicule from patrons and allies
because of it. The campaign loses its edge when players are assured that
they will always be successful in the end. 
We don’t recommend that you do this all the time, or even often, but
occasionally pitting them against a situation that leaves them with the
taste of crow in their mouths will keep the edge on your adventures.
The same goes for death. Even in campaigns in which characters can
“recover” from death with a quick trip to the Healer’s Guild, there needs
to be some final consequence that the players feel hovering in the back-
ground from time to time. Bjoern has occasionally inserted an NPC into
the party whose sole purpose was to be killed after she became accepted
as a valuable party member. And yes, sometimes even player characters
(especially ones who have created ongoing conflicts in the party) ought
to face the “final darkness.”
 Be sensitive to player sensibilities. We once played in a campaign in
which the GM had determined that the reason his game world had so
many half-orcs was because orcs habitually gang-raped all prisoners,
and the GM used this as a constant threat every time the party encoun-
tered orc opponents. This was offensive to many players, especially the
272
Part V: Building Your Own World 

young woman in the party who had actually been raped. There can be
such a thing as too much realism in a campaign, especially when it ends
up being hurtful and cruel. Enough said.
 Sometimes the piper has to be paid. If members of the party end up
breaking with impunity the ethical or legal strictures of your society — or
even worse, if they do really stupid things in your campaign — they need
to face the consequences of their actions. And the consequences need to
be within the realm of the game world. If they break the law, sic the police
on them. If they break divine law, make them face divine retribution. If
they do something stupid, let the situation run to its logical conclusion.
The players may wind up cursing and taking your name in vain when-
ever discussion of the situation comes up in the future, but they’ll
quickly learn to appreciate the consequences of their actions. (Stuart is
still mad at Bjoern — 13 years after the fact — because Bjoern allowed
the party’s secret hideout to be blown up by the enemy after another
player stupidly led the enemy to their lair. He might still be mad, but he’s
never allowed another situation like that to develop in one of Bjoern’s
campaigns ever again.)
 Don’t give away the moon. When the party finishes the adventure and
tallies up the loot, they should not wind up significantly wealthier or
more powerful than when they started. Sometimes this takes cunning
and finesse on your part, especially if you enjoy seeing the greed shining
gleefully on all of the players’ faces when they finally pry open the door
to the demon-king’s treasure vault. Or, if you’re like Bjoern, you may gain
even greater pleasure in seeing the looks on the players’ faces when
they realize that they might have overcome all of the demon-king’s min-
ions, figured out all of the traps and curses that lay upon the treasure,
found their way into the hidden vault, and then ultimately realize that
they can only take away the smallest fraction of what they have won
because they know that reinforcements are en route, a speedy escape is
their only means of survival, and carrying all those billions of copper
coins will only slow them down.
When it comes to motivating the characters, GMs must walk a fine line: dan-
gling the promise of great treasure over the heads of the party is a surefire
way to get them interested in your adventure, but if you actually let them
have it, you’ve unbalanced the campaign, potentially beyond repair. You can
set them on a quest to find the Sword of the War God, but we suggest that
when they find it, it is either useless (perhaps it’s 15 feet long, or totally rusted
through, or requires them to sacrifice 1,600 innocent people before they can
benefit from its powers), or they find only a part of it and have to go on addi-
tional quests to find the other parts. In the latter case, you can make the part
that they find give them some minor advantage, which increases with each
piece that they acquire. If you handle it correctly, by the time they have the
full artifact assembled, they have sufficiently increased their abilities to the
point that an item with that much power is in keeping with their personal abil-
ities and doesn’t become an unbalancing element in your campaign.

Part V: Building Your Own World 
Introducing Avonlea — An epic adventure
Avonlea is the setting of a campaign that Bjoern
created and that we have been gaming in off-
and-on for the last 11 years. We refer to Avonlea
throughout Part V as an example of creating a
unique game world for a campaign. Although it
was initially based on GURPS Third Edition, it is
proving remarkably easy to transfer over to the
new GURPS Fourth Edition rules.
Avonlea is an extremely complex game world.
On one level, it’s a basic TL3 fantasy campaign
with lots of additions. Players have the option of
using standard GURPS magic, rune magic,
psionics, a unique paranormal power called
Land Rule (see Chapter 21 for a description of
Land Rule), several different martial arts,
alchemy, and shamanism. Most player charac-
ters are human, but some are members of
diverse races such as the Were Folk (racial
shamanic lycanthropes), the Fur Folk (bipedal
felines with innate electrokinesis), the Lizard
Folk (three-foot-tall reptilian Telepaths), the
Feather Folk (humanoids whose arms work as
functional wings), and more.
Avonlea is a land with a “dark and storied past.”
The current human settlers arrived in Avonlea
approximately 500 years ago, fleeing from some
devouring evil on their own world through a
transdimensional gate. In Avonlea, they found
many ruins and the now-savage descendants of
a previously enlightened and advanced civiliza-
tion that had destroyed itself in a cataclysmic
battle between the opposing forces of “Light”
and “Darkness.” Over the intervening centuries,
humanity faced and overcame innumerable
obstacles and foes to eventually spread through
the entire land of Avonlea. During that time, their
culture evolved and adapted to better deal with
the demands of their new environment.
When Bjoern initially conceived of this cam-
paign, he saw two primary ongoing plot threads:
 The first thread is the ever-present threat of
the residual evil from the distant past that
still exists in pockets of supernatural power
called Fanes. Some Fanes are “Of the Light,”
others are “Of the Shadow,” but most are
“Of the Dark.” Unwary travelers who dis-
turb these Fanes could find themselves
gifted with healing or strange powers of
protection (but at a cost of forming pacts
with different supernatural forces) if it was
a “Fane of the Light,” or they could find
themselves facing soul-consuming evil if it
was a “Fane of the Dark.”
 The second thread is the quest for knowl-
edge. Because of how the people of
Avonlea arrived on this world and because
of the centuries of warfare, loss, and depri-
vation that they have endured, much knowl-
edge has been lost. Whether it is finding the
lost skill of making carbon steel, hunting
down a legendary spell to add to the
severely restricted spell lists of the mages,
or discovering the ancient history of the
local Dale to find a way to bind the Fane of
the Dark that has been luring children to
hideous fates for the past three months,
learning more about the world and regain-
ing lost knowledge are imperative for the
survival of society.
In gaming terms, Avonlea is considered an epic
adventure scenario because the action centers
around more than a simple quest for treasure
and personal enrichment. The characters are
fully integrated into the surrounding society and
act in response to threats to their families, their
allies, and their leaders. They are fighting to
hold back “the Darkness” and to improve the
fortunes of everyone they know.

Chapter 18
Setting the Stage for Your World
In This Chapter
 Considering the forces within your world
 Deciding on the role of the divine
 Determining the availability of supernatural abilities
 Establishing the level of technology
 Creating culture in your world
I
f you’ve decided to create your very own campaign world, you need to
start with the most basic of all issues: the laws of physics in your game
world, which determine much of how your campaign progresses. No, you
don’t have to work out your own version of the Laws of Thermodynamics,
but you do need to determine what is and what is not possible in your game
world. In order to share the benefit of our collective experiences and to make
matters as easy for you as possible, in this chapter, we present a decision-
making process for determining the physical, metaphysical, and cultural
aspects of your game world.
Deciding on Deity
The first issue we suggest addressing for your game world (the first “law” of
its reality, if you will) is whether you want to include divine forces that can
affect the course of events. Your answer to this question will have a pro-
found, but perhaps hidden, impact upon nearly every aspect of the campaign.
Remember, you not only get to determine what is real in the campaign, but
what the player characters believe to be real.
You may have a game world in which the reality is that, whatever god or gods
exist, the divine take(s) no active role in any events. That doesn’t mean that
the characters in your world — including the players or their characters —
know this; they may either be devoutly religious themselves, with firsthand

empirical experience to support their beliefs, or they may know NPCs who claim
that they have had such experiences. Who knows? The power of belief may be
all that is needed to unlock the hidden potential for power in your world.
Another twist would be to tell the players that the god or gods are not real in
your world, when in fact, they are not only real, but they take an interest and
actively interfere in world events. You could weave this into an ongoing plot
of the campaign; the party repeatedly and (at least initially) unknowingly
interacts directly with one or more deities. The mounting evidence gradually
forces them to realize that they are dealing with a being or beings that are
much more than merely human.
Keep in mind that you can also create a cosmology that has supernatural
beings that aren’t exactly deities but do receive worship from human beings.
Most shamanic worldviews and religions, like Shinto, venerate spirit beings
that are not gods on an individual basis, but collectively can take on that role.
In Avonlea, the cult of the High Ones worships the spirits of nature and
teaches that the Land Rule Powers of the Kindred originate from an ancestor
who was a nature spirit who took human form.
Many GMs don’t consider using deities in high-TL campaigns, having deter-
mined that the presence of technology makes matters of faith and belief
superfluous. Even so, you may want to consider how the presence of the
divine may manifest itself in your high-TL campaign. There’s no reason you
can’t use both.
We’re not going to tell you what decisions to make on this issue. This isn’t a
test with right and wrong answers, but each decision you make has conse-
quences in the development of your campaign. We have included a list of 20
questions below that you can use to help you clarify whether a deity exists in
your game world and, if so, what its nature and role will be. When you’re
reading over these questions, keep in mind that every time you decide to
answer “Yes,” you have just increased the complexity of your campaign and
the amount of work you’ll have to put into it. If you’re planning a high-TL
campaign, you may want to ask these same questions about the role of tech-
nology in your campaign.
The following questions can help you determine the nature of deity in your
campaign:
 Does a deity exist in your game world? More than one?
 Is the deity a discreet, self-aware, and intelligent entity?
 Is the deity actively involved in the affairs of the world?
 Does the deity have supernatural messengers or servants?
 Do different deities represent opposing ideologies? Do they fight?
 Is it possible for mortals to communicate with a deity?
276
Part V: Building Your Own World 

 Do mortals accept or believe in the existence of a deity?
 Do the deities impose or enforce specific moral or ethical codes on their
worshippers with rewards or punishments?
 Do mortals have an afterlife in your game world?
 Can deities manifest in the physical realm?
 Do deities grant special powers or abilities to a priesthood or other
class of worshippers?
 Does the priesthood have any special social or political status in mortal
society?
 Do the deities demand that their worshippers oppose any of their coun-
terpart’s worshippers?
Go back over this list, and for each question that you answered “Yes” to,
write a series of bullet points listing the ways you want to set up how that
particular issue translates to your campaign. We’ve included an example of
how Bjoern answered three of these questions for his Avonlea campaign:
 Can deities manifest in the physical realm?
YES, but only in certain locations without dire consequences.
• The Great War of Adepts ended with  a cataclysm 5,000 years ago,
which caused the fabric of reality to be brittle — unable to with-
stand the strains of great Power manifesting in any single location.
• Because of this brittleness, deities may physically manifest — and
channel their Powers — only into areas that have been specially pre-
pared and fortified to support the strain their divine manifestation
puts on the space-time continuum. These areas are the Temples,
Abbeys, Monasteries, and Fanes.
• Any divine manifestation outside of these special areas has a high
probability of creating a rupture in the space-time continuum with
dire and catastrophic consequences for anyone in the immediate
vicinity — including the deity.
 Do deities grant special powers or abilities to a priesthood or other
class of worshipper?
YES, different deities do it in different ways depending on if they are cat-
egorized as Old Ones or Quantum Powers — and they have different
types of servants: the Old Ones turn their servants into Wizards; the
Quantum Powers select favored worshippers into Priests.
• Priests receive Power Investiture for specific Colleges of Magic that
are appropriate for that particular deity. Generally, Priests must
learn the spells of those Colleges through ordinary means,
although a deity may grant them the knowledge of a specific spell if
the Priest has sought a Boon, has been particularly devout, and
has adhered to the ethical strictures of the cult.
277
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

• Wizards receive a supernatural Power for specific abilities that are
appropriate for the deity in question and that match the personality
of the particular Wizard. Each Power has a Geas (taboo) attached to
it — a responsibility that compels the Wizard to further the inter-
ests and agenda of that deity. The point cost and specific purposes
of each Geas depend upon the deity and the powers granted to the
individual Wizard. If the Wizard does not fulfill the Geas, he loses
the Power — and all experience points that he spent on it.
 Does the priesthood have any special social or political status in
mortal society?
YES, but it’s different for each cult and can be grouped into two categories:
• The word Priest refers to the servants of a deity that Avonlea soci-
ety “approves” of. These are the Druids and Bards of the Cult of
the High Ones, the Dames of the Temples of the Undying Flame,
and the Monks of the Order of Adamantine.
• The word Wizard refers to the servants of the “Old Ones” who are
the deities who reside in the different Fanes scattered around the
countryside. Some of the Old Ones are Of the Light, and some are
Of the Darkness; all are feared and mistrusted by humans, as are
their servants, the Wizards. Anyone who is known to be a Wizard,
even if he serves  one of the Old Ones of Light, can expect to be
shunned, outcast, even stoned by the Dalesfolk.
After you have expanded upon each of the 20 primary questions with general
points, you can then go on to flesh out each point in more detail. In the example
from the Avonlea campaign, Bjoern might flesh out the first question he
answered above with a table of possible consequences for divine manifestations
outside of their special areas. For the second question, he might list the specific
Power Investitures each of the three priestly orders could receive, and so on.
If you follow this structure, you’ll develop a complete cosmology for your
game world before you know it.
Having a divine presence in your campaign can be a lot of fun and can signifi-
cantly add to the overall feeling of realism and completeness for the players;
however, we suggest that you exercise some caution when handling some
aspects of this issue.
Be considerate of players’ sensitivities
This is especially true if your game world is modeled after the real world.
Some GMs have the tendency to use their campaigns to mock or ridicule 
278
Part V: Building Your Own World 

certain religions that they dislike. This can be especially problematic if, unbe-
knownst to the GM, one or more of the players is sympathetic to — or is even
a member of — the religion being denigrated. Typically this can result in an
angry exchange of words, hurt feelings, the withdrawal of a player from the
group, and even the loss of one or more friendships. Our advice: Don’t use a
real religion as “The Enemy” or as a source of comic relief. Don’t even closely
model your evil or silly or ridiculous cults after any religion that has adher-
ents in the real world.
Make your miracles miraculous
If you’re running a campaign with a low voltage of paranormal elements
or activities, then anything that comes outside the bounds of the expecta-
tions of the players or the characters can seem pretty darn miraculous.
You can have entire villages dropping to their faces in awe from someone
who can dance a flame on the tip of her finger — something that would be
greeted with yawns in most campaigns with any kind of reliable magic or
power usage.
But what do you do in those campaigns in which any quick trip to the local
Healer’s Guild can resurrect your dead companions, and flying castles don’t
even spook the village cattle? The abilities of a deity need to be infinitely
greater than the highest level of power mortals can attain in your game world,
regardless of what that level might be. Don’t let the deities of your game
world become little more than super-powerful mages; if you let that happen,
they’ll lose their effectiveness as guides, guardians, or sources of inspiration
for the characters.
Use divine intervention sparingly
No matter how many holy orders the characters in the party have taken,
remember this: If the actions of a deity become commonplace and miracles
abound with every trial the party faces, then your players and their charac-
ters will become jaded, and you can do next to nothing (short of scrapping
that campaign) to inspire them with awe and wonder or terrify them with
their insignificance and futility. The last thing a GM wants to hear out of his
players is “Ho Hum. Do we have to deal with another Mad God? Well, let’s get
it over with before the pizza arrives.”
Chapter 20 addresses the issue of NPCs who tend to overpower or dominate
a campaign. More than anyone else, deity NPCs are the most naturally
inclined to assume this role. 
279
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

Pondering the Perils of Powers
After you’ve decided on the what, when, how, and why of the divine in your
campaign, you need to focus on magical and paranormal abilities. What are
your mere mortal player characters going to be able to do? What are they
going to have to face from other mere mortal characters? In this case, we’re
talking any type of ability a PC or non-supernatural NPC can gain, if any. This
includes both magic, discussed in Chapter 7, and any and all other “non-
magical” but still paranormal abilities, discussed in Chapter 8.
Steve Jackson Games had published a plethora of books about different para-
normal abilities for third-edition GURPS. Among the titles covering various
forms of magic and supernatural abilities, are
 “Standard” magic, covered by the books Magic and Grimoire.
 “Alternate” magical systems such as Religion, Castle Falkenstein, Voodoo,
The Cabal, and Technomancer, among others.
 “Supernatural-but-not-really-magical” milieus such as Horror, Spirits,
Undead, Faerie, Goblins, and Shapeshifters.
 “Paranormal-but-not-necessarily-magical” abilities had Psionics, Supers,
Lensman, and more.
 “Not-paranormal-but-definitely-cinematic” categories such as Martial Arts,
Cyberpunk, Bio-Tech, Robots, Time Travel, and who knows what else.
We’re not even going to try and categorize Illuminati U.
Currently with GURPS’ fourth edition, the distinction is between Magic
(GURPS Magic), Powers (GURPS Powers), and Martial Arts (GURPS Martial
Arts), yet all of these variations are still possible. (And, we should note, more
GURPS fourth edition titles are forthcoming.) For simplicity, we use the phrase
“paranormal abilities” to refer to anything a PC or NPC can do that is outside
the capabilities of normal folk in the real world.
So, as a budding world-builder, you have to decide what is and is not going to
be possible in your game world. Through the rest of this section, we present
you with questions that we’d like you to consider (both the pros and cons)
and make a decision for each one.
Is your game world going to 
have paranormal abilities?
If the answer is yes, are these paranormal abilities going to be
280
Part V: Building Your Own World 

 Based on interaction with the supernatural? This can be through spells,
rituals, binding spirits, prayer, or any other means of tapping into the
unknown.
 Based on meta-human capabilities and an expanded human potential?
This can be via psychic abilities, super-powers, and even through
extreme physical and mental conditioning in the martial arts.
 The result of an advanced technology?
 Of more than one type?
For example, technology and magic could coexist in your world, as could
super-powers and technology. Or perhaps the mages and the psionics are
fighting for dominance in your world. 
How much do the people in your world
know about paranormal abilities?
For that matter, how much will the player characters in your game world
know about paranormal abilities? What is the societal position on the subject
of paranormal abilities? Is the existence of paranormal abilities taken for
granted, or is it a closely guarded secret, shrouded by centuries of religious
dogma? Your decision on this question will determine a lot about how your
world works and how the characters with a paranormal ability interact with
those without one. You could choose to have the knowledge of paranormal
abilities in your world be any of the following:
 Common knowledge: The average person can look in the phone book
under “Superheroes” to get his cat out of a tree, or the local magic shop
sponsors its own peewee baseball team. Anyone with exceptional abili-
ties can easily find someone to help him figure out how to use them.
 An open secret: Everyone knows that people with exceptional abilities
exist, but they don’t advertise or announce it and do their best to blend in
with everyone else. People with paranormal abilities have probably estab-
lished certain gathering spots to meet each other, and anyone looking for
them will eventually be able to find them with a little detective work.
 In the closet: The public suspects that paranormal abilities exist, but
the people with these paranormal abilities take active steps to keep from
letting their family, friends, and neighbors find out about them. Having a
paranormal ability may be considered shameful or demonic. Finding a
teacher or companions who also have these paranormal abilities is more
difficult, but certainly not impossible. It’s possible that the people with
these abilities send out their own watchdogs to identify new manifesta-
tions of paranormal abilities and quickly bring them into the family so
that they learn how to keep their abilities out of the public eye as well.
281
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

 A guarded secret: The existence of such paranormal abilities may be the
subject of the mythology of the local religion, or there may be supersti-
tious beliefs about them, but for some reason, the people who have the
paranormal abilities (or the people who control the people who have the
paranormal abilities) take active, sometimes drastic steps to keep their
existence under wraps. Anyone who begins to demonstrate these types
of abilities is quickly identified and snatched up by the “secret orders” of
people who have these paranormal abilities. Ironically, this situation typi-
cally makes it extremely easy to find teachers and trainers.
 Top secret: Perhaps the paranormal abilities exist because of govern-
ment experiments on a limited number of people. The people who are
blessed (or cursed) with these abilities are either totally under govern-
ment control or are on the run from government agents who seek to
impose these controls on them.
 Ridiculed and denied: Only those in the know are aware of the exis-
tence of paranormal abilities beyond normal human ability; everyone
else has been indoctrinated to completely disbelieve even the evidence
of their own senses. Anyone who claims to have seen a demonstration of
a paranormal ability is labeled delusional and is subject to social or legal
sanctions. The most common scenario for this situation is a “Secret
Masters” campaign in which the people with the paranormal abilities are
secretly in control of nearly every aspect of society.
 Completely unknown: For some reason, nobody is aware of the exis-
tence of these paranormal abilities. No, really. Not even the government.
Even the local folklore doesn’t have anything to say about it. This would
lead to a lonely and paranoid existence; the characters who had such
abilities would have next to no hope of ever finding someone else like
them or of getting someone to teach them how to use their abilities
wisely and safely. Intelligent people would do everything possible to
keep anyone else from ever finding out about their abilities, lest they
become guinea pigs for power-hungry tyrants.
You may want to think of these seven options as a continuum and fit your game
world somewhere in the middle of two of the choices we’ve given you here.
How common are paranormal abilities?
This is different from the previous question, which was about public knowl-
edge. Something can be kept very secret and still be a common occurrence.
On the other hand, when something extremely rare occurs, it is probably
going to make the evening news and be discussed around every water cooler
the next day. You could run a campaign in which the people who do not have
paranormal abilities are the distinct minority (and are viewed as pitiful crip-
ples), or you can create a world in which people with paranormal abilities are
a statistically nonexistent anomaly. More likely, you will choose something
more middle-of-the-road.
282
Part V: Building Your Own World 

An interesting exercise is to create a graph using the possible answers to this
question and the previous question as the X and Y axes and to chart the pos-
sible social climate you would create for your campaign based upon how
these two decisions interact in your game world.
What are the upper levels of power?
When deciding on the limits of powers in your campaign, you ought to con-
sider both the practical level and the absolute level. The practical level is the
reasonable degree of skill and “wattage” that a person with these abilities can
hope to achieve. The absolute level is the most powerful (mortal) NPC you’re
willing to create for this world. This defines what your player characters are
going to hope to achieve (the absolute) and what they can actually attain
(the practical).
Are you willing to consider running a campaign in which the PCs can aspire
to Godhood? Or are you more comfortable with a campaign in which even the
most powerful practitioner is little more than a prestidigitator with a good
stage crew? Or were you thinking somewhere in between? Your decision on
this issue will help you determine the campaign’s starting level and help you
determine the answers to the questions in the sections that follow.
Will you make any modifications to 
the paranormal abilities you allow?
You can substantially personalize your campaign by making one or more
modifications to the way that paranormal abilities work in your game world.
You can create new abilities, like Bjoern did with the Land Rule Power in
Avonlea. You can also add restrictions on the way powers can be used, or
have some means of augmenting the use of powers, or all of the above.
GURPS already has some of these restrictions or augmentations built into the
system, and we talk about a lot of them in this very book. Check out Chapter
7 for some pointers on how these work with the GURPS magic system, and
Chapter 8 addresses the enhancements and limitations on the use of the
other types of powers.
Just because the system has limits and controls in place doesn’t mean you
can’t add to them (or subtract from them), if it suits the designs of your game
world. Manipulating the system in this way makes your campaign much more
memorable for everyone involved. In his Avonlea campaign, Bjoern liked to
use what he calls his caged-carrot approach; he would hold out the carrot of
some tremendously powerful ability and then put it in a cage of limitations
and restrictions so that it was either unwieldy, frustrating, or unpalatable
to use (and sometimes all three), and the characters would really have to
283
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

decide if the hassle and the cost to use the ability was worth the benefit of
the ability. Not only does this approach make things more interesting, but it
helps maintain game balance.
The following list is a partial list of some ways you can modify the use of
paranormal abilities to make your campaign just that much different than the
next GM’s, along with examples of how Bjoern may have used it in Avonlea.
 Impose racial restrictions or bonuses: Bjoern imposed several racially-
based limitations on psionic-powered humans in Avonlea; he determined
that humans absolutely could not have either Psychokinesis or Telepor-
tation. He also determined that most human psionics were still partially
latent and required the use of special crystals to access the full scope of
their abilities. These crystals could be found only in a distant and dan-
gerous land and were rare even there, so gaining access to these crys-
tals became a significant motivator for most psionic characters. He also
determined that, for humans, powers required specific advantages —
also known as latencies. In order to take a power, human characters had
to first take advantages that Bjoern determined would be latencies for
that power, (such as Empathy for Telepathy, Danger Sense for ESP, and
so on); these points could be translated into active psi abilities, and the
players could use the points saved from limitations only on those abili-
ties, or specific power-related disadvantages, to take higher power levels.
This created a significant bar on how powerful any given human could
start out being.
 Include knowledge-based limitations and enhancements: Much of the
focus of the Avonlea campaign is on the struggle to regain lost knowl-
edge. Mage characters start out with access to a severely restricted list of
available spells and can learn spells outside of that list only if they can
locate that spell during the course of adventuring. (This has an added
bonus of preventing any mages from knowing spells that the GM doesn’t
want to have used until and unless he decides to allow the party to have
them.) However, if a character has the guts (or stupidity) to bargain with
an Old One (see the section, “Deciding on Deity,” earlier in this chapter),
he might be granted the knowledge of a previously unknown spell; but
possibly at the cost of his soul . . .
 Include energetic limitations and enhancements: Avonlea is a low-mana
environment. This means that all spell use is not only at –5 to use, but
powerstones take significantly longer to recharge, and mages have to
know the Recover Energy spell at a level of 20 before it will benefit them.
This puts a significant damper on the effectiveness of mages in battle and
prevents the profligate use of magical energy on trivial matters. But then
Bjoern added a caged carrot that allows mages to use Energy Spells to
284
Part V: Building Your Own World 

tap into and draw upon the ambient mana in the environment, but only
in certain locations called ley lines and mana wells. This turned the locat-
ing and exploitation of the ley lines and mana wells into a preoccupation
for all mage characters and spawned many different plot scenarios.
 Include ideological limitations and enhancements: Perhaps the most
significant limitation that Bjoern imposed on all users of paranormal
abilities (any paranormal ability) in Avonlea is based upon the ethical
strictures of the different religions to be found in that world. He set up a
system that punishes any character for using paranormal abilities in any
capacity that violates the principles of the ethical system. Any inappro-
priate use of a paranormal ability stains the aura of the character and
has a chance of attracting the attention of the deities and servants of the
opposing ethical system. The more a character’s aura is stained, the
greater the chance that the enemy will notice her activity. This leads to
packs of vile Fell Wolves chasing after the party and means that they
were more likely to catch the Evil that was supposed to be asleep in the
ruins they need to explore while it is “between naps.”
What were some of the ways these ethical strictures could be violated?
That is unique to the campaign, but in Avonlea the Powers of the Light
generally demand that its followers confront their foes face-to-face,
never harm an unarmed or innocent person, and never deprive another
being of its free will. This means that it is okay to use one’s Invisibility
spell to escape the clutches of one’s foes, but it could call the attention
of a much greater enemy if you use that same spell to sneak up and stick
a dagger in an opponent’s back. It means that, although it is perfectly
fine to fry your enemies with a Lightning Bolt, using any ability that 
controls their minds, bodies, or emotions creates an auric stain that
no bleach can get out, because doing so affects the free choices each
being is allowed to make. 
It also means that the forces of evil (who know full well the prohibitions
the good guys have to operate under) will quite happily drop their
weapons and surrender if the battle starts going against them because
they know they can’t be harmed if they are unarmed. And yes, in some
cases, the party had to fight the same foes time after time because the
bad guys kept surrendering and the party had to let them go free.
Listening to the players groan and swear when they’d realize that they
were having to face Eduin Haldar yet again always filled Bjoern with glee.
As you can see, by coming up with a few simple rules, you can tailor how any
paranormal ability is limited or enhanced in your game world so that it is
uniquely yours and will stick in the memories of your players for years 
afterward.
285
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

How can paranormal abilities 
be improved?
How you answer this question depends on what you want out of the cam-
paign and how you answered the previous question about power levels. If
you want to keep the power level of your campaign within shouting distance
of how it started out, you should either severely restrict any increase in
strength (but not skill) level, or make it very difficult or expensive to do so,
or both. If, however, you want a campaign to start out relatively weak and
then let it grow until the party becomes a force that will make the deities
tremble in fear, then you have to make advancing in power level as easy as
possible — and be generous with the experience points.
Whatever you decide, it must be a policy that is fair, can be administered
equally among all players, and is internally consistent. If it isn’t, players will
scheme to find loopholes around your rules, obnoxiously whine about your
capriciousness, and fight amongst themselves if they have any reason to
think (whether it’s accurate or not) that you’re playing favorites.
Putting it all together
Once again, now that you have determined the general answers to the six pri-
mary questions about paranormal abilities in your game world, you need to
go back and expand on each of your answers until you establish a unified,
internally consistent, and comprehensive set of guidelines. We have just a
few quick observations for you to consider before we move on to the topic of
world development.
 The more types of paranormal abilities that you make available in your
campaign, the more complex and difficult that campaign will be for 
the GM.
 The more types of paranormal abilities that you make available in your
campaign, the greater your versatility and flexibility in your ability 
to come up with different and exciting scenarios for your parties to 
deal with.
 Whatever decision you make about the societal implications of the use
of paranormal abilities, there will be unforeseen and unintended conse-
quences for you to deal with.
 Be judicious in your application of limitations and enhancements on the
use of paranormal abilities; you want to make the campaign fun, and
maybe even a little confusing (to people newly introduced to your
world, at least), but you don’t want to hamstring your players’ charac-
ters too severely. If you do, the players will lose interest in both the char-
acters and the campaign.
286
Part V: Building Your Own World 

 The greater the strength of paranormal abilities in any campaign, the
greater the chance that it will throw the game balance out of whack.
 Keeping the players — and their characters — a little “hungry” is better
than letting them “fill up” on whatever paranormal abilities may be avail-
able. Hungry characters are more motivated to jump into adventures
that hold out the promise of meager rewards than full players are moti-
vated to jump into adventures that promise everything under the sun.
 It is a Law of Nature, as reliable and unbeatable as gravity, that no
matter what a paranormal ability is or what you intended it to be used
for, the players will find some way to use it to screw up your campaign.
Get over it and adapt; ad-lib as needed.
Tackling the Terrors of Technology
The third and final law of the physics of your game world is what technology
is available and what is possible. This establishes the basis of the tech level
(TL) of your campaign. Keep in mind that you don’t have to decide that the
TL of your campaign is necessarily the absolute level of your game world; but
you do need to decide what types of technology exist and what is possible
and what is impossible. Deciding this in advance makes your job so much
easier in determining the results — and possible consequences — when some
wiseacre player figures out a way to argue that her character ought to be
allowed to invent gunpowder in what is supposed to be a Bronze Age campaign.
Remember, you determine how the physical laws are applied in your campaign;
with the above example, you may determine that in your game world the chem-
ical mixture that we know as gunpowder does not combust when exposed to
heat — perhaps it dissolves into a sticky, gooey mess instead.
Making decisions about technology in your game world is usually a lot easier
than decisions about deities and powers, unless you decided to include no
deities and powers at all. You can simply choose the tech level from the list
on page 511 of GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns that matches your vision for the
campaign. This gives you a basic level that can be applied across the board
in all areas of technology. Or, you can do some personalization by creating a
split tech level, turning to page 512 of that book and using the “Tech Levels
by Field” sidebar instead. If you are considering advanced technology
(beyond what we experience in the world today), we recommend that you
check out Chapter 9, “Tackling Tech Level,” to get the skinny on a lot of the
technological issues in GURPS.
Depending upon the nature of the campaign and the history you give to your
game world, you can create an interesting scenario in which a society has
one consistent tech level in all areas except for one specific technology that is
either substantially advanced from the norm or significantly behind the
norm. Consider the societies in fantasy literature that are still in TL3 except
287
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

for their flight technology, or their use of some kind of ray gun. Now, think of
the alternative; imagine a version of 21st-century North America in a world
that never invented gunpowder, TNT, or any equivalent explosive propellant
that could be used to create firearms. The point we’re trying to make is that
you should keep your options open and your imagination active. Those are
the only limits to your campaign — well, that and the ability of players to
create bizarre situations that have consequences no sane GM could ever
anticipate.
Arthur C. Clarke said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguish-
able from magic.” This is something that you need to keep in mind; the higher
the TL of your campaign, the more its technology is going to duplicate feats
that otherwise only people with paranormal abilities have any hope of
achieving, but with one notable difference: Technology allows anyone to
achieve the near-miraculous. Think about it: After you’ve hit TL5, any idiot
who puts a point into the Guns (Rifle) skill and has the $200 to afford a car-
tridge rifle has the potential to inflict as much or more damage (5d) as most
mages who have spent upwards of 50 points learning how to cast Fireballs.
Technology is a lot less easily controlled by the GM than paranormal abilities.
In any campaign, it’s unlikely that the party will ever have access to magic
items or advanced spells that you haven’t put in their path. In a campaign
with technology, however, it is difficult for a GM to come up with a rationale
that can keep the players from buying anything that is available in the open
market. And money is a lot easier to come by than experience points!
Regardless of what you decide on for tech level, you ought to consider cer-
tain issues in anticipation of how you will respond to some of the situations
that you may have to face in your career as GM.
 No matter how many times you tell them otherwise, some players
absolutely refuse to believe that some modern technologies cannot be
reproduced in a low-tech setting.
 You can have such a thing as too much realism. Regardless of how much
the Reconstructionist societies try to romanticize it, by modern standards,
life in the past was not just unpleasant, it was nasty. If you’re running a low-
tech campaign, you don’t need to make your players deal with the realities
of chamberpots, open running sewers, and no antibiotics.
 You should develop a strategy for how you will deal with the fact that
the higher the tech level, the more likely it is that a single successful
attack will result in the loss of more Hit Points than any normal charac-
ter can hope to live through.
 If you create a campaign that involves both a high tech level and high
levels of paranormal ability (especially magic), how are you going to
deal with the interaction of technology and those paranormal abilities?
For example, are the Missile Shield and Reverse Missile spells going to
be effective against beam weapons?
288
Part V: Building Your Own World 

We’ve addressed just a few of the issues you need to think about, but you
probably get the idea. Again, don’t worry about having right or wrong
answers in your decisions about technology for your campaign, just so long
as you think through some of the ramifications of your decisions.
Considering Culture
Nearly every GM spends at least some time addressing the physical laws of
her game world (perhaps not to the level of detail that we’re encouraging),
but she more often tends to give the “social laws” a short shrift. We urge you
not to do that. In many ways, the social organization of your game world is
even more important that the physical laws; it’s usually of more immediate
concern to most people, and most players seem to be more rigid in their
social thinking than in their acceptance of different physical realities.
Make the strange seem normal
In our experience, most players can more readily adapt to the idea of a world
in which bubble gum makes the best ammunition for firearms or a world in
which superheroes with super-powers that can shatter mountains go begging
for work by advertising in the local weekly newspaper than the same players
can adapt to radically different cultures; say for example, a culture with no
concept of “family,” where all children are raised in crèches, and where all
social and political advances are based strictly on merit and not on inheri-
tance. In Chapter 21, we talk about crafting a mood to your campaign to hook
the players’ emotions into the action; the things we talk about here are the
first steps to use toward crafting a mood in your game world.
Creating a society that is subtly dissimilar (or bizarrely similar) to reality can
make the biggest dent in breaking down the players’ expectations, exposing
them to strange and peculiar concepts that throw them off-balance. Overall
they can become better players because of it.
The party that played in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign had a difficult time
coming to terms with the ambitions of the Land Rulers, who murdered their
fathers to inherit their domains, who fought tooth-and-nail to retain their
positions against all challengers, and who knew that their own sons would
kill them before they turned 50. At first, some of the players couldn’t come to
grips with someone who would still aspire for the job enough to fight to keep
it. Other players had problems with the concept of a society that not only
sanctioned patricide but rewarded the murderous sons with the greatest
power levels and the highest social status attainable in the society. Playing in
this campaign forced these players to stretch themselves outside their com-
fort zones, and eventually they became ardent supporters of the social struc-
ture they once found so bizarre.
289
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

Again, the decision of how your society is structured is totally up to you.
You’ve probably already had your inspiration for the campaign and know
what sort of game world you’re creating, and you probably already have a
good idea of what kind of society the players will find themselves in as well.
But you probably don’t have more than a nebulous idea of how it’s organized
beyond (for example) “an egalitarian interstellar democracy,” or have
thought about how people live, what their dreams are, or the true sources of
the conflicts in your society.
Like in the earlier sections of this chapter, we ask you to consider a few ques-
tions, decide how you want to answer each question for your campaign, and
then take those answers and flesh out the details in your own gaming notes.
Don’t let the length of the following lists scare you or put you off; you can
always choose to ignore a particular question and answer it only if you feel
moved to define its issue.
We divide these questions into three basic categories and provide a brief
description of the Avonlea society in each category to give you a frame of ref-
erence for the questions that follow.
Social organization
Avonlea’s basic unit of social organization is the Garth, a settlement in which
several families from the three distinct castes live and work in the same
dwelling but stay distinctly separate from each other. The three castes in the
society are Peasants (workers), Nobles (warriors), and Kindred (with the
Power of the Land Rule). Each caste lives distinctly different lives side-by-
side, and movement between the castes is extraordinarily rare.
The kinship structure is patrilineal; children belong to their father’s clan. The
clan is the central institution of the social structure; every person, regardless
of social status, belongs to a clan that sees to his well-being. Marriage is
strictly exogamous (outside of one’s own clan) but is kept within the bounds
of one’s own caste; cross-caste relationships are harshly punished. Women
live with their husbands but retain membership in their father’s clans.
The Kindred caste practices polygamy; a man takes one sealed wife for life
but may have any number of contract wives, primarily to produce children to
cement an alliance between clans. When the contract expires, the contract
wife returns to her own clan, leaving behind her children, but with a hefty
bride price that she can use to enhance her own dowry for an honorable
sealed marriage later on.
Women have the primary responsibility for raising children, but after a child
turns seven, that child is usually fostered to the wife’s clan for part of each
year. The foster family takes on the responsibility of educating the child in
what she has to know as an adult.
290
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Literacy in Avonlea is relatively uncommon; most Peasants have no need to
know how to read, and few warriors of the Nobility do, either. Literacy is
common only among the Kindred and those members of the Nobility who
have chosen a scholastic or mercantile life over a martial one.
Ethically, Avonlea is an honor- or shame-based (rather than guilt-based) soci-
ety that values honesty, forthrightness, free will, and facing danger squarely
without qualm. A person’s honor is his most important possession and is
something that is shared with the entire clan. The primary ethical strictures
of Avonlea society are based upon maintaining the honor of the clan; any
person who acts in a way that is publicly recognized as “dishonorable” stains
the name of his entire clan, and if that person refuses to make reparations for
his dishonorable behavior and eliminate the stain, it is up to the clan to do so
on his behalf.
Disputes are settled by a code duello, and every adult, male or female, is
expected to enforce his or her own rights by challenging to a duel anyone
who has wronged him. This code duello can range from individual battles to
clan wars that involve every member of the clan or clans on each side.
Avonlea’s history is full of these wars, and many clans have become extinct
as a result.
Now that you have an example from Avonlea, think about the game world
you’re creating while you answer the following questions:
 What is the basic unit of social organization in your game world?
 What is the basis for determining kinship in your game world?
 What central institution maintains your game world’s social structure?
 What is the nature of the relationship between the sexes?
 Is there more than one human ethnicity in your game world? If so, what
is the nature of the relationship between the different ethnicities?
 Are there intelligent nonhumans in your game world? If so, what is the
nature of their relationship with humans?
 Who has primary responsibility to rear and nurture the children?
 Who has the responsibility to educate the youth?
 What is the standard level of education in your game world?
 How does society treat the elderly, the infirm, and the disabled?
 What are the moral and/or ethical strictures in society?
 How is social conformity enforced?
 Are there stratified social classes? If so, what are they?
 Is advancement (or demotion) between social levels possible?
291
Chapter 18: Setting the Stage for Your World

Economics
The economy of Avonlea is primarily agrarian, and food production is the
work emphasis of over 80 percent of the population. Most of this work is the
responsibility of the Peasant caste, but the Kindred caste also uses its Land
Rule Powers to enhance the fertility and prosperity of the fields. Even though
the Peasants do most of the work, the land is owned by the local Land Ruler,
who appoints subordinates in the Kindred as Landed Knights to administer
individual Garths and manage their resources. In return, the Landed Knights
owe the Land Rulers rent and taxes, which are used to pay for the production
of any manufactured goods that the Garths can’t produce themselves.
Avonlea has not advanced to the point at which the concept of “money” has
relevance; merchants use trade goods and specie (gold, silver, and jewels that
are valued by weight) to manage their businesses. Most of the transactions
within and between Garths are based upon barter — frequently with the
promise of a day’s labor as one medium of exchange.
Avonlea is a fairly poor society economically. Most of the surplus food pro-
duced by the Peasants goes to support the Kindred and the Nobility. The
Kindred do contribute by using their Land Rule Powers to increase crop
yields by as much as 400 percent, but muscle-based technologies can culti-
vate only as much land as they have workers to do the labor. The Nobility are
a class of professional warriors who have the job of keeping both Kindred
and Peasant safe from attack by rival clans, rival domains, outlaw raiders,
and the forces of evil that still plague the land. If peace could be brought to
Avonlea, the Dalesmen would be able to build their population and techno-
logical bases and start achieving real prosperity.
Using this general outline of Avonlea’s economics as an example, consider
these questions as you think about your game world’s money matters:
 What is the economic basis of your game world?
 Who does most of the work in your game world, and who profits most
from it?
 What determines wealth in your game world?
 How are wealth and resources redistributed within your game world?
 What is the basis of economic exchange in your game world?
 How is property and wealth transferred between generations?
 How is surplus production used in your game world?
 What role do “non-producers” play in the society?
 What role does trade play in your game world’s economy?
 Are there corporations or other rich, powerful organizations in your
game world?
 Has your game world advanced beyond a scarcity-based economy?
292
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Political and legal structure
Avonlea is primarily feudal in nature, with no centralized authority. Each
clan is ruled by a Clan Lord who is the strongest member of the Kindred
in that clan (determined by a combination of factors, such as strength
of Land Rule Power, economic clout, number of armed followers, and 
reputation), who claims the allegiance of all members of the clan and
acknowledges no higher authority aside from the collective deities known
as the High Ones.
The clan is not the only political structure in Avonlea; not everyone in a clan
lives and works under the authority of an overlord of the same clan. War,
intermarriage, and migration have caused people to live and work in Dales
and Garths owned and ruled by members of different clans, and each individ-
ual owes allegiance to his local Land Ruler, regardless of clan, as well. This
can result in tension due to potentially conflicting loyalties if one’s clan goes
to war with the clan of one’s Land Ruler.
Each Land Ruler achieves his status by killing his predecessor and taking
the Land Rule Power from him; usually, this is the case of a son killing
his father with the sanction of society, but anyone of the Kindred who
can wield the Land Rule has the right to challenge a Land Ruler to a duel
to the death. This means that each Land Ruler tends to view all of his
peers, their sons, and any other members of the Kindred with the strength
to hold the full power of the Land Rule with suspicion and mistrust, and he
fortifies his Domains and forbids any unallied adults of the Kindred to enter
into his lands.
The only unifying authorities between clans and domains are the three reli-
gions in Avonlea, along with the secular Orders of the Sisterhood of Wisdom,
and the Seers and Guardians of Starlight. In their own way, each of these orga-
nizations provides links that keep the different demands of political alle-
giance from getting out of hand, and when an outside threat arises, they are
able to mobilize the different clans and domains to create a unified front until
the threat abates.
Keeping the example of Avonlea in mind, answer these questions about poli-
tics in your game world:
 What is the basis of political authority in your game world?
 How is political authority transferred?
 Who has the authority to enforce the laws in your game world?
 How are laws enforced?
 How are disputes settled?
 What institution or institutions keep your society together?

Putting it all together
Now that you have answered each of these questions, use your answers to
create a more detailed description of the culture that is the backdrop of your
campaign. You may find that some of your decisions are incompatible with
others. That’s okay; you can change your mind, or you can figure out a way to
make the two conflicting issues work together. (After all, no one has ever
claimed that human society is entirely logical or internally consistent.)
With a little bit of work, you’ll have a detailed and unique culture for your
campaign that will keep your players involved from start to finish.

I
f you’ve read through Chapters 17 and 18, you have all the physical and
cultural concerns about your campaign figured out. But you still don’t
have your campaign ready to go yet. You need to develop even more detail
about your world — and these details put you a definite step closer to having
a campaign for your party of eager players.
After you have developed the general information about your game world
and determined the type of campaign you want to run, you need to get an
idea of your world’s geography — the simplest way to do that is to develop
maps, which you can use as the basis for your descriptions. Later on, you’ll
need to make smaller-scale maps of the areas in which your campaign will
take place, especially the floor plans of the dungeons your party will be
adventuring in. (Please note that throughout this chapter we use the term
dungeon generically to mean any adventuring location.) Because you need to
make sure that all the necessary locations for your campaign are represented
on your maps, this is the time to start figuring out what sort of plotline you
envision for your campaign, a process that includes determining the types of
clues and plot devices you are going to utilize. This chapter deals with all of
these essential issues for putting your very own campaign together.
Developing and Managing a Plotline
We mention throughout this book that role playing is a process of shared sto-
rytelling, and any good story needs a plot behind the action. Bjoern’s mother
and Adam’s father are both professors of English literature (you can send
your sympathy cards c/o the publisher of this fine volume). This means that

the criteria for developing good plots, information that most of you had the
luxury of sleeping through in your high school lit classes, is probably
encoded in our DNA. But if you’re going to create a sustainable plotline for
your campaign, this information will actually prove helpful. 
Crafting a basic plot
When boiled down to their bare essentials, all good plots can be identified by
the Three Cs: Choices, Conflict, and Consequences.
Choices
In any plot of any story, whether it’s a short story, a novel, or your campaign,
the primary characters are confronted with making one or more choices. The
choices they make are caused by or result in conflict, or both. These choices
can be as mundane as what they’re going to have for breakfast or as significant
as deciding to toss a piece of tawdry jewelry into a volcano.
Your first concern in developing a plot for your campaign is creating a sce-
nario that forces your party with one or more choices that they must make to
address the situation you’ve presented. You need to decide what choice or
choices will move the campaign in the right direction (and be sure to include
adequate clues to this effect in the campaign’s scenario), what choices will
have detrimental consequences for the party, and what choices you need to
find ways to steer the party clear of so that your campaign isn’t derailed.
Conflict
In some of the dreary drivel that’s passed off as literature, this conflict is
sometimes completely internal to the psychology of the character, but this is
generally not the case in role playing. In a GURPS campaign, the conflicts the
characters face are due to external influences (in the form of NPCs or other
player characters) interacting directly with them. When creating your plot-
line, determine what types of conflict the party could face for each choice
they are likely to make.
Keep in mind that not all conflict must be combat. Negotiating a trade agree-
ment is a type of conflict; in some cases, going out to a singles’ bar could be
considered a type of conflict. All that is really needed for “conflict” is for two
or more parties to have incompatible interests. The resolution of the conflict
could result in severed heads or in learning how to peacefully coexist; it all
depends on the campaign. This is the bulk of the work in preparing the cam-
paign. You need to create the NPCs who are allied with the party and NPCs
who are antagonistic to the party and then determine their likely responses
to the different choices the party could make.

Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting
A gothic vampire-hunter plotline
To quickly illustrate how these 10 steps work
together to create a plotline, imagine that you’re
preparing a classic “gothic vampire-hunter”
campaign. Here’s how it might play out in the
sequence that the players will experience it:
1. Setting the stage and scene with Allies and
background characters. The party is a
random assortment of travelers who coin-
cidentally arrive in a remote Carpathian vil-
lage on the same day and they all stay in the
village’s sole inn. That evening, a band of
ruffians attack the inn with the intent of rob-
bing the travelers, forcing the group to band
together to fight off the attack, coinciden-
tally saving the life and livelihood of a mer-
chant who is a prominent member of the
village’s ruling council. In gratitude, the
merchant pays for a week’s lodging in the
village for the party, which gives them time
to get to know each other and to become
acquainted with the villagers.
2. Present the party with a problem. Soon
they discover that there are more problems
in this little hamlet than just the ruffians.
They hear rumors of children disappearing
out of their beds, and one morning they
wake up to discover that the young daugh-
ter of the innkeeper has gone missing.
3. The conundrum. The villagers are all con-
vinced that the disappearances are the
responsibility of a “night-walking Nosfer-
atu,” a creature that the sophisticated party
members know does not exist. (They 
know this because the GM has told them —
using the PCs skill-sets to convey this 
information — that such creatures don’t
exist in this world.)
4. The encouragement and another Ally. The
innkeeper tearfully begs the party to track
down the night-walker and rescue his
daughter because he knows that she’ll be
kept alive until the night of the next full
moon, and the merchant offers to cover
their expenses and introduces them to a
local guide.
5. The pot-o’-gold and dungeon. Because they
are decent sorts, the party investigates and
begins collecting stories about the
Nosferatu. They discover that legends say
that the Nosferatu dwells in a castle in the
mountains that has the collected treasures
of several centuries’ worth of victims, and
that the treasure would be the property of
anyone who kills the creature.
6. The mini-minds and minions. The party
begins exploring the mountains, unaware
that the Nosferatu has servants guarding
the approaches to his lair who are power-
ful in their own right, and each servant com-
mands a group of skeletons.
7. The Mastermind and climax. The party
fights its way to the castle and confronts the
Nosferatu. In a bloody battle, they finally
destroy the creature, end its reign of terror,
and rescue the innkeeper’s daughter.
8. The theme and scale. They do find the Nos-
feratu’s treasure hoard and leave rich, tri-
umphantly returning the girl to her parents,
only to learn that the Nosferatu is not dead.
Such an evil can be permanently killed only
by a few very special means, and anyone
who steals from it will become Nosferatu
after the full turning of the moon, unless he
finds a way to bring an end to the creature
once and for all. They’d better hurry!

Consequences
A consequence doesn’t have to be negative. Winning a bucket full of power-
stones is a consequence — just one you want to prevent your party from
ever getting. In terms of your plot, every conflict the party faces will include
consequences for the player characters. These consequences may then
require the characters to make new choices, which results in a new conflict
with its own consequences, and so on.
Creating a plot in ten easy steps
Now that you have the “Three C’s” of plot development in your conscious-
ness, here are the steps that you need to walk through to develop your plots.
For an example of how these steps relate to an actual plot, see the sidebar,
“A gothic vampire-hunter plotline.”
1. Create your world.
Chapters 17 and 18, as well as the “Basic Cartography” section (later in
this chapter), can help you create your game world. You need to do this
in order to create a “brief” for your players to create their characters.
2. Set the scale.
How much territory do you think your campaign will cover? A single
city? A small country? A continent? A few solar systems? You need to set
the scale of your initial map to allow for the full scope of your campaign.
To do this you need to answer the following questions:
• How long do you want this plotline to continue? Is this an adven-
ture that you want the party to be able to resolve in one or two
nights of play, or do you want to create an epic plot arc spanning
months of play?
• Do you want this to be a single, ongoing plot or a series of subplots,
mini-adventures, and side trips that eventually lead to a conclusion?
• How important is the plot to the game world?
3. Choose a theme.
This could also be considered the “moral of the story.” No, you don’t
have to have a theme for your campaign, but having one helps the GM
stay focused while creating the campaign and provides a “compass” for
the party, even when they’re not consciously aware of it. You can have a
single theme for your plot, one great theme with several subthemes, or a
series of small themes that are only nebulously connected.
298
Part V: Building Your Own World 

For example, in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign, he used the subthemes of
recovering lost knowledge, balancing the needs of self-determination for
each individual against the needs of the social contract, and the need to
sacrifice one’s own well-being in order to oppose oppression. But the
greater theme of Avonlea is the ultimate imperative to take responsibil-
ity for the consequences of all of one’s actions, whether intentional or
unintentional.
Heavy stuff, and not suitable for all campaigns. However, some fairly stan-
dard “boilerplate” themes are the staple of science fiction and heroic
fantasy fiction: the essential futility of evil; the destructiveness of greed,
selfishness, or hatred; the value of personal freedom; and so on. Even if
you don’t deliberately choose a theme for your campaign, the chances
are that in the future, when looking back on your campaign, you may be
able to identify a unifying theme that ran through all of the adventures.
4. Create the climax.
You want to start at the very end of the campaign and how you envision
the conclusion of the plotline. The plotline’s climax could see your party
doing any number of things, such as
• Unmasking the killer
• Driving the alien invaders from your game world’s soil
• Finding the lost Toilet Brush of the Elder Gods
• Repairing the damage caused by past mistakes and “patching” the
dimensional rift in the fabric of the universe, as is the case with
Avonlea
When you know how you want the campaign to end, you can start work-
ing backward toward the beginning. When you have determined the
climax, you can figure out what steps will be needed to achieve the con-
clusion, what essential clues the party must find, and any other criteria
that are needed to get to that point. (Later on, you’ll be able to deter-
mine when and how you convey this information to your party.)
5. Create the enemy NPCs.
Chapter 20 handles this topic in detail, so check it out. But at this point,
you want to create your enemy NPCs in three discrete tiers:
• The Mastermind: The Mastermind is the character who is the ulti-
mate cause of the situation that the party must confront, usually
(but not always) the leader of the forces opposing the party’s
actions. At this point, you are best served if you create your
Mastermind as a fully-developed NPC, even though your PCs are
probably not going to meet him/her/it for a long time. If you do
this, you’ll better understand this character’s psychology and
motivations and be better able to decide how this character will
respond to the PCs’ actions during the campaign.
299
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

• The mini-minds: Mini-minds — the lesser villains who do the
Mastermind’s bidding — also ought to be created as fully-developed
and realized characters at this time — at least the first several
mini-minds you plan on throwing at the party. If you are planning
an extremely long-term plotline, you can hold off developing the
ones the party won’t encounter for quite a while, but you should
at least have an idea (perhaps a list of names and one-sentence
descriptions) of who the Mastermind’s lieutenants and agents are.
Naturally, you can always add to this list at any time during the
campaign’s progress. 
• The minions: Minions are the faceless, nameless characters who
can be created en masse (through the use of a template) and who
typically exist to serve the Mastermind’s will.
6. Develop your dungeons.
Again, a lot of the detail work of this step can be done as the campaign
progresses, and you need to complete only the first dungeon or two the
party will adventure in before the start of the campaign. However, we’ve
found that it is extremely helpful to draw up a list of the different dun-
geons that your party will encounter as part of the plotline — as well as
what you expect them to gain (in terms of knowledge, treasure, and clues)
from each. If you have more than a couple of dungeons ready to go at the
start of the campaign, you have the liberty of presenting the party with a
number of options to choose from, which makes the players feel less con-
strained by GM whim and more in control of their character’s destinies.
7. Create the other NPCs.
Only the smallest-scale campaigns can work without the party finding
NPC Allies who assist the party in pursuing the plotline. Again, Chapter
20 talks about creating Ally NPCs; check out that chapter for information
about how to create Allies as well as bystanders.
Primarily, you need to consider at this point whether the party will have
any Patrons — who may drive the plotline by assigning tasks to the party
or may provide the party with initial or ongoing resources — and Allies —
who adventure with the party, essentially acting as a GM-controlled player
character. These will be the most important NPCs from the party’s per-
spective, but there are certainly many other categories of NPC Allies
that you need to develop — anything from the various Ally NPCs that
the individual player characters have paid character points to get
(Contacts, Allies, individually or in groups) to the proprietor of the local
inn where the party stays between adventures, and who acts as the
party’s “fence” for all their ill-gotten gains.
Whether it’s the tavern maid with the infectious grin or the asteroid
miner who knows every off-color joke in the solar system, don’t forget
the background characters; these can oftentimes become some of the
most compelling components of any campaign, even if they’re not
directly involved with the plotline. These NPCs add color and a sense of
300
Part V: Building Your Own World 

realism and provide the characters with a chance for interactions that
aren’t fraught with portent and meaning. Or are they? Sometimes you
can include background characters and mislead the party into thinking
that they are significant to the plot, or hide significant NPCs amongst the
local color. If you have a campaign in which the forces of evil threaten
the lives and souls of ordinary people, providing characters with person-
ality that the party can get to know before they disappear or are threat-
ened adds a deeper emotional component to the plot than just causing
mayhem amongst faceless masses.
8. Add a pinch of conundrum and a cupful of encouragement into a 
pot-o’-gold.
Most campaigns have at least one mystery that the party has to solve
(the conundrum). This can be the goal of the campaign, such as finding
the identity of the serial killer, or it can be an integral part of achieving
the goal, such as breaking the secret code on the treasure map. The mys-
tery may not even really be necessary to completing the campaign —
such as identifying “Sir Strongarm” as Neil Armstrong — or it can be
completely tangential to the purposes of the plot but be a lot of fun
anyway. You get to decide. You don’t necessarily need a mystery in your
campaign, but you may lose the interest of some of your more intellec-
tual players if you don’t.
We also find that some players (and hence their characters) require
some kind of motivation (the encouragement) to induce them to start on
an adventure, especially if the scenario that the GM presents is obvi-
ously dangerous. Simply presenting these players with a chance for
adventure — and even treasure — isn’t enough; there has to be some
lure, some hook, or some goad that compels the PC to get involved. 
Finally, some players expect to find or achieve some kind of great reward
at the end of a campaign (the pot-o’-gold). This is different than the moti-
vation; motivations are sometimes necessary to get the party going on
an adventure. The rewards are sometimes necessary to keep the party
on track in the adventure. Typical rewards for campaigns are the promise
of a title or sovereignty over some territory, or the eradication of some
great evil — although for plotlines that have a smaller scope, gaining
control of a particular street gang, or paying off the mortgage on a tramp
space-freighter may be sufficient promise to keep the action going.
9. Present the party with a problem.
The plotline of a campaign may start with the party being confronted
with a problem that they are asked to solve. For example, this problem
could be the peculiar disappearance of the tritium ore shipments (and
the party is hired to investigate), or it could begin with the mysterious
disappearance of local villagers. Whether or not the problem is actually
connected with the greater plotline — or if it is merely a means of get-
ting the party involved in a scenario so that you can introduce them to
yet another problem that will lead into the greater plotline — is up to you.
301
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

In general, if you’re planning a campaign with a long and convoluted
plotline, we recommend that you get the party started with an issue or
problem that is either tangential or not associated with the greater plot.
This creates an “introductory” period for the players to get used to their
characters and for the party to become more cohesive before being
thrown into the more serious situation.
10. Set the stage and the scene.
You could consider this to be the “opening movement” of your cam-
paign. You have already decided on where the campaign will take place,
now you need to fit the party of PCs into it. Is the campaign going to take
place in their hometown or in one they just wandered into? Do the
player characters have established relationships and histories with each
other (a tack which seems to be rarely taken but can be effective, espe-
cially if the players have gamed together for a long time), or are they
going to meet and form the party during these opening sessions? (This
is much more common; the “classic” means of bringing a party together
is the “tavern brawl” that they are all drawn into “accidentally.”)
Yes, we have had you work up your campaign in reverse order from how it
will be played, and if you follow our instructions in the sequence we’ve sug-
gested, you’ll thank us for it later.
Keeping the Party on Track
Trust us when we say that if your party has a chance of getting side-tracked,
they will probably take it and run with it. We think that the most difficult part
of GMing is keeping the party going in the right direction and not jumping
ahead to where they shouldn’t go. Over the years, we’ve discovered a few
ways of keeping your campaign going in the direction that you want.
Allowing for free will
One of the problems with keeping the party on track is that those pesky play-
ers demand to have free will, or at least the illusion that they have free will,
and that they get to determine the course of their characters’ actions. This is
an important illusion to maintain; as soon as your players start to feel like
their characters are nothing but your puppets, they’ll begin to lose interest in
the campaign.
This means that they have to be given choices throughout the campaign.
They have to be able to make a choice of whether or not to assault a particu-
lar enemy, and choices about whether or not to take a specific approach to
attack an enemy’s lair, and choices about how they take on that enemy, and
choices about what to do after they vanquish their enemy. This can mean a
302
Part V: Building Your Own World 

lot of work on your part if you want to fully develop your campaign to be
ready for any choice they make. We don’t know about you, but we don’t have
that much time in our lives for creating our campaigns.
Just because the players believe they have choices doesn’t mean that you
really have to give them choices. For example, say you present them with the
choice of assaulting one of three different dungeons. Unless you want them to
go on a wild goose chase, you don’t have to create three different dungeons —
just create one, and regardless which of the three the party chooses, they
wind up in the same dungeon. Trust us, if you handle this well, neither the
players — nor their characters — will know the difference.
You can (and should — at least part of the time) give players the option of
going off on wild goose chases, especially if you have given them all sorts 
of clues and they still are not paying attention to the information you’ve
given them. In this case, we suggest that you let them undergo a difficult and
dangerous adventure — one that does absolutely nothing to further their
objectives — as an object lesson to pay closer attention to clues.
However, if they have really tried and still made the wrong decision, and you
do not want to let them go on an adventure that runs after the feral wild fowl,
you can be nice and allow them to gain something of benefit from the mission.
Perhaps the hidden laboratory that they attacked wasn’t where the secret
experiments on space aliens are taking place, but it does have information
that the party can find that will more firmly give them the coordinates of
where they can find Area 51.
This can also play out if the party misinterprets a series of your clues and
has gone off in a direction that you realize makes sense (yes, this sometimes
happens, when players see more potential ramifications of a clue than the
GM who actually created the world). You can always either make some modi-
fications to your scenarios so that their course of action leads them back to
your established plotline, or you can “throw them a bone” by giving them
something of benefit by going in what was essentially the “wrong” direction.
Why would you want to do this? You want to encourage your players to think
creatively, to look for alternative solutions, and to take the chance to figure
out your puzzles even at the risk of being wrong.
This illustrates another problem with keeping parties on track; all the infor-
mation that they get has to be in the context of the game world and has to be
in the form of clues or (at the very best) incomplete information. You can’t
just tell the party “Go to ‘X’ dungeon, kill the Evil Overlord and all his minions
using the tritium-powered ray guns that you found in your last adventure,
and, by the way, don’t pick up the cursed crystals you’ll find in the overlord’s
desk drawer.” Such a campaign wouldn’t be able to sustain the interest of
many players (unless such information came from an NPC, and it turned out
that the Evil Overlord was immune to tritium-powered ray guns, and the crys-
tals weren’t cursed, or maybe the overlord wasn’t immune, but the crystals
weren’t cursed either).
303
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

The whole purpose of forcing the party to gather and figure out the clues that
you provide is to force them to think and solve puzzles; unfortunately, that
means that sometimes they will either miss one or more clues or misinter-
pret the clues and not get the message you’re trying to convey. This can be
extremely frustrating for a GM. The section, “Dropping, sprinkling, and hitting
your players over the head with clues,” later in this chapter, may be able to
help with this problem.
A GM who compels the party to a particular course of action is not a good
GM, but a GM who manipulates the party into choosing the desired course of
action is an excellent one.
Exploiting disadvantages
Although players can always misinterpret your clues and riddles, you do
have a tool that can encourage your players to make the necessary choices
that will further the plotline: the characters’ disadvantages. Exploiting disad-
vantages sometimes takes some creativity, but the more you can hook the
players through the disadvantages that they chose for their characters and
manipulate them into following your plotline in order to stay true to their
characters’ personalities, the easier your job will be.
The easiest and most obvious disadvantages you can use are Dependents and
Enemies. For example, in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign, he manipulated the
party’s course of action for years through one Dependent NPC, the eight-
year-old son of one of the party members who was also in the line of royal
succession for one of the Avonlea domains. The boy fell under a curse and was
in danger of turning into a soulless monster unless the party found a way to
lift the curse (which turned out to require the blood of the wizard who laid the
curse). Until they were finally able to track the wizard down and trap him long
enough to bleed him, every member of the party essentially had a ring through
his nose — all Bjoern had to do was suggest that there was a clue to lifting the
boy’s curse and they went haring off in whichever direction he pointed.
Of course, other disadvantages are at your disposal as well. The so-called
“positive” disadvantages (Vows, Codes of Honor, Honesty, Sense of Duty, and
so on) can be extremely useful in this regard. A character with a Vow to serve
a particular deity, for example, is pretty much obligated to take actions that
would further or protect the service of that deity.
A creative GM can even use the negative mental disadvantages. For example,
say that a party member has (and is known to have) Bloodlust. If a local bigwig
is butchered by a mysterious assailant with a vague resemblance to that party
member, suspicion will naturally fall in that character’s direction. If handled
correctly, the party would then need to take action to prove their comrade’s
innocence, which may include finding and apprehending the real perpetrator. And
if, in the course of the investigation, they uncover information that acts as a
more serious hook for the party, that disadvantage has more than done its job.
304
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Manipulating emotions
From some of the other things we’ve said in this chapter, you may have been
able to figure out another strategy you can take — with or without the exploita-
tion of disadvantages — and that is getting the party (both players and charac-
ters) emotionally invested in the game world. We won’t lie to you: This isn’t
easy, and it takes more work on your part, but we think it’s worth it. When your
party is emotionally attached to one or more parts of your game world, all you
have to do is threaten that attachment and they will line up for their marching
orders. We’ve found this is especially true if we allow the party to have a home,
stronghold, or base of operations that they can call their own. After they’ve
joined the ranks of the landed class, all you have to do is menace their home
with any kind of threat (anything from invasion to infection), and most parties
will do anything in their power to protect their land.
In the final analysis, the key to keeping your party on track is to figure out what
interests them — both players and characters — and then to show no mercy in
manipulating those interests to get the results you desire. Yes, the PCs can
always choose to ignore your manipulations, but chances are they won’t.
Dropping, sprinkling, and hitting your
players over the head with clues
Sometimes the greatest fun in a campaign comes from tracking down, collect-
ing, and then figuring out the clues the GM provides to figure out what’s
going on, what the party is supposed to do next, and what great calamity the
party is barely able to forestall by their actions. You can, of course, simply
have the party’s Patron hand them a mission brief detailing the location of
the target, the objectives, and the consequences of failing at the mission,
complete with a dossier containing floor plans, security codes, and fake iden-
tity cards. There is nothing wrong with setting up an adventure this way, and
we recommend that you occasionally start an adventure like this to keep vari-
ety in your GMing style. But if this is the only way you get your party moving,
your players may start feeling like they’re your puppets and start plotting a
coup against you.
Say your plotline calls for the party to infiltrate, rob, or assault a facility
that is controlled by your Mastermind, a secret laboratory conducting 
mutagenic experiments during local PTA meetings that is located in the 
basement of the local offices of the Department of the Treasury. How do
you convey that information to the party? How do you get them to want to go
on this suicidal mission? How do you let them know what they’re supposed
to do when they get into the place? All of these are difficult questions for any
good GM.
305
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

The steps below show you how to answer these questions. As you look over
the list, keep in mind that you probably don’t want to force your party to
gather clues to get all the information they need for every detail of the cam-
paign. If you try it, you’ll probably find (as we did) that it results in an incredi-
ble amount of blithering, floundering, and unproductive dithering. Do both
your party and yourself a favor and allow them to uncover or receive some of
the information they need at the very start of the adventure.
Follow these steps to figure out how to dole out information about your plot-
line to the party:
1. Decide what information the party must have.
Typically the information that your party needs falls into one of eight
categories:
• The past activities of the Mastermind that have direct bearing
upon the adventure.
• The identity of the primary opponent for this adventure.
• The location of the next dungeon.
• The Mastermind’s objectives.
• The Mastermind’s next course of action.
• The consequences of the Mastermind achieving his/her/its 
objectives.
• The actions the party needs to take to foil the Mastermind.
• The actions the party needs to take to further their personal objec-
tives in this particular adventure.
2. Determine what information you will give to the party.
You have many ways of giving information to the party; any time any of
the party members encounters an NPC, the GM has an opportunity to
parse out information. This includes pretty much any information that
the party members receive from any source. For example, this could be
a briefing from a patron, ally, or another kind of employer. There are lots
of other mechanisms you could use as well.
3. Decide what clues you’re going to give the party (which you have
because you have already fully developed your climax and
Mastermind like we told you to, right?).
The information you decided not to give the party in Step 2 will have to
be divined by the characters in the party, and they can do this only if
you leave a trail of breadcrumbs for them to follow.
If a clue is especially important, you might want to come up with a back-
up plan for how you’ll get it to the party if they consistently miss finding
it the way you initially conceived.

4. Make up a few red herrings (false clues).
Keep in mind that no investigator can realistically expect all clues to be
relevant and accurate, which is why we include this step here. Perhaps
the majority of clues should be so, but not necessarily. Some sources of
information are simply misinformed, others may deliberately attempt to
mislead the party, and many clues may be subject to different interpreta-
tions. When assembling the clues, make sure that the right path is the
one that has the most clues that make sense and that your red herrings
can be proven to be incorrect or irrelevant — if your party is willing to
go through the steps of verifying their legitimacy.
5. Decide the source for each clue.
Here’s a short list of some of some of our favorites:
• Informants. NPCs who the party knows because of an advantage
like Patron, Ally, Ally Group, or Contacts are usually the most reli-
able sources of information — and provide more complete access
than other sources.
• Research. In modern campaigns, this can be as simple as the party
geek turning on his laptop and Googling; in low-tech campaigns,
you can create mini-adventures by making the PCs trek to libraries
housed in remote monasteries. You can even make them go through
a quest to find out where they can get the information to go on their
real quest. Be sure to have whatever ancient tomes of obscure knowl-
edge they find be appropriately decrepit, smudged, and worm-eaten.
• Supernatural advice. This may come from the mad prophet who is
chained to a stake in the village square and spends all day scream-
ing out the visions that plague him. Or it could be a summoned
spirit or demon. If you use this route, make sure that the clues are
couched in vague, convoluted, or metaphorical language, use bad
poetry (rhyming couplets are usually both pretty easy to throw
together and pretty dreadful), and can be easily misinterpreted.
• Treasure maps. This can be any sort of data source that somehow
falls into the party’s possession (it could be a map, a diary, a video
recording, and so on) that has the information they need in some
kind of encrypted format. With this as a source of knowledge, a sub-
stantial chunk of the adventure ought to be figuring out how to
decipher the clues and avoid the traps that the person who pro-
duced the data source set up to keep people like the PCs from sur-
viving their investigation.
• Witnesses. These are NPCs who have observed — or been affected
by — the situation the party is investigating. These are just ordi-
nary people who got pulled into the matter unknowingly and
unwillingly. Typically, they may not know that they have informa-
tion that would be of value and need to be gently interrogated
before they can divulge their clues.
307
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

• Enemies. Perhaps this is one of the Mastermind’s own minions that
the party has been able to capture for interrogation (be careful
about what you allow the PCs to get away with in terms of torture).
Regardless of the exact scenario, these sources of information are
hostile to the party and will attempt to slip in at least some harm-
fully incorrect information.
• Espionage. Consider this a catchall phrase for active steps the
party has to take to collect clues without getting caught at it. They
may have to tap someone’s phone line, break into some company’s
confidential records, or tail a courier. In all events, the party has a
vested interest in keeping the person they’re spying on from find-
ing out what they’re doing.
6. Set up your clues in a series of “layers.”
How you structure your clues depends on how much effort you want
your players to have to put into their investigations. If you want them to
expend significant effort to unravel the mystery — and spend a substan-
tial amount of campaign time investigating — then you don’t want them
to suddenly get the key piece of information on their first night out.
All players seem to have a mystic gift for screwing up campaigns, so if
you don’t make allowances for this in advance, we can almost guarantee
that you’ll be scrambling to recover as your party winds up blitzkrieging
your Mastermind a long time before you’re ready for them to do so. So
you want to have some control over how and when the party gets its
information. What we like to do is allow them to get the information in a
steadily increasing stream; their initial informants, witnesses, or torture
victims won’t necessarily know much — just enough to keep the party
moving. Each encounter typically offers more and better information
than the prior attempts (although we try to vary this somewhat so that
the pattern isn’t easily recognizable to the players).
At some point — and you’ll probably have no idea when this happens —
the information the party has gained will achieve a critical mass, and
they’ll suddenly know what they need to do. Most parties then go charging
off to do it, swollen with pride that they have solved your mystery. This is
great, but they may be acting prematurely, especially if they haven’t gained
all the information that they need to successfully complete the campaign
and survive. You would be well advised to develop a strategy for how
you will handle this situation without appearing to be heavy-handed. 
• You can find some way of letting them know that they don’t have
everything they need.
• You can find some way of dropping the critical information in 
their laps.
308
Part V: Building Your Own World 

• You can remove some element of the next phase of the adventure
so they don’t need the missing information
• You can let them go ahead with their plans without changing 
anything.
If you decide on the latter (and we’re not saying you should), remember
to be polite and smile sweetly when you hand them back their heads —
and use the good silver platters to return their cranial appendages,
rather than just the everyday dishes.
Puzzling Your Parties
In Chapter 17, we talk about some of the different types of campaigns that
you can create, including the “puzzling campaigns.” Keep in mind that even if
you’re not running this type of campaign, you can still use puzzles in nearly
any type of campaign; if nothing else, a puzzle can change the pace from the
same old, same old of slaughtering hundreds of orcs every week. But you
need to keep some things in mind when you set up puzzles for your parties,
and we’re here to give you some pointers. We’re not going to tell you how to
create a puzzle for your campaign, though. (Do you really want to give any of
your players who happen to read this chapter that kind of an advantage?)
When you’re creating a puzzle for your campaign, you always need to keep in
mind who is playing in your campaign, not just who the PCs are. Regardless
of anything else, the players must be able to solve the puzzle, regardless of
what abilities or knowledge their characters possess. It doesn’t matter whether
you have somehow allowed a character to have a skill level of 25 in a skill that
essentially translates into “Knows Absolutely Everything About the Campaign,”
you shouldn’t allow any of your puzzles to be solved by a roll of the dice. At the
very most, all that a skill or knowledge roll should be able to give a party is
some kind of hint — and then only if the character has a skill that is relevant to
the puzzle — but definitely not the solution to the puzzle.
You have to be aware of who your players are so that you can develop a
puzzle that you know they have the ability to solve. For example, if you have
a graduate degree in physics and everyone else in your gaming group is a 
liberal arts major, it is neither fair nor appropriate to create a puzzle that
requires someone to have training in quantum mechanics in order to solve it.
Nor is it fair to create puzzles that only one or two players in the group have
the knowledge, training, or ability to solve. We recommend that you try to
develop puzzles that everyone has the ability to solve. This essentially means
that you shouldn’t use intensely specialized or restricted knowledge at all
unless everyone in your gaming group has equivalent education in basically
the same field.
309
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

We do feel that it is fair to draw upon modern popular culture for your puz-
zles, even if your game world has nothing to do with 21st-century Earth.
(However, if that’s the case, we think you ought to find some appropriate jus-
tification for why an anachronistic puzzle shows up in your world at all.) It is
also fair to create puzzles based on being able to think rationally and logi-
cally and make associations without needing specific knowledge, like the kind
of questions that are asked on standardized IQ and proficiency tests.
If you need inspiration for puzzle ideas for your campaign, we recommend
that you hunt around for an SAT study guide. Several different varieties are
available, and you may be able to find them in a used bookstore for cheap.
These books are chock-full of sample questions for high school students
studying for their SATs, which is about the highest level of difficulty we rec-
ommend for a puzzle, and they are usually based upon problem-solving skills
more than on a specific knowledge base. Check them out.
Keep in mind that not every puzzle must somehow be involved in furthering
the plot; sometimes they can just be there to create distractions or to tor-
ment the players. Here are two examples for you about hugely successful
puzzles that didn’t further the adventure one whit, both of them from
Bjoern’s Space Mages campaign:
 Sir Strongarm. In the first example, the party literally spent months ago-
nizing over the identity of the mysterious alien known as “Sir Strongarm,”
who, in the legendary past, had assisted the mages of that world with
developing magical space flight — a technology that was then lost and
forgotten for centuries. The fact that Neil Armstrong had been magically
summoned to that world to assist the project had absolutely no rele-
vance to the completion of the party’s mission or the fulfillment of the
plot, but when they finally solved the puzzle, the maniacally giggling GM
was chased out of the room by the enraged players hurling handfuls of
popcorn and potato chips at him.
 Amphibious assault tank. At another point in that same campaign, the
party ran across an artifact that was described as a very large metal
barrel lying on its side. Inside the barrel they found two chairs bolted to
the sides in front of a panel with a total of 149 knobs, switches, and
levers; all of them with labels written in an unknown language (the GM
provided the players with a lovely diagram with each feature carefully
numbered to represent the undecipherable labels). Because the party
had not one, but three characters with the Curiosity disadvantage, we
spent a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting evening while the party fig-
ured out how to make the magically powered amphibious assault tank
operate. But alas! The artifact had only enough (irreplaceable) fuel left
for the party to figure out how to use the thing, and then it sputtered to
a stop, becoming a huge rusting and unusable hulk.

Part V: Building Your Own World 

The Ins and Outs of Architecture
It is possible to have a campaign in which nearly all the action, encounters,
and adventures occur outside in an interesting wilderness flavor, but even-
tually you’ll need to start creating floor plans for buildings where some of 
the action takes place. This can be anything from the abandoned farmhouse
where your party takes refuge to the L5 orbiting space station that they need
to wrest from the Evil Overlord before he uses it to rain devastation upon all
living things on Earth.
Creating structures isn’t as simple as creating geographical maps. You need
to take many different features (the different kinds of rooms, the furniture
and decorations in those rooms, and so on) into consideration when creating
the structures where your party will engage in life-or-death confrontations
(which can be an apartment building, a barn, a castle, or a space station, but
which, for convenience sake, we simply call “the dungeon” from here on).
Although you can simply randomly draw in rooms, it won’t make much sense,
and it will eventually tell your players that you didn’t care enough to create a
dungeon that had a feeling of intelligent design behind it. If you pay attention
to the following list, you’ll create dungeons that keep a party’s interest.
In preparation, you might want to check out some floor plans of real build-
ings; your local library is full of architectural books that can provide a wealth
of information. Even many gaming stores have books on castles, fortresses,
and other historical structures that you can draw from. We urge you to see
how builders from different cultures and different time periods organized
their structures. You don’t have to imitate anything that you run across
(unless you want to), but doing a little bit of research and thinking about how
buildings need to fit together will add that feeling of reality to your dungeons
that is readily apparent; players who like to think before they start killing
everything that moves will be very appreciative.
It’s time for Dungeon Building 101. The following steps show you how to
create the architecture of a functional dungeon:
1. Consider the personality and purpose of the designer and builder of
the dungeon.
You could conceivably have an NPC in the dim history of your game
world suddenly exclaim, “I’m feeling grouchy today, I think I’ll blow all
my fortune and squander the lives of a few thousand slaves to erect a
building that serves no purpose other than to be a death trap for parties
of adventurers long after I’m dead.” That might be what the dungeon is
now (and that might even be in keeping with the builder’s wishes), but
that is not what motivated him/her/it to go through all the hassles of 
311
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

getting the dungeon built in the first place. That motivation is going to
determine much about the design of the place.
2. Consider what else is in the immediate vicinity of the dungeon.
Unless the dungeon really is an L5 space station, your party is going to
want to know what is around it (and even if it is an L5, they’ll probably
want to know what the next-closest stations, ships, or satellites to it
are). Is it in the middle of a thriving city? In the ruins of a ghost metropo-
lis? On a mountain peak? Deep in a swamp or under the sea? Each of
these is a valid choice, and each has its own demands on how you pre-
pare the dungeon. A good party is probably going to want to know the
answers to some of the following questions:
• How close can they get to the dungeon unobserved?
• What structures around the dungeon could house enemy forces
that they have to deal with?
• What structures can they use around the dungeon for a base of
operations?
• What structures around the dungeon can they use as an observa-
tion post?
• What structures around the dungeon could hold secret entrances
or exits into or out of the dungeon?
3. Consider all the ways — both overt and covert — into and out of the
dungeon.
Of course there’s a “front door,” and there’s probably also a “back door,”
but is there a secret “rabbit’s hole”? What about sewer tunnels? Or sally
ports? Or kitchen doors? Or roof access? Trust us on this: The one route
you forget to consider is going to be the way the party wants to get into
the dungeon.
4. Determine what types of rooms are going to be in your dungeon.
If the dungeon was built to be a military stronghold, it will have barracks,
dining halls, kitchens, armories, meeting rooms, and so on. If it was built
as the tomb of the Evil Wizard, then it probably won’t have any of those,
but it may have ritual rooms, treasure rooms, a crypt, and a whole lot of
traps. We recommend that you make a list of all the different types of
rooms that you would expect to find in the type of structure that the dun-
geon was intended to be.
5. Consider how air, water, and heat will move through your dungeon,
and how waste will get out.
If the dungeon is any bigger than a single-family residence, it needs to
have space devoted to water pipes, air conduits, and sewage pipes, and
you need to determine how rooms are heated. Even in a low-tech cam-
paign in which all heating is done by burning wood or coal, you can’t
just stick a fireplace in every room — you would need to make
allowances for all those chimneys, if nothing else. 
312
Part V: Building Your Own World 

You don’t need to come up with a separate floor plan showing all of the
ductwork, but you need to make allowances for it in the thickness of 
the walls and ceilings, and maybe even allow for the lighter and more
nimble members of the party to move from room to room through these
outlets — unless they’re booby-trapped, of course.
6. Consider how traffic flow will be affected by corridor width.
Standard GURPS rules say that a character needs at least a one-hex wide
area to move and fight unimpeded. That means that, in a dungeon, a
one-hex-wide corridor typically allows for single-file movement, a two-
hex-wide corridor is needed for either two people to walk abreast or
single-file movement in both directions. The wider the corridor, the
more options for movement. 
For logistical reasons, we consider a typical city sidewalk to be at least
two yards (two hexes) wide in most urban areas, and may be as narrow
as a single hex (one yard) in older or poorer neighborhoods, and as much
as four to six hexes in locations that are more amenable to pedestrian
traffic. As in the case of our sidewalks, your architecture needs to repre-
sent a reasonable place to campaign more than it needs to reflect reality. 
Allowing for character movement really chews into your available space,
but it can’t be helped. The broader the corridor, the more likely it is to
move large numbers of people quickly; however, the narrower the corridor,
the more defensible it is by small numbers. This is how you can have char-
acters heroically defending a castle single-handedly against an army; if a
critical point of access is made into a one-hex-wide choke point, a single
determined defender can single-handedly stop hundreds of invaders.
7. Consider how rooms are arranged to maximize the utility of each space.
For example: Unless other factors (such as technology, aesthetics, or
social position) take precedence, food storage facilities are located close
to major access points; kitchens are near food storage facilities and with
clean water in close proximity; dining rooms are located close to the
kitchens; and so on.
8. Consider the hows and the whys of the current occupants.
If the dungeon’s creator is still using it, this isn’t an issue. But if your
dungeon is a ruins, has passed out of the original builders’ hands and
into someone else’s control, or is merely the current manifestation of
Mad Morkol’s Home for Wandering Monsters, you ought to put some
thought into how the current occupants came to possess the dungeon,
why they decided to take possession, and how they support themselves
in the dungeon.
Stuart developed an ingenious way of using Microsoft Excel (you could likely
use any old spreadsheet program) to create dungeon floor plans. To get started,
select all the cells in the worksheet and format your cell height to 18 and the
width to 3. This gives you approximately 1⁄4-inch square cells. You can then
draw walls by using the Borders tab in the Format➪Cells dialog box. You can
313
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

use different colors or types of lines to indicate different features. You can fill
cells with different colors inside the borders to color-code your rooms. You
can even draw diagonal lines to get 45-degree angles. 
If you are concerned about fitting this onto a hex grid, simply make sure that
the size of the squares in your spreadsheet is the same as the hex paper you
use, and use the hex paper when you print your maps onto hard copy. 
Figure 19-1 shows you a partial floor plan using this technique. The figure
depicts a floor plan of the ground floor of an art gallery/studio/secret lab-
oratory that a party might have to infiltrate. Notice the tabs at the bottom
of the figure: Each worksheet can be a different floor in your dungeon.
You can also create forgeries on a separate worksheet for the party to see
(check out the sidebar, “Foisting forgeries on the party,” later in this chapter,
for more about this).

Traps, tricks, and dead ends
GMs have been putting traps in their dungeons
since the earliest days of role playing games.
You have probably already encountered (or
used yourself) the “poisoned needle in the key-
hole” trap to guard against incautious thieves,
or the “pressure switch under the floorboard”
trap that can send javelins, lightning bolts, or
machine gun fire into the unwary party. If you
haven’t, you’ve missed out on some of the great
fun of gaming — the feeling of dread and terror
at every locked door and the sense of relief and
accomplishment with every defused land mine.
We heartily recommend that you sprinkle a few
traps into your dungeons to keep your party on
their toes. But don’t overdo it. We had a GM
who put so many traps in his dungeons that our
party put a mannequin on wheels at the end of
a 10-foot pole to trigger any traps first — and
we were still creating new characters on a reg-
ular basis. We suggest that you find an appro-
priate middle ground, one that will keep your
players alert and attentive to business but not
to the point at which the terror of the trap is
dulled from overuse.
Here’s one little tactic that we have used to
good effect: Set up the initial trap the party will
encounter as an overwhelming death trap, one
that not only would be impossible to survive but
has a spectacular effect as well (a massive
explosion, for example). Then put some other
traps — ones that are more reasonable, and
may even be survivable for anyone caught in
them — in a few strategic locations throughout
your dungeon. Then, when your party is going
through this dungeon, you deliberately cause
that first death trap to misfire before the party
has a chance of triggering it. (Be sure to swear
and cuss appropriately so that they don’t real-
ize that you had no intention of ever inflicting
that trap on them.) Make sure the entire party
sees this trap go off, and make sure that they
can see what the consequences could have
been if they’d been caught in it. If you do this
right, you will inspire dread, terror, and caution
in the hearts of your players (the three favorite
emotions of all GMs) without causing the cam-
paign to stall because they have to stop every
five minutes to disarm yet another trap.
Be sure to put some tricks in your dungeon as
well: rotating walls, shifting floors, trans-dimen-
sional portals — whatever is appropriate for
your milieu. We once had a campaign in which
the party had to assault a wizard’s tower. It
turned out that it was not one tower, but three,
with each tower in a different dimension. The
three towers interpenetrated each other (like
the circles in a Venn diagram), and where the
three towers joined lay a fourth tower that was
a prison for anyone who didn’t know the secret
of the towers and could only be escaped by
learning how to operate the magical portals that
connected all the towers.
And don’t forget the dead ends — anything that
can attract (or distract) the party’s attention but
that has absolutely nothing of relevance or
value for the adventure. One GM included in his
campaign a way to use magic to create ball
bearings and had his Evil Wizard build a ball-
bearing factory in the middle of his fortress. It
was a hugely interesting place, with not a trap in
evidence, and we had to explore it from top to
bottom to make sure that it wasn’t relevant to
our quest. This resulted in several highly enter-
taining theoretical discussions about the appro-
priate application of magic in that game world,
and it also allowed the evil mage a chance to
make a leisurely escape before we could finish
our explorations.

Basic Cartography
For campaigns that involve any travel or outdoor action, both you and your
players will have an easier time conceiving of the game world if you produce
one or more maps of where the campaign will take place.
We recommend that you produce a general map of the entire geographic area
that the average character in your campaign is likely to know. How much area
these maps cover is up to you and is dependent upon the campaign milieu.
For a space campaign, you need to have star charts of the areas the party is
likely to be traveling through. In Hellenistic Egypt, you shouldn’t have to
worry about anything outside of the Mediterranean Sea and its adjacent
lands. If you’re running a “modern” campaign, you need at least a map of, say,
the United States — or its analog in your game world. In general, because
travel is more limited, lower tech levels need smaller areas mapped.
You should also have a detailed map of the immediate vicinity where the cam-
paign will take place. This could be the city, town, village, and surrounding
countryside where the campaign will start out — along with any other areas
that the party is likely to travel to in the immediate future.
If you’re going to be running your campaign on Earth, or a near analog of
Earth, the simplest thing to do is to get a real-life map of the area where the
campaign will be run. You can even find historical maps for pretty near any
epoch in the historical period for an area. The closer your game world
matches the real world, the more you’ll be able to leverage existing maps
rather than having to create your own.
If your game world is entirely of your own imagining, then you need to do a little
more work. But keep in mind that, because the world is entirely of your imagin-
ing, there is no such thing as accuracy. The world is exactly as you map it, but
check out the sidebar, “Foisting forgeries on the party,” in regard to this.
When mapping, we find that using graph or hex paper is extremely helpful. It
automatically provides a scale to the map and allows you to focus on specific
grids if you need specific locality maps later on. You’ll probably need lots of
sheets of paper as you work through the process, so we recommend that you
pick up a pack — you should be able to pick one up at your local gaming store.
The following steps walk you through mapping an area in a new game world.
Following these steps will make things more quickly and easily for you in the
long run.
1. Figure out which direction is going to be North.
316
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Please note that this doesn’t have to be “north” in the traditional sense
of the word (the top of the world). All the compasses in your world
might point toward the mountain where the Gods live or where the sun
sets. It’s up to you; just put this at the “top” of your map.
2. Determine the scale for this map.
For low-tech campaigns, we like to set the scale so that the distance a
character can travel in a day using the typical method of transportation
can be counted out easily by the number of grids. For a high-tech cam-
paign, you might think about creating your scale so that the typical dis-
tance that people travel between actions can be determined by simply
counting the grids (for example, giving the grids a scale that is divisible
by the average speed of travel).
3. Determine and draw in the geographical “boundaries” for this map.
The charted area within every map typically ends with some boundary,
barrier, or landmark in each direction — even if the physical map contin-
ues on past that boundary, the presumption is that another map exists
to detail the area on the far side of that boundary. Typical boundaries
are coastlines (lakes or oceans), mountain ranges, rivers, political bor-
ders, the extent of the explored territories, or even of the known world —
beyond which “Here Be Dragons” is an appropriate label.
4. Determine what geographical barriers are inside the map area and
draw them in.
Geographical barriers are anything that blocks, restricts, inhibits, chan-
nels, or impedes transportation. Typically, the location of mountain
ranges determines the location of foothills, and together they determine
the course of rivers, which affects the placement of lakes and swamps,
so these boundaries are added in that order. Figure 19-2 shows our sug-
gestion for how you can draw in these different features in a way that
you can easily identify the different areas on sight. The figure shows
seven different symbols you can use on your map to indicate different
types of terrain. Adding these features in color makes them even more
clearly distinguishable.

Desert
Foothills
Swamps
Plains / Grasslands

317
Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting

5. Fill in the “wilderness” areas on your map.
The wilderness areas are forest/jungle, plains/grasslands, and desert.
You want to make good use of color on your map to distinguish between
the different wilderness areas (a light green for forest, a dark green for
jungle, a yellowish-green for plains and grasslands, a blue-green for
swamp, a yellow for desert, and so on). Figure 19-3 shows a black-and-
white version of what your map might look like at this point. We wish
you could see this map in color; it’s really pretty.
6. Put in your major population centers, both active and deserted.
Unless your game world is built upon different cultural imperatives than
Earth’s, cities are usually built along or next to major waterways and at
the junctions of natural routes of travel. If your campaign calls for ancient
ruined cities from lost civilizations, they will probably occur in the same
sorts of areas, although the course of a river may have changed or a rich
Figure 19-3:

just started

318
Part V: Building Your Own World 

mineral deposit played out to make the ancient site no longer attractive —
or it could be the hordes of restless dead who haunt the streets and alleys
on moonless nights that have kept people away!
7. Extend roadways between the populated areas.
8. Identify rural areas, fortresses, farmlands, and outlying settlements.
Typically, these grow up in concentric circles around the cities and then
flow down corridors between cities that are formed near roads and
rivers and will cut into any intervening forests, jungles, and grasslands.
9. Determine political boundaries, if any, within your mapped area.
Political boundaries generally follow some easily identifiable line that
represents something that is both easily described in treaty negotiations
and easily fortified if the treaties are broken.

We doubt that anyone could get all this right in a single pass of the previ-
ous nine steps. What is more likely is that as you go through this process,
you’ll think of things that you want to add to your game world. You might
have an epiphany of a brilliant plot device that requires that one particu-
lar area be just so, or you’ll want to have a place where the halflings can
live in peace, or some such. The point is, don’t let yourself get locked in
at this stage. Be willing to redo some or all of the map enough times that
you have your game world work out exactly the way you want.

Chapter 19: Mapping, Planning, and Plotting
Foisting forgeries on the party
Unless your campaign is set in a world that has
satellite mapping, it’s highly improbable that
your players would be able to have a map of the
game world that is as comprehensive or as
accurate as the map you’re working from as the
GM. (Even if there is satellite imaging, who’s to
say that the government hasn’t left out certain
features that it doesn’t want the public to know
about?) This applies to territorial maps, illicitly
gained floor plans, treasure maps, and any
other type of map that the player characters
may have acquired. We recommend that you
make a separate map that is based on, but
subtly different from, the map that you use for
GMing. You can change the scale, alter the ter-
rain, and add or remove map elements, espe-
cially removing the potential objects of quests.
If you intend on sending the party on a quest to
find the Lost City of the Necromantic Halflings,
you certainly don’t want it to show up on any of
the maps they are likely to get their hands on.
This is where doing your maps on the computer
can be a big help; you don’t have to start from
scratch, and making little modifications can be
done relatively easily.

What a wonder the computer can be for the modern GM! Regardless of where
your campaign takes place, you can use your computer and scanner to make
mapping a snap! All you need to do is find a map of an area that resembles
how you want your area to look and scan it into your computer. Save it as a
graphic file that can be manipulated with a low-end graphics application (if
you’re running Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Paint is more than adequate for
your needs). You can then erase any areas that don’t fit your conception and
redraw the world to fit your needs. You can then even scan in a sheet of hex
paper or graph paper and paste your map onto it as a transparent overlay so
that scale is readily apparent.
If you think you’ll want or need to create some new feature in the middle of a
campaign, you may want to leave some undefined area on your map that you
can fill in after you have a new, brilliant idea. The safest thing is to reserve
this area on one edge of the map — it’s less likely to be noticed by snoopy
players if it’s not taking up space in the middle of the map.

 Producing the Patrons, Allies, and Contacts for the party
 Generating Dependents who are dependable troublemakers
 Making the neutral NPCs interesting
 Building up the background characters
A
s the GM, you are responsible for creating and controlling every non-PC
character that populates your game world. You are not only every
single minion of the Evil Overlord, you are also every non-evil person or
entity. You play every enemy, every Ally, every Dependent, every Patron, and
even the innocent bystanders on the street. To a great extent, the interaction
between the party and your NPCs determines how your players experience
your campaign. You want the characters who are important to the adventure
to be more than two-dimensional cookie cutouts; you want them to seem real
and to be memorable.
This chapter helps you create all of these characters and shows you how to
make them interesting by involving aspects of your game universe.
Getting Good Mileage out of Your 
Bad Guys — Adversaries
GMs spend most of their time and energy creating challenging adversaries —
those characters who are hostile to the party and must be overcome in order
to successfully complete the mission. We categorize adversaries into three
distinct groups:
 Masterminds
 Mini-minds
 Minions

We talk about each of these groups individually in the next few sections.
The Mastermind
We first encountered the concept of the Mastermind in the Harkwood campaign
module that was one of the earliest products by Steve Jackson Games, and it
made so much sense to us that, with some modifications, we’ve continued
to use it to the present day. In terms of the plotline for your campaign, the
Mastermind is the NPC who is ultimately behind the problems the party faces,
even if he/she/it doesn’t even know the party exists. The Mastermind may be
the Dark Lord determined to achieve dominion over your world, the “hive
mind” of a sentient virus that seeks to infect and colonize your game world,
or the nine-year-old daughter of a character’s neighbor who unintentionally
sets a series of events in motion that the party is called upon to address.
Typically, the party’s actions have a profound effect upon the Mastermind’s
fortunes, so it is a good idea to create the Mastermind as a very detailed NPC,
even if you have no intention of the party ever coming face-to-face with
him/her/it. Creating such an NPC involves more than just writing down a
322
Part V: Building Your Own World 
Not all NPCs are created equal
You would be quickly overwhelmed if you tried
to create all of your NPCs with a level of depth
and sophistication to make each one unique;
that would be a huge task that could consume
all of your available time, and we don’t recom-
mend it. Instead, you need to determine which
characters are unique and memorable additions
to your campaign, and which ones are merely
templates that you use as “spear-carriers” in
combat scenarios or for background color.
By sheer numbers, most of your NPCs can
simply be templates that you can draw upon
when you need them; you can personalize them
as needed by giving them a specific advantage,
disadvantage, or quirk or by changing what
weapons they carry or armor they wear. In many
cases, you can simply ad-lib, and for the most
part, your players won’t know the difference
between these characters and the ones that you
have spent hours laboring over to make unique.
One thing that we strongly advise you to let go
of right now is any urge to calculate the point
values of your NPCs or to try to balance the NPC
characters by using the same point limitations
that you set for your PCs. If you do this, you’re
just setting yourself up for lots of extra work that
doesn’t really get you anything. Instead, we rec-
ommend that you create adversaries for the
party with abilities that make them credible —
but not overpowering — threats and give them
however many (or few) disadvantages that you
need to create the psychology that you want for
the character. This does not apply to what we’re
calling Companion NPCs (described later in this
chapter).

list of attributes, advantages, disadvantages, and skills; it involves develop-
ing the character’s psychology, the potential reactions he/she/it might have
to the party’s efforts (especially as they come closer to the goal), and how
the Mastermind may try to stop — or help — the party in achieving its 
objective.
One of the Masterminds that the party has dealt with in Bjoern’s Avonlea
campaign was a millenia-old sorcerer from the Bale race (GURPS Fantasy Folk,
Second Edition, pages 32–35) named Sariel, the Lord of the Keep of Wasted
Flesh. Figure 20-1 shows Sariel’s character sheet. Notice that along the right
edge, Bjoern created a short biography of the character to get a handle on
his psychology.
We think that GMs need to develop, to the best of their ability, the back-
ground and character psychology of the Mastermind, even if they never plan
on having the characters in the party directly confront this NPC. This allows
you to get a better understanding of the Mastermind character and to better
be able to determine how the Mastermind will respond to the characters’
actions — especially when you have to make spur-of-the-moment decisions in
response to party actions.

Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

In some campaigns, it might be sufficient to have the Mastermind repeatedly
send out hordes of underlings to rampage through your game world with no
strategy other than to engage the party in combat. But if your party is com-
posed of sophisticated players, you will need to develop a plan of action for
your Mastermind to follow, especially if your Mastermind character is delib-
erately creating the situation that the party is forced to confront. It’s rarely
enough to say that the Mastermind’s goal is to “find X artifact and use it to
dominate the world”; you need to develop a strategy for the Mastermind to
achieve his objectives that is both credible and sustainable.
In the case of Sariel, he had several objectives that he needed to achieve to
meet this demand. Figure 20-2 shows how Bjoern set up the initial strategy
that Sariel used to pursue his objectives. Bjoern set up Sariel’s strategy and
activities and the general status of his operations at the start of the Avonlea
campaign.
Looking at the figure, you can see that Sariel has a lot of irons in the fire. With
these general guidelines, Bjoern was able to quickly decide on adventures
that fit into the overall plot, even though it took the party many months to
realize that one single personality was behind all the crises that they were
constantly being called upon to solve. We recommend that you do the same
thing to keep your adventures on track and further the overall plotline of
your campaign.

Part V: Building Your Own World 

Masterminds are not necessarily evil. A mastermind can be a, say, well-
intentioned scientist who accidentally releases a threat into the world. 
A mastermind doesn’t even have to be a person; it can be a deity or a force
of nature or anything else your imagination can create.
The mini-minds
We came up with the concept of mini-mind on our own. Very early in our sep-
arate careers as GMs, we learned to keep the party a long way away from
encountering the Mastermind until very late in the evolution of the plot. (In
one notable situation, a member of the party killed the Mastermind with a
single blow in the first combat of the first adventure in the first night of a cam-
paign. We learned our lesson after that.) Because of this, we created the con-
cept of the mini-mind.
Mini-minds are NPCs who, through their actions — again whether intentional
or unintentional — further the scenario that the Mastermind brought into
being. In the most typical type of campaign scenarios, these are the
Mastermind’s lieutenants or surrogates who act in his/her/its name. If we
used The Lord of the Rings as an example, then the various Nazgul and
Saruman would all be mini-minds to Sauron’s Mastermind. (Actually, Sauron
himself was only the highest-ranking mini-mind. Morgoth was the true
Mastermind of Tolkien’s world, even though he had been long-since van-
quished by the start of The Hobbit.)
We recommend that, after you’ve fully developed the Mastermind as an NPC,
you then do the same thing with the mini-minds. Pay more attention to the stats
with them, though; the party can conceivably encounter — and battle — the
mini-minds much more directly and perhaps even more frequently than they
ever will deal with the Mastermind. Coming up with a cadre of core “officers” in
the effort of your game world to prevent the party from achieving its goal —
especially if you develop their psychology in the process — gives you the
ability to operate on several different levels and come up with dramatically
different responses.
For example, in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign, four of the highest-level mini-
minds were the children of Sariel, each of whom had been made a lieutenant
in furthering Sariel’s objectives. These four children acted as the top-level
mini-minds of this stage of the campaign. Each of them had his or her own
psychology, loyalties, ambitions, and rivalries, as well as his or her own magi-
cal abilities and military forces. Thus, Sariel’s eldest son, Sarash, despised his
twin sister Sasha and spent as much energy attempting to foil Sasha from
earning their father’s favor as he did in trying to bring about the downfall of
the heroes.
325
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Sariel’s second son, Seraph, was a coward — anytime the party made signifi-
cant headway against Seraph’s efforts, he would pull out and flee the field
(usually abandoning his underlings to serve as a rear guard, of course) in
order to protect his own hide — which forced the party to deal with him
again and again, to their great frustration.
326
Part V: Building Your Own World 
Dealing with the Enemy disadvantage
Disadvantage: Enemy Variable.
GMs have dealt with seeing this entry in a PC’s
character sheet in many different ways; some
good, others less-than-good. Some GMs have
allowed their entire plotlines to be derailed as a
PC goes on a personal vendetta to destroy his
foe. We’ve also seen campaigns in which a
character with a valuable Enemy hasn’t faced
his foe over dozens of gaming sessions because
the GM doesn’t want to deal with the hassle of
creating new NPCs and coming up with a sce-
nario that doesn’t further the plot; making the
Enemy disadvantage a free source of points that
never truly affects the character.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We suggest that
you take one of three tacks when faced with the
Enemy disadvantage.
 Don’t allow your players to determine the
identity of their Enemy. Then you can make
the Enemy one of the mini-minds (or even
the Mastermind) of your campaign, so that
dealing with this foe actually gives the play-
ers a motivation to further your plotline.
 Allow the players to determine who their
Enemy is, but then secretly make the Enemy
one of the mini-minds of the campaign and
incorporate them into the scenario through
an avenue that you hadn’t initially con-
ceived of.
 Allow the players to determine the identity
of their Enemy, but make this foe someone
who possesses crucial knowledge, a key
component, or some other vital factor that
the party must acquire before they can van-
quish the Mastermind. This can be a really
fun variant — you could set it up so that the
party and the Mastermind both strive to
gain this factor from the Enemy character. 
In all cases of Enemies or any other advantage
or disadvantage a PC might have, we advocate
that you find a way to turn it into something that
furthers your plotline, even if you have to fudge
on the information that the player thinks is true
in order to do it.
You need to find ways to have the Enemy char-
acter create more problems for the character
who took the disadvantage than for the rest of
the party. If you just make the Enemy a foe for
the whole party, the whole party should get
points for it or else none of them should. You
have to balance this so that you’re not spending
a lot of gaming time focusing on a single char-
acter’s issues and making the other players sit
around, uninvolved and twiddling their thumbs.
The party must understand that if they share the
benefits of some PC’s advantages (such as
Wealth or a Patron), then they also share the
penalties of some disadvantages (like an Enemy)
as well.

Having lieutenants, each with his or her own personalities and forces,
allowed Bjoern to develop diverse strategies and tactics within the disparate
forces that owed Sariel allegiance. When they came to know the different
mini-minds and their eccentricities, the party was able to predict with
some measure of accuracy the way in which each faction of Sariel’s forces
would attempt to deal with them. Figure 20-3 shows Sariel’s organization
with his primary lieutenants and their responsibilities and powers. Note
that this is only a partial list — most of the underlings had their own 
subordinates.
Continuing with the Avonlea example, the first of Sariel’s brood that the party
tangled with directly was Seraph, the Huntsman. In the very first adventure,
one of the PCs realized that her husband had been murdered and her son had
been cursed by the forces of the Darkness (the work of Sarash) and she fled
her home to seek the aid of her sisters. One of Seraph’s jobs was to run down
anyone who could reveal Sariel’s plots, and he tracked the party the length
and breadth of Avonlea, attacking them whenever he could catch them in a
vulnerable position. As mentioned previously, Seraph was a coward; he chased
the party over hundreds of miles — and they even knew who he was — but
every time they got within striking distance, he would order some minions to
engage in suicidal attacks so that he could get away.
Figure 20-3:
Sariel’s
organi-
zational
structure.
327
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

However, he had other duties to perform (terrorizing the peasantry whenever
they were left exposed by their overlords among the Kindred), and his
Sadism demanded that he take at least one prisoner alive to torture at his
leisure. This weakness eventually gave the party a means of tracking him
down and destroying his power base, ending his usefulness to his father.
Ultimately, Sariel (acting upon the psychological imperatives that Bjoern
established for him at character creation) sacrificed his own son because of
this, and the party was able to eliminate one of their greatest foes, in part
through his own fallibility. Figure 20-4 shows the first portion of Seraph’s
character sheet. Notice that along the right side is a description of the char-
acter’s history and motivations. The party who played in the Avonlea cam-
paign was frequently frustrated by Seraph’s cowardice, but they eventually
found a way to use his Sadism to effect his downfall.
We think this is a good illustration of why it’s in your best interest as a GM to
get your important adversaries’ psychology firmly established before your
campaign ever starts. From the very first time the party encountered a village
that had been raided by Seraph’s forces, Bjoern was able to lay a trail of clues
(based upon Seraph’s disadvantages and objectives) that was able to consis-
tently point the party in a direction that ultimately gave them the means to
achieve his downfall. If Bjoern had waited to create Seraph until the first time
the party actually met him face-to-face (months and months after the start of
the campaign), he wouldn’t have been able to do that.

Minions
Without his Storm Troopers (or his Clones), the Emperor of the Star Wars
universe would not have been anything more than a personal menace with a
great need for a plastic surgeon and a better fashion consultant. And where
would Sauron have been without his orcs? The great power of most Master-
minds lies with their minions — the faceless hordes who exist to do (literally)
only the Mastermind’s bidding and work their evil upon the game world. The
distinguishing feature of minions is that they are generic. Whether they’re orcs,
Storm Troopers, street thugs, robots, or everyday folk who are controlled by
an intelligent virus, they are all basically the same and can be represented by a
single set of statistics, as demonstrated by the minions displayed in Figure 20-5.
In the figure, the columns are organized so that Bjoern can merely copy and
paste the first row of each listing into the Combat Grid that he uses to manage
tactical scenarios (as discussed in Chapter 14).
For the most part, the figure shows you pretty much all you need for each
classification of minion. Now, if your campaign distinguishes between
“Orc: Tracker” and “Orc: Warrior,” then you may want to make separate
entries for the different types of orc — that is up to you. The key thing 
here is that you can field literal armies of foes for your party — or even
dozens of different combat scenarios — all using the same NPC minions
over and over again.
You can create variations of one or two points in different stats, or even
simply arm your minions with slightly different weapons — for example, sub-
stituting a Javelin for a Sabre. Little changes like this can be done on the fly
and take next to no time to make, but they make the players believe that each
foe is unique.

Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Making the Most out of the 
Good Guys — The Cronies
Your game world will be a very cold, inhospitable, and hostile place if the PCs
don’t have someone they can rely on for aid and comfort when the going gets
tough. And you’ll have a tough time keeping them motivated in their efforts if
there isn’t some kind of reward — beyond heaps and mounds of treasure —
that they can experience, even if it is just official recognition from their peers,
friends, and neighbors for a job well done. One way to help is through the use
of crony NPCs. We’re using the term crony to describe those NPCs who are
friendly to or allied with the player characters and are supportive of their
actions and adventures.
Like adversaries, crony NPCs come in several different categories: 
 Superiors: More powerful characters, such as Patrons and rulers.
 Equals: Characters of a strength nearly equivalent to that of the party,
such as Allies, companions, and Contacts.
 Support Staff: Characters weaker than the party, like Dependents,
groups of weaker Allies, and other incidental personalities.
These categories are discussed more fully in the next few sections.
Patrons and Controls: Managing your plots
A Patron is an advantage and can either be a single NPC or an organization
within the game world. In either case, the Patron has for some reason
decided to look out for the best interests, causes, or well-being of the PC(s)
with the advantage, and therefore, the Patron can be called upon for assis-
tance. A Control is our word for a Patron that the PC owes a Duty to, and
whom the GM can use to directly influence the actions of the PC and hence
the development of the campaign. All Controls are Patrons, but not all
Patrons are Controls. Throughout this section, we talk about decisions you
need to make about Patron NPCs.
From a player perspective, a Patron can be a great investment of points — it
gives that character someone who can be called to come charging in in the
nick of time to save the character (and hopefully the rest of the party) from
certain death. Sound good? It can be — sometimes too good.
As a GM, you need to think carefully whenever someone wants her character
to get a Patron. Patrons can be a double-edged sword for the campaign if
330
Part V: Building Your Own World 

they’re not handled with caution. They can be a great means of giving the
party the information or some fancy widget that it needs, and they can be
great for pulling the party’s bacon out of the fire if things go horribly wrong
on an adventure. But they can also be potential sources of conflict between
party members, especially if the Patron is a Control that pulls the PC’s loyal-
ties away from the party (which we think is never a good idea), or they can
turn into a crutch for the GM who takes self-determination and personal
responsibility away from the players, which can result in disgruntled and lazy
players (see the sidebar, “Avoiding deus ex machina”). You should consider
the following questions when setting up Patron NPCs in your campaign:
 What is the nature of the Patron? Is the Patron a single powerful indi-
vidual, or an entire organization? If you choose to go with a single pow-
erful individual, then you most likely will need to create the Patron as a
fully developed NPC (just as if she were a Mastermind — or at least a
mini-mind) because the chances are that on at least a few occasions, the
Patron will wind up helping the PC during combat. If the Patron is an
organization, then the party will deal with NPCs who are the agents of
the Patron; in most cases, the agent characters can be handled simply
by treating them as a template and then developing the objectives and
strategic approach for the organization. Controls can be either individ-
ual or organizational Patrons.
 What is the basis of the relationship between the player character and
the Patron? This is much more than the standard relationship between
a boss and employee — the typical boss isn’t going to stick his neck out
to rescue an employee who has gotten into trouble during an off-the-clock
adventure. Having a boss as a Patron is pretty much appropriate only if
the PC was adventuring as a part of her job — in which case, the Patron is
a Control. If a Patron is not in a Control position, the best way to think of
the relationship is that the PC is the Patron’s dependent — and to consider
the nature of the relationship then as limiting the Patron’s freedom to act
against the PC’s best interests.
 Who gets to choose the identity of a character’s Patron? The benefit of
letting the GM choose Patrons is that (hopefully) your party won’t have
two or more Patrons with conflicting interests or agendas. You can even
use the same Patron for every party member who has the Patron advan-
tage. Although the Patron advantage suggests guidelines for adjusting
the usefulness of the Patron based on the proportion of the party for
whom the Patron’s appearance roll is a success, the reality is that if the
Patron appears, the help will be shared among the entire party. The
downside of this is that the Patron advantage, in effect, dictates that the
entire party receives the benefits of associating with the Patron, whether
the individual PCs have paid the points for the Patron or not. If you’re
inclined to use Controls, then we really recommend that you insist on
determining — or at least approving the selection of — the identity of
the Patron for each character.
331
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

 Is the Patron advantage required for some or all of the PCs? Requiring
all PCs to have the Patron advantage is desirable or reasonable in many
types of campaigns, especially if the Patron is a Control. It is perfectly
reasonable to require everyone to take the Patron advantage if, for
example, you run a Special Ops or Espionage campaign in which all the
PCs are agents of some organization. Another similar type of campaign
(requiring a Control) is one in which the game world has a feudal-style
society; in these cases, an individual’s social position is based upon
whom he owes allegiance to and who owes allegiance to him. A charac-
ter who does not have a Patron in a campaign of this type would be con-
sidered an outlaw or barbarian and viewed with hostility and fear. These
are just a few examples; there are certainly other situations in which a
campaign naturally demands that every PC take the Patron advantage —
including the perfectly valid reason of GM whim. Another option we use
when we want everyone in the party to share a Control is to describe the
Control as a required Duty, which does not count toward the campaign’s
disadvantage limitations. The Duty is then balanced by a Patron and not
recorded on the character’s sheet. (For example, if your party has a
15 point Patron to whom they owe a –15 point Duty.)
 What type of aid will the Patron grant to a player character? A Patron
can assist a PC in many ways that justify the expenditure of points for
the advantage, perhaps too many. Some of the types of assistance that
Patrons can provide are
• Training in new skills
• The use of expensive, experimental, or highly advanced equipment
• Healing between adventures — perhaps even cloning or resurrec-
tion in the event of death
• Refuge and sanctuary from pursuit
• A venue to sell or fence the party’s ill-gotten gains
• A reliable source of information
• Rescue when the PC is captured
• Combat support when the going gets too rough
Regardless of what you decide, the parameters of the relationship should be
spelled out with the PC at the outset. If the Patron is an elderly Sorceress
who is willing to teach the PC new spells, she is most likely not going to be
willing to also break into the Warlord’s castle to break the PC out of the dun-
geon. Feel free to set whatever limits you wish upon exactly what support the
Patron can provide a PC.
One of the benefits of using Patrons as Controls is that it creates a tremen-
dous amount of leverage on both characters and players to pursue the plot-
line. So, your party refused to follow the clue (or they ignored it) that they
needed to investigate the Old Crossroads Cemetery, did they? Not to worry, it
332
Part V: Building Your Own World 

just so happens that the mage PC’s Control (which is an arm of the Mages’
Guild) has just ordered the player character to collect a vital spell ingredient;
which just happens to be the dust on the tombstone of one specific grave . . .
One of the problems we have encountered with Patrons is that the players
come to expect — and sometimes demand — that the Patron will do what
they want. Now that they’ve identified the eldritch evil in the Old Farmhouse,
say, they expect the Patron to go deal with it for them. Our response when
this has happened is for the Patron to chuckle and say to the party, “You’re
right. I should take care of the matter. The assignment is yours.” This, of
course, is when the PCs’ having a Duty to the Patron comes in so handy.
Both GMs and players need to keep the difference between plain old Patrons
and Controls clear in their minds. To illustrate this, let’s look at superspy 
007 — the movie version, not James Bond as Ian Fleming wrote him. Who is
Bond’s Patron? If you immediately thought of MI6, you’d be only partially 
correct. Yes, Bond is an agent of MI6; he owes the agency an Extremely
Hazardous Duty and takes his orders from M. But is MI6 his Patron? MI6 does
not have a policy of sending other agents to extricate him from the clutches
of the mad Mastermind du jour, but Mr. Bond does get all those nifty widgets
from Q. And it is those widgets — whether it be the laser wristwatch or the
nerve gas in the key ring — that James uses to win his way free.
So, yes, because of Q and his widgets, the Duty disadvantage is offset by a
Patron advantage. Representing the relationship with both the Duty and the
Patron emphasizes that MI6 is not only a Patron, but is a Control Patron. MI6
itself then has its own Patron — the British government, which is the route
through which any tactical force aid must be provided.
Separately, in quite a few movies, a CIA agent named Felix Leiter shows up
because he’s on the same case as Bond. Even though they owe each other
nothing and they work for different agencies for different countries, Felix is
able to make available the logistical — and occasionally tactical — resources
that Bond needs to complete his mission. Because the CIA ultimately fur-
nishes these resources, we would argue that James has paid the points to
take the CIA as a Patron as well as MI6 (or perhaps the U.S. Government as
well as the British Government).
You should also always keep in mind the difference between the actual
Patron and the Patron’s agent. The actual Patron may never directly appear in
the adventure. Keeping with the example of our favorite British spy, we can
unequivocally state that no Bond movie has ever included either of Bond’s
Patron characters — the actual government organizations can, at best, only
intervene by sending individuals to act on its behalf. Q certainly is not his
Patron, because he acts only upon orders from someone else in MI6 (other-
wise he’d never give Bond all those gadgets that Bond never manages to
return). Q and various British forces that step in to help Bond are the
Patron’s agents in dealing with Bond, but not the Patrons themselves.

If you’re creating a Patron who is a very powerful individual, you need to go
through much the same process as you would to create a Mastermind —
you really need to know what makes this person tick and be able to play
him in a combat situation if that ever comes about. You may also want to
create some additional lieutenants for the Patron as well. One thing you
ought to think about with an individual Patron: What do you do if the Patron
character dies?
Fourth-edition GURPS allows deities to act as Patrons as well. Such Patrons
behave differently: they rarely (if ever) appear personally; their agents can be
omens, passersby, or animals; and their favored ones owe them faith and
devotion, if not a Duty. Most importantly, the god chooses what aid to give,
and the supplicant’s appeals to affect that choice are only as good as the
player’s role playing of the prayers.

Avoiding deus ex machina
Deus ex machina is a term from the Classical
Greek and Roman theater. It refers to the char-
acter of a god who descends into the action of
the play to suddenly resolve the situation and
save the hero. In literature, it has come to mean
an improbable, artificial, or unexpected device
or character used by the writer to untangle a
plot; it’s a term usually loaded with contempt for
a writer who let things get out of hand.
Some GMs are prone to use Patron or Ally NPCs
as their own deus ex machina — usually either
because they are unwilling to let the party mem-
bers act as independent beings, or because
they’ve allowed their campaign’s plot to com-
pletely go off course. Anytime you feel tempted
to have any NPC simply step in, take matters
into their own hands, and fix things (even little
things) for the party, you have succumbed to the
lure of deus ex machina.
Please don’t do this. When we’ve had GMs do
this, we’ve quite frankly been insulted at the
implication that we aren’t capable of getting
ourselves out of the mess we’re in. Introducing
an NPC as a deus ex machina makes us feel
devalued, and it tends to cheapen the campaign
for us — if a GM does it more than a couple of
times, we’ll simply withdraw and refuse to play
in that GM’s campaigns any more. And that is
the harshest criticism a GM can face.
How can you avoid getting to this point? You
need to always remember that, although your
players think they want the Patron to rescue
their characters, what they want is for their
characters to have the chance to rescue them-
selves. For example, if the character is impris-
oned in the Dark Tower, you could have the
Patron come blasting her way in to break the
party free. If you do, the party may be grateful,
but they will also be resentful; they will probably
feel more like sidekicks and tag-a-longs rather
than who they should be — the central charac-
ters in the campaign. Instead, the Patron could
arrange to have a key to the dungeon smuggled
into their cell. The party will still have to over-
power the guards, fight their way to the exit, and
make their escape. When or if the party does
manage to win its way free, they will be jubilant
at what they managed to accomplish with the
assistance — not the interference — of the
Patron NPC.

If the Patron is an organization, you will need to create a few characters who
function as the Patron’s agents; for 007, we’d make sure that we had the psy-
chology (if nothing else) figured out for M, Q, and Moneypenny on the MI6 side;
for the CIA, we’d have a character sheet for Felix Leiter so we could use him in
combat, as well as several different templates of SEALs, Marines, RAF, Navy,
and shuttle-launched Space Rangers to act as the cavalry riding to the rescue.
Allies and Companions: Giving 
the party an edge
Within the James Bond universe, Felix Leiter isn’t an Ally because his aid
comes in the form of the resources of the CIA rather than his own abilities. A
more appropriate character to think of as one of his Allies would be the char-
acter of Wai Lin, played by Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies. She is an
agent for the External Security Agency of the People’s Republic of China, but
because of a shared agenda, she teams up with Bond to destroy Elliot Carver
(a Mastermind who attempts to start a war between Great Britain and China
in order to improve television ratings). Wai Lin doesn’t bring the resources of
her own organization to Bond’s aid, merely her own considerable abilities.
Just like with Patrons, the Ally advantage gives a player character the benefit
of the support of an NPC. The difference between the advantages is that the
Ally is considered more of a peer than a superior. Allies typically cannot bring
the resources of the Patron to the benefit of the player character; instead
they bring their own presence and abilities to support the activities of the
player character. We think of Allies as coming in three distinct flavors:
 Sidekicks
 Companions
 Ally groups
These are discussed more fully in the next few sections.
Sidekicks
Allies do not have to be combat-oriented characters. In fact, in our experi-
ence, Allies are most helpful to the PCs when they are primarily supportive
noncombatants; hence the label of sidekick. Think of how important Watson is
to Sherlock Holmes, Sancho Panza is to Don Quixote, or Alfred is to Batman,
and you’ll get what we mean. Supportive noncombatant NPC Allies can do a
great deal in supporting the player character that they are allied to; whether
it’s providing a cover that allows the PC to go off adventuring, assured in the
knowledge that his home and business life continues running like normal, or
it’s providing logistical and technical support for the PC during the adventure.
335
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Although the player gets to determine whether his or her character gets an
Ally, you may not want to let the player create the Ally character, and you
certainly should not let the player determine the Ally’s actions during play. If
you do let the player create the Ally, you might want to consider making
some changes to the character by the time the campaign starts and not allow
the player to see the Ally’s character sheet again. Sidekick Allies are not sec-
ondary PCs that exist solely for the benefit of the player’s PC. They should be
fully realized characters with the advantages, disadvantages, hopes, dreams,
fears, and quirks of their own. Likewise, they should not simply acquiesce to
the whims and demands of the PC; you need to give them personal lives of
their own — lives that sometimes interfere with their usefulness to the play-
ers who paid the points for them.
Likewise, remember that an Ally NPC is the Ally only of the individual PC,
not of the entire party. For example, in a party of costumed crime fighters,
one of the player characters (who goes by the name of Amethyst) aug-
ments her own powers with the gadgets that she gets from an Ally who 
is a Gadgeteer. Just because Amethyst gets a bunch of cool toys to use on
adventures doesn’t mean that her friend is going to give them to the other
party members. If the other players in the group start nagging the GM or
Amethyst to get some of those goodies, the GM ought to let them have the
goodies — and then charge them the character points to take the same NPC
as an Ally.
We’ve seen many GMs keep the party’s Allies completely in the background
as personality-free cardboard cut-outs that can provide a needed service on
demand but nothing else. This is a huge mistake. You can really make a mark
on a campaign and make it memorable by doing more than throw new and
bigger monsters at the party. What can make a campaign memorable is how
much the players get emotionally invested in the lives of their characters,
and Allies can go a long way toward creating that investment. 
Companions
The official GURPS rules do not have a mechanism for (but do not prohibit
either) another sort of Ally character that we have occasionally found
very useful. To distinguish them from the conventional Ally, we call them
Companions. Companion characters are NPCs who team up with the party
for one or more adventures. They are created and run by the GM and could
essentially be considered to be “PCs for the GM” (something very distinct
from other types of NPCs). Their presence does not cost the players any
points, and the players have no claim on dictating the actions of the
Companion any more than they can dictate the actions of another PC.
336
Part V: Building Your Own World 

As GMs, we insert a Companion into a party when we feel that the composi-
tion of the party needs rounding out. Perhaps your party consists of a bunch
of bloodthirsty barbarians and you can’t get anyone to create a character
with adequate healing abilities. Or perhaps you’ve created an adventure that
requires someone with a specific set of skills (or even a specific individual
skill) that no one in the party has and you don’t want to show your hand by
even hinting that they learn them. Or maybe you just want to be able to be a
player as well as GM. For whatever reason, a Companion is a perfectly accept-
able NPC who gives you lots of opportunities for emotionally investing the
players in the campaign.
Bjoern is notorious for creating an NPC who turns into a love interest for one
of the party members, and includes the love interest in an adventure or two
before having her go off to do something else, like becoming the sheriff of a
small town — sometimes while still maintaining the relationship with the PC.
When this happens, the party finds that they become bound up with the for-
tunes of the Companion, and this can be used as a hook to get the party
involved in a scenario at any time in the future. If the paramour/sheriff NPC
calls on the party for help because all of the corpses in the local cemetery are
rising from their graves and attacking the living, the party will be much more
immediately focused and involved in dealing with this threat than if they were
called upon by an NPC that they have a more ambiguous relationship with.
Companions do not have to be “good guys.” If you want to instill a lot of para-
noia in your party, give them a Companion who is a sleeper — an agent for
one of the party’s enemies who joins them, earns their trust, learns their
secrets, and then betrays them to his true employer. If the party survives the
experience, we guarantee that their level of paranoia will be ratcheted up by
several degrees.
You can also insert Companions into a party with the deliberate intention of
killing the NPC. Why? Depending upon the power level and tech level of your
campaign, actually killing a PC during play can be very difficult. Also, we find
that our players (including ourselves) tend to personally identify more with
our GURPS characters than with characters we’ve created and played in other
gaming systems. GURPS is designed so that players are prone to become much
more emotionally invested in their characters. After all, they may have spent
weeks fine-tuning the character before they began to play her. And GURPS
campaigns tend to include more role playing than your average hack-’n-slash
dungeon crawl, and that helps players identify with their characters as well.
For whatever reason, having your GURPS character die can be a truly trau-
matic experience. The purpose of role playing games is to have fun, not to be
traumatized, and killing PCs is not necessarily good for most campaigns.
337
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

But you don’t want your players to start taking their invulnerability for
granted. They need to feel the thrill and fear of death but may not need to
experience it. You can solve this by including an NPC Companion who, when
you feel it is appropriate or necessary, you target for death during combat.
You don’t want to do this often, and you don’t want to go out of your way to
slaughter an NPC Companion just to manipulate the party’s emotions, but it
is an appropriate and effective means of creating a campaign that your play-
ers will get excited about and invested in.
Don’t let your Allies and Companions outshine and outperform the charac-
ters run by the players. As the GM, you have to be cautious when running
any NPC Ally so that the character only knows the information that is 
appropriate for him to know. This requires you to develop a sort of multiple
personality. Even if the party is stymied over a riddle, puzzle, or mystery,
you should never have your Ally or Companion solve it for the party —
doing so just becomes a form of deus ex machina. Check out the sidebar,
“Avoiding deus ex machina,” to get the lowdown on this dangerous plot
device.
Likewise, regardless of the die rolls, the Ally or Companion should not be the
one to make the killing blow in combat or take the key action to resolve a sit-
uation because doing so takes that opportunity away from the players, and
they will feel cheated. It is fine to have an NPC join the party in combat, but if
you’ve made him so tough that he outshines the PCs, the players will resent
you for it. (And if the NPC is a liability or is incompetent, they’ll resent you
even more.)
Ally Groups
Ally Groups are essentially the minions that a player character can acquire.
The official GURPS rules state that an Ally Group consists of six or more 
identical and interchangeable NPCs that the player character can have at a
“bulk discount.” This means that you essentially create a template to handle
all NPCs covered by this advantage. We encourage you to go a little further
in order to create the appearance that each member of the Ally Group is a
unique individual without it affecting combat significantly. As an example,
imagine that your campaign is based in an urban blight scenario in which
thugs and street gangs are at the top of the social pecking order, and a PC
decides to pay for the privilege of having one of those street gangs — the
Screaming Leopards — as an Ally Group. The player pays the points for 
6 to 10 NPCs, and you determine that the group has a total of 8 members, all
with identical combat statistics. Table 20-1 shows the information you could
come up with to individualize the different members of this group — at least
as far as the player is concerned.

With just a few lines of text per person, we’ve created eight unique personali-
ties with their own strengths and weaknesses that don’t affect how they are
played in combat, but these “personalities” give the PC information that
339
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

makes each one seem different from the rest. Of course, if the PC had an Ally
Group that was any larger than this handful of people, you wouldn’t want to
do a separate entry for each person, but you wouldn’t have to. Simply having
the profiles for a few different people is enough to keep most players feeling
like you’ve worked like a dog to make each and every member of their Ally
Group a unique individual.
Contacts: Providing information 
and resources
A Patron is willing to expend significant resources to see to the well-being 
of a PC. An Ally will go to considerable effort and risk on the PC’s behalf. A
Contact will do neither. According to the rules, a Contact provides informa-
tion or does a favor for the PC, but only if that favor meets at least two out 
of these three criteria:
 It must be quick.
 It must be nonhazardous.
 It must be inexpensive.
Fortunately, Contacts — and Contact Groups — are, on the whole, less expen-
sive than either Patrons or Allies.
Individual Contacts are categorized by their effective skill in one specific skill,
and then by their Frequency of Appearance, and Reliability. Contact Groups are
grouped the same way, except that rather than being called upon for only one
skill, a Contact Group can be used for a single category of skills. For example, a
PC could take the local Thieves’ Guild as a Contact Group for information that
could be known with a collection of Thief skills, rather than a specific thief as
an individual Contact who could answer only the questions that a person with
the skill of Pickpocket would know. Contact Groups are, therefore, much more
useful — and they are five times more expensive than individual Contacts.
The key thing about Contacts is that neither the players nor their characters
should be absolutely certain about the Contact’s true allegiances or motiva-
tions. With the exception of Unwilling Allies (which cost significantly less)
and the potential that a Companion Ally is an agent of their adversaries, the
individual PCs can usually be pretty confident that their Allies and Patrons
have the same, or similar, agendas as their own and are concerned for the
PC’s well-being.
340
Part V: Building Your Own World 

However, the same cannot be said for Contacts. Each Contact has her own
agenda that may or may not be sympathetic to the PC and his cause. This is
in part covered by the Reliability rating for the Contact, which affects the
total cost of the Contact. The lower the Reliability rating, the more likely the
Contact will provide false information or notify the PC’s enemy of the PC’s
interests.
We don’t think that player characters should be able to determine the
Reliability rating of their Contacts; player characters should never be certain
about where they stand with a Contact. To reflect this, when a PC wants to
acquire a Contact, we recommend dictating a point cost without breaking it
down between skill level, Frequency of Appearance, and Reliability, and tell
the player only the total point cost — not the breakdown.
Another difference among Contacts, Patrons, and Allies is that Contacts and
Contact Groups expect more of an equal exchange of favors and information
than Patrons or Allies. If a PC is not willing to make favors and information a
two-way street, or is not willing to pay a bribe, then the Contact’s well of
information ought to start drying up. The official rules state that a bribe can
give a +1 to +4 to the Reliability roll. We think that these bonuses should
apply to a bribe (or service, or donation) that is above an equivalent
exchange of favors between the Contact and the PC.
When we establish a Contact NPC (or Contact Group), then we make a
brief entry with the name, what the PC knows of their affiliation, their effec-
tive skill level in which skill or group of skills, Frequency of Appearance,
Reliability, and the Contact’s true allegiance (based upon his or her Reliability
rating). The player determines the Frequency of Appearance and Reliability
based upon the number of points he paid for his character’s Contact, but
the GM (and only the GM) gets to determine where that Contact’s true alle-
giance lies. For example, let’s say the PC takes a Contact who is a local cop
with a Reliability rating of Somewhat Reliable. That means he has some
other agenda the party may not be aware of. Perhaps he is also on the
payroll of a local mob boss. If he is, and he finds out that the party is inves-
tigating said mob boss, he is going to notify the gangster of the party’s 
interest regardless of the die roll. Now, if the party is investigating another
mob boss, he wouldn’t necessarily let that person know — but if the mobster
he’s associated with goes down, then, as a crooked cop on the payroll, he will
likely go down as well, and he’s going to protect his own interests first, not
the party’s.
341
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Leading the Party by the Nose —
Dependable Dependents
We call Dependents “dependable” because, as GMs, we can always count on
motivating the party with a threat to that Dependent’s well-being. And for
Dependents to be a legitimate disadvantage that justifies their negative point
value, the GM must — at least occasionally — integrate a threat to his well-
being into the plotline of the campaign.
As the GM, you have the right — indeed it is part of your job — to put a limit
on any disadvantage (including Dependents) that is not appropriate for your
campaign. In some types of campaigns, a PC having a Dependent is very 
inappropriate — and highly improbable — especially a high-point-value
Dependent, which is almost always a small child. Most responsible parents, if
they know they have to go into danger, will find an alternate caretaker for
their children while they’re away, in which case the parent no longer has a
Dependent because someone else has assumed temporary responsibility for
the child.
Keep in mind that there is a difference between a situation where the player
knows that the character will be taking a Dependent into danger, and where
the character knows he will be taking a Dependent into danger. For example,
there is a significant difference between starting a campaign with a character
and his small daughter boarding a plane bound for London — even though
the player suspects that the plane is going to end up someplace like the
Bermuda Triangle — and a character and his small daughter boarding an
experimental FTL ship en route to explore the vast unknown. In the first
example, the character does not know he’s putting his child at risk, and the
Dependent is a perfectly legitimate disadvantage. In the second, he’s know-
ingly and willingly putting his daughter into a dangerous situation, and we
would rule that the character could earn no character points for as long as
the child was at risk.
Of course, many more types of relationships exist between a PC and her
Dependent than simply parent and child; that’s simply the most easily
described and understood. If a player is interested in taking a Dependent, 
you should encourage him to consider some of the other options as well.
Anyone can be a Dependent for a PC, provided the Dependent has a lower
point value than the PC and the PC has accepted responsibility for that NPC’s
welfare and safety.
342
Part V: Building Your Own World 

All disadvantages exist to create problems for the characters — a disadvantage
that doesn’t create problems shouldn’t be worth any points. Dependents, like
Enemies, have the added appeal of causing problems completely under the con-
trol of the GM and can therefore be easily adapted to further the campaign’s
plotline. However, the kidnap-the-hero’s-kid-so-that-he-has-to-brave-the-terrors-
of-the-bad-guy’s-domain-to-rescue-the-kid scenario can only be used once or
twice before it gets stale. The Dependent disadvantage is still worth your time,
though, considering other ways you can use a character’s Dependents to cause
him pain.
Keep in mind that Dependents are supposed to be free-willed beings — they
are not merely appendages of the PC who gained the points for the disadvan-
tage. They should have minds of their own, their own opinions, agendas,
motivations, and behavioral problems, all role played by you, the GM. And
the existence of the Dependent should cause problems for the campaign
every time you make the Frequency of Appearance roll for that particular
Dependent.
Including infants in a campaign would bring an adventure to a standstill —
there’d be no time for adventuring between stinky diapers, feedings, bathing,
colic, and all the other joys of parenthood — but you can include older
Dependents to make the PCs miserable without needing to involve an Enemy.
Teenagers (whether they are your character’s children, students, or appren-
tices) are going to be alternately sulky and rebellious and will need to be
dealt with regularly, even if it’s at a highly inappropriate time. Elderly or
infirm Dependents can inadvertently create chaos and disruption with their
health issues. Even healthy, active adult Dependents can decide that they
want a raise or have a policy dispute and require mediation right now, even if
it is inconvenient for the character. And consider the implications of the
mage’s Dependent who begins studying dark and forbidden magics against
the PC’s wishes.
We’ve seen GMs set up scenarios that have been downright sadistic in the
ways they’ve used Dependents to motivate or manipulate the party’s actions
and emotions. GURPS allows for so great a degree of character identification
that GMs need to be careful when using Dependents in this way, or they risk
traumatizing the players by the situation. Whenever possible, you should go
for the threat of harm rather than the infliction of harm. You’ll usually get
responses from the party that are just as strong (sometimes stronger) with
this threat as they would be with the actual infliction, and you save the NPC
for use again at a later date.
343
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Encountering the Outré — NPCs Who
Really Stand Out
Some of the most fun we’ve had with NPCs — as players and as GMs — has
been with those characters who didn’t have a point-based or plot-defined
relationship with anyone in the party. We can’t imagine a game world in
which every character that the PCs are going to meet is going to be either
allied with them or arranged against them. The vast majority of them are
going to be neutrally disposed, and — while they may not advance a specific
344
Part V: Building Your Own World 
Preventing Dependent abuse
We’ve found that players try to overinflate the
point value of a Dependent more often than any
other means of abusing the system, and we
have become pretty harsh and conservative in
what value we will set on a Dependent. Keep in
mind that the point value of a Dependent is
widely variable, depending upon the Depen-
dent’s competence, importance to the PC, and
frequency of appearance. As a disadvantage,
Dependents can be as insignificant as –1 point,
or they can be worth as much as –120 points!
Be very careful about what you approve in the
way of Dependents and consider the following:
As a standard baseline from personal experi-
ence, we use being a single parent and sole
caretaker of an infant as being worth –90 points.
This means that the Dependent character is
essentially a 0-point or lower character (at that
time) that has absolutely no ability to take care
of even its most basic needs (which is worth –15
points). It is a loved one, and its well-being takes
priority over all other considerations (which
doubles the point value to –30 points), and —
with no other ongoing caretaker — it needs
care and attention 95% of the time (rolling a 15
or less), which equates to 22.8 hours a day,
during which time the PC better try and rest (1.2
hours of sleep a day is just about what new par-
ents seem to get for the first few months). When
is a PC going to have time to go on an adventure
with that kind of responsibility?
Now, imagine your player says, “My character’s
mother can watch the baby at least a few hours
a day.” At this point, we chuckle evilly. It will be
great if Grandma takes care of the baby for 6
hours a day, which is 25 percent of the time;
that’s fairly close to being a “Quite often”
Frequency of Appearance roll (12 or less, or
74 percent of the time). That means that the
value of the darling child as a Dependent just
dropped from –90 points to –60 points.
The point we’re trying to make here is that the
greater the value of the Dependent, the more
that Dependent is going to consume anyone’s
available time and energy, and we really dislike
the concept of a PC bringing a completely help-
less infant into an adventure. Even a young child
(who is at least potty-trained, can feed himself,
and can run away in case of danger) is signifi-
cantly better, and can be justified (for a single
parent as sole caretaker) for as much as –60
points, but no more.

plotline — you can have a lot of fun spending one session or several sessions
with the PCs getting to know some interesting and eccentric characters in
your world. And sometimes you can hide a significant plot device in the guise
of a seemingly irrelevant encounter. 
Even in the most serious and convoluted campaigns, there is room for
whimsy, fun, and having a good laugh. Sometimes what a party needs isn’t a
new deadly peril to face, but an absurdity to unravel and enjoy. The players
will remember the bizarre but harmless encounters much more than they will
remember another dungeon full of nameless dread.
Providing Background Texture — 
Extras and Walk-ons
Finally, the last group of NPCs to discuss are all the other people in the world
who are not in the least involved with the cares and conflicts that consume
the party, otherwise known as the 99.99-percent majority. In most campaigns,
these characters barely exist even in the mind of the GM, let alone in the
player’s consciousness. A world where the vast majority of people aren’t con-
sidered, described, or integrated is mostly colorless and of interest only to
those gamers who want the hack-’n-slash dungeon-crawl, Monty Haul style.
(In other words, a world with plenty of foes to kill, no real thought or charac-
ter development, and an obscenely undeserved amount of treasure and
magic available.)
Creating the people in the background really isn’t that big of a deal if you give
it just a little bit of thought. You should start during the world-design stage of
your campaign development and come up with (at least) one visibly distinc-
tive quality about the style or fashion of dress for people in your culture. For
example, in Avonlea, every adult of either gender (except for women who
were pregnant or nursing) always wore a knife (called a skeiyn dbuh) promi-
nently upon their person as a sign that they were ready to defend their own
honor, even in a fight to the death. Anyone who did not wear a knife (and who
wasn’t willing to fight for their honor) could not be legally murdered, but was
considered to be a dishonorable coward and was treated as a social outcast
with a disfiguring communicable disease. Having this visually distinctive fea-
ture gives you an anchor to start building people’s awareness of others. What
is the condition of this or that person’s skeiyn dbuh? Where is it worn? Are
there regional differences for how or where it is worn? What does it mean
when there’s a green jewel in the pommel of a person’s skeiyn dbuh? You
don’t have to come up with definitive answers for any of these questions, just
let your players think that there are definitive and significant answers without
telling them anything.
345
Chapter 20: Creating Memorable NPCs

Next, we create a template for the Average-Joe-in-the-street and then a list of
15 or 20 NPC personalities, much like we did for the Ally Group in Table 20-1.
This just contains information like name, gender, social status, occupation,
condition of skeiyn dbuh (if it were Avonlea), one thing this person likes, and
one thing this person dislikes. In Avonlea, it was vital to also list their clan
and domain affiliations, but you certainly don’t need to go that far.
Whenever the party is in an environment where they need to interact with
the locals, have this list available. If they need to talk to someone, roll to ran-
domly pick one person from this list (or pick someone deliberately, it doesn’t
matter) and assume that persona. You have enough information to describe
them visually because the party has a cultural anchor to connect to (like the
skeiyn dbuh), and you’ll be surprised how quickly you’ll be able to fall into
the role and begin ad-libbing that character’s personality to have that simple
chat with the player character. You might think it was simple, but your play-
ers will be very impressed and get more interested in the game world and its
people because of it.
Populating your game world with a cast of seemingly unique individuals
doesn’t have to take a lot of work. Remember that you’re creating an illusion
that your players want to believe. Give them one distinctive thing about each
NPC they meet — whether it’s while clanking beer steins together in toast at
the local tavern, or crossing swords in mortal combat — and your players
will come to care about your world as if they really lived in it. Then, when
your Mastermind sends his hordes of Lovecraftian terrors into the streets to
feast on the brains of the innocent, the party will be much more horrified and
determined to protect the people at all costs.

B
y now we hope that you are aware that we believe that the traits that
distinguish a good GM from a great GM do not include the ability to
create bigger and nastier monsters or bigger and more spectacular treasure.
We believe that the key to being a great GM is the ability to craft a campaign
into an experience of shared storytelling that gets the players emotionally
invested in the plot to the point at which they aren’t concerned with the
immediate rewards of treasure or character points but in the ability to
achieve their characters’ objectives.
In the previous chapters of Part V, we walk you through many of the most sig-
nificant issues you have to address if you’re going to create a game world and
campaign of your own. While addressing these different issues, we repeatedly
touch on the importance of creating a game world that has the illusion of
vitality and life and involves the players as much in the minutiae of charac-
ters’ lives as in the great and epic events that the PCs (hopefully) experience.
Probably the best term to describe this quality is flavor.
A good role playing game ought to feed the imagination like a feast feeds the
body. Any gourmet can tell you that flavor is much more than just taste; it
embodies the entire sensory experience of sight, texture, smell, temperature,
and even sound. A great campaign is one that has a full, rich emotional flavor
that captures and delights the imaginations of the players the same way a
sumptuous feast captures and delights the appetites of the feasters. 
In the previous chapters, we talk about the basics of building a game world,
developing a plotline, and creating NPCs that your players will talk about for
years to come. In this final chapter of Part V, we try to give you the final tools
you need to turn your campaigns into truly remarkable feasts for your play-
ers’ imaginations.

Setting the Mood
Great GMing demands true artistry. Being a great GM is like being a great nov-
elist, musician, painter, or filmmaker; each one has the ability to convey spe-
cific emotions that the player, reader, listener, or viewer directly experiences.
This is the mood of a campaign; it is not something that you can write into a
world description, plotline, or NPC write-up. Creating a mood depends on
your delivery during the actual gaming sessions and requires that you be
descriptive, adaptive, flexible, and able to impersonate different characters at
the drop of a hat.
Don’t be intimidated. It really doesn’t have to be difficult, and everyone
improves with practice. The key quality that you must bring to your Game
Mastering in order to convey emotional content is a vivid imagination and the
ability to see the scenarios in the campaigns. One of the things that all of the
great GMs we’ve known have in common is that they have the ability to visu-
alize the settings and characters of their game worlds and then can convey
their vision to their players. It is not enough to simply describe a setting to
your players, you need to — at least part of the time — paint a verbal picture
of the scene for them.
Adding special effects
There are other tricks you can use to manipulate your player’s emotions. For
example, if the gaming session occurs in your home, you can manipulate the
thermostat and lighting levels to affect the moods of your players. If you turn
the thermostat down a few degrees (enough to give the players a slight chill),
they will tend to be more fearful; and if you turn it up a few degrees (enough
to make them slightly sweaty), they will tend to be more belligerent. If the
room you use for gaming has a rheostat on the lights, you can set it at a level
that is just slightly dimmer than comfortable — while still allowing people to
read clearly — and many people will experience some feelings of anxiety
because they’re struggling on a subconscious level in order to see; and lights
that are just slightly too bright will have an entirely different effect.
Of course, individual responses will be unique; these are simply very general
observations based on the people we’ve gamed with. Please note that all of
these techniques work only if you are subtle and sparing in their use. If the
players figure out what you’re doing, these techniques will no longer be as
effective — and may alienate some people as well. Be careful using them.
As the producers and directors of movies and television shows can attest,
using the appropriate background music can be a powerful tool for inducing
the desired emotional responses from your players. No, we’re not going to

Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Fright checks, critical failures, and other tables
Imagine that you’re playing in a campaign in
which the GM has done a good job of creating
an emotionally engaging milieu, and you and the
other players have become engrossed in the
action. You’re in the middle of combat, people
are excitedly chattering, and the adrenalin is
running high; a couple of party members have
already fallen and you’re afraid that your party
might not make it. Your character is suddenly
attacked by something particularly scary, and
the GM calls for you to make a Will roll. You roll
your dice and . . . oh no! An 18! That is 5 over
your character’s Will! Your character is in trou-
ble and your breath catches as your heart leaps
into your throat in fear. You grip the arms of your
chair waiting to hear the bad news. You hear the
ominous rumble of dice from behind the GM
screen and then you wait, almost ready to
scream in anxiety.
Finally, the GM looks up from behind the screen,
looks at you and says, “Uh, the Fright Check
table says that you panic and are going to run
around screaming or you can sit down and cry
for 1d minutes. You can make another Will roll
to get over it then.”
What?
What a let down! It sounds absurd, but you
probably feel gypped. Not by the result of the
Fright Check roll, but by how the GM conveyed
those results. Reading those results from the
book almost verbatim disrupted the illusion that
the GM had worked so hard to create. Although
it certainly didn’t affect the outcome of the
battle, now you don’t care quite as much as you
did a moment ago because the reality of the
game and the rules intruded at one of the most
emotionally charged moments.
So how should the GM have handled it? Start
with an evil chuckle. The GM then says, “You
lose it. You lose it completely. You stop thinking
or caring about anything but getting away. You
forget about the battle, you forget about your
friends, you even forget about the Toilet Brush
of the Elder Gods. You start screaming hysteri-
cally. You throw whatever you have in your
hands to the ground and you start running. 
Oh, later on — if you survive (again, an evil
chuckle) — you’ll discover that you wet your-
self in the process.”
GURPS uses several tables to provide the
results for especially good and bad die rolls
(critical successes, critical failures, backfires,
and so on) to determine the part of the body
struck by untargeted attacks (Hit Location table)
and to determine the results of losing control of
one’s fear (Fright Check table). Using these
tables can significantly enhance the quality of
playing the game, but only if they are handled
appropriately.
Regardless of how well you immerse your play-
ers in your game world, even the most adept
GMs can find it difficult to have to suddenly
translate the official rules into how they affect
the imaginary reality of the game world.
It takes flexibility, quick thinking, and imagina-
tion, but we urge you to strive to keep the rules
from affecting the game. Take the results of
those tables and do your best to translate them
into descriptions of the way the effects manifest
in your game world. Your players will thank you
for it.

give you a playlist of the best music for each milieu and mood — you can do
that for yourself. But just keep it in mind as you’re developing your cam-
paign. We suggest that you also play the appropriate mood music throughout
the process of creating your game world, building your campaign, and writing
your adventures. This is a good way of auditioning recordings for your scen-
arios and may generate emotional responses that stimulate your imagination.
You may want to create a list of musical pieces you want to associate with spe-
cific parts of your adventure and include the list in your campaign notes.
There are many more things you can do to set the mood for your players. Try
as many as you can think of. Yes, they require you to do more work, and
there is always the potential that your efforts will be flat-out failures, but the
satisfaction of knowing that you have been able to create a campaign that
your players talk about for years to come (or even better, a campaign that
causes your players to dream about their characters after the gaming ses-
sions) is more than ample reward for most GMs.
If your campaign is based on a movie or television series — or even just heav-
ily influenced by a movie or TV show — one thing you can do to set the mood
is to set up your gaming group to have a “Movie Night.” Get everyone together,
load the DVD of the movie or show, and allow your players to get immersed
into the milieu. If your campaign is based on a TV series, you could start each
gaming session with an episode of the TV show to get the players in the mood.
Thinking outside the box: Who says 
the world has to be round?
In a very early session of one of Adam’s campaigns, he announced to the
group that the world we were adventuring in was not a sphere — it was
shaped like a burrito. Furthermore, this world possessed two moons; one
moon was the home of the gods of this world, and the other moon was a
world-sized sleeping serpent coiled in on itself.
These little tidbits of information never came to practical use in this particu-
lar campaign — our party never tried to circumnavigate the burrito, and we
never tried to travel to either moon — but it still altered the players’ aware-
ness of the game world. If there was such a profound change in something so
fundamental as the shape of the world, that meant that natural phenomena
could not be predicted to act the way we expect phenomena to act on Earth,
and we couldn’t take even something so basic as gravity for granted. We had
to let go of our assumptions about anything — not only in comparing Adam’s
game world to the real world, but also in comparing Adam’s game world to
any other game world.

Avonlea visualization
“I would like you all to sit back, get comfortable,
and close your eyes. Take a deep breath and let
it all the way out, letting out tension as you
exhale. Relax. I want you to use the inner eye 
of your imagination to see the world that I 
will describe: the world of Uerth, the world of
Avonlea.
“You get to first experience Uerth the same way
that the Dalesmen of Avonlea first encountered
their land: by entering through a Gate. In your
mind, I want you to see a rectangle of darkness
that appears to have depth to it; it is encased in
a frame of light that sparks and flashes as if it
were a conduit of static electricity, except that
you’ve never seen an electrical charge that
glowed this shade of orange. You take another
deep breath, let it out slowly, and step into the
deep black, and your awareness of this world
vanishes and you find yourself elsewhere.
“The air smells much different than what you’re
used to. It is cleaner, richer, more primal. You
smell a mix of ozone, pine sap, crushed moss,
and the scent of rain. The air is damp and sends
chills up your arms and along the back of your
neck. You look back and see the rough-hewn
stone of a dolmen altar; the vertical stones are
at least twelve feet tall and at least five feet in
diameter, the crosspiece is of equal size and
weight. All three stones are a rich, royal blue; a
color you’ve never seen appear in natural stone
on your home world. Inside the menhir, you see
the same crackling orange light before it quickly
fades away to nothing. You see that you are sur-
rounded by other dolmens that are basically
identical to the one you just stepped through;
there are at least ten other portals formed into a
ring, but at the moment they are all quiescent.
Your gaze rises to look beyond the dolmen
circle, and you see that you are surrounded by
tree-covered hills on all sides.
“From your vantage point, you can see millen-
nia-old cedar trees reaching hundreds of feet
into the air, and with a trunk diameter larger
than many houses. You see hemlock with nee-
dles that are such a dark green it appears
almost black. You see a species of oak, and
another of ash, and birch as well. The forest you
see is alive with the sounds of bird calls, the cry
of deer, and the cough of something that can
only resemble a leopard. You can literally feel
the life surging, ebbing, dancing, and twirling
through the trees and around you; with just a
little effort, you can see the nature spirits —
called High Ones on this world — who are the
embodiment of the life force and reside in every
tree, shrub, and unhewn rock.
“You look up and catch your breath. It must be
daytime, for there is more than enough light, and
yet the sky is a deep blue, of the shade called
royal, and you can see a handful of stars shining
in the day’s sky. You locate the Sun; it is a dim
orange ball that produces a richer — and
dimmer — light than you are used to. You see
that this world has not one, but five moons of
different sizes and colors — scarlet, bluish
green, greenish blue, honey and cream, and a
rich vibrant violet — and they are scattered
along the sky like the marbles cast by a care-
less, giant child. And you see, east to west in the
southern quadrant of the sky, a shimmering
translucent arch that glows golden against the
dark blue of the sky. When you see that arch, a
name springs into your mind. That name is The
Bridge of the Gods, and you know that it is
directly above the equator and encircles the
entire world.”

We want you to realize that you are free — not only free, but encouraged —
to make any changes to the nature of your game world to match the vision
you have of your campaign. This not only enhances the uniqueness of your
campaign, but it encourages your players to become emotionally invested in
your campaign; and as your players become more emotionally invested, they
are also more susceptible to your attempts to convey the desired mood. Why
is that?
If gaming is meant to be a feast of the imagination, and the game world is
identical to the real world, it’s more difficult to fully engage the full strength
of our imaginations. This doesn’t mean that you need to run your campaigns
in the Bizarro universe of DC Comics. Very small changes can have a pro-
found effect, but only if the players are able to incorporate the alteration into
how they imagine your game world to be.
One very powerful way to do this is to start your campaign by taking your
gaming group through a guided visualization to describe your game world.
The sidebar, “Avonlea visualization,” gives you the text that Bjoern used
when he did this at the start of the Avonlea campaign. This demonstrates
only one of several different ways you can start feeding your players’ imagi-
nations with how different your game world really is.
Filling in character backgrounds
In the days of our misspent youth (translation: the pre-GURPS years of role
playing games), pretty much every campaign started out with the PCs just
arriving in the adventure locale as total strangers — not even knowing each
other. We always played our PCs in a vacuum; we rarely shared a background
with another PC and had no personal history with any of the NPCs we
encountered. Even when we played in campaigns based in our characters’
theoretical homelands, we never met the kinsfolk, friends, or associates who
knew our characters before the campaign began.
GURPS changed a lot of this; players have always had the option of taking
socially based advantages and disadvantages that demand the PCs be
located in areas where they are known to the locals, have a reputation, jobs,
and probably family. But still, in our experience, most GURPS GMs limit the
NPCs from our characters’ pasts to those individuals who have been speci-
fied as Patrons, Allies, Dependents, Contacts, or Enemies. Usually, most other
relatives are kept strictly in the shadows. We urge you to change that.
One thing that we’ve discovered gets players very invested in their charac-
ters and in the game world is requiring them to write a biography for their
characters. With these bios in hand, you can interweave the characters’
352
Part V: Building Your Own World 

backgrounds into your campaign scenario. Players get a whole different per-
spective on an adventure when (for example) one of the members of the
street gang they’re squaring off against is a childhood friend. Or if the victims
of the hideous attacks staged by the Mastermind’s minions happen to belong
to the family of a business rival of a PC’s parents. It requires more work, but it
really is worth it.
For example (returning to Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign once again), at the begin-
ning of the campaign, three of the players had decided to play women who
were members of the Kindred (the ruling caste). On further discussion, they
decided that the three women would be half-sisters — each sharing a common
father and a different mother. (In Avonlea society, it was a common practice for
a man to have a single legal wife and multiple concubines — the children of 
the concubines were of lesser status than the wife’s children, but were still
legitimate.) Because of this decision, the GM and involved players sat down
and created the sisters’ families: father, mothers, sisters, brothers, cousins,
aunts, uncles, and grandparents — to four generations out. Because everyone
involved were members of the ruling caste, and all marriages had to be made
outside of one’s own clan, this family tree ended up linking the sisters by blood
or marriage to nearly half the Land Rulers in the country. Granted, they were
pretty insignificant, “shirttail” relatives, but they still could claim kinship with
the sovereign ruler of nearly every place they visited — which created more
plotseeds, adventure leads, political shenanigans, and trouble for the party
than they had ever imagined. Yes, the party did end up attending a family
reunion, where they got ample demonstrations that the three sisters’ families
were just as dysfunctional as any real family.
It also gave the entire party an emotional anchor in the well-being of the sis-
ters’ family members (many of whom they got to know over time as they
repeatedly mooched off of the family’s hospitality). Not only did the charac-
ters get upset if some of Sariel’s minions attacked the estate of one of the sis-
ters’ siblings or cousins, but the players themselves took those attacks as
personal insults. These people would get truly and deeply upset when, as hap-
pened in one circumstance, they received a report that one of the sisters’
cousins had been murdered by one of their enemies. And when they heard
that the domain ruled by the sisters’ grandmother was about to be taken over
by an imposter, they dropped everything in order to race to save — not their
grandmother, who was dying anyway, but something even more important —
the prestige and property claimed by their clan.
Frankly, this is a rather extreme situation; not all campaigns benefit by having
nearly half of the characters in the party be closely related to each other. But
nearly every campaign can be significantly strengthened and made more
interesting if the GM integrates the characters’ backgrounds — and the
people from a characters’ past — into the campaign.

Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign

Adding details: Hemlines, haberdashery,
and upholstery
As far as we are aware, the only gaming milieu that regularly pays attention to
issues like style and fashion in the game world is cyberpunk, in which most
characters are not only typically cybernetically enhanced killers, but much 
of their reputation can depend upon how stylish they are — both in their
enhancements and in their combat techniques. This is a shame, and we urge
all GURPS GMs — regardless of campaign style or milieu — to spend the time
and energy to incorporate details about clothing styles, interior design, fash-
ion, and general artistic trends for their game worlds.
Using style, fashion, and design adds a level of richness and detail to a game
world (which is exactly what we’ve been harping about all through Part V),
and some other considerations for doing so are dependent upon milieu and
style of campaign. In the following list, we mention the ones that we consider
most important:
 Historical authenticity: If your campaign is set on the streets of Imperial
Rome, your players need to visualize what their characters are wearing.
What exactly is a toga, and who wore them? What about those funky skirts
all the Roman soldiers wear in the movies? What did women wear? You
need to be able to answer these questions and — unless you are empha-
sizing that your campaign is in an alternate Rome — you probably ought
to be as historically accurate as possible. You’ll be best served if you pro-
vide this information as part of the initial background information.
 Social conformity: With its absence of sumptuary laws, our modern cul-
ture is actually a historical anomaly because most human cultures
throughout history have had such laws in place. A sumptuary law legis-
lates the modes and styles of dress that the society considers accept-
able for people of different social classes. Specifically, sumptuary laws
existed to prohibit people from the lower social classes from wearing
the styles, articles of clothing, or colors that a particular society
reserved as a prerogative of a higher social position. For example, in the
ancient Celtic lands, a person’s social status determined the number of
colors that could be used to trim his cloaks. The higher the status, the
more colors were permitted; only the very highest-ranking people were
permitted to have their cloaks trimmed with five colors.
If your game world is rigidly stratified, then sumptuary laws most likely
exist, and if someone in the party wants to impersonate someone of a
higher social status, they will be breaking the law simply by putting on
the clothes they’d need to play the role. This is much more effective in
terms of play if the players know what styles of clothes each social class
is permitted and expected to wear.
354
Part V: Building Your Own World 

 Subtle messages and codes: Traditional Japan is an excellent example of
a culture that is so elegantly complex in its simplicity that an individual
can communicate a significant amount of information by how she wears
her clothes. For example, in some game worlds the way the belt of a
robe is tied may convey specific messages — anything from “I will love
you forever” to “I have taken out a contract to have you murdered.” Any
game world that has a society that is even remotely similar to traditional
Japan ought to incorporate such a degree of subtlety; and not by the GM
simply saying, “the way she tied her kimono means that you really ought
to check your ammunition levels.” The GM can develop a code and give
the players a translation key and then describe what a character is wear-
ing so that the players have to figure it out using the key — likewise the
players should be required to describe what the PCs are wearing when
they’re sending messages through this medium as well.
355
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Inspiring players: Veils
In recent chapters we recommend that you
establish during the world-creation phase at
least one culturally significant accessory or arti-
cle of clothing that can be used as a touchstone
for the characters in your campaign. In Chapter
20, we talk about the skeiyn dbuh, or “honor
knife,” in Bjoern’s Avonlea campaign. Another
example from Avonlea is the veil.
As he was creating the world of Uerth for the
Avonlea campaign, Bjoern decided that women
in his world were much more likely than men to
be mages and telepaths, and Telepathy was the
more common ability of the two. This would
cause women of Power to be both revered and
feared by the general populace because 
they wielded powers that could strip bare the
innermost secrets of a person’s mind, and eye
contact was believed to be the most common
mechanism for connecting with another
person’s mind. So, within Avonlea society, it
became customary for women of Power or high
Status (which meant to be a member of the
Kindred caste) to go veiled in public — not due
to a demand for modesty, but to insulate the
woman from the fears and anxieties that could
overwhelm a telepathic sensitive, and to lessen
the fears of the common people by protecting
them from eye contact with these powerful
women.
In the actual Avonlea campaign, the players
created four characters who should — by the
customs of the culture — wear veils, even
though one of the characters was a fencer who
started the campaign with very little in the way
of paranormal ability, and another was primarily
a warrior even though she was also a telepath.
This led to some interesting discussions
between the players about how their charac-
ters would wear — and keep from disarray —
their veils while in combat, and there was a
constant tension because one of these charac-
ters had a quirk that she would go out without
her veil — much to the consternation of her
older sisters!
We provide this example to show how using an
idea as simple as “women of power or high
social status will always go veiled in public” can
be a vehicle for role playing and for inspiring the
players’ interest and imagination.

 Affiliations and allegiances: Woven cloth was incredibly valuable to
pre-technological societies, and weavers jealously guarded the many
secrets of its making. In some cultures, each family knew a specific
weave pattern that they taught only to their younger family members;
in these cultures, a person’s family could be identified simply by the
weave of the clothing they were wearing. The best-known example of
this is the clan tartans of Scotland, but other cultures have similar —
and much more subtle — customs. Heraldry also falls into this
category; if your game world uses heraldic devices such as coats of
arms, we consider it worthwhile to spend the time to come up with a
description of the devices that are most germane to the campaign.
 Clues in a mystery: In classic mystery literature, sleuths frequently
detect inconsistencies in the way the clothing is worn. Of course, one
of the greatest difficulties that we’ve seen in GMing a mystery campaign
is how the GM can convey the information about the vital clues
without giving away that they are clues simply by mentioning them.
You can handle this by creating a game world that has specific customs
or rules about how clothing is properly worn (such as in traditional
Japan). This information would then be emphasized through the world
description, character creation, and early sessions in the campaign —
the goal here isn’t to give the players each and every specific datum
about the culture’s fashions, it is to give them enough information that
they know which questions to ask. Then you can let the players know
that the only information they’ll get is information that they actually
ask about.
Like with every other aspect of your game world, you are free to make your
own decisions about the fashions of your world. If you want to try for true
authenticity in your campaign, then you need to do a fair bit of research. But
don’t be afraid to be only partly authentic. Feel free to make stuff up. Do you
want to have your Roman legions wear beanie caps? You are certainly free to
do so. Put beanie caps on your legionnaires, and if any of your players claim
that it doesn’t make any sense, just remind them about how much sense
men’s neckties truly make.
We consider interior design to be just as important for the flavor of your
campaign as clothing styles. The more you can impart to the players a sense
of the nature of their surroundings, the more that they can imagine them-
selves in your world. This can cover architectural style and how buildings
are organized, as well as little things like upholstery styles — it all helps
build the shared reality for the imaginations of you and your players to
romp in.
356
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Creating Your Own Skills, Advantages,
and Disadvantages
One way to create a totally unique flavor for your campaign is to introduce an
advantage, disadvantage, or skill that is totally unique to your game world.
This is a lot of work and has a high potential of unbalancing the campaign, so
it is not something that we recommend that you do lightly. GURPS Basic Set:
Characters gives you some very good guidelines on how to modify or create
new advantages (pages 117–118) and disadvantages (pages 165–166). We sug-
gest that you start there if you want to do this.
Sometimes all you need to do is add a special effect to an existing ability
(advantage, disadvantage, or skill) that has very little impact on game
mechanics. For example, Bjoern wanted the mages in his Avonlea campaign
357
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Tips that make your players 
care about their characters
Whether or not the players of any particular
campaign are able to become emotionally
invested in their GURPS characters is in large
part dependent upon how much the GM allows
them to become so. Emotions rarely happen in a
vacuum, and most people need emotional
anchors before they engage their feelings on
behalf of an imaginary person. The GM provides
the framework that allows the players to find
these anchors, and then it is up to the GM to
permit some playing time for establishing and
maintaining those anchors. The following list
provides you with five tips that give players
emotional anchors to their characters. None of
these tips needs to be taken as either an advan-
tage or a disadvantage, and theoretically they
won’t create complications to your plotline, but
they can have a big effect on your players’
experience and enjoyment of your campaign.
 Define their ambitions: When it comes time
for the players to write a character back-
ground, ask them to include a description of
that character’s motivations, ambitions, and
personal goals. If these give you an idea for
an adventure that you can reasonably
include in the campaign, write in opportuni-
ties for the characters to explore — and
maybe even achieve — these objectives.
 Build a home: If it is appropriate during
character creation, have the players create
a floor plan of the place where their char-
acters live, subject to your approval, of
course. If, during the course of an adven-
ture, they take over some place that would
be an appropriate headquarters/home for
the party, let them have the floor plans from
the adventure and insist that they spend
some time with any redecorating or remod-
eling (and make them pay for it, of course).
If they decide to acquire a building that
wasn’t part of an adventure, you can make
them create the floor plan themselves.
Again, this is subject to your final approval
and modifications.
(continued)

to throw off eerie lights when they were casting a spell. Borrowing a page
from the Witch World series by Andre Norton (and the third-edition world
book, GURPS Witch World), he determined that the different colleges of magic
would be grouped into different categories of color magic. For instance, Red
Magic included all the spells of the colleges of Body Control, Fire, and
Healing. Whenever a character cast any one of these spells, he would glow
red, and when the spell was released, the glow would transfer to the subject
of the spell before it faded. This created an effect that felt completely unique,
made enemy mages much scarier (especially if they started glowing purple,
which was the color of Mind Control and Necromancy), and helped shape the
identities of the PC mages.

 Bring in the family: During the process of
character creation, sit down with each
player and come up with a list and descrip-
tion of each character’s family, including
both living and dead relatives. If the char-
acter is an orphan, make the player write a
description of what the character knows of
her childhood, how she became an orphan,
and who ended up raising her. Choose a
few of the people on the family lists to use
as walk-on NPCs and have them show up
occasionally, not as no-point Dependents
(although you can do that, too), but simply
as family members maintaining relation-
ships. This is most interesting and enter-
taining if you make sure that these families
are dysfunctional; use the character’s
mental disadvantages and quirks as your
guide to what those dysfunctions might be.
 Define friendships and romantic relation-
ships: Do the same thing with voluntary rela-
tionships as you did with family of origin. If
the player wants her character to be in a
committed relationship but has not taken the
spouse as an Ally or Dependent, have her
explain the nature of the relationship and
why the spouse either is unable to assist the
character or is completely safe from danger.
Remember that Allies can cost as little as 1
character point, and Dependents can be
worth as little as –1 character point. A –1-
point Dependent is essentially a quirk and
could be a girlfriend who periodically calls
the PC on his cell phone — usually at an
inconvenient time.
 Give them hobbies: Everyone has a hobby
(yours is probably role playing games), and
so should most PCs. During character cre-
ation, you can have each player come up
with one hobby that his character is inter-
ested in, even if it doesn’t require a skill to
practice. Then you can give them opportu-
nities to indulge in their characters’ hobbies
during the course of play. For example, say
a player determines her character collects
perfume bottles as a hobby. That’s fine; 
you can simply throw this in almost any 
time you want. If the party is stalking their
enemy through a shopping mall, you could
have that PC notice that they pass a small
boutique with an interesting collection of
perfume bottles in the window. Does the
character stop stalking the enemy to go
shopping? Or does the character decide to
return to the store at a later date?
(continued)

Of course, you may envision some ability in your game world that simply
cannot be handled appropriately by the established rules, in which case you
have to create the ability from scratch. Be very careful when you do this. We
see a lot of GMs (ourselves included) who have been overly generous with
the ratio between what the ability can do and how many character points it
costs. This is a natural tendency, but one you must control. In essence it
tends to reward the players who take your pet ability and penalize those who
do not. We recommend that you look very closely at anything in the estab-
lished rules that is even remotely similar and try to balance your new ability
to be equivalent to what you’re comparing it against.
In the nearby sidebars, we include two examples from Bjoern’s Avonlea cam-
paign: a new power (Land Rule), and a new disadvantage (Servant of the
Light) to illustrate how some GMs handle creating new abilities for their cam-
paigns. In the case of the Servant of the Light (SOL) disadvantage, Bjoern
envisioned a campaign with two diametrically opposed ethical alignments:
the Powers of Light and the Powers of Darkness. In this world, most people
tended to stay ethically neutral; being neutral was called being “in the
shadow,” and an individual who was sworn to adhere to either one of these
alignments faced some very real limitations, not only in what she could and
could not do, but also because, in Avonlea, a devout commitment to an ethi-
cal position was readily apparent in a person’s aura to anyone who could
read auras (which included a sizeable percentage of the population). This
could occasionally be an advantage — not only did being a Servant of the
359
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Sample disadvantage: Servant 
of the Light, –15 points
You have made a conscious choice to ally your-
self with the Powers of the Light in your world
and have actively opposed the actions of the
Powers of the Darkness whenever you’ve
encountered them. You adhere to the Light’s
Code of Honor to 
 Never attempt to control or deceive another
entity to cause them harm
 Always honor your oaths
 Never throw a curse
 Never steal
 Never attack an innocent or unarmed
person
 Never use poison covertly
 Never attempt to cause harm to another
without first declaring yourself and giving
them a viable opportunity to respond
Your adherence to the ethos of the Light is
apparent in your aura and is easily recognizable
to anyone who can perceive the Hidden
Realms. You are automatically the foe of anyone
who is a Servant of the Darkness, but you can
call upon other Servants of the Light for aid
whenever they are encountered. You may enter
the Temples and Fanes of the Powers of the
Light without fear of harm.

Light attract the attention of the bad guys, but it also opened certain doors
that would not otherwise open and gave the Servant of the Light characters
access to certain powers that were otherwise unavailable. Thus, the ability
combined aspects of existing disadvantages (Vow, Enemy, Code of Honor),
advantages (Patron, Contacts), and some special effects (the changed aura).
In the case of the Land Rule power, Bjoern envisioned a society that was cultur-
ally unified but had a barrier to the political unification of the different clans
and domains. Duels of honor were common, and political dominance was
based on possessing a paranormal ability that tied the rulers to the land and
demanded that these rulers defend the land at all costs. He used The Riddle of
the Stars trilogy by Patricia McKillip for inspiration, modified it heavily with the
Celtic concepts of Sacred Kingship, and came up with the Land Rule Power.
One of your players might present you with an ability that she has created and
wants to give to her PC. Be wary! Even if she has done this with the best of
intentions, your player most likely has some uses for this ability that she has
not informed you of, and if you allow her character to have the ability she cre-
ated, she will probably spring her hidden use on you during play. At the very
least, players are notoriously generous in deciding the point value of an ability
they have created. How can you handle this? First off, do not simply accept
the ability as it is presented to you. Take the description, tell your player that
you’ll consider it, and run some test scenarios with it. See if you can identify
the loophole that the player built into it, and if you find it unacceptable, see
what you can do to close that loophole. Even if you decide that the ability is
360
Part V: Building Your Own World 
Sample advantage: Land Rule
Characters with this ability are mystically
attuned to the natural world. They possess a
heightened awareness of their surroundings
that rivals the perceptions of even the most sen-
sitive psychic. There are three levels to this abil-
ity, each level signifying a different degree of
attunement to the land. In Avonlea, an individ-
ual must possess one of the three levels of Land
Rule to qualify as a member of the caste of the
Kindred.
 Land Sense (10 points): Characters with
Land Sense possess a subliminal aware-
ness of their environment. All characters
with Land Sense can identify a sense of
rightness or wrongness about the land, but
little else. Areas tainted by pollution, super-
natural evil, or disease will feel somehow
wrong to their senses. In practical terms,
this ability amounts to a Talent encompass-
ing all Outdoor skills (Survival, Tracking,
Fishing, Navigation, Climbing, Naturalist,
and Seamanship).
 Land Empathy (25 points): Land Empathy is a
more profound attunement to the land than
Land Sense. Characters with Land Empathy
receive much more detail in their subliminal
perceptions. Characters with Land Empathy
have all the advantages of Land Sense, 
and in addition, this power counts as a 
Talent granting a +1 to all Animal skills,

361
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Agronomy, Area Knowledge (for the area they
are in), Gardening, Geology, Meteorology,
Prospecting, Surveying, Camouflage (out-
doors only), Scrounging (outdoors only),
Shadowing (outdoors only), Stealth (outdoors
only), and Traps (outdoors only).
Characters with Land Empathy are physi-
cally affected by the state of their environ-
ment. If the land is blighted, diseased, or
under a killing drought, the character must
roll against HT every day. A failure of this
roll means that the character is –1 to one of
his attributes (HT, ST, IQ, and DX), which-
ever is most appropriate to reflect the prob-
lem with the land.
 Full Land Rule (40 points): Initially, the dis-
tinction between Land Rule and Land
Empathy is very subtle, and one is easily
mistaken for the other. The full powers of
the Land Rule Power manifest only when
the character has successfully passed a
ritual called the Ordeal. Passing the Ordeal
requires the Full Land Rule Power; failure is
lethal.
Before the Ordeal, Land Rule gives all of the
abilities of Land Empathy along with the
equivalent of a +1 Talent for the skills of
Tactics, Strategy, and the ability to divine
sources of water or minerals with a roll of IQ
– 3. These characters are subconsciously
aware of events in their environment and
frequently have dreams that inform their
conscious minds of significant events in their
vicinity. They may (on a roll against IQ – 5)
perceive the Nature Spirits in their immedi-
ate environment, but this perception is neb-
ulous and usually limited to a sense of the
Spirits’ emotions.
A character who survives the Ordeal expe-
riences a profound change in perceptions.
At this point, this power truly reflects the
adage that “the King and the Land are One.”
In many ways, characters with Land Rule
become the conscious extensions of the
land. This awareness can be described as
“a third eye, ear, and hand.” They are able
to fully perceive and communicate with the
Nature Spirits, and the Spirits become the
source for the development of one focus of
the five “Land Powers” (Earth, Air, Water,
Animal, Plant). An individual is able to
undergo the Ordeal multiple times; each
time he survives, the character is able to
claim another focus of Land Power. When a
character has passed the Ordeal, he may
spend available character points (now or at
any point in the future) to gain or improve
his Land Powers.
Furthermore, passing the Ordeal gains the
character the right to claim Sovereignty
Powers over a specific territory, which he
then claims as his domain. A character with
Sovereignty Powers binds the Nature Spirits
of an area to his will and takes them as an Ally
Group. The Full Land Rule Power has a built-
in compulsion to claim and rule territory, and
only one person may claim Sovereignty
Powers over a particular area. Land Rulers
become very territorial about their domains
and react with instinctive hostility if another
Land Ruler so much as enters their territories.
Treat this as Intolerance toward all other Land
Rulers.
The connection between the condition of
the Land and the Land Ruler’s health is more
pronounced than with Land Empathy. Land
Rulers suffer the same ill effects of being in
an area under blight; however, after a Land
Ruler has claimed sovereignty over an area,
the state of the Land Ruler’s health affects
the conditions of the land. If the Land Ruler
becomes ill, so does the land, to the degree
of severity proportionate to the ruler’s ill-
ness. In this case, age counts as an illness:
As a Land Ruler ages, the Land loses vital-
ity and fertility and will continue to do so
until the Land Ruler dies and the bonds of
sovereignty are released.

totally hunky-dory as written, we recommend that you make some modifica-
tions to it before giving it the green light. If there is anything about the ability
that you dislike and cannot correct, do not allow it in your campaign. You are
the GM, and although you want your players to like you, you have to protect
your campaign from something that could rise up and bite you during play.
Creating Your Own Character Templates
The fourth edition of GURPS introduced character templates as a core com-
ponent of the official rules, and we think it is a darn good addition that makes
playing — and GMing — much easier. To be honest, at first glance, we weren’t
too sure; we were afraid that Steve Jackson Games was shifting to creating
“classes” in GURPS; something that we would heartily oppose.
But such was not the case. As the GURPS Basic Set repeatedly emphasizes,
templates are not rules, and players are not expected to be confined to creat-
ing characters within the parameters of established templates. However, tem-
plates are an excellent way of giving your players examples of characters that
are appropriate in a particular campaign, and what level of character ability
they’re expected to create. You can find an excellent description of what you
need to consider when creating character templates for your campaign on
pages 445 to 449 in GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns; please read it thoroughly
and carefully; you’ll be glad you did.
Character templates can help your players create characters that fit within
the parameters of your campaign. Frankly, some players will ignore your
world description and character-creation guidelines and try to get you to
approve characters that are not suitable for your campaign. Templates are a
fairly concrete means of communicating the information about your cam-
paign in ways that make your players pay attention.
For an example of a character template, we return to Bjoern’s Avonlea cam-
paign. Bjoern found that when his players were creating characters for his
campaign, they had difficulty comprehending the complexity of the system of
interlocking relationships based on kinship, oaths, obligations, and duty. In
such a society, the higher an individual’s status, the more they were bound
by their feudal and familial obligations, but also the more freedom they had
to move through the countryside, and the more access they had to the
courts of the elite and the powerful. Some players had difficulty understand-
ing the value and necessity of taking high Status and the need to take the
additional abilities that were integral to that Status in this society. By giving
them templates — like the one in the sidebar, “Sample character template” —
Bjoern was able to illustrate the differences in the traits of characters from
the three castes. This, more than anything else, best demonstrated to the
players what qualities the society of Avonlea demanded of its members.
362
Part V: Building Your Own World 

One thing that Steve Jackson Games repeatedly emphasizes about character
templates is that, unlike racial templates, the disadvantages listed do count
against the disadvantage limit imposed by the GM. There are some excep-
tions; for example, if the GM requires all PCs to take a particular disadvan-
tage, then it is not part of the disadvantage limit.
In the third edition of GURPS, the standard campaign was based on 100-point
characters with a limit of –40 points in disadvantages. GURPS fourth edition
has changed all that. Not only is a standard character built more along the
lines of 150 to 200 points, but Steve Jackson Games has made disadvantage
limits up to the discretion of the GM. We do recommend that you establish
some limit on disadvantages; at the most, it should be half the campaign’s
point value, so a good limit for a 200-point campaign is –100 points in disad-
vantages.
363
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign
Sample character template
Note: This character template is suitable for a
200-point campaign with a –100-point limit in dis-
advantages. Please note that, even though the
template is for a 150-point character, the tem-
plate includes only –50 points in disadvantages.
If a player took the last –50 points in disadvan-
tages and –5 points in quirks, this character
would have 105 points available for a player to
personalize the character. The numbers in brack-
ets are each item’s cost in character points.

Despite the official rules, we use two other situations when a disadvantage
does not count against the personal limit: 
 If a disadvantage represents a quality that the GM wants to encourage
but not require the characters to have. For example, Bjoern established
that the Servant of the Light disadvantage, which appears in the “Sample
disadvantage” sidebar, would not count against the personal disadvan-
tage limit. From a campaign design standpoint, his rationale was that he
wanted to encourage — but not require — a party that could be counted
on to oppose the depredations of the Powers of the Darkness. From a
game world perspective, the rationale was that the additional points this
disadvantage made available were earned by the character’s greater
level of life experience gained by actively opposing the Powers of the
Darkness in the past.
 Allowing human characters to take disadvantages above the personal
disadvantage limit if the character belongs to an Order or Secret
Society. These organizations provide intensive training in a highly spe-
cialized set of skills. Examples of an Order are an Assassins Guild, a
Mages Guild, a martial arts school, or a monastic religious organization.
The rationale for this is that a character receiving the intense training
has also accepted the onus of furthering the objectives of the organiza-
tion. This could manifest as additional Duties, ethical strictures, restric-
tions on behavior, or extra Enemies or Dependents beyond those that a
“lay” character could be expected to assume. An example of such an
Order from Avonlea — an order of Priestess-Healers called “the Wardens
of the Eternal Flame” — appears in the sidebar, “Sample Order template.”
If using Orders is appropriate to your game world, you need to keep game
balance in mind constantly. The extra disadvantages must both be reason-
able for the organization and must lay a heavy burden upon the character,
with severe penalties for not meeting those obligations. Using the example 
of the Wardens of the Eternal Flame (or simply “the Wardens”), the members
of this Order are required to take these disadvantages: Pacifism — Cannot
Harm Innocents, Disciplines of the Faith, and a Vow (“Provide comfort and
healing to any and all beings who request it”). Even though a Warden has sig-
nificant benefits over other characters with the –35 points of extra disadvan-
tages at her disposal, the obligation to heal anyone on request — even a
mortal enemy — neutralizes many of her personal and strategic advantages.
Should a Warden fail to live up to these standards, she would quickly find
that the Power Investment granted to her by the Eternal Flame that she wor-
ships will cease to be effective, and she will find that both her Reputation and
her Patron advantages will work to her detriment unless she makes amends
for her failings.
364
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Membership in an Order isn’t a blank check to take a bunch of extra goodies
with those extra points from disadvantages. When creating a template for an
Order, we recommend that you require the character take at least as many
points in specific advantages or skills as you allow in “extra” disadvantages.
These represent the specific knowledge and abilities that each member of the
Order is expected to possess.
Unlike character templates, the template of an Order is not optional for a
character who belongs to that Order; it represents the minimum standards
required for a character who is considered competent enough to be permit-
ted to go out into the world — whether on a mission for the Order or on the
character’s own recognizance. It is possible that some Orders provide a
series of choices between abilities of the same point value, but specific stan-
dards for specific abilities need to be set.
Orders can be of great value to your campaign. They establish organizations
that characters can belong to and that give them a support network that can
work in furtherance of your plotline. They also guarantee that the PC’s moti-
vations and objectives are more predictable. In our experience, using Orders
and mandating their activities does not make the players feel like you are
depriving them of their free will; not if the players freely chose to play a
member of the Order.

Creating Your Own Races
You can have a fully engrossing and involving fantasy campaign using only the
stereotypical Tolkien races in your game world — elves, dwarves, halflings, and
orcs . . . oh, and humans, too. But that doesn’t help you much if you’re not run-
ning a fantasy campaign. Even if your campaign is considered to be fantasy —
regardless of how much you work to make it your own world — it is going to be
considered somewhat derivative.
Creating new races for your game world can create a unique feeling for your
campaign. Pages 450 to 454 of GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns gives you excel-
lent guidelines for the process of creating new races for your campaign.
Check it out.
Creating nonhuman races can be a lot of fun. Unless the race is very closely
related to humans, don’t take any quality as a given; you get to start out with
a totally blank slate. Even if a race looks very human — or almost human —
doesn’t mean that it is human. Especially within a high-tech space campaign,
an alien race could have evolved with a nearly identical physical appearance
but be substantially and profoundly different in terms of abilities, attitudes,
and motivations. (One motif that science fiction writers have explored over
the years is the dichotomy between a race that appears human but is inhu-
manly evil compared to races that are obviously not human but share human-
ity’s ethical and spiritual qualities.) Races that are essentially human in all
but appearance are — quite frankly — pretty boring; if these races are noth-
ing but window dressing for your campaign, we suggest that you don’t
bother. They really won’t add anything to your campaign and could alienate
(pun intended) some players if they figure it out. A nonhuman race needs to
be different in ability, attitude, and appearance.
When you start building a new race, you need to consider how this race fits
into your milieu. Are they going to be a race whose members live parallel —
and more-or-less in harmony — to humanity, or are they going to be a built-in
adversary? Does your race possess innate abilities that are as mundane as
the average human, or does every member of that race possess powers
beyond the comprehension of most humans? What hopes, dreams, and ideals
does your race have in common with humanity? What is different about
them? These are much more important questions than what a race looks like,
and how you answer them determines how well one of your nonhuman races
goes over in your campaign.
In Chapter 20, we introduced you to Daisy, an NPC Ally of the party in Bjoern’s
Avonlea campaign. Daisy was a member of a race called the Lizard Folk. This
pacifistic race had tied their fortunes to the much more warlike Dalesmen by
placing themselves under the protection of the Kindred in exchange for some
366
Part V: Building Your Own World 

of their members serving the Kindred as nearly incorruptible domestic
servants and spies. The Lizard Folk had a much more important presence
than merely being scaly telepathic domestics with tails; they had their own
beliefs, imperatives, and prejudices, and their presence in the campaign
extended beyond Daisy’s service to the PC Ysabet. They were always in the
background, ubiquitously serving and watching and remembering everything
that went on around them. Although no one could ever consider the Lizard
Folk to be a threat, they served the Kindred, protected the domains of
Avonlea in other ways, and created a unique presence in the world.
Ad-libbing
Many years ago, we were players in a campaign in which our party had to
stage a raid on the hidden laboratory of a mad scientist located amongst the
ruins of an ancient city on a deserted island. While we were planning our
strategy, the GM gave us a map of the island. We instantly noticed that there
was a direct-line “front door” route through the ruins (which we knew were
loaded with all sorts of nasty booby traps and minions), but we also noticed

and have reptilian faces and jewel-like eyes.
They do not wear clothing. The Lizard Folk are

in the households of their local protectors.

that, if we were to sail around the island, we had access to a back door into
the laboratory that avoided the vast majority of the ruins. We liked the idea
and informed the GM of this plan.
The GM flat out declared that we couldn’t do this. Why not? We had a boat
(and — just as importantly — someone with the skill to pilot it), we had a
route, and while we were under a deadline to accomplish our mission, we had
ample time to make it around the island to reach the back door. That didn’t
matter; the GM still flatly refused to let us take this course. The conversation
got heated and tempers flared; the players demanded to know why we
couldn’t even attempt to do what we wanted. Finally, obviously frustrated and
near tears, the GM blurted out “Because I don’t have an adventure set up for
you to go that way!”
Oops.
It may sound cold-hearted and callous, but it’s just human nature: The GM
lost her players that night. After that moment, we were unwilling to overlook
the little bumps and foibles that are present in every campaign. We were
unwilling to give her the benefit of the doubt, and she had lost our loyalty
and our commitment to stay within the plotline she established. The cam-
paign died from lack of player interest soon thereafter.
The GM committed several grievous errors that evening because she forgot
the three most important rules of GMing:
 Always assume your players are going to do something to mess up your
plans.
 Always keep your plotline moving forward while giving the players the
illusion that they are acting of their own free will.
 When in doubt, ad-lib.
The GM could have taken several different strategies in this situation, any
one of which would have been better that her outright refusal to let us follow
our desired route:
 She could have thrown some wandering monsters and other delaying
actions at the party while we were sailing around the island long enough
to keep us from reaching the back door until the next gaming session —
that would have given her a week to prepare for the change in plans.
 She could have allowed us to follow our course until, at some point, she
introduced an insurmountable barrier inside the game world that would
have forced us to return to the plan of attack she had prepared for.
 She could have quickly shuffled some parts of her adventure around so
that we faced some of the exact same threats that we had tried to avoid
with our attempt at a back-door attack.
368
Part V: Building Your Own World 

Notice that we did not say that she should have been prepared for us to go
the alternative route. No GM can possibly anticipate or prepare for all the dif-
ferent ways the innate perversity of players (all players, ourselves included)
can twist a campaign out of its planned course. It is not only an unwise
investment in your time (after all, in the long run, the party can only take a
single course of action in any given scenario), but it should be unnecessary,
provided that you’re willing to ad-lib in these situations.
We’ve found that when we’ve had to ad-lib, we’ve come up with some truly bril-
liant ideas. Some of the features of our campaigns that have most impressed
themselves on the minds of the players happened because we were forced to
run an adventure off-the-cuff. This is one of the great advantages of creating
your adversaries (at least the minion NPCs) as templates rather than as unique
individuals tailor-made for each situation. If you have the templates available,
you can throw something together at the last minute, which keeps the game
going, lets the players believe they have their characters’ destinies under con-
trol, and can keep the plotline from getting too far off the mark.
Goofing Up
No GM is infallible; we can pretty much guarantee that sometime during your
career as a GM you will goof up. There will come a time when you make an
error in your campaign that you can’t ad-lib your way out of, can’t explain
away, and can’t allow to simply continue. This could be one of several differ-
ent things, from throwing an enemy at the party that is just too powerful, to
allowing the party to have a power or ability that is just too much for your
game world to handle, to introducing a plot element that doesn’t work the
way that you had hoped, to simply making a ruling that you come to regret.
When you goof up, you need to fess up. Admit your mistake to your players,
correct the problem in the game world, simply by saying, “I made a mistake,
here is how things are going to be,” and then get on with the adventure.
If you try to hide your mistake from the players — whether from a misguided
expectation that you should appear to be omniscient in your campaign or
from a fear of losing the players’ respect — then you most likely will lose
some or all of the respect of some or all of your players. No one likes being
lied to or deceived, and if your attempt to bury your mistakes becomes
apparent, you will alienate people.
You will be called upon — probably many times during the course of a 
campaign — to make rulings and to interpret the official rules in situations
that don’t allow you to spend a whole lot of time ruminating about every
potential factor or variable. The way we started handling it years ago was by
369
Chapter 21: Flavoring Your Campaign

establishing a policy that any time we make a ruling in a campaign, our ruling
is in effect only for that particular night of play. No ruling remains in effect for
more than a single night of play unless the GM confirms that ruling in writing.
This allows us to keep the adventure going when a question arises but does
not lock us into a decision until we have had the opportunity to consider it
and all of its variables without the pressure and tension of an actual gaming
session. We’ve found that our players accept our need to occasionally make
reversals of our rulings with a great deal more grace and good humor since
we’ve instituted this policy. We suggest that you consider using it as well.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You get to reap the benefit of our collective 30+ years
of playing GURPS in a different way than that of 
the rest of this book. Here, we get to share with you our
favorite selections in a number of different categories.
Because so much of a GURPS campaign depends on
having appropriate player characters, we focus most of
this part on character creation. One way to do this is to
maximize the value of the character points you spend at
character creation, so Chapter 22 gives you ten great ways
to do this. Some advantages give you more bang for your
buck than others, and Chapter 23 lists our ten favorites.
We’ve discovered that some disadvantages are more fun 
to play — and less limiting or restrictive to the characters
than others; Chapter 24 lists ten of the best disadvantages.
We’re constantly amazed at how some players don’t think
about some skills that they really ought to have. Chapter 25
lists ten skills every character ought to have. Finally, we’ve
discovered that having a well-rounded library really helps
when we’re GMing, so in Chapter 26, we share our picks for
the best books GMs should own.

Chapter 22
Ten Rules for Spending Points
A
ctually, there are no rules for spending points other than being accurate
in your math when checking your totals. This list of ten is more a set 
of guidelines that describe how we create our characters and approach the
problem of getting the best possible characters with the points available 
to us.
Have a Character Focus
When we talk about having a focus, we mean having some specific set of abili-
ties that defines what your character is all about. Often, this focus describes
the career of the character, such as a sharpshooter or a thief, but it also might
consist of an unusual ability that makes him special, such as telepathy or mar-
tial arts expertise. We find that having a focus for your character makes decid-
ing how to invest your points much easier. Having a focus also provides a
blueprint for developing your character during play. If you’re struggling to find
a focus for your character, consider starting with a character template.
Raise Attributes Rather Than Skills
Think of attributes as the foundation of your character and skills as the
specifics. Investing in attributes can benefit many aspects of your character
all at once. For example, an increase in DX raises both your Basic Speed and
any skill based on DX. Particularly keep in mind that if you find yourself
investing 2 or more points in a wide variety of skills based on the same
attribute, it may be more cost-effective to raise the base attribute instead.
This is especially true if you have lots of skills based on an inexpensive sec-
ondary characteristic such as Will or Perception.

Increase Your Basic Speed 
to a Whole Number
Basic Speed is one of the most critical numbers in combat, because it deter-
mines your Dodge, Basic Move, and when you get to take your turn. But
because your Basic Move is based on the integer value of Basic Speed, we
always recommend spending the points to bring Basic Speed to a whole
number to get the additional hex of movement. In other words, a Basic Speed
of 5.75 gives a Basic Move of 5, but raising that to the whole number of 6.0
gives your character a Basic Move of 6.
Consider Splitting Your Stats
By splitting your stats, we generally mean having a difference between the level
of a basic attribute and any of the secondary characteristics it determines.
Buying IQ without buying as many levels of Will or Perception is an example. IQ
costs 20 points per level, and Will and Perception are both 5 points per level.
Normally, when you purchase IQ, it includes Will and Perception. But you can
elect to raise the basic attribute of IQ without raising Will and Perception and
then pay only 10 points per level. This also reflects certain subtypes of charac-
ters (the smart person who is easily influenced or who doesn’t notice things
around him). The advantage is that skills based on IQ are still calculated using
the high value (but note that skills based directly on Perception use its level).
We’re in favor of doing this when you are looking for a few additional points to
invest in something that you really want and don’t want to reduce all aspects of
an attribute.
You can also raise a secondary characteristic above the basic attribute. For
example, you can lower ST and purchase HP to represent the not-so-strong
but tough character. A common variant is to raise your FP (3 points per level)
above your HT (10 points per level). We recommend this if you are a mage or
if you need a fatigue to power a specific ability. (Note that such adjustments
can count against limits on maximum disadvantages. See GURPS Basic Set:
Characters, page 11.)
Always Take All Your Quirks
Quirks are one of the things that we love most about GURPS. They give us a
chance to have fun with our characters in ways other systems don’t. And
with the standard five quirks allowed, it’s five points that we can spend on
advantages or skills.
374
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Usually Take Maximum Disadvantages
If your GM has put a maximum on disadvantages, trust that she is planning
on you taking that many points in disadvantages. Although a good disadvan-
tage does limit your character in some meaningful way, it also frequently
adds depth and interest to your character. And, as with quirks, disadvantages
give you points to spend on advantages and skills.
Defer Purchasing Advantages
Learnable advantages, such as Combat Reflexes, make as much if not more
sense to acquire during an adventure than beforehand because they reflect
the changes that person might experience as a result of adventuring. An
investment in attributes and skills is almost always worthwhile regardless of
the campaign. Waiting to see how the world actually works can be extremely
useful before deciding on advantages. Of course, before taking this advice,
make sure your GM will allow you to add the advantage you’re considering
after gaming has started.
Make Sure You Can Attack in Combat
One of the saddest sights in the gaming universe is watching a player realize
that his character is totally unprepared for battle. Having a form of attack
doesn’t mean that your character has to be focused as a fighter. Just make
sure that you have something useful to do during a battle other than serve as
a distraction for your enemies. At the very least, we recommend Knife, or if
technology permits, Gun (Pistol). Not only is this important for the success 
of your character, but combat is frequently a major portion of a gaming ses-
sion, so having one of these skills ensures that you as a player have some-
thing to do.
Make Sure You Can Defend Yourself
Another really sad sight is the look on the face of a player who discovers that
her mighty warrior can be knocked down with a feather. A defense in this
sense can be a skill — in fact, it can be a combat skill — but it can also be
armor or magical abilities. Just make sure that your character can withstand
being hit once or twice by a typical weapon in the campaign or that she has
some way of avoiding being hit at all.
375
Chapter 22: Ten Rules for Spending Points

Use Talents
On a practical level, Talents provide an efficient investment of points if you
have a group of skills that you will likely want to increase beyond a single
point. But our reason for liking Talents has more to do with the way in which
they provide a collection of skills that represent an interest or specialization.
When your character has a focus, you will often find that that focus is on a
related set of skills, the perfect situation for taking a Talent. You’ll also fre-
quently find that Talents provide a useful way of finding a collection of skills
for secondary interests of your character (for instance, being good with 
animals). Also consider advantages that directly improve your abilities in
related skills such as Absolute Direction, Charisma, Flexibility, High Manual
Dexterity, and Voice.
376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Chapter 23
Ten Advantages We Like
W
e’ve never met an advantage that we didn’t like, but these are the
ones that we think are the best investments. Of course, no single char-
acter is likely to have all of these advantages, but most of our characters
have one or two from this list. Several of these advantages are not available
in realistic campaigns, and two of them — Gadgeteer and Magery — would
likely define the focus of your character if you took them. The others supple-
ment any character concept that you may have. And, yes, there are actually
11 items rather than 10. We couldn’t find one to cut, and our GM . . . I mean
our editor . . . didn’t place a point limit on the chapter. We focused our
choices on advantages that are internal to the character, and thus didn’t
include some useful advantages relating to the character’s social network,
such as Status, Patrons, and Allies.
Combat Reflexes (15)
As the name suggests, the Combat Reflexes advantage is most suited to cam-
paigns that require a lot of combat. The improvement in your character’s
active defenses makes this a very worthwhile investment. We often end up
adding this advantage after gaming has started, but we always want it
whether we can afford it or not.
Damage Resistance (5 per level)
Damage Resistance is not permitted in most campaigns, but when it is avail-
able, it is definitely a good investment — unless you can buy armor from TL5
or above. In lower TLs, armor is generally heavy, restrictive, and not that
good. Having an innate DR is a tremendous advantage in those situations.

Extra Attack (25) or 
Weapon Master (25)
If an adventure involves a significant amount of combat, being able to strike
extra blows (Extra Attack) or more damage (Weapon Master) is worthwhile.
Either of these advantages tends to make your character more combat-
focused, but neither of them is so expensive that combat has to be your 
character’s only interest. Weapon Master halves the penalty for rapid strike,
so it gives you a portion of the advantage of Extra Attack. We generally rec-
ommend the 20- or 25-point level of Weapon Master, though any of the higher
levels is equally useful (though perhaps not as cost-effective).
Flight (40)
The ability to travel faster than average and to take the high ground in
combat provides significant tactical advantage. And, besides, flying is a lot 
of fun. Of course, Flight is not available in most campaigns, but in a world
where NPCs can fly, it’s a good idea to make sure you have at least one flying
PC. When possible, take Flight as part of a racial template — the cost is usu-
ally balanced with some disadvantages that don’t count toward any cam-
paign limits. If you want to have the ability to fly only in certain situations,
consider an Alternate Form that has natural flight (such as a bird of bat).
Gadgeteer (50)/Gizmos (5)
Being a Gadgeteer is a full-time occupation. If you take this advantage, it needs
to be the focus of your character. But if the campaign is suited to having a
Gadgeteer, we find it one of the most enjoyable roles to play. We only recom-
mend the 50-point version because, otherwise, the time limitations may make
it difficult to bring your inventions into play. The other aspect of the role that
is particularly fun is the Gizmos advantage, which gives you the ability to pull
what you need out of your pocket.
High Manual Dexterity (5 per level)
Any characters who intend to work with their hands (thieves, mechanics, or
musicians, for example) benefit from this advantage. It is much more cost-
effective than raising each individual skill.
378
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Intuition (15)
No matter how carefully you gather information and try to plan, some deci-
sions seem to come down to the toss of a coin. Intuition means that the GM
has to give you some advice as to which is the better choice. The only diffi-
culty with this advantage is remembering to use it. Unlike most of the others
in this list (which are always available), Intuition is most useful if you remem-
ber to ask the GM the appropriate questions.
Luck (15)
Luck is useful at any level, but we feel the 15-point version is the one that you
are most likely to be able to afford. With Luck, you have the ultimate safety
net — if you don’t like the outcome of a die roll, you may change it (the level
of Luck you have purchased determines how frequently you are able to use
this ability). Luck is particularly valuable in a high-risk campaign.
Magery (5 + 10 per level)
In the minds of many people, being able to wield magic is what role playing
games are all about. That isn’t true of GURPS, but playing a mage is certainly
fun and is a definite departure from anything you are likely to experience in
your own life. When Magery is available as an advantage, at least one
member of the party should have it.
Rapid Healing (5)/Very 
Rapid Healing (15)
Much of adventuring is about combat, and one of the consequences of
combat is being injured. Unless magical healing is readily available, investing
in Rapid Healing is a very wise decision and one we heartily recommend.
Also consider High Pain Threshold for dealing with injuries during combat
instead of after.
379
Chapter 23: Ten Advantages We Like

Talent (5, 10, 15, or 20 per level)
For us, creating a character is about knowing the interests of that character
and having a concept of his role both within the party and in the society of
the world. Talents represent an interest or a “natural gift” in collections of
skills. Adding a Talent or two to a character provides a depth of personality
that individual skills do not.
380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Chapter 24
Ten Disadvantages That 
Aren’t Too Painful
A
ny disadvantage should limit your character in some meaningful way,
but a disadvantage should never make your character less enjoyable for
you to play. Selecting disadvantages is possibly the most personal aspect of
defining a character. What one person can shrug off or enjoy as a challenge,
another may find extraordinarily frustrating and limiting. This list represents
our recommendations for disadvantages that we’ve enjoyed playing and that
don’t limit our characters’ success in most campaigns.
Note that SCM stands for self-control modifier and is discussed in Chapter 5.
Appearance (Variable)
Deciding to be less attractive isn’t something that most of us would willingly
do. But when creating your character, it is definitely something to consider. In
fact, you can use a less-than-normal appearance to add richness to your char-
acter. The homely hero has a lot of potential for fun.
Charitable (–15 SCM)
We admit it: We tend to play good guys. And if your character is going to be
nice to everyone he meets, you should probably consider taking a disadvan-
tage that represents that. Of course, Charitable means more than just being
nice — it means you’ll help others with less consideration of the risk or cost
to yourself. But unless your character has another trait that makes that a
problem, or if your GM runs the campaign with an eye toward the economics
of the world, this gives you an opportunity to do good works and get points
for them. If appropriate for your game world (and if your GM approves), you
can achieve a similar effect with a Sense of Duty.

Curious (–5 SCM)/Incurious (–5 SCM)
No player is completely uninterested in the mysteries of the campaign, but
you may decide that your character isn’t interested, in which case we recom-
mend taking the Incurious disadvantage. Or you may recognize that your
character really wants to know what’s going on, so Curious is more appropri-
ate. But whichever route you go, we find that our characters almost always
have one or the other of these disadvantages. That said, don’t be foolish and
abandon your free will — make sure that you keep your self-control modifier
at a reasonable level so that if you need to resist temptation (or want to go
exploring some option if you have Incurious), you can try to overcome your
character’s natural inclinations.
Colorblindness (–10)
Do not take this disadvantage if you want to be a merchant, a thief, or an elec-
trician. But if your character is mostly about hitting things or having abstract
knowledge, Colorblindness is a reasonable disadvantage to consider. In real
life, Colorblindness comes into play very frequently. In most campaigns, a
good GM will make it matter occasionally, but you will frequently be able to
work around the limitation with a bit of creativity or some help from others.
Do not take this disadvantage if you want to be an alchemist, demolitions
expert, or tracker. For those, creative GMs can turn coloblindness into a crip-
pling disadvantage.
Duty (Variable)
Giving your character a Duty disadvantage provides a framework for your
character’s personality, career, and decision-making because you must con-
sider how the consequences of each action relate to fulfilling your character’s
Duty. Certainly Duty isn’t appropriate for all characters, but we find that for
many, it is a good disadvantage to explain why they’re involved in such a
crazy adventure in the first place. Be warned, however, that Duty exists pri-
marily to give the GM a way of influencing your actions, so don’t be surprised
when she takes advantage of the opportunity.
382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Impulsiveness (–10 SCM)
If you are naturally impulsive or impatient and are going to play your charac-
ter that way, then by all means take this disadvantage. If, however, you are
very cautious by nature, then we actually recommend against this disadvan-
tage because you may become frustrated when your GM forces you into situ-
ations that you would rather avoid. Having an impulsive character in the
party has its upside, too: It is one good way of making sure that the action
continues to flow along. Overconfidence is a related disadvantage to con-
sider; however, we find it a bit riskier than impulsiveness because it changes
how you engage in combat.
Odious Personal Habits (–5/–10/–15)
An Odious Personal Habit (OPH) is something that all the other characters in
the party find annoying. Make sure that the other players in the group don’t
find it annoying as well. But as long as you keep that in mind, an OPH pro-
vides a cornerstone for your character’s personality. OPH is also a good
catch-all disadvantage for some negative aspect of your character that you
can’t represent with other disadvantages. (Minor things should be repre-
sented with quirks and positive aspects with perks.) Compulsive Behavior is
a related disadvantage to consider, although it’s less amusing to play.
Pacifism (–5/–10/–15)
We can’t conceive of a situation in which we would create a character with a
goal of harming innocents, so the 10-point version of Pacifism, Cannot Harm
Innocents, seems like a natural disadvantage for many of our characters. It
does definitely limit your actions, however, and often calls for greater creativ-
ity in planning attacks, but it’s usually a good match for our characters’ (and
our) personalities. The 5-point version, Reluctant Killer, is another good
option, though we find it requires more role playing and thus a bit more work
from us as players (so the 10-point version seems a better investment).
Both of the 15-point versions of Pacifism (Self-Defense Only and Cannot Kill)
can be run and are appropriate for some characters in some campaigns. The
key item to keep in mind with the higher-point version is that you are respon-
sible for limiting the actions of the rest of the party as well. These are also
dangerous disadvantages in any world in which your characters may be put
383
Chapter 24: Ten Disadvantages That Aren’t Too Painful

into the role of guerrilla warriors. We don’t recommend the –30-point version
(Total Nonviolence) as we find it too limiting for most campaigns. Other
Codes of Honor are equally good choices, although they must be appropriate
for the campaign and should be approved by the GM.
Phobias (Variable SCM)
We love phobias for our characters. A phobia adds an element of personality
that can come into play in all sorts of situations, from the humorous to the
life-threatening. With a little bit of research, you can find a phobia to match
any character concept and then write a background story to explain how it
came about. Of course, it will be harder to find one if you have Cyberphobia
(a fear of computers). Be cautious about taking Phobias at too high of a point
value, however; a Phobia truly can be a crippling disorder.
Weirdness Magnet (–15)
Almost all of our adventures have had someone in the party with Weirdness
Magnet. As GMs, we tend to restrict how many party members can have it,
but as players, we enjoy being the one who will have strange and possibly
wonderful things happen randomly. The only people for whom we do not rec-
ommend Weirdness Magnet as a disadvantage are those who need pre-
dictability in the way in which their characters will develop.
384
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Glossary
Ability: An advantage that gives a character something special he or she can
do. Abilities may or may not be modified with enhancements and limitations.
Active defense: An active defense is a conscious attempt to avoid an attack;
a dodge, parry, or block. Active defenses require a roll to determine whether a
character successfully defends.
Advantage: A useful character quality that gives you the edge over other
characters with your same attributes and skills. You purchase them with
character points.
Adventure: What characters do during the game. One adventure is one opera-
tion, mission, or intrigue that characters engage in. Several related adven-
tures are called a campaign.
Adversary: 1) Any nonplayer character who is hostile to the party of player
characters. 2) An assistant GM show plays enemy NPCs.
Attribute: A number that describes and defines a character’s mental and
physical assets. There are four basic attributes: Strength (ST), Intelligence
(IQ), Dexterity (DX), and Health (HT). Each attribute may have secondary
characteristics that it determines.
Basic Speed: A measure of how fast a character reacts to things, determined by
adding a character’s Dexterity and Health scores and dividing the sum by 4.
Campaign: A series of adventures presided over by the same Game Master,
usually forming one storyline.
Character: The person one pretends to be in a role playing game or any other
personality played in the game.
Combat monster: A character designed primarily to fight and controlled by
the Game Master. Not an official GURPS term.
Companion: A nonplayer character whom the Game Master includes in the
campaign as a member of the party, without being an Ally, Patron, Contact, or
Dependent. Not an official GURPS term.

Control: 1) An advantage from GURPS Powers that allows a character to con-
trol one specific element, material, or force. 2) A Patron nonplayer character
whom one or more player characters owe a Duty toward. Controls can be
very helpful in maintaining plot focus. Not an official GURPS term.
Crony NPC: NPCs who are friendly to or allied with the player characters and
are supportive of their actions and adventures.
Damage resistance (DR): A characteristic describing a character’s ability to
resist damage. Each point of damage resistance (DR) absorbs one point of
damage a character would otherwise take. A player increases DR by buying
armor, by playing a species with a tough hide, or by some similar means.
Default: A character’s skill level with a skill that has no points in it. Defaults
can be based on another similar skill that a character does have points in or
on an attribute.
Dexterity (DX): One of the four basic attributes. Dexterity is the most common
base for physical skills, and along with Health, determines a character’s Basic
Speed and movement.
Disads: Short for disadvantages.
Disadvantage: A limiting or disadvantageous character quality that a player
receives extra character points for taking.
DR: See Damage resistance.
Dungeon: Any dwelling or structure that may act as a setting for the adventure.
DX: See Dexterity.
Exotic: A term used to describe advantages that are not available to mundane
characters.
Fatigue and fatigue points (FP): A secondary characteristic equal to Health
(unless otherwise adjusted), Fatigue is a measure of how quickly a character
grows tired. Fatigue points are temporarily expended to use magic spells and
other special abilities.
Fnord: If you have to ask, you’re not ready to know yet.
Game Master (GM): The person who creates the campaign and plays all the
nonplayer characters and adjudicates the rules.
386
GURPS For Dummies 

Game world: The fictional or fictionalized world created by the Game Master,
in which characters act. A “world” need not be a planet, but could be a coun-
try, asteroid, universe, or whatever background setting the GM creates.
GM: See Game Master.
Health (HT): One of the four basic attributes in GURPS, HT is the measure of
how robust a character is. HT determines how many points of fatigue a char-
acter has and, along with Dexterity, what a character’s basic speed is.
Hit Points (HP): A secondary characteristic equal to Strength unless other-
wise adjusted. Hit Points indicate how much injury a character or object can
take before it dies, goes unconscious, or is destroyed.
HT: See Health.
Injury: Temporary Hit Point loss due to an attack, found by subtracting the
target’s Damage Resistance from the attack’s basic damage and modifying the
resulting penetrating damage for damage type. Weapons do points of damage;
characters take points of injury.
Intelligence (IQ): Character skills that reflect knowledge or mental prowess
are usually based on the basic attribute IQ. IQ determines the starting value of
the Perception and Will secondary characteristics.
Mage: A character with the Magery advantage.
Mana: The energy that powers magic. Mana is usually an environmental
factor and may be present in greater or lesser amounts.
Mana level: The amount of mana that is locally available. There are five
levels of mana: none, low, average, high, and very high. Mana levels affect
how spells work.
Maneuver: The actions available for a character to perform during a combat
turn. For example, Attack, Move, All-Out Defense, and so forth. In the third-
edition GURPS, these were called “actions,” and third-edition “maneuvers”
are now called “techniques” in fourth edition.
Mastermind: The nonplayer character (usually an adversary) whom the Game
Master determines is the guiding influence and intellect behind the cam-
paign’s conflict. Not an official GURPS term.
Milieu: The setting or environment in which a campaign takes place.
387
Glossary

Mini-mind: One of potentially several individually created nonplayer charac-
ters who work to promote the agenda of the Mastermind in the campaign. Not
an official GURPS term.
Minion: 1) An enhancement to the Ally advantage that means the Ally is loyal
to a character no matter how he is treated. 2) One of the numberless hordes
of nonplayer characters who are described by a template and exist to do the
will of the campaign’s Mastermind (usually). Not an official GURPS term.
Modifier: 1) A number added to or subtracted from the target number of a
success roll — or the actual die roll, for a reaction roll — in order to allow for
a specific situation. 2) A limitation or enhancement.
Move: Movement speed in yards per second. Find ground Move by modifying
Basic Move for your encumbrance level.
Mundane: Normal. Without supernatural or superhuman abilities.
Nonplayer character (NPC): A character controlled by the Game Master.
Party: The collected group of player characters and nonplayer characters who
go on adventures together.
PC: See Player character.
Perception (Per): A secondary characteristic based on Intelligence that deter-
mines how likely a character is to notice things in his environment.
Perk: A 1-point advantage, often designed by the player.
Player: Someone who controls and plays the role of a character and who is
not the Game Master.
Player character (PC): A character that a player role plays.
Point crock: Our term for an ability that is worth more points than were paid
for it, or a disadvantage that gives more points than it’s worth. This is not an
official GURPS term.
Power: A group of related abilities that all come from or are granted by the
same source. For example, a priest might have the abilities to heal the
injured, cure the sick, and turn to the undead. This collection of abilities
would constitute a power. The source would be the priest’s deity.

GURPS For Dummies 

Quick contest: A competition between any two characters that is mediated 
by dice rolls. Each competitor makes a dice roll against a specified skill 
or attribute. The competitor who has the greatest success is the winner.
Frequently a quick contest is between the skill of one character and an
attribute of another to see whether the skill succeeds. Another common 
form of quick contest is using the same attribute for each of the characters;
the one with the higher attribute has an advantage but does not necessarily
succeed.
Quirk: A character trait designed to round out a character. A quirk is 
essentially a –1-point disadvantage, but does not necessarily have to be 
disadvantageous.
Role: The persona one takes when role playing one’s character.
Roll: The resulting total of rolled dice.
Run: To control an aspect of the game. As a player, you “run” a character. As a
Game Master, you “run” a campaign. This is not an official GURPS term.
Scenario: The scene or situation in which the adventure or campaign takes
place.
Self-control modifier (SCM): A multiplier that adjusts the point value of some
disadvantages (marked with SCM). The higher the modifier, the more points
the disadvantage is worth, and the lower your self-control number is.
Self-control number: In some mental disadvantages, a number that repre-
sents your character’s chances of overcoming the disadvantage by willpower.
You must roll under this number — always a 6, 9, 12, or 15 — to avoid apply-
ing the disadvantage in a given situation. Taking a disadvantage with a lower
number is worth more points, but it is harder to overcome.
Sidekick: An Ally nonplayer character who functions in (and was created to
function in) a supportive, logistical role rather than attempting to go into
danger with the player characters. Not an official GURPS term.
Skill level: A number representing how competent a character is with a given
skill. It is the number a player must roll under to succeed with the skill, which
may be modified according to the difficulty of the situation.
Spear-carrier: A nameless, faceless nonplayer character enemy. An opponent
that wasn’t important enough for the Game Master to spend a lot of time
developing. Not an official GURPS term.

Glossary

Spell: A skill with a magical effect. Usually only useable by characters with the
Magery advantage; some weaker spells can be used by characters without
the Magery advantage in areas of high mana.
Strength (ST): One of the four basic attributes in GURPS, Strength determines
how many hit points a character has and how much damage a character does
with muscle-powered weapons.
Technique: A specialization in a specific procedure in a more general skill,
which a character may train in and thereby increase independently of the skill
itself. In third-edition GURPS, these were called maneuvers. Techniques are
frequently associated with martial arts but can be used with many types of
skills.
Technology level (TL): A number used as a rough guide to how technologi-
cally advanced a society is. Technology level determines what equipment,
weapons, and armor are available to the characters.
Turn: The time that a character gets to take an action during combat. A turn
is one second long.
Will: A secondary characteristic equal to Intelligence, if not otherwise modi-
fied. Will represents the strength of a character’s mental focus and is useful
to resist fear, stress, and many supernatural effects.
