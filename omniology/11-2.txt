ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES  
& ANALYSIS 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. Explain how new bicarbonate is generated when 
ammonium ions are eliminated by the body. 
 
2. Explain how new bicarbonate is generated when 
fixed (titratable) acids are eliminated from the body. 
 
3. Explain the classification of the four acid-base  
disorders.  
 
4. Describe how metabolic acidosis is differentiated 
from respiratory acidosis.  

Daily there is a net intake of acid from the diet and  
generation of acid from metabolism. 
 
Body’s responses:  
Buffering by proteins such as Hemoglobin. 
 
Change in ventilation by lungs to remove CO2. 
 
Change in amount of HCO3 and H+ that are lost in urine. 
MASS BALANCE & pH 

KIDNEY  MAKES NH4 +  
and NEW BICARBONATE 
PCT cells generate HCO3
- and secrete NH4+. 
 
NH4+ is reabsorbed in the TAL and then 
secreted as NH3 by the CD.  
 
In the CD lumen, the NH3 binds a H+. NH4+ is 
excreted into the urine. 
 
 

DCT & CD EXCRETE FIXED 
ACIDS and NEW HCO3
- 
CD principal cells trap H+ as fixed acids & 
generate new HCO3- to increase blood pH.

MASS BALANCE FOR 
NET ACID EXCRETION 
Acid Input  = ~70 mEq/day   
Acid Output = ~ 40nEq/day  = pH 7.4 urine 
 
Daily total acid secretion* by the kidney: 
 
 
Fixed acids produced   
 
    34 mEq 
NH4+ produced  
 
 
    35 mEq 
Acidic urine pH (free H+) 
 
    negligible

 NAE = (UNH4 x V) + (UTA x V) – (UHCO3- x V)

1. What is pH of arterial blood?  
This determines state: normal, acidemia, or alkalemia. 
 
2. Is it metabolic or respiratory disorder and is the  
process acidosis or alkalosis or mixed?  
Examine the [HCO3-] (normal 24 mEq/L) and PaCO2  
(normal 40 mm Hg). Compensation is never complete 
so change in pH reflects disorder. 
 
3. What is the compensatory mechanism?  
Metabolic disorders result in compensatory changes in PaCO2.  
Respiratory disorders result in compensatory changes in [HCO3-].   
HOW TO ANALYZE  
ACID-BASE DISORDERS?  

CASE: 
 
Mary is dehydrated from 2 days of severe diarrhea. 
Labs: Blood pH is 7.3 and blood [Na+] 143,  
[HCO3-] 16 mEq/L,  and PaCO2 33 mmHg.  
 
1. What is her acid-base state?  
 
acidemia 
 
alkalemia 
 
normal 
 
2. What is the underlying process? 
 
A. metabolic acidosis 
 
B. metabolic alkalosis 
 
C. respiratory acidosis 
 
D. respiratory alkalosis 
  

KEY CONCEPTS 
1. Daily diet and metabolism generates a net  
increase  in acids.  
 
2. The kidneys maintain acid-base homeostasis by  
reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate, forming titratable  
(fixed) acids and excreting ammonium ion NH4 
+). 
 
3. There are four types of acid-base disturbances.  
 
4. Acid-base disturbances are classified as to the  
Direction of change in pH (acidosis or alkalosis) and  
by the underlying problem (ventilation or metabolism).
