About the Author 
Hagen Graf was born in July 1964. Born and raised in Lower Saxony, Germany, his 
first contact with a computer was in the late seventies with a Radioshack TRS 80. 
As a salesperson, he organized his customers' data by programming suitable applications. 
This gave him a big advantage over other salesmen. With the intention of honing his 
skills, he joined evening courses in programming and became a programmer. 
Nowadays he works in his wife's consulting company as a trainer, consultant, and 
programmer (http://alternative-unternehmensberatung.de). 
Hagen Graf has published two other books in German, about the Apache web server and 
about security problems in Windows XP. Since 2001, he has been engaged in a nonprofit 
e-learning community called "machm-it.org e.V.", as well as in several national and 
international projects. All the projects are related to content management, community 
building, and harnessing the power of social software like wikis and weblogs.  
He chose Mambo CMS because of its simplicity and easy-to-use administration. You can 
access and comment on his blog (http://hagen.take-part.org). 
 
For the first time in my life, one of my books has been translated from German to English. 
I wish to thank the team of Packt Publishing, especially Louay, Wolfgang, Michelle, 
Abhishek, and Paramita for making this possible. I also wish to thank the Miro and Mambo 
team, especially Alex Kempkens and Brian Teeman. They have done a very good job. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Acknowledgement 
This book was developed during the course of a trip. First, I would like to thank the many 
café owners who allowed me to plug my computer into a socket free of charge. I would 
also like to encourage the hotspot operators to create more WLAN places in the world 
and not to make access too expensive. A commendable example of this is the very 
friendly Wifirst in Paris (http://www.wifirst.fr/index.jsp), which together with the 
Metro operator RATP (http://www.ratp.fr/) operates an affordable WLAN at many 
Paris locations. 
In addition, I wish to thank my daughter Isabell (http://www.isapisa.de/) and my 
wife Christine for their help and encouragement. I also wish to praise Skype 
(http://www.skype.com/) and Jabber (http://www.jabber.org) project; without these 
two, our communication with editorial team would not have been possible. 
Alex Kempkens (http://www.thinknetwork.com/), development team member of 
Mambo, author of the Mambelfish component and the editor for the German book project 
deserve special thanks for their patience in reading the manuscript and the suggestions 
they made. And without Boris Karnikowski's (editor of the book at Addison Wesley) 
integral strengths, you surely would not be holding this book in your hands. 
Most of all, I want to thank you, my readers. Let me know how you liked the book!

Introduction 
Mambo is a piece of software that makes it easy to administer content. I will describe this 
administration of content in detail during the course of this book. This book about 
Mambo is being developed on a trip: I am constantly on the move while attending to my 
work. My work consists of activities such as lecturing, advising, listening, testing and 
trying, programming, learning how to understand structures, trying to get to the bottom of 
things, and constantly testing. So, why am I writing a book about content management 
while I am on the road? 
Well, the world has become more mobile in the last few years. "More mobile" means that 
even the laptops bought at the supermarket will operate on battery for more than four 
hours. Their screens are readable in sunlight. Wireless Internet hotspots are affordable. 
But more mobility also means customers from different countries, with different 
languages and cultures can now interact without ever meeting. This means long road, rail, 
or air trips for the necessary, but less frequent personal meetings and short response times 
for customers' e-mail inquiries. The charming 24/7 abbreviation hits mobility's nail on the 
head—24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Mobility has ramifications on what we used to call an office as well. Five years ago, it 
was normal to store e-mails on your home or office computer. Today, various service 
providers are offering almost inexhaustible disk space for these purposes. 
In larger companies, terminal servers are becoming more and more influential. The 
bandwidth of Internet connections is increasing. All this means that you are no longer 
tied to your home PC, but can access your pool of e-mails, pictures, and documents from 
any Internet café. This makes you more independent, since your office is suddenly 
located at any place with a browser and an Internet connection. 
In the eighties, Sun Microcomputers proclaimed, "The net is the computer". With the 
increasing proliferation of web-based applications such as e-mail services, online 
banking, group calendars, document-management systems, communities, dating services, 
and online auctions, this claim has become a reality today. Your own terminal is 
increasingly becoming less important. Even mobile telephones today can send and 
receive e-mails, take and send photographs, and do much more. 
Today, a company, an institution, an association, or an organization needs an Internet 
presence that is also mobile—one that is in tune with the times, can be easily modified 
from a browser, and can also be expanded without complication. This website is the place 
where you will explain to others what you do and what your company does. 

Introduction 
It is the place that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to enable you to maintain 
your customer relations. Until recently, the production of such a homepage was a difficult 
task. You didn't have to be a designated specialist, but needed perseverance and interest 
to make the result more appealing. You had to create static HTML pages with an HTML 
editor and subsequently load them onto the server via File Transfer Protocol. To provide 
even the simplest interactivity, like a guest book or a forum, you had to learn a 
programming language. Many people, for understandable reasons, were reluctant to take 
on this hardship and handed over the production of their homepage either to a web 
agency or decided not to start such a project at all. 
However, rescue is near, because now there is Mambo! 
This book deals with the production of a simple website. We use the Mambo Content 
Management System to do that and show how an attractive, interactive homepage can  
be created and maintained without programming knowledge and without recourse to an 
HTML editor. 
This website resides on a central server. Access to all functions is available from any 
terminal with an Internet connection. This means that you can maintain and update your 
website from any Internet café in the world or even from your mobile telephone. 
Enjoy the experience of learning in the world of Mambo! 
What This Book Covers 
Mambo is a full-featured content management system that can be used for everything—
from simple websites to complex corporate applications. This book begins by introducing 
the basic principles that underlie the operation of Mambo. 
Chapter 1 explains the difficulty of defining a term such as 'content management'. It 
explores the structure of a CMS and lists the various features of Mambo. To get an 
overview of the areas of application for Mambo, a few Mambo-based websites are used 
as examples. 
Chapter 2 guides us through the process of installing Mambo in an appropriate server 
environment. It lists the prerequisites for Windows and Linux, and cites the need for 
selecting a directory for installation. 
Chapter 3 guides us through a tour of the created homepage and Chapter 4 deals with the 
customization of Mambo, according to the users' needs. It shows us how to install a local 
language file for different users. It also explains the configuration of Mambo 
administration and shows us how to install new Mambots.  
Chapter 5 deals with the creation of extensions. Few content management systems 
provide web accessibility for users with disabilities and Mambo is one of them. The 
xMambo project tries to make Mambo web pages usable by people with disabilities.

Introduction 
Chapter 6 explains the corporate identity of an enterprise. It studies the Internet 
technologies that Mambo works with— HTML/XHTML, CSS, and XML. It also shows 
us how to create our own template packages. Chapter 7 teaches us how to extend the 
functional range of Mambo with new components, modules, and Mambots. 
Appendix A provides a list of necessary software packages. It also guides us about what to 
do if we forget our admin password.  
What You Need for Using This Book 
The prerequisite for this book is a working installation of Mambo. To run Mambo, the 
typical environment consists of PHP/Apache/MySQL. We cover the details of installation 
in Chapter 2. 
Conventions 
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different 
kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of  
their meaning. 
There are three styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows:  
Create a subdirectory called com_mambobook under the [mambo]/administration 
/components/ directory. 
A block of code will appear as follows:  
// Examine access rights 
if (!($acl->acl_check( 'administration', 'edit', 'users',  
$my->usertype, 'components', 'all' ) | $acl->acl_check( 
'administration', 'edit', 'users', $my->usertype, 'components', 
'com_newsfeeds' ))) { 
mosRedirect( 'index2.php', _NOT_AUTH );  
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant 
lines or items will be made bold: 
'com_newsfeeds' ))) { 
mosRedirect( 'index2.php', _NOT_AUTH );  
New terms and important words are introduced in a bold-type font. Words that you see 
on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in our text like this: 
"clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen".  
Tips, suggestions, or important notes appear in a box like this.

Terms and Concepts 
Before you can understand how to operate Mambo, you need to understand the basic 
principles that underlie the system. 
1.1 Content Management System 
Content Management System (CMS) contains the terms content and management 
(administration) that imprecisely refer to a system that administers content. Such a 
system could be a board and a piece of chalk (menu or school chalkboard), or it could be 
something like Wikipedia (the free online encyclopedia at http://www.wikipedia.org), 
or an online auction house such as eBay (http://www.ebay.com/). In these cases 
contents and participants are administered. These participants play a major role with 
CMS, on one hand as administrators and on the other hand as users. 
But it gets even better. Apart from CMSs there are Enterprise Resource Planning 
Systems (ERP, administration of corporate data), Customer Relationship Management 
Systems (CRM, care of customer contacts), Document Management Systems (DMS, 
administration of documents), Human Resource Management Systems (HRM, 
administration of staffing), and many others. 
An operating system such as Windows or Linux also administers content. It is difficult to 
define the term CMS because of its encompassing nature and variety of functions.  
Lately ECMS has established itself as the nickname for Enterprise Content 
Management Systems. The other abbreviations listed above are the subsets of ECMS. 
Mambo belongs to the category of Web Content Management Systems (WCMS), since 
it exclusively administers content on a web server. 
Since these terms are still relatively new in the enterprise world, these systems will surely 
be developed even further. In principle, however, there will always be an integration 
system that tries to interconnect all these systems. In general, the term 'content 
management' is used in connection with web pages that can be maintained by a browser. 
This doesn't necessarily make the definition any easier. 

Terms and Concepts 
1.2 A Quick Glance into History 
While the Sun maintained in the nineties that "the Network is the computer", Microsoft 
was not going to rest until a Windows computer sat on every desk. 
The computer that Microsoft was concerned with was a mixture of data files and binary 
executable files. Files with executable binary contents are called programs, and were 
bought and installed by customers to manipulate data. Microsoft Office was the winner in 
most of the offices around the world. The computer that Sun was working with was a 
cheap, dumb terminal with a screen, a keyboard, a mouse, and access to the Internet. The 
programs and data were not stored on this computer, but somewhere on the net. 
The mine philosophy governed Microsoft's practices whereas the our philosophy was 
adopted by Sun. The motivation for these philosophies was not for pure humanitarian 
reasons, but for economic interest. Primarily, Microsoft sold software for PCs to the 
consumer market, Sun, on the other hand, sold server hardware and programs to the 
enterprise market. 
The Internet, invented in the sixties, spread like an explosion in the mid-nineties. Among 
other things, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), the language used to write web 
pages, and the development of web servers and web clients (browsers) helped its 
expansion. The Internet itself was a set of rules that could be understood by different 
devices and was developed so skillfully that it covered the entire planet in almost no time. 
An individual without an e-mail address could no longer be reached and a company 
without a website was not only old-fashioned, but didn't exist in the eyes of many 
customers. The whole world swarmed to the Internet within a short time to become a part 
of it. Movies like The Matrix (http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/) became 
huge hits and 1984 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984), a book by George Orwell, 
was forgotten. 
New net citizens on one hand came from the mine world and on the other hand from the 
our world. Those who were used to buying programs bought HTML editors and created 
Internet pages with them. The others preferred to write their own HTML code with any 
text editor they had on hand. And the web agency, where one could order a homepage, 
was born. 
Both groups faced the problem that HTML pages were static. To change the contents of 
the page, it had to be modified on a PC and then copied to the server. This was not only 
awkward and expensive, but also made web presences like eBay or Amazon 
(http://amazon.com/) impossible. Both groups found more or less good solutions for 
this problem. 
The mine faction, developed fast binary programs, with which one could produce HTML 
pages, and load them via automated procedures onto the server. Interactive elements, 
such as visitor counters, among others, were built into such pages.

Chapter 1 
The our faction discovered Java applets and with them the capability of writing a 
program that resided centrally on a server, which was operated via a browser. Entire 
business ideas were based on this solution—like online booking and flight reservation 
concepts. Both groups tried to develop market share in different ways. 
The result was quite a stable market for both, in which passionate battles over the correct 
operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) constantly drove the version numbers 
higher and higher. Customers got used to the fact that the whole thing wasn't that easy. 
There is always a third option in these situations. As in our case, it was the emergence of 
open-source scripting languages like PHP (http://www.php.net/). Rasmus Lerdorf had 
the goal of offering interactive elements on his homepage and with that a new 
programming language was born. From the outset, PHP was optimized in a perfect 
cooperation with the MySQL database, which also worked on the GNU/GPL platform 
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). 
Fortunately, on the server there was a Linux operating system and an Apache web server 
that offered the necessary infrastructure. Display medium at the client side was the 
browser, which was certainly available. Soon LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) 
became synonymous with database-supported, interactive presence on the Internet. 
The most diverse systems like forums, communities, online shops, voting pages, and 
similar things that made it possible to organize contents with the help of a browser were 
developed in an enthusiastic creative rush. 
After 'difficult' things such as Linux and Apache, 'soft' products were developed. The 
nineties were nearing their end; the Internet share bubble burst and suddenly the trend 
was to build unmitigated classical business models with unmitigated classical methods. 
Whenever the economy isn't doing well, costs are scrutinized and the possibility of 
lowering costs is contemplated. There are now, as there were earlier, numerous 
possibilities. PHP applications always had distribution numbers in the millions. Only the 
phpBB (http://www.phpbb.com/) and phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net) 
projects are mentioned here as examples. One was developed into the quasi-standard for 
forum software, the other one into the standard for manipulating MySQL databases via 
web interfaces. The source code of the PHP language and that of applications were 
improved because they had an enormous number of users and developers. 
The more open a project was, the more successful it became. Individual gurus were able 
to save enterprises immense costs in the shortest time. Static HTML pages were 
considered old and expensive and were overhauled. They had to be dynamic! Developers 
have been working in this environment for a few years now. Linux, Apache, MySQL, and 
PHP are readily accepted in industry. The search for professionally usable PHP 
applications has begun.

Terms and Concepts 
With this search one looks for: 
• 
A simple installation process 
• 
Easy serviceability of the source code 
• 
Security of the source code 
• 
User-friendliness 
• 
Easy expandability 
The special advantage of PHP applications is the independence from hardware and 
operating system. LAMP also exists as WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) 
for Windows, MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) for Apple, and for numerous 
other platforms. And now finally our Mambo comes into the fray. 
1.2.1 Mambo 
The Australian company Miro (http://www.miro.com.au/) developed a CMS with the 
name of Mambo in the year 2001. It made this system available as open-source software, 
to test it and to make sure of a wider distribution. In the year 2002, the company split its 
product Mambo into a commercial and an open-source version. The commercial variant 
was called Mambo CMS, the open-source version Mambo Open Source (MOS). In the 
meantime all parties involved have agreed that MOS can officially be called Mambo and 
together a successful future for the fastest developing CMS of the moment is secured  
(http://www.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id= 
14&Itemid=0). 
The advantages of the commercial version for companies are primarily in increased 
security and that they have the company Miro as a partner that also supports further 
development. The advantage the open-source version offers is that it is free and an 
enormous community of users and developers alike provide continuous enhancements. In 
addition, it is possible for enterprises to take Mambo as a base and to build their own 
solutions on top of it. 
1.3 Structure of a CMS 
1.3.1 Frontend and Backend 
A CMS consists of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is the website—what the 
visitors and the logged-on users see. 
The backend, on the other hand, contains the administration layer of the website for the 
administrator. Configuration, maintenance, cleaning, creation of statistics, and new 
 
8 

Chapter 1 
content creation are all done in the backend. The backend is at a different Uniform 
Resource Locator (URL) than the website. 
1.3.2 Access Rights 
Whenever we talk of management, we talk of the clever administration of existing 
resources. In a CMS, usernames are assigned to people involved and these are provided 
with different access rights. This ranges from a simple registered user through an 'author' 
and 'editor' up to the 'super-administrator', who has full control over the domain. Based 
on the rights, the website then displays different content, or the user works in 
administrative areas apart from the website. 
1.3.3 Content 
We handle all kinds of content; in the simplest case, it is text. But content can also be a 
picture, a link, a piece of music, or a combination of everything. To keep an overview of 
the content, one embeds it in structures, for example, texts of different categories. The 
categories, of course, are also content that need to be administered. 
1.3.4 Templates 
A template is a kind of visual edit format that is placed on top of content. A template 
defines the colors, character fonts, character sizes, background pictures, spacing, and 
partitioning of the page—in other words, everything that has to do with the appearance of 
the page. 
1.3.5 Extensions (Components) 
Every system has to be expandable and be able to grow with the requirements. 
Functionalities that belong into one context are also covered by the term components. 
For example, typical components are an online shop, a user manager, a newsletter 
maintenance system, or a forum. Components contain the business logic of their page. 
Modules within the components are used to integrate content in the desired form into 
templates. For example, a recent news module supplies the headings of the five most 
recent pieces of news to the template. Another module delivers the number of users that 
are online at the time, or the meteorological data for your current town or city. 
1.3.6 Workflow 
By workflow one understands a work routine. The bureaucratic set of three (mark, punch, 
and file) is an example of a workflow. A recipe for baking a cake is a workflow. Since 
several people usually work with CMS content, well-organized workflows are a genuine 
help. In this connection, one sometimes speaks of work supplies that a certain user has.
 
9

Terms and Concepts 
For example, the editor sees a list of posted pieces of news, which he or she has to 
examine for correctness. After examining, the editor marks the pieces of news as correct 
and they appear in the work supply of the publisher. The publisher then decides whether 
to publish the piece on the front page. 
1.3.7 Configuration Settings 
Settings that apply to the entire website are specified using the configuration settings. 
This includes the title text in the browser window, passwords for search engines, switches 
that permit or forbid logging on to the site, or that switch the entire page offline or online, 
and many other functions. 
1.4 Mambo as Real Estate 
Mambo is a kind of construction kit that lets you, once it is installed on the server, create 
and maintain your website. Mambo is like a house that you build on a property of your 
choice and that you can furnish gradually. Thus, to a certain extent, it is real estate. 
Stop! I was talking about mobility all the time and now I'm asking you to build real 
estate? Have no fear, the real estate you build, is physically at one place (your server), but 
is accessible from every place. To make a piece of real estate habitable, you need 
necessary services such as heating, electricity, and water supply. That is the reason your 
Mambo is deposited at as safe a server as possible, where hopefully the electricity will 
never be cut. Think of the abbreviation 24/7. 
Just like your house, you also have a certain room layout in Mambo. You have a room for 
presentations, for cooking and talking, for working, and a completely private one that you 
only show to good friends. Perhaps you also have a large room that integrates all areas. 
It doesn't matter which room layout you decide on. You have to furnish your house, lay a 
beautiful floor, paper the walls, hang a few pictures, and of course, clean it regularly. The 
numerous guests leave traces that are not always desirable. To find your house the 
visitors need an address. This address has to be familiar to as many people as possible. 
Since there is no residents' registration office on the Internet, you have to be the one that 
takes care of the topic, "How can I be found?" 
Perhaps you also have a garden that surrounds your house and has different entry gates. 
There is an official entrance portal, a back door, and perhaps another small, weathered 
garden gate for good friends. 
And perhaps you don't like such houses and would rather use trailers, tents, mobile 
homes, hotels, or maybe prefer community living and are glad to pay rent and don't want 
to think about all the details. 
 
10 

Chapter 1 
If you apply the last few sentences to your website, then you are already noticing how 
important it is to know what you want, who you are, and how you want to look at your 
community. One cannot not communicate! One can, however, be quickly misunderstood. 
So plan your website on the Internet properly. Put thought into the texts, into possible 
interactive elements like a calendar or a forum, and of course, an area that only registered 
users are allowed to see. 
Think about what prompts that move and don't patronize users. Take a look at how others 
do it. Talk with the people you want to address through your website and invest your 
heart and soul into those things that are absolutely crucial for the success of your entry. 
1.4.1 Mambo Versions 
As with all software, there are different development versions with Mambo. This book is 
concerned with version 4.5.2. As you can see from the relatively high version number, 
Mambo is quite developed and tested. 
Versions 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, and 4.5.4 released in 2005 are compatible with one another. 
This compatibility is important with security updates and with the use of external 
components and modules. A guest book component that was written for version 4.5.1 
also runs under version 4.5.2 and subsequent versions. 
A previously planned version 4.6 is not going to be released. The current road map was 
published at the end of February 2005 (http://mamboserver.com/menu/ 
Mambo_4.5_and_5.0_Roadmap/). The next version jump will be released in the  
beginning of the year 2006 with version Mambo 5. At this time, the version carousel  
is still turning quite rapidly with Mambo. Version 5.0, however, will bring with it a 
slowdown in development. 
Regardless of which version you use, the fundamental concepts and application flow are 
the same in all versions. 
1.4.2 Mambo Features

Installation 
In this chapter, we will go through the process of installing and running Mambo. To 
install Mambo, we must have the dream team mentioned in Chapter 1 installed as the 
development environment: Apache, MySQL, and PHP. 
Mambo does not make any special demands on Apache or MySQL. PHP has to be of 
version 4.1.2 or higher and it should be compiled with support for MySQL and Zlib. Zlib 
is a library that makes it possible for PHP to read file packages that are compressed with 
the ZIP procedure. 
We can use any web server that works with PHP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
Web_server). From version 4.5.3 of Mambo, it will be possible to use databases other 
than MySQL. The installation has to be done on a server that can be accessed over the 
Internet, usually located at the Internet provider. 
Before we venture into the wilderness of the Internet, we should first practice on our local 
computer. This is an advantage as there are no connection fees, it is very fast, and we can 
practice at a leisurely pace. We can even have a small local network at home where we 
can install Mambo on one computer and access it from another. 
All the necessary downloads discussed in this book can be downloaded from 
http://www.alternative-unternehmensberatung.de/component/option,com 
_weblinks/catid,2/Itemid,40/lang,en/. A list of file packages can be found in the 
Appendix. These files are suitable for local installation, since the examples in this book 
can be reconstructed that way. 
Remember, however, there are more current versions on the respective project sites on 
the Internet. If you install Mambo in the wild, on a server on the Internet, you should 
always use the latest stable version. 

Installation 
2.1 Setting Up the Local Server Environment  
To install Mambo locally, we have to set up the appropriate server environment. 
2.1.1 Windows 
Due to the user-friendliness of Windows, over 90 percent of computers work with 
Windows as operating system. Unfortunately, Apache web server, MySQL database, and 
PHP are not included with Windows. A practical approach would be to install each of 
these programs separately, or grab a preconfigured package. 
Log on to the system in administrator mode. To check your account type, click Start | 
Control Panel | User Accounts and change it to Computer administrator if required: 
 
Figure 2.1: User Accounts
XAMPP for Windows 
XAMPP is a project of Kai 'Oswald' Seidler and Kay Vogelgesang. These two have been 
creating a complete development environment with the ingredients Apache, MySQL, 
PHP, Perl, and various extensions for several years.  
XAMPP can be downloaded from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html as 
zip archives for various operating systems. This is an immense advantage for people like 
you and me, who are primarily interested in Mambo and not so much in how all of it 
works. Also, the entire installation can be removed from the computer with one mouse-
click without leaving a trace. To download and install XAMPP: 
 
18 

Chapter 2 
1. Download the xampplite-win32-1.4.14.zip file from 
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#641 and 
extract it on the local drive: 
 
Figure 2.2: Xampplite Directory
2. Open the setup_xampp.bat file from the xampplite folder. XAMPP makes 
no entries in the Windows Registry and sets no system variables: 
 
Figure 2.3: Execute Setup_xampp.bat 
 
19

Installation 
3. PHP starts automatically as a module. To start Apache, open the 
apache_start.bat file from the xampplite folder. A command request 
window opens, which indicates that Apache has started: 
 
Figure 2.4: Start Apache Web Server 
The command request can be minimized, but closing it will terminate  
Apache web server. 
4. Start MySQL by opening the mysql_start.bat file. As opposed to Apache, 
MySQL has a separate script to terminate itself. To accomplish this, open the 
mysql_stop.bat file. 
 
Figure 2.5: Start MySQL
5. Open the website http://127.0.0.1/ or http://localhost/ to check if 
XAMPP is correctly installed. On the XAMPP start page, click on the 
English link and the start page shows up (Figure 2.6). 
The document directory of your website is htdocs in the xampplite folder. This 
directory contains all the pages that are accessible by a remote computer on the Internet.  
More information on usernames and passwords can be found in the readme_en.txt file. 
To uninstall the package, close all current servers and delete the xampplite directory. 
 
20 

Chapter 2 
 
Figure 2.6: XAMPP Start Page 
Mambo Stand Alone Server 
The Mambo Stand Alone Server (MSAS) project offers complete installation of 
Mambo 4.5.2, Apache, PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin. The setup msas452-setup.exe 
file can be downloaded from http://www.mambosolutions.com/main/content/ 
view/13/59/. After the installation, we get an executable Mambo system in the MSAS 
folder. Since this book covers the installation of Mambo, xampplite has been used. 
2.1.2 Linux 
With Linux everything is usually simple. Different distributions with different standard 
configurations are available. Usually our dream team is pre-installed and just needs to be 
started. An XAMPP version can also be installed for Linux. My opinion, however, is that 
it makes more sense to grab the original programs. The installation is done by a package 
manager and is very simple. 
SUSE (9.1) 
With the help of a configuration program YaST, you can check whether Apache, 
MySQL, and PHP are already installed. If that is not the case, select the appropriate 
packages for installation and let YaST install them. These are the packages in detail: 
• 
apache2, apache2-level, and apache2-mod_php4 
• 
mysql and php4-mysql 
 
21

Installation 
You can find these packages via the YaST interface on your SUSE distribution media or 
on the Internet: 
 
Figure 2.7: YaST Accessed from a Windows PC in a Shell
Start the Apache web server with the command /etc/init.d/apache2ctl start and the 
MySQL database server with /etc/init.d/mysql start. 
You can stop both the servers with the command stop. By typing help, you get an 
overview of all parameters. 
Debian 3.1/Sarge 
With Debian, the agent of choice is apt. You can install Apache, MySQL, and PHP with 
the program apt. 
apt-get install [packetname]
The following are the packages in detail: 
• 
apache-common: Support files for all Apache web servers 
• 
php4: A server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language 
• 
mysql-common: MySQL database common files (e.g. /etc/mysql/my.cnf) 
• 
mysql-server: MySQL database server binaries 
You can find these packages automatically over the Internet or on the Debian CD/DVD 
by using apt. 
Then start Apache with the command /etc/init.d/apachectl start and MySQL with 
/etc/init.d/mysql start. 
 
22 

Chapter 2 
Your Own Server at a Provider 
If you have rented a complete server from a provider, then you usually have a shell 
entrance and free choice of the Linux distribution that you want to use. In addition, the 
system is preconfigured and contains all necessary file packages and configurations. 
Usually special administration interfaces, such as, Confixx (http://www.sw-soft.com/ 
en/products/confixx/) or Visas are used for configuring these servers. You can 
comfortably start, stop, and configure your server and the Apache and MySQL services 
from a browser interface with this tool. 
2.2 On a Virtual Server in the Net 
The hosting industry changes very rapidly. Check out the forum on 
http://mamboserver.com/ for actual hints about installing Mambo on  
different servers. 
2.3 Installing Mambo 
To install Mambo, download the latest stable version MamboV4.5.2-stable.tar.gz from 
http://mamboforge.net/frs/?group_id=5. 
2.3.1 Selecting a Directory for Installation 
One has to decide whether Mambo needs to be installed directly into a document 
directory or a subdirectory. This is important, since many users prefer a short URL to 
their homepage. 
An Example 
If Mambo is unzipped directly in /htdocs, the web page starts when the domain name 
http://www.myhomepage.com is accessed from its local computer http://localhost/ 
and/or from the server on the Internet. If subdirectories are created under /htdocs/, for 
example, /htdocs/mymambo/ and we unzip the package there, we have to enter 
http://localhost/mymambo/ in the browser. This isn't a problem locally, but doesn't 
look good on a production Internet page. 
Some HTML files and subdirectories, however, are already in /htdocs in the local 
xampplite environment under Windows, which, for example, displays the greetings page 
of xampplite (as shown in Figure 2.6). In a local Linux environment, a starting page 
dependent on the distribution and the web server settings is also displayed. 
 
23

Installation 
2.3.2 Local Installation of Mambo 
Directory 
In Windows, create a subdirectory named mambo under the document directory by using 
Windows Explorer. The directory tree in Windows Explorer should look like this: 
 
Figure 2.8: Mambo Directory
In Linux, use the shell KDE Konqueror or Midnight Commander: 
[Document home]/htdocs/mambo/
An empty index appears in the xampplite version when the URL 
http://localhost/mambo is entered in the browser: 
 
Figure 2.9: Apache Directory Display
With Linux or with another configuration it can happen that you don't get a message and 
therefore you don't have access to this directory. This depends on the configuration of the 
web server. For security reasons, the automatic directory display is often deactivated. A 
potential hacker could draw many interesting conclusions about the directory structure 
and the files on your homepage. From this information the hacker could target your 
computer for hacking. 
Unpacking 
In Windows XP the MamboV4.5.2-stable.tar.gz file can be directly unpacked from 
Windows Explorer. In all other versions of Windows a separate unpacking program is 
 
24 

Chapter 2 
required, for example, the shareware program Filzip that can be downloaded from 
http://www.filzip.com/en/index.html. 
In Linux, type the following command to unpack the file package, called a compressed 
tarball, in the prepared directory: 
–zxvf MamboV4.5.2-stable.tar.gz
After unpacking, the following directories and files can be seen in Windows Explorer: 
 
Figure 2.10: Mambo Source Code Files
This structure is same on all operating systems—only the presentation differs. The 
following figure shows a presentation in an FTP client where the local PC is in the left 
window and the remote web server in the right: 
 
Figure 2.11: Mambo Files in FTP Client WSFTP 
 
25

Installation 
Mambo Web Installer 
From now on, everything is going to go lightning fast because the Mambo web installer 
will be taking over command. Go to the URL http://localhost/mambo/ where the  
web installer announces itself with a pre-installation check. This check determines 
whether your environment is suitable for installing Mambo. If there are many green  
test results, then it is already a good sign. Depending on your configuration there can  
be differences here.  
The web installer takes the configuration settings of Apache, PHP, and the operating 
system into consideration. On Linux-based systems, attention should be given to writing 
rights. If you are working with the xampplite solution under Windows, the web installer 
should look as shown in the following figure: 
 
Figure 2.12: Pre-Installation Check
Click on Next to get the announcement of the GNU/GPL license, which you must accept 
by marking the I Accept the GPL License field. The installation with the web installer 
takes place in the following four steps: 
Step 1 
Database parameters are queried in a questionnaire. You can set up as many databases as 
required in xampplite server environment. As there is a MySQL user set up with the 
 
26 

Chapter 2 
name root without a password, enter the name of a database that doesn't exist yet in the 
installer. Users usually have the rights to access databases in a working environment. 
Enter the following parameters in a local xampplite installation: 
 
Figure 2.13: Database Configuration
Host Name: localhost
MySQL User Name: root
MySQL Password: (leave this empty—but be aware of the security risk!) 
MySQL Database Name: mambo452
MySQL Table Prefix: The web installer writes the text that is entered in the field before 
producing each table. By default, the web installer suggests mos _, because sometimes 
you get only one MySQL database from an Internet provider. 
If two Mambo pages are required to be operated, there would be a problem, since you 
cannot differentiate one table from the other. By means of Table Name Prefix, it is 
possible to keep apart the tables of different Mambo installations (mambosmith_ or 
mambojones_). At this time you should accept the default mos_. 
Drop Existing Tables: If you are dealing with a 'new' installation into an empty database, 
do not check this check box. If there is an old version of Mambo in your database, you 
can overwrite the old files by checking this check box. 
Backup Old Tables: With Mambo, data security (backups) can be set up. The backups are 
stored in special backup tables. To replace old backup tables, check this check box.
 
27

Installation 
Install Sample Data: By default, this check box is checked. This fills your homepage with 
sample data so that you get a conception of its appearance down the road. Fill your 
installation with these sample data; we will work with them later on in the book. 
Click on the Next button. After a security question, asking whether the installation should 
indeed go ahead, the web installer creates the database and the appropriate tables. 
Step 2 
 
Figure 2.14: Site Name
In step 2, you secure the name of your website. This name shows up in the header of the 
browser window when someone accesses your website. This name is also used in other 
places, for example, with confirmation e-mails to registered users. Select a meaningful 
name. For our example page, we have chosen the name mambo452. Click on Next to set 
the name. 
Step 3 
 
Figure 2.15: Confirmation Screen 
 
28 

Chapter 2 
In step 3 you must confirm a few basic settings. These settings are important as they 
permit the Mambo system navigation on your server. 
URL: This is the URL of your homepage. 
Path: This is the file path on your server that leads to your homepage. In our case it is in 
the Windows environment. 
Your E-Mail: Enter your e-mail address. As a Super Administrator you will receive e-mail 
from your homepage. 
Admin password: Mambo suggests a password. You can accept it or create a similarly 
complicated password. A simple one would be sufficient for a local installation. 
Accept the default options in the File Permissions and Directory Permissions dialog. 
During installation, Mambo automatically sets access rights to those parts of the system 
where files are uploaded or programs are installed. 
Step 4 
 
Figure 2.16: Successful Installation
The fourth and final step congratulates you on a successful installation. 
There is a notice in bold, red text that prompts you to delete the installation directory. 
Take good heed of this notice, because your Mambo website will not run if you don't 
delete the directory. 
In addition, your Administration Login Details are indicated. Note down the username  
and password. 
 
29

Installation 
Mambo assigns a new password when you go backwards from step 4, for 
instance, if you want to change your settings or if the installation wasn't quite 
successful. If you have forgotten or mislaid the administrator password, there is a 
solution in the Appendix. 
The installation is now complete. You have a choice between View Site (to start your 
homepage) and Administration (administration interface). To take a look at your newly 
created homepage, click on View Site. If you haven't deleted the installation directory 
as of yet, you will get a friendly reminder to delete it and to check out your page after 
you've done that. 
 
Figure 2.17: Homepage After Installation

Chapter 2 
The result is very impressive. Look it over at your own pace, click on a few options, and 
try to orient yourself. Lot of Mambo's functionalities are used on this homepage, which is 
loaded with example data. We will take a good look at these.

A Tour of Your New Homepage 
Now that you have installed your homepage and carefully explored it, we can take a look 
at the result together. At first glance, these pages look a bit confusing. In principle, they 
are divided into a frontend and a backend. Customers and web surfers see the frontend; 
the backend is only accessible by coworkers and/or administrators. 
3.1 Frontend 
After spending some time on the homepage, you will realize that many different 
functions are integrated into the page. In order to get a better overview, I have marked 
and labeled the different areas of the page, illustrated in Figure 3.1 overleaf. 
The art of web design now consists of recognizing the elements that are important for 
your homepage, omitting the unimportant ones, and presenting it to the user in a logical, 
easy-to-understand, and attractive format. The result is always a compromise between 
functionality and organization. 
From the configuration, this structure reminds one of a daily newspaper or a portal like 
Yahoo! or Freenet. On the left and right there are boxes with clearly defined contents. In 
the centre are announcements. 
A so-called template determines the layout of the page. Templates are exchangeable and 
modifiable, meaning that the same content can be displayed in different layouts. Every 
daily newspaper would envy you for this functionality. Let's go over the example layout a 
bit more closely.

3.1.1 Menus 
Menus are there to make navigation on the page as easy as possible for the user. There 
are different menus for different tasks. Mambo has four kinds of menus in the example 
data. You can add as many additional menus as you want. The fourth menu, by the way, 
is not shown in our example. The registered user sees the so-called user menu after he or 
she has logged on.

Chapter 3 
Top Menu  
The top menu is as high up on the page as possible. It gives the user quick access to the 
most important content of the page. Such a menu often displays products, contacts, and 
company information: 
 
Figure 3.2: Top Menu 
Main Menu 
The main menu is the central navigation area of the page. There should always be a link 
to return to the first page. This menu should appear in exactly the same position on every 
page of the website. The main menu is an important orientation place for the user: 
 
Figure 3.3: Main Menu 
Other Menu 
An additional menu, the other menu can pop up in all kinds of places (module 
positions). Depending on the content and context of the page it can make sense to offer 
additional menu options: 
 
Figure 3.4: Other Menu 
3.1.2 Content 
Finally the content that we want to manage is here!

A Tour of Your New Homepage 
What is Content 
Content can be a message, an editorial article, or a static page with explanations.  
Content can be also a dynamic link directory (http://www.google.com/), a shop 
(http://dell.com/), or a flea market (http://www.ebay.com/). 
Content can also be something completely dynamic and open to everybody. The free 
encyclopedia Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/), for example, uses a content 
administration system that allows everyone to change the content. This special form of 
content administration is called wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). 
Everyone can change and even delete content. So far it is working amazingly well. 
The opposite of wiki is static content, which once written, is valid for a long time. For 
example, take this book. It will become outdated regarding the version numbers of the 
software discussed, although it has the advantage of explaining and illuminating the topic 
comprehensively in that connection, at present. I produce content in a certain format and 
therefore operate a type of content management. 
Folders, flyers, stickers, business reports, and manuals are also usually of static nature. 
Created for a certain event, after some time they become outdated or simply wrong. 
Many older web pages consist exclusively of static elements. On the Internet, however, 
the clock ticks a little faster. That which is complaisantly tolerated with books, folders, 
and other printed materials (after all, I can also read the book at the beach and in the 
subway), is regarded to be a serious shortcoming by visitors to your website. Nothing is 
worse for the image of your company than a four-year old static website with a button 
announcing "Powered by...", which refers to hopelessly outdated software. 
The presentational possibilities of content are inexhaustible. They depend on the 
available terminal, bandwidth, and many other things that are in turn dependent on the 
user. The user of the message plays an increasingly important role. Who actually forms 
your target group? 
A platitude says, "Content is king!" 
It depends on the content. Every web agency would now probably crack a smile and get 
on with the daily job of creating the next website. Millions of dollars in advertising 
budgets for products such as frozen spinach or beer are proof of the fact that successful 
communication also works without unique content. The statement that content is crucial, 
is, however, fundamentally correct. If you have nothing to say or nothing to offer, nobody 
will listen to you of his or her own free will. Since you probably don't have a million-
dollar advertising budget, you also can't force people to do it. No matter how beautiful 
websites without content may look, or how many terminals may display them, nobody 
will voluntarily visit them. 
 
36 

Chapter 3 
First Page/Front Page 
Content is announced on the first page of the website, as illustrated in Figure 3.5. Content 
has an author, a date of preparation, a heading, a hook, and perhaps a picture. The hook is 
to make the visitor curious and to get him or her to click on a Read more link in order to 
read the entire message: 
 
Figure 3.5: Front Page 
The Latest Messages/The Most Often Read Messages 
The message can be displayed in different formats. People are usually interested in the 
newest and in what others are reading as illustrated in Figure 3.6: 
 
37

A Tour of Your New Homepage 
 
Figure 3.6: The Latest Messages/The Most Often Read Messages 
Because of that, our example layout has an appropriate area within which the last five 
messages are always displayed, and another area where the most read messages are 
announced. This second area is possible, because Mambo logs each hit on a message in 
the database and tracks the number of times it has been accessed. 
Plan the content of your site carefully! Everyone in the world can read it and use 
it against you in cases of doubt. You could become the victim of a litigation 
lawyer, disappointed colleagues, or other unpleasantries. 
On the other hand this has an unbeatable advantage: Everyone in the world  
can read your content, add his or her opinion to it, and contact you. What an 
opportunity!  
You should be aware of both of these directions when you conceptualize content. 
3.1.3 Advertising 
When your site becomes popular and if the content is right, you can sell advertising 
space. Advertising space usually means banner links. 
Banners are small graphics (in .gif, .jpg, .png, or .swf format) that induce the visitor 
to leave your website via a single click on the banner. If you really want that, look for a 
space in your layout and consider using it for advertising. 
Banner Area 
The size of the banner area is determined by the current banners. In our case this is 468 x 
60 pixels as illustrated in Figure 3.7: 
 
38 

Chapter 3 
 
Figure 3.7: Banner Area 
3.1.4 Functions 
Functions are elements needed to make interactivity possible. In Mambo these functions 
are called modules. A module is something that takes up space on the web page and 
fulfils a certain function. 
Login Area 
A login module is important if you want to separate your website into a public and a 
protected area. The visitor then has to have a way of registering and of logging on. 
Perhaps he or she even occasionally forgets his or her password. The login module 
should be able to take all situations into consideration as illustrated in Figure 3.8: 
 
Figure 3.8: Login Module 
Polling 
Since our content is designed for certain target groups, we should now and then ask the 
group that actually surfs our site for their opinion. This is the simplest way of getting 
utilizable opinions about your site. 
Mambo has integrated a survey component, whose display module is on the example 
page as illustrated in Figure 3.9: 
 
39

A Tour of Your New Homepage 
 
Figure 3.9: Survey Module 
Who is Online 
This module is about communication and community. After the user has been able to see 
which messages are recent and particularly popular, naturally he or she would like to 
know who is navigating the site right now. In this case a distinction is made between 
guests and logged on users as illustrated in Figure 3.10: 
 
Figure 3.10: Who is Online? 
Feeds 
News feeds are becoming more and more popular. These are standardized collections of 
content, which can be processed further—the content of your site, without the dead 
weight of the rest of the website. The syndication module (Figure 3.11) offers the most 
diverse feeds:  
 
Figure 3.11: Syndication Module 
 
40 

Chapter 3 
You will learn more about this technology in Section 4.7.7. 
Deliberate carefully whether you want to offer such features on your website. If 
you claim in your content that you are the largest website in U.S. and only one 
guest cavorts on your site, it will hurt your credibility. But if you do indeed 
constantly have 10-20 visitors and logged on users, then this is a good way to 
demonstrate dynamics. 
Back 
Back is a small word of great importance and forms a giant portion of user friendliness. 
After one has pressed on a link, sometimes it is not at all easy to return exactly to the spot 
where one was just before. The Back button tries to make that possible: 
 
Figure 3.12: Back 
Search Field 
Similar to the Back button, the Search field also contributes greatly to the user 
friendliness of a website. Many pages have search fields. Often, however, the programs 
behind the search field don't scan the entire content of the page. With Mambo, however, 
all pages are definitely scanned: 
 
Figure 3.13: Search Field 
You can type a search term and press Enter on the keyboard. The result is a hit list, with 
the desired term visually emphasized. 
3.1.5 Decorative Elements 
After so many functions, modules, and contents, the issue of design, corporate identity, 
and the look and feel of the website pops up. 
A template represents the layout of the page and is laid on top of the content like a 
screen. Since it is hard to argue either about taste or beauty, you have the option of 
providing different templates for the same content. For example, the look of your website 
in winter could be different than that in summer, or it could have a baseball look during 
the World Series. Chapter 6 deals with the creation of your own templates.
 
41

A Tour of Your New Homepage 
In principle, a template consists of one or more logos, a certain color combination, 
selected character fonts and sizes, and as clever an arrangement of the available content 
as possible. There are two logos (Figure 3.14) and a footer line (Figure 3.15) in the 
example template: 
 
Figure 3.14: Logo 1, Logo 2 
 
Figure 3.15: Footer 
3.1.6 Prospects 
After this tour and from your own experience, I am sure you can understand that the 
administration of contents can be a very demanding task. Above all, it is important not to 
lose sight of the overview. 
3.2 Backend 
The administration of the website takes place in the backend with the name Mambo 
administration. You can reach the Mambo administration under the URL [Domain 
name]/administrator/. 
If you are working with a local installation, the URL is 
http://localhost/mambo/administrator/
Log on with your admin ID as shown in Figure 3.16. 
You have specified the user data yourself in the web installer during installation. 
You will see an interface with menus, icons, and tabs, identical to the graphic interface of 
your operating system, as illustrated in Figure 3.17: 
 
42 

Chapter 3 
 
Figure 3.16: Mambo Administration—Login 
 
Figure 3.17: Mambo Administration 
In a working environment you should, for security purposes, protect the directory 
[mambo]/administrator/ with a .htaccess file. Because of the widespread use 
of Mambo, the first successful hacker attempt at the administration is expected.

Customizing Mambo 
Customizing means the adaptation of a standard program to the needs of the user. In our 
case, you are the user and the standard program is Mambo Open Source, or more exactly 
the frontend of your Mambo installation. 
In the Mambo administration (referred to in Chapter 3), you can adapt your site, make 
changes, and fill it with content. 
Typically, the first two things that the owners of a site want to do are to adjust the 
language to the native language and to change the colors and layouts. So, we will first 
discuss these two things. 
4.1 The First Attempt  
In case you want to reach a native target group with your site, you should understand the 
language of the target group and build the site in that language. If you want to address an 
international audience, you should use English as the standard language. Regardless of 
which language you choose, you need a customized language file. As a base, it's best to 
take what is already available. 
4.1.1 Installation of a Different Language File 
For example, if you want to reach a German target group, download the 
m4.5.2_germani.zip and m4.5.2_germanf.zip files. The i stands for informal and f for 
formal language. 
Log on to Mambo administration as described earlier and click Site | Language Manager 
| Install as shown in Figure 4.1: 

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.1: Language File Installation
 
 
 
Now click Browse and select the m4.5.2_germanf.zip file. Click Upload 
  
File & Install. If 
all rights are correctly set, you will receive the message: 
Upload language  
– Success
After one click on the Continue link, you will see the available languages. Besides 
English there is also 'German formal-you (Sie)' and a bit of information about the creator 
of the language file. In the other ZIP archive is the German version with the 'familiar-you 
(Du)' way of addressing. If you want, you can install this version as well.  
The green checkmark for the standard language, however, is still for English. If you want 
to select the German option, click Publish, which is on the right, above the Language 
Manager. The icons that finalize actions and dialogs are always in this position: 
 
Figure 4.2: Language Selection

Chapter 4 
4.1.2 Translation of a Menu Entry 
Your frontend now speaks German. Go to http://localhost/mambo/ and take a good 
look at the search field and the login module. Click the Search link in the main menu. 
This page displays both German and English languages. Everything that is programmed 
to function automatically, like the search procedure or the login procedure, is in German; 
everything else is in English. 
Why? The answer is quite simple. Only the words and sentences that are programmed in 
can be translated. A large part of the page, however, consists of entered content. This 
content appears in the language in which it was entered. In our case, the sample data was 
provided in English. 
Before you try to translate the sample page, look at the buttons in the Language Manager. 
Besides Publish, there are New, Edit, Delete, and Help. Mambo's online help can be 
accessed by clicking the Help button. 
With the New button you can install new language packages and with Delete you can 
erase them. But the Edit button is really interesting. Select the language that you want to 
see and click Edit. The Language Editor opens and you can make changes online, as 
shown in Figure 4.3: 
 
Figure 4.3: Language Editor 
 
47

Customizing Mambo 
Browse through the language file for a while. You will get a feel of the Mambo functions 
by doing this. 
At present, the language file is writable, thus alterable from PHP or any other tool. If you 
are of the opinion that the translation was successful and you want more security, simply 
mark the appropriate check box to make the file read only. The write rights are now 
revoked for this file and granted next time for memory procedures only. In order to 
restore the original rights situation, you have to change the file rights from your FTP 
client or from a shell with the command chmod. Click Save or Cancel if you wish to exit 
the Language Editor. 
What do you have to do in order to change the menu entry Search into Suchen or to 
rename the Main Menu into Hauptmenü? 
Exit the Language Editor and click Menu | mainmenu. You are now in the Menu 
Manager. Click the Search link as shown in Figure 4.4 and edit it in the form that appears 
on your monitor as shown in Figure 4.5: 
 
Figure 4.4: Menu Manager 
Don't worry yet about the numerous configuration options; simply replace the word 
Search with Suche and click Apply. You will now see Suche on the Main Menu of  
your site!

4.1.3 Modifying the Menu Name  
In order to make a Hauptmenü from the Main Menu, open the Module Manager by 
clicking Modules | Site Modules (Figure 4.6). Click on the Main Menu link to get a form, 
just like with the menu entry. Change the text and the Main Menu becomes a Hauptmenü:

Customizing Mambo 
4.1.4 Changing the Template for Your Site 
Now that everything looks a bit more familiar, you may want your site to have a 
completely different design. In order to see what is included in Mambo as standard, 
switch to Site | Template Manager | Site Templates in the Template Manager (Figure 
4.7). "Site" means your website, that is, the frontend. As you can see, there are 
administrator templates: 
 
Figure 4.7: Template Manager 
Three finished templates are included with Mambo. The currently active template is 
marked with a green checkmark.  
If you slide your mouse over the name of the template, a small thumbnail view appears, 
as shown in Figure 4.8. To assign this template to your site, select the radio button before 
the name of the desired template and click Default in the menu bar. Switch to your site 
and click the Update button in the browser: 
 
Figure 4.8: Preview  
 
50 

Chapter 4 
You have a different layout and a completely new appearance. The menus, for example, 
are on the right side, and in addition have the German translations Hauptmenü and  
Suche. After this first round of satisfying our urge to play, we now get to some more 
elaborate customizing. 
4.2 Configuration of Mambo Administration 
Mambo offers nearly the same comfort level as any program with a graphical user 
interface, such as Windows, KDE, Gnome, or Aqua (Mac OS X). This is not self-evident 
for web pages and is made possible by the generous use of JavaScript. JavaScript is 
executed locally on your computer and can be deactivated in the browser. If this is done, 
you can no longer work with Mambo administration. Browsers, however, have been able 
to deal with JavaScript quite well for several years now and there aren't any serious 
security concerns any more. For this reason, you should enable JavaScript. In this 
context, I would highly recommend the open source Mozilla Firefox browser 
(http://www.mozilla.org). It is more secure and easier to use than Internet Explorer. 
 
Figure 4.9: A Different Template 
The Mambo administration, just like your site, consists of different elements.
 
51

Customizing Mambo 
In the top menu bar are the menus and on the right side are two notifications about 
whether you have received messages and how many users are logged on right now. 
Below that is a field with a link that has information about which components are 
applicable to the currently shown manager (infobar). On the extreme right is the toolbar 
with various dimmed icons which are dependant on the manager.  
If you slide your mouse over one of these icons, it lights up. You can click the left mouse 
button and implement the appropriate function: 
Toolbar element 
Relevance 
Publish 
The chosen element is published. 
Unpublish 
The chosen element is hidden from view. 
Archive  
 
The chosen element is moved to the 
archive. 
New/New Item 
The creation of a new element (link, 
contact, and message) is started. 
Edit 
The chosen element is loaded into the 
edit module. 
Delete/Remove 
The chosen element is deleted. 
Trash 
The chosen element is put in the trash 
container. 
Restore/Untrash  
 
The chosen element is retrieved from the 
trash container. 
Move   
The chosen element is moved to another 
section or category. 
Copy 
The chosen element is copied to another 
section or category. 
Save 
The chosen element is saved and the 
dialog is closed.

The changes are saved and the dialog 
remains open. 
Cancel 
The function being worked on is ended 
without any changes being saved.

another element. 
Table 4.1: Toolbar Elements 
Under the toolbar is the workspace of the current manager. As shown in Figure 4.10 this 
is the Control Panel. It is displayed after logging in and offers quick access to the most 
important elements. If you do not see the Control Panel, simply click Home at the top-left 
corner in the menu bar:  
 
Figure 4.10: Mambo Administration 
On the left, there are icons that refer to various managers. On the right, you find five tabs 
that give you an overview of the current status of your site. In the lower area you see a 
navigation bar that extends right across Mambo. Here you can set the number of lines 
displayed and navigate through the table if say 600 users are online at the same time. 
 
53

Customizing Mambo 
This number is quite realistic with well-frequented Mambo sites. Changing the number of 
lines displayed is possible with all table displays. 
Logged gives an overview of the currently logged in users. As administrator, by clicking 
on the red cross (x) next to the user name, you can log the user out. 
Components shows the currently installed software components. If these have  
several options (for example, web links), then this component is represented as  
a heading with subpoints. 
Popular tells you about the most surfed pages of your site. By clicking the page name, 
you switch to the Content Manager and see the respective page in editing mode. If you 
are in edit mode, you have to terminate the function with Cancel or Save and 
subsequently click Home to get back to the Control Panel. 
Latest Items is similar to Popular. Here the content is shown in reverse chronological 
order. One click on the name also switches you to the Content Manager. 
Menu Stats displays the number of menu elements in each menu. 
The menu bar consists of eleven options. On the far left is the Home link that sends you 
back to the Control Panel. On the far right you can see the Help link. 
You can configure the Control Panel by clicking Modules | Administrator Modules. 
4.3 Help Menu 
A call for help often resounds when you are immersed in work! With Help, Open Source 
differs drastically from other licensed program products. If you need assistance, you can 
ask or check the online archives of developers and users. If you have the necessary 
experience, you can even check the source code directly. 
You will find an overview of the important items in the Help menu. This menu includes: 
• 
A glossary 
• 
An introduction to the people behind Mambo (credits) 
• 
Tips for finding help on the net (support). Check http://forum. 
mamboserver.com, for answers to your questions 
• 
http://help.mamboserver.com as the online help system for Mambo 
• 
System information that allows you to check under which conditions your 
Mambo installation will work

Figure 4.11: Mambo Online Help 
On the left side of the page is a keyword list, behind which the respective help texts hide 
as shown in Figure 4.11. Before you post questions in the forum, please look at these help 
files and the posts in the forum contributions of others! 
The Mambo Help work area is divided into three sections. On the top there is a search 
field and a bar with links as shown in Figure 4.11. On the left is an index of the available 
help texts and on the right is the main display area. By default, anything new about 
Mambo 4.5.2 is displayed in this space. All but two links refer to the server http:// 
help.mamboserver.com/. In order to use this search, you have to be connected to the 
Internet. You have to do this unless you are working with a local version. Two other links 
refer to the text of the GNU Public License and to system information about your server 
as illustrated in Figure 4.12. This information is divided into three tabs: 
 
55

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.12: System Information 
System Info displays a summary of the most important data. Right now I am working 
locally with Windows and the xampplite environment (for the installation procedure, 
refer to Chapter 2). Therefore I'm running very up-to-date software versions (Apache 
2.0.53 and PHP 5.03), compared with the servers rented on the Internet. 
PHP Info displays all information from the phpinfo() function. This is the complete 
configuration of the PHP interpreter. 
Permissions displays the rights of your subdirectories. In order for Mambo to run error-
free, all directories must be writable. 
4.4 Site Menu 
There are settings that apply to all individual pages and to your server. All of these 
settings are summarized in the Site menu. 
 
Figure 4.13: Site Menu

Chapter 4 
4.4.1 Site: Global Configuration 
The global configuration workspace administers changes in the configuration.php file. 
In it are vitally important pieces of information, like the access details for the database 
server. This workspace is divided into ten tabs: 
 
Figure 4.14: Site  
Site 
Site Offline: If, for instance, you are carrying out changes to your site and you don't want 
visitors to track your development progess, you can turn off your site. 
Offline Message: The text entered here is displayed on your site when it is switched off. 
If you want to use another logo, you can save one with the name of 
[mambo]/images/logo.png. Otherwise, you have to customize the path accordingly. 
 
Figure 4.15: Display notice when  
the site is switched off

Customizing Mambo 
System Error Message: Here you can type in a message that is displayed if no connection 
can be established with the database server. 
Site Name: This is the name of the page that you entered during the installation. 
Show UnAuthorized Links: You have the ability to display individual pages only to 
registered users. It is possible that these pages get linked from a public connection.  
If you choose Yes, these links are displayed. When a visitor who has not logged on  
clicks on such a link, a message appears announcing that this is a protected area that 
requires registration. 
Allow User Registration: Here you can select whether you want to permit users to do their 
own registration or not. If you operate a company site, you could set up user accounts for 
your coworkers, but forbid them to create their own account. With a community site, on 
the other hand, it is desirable for users to log themselves on. 
Use New Account Activation: In order to protect yourself from automated programs that 
can create 20,000 user accounts on your site, you can ask for separate activation. The user 
gets an automatic e-mail sent to the address given by him or her. There is a link in this e-
mail that activates the account. After activation he/she can log on normally. 
Require Unique Email: Choose whether each e-mail address is to be used for one  
account only. 
Debug Site: Here you can switch the site into debug mode. After activating this function, 
the database queries of the site are displayed. In order to generate a single Mambo page, 
79 database queries are required, as shown in Figure 4.16: 
 
Figure 4.16: Debug Mode with Database Queries

Chapter 4 
WYSIWYG Editor: WYSIWYG is the abbreviation for "What you see is what you get" 
which means, "This is what you wanted, here it is!" The term originated at the beginning 
of graphic user interfaces, when it first became possible to see how the printed document 
would look as you typed the text into your word processor. 
On the Internet, you normally fill out forms with no formatting ability. Formatting is 
done by HTML tags or program-specific mnemonics. A WYSIWYG editor is user-
friendly, since you have to click an appropriate icon, just as when formatting text. This 
editor is automatically invoked for the text fields that require formatting as illustrated in 
Figure 4.17. It works with all the usual browsers:  
 
Figure 4.17: WYSIWYG Editor 
Mambo also offers the ability of integrating other HTML editors. The default editor 
TinyMCE is used at this time. You can find out more about it from 
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/. 
List Length: Lists, like news and links, will crop up every now and then on your site. 
With this, you can set the default number of entries that such a list can have. 
Favorites Site Icon: Every site can offer the surfer a so-called favorite site icon
-
 
 
(favicon). This small picture is displayed to the left of the URL, as well as in the 
bookmarks of the browser. This works really well in most browsers:  
 
Figure 4.18: Favicon in Firefox 
In Internet Explorer, however, this works only under certain conditions (compare Figure 
4.18 and Figure 4.19):  
 
Figure 4.19: No Favicon in Internet Explorer (Version 6.0.29) 
 
59

Customizing Mambo 
The icons have to be available in a certain format. You can specify the name for the icon. 
You will find the file in the main directory of Mambo. You can create icons using an icon 
editor such as SnIco Edit (http://www.snidesoft.com/staticpages/index.php 
?page=20050504142037205). 
Locale 
With this tab you can localize your page as illustrated in Figure 4.20. By localization, one 
means adaptation to country-specific conventions. The options available are: 
Language: Here you specify the language of the site. All available languages are 
indicated in the option drop-down menu. Section 4.1.1 discusses how to install new 
language packages. 
Time Offset: This setting can be used to display the correct time; for example, if the 
server that Mambo runs on is located in the USA, but the site is meant for visitors in 
Germany. 
Country Locale: Every country has certain defaults for the display of numbers and dates 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale). With this option, you can specify the 
format. PHP offers the ability of implementing different functions depending on the 
mnemonic entered as locale. The approach is sound; however, this does not always work 
when creating a template. 
 
Figure 4.20: Locale 
Content 
The settings for the content display of the entire site are set here. You may set your 
preferred settings in the following options: 
Linked Titles: Here you can set the title of a content element to be shown as a link. This 
link then refers to the same target, as the Read More link. 
Read More Link: A lot of content consists of a hook (intro text) and the actual text. Here 
you decide whether you want to have a Read More link under the hook, which refers to 
the complete text:

PDF Icon: Should a PDF icon be displayed above the content (see Figure 4.22)? After 
clicking this icon, your content is prepared as a PDF file! In order to view the PDF file, 
you need the free Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/).

Print Icon: Here you can determine whether a print icon is to be displayed above the 
content (see Figure 4.22). After clicking this icon, the content is prepared for printing.  
E-mail Icon: Should an e-mail icon be displayed above the content? After clicking this 
icon, a form is displayed that allows you to send a reference about this content to 
somebody else, as illustrated in Figure 4.25:

Icons: Here you decide whether to show PDF, print, and e-mail as icons or as links. 
Table of Contents on multi-page items: It is possible to write content that covers several 
pages. For that, a Mambot is contained in the text. We will discuss Mambot in greater 
detail in Chapter 7. If you select Show, a table of contents is automatically produced for 
this piece of content. 
Back Button: Do you want a Back button on every page? 
Content Item Navigation: If you select Show here, a bar with the buttons Next and

Customizing Mambo 
Server 
In the server section you'll find more information about settings that you can change: 
 
Figure 4.27: Server 
Absolute Path: The absolute path on your server is the path from the root directory of the 
server to your Mambo installation. On a local machine running under Windows, for 
example, it is C: /xampplite/xampp/htdocs/mambo; on a Linux server however, it is 
/is/htdocs/wp1007226_40G0RIWV3E/www. 
Live Site: The Live Site is the URL by which the site is accessible on the Internet. 
Secret Word: This is the encoded administrator password. Refer to the Appendix to find 
out what to do if you forget your admin password. 
GZIP Page Compression: With this you can enable compression of the pages. If the 
browser and web server support this function, the pages are delivered in ZIP format and 
unpacked by the client browser. This can substantially increase the speed of page 
download, especially with slow Internet connections. 
Login Session Lifetime: If you log on as a user, you produce a so-called session. Unless 
you log yourself out, this session is deleted after the number of seconds that you set here. 
Error Reporting: With these switches, PHP's own error reporting mechanism is activated. 
Option 
Description 
System 
Default 
Here the settings from the configuration file php.ini are used. 
None 
Errors are not logged. 
 
64 

Chapter 4 
Option 
Description 
Simple 
Errors and warnings are logged. This setting corresponds to the 
parameter error_reporting (E_ERROR|
|
E_WARNING E_PARSE) 
Maximum 
Errors, warnings, and references are logged. This setting corresponds 
to the parameter error_reporting (E_ALL) 
Table 4.2: Error Reporting 
Help Server: Here you can register another URL for the Mambo help server. 
File Creation: If files on the server are created by Mambo, the standard rights set up on 
the server are applied to these files. These settings are usually sufficient. If you have 
problems with uploads, select the second option and overwrite the server settings. 
Directory Creation: The setup options described for files (refer to File Creation) also 
applies to directories. 
Metadata 
Metadata is data about data, for example a description of your site. Metadata plays a  
role with search engines. How large this role is, is however disputed. Nevertheless, 
metadata represents a good way to describe your site in short and concise words. If you 
look at the HTML source code of a Mambo page, you can see the following metatags in 
the upper area:  
<meta name="description" content="Mambo - the dynamic portal engine 
and content management system" /> 
<meta name="keywords" content="mambo, Mambo" /> 
Here you can set default values as shown below: 
 
Figure 4.28: Metadata 
Global Site Meta Description: This description of site content is often displayed as the 
result by search engines. One should therefore pay special attention to this tag, because it 
is on the basis of this information that the surfer decides whether to visit your site or not. 
 
65

Customizing Mambo 
Global Site Meta Keywords: Keywords are the most important words in a document. 
They should describe the main purpose of your site. Some search engines particularly 
favor the keywords. Individual words are separated by commas and several words can be 
included between two commas with normal blanks.  
The keywords should be limited to a maximum of 1,000, as more than that are not 
selected. Note that the use of fewer key words helps each individual word get a higher 
priority in the search engine. Deliberate about which the most often used keywords are 
and which are likely to be searched for most. 
Show Title Meta Tag: With individual content pages, the content title is blended in as  
a metatag. 
Show Author Meta Tag: With individual content pages, the author's name is blended in as 
a metatag. 
Mail 
Under this tab, you can decide the methods for sending Mambo mail, as shown below: 
 
Figure 4.29: Mail 
Mailer: Here you can select whether you want to use the PHP mail function, Sendmail, or 
another e-mail account, for example, Yahoo or GMX. 
Mail From: For mail generated by Mambo, this e-mail address is automatically displayed 
as the sender. 
From Name: This name is automatically displayed as the sender for mail generated  
by Mambo. 
Sendmail Path: If, instead of the PHP mail function, you want to use the Sendmail 
program that is presumably available to all Linux servers, you have to enter the path to 
the program in this textbox. 
SMTP Auth: Chose whether you want to use an external mail server. 
 
66 

Chapter 4 
SMTP User: This is your user name for this e-mail provider. 
SMTP Pass: This is your password for this e-mail provider. 
SMTP Host: This is the SMTP server of this e-mail provider. 
Cache 
A cache is a temporary storage facility. Your browser, for example, has a picture cache, 
which makes pictures already downloaded available faster: 
 
Figure 4.30: Cache 
Mambo uses a similar mechanism on the server to cache pages generated by PHP. This 
option can drastically reduce response time with frequently visited pages. 
Statistics 
Here, you can enable or disable the statistics functions for your site: 
 
Figure 4.31: Statistics 
Statistics: Here you determine whether or not to produce statistics. 
Log Content Hits by Date: Here you enable daily-updated content statistics. Not just the 
complete page accesses, but hits on individual elements of an HTML page are also 
tracked here. Unfortunately, there is still no analysis program for this data at this time. By 
the way, very large data sets are produced within a very short time. 
Log Search Strings: This switch can give very interesting results. It collects words that 
visitors to your site enter into the search field. 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 
This subject is about search engine-friendly URLs. Normally a URL of a content 
management system looks like this: 
 
67

Customizing Mambo 
http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_contact&Itemid=3. Such URLs 
are not normally stored by search engines, since the search engine assumes that the 
content is constructed dynamically and will probably change soon. 
 
Figure 4.32: SEO 
Search Engine Friendly URLs: With this switch you can make a search engine-friendly 
URL from a dynamic URL. If you set the switch to Yes, links look something like this: 
http://localhost/component/option,com_contact/Itemid,47/. 
The principle is based on a feature of the Apache web server. With its rewrite engine it 
can manipulate URLs at will. Besides the switch, you also have to rename the file 
htaccess.txt in the Mambo directory to .htaccess. With Windows, such a renaming is 
only possible with certain programs, for example, the Ultraedit editor. With Linux, the 
renaming function is problem-free; the file, however, is subsequently no longer displayed 
in its FTP client (depending on the server configuration). In addition, the provider may 
not permit .htaccess files, since they represent a security risk for the web server. 
Dynamic Page Titles: No matter what, you should switch this to Yes. The title of your 
content is then displayed with the page name in the title bar of the browser window for 
each and every page access: 
 
Figure 4.33: Dynamic Page Title 
4.4.2 Site: Language Manager 
You already know the Language Manager from our first walkthrough (see Section 4.1.1). 
Besides selecting languages for the site, you can also install new language files here. In 
our first attempt, we accomplished this by uploading the language file. Mambo, however, 
also allows you to load files onto the server via FTP and then to install them from the 
filesystem. The advantage with this is that you can install several language files in one 
processing step: 
 
68 

Chapter 4 
 
Figure 4.34: Install New Language 
4.4.3 Site: Media Manager 
You can think of the media manager as a file explorer or an FTP program in your 
operating system. With it, you can upload files with the extensions .gif, .png, .jpg, 
.bmp, .pdf, .swf, .doc, .xls, or .ppt into different directories and administer them. 
This manager is extremely convenient, especially if you have administration rights, but 
no FTP access: 
 
Figure 4.35: Media Manager  
Directory: Select the desired directory, whose content is to be displayed. 
Media Bar: This bar lists the files (media). Depending on the type of file, you will find 
more information about each below. A stylus icon and a trash can icon are displayed. 
With a click on the stylus you can create a complete HTML link, which you can then 
copy and paste into your content. If you click on the stylus of the Mambo logo, for 
instance, the Code field displays the following: 
 
69

Customizing Mambo 
<img src="http://localhost/mambo/images/stories/asterisk.png" 
align="left" hspace="6" 
alt="asterisk.png" /> 
That is the HTML code to display a picture left justified with a border of 6 pixels. 
Upload: Click Browse and select the desired file from your local hard drive. 
Subsequently, click the upload icon in the toolbar. The file is uploaded and displayed. 
Mambo uses media as it is. Remember that it is not a good idea to put a 3 MB picture 
from a digital camera on your web page in that size. On the Internet, pictures should  
be no larger than 50 KB. There are people who still do not have high-speed access to  
the Internet! 
You should have the following times in the back of your mind as a ground rule for the 
download time for 100 KB (about the size of a portal web page with pictures): 
Connection type 
100 Kilobyte download  
DSL 
Depending on the configuration, less than a second! 
ISDN 
About 15 seconds. 
Modem (56 kbps) 
About 25 seconds. 
 Table 4.3: Time taken to download a 100 KB file 
Create Directory: You can enter a name for a new subdirectory in this field. After 
clicking the create icon in the toolbar, the subdirectory is created and can be selected 
from the options list in the top area (directory). 
4.4.4 Site: Preview 
Here you get a preview of your site: 
 
Figure 4.36: Preview 
You have three options: 
• 
In New Window: The preview is displayed in a new browser window. 
 
70 

Chapter 4 
• 
Inline: The preview is shown in the workspace, with scroll bars on the sides, 
if the page is too large to fit on the monitor. 
• 
Inline with Positions: The preview is shown in the workspace, with markings 
for the individual module positions. 
4.4.5 Site: Statistics 
Here you can evaluate the statistical data, which you hopefully enabled in Section 4.4.1 
on the Statistics tab as shown in Figure 4.37: 
 
Figure 4.37: Statistics 
Browser, OS, Domain: In this area you get three flags with information as to which 
browser, operating system, and domain has visited your site. This is based on the data 
that a browser supplies automatically to the web server. If, for example, Google visits 
your site with a program to incorporate your pages in its index, no information  
is transferred. 
The maximum upload size per file depends on the PHP configuration of  
your provider. In my case it is 16 MB. Larger files would have to be uploaded  
via FTP. 
Page Impressions: Here you can see the individual pages, the creation date, and the 
number of hits. 
Search Text: The search words entered by your visitors are tracked here. 
4.4.6 Site: Template Manager 
You are already familiar with the Template Manager from where we installed another 
template for the site in Section 4.1.4: 
 
71

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.38: Template Manager 
Site Templates 
Here you can set up the templates for your site. 
Default: Pick a template and click the default icon to use it as the default template for 
your site. 
Assign: Select a template and click on assign to apply it to individual pages: 
 
Figure 4.39: Assign 
The existing menu elements are indicated to you. Mark the appropriate elements that you 
want to apply to the template. You can chose more than one by holding down the Control 
key while clicking on all desired elements one after the other. 
 
72 

Chapter 4 
New: Here you install a new template, like the language file from Section 4.1.1. There is 
a large selection of existing templates (http://www.mambohut.com/), which you can 
install either by means of an upload or via installation from a directory. 
Edit HTML/Edit CSS: Here you can work directly on the HTML or CSS source code of 
the selected template (as shown in Figure 4.40). Templates always consist of an HTML 
and a CSS file: 
 
Figure 4.40: HTML Editor 
I'm sure that seeing how a template is developed is interesting even for the beginner. 
Delete: Here you can completely delete an installed template. 
Install 
This is the installation mask for site templates. You wind up here if you click New in Site 
Templates or if you come directly from the menu Site | Templates Manager | Install. You 
can install new template file packages by uploading or by doing a directory installation. 
Administrator Templates 
What applies to your site, naturally also applies to the administration interface. You  
can assign other templates and install new ones, just like with the site templates of  
your administration interface. Mambo includes two administrator templates that you  
can chose from. 
Install 
Just as with the site templates, you can also install administrator templates. You wind up 
here if you click New in administrator templates or if you come directly from the Site | 
 
73

Customizing Mambo 
Templates | Install menu. New template file packages can be installed by uploading or by 
a directory installation. 
Module Positions 
Here the display positions of the modules of a template are administered. You can define 
up to 56 different positions. You can display module content in these positions (see also 
Section 4.8). 
4.4.7 Site: Trash Manager 
The Trash Manager contains your garbage bin. It collects content and menu elements that 
you have disposed of by clicking on the trash icon, and files it under two tabs: 
 
Figure 4.41: Trash Manager 
You can retrieve items from the trash by selecting the element and clicking Restore; if 
you click Delete, it is irretrievably deleted. 
If you get involved in this, you have to know what you are doing.  
Knowledge of HTML and CSS is essential. 
4.4.8 Site: User Manager 
Users play a very special role on your Mambo site. At the moment, you are the only user 
(admin) that the Mambo administration knows. If you allow user registration on your site 
(see Section 4.4.1), presumably there will be a lot more very shortly.  
In the User Manager (illustrated in Figure 4.42), you can change, delete, block, and 
assign different rights to users. 
In the overview list you can see the real name of the user, if the user is logged in at  
the moment—symbolized by a green check mark (Logged In), if the user is activated 
(Enabled), the UserID, the Group, his or her e-mail address, and the date of his/ 
her last access to your site. This refers to their last login to your site, not login to  
Mambo administration. 
 
74 

Chapter 4 
 
Figure 4.42: User Manager 
New 
With New you can create a new user. By clicking on New you get an appropriate form 
(Figure 4.43). The following options are available for you:  
 
Figure 4.43: New 
Name: The real name of the user. 
Username: The user ID. 
E-Mail: The e-mail address. Depending on the settings in the Site | Global Configuration 
menu, an e-mail address can be used just once or several times (see Section 4.4.1). 
Password: The password has to be entered twice for verification. 
 
75

Customizing Mambo 
Group: The group affiliation is divided into two large areas: Users that are only allowed 
to visit your Public Frontend (Table 4.4) and users that are allowed in the Mambo 
administration (Public Administration) (Table 4.5). All content in Mambo can be allotted 
to these groups. 
Group 
Rights 
Registered  A registered user can log in and see some part of the site that the visitor 
cannot see. 
Author 
The author can see everything that a registered user can. An author can 
write information and modify his or her information. There is generally a 
link from the user menu for this. 
Editor 
The editor can do everything that an author can. An editor can write and 
change any information that appears in the front-end. 
Publisher 
The publisher can do everything that an editor can. A publisher can write 
information and change any information that appears in the front-end. In 
addition, a publisher can decide whether information is published or not. 
Table 4.4: Front-end User Group 
The backend user group consists of the Manager, Administrator, and Super 
Administrator: 
Group 
Rights 
Manager 
A manager can create content and can see various information 
about the system. He/she is not allowed to: 
Administer users 
Install modules and components 
Upgrade a user to super administrator or modify a super 
administrator 
Work on the menu option Site | Global Configuration 
Send a mass mailing to all users 
Change and/or install templates and language files 
Administrator 
An administrator is not allowed to: 
Upgrade a user to super administrator or modify a super 
administrator 
Work on the menu option Site | Global Configuration  
Send a mass mailing to all users 
Change and/or install templates and language files 
Super 
Administrator 
A super administrator can execute all functions in Mambo 
administration. Only a super administrator can create another super 
administrator. 
Table 4.5: Backend User Groups 
 
76 

Chapter 4 
Block User: Here you can block a user and forbid him access. 
Edit: With Edit you can modify a user. 
Delete: Delete allows you to delete a user. 
Force Logout: With Force Logout you can force the immediate logout of a user. 
Special Users: A special user is any user that has more rights than an author. At the 
moment it is not possible to create your own user groups in Mambo. The group, special 
users, is helpful in limiting content elements to this group. That can be very helpful if, for 
example, one wants to offer links to internal help files only to these special users. 
4.5 Menu: Menu Manager 
The individual menus are administered here. Mambo has four different menus in the 
sample data (main menu, other menu, top menu, and user menu).  
Each menu is coupled with a so-called module, which is administered in the Module 
Manager (see Section 4.8). The four menus are shown to you in the Menu Manager 
workspace and in the menu bar (see Figure 4.44). 
You can access the existing menus from the menu bar or by clicking the respective menu 
item icon in the Menu Manager. The editing steps are the same for all menus: 
 
Figure 4.44: Menu Manager 
 
77

Customizing Mambo 
4.5.1 Customize Existing Menu 
Go to Site | Menu Manager | mainmenu (Figure 4.45). The first published menu entry on 
this list is shown as the starting page of your site. At the moment this is the front page. 
But you can make any other element the starting page: 
 
Figure 4.45: MainMenu 
New 
We will create a new menu in the next section. 
Edit 
Here you can modify an existing menu, for example, the links. After one click on the 
name link, you get the form for modification of menu elements as shown in Figure 4.46. 
In the left area, you can set up the details and on the right the parameters. The number 
and the type of parameters depends on the type of the menu entry: 
 
78 

Chapter 4 
  
Figure 4.46: Edit Menu 
Details 
Name: This is the name of the menu that appears on your site. 
Component: With this, you find out what type of content is hidden behind the menu 
entry. This setting is specified while creating the menu entry. In our case, the web links 
component is being addressed. 
Url: This is the call of the components, that is, the part behind the domain with which you 
access your site. Here, this is index.php?option=com_weblinks&Itemid=23.
 
79

Customizing Mambo 
Parent Item: The parent item is the superordinate element to this menu. Top means at the 
top level, all other entries represent existing menu entries. If, for example, you arrange 
and store Links under News, the display in the Menu Manager (Figure 4.47) and the 
display on your site changes. On the site, the menu entry Links has now slipped into 
News. You first have to click News, in order to see the Links entry.  
This way your site can be structured like a directory tree, very simply and effectively as 
shown in Figure 4.47: 
 
Figure 4.47: Tree Structures in Menu Manager 
Ordering: By clicking on the upward and downward pointing triangles you can modify 
the sort sequence within the menu. In the Ordering field you can do this in a listing. That 
way you don't have to keep clicking on the triangles. 
 
Figure 4.48: Tree Structures on the Site  
Access Level: You can decide whether this menu is to be made available to all visitors 
(Public), only registered users (Registered), or a special circle of users (Special). 
Published: You can publish or lock the menu here. 
Parameters 
Menu Image: Here you can specify a picture that must be in the root directory of the 
Media Manager (/images/stories/). Depending on the template, this picture is 
displayed on the left, next to the menu entry. 
Page Class Suffix: Here you can specify a class from the CSS file of your template, with 
which this menu entry is to be formatted. 
Back Button: Here you can assign the global settings for the back button, display it 
explicitly, or hide it. 
Page Title: With this, you can display or hide the title of the page. 
 
80

If you don't enter anything here, the name of the link is assumed. 
Table Headings: Here you can display or hide the heading above the listing. 
Hits: The hits on the links are displayed in the link list. You can change these in the 
global settings or via an appropriate selection. 
Link Descriptions: Here you can enable the description that is displayed under a link in 
the link list. 
Category List - Section/Category: If you click on Links, you can see the default text  
or your own text if specified in the parameters. Among them is a list of available 
categories and sections. This list can be turned on and off with two switches, as  
shown in Figure 4.49. 
Description: Here you can switch the general description of the link components on  
or off. 
Description Text: Here you can overwrite the standard text of the link components with 
individual text. 
Image: Here you can specify a picture, which must be in the root directory of the Media 
Manager (/images/stories/). Depending on the image align parameter, this picture is 
displayed on the left or right of the description text, as illustrated in Figure 4.50:

Image Align: This is the setting for the adjustment of the picture (see Figure 4.50). 
Icon: This is the icon, which is displayed to the left of the list of links. 
Publish 
If you select one or more menu elements and click the publish icon, they are published. 
Unpublish 
If you click Unpublish, marked entries are no longer displayed on the site. 
Move 
This entails moving of menu entries. Select one or several menu elements and click 
Move. This opens a form, listing the available menus (Figure 4.51). Select the menu into 
which you would like to move the marked menu entries: 
 
Figure 4.51: Move Menu  
Copy 
In order to copy menu entries, select one or several menu elements and click Copy. A 
form is opened, listing the available menus. Select the menu into which you want to copy 
the marked menu entries. 
Trash 
In order to throw menu entries into the wastepaper basket, select one or several menu 
elements and click on the trash icon. The marked menu entries are then dumped into the 
trash can. 
4.5.2 Create a new Menu 
Let's create a new menu with the name Mambobook and a link to http://www.google. 
co.in/. Go to Menu | Menu Manager | New:

Menu Name: The name of the menu. This name does not show up on the site, it only 
serves to make a connection between module and menu. 
Module Title: The name of the module. Type the word Search into both fields. After 
clicking Save, Mambo produces a new module with the given name (Figure 4.53): 
 
Figure 4.53: Menu in the Menu Manager  
Now click the menu items icon or call up Site | Menu Manager | Mambobook in the menu 
bar. You will see the overview mask about the content of the menu mambobook. Since 
no content is there yet, click New.  
You can now select content from four different areas from the selection mask that 
appears on your screen (Figure 4.54).

Figure 4.54: New Menu Item  
Content 
Content is divided into blogs, links, and tables. A blog, in the Mambo sense, is a list of 
entries with a hook and a read more link. A link refers directly to a certain piece of 
content. A table is a list of links. A section is a grouping element. Within a section there 
can be categories. You can find the meaning of the options in table 4.6: 
Option 
Relevance 
Blog – Content Category 
Blog page that relates to a category (e.g. latest news). 
Blog – Content Category 
Archive Blog page that relates to archived categories (no 
entries as of yet). 
Blog – Content Section  
Blog page that relates to a section (e.g. news). 
Blog – Content Section 
Archive 
Blog page that relates to archived sections (no entries as

Link – Content Item 
Link to a content element (e.g. Sample News Item 2). 
Link – Static Content 
Direct link to a static content page. There is a static 
content page in the sample data (
 
Mambo License

Figure 4.58: Content Organized by Mambo 
This structure can be compared with the directory tree on your hard drive. You can create 
as many sections, categories, and as much static content as you desire. If you archive 
individual elements, then the structure is completely transferred to the archive. The 
content menu makes different workspaces available, in order to work on content and 
structures (Figure 4.59):

4.6.1 Content by Section 
Content is sorted according to section. The next step in the structure is Category; the 
actual content then follows (Items). 
Section 
Underneath the Content by Section menu, all available sections are shown. You can add 
as many sections as you want. 
Category  
Underneath each section you again find a listing of the existing categories, as well as the 
option to work on these categories. 
Add/Edit Section Category 
Here you can create a new category, by clicking New. Let us use the category 
Mambobook as an example.  
Category Title: The title of the category that appears in the title line of the browser. 
Category Name: The name of the category that will be displayed on the site. 
Section: The section in which the category is to be created, in our case, The News
 
. 
Image: Here you can select a picture that will be displayed when the site is accessed. The 
picture has to be in the Media Manager root directory (/images/stories/). I have 
selected 
 articles. 
.jpg
Image Position: Here you can select the orientation of the picture. 
Ordering: Here the order of the category is determined. In this case it is a new element, 
which by default is integrated at the end. The sequence can be changed after it has been 
saved once. 
Access Level: Who has access to this element? 
Published: Should the category be published immediately? 
Description: This is the description of the category. If you selected the WYSIWYG editor 
in Site | Global Configuration | Site (Section 4.4.1), a basic word processor will pop up:

Figure 4.66: Content Items Manager 
 
93

Customizing Mambo 
The Content Manager is the central configuration station for all types of content. You can 
filter the displayed content by section (area), category, and author in three option lists in 
the information area. In addition, you will find a search field, with which you can search 
the titles. 
In the lower part is the navigation bar, with whose assistance you can leaf through the 
contents. In the option list, you can select the number of entries you want to see. The 
setting that you entered in Site | Global Configuration | Site acts as the default. The list is 
sorted by section, category, author, and title. 
There is a check box in front of the title, with which you can select those elements that 
you want to work on. If you select the check box in front of the headline, all elements of 
the list are selected. 
The Title is a link to the edit mode for Content Items (Figure 4.62). 
Published indicates whether the entry is published (green check mark) or not (red cross). 
Besides these two symbols, the possibility also exists that the publication period has run 
out and the element is stored in archives. 
Frontpage indicates whether the entry is published on the front page (see Section 4.6.6) 
(green check mark) or not (red cross). 
With Reorder you can move the entries within a section by clicking the blue arrows. 
With Order you can execute this sorting by input of a number. 
With Access you see green public links. By clicking one of these links you can change 
the access rights between the three groups: Public, Registered, and Special. In addition 
there are also symbols for pending (waiting status) and expired (out of date). 
ID is the record number in the MySQL table. This ID will show up again in the URL  
for this entry. 
Section is the area to which this entry is assigned. You wind up in the section manager  
if you click this link. 
Category is the category in which this entry is classified. Clicking the link takes you to 
the Category Manager. 
Author is the author of the entry. Click this link and you end up in the User Manager. 
Date is the creation date of the entry. 
4.6.3 Static Content Manager 
The Static Content Manager looks like the Content Manager. However, it does not have 
any fields for sections and categories. 
 
94 

Chapter 4 
Static content means something similar to a static HTML page. Normally, content 
elements and items of information are created and sorted into categories and sections 
within Mambo. The content elements have a dynamic character, since they are usually 
displayed in a chronological order: 
 
Figure 4.67: Static Content Manager 
Static content is fixed and refers to content that rarely changes and that has no 
chronological connection to other content elements. You can find a sample of static 
content in the sample data, e.g. the license guidelines for using Mambo (Mambo  
Licence Guidelines).  
Click New and we'll run an example through the Static Content Manager by creating  
your imprint. 
You will see an input mask, just like in Figure 4.68. This time, however, there will be a 
text field. Enter imprint as title or alias title and enter your address as text. Click Apply. 
Publishing 
Parameters that have to do with publishing are defined with this. 
State: Current status (currently published). 
Published: Check box to change the status. 
Access Level: Access rights for the three user groups. 
Author Alias: Here you can enter a pseudonym for the author. 
Change Creator: Here you can change the creator of the information. 
 
95

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.68: Publishing  
Override Created Date: At this point you can change the creation date of the item. 
Clicking on the three dots will get the graphic calendar to help you with the input of 
dates, as shown in Figure 4.69. 
Start Publishing: This serves to specify the start date of the publication. By default, 
content is published immediately. By clicking the three dots, a graphic calendar is 
displayed for input assistance (as shown in Figure 4.69). 
Finish Publishing: Here you can determine the expiration date of the content. The default 
is that content is never purged. Click the three dots to call up the graphic calendar again 
(as shown in Figure 4.69):

Figure 4.71: Images 
You can assign any picture from the Media Manager to any piece of content. If it is 
available yet in the Media Manager, you can upload it while working on the content by 
clicking Upload: 
 
97

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.70: Upload  
You cannot, however, indicate a target subdirectory for this type of file upload. Select a 
subdirectory and click on a picture as shown. You will see a preview of the picture on the 
right side and now you just have to click Add. In the window below it, you can now see 
the filename:  
 
Figure 4.72: Mapping a Picture into the Text 
If you click on it, the picture preview appears. You can assign as many image files as you 
wish. You still have to specify the position in the text, where the picture is to be 
displayed. To do that, you need a Mambot with the name {mosimage}.  
Refer to Section 4.9 for more information about Mambots. Position the cursor at the 
position where the picture is to appear. Either type {mosimage} manually or click the 
Mambo logo with the I under the text window. You have to insert one Mambot for every 
picture that you want to insert. Beside the I-logo there is also a P-logo. 
 
98 

Chapter 4 
This is a Mambot that represents a page break {mospagebreak}. If you have text that you 
want to distribute over several pages, you have to insert this Mambot. 
For the display on the site, Mambo automatically produces a navigation bar to help you 
scroll through the content:

In Section Manager you can work on the sections. In the overview table, the information 
that you already know from the other lists is displayed, but in this case it is expanded to 
the number of total categories contained—how many are active and how many are in the 
trash can (Figure 4.78): 
 
Figure 4.78: Section Manager

4.6.5 Category Manager 
In the Category Manager you can work on categories. Here you will also see familiar 
information in the overview table: how many of the categories are active, and how many 
are in the trash can (Figure 4.79): 
 
Figure 4.79: Category Manager 
4.6.6 Frontpage Manager 
The Frontpage Manager has a special task. The frontpage is the title page of your 
website. Selected content is here represented in blog form. Blog form means the 
representation of several pieces of information with its introduction text and a Read More 
link in several columns. You can select your content for the frontpage from all of the 
content, regardless of category and section. Whether content appears on the frontpage is 
specified by you in the Content Manager.  
 
Figure 4.80: Frontpage Manager 
The Frontpage Manager as illustrated above has the same structure as the Content Items 
Manager (Figure 4.66). You can also sort the individual content items within the 
Frontpage Manager. 
 
102 

Chapter 4 
4.6.7 Archive Manager 
The idea of archives is to not delete outdated content, but to preserve it for posterity: 
 
Figure 4.81: Archive Manager 
Laid out like the Content Items Manager (Figure 4.66), the Archive Manager (Figure 
4.81) collects all content that is archived by clicking the archive icon. 
Archives can be displayed by the Menu Manager in, for example, a new archives menu. 
In addition, there are the following possibilities, as has been illustrated in Figure 4.54: 
Blog – Content Category Archive: Display of a particular archive category 
Blog – Content Section Archive: Display of a section 
4.7 Components Menu 
In software development, a component or a Java Bean means a program that contains 
business logic, is accessible through defined interfaces, and sometimes also has a user 
interface. Imagine a simple component acting like a so-called black box: I put something 
in the front and something comes out the back: I don't have to know what happens inside. 
What matters is that I can use the black box for completely different purposes. 
Components can be designed very generally and bundled into handy packages. This idea 
of a software component is similar in Mambo. Business logic, such as banner 
administration or a forum, is written generally and in Mambo works in concert with all 
the templates and Mambo administration. 
4.7.1 Install/Uninstall 
Anyone can write a component, package it according to certain rules, and install it as per 
Mambo installation into his or her Mambo system: 
 103

Customizing Mambo 
 
Figure 4.82: Install/Uninstall 
The installation, as with the language files, is executed either by file or FTP upload of the 
component package. 
The necessary database tables are created during the installation. The installation fields 
indicate whether the necessary directories for the installation, media/administrator/ 
components/, components/, and images/stories/ are provided with write rights. 
Installed Components 
In the Installed Components workspace, you can see a list of components installed  
by default. 
Currently Installed: Name of the components. 
Component Menu Link: Necessary parameter in the URL, in order to access the 
component. Only components addressable from the homepage need this link. 
Author: The author of the component. 
Version: The component version. 
Date: The creation date. 
 
104 

Chapter 4 
Author E-Mail: E-mail of the author. 
Author Url: Homepage of the author. 
4.7.2 Banner 
The banner component makes the display of advertising banners on your site possible. 
Banner switching with Mambo is accounted for, on the basis of bought banner 
impressions. Each time your site is accessed, another banner is displayed. Every display 
counts as an impression. The banner is clickable and links to the site of the customer. 
The banner component offers customer and banner administration. By default, the so-
called full banner is sent. A full banner is 468 x 60 pixels large and should not 
substantially exceed 20 KB in file size. The format is .gif, .jpg, or .png. 
Let's walk through a banner switch. Create or copy a banner with the dimensions of 468 x 
60 pixels as shown: 
 
Figure 4.83: Test banner  
Manage Clients 
Before you can switch a banner, you need a customer. If you click Components |  
Banner | Manage Clients | New, you are opening a new customer account. Store it  
by clicking Save.  
The Banner Client Manager, where you wind up, now displays your new customer as 
well as the number of active banners of this customer: 
 
Figure 4.84: New Client 
 105

Customizing Mambo 
Manage Banners 
In order to be able to assign a banner to the customer, click on Components | Banners | 
Manage Banners. You can see the Banner Manager, which gives you an overview of the 
existing banners as shown: 
 
Figure 4.85: Banner Manager 
Banner Name: Name of the banner 
Published: Whether the banner is published or not 
Impressions Made: Number of impressions to date 
Impressions Left: Number of remaining impressions 
Clicks: Clicks on the banner 
% Clicks: Proportion of impressions to clicks 
In order to switch to a new banner, you first click on the upload icon. A small upload 
window opens for uploading banners. The banners don't emerge in the Media Manager, 
but are stored in the directory /image/banner/. If you want to delete a banner again, that 
can only be done currently by a FTP client. After you have uploaded the banner, click 
New and fill out the banner as shown in Figure 4.86: 
Banner Name: Give the banner a meaningful name so that you will recognize it in the 
Banner Manager. 
Client Name: Select the client from the list of current clients. 
Impressions Purchased: Enter the number of purchased impressions or check the 
Unlimited box. 
Banner URL: Select the just-uploaded banner from the list of the existing banners. After 
the selection, you will see a preview of the banner in the lower area. 
Show Banner: Should the banner be published? 
Click URL: Enter the URL of the site to which the banner is supposed to be linking.

4.7.3 Contacts 
It is often difficult for a customer surfing your site to contact you. Many employees 
normally work in different departments in companies and often only one address (for 
example, info@company.com) is shown on the homepage or on a form and the customer 
has no idea who receives it.  
To avoid this, Mambo makes it possible to specify contact categories. You can register 
contact persons for your company. Mambo then produces a contact form for every 
coworker on the site. 
Manage Contacts 
Click Components | Contacts | Manage Contacts. You will see the Contact Manager and 
a contact from the sample data as shown:  
 
Figure 4.88: Contact Manager 
Mark the sample contact and click Unpublish. You can create a new contact with New as 
shown in Figure 4.89.  
Category: Select the contact category here. At the moment, the sample category Contacts 
is available. 
Linked to User: With this option you can connect a contact with a user account. Since I 
have already created an account for myself, I can now select it.  
You can populate the remaining fields with the appropriate address data and add some 
text as miscellaneous information. In order to store it, click on the save icon: 
 
108 

Chapter 4 
 
Figure 4.89: New Contact 
Since we did not publish the sample entry, there is currently only one contact in the 
system. There is no necessity to show categories. Because of this, the contact link 
branches immediately to that one entry. If you publish the sample entry again, the 
following window pops up: 
 
Figure 4.90: Contact Category List  
The existing contact categories are displayed here. After clicking on the category, you get 
a table with the existing contacts:

illustrated in Figure 4.93) you can specify the default contact (Site Default).  
In addition, you can specify the publication, ordering, and access rights:

Under Images, as shown in Figure 4.94 you can assign a picture to each contact. 
Photograph your staff and let your customers know what the guy they are writing  
to looks like: 
 
Figure 4.94: Images 
Under Parameters, the contact form can finally be completely individualized. You can 
even change the icons next to the telephone numbers. The available icons are in the 
subdirectory /images/M_images/and cannot be accessed via the Media Manager. 
Contacts Categories 
In the Category Manager for contacts, you can create new categories and modify existing 
ones:

Delight your users with mass mail! As cynical as this sentence sounds, in the age of 
massive spam e-mailing, mass mailing is the best way of contacting one's registered 
users. The Mass Mail component gives you the tool to do it. 
Group: Here you can select the user group that the mass mailing is to be addressed to. 
Mail to Child Groups: If you put a checkmark here, the subgroups of the selected user 
groups are also addressed. 
Send in HTML mode: Check this if you want to send the mass mail in HTML format. 
HTML mail is becoming more and more popular. You should, however, keep in mind 
that many e-mail clients can switch the HTML display off. For different reasons, some 
users may not even like HTML mail.

Subject: This is the subject of your e-mail. 
Message: This is the actual text. 
 
Figure 4.97: Mass Mail 
For mass mailing, set the mail settings in Site | Global Configuration | Mail correctly.  
If you want to send a mass mail from your local environment, but are not running a  
mail server, then you can also register the SMTP server of your mail provider in the  
mass mail settings. 
4.7.5 News Feeds 
News feeds are a terrific thing. The ever-growing information abundance on the Internet 
makes it necessary to test effective organizational methods. If you regularly have to visit 
twenty web pages to check what's new, it takes up too much time. With fifty or hundred it 
is absolutely hopeless to try to keep an overview. News feeds are an attempt to solve this 
problem. What they are and how they are produced is covered in Section 4.7.7. 
With the news feed component you can merge feeds from other pages into your pages. To 
do that, a Category Manager and a Content Manager are at your disposal. The sample 
data already has several categories and numerous news feeds incorporated. Integrate your 
own news feed. You can use a search engine for this purpose or look for the small XML 
button at the sites that you visit. 
Manage Newsfeeds 
A click on Components | News Feeds | Manage New Feeds | New allows you to fill in 
your preferences:

Number of Articles: This refers to the number of articles that are to be merged. 
Cache time (in seconds): How long should the break between the actualizations be  
(in seconds)? 
Ordering: This is the sequence new news feeds will start at, by default. The sequence can 
be changed after it has been saved once. 
Published: Should it be published immediately? 
Your new news feed, as long as you have Internet access, is displayed on your site:

Chapter 4 
Since there are differences between the character sets of individual languages, there may 
be problems in the display of special characters and HTML commands. This is dependent 
on many factors. It depends, for example, on whether the special characters were 
produced with Unicode or with a regional character set. By the way, the operator of the 
news feed should not insert HTML commands. On the other hand, the Mambo function 
should also be improved when it comes to the presentation. Just try it out. The result is 
not exactly predictable. 
Manage Categories 
Here you can administer the news feed categories. The administration functions are 
similar to the Contacts Category Manager shown in Figure 4.95. 
4.7.6 Polls 
The integrated poll module makes it possible for you to publish polls on your site. One 
poll is already included in the sample data as illustrated below: 
 
Figure 4.100: Edit Polls 
Title: This is the title of your poll. 
Lag: This determines the time in seconds that has to elapse before another selection can 
be made. This lag offers some kind of protection from the falsification of survey data. 
Options: Here you can enter up to twelve answer options. 
Show on menu items: You can select in which area of the site the poll is to be displayed. 
Multiple options are possible by holding down the Control key and clicking the left 
mouse button.

Click Preview to get a preview of your poll. To display it on your site, make sure that 
polls are provided in the current template. Now see the poll on your site:

The poll itself is no longer displayed, since by default it was attached only to the front 
page. Attaching the poll to the individual pages can be configured in the Module 
Manager (see Section 4.8.2). 
4.7.7 Syndicates 
In the syndicate component, parameters for producing news feeds can be specified. 
A news feed is an XML file that adheres to current standards (Listing 4.1). You can 
create this file by clicking the RSS 0.91 option on your site, as illustrated: 
 
Figure 4.103: Syndication of  
News Feeds  
This file is not intended to be read, but serves as an exchange format between two 
programs. 
Normally one doesn't transfer the file, but only hands over the appropriate URL: 
http://localhost/mambo/index2.php?option=com_rss&feed=RSS0.91&no_html=1
The file creation and the visual preparation are handled by the reading program.

4.7.8 Weblinks 
Here you create a link list that you can integrate into your site. Mambo offers categories 
and counts the hits on the links. In the user menu, you can let your registered users 
suggest links that should be included in this list. These suggested links wind up in the 
weblinks items list and still have to be published. 
Weblink Items 
You can enter individual links here as shown: 
Name: Name of the link that is displayed on the site. 
Category: Selection of an available link category. 
URL: The URL of the link. 
Description: Here you can enter a detailed description of the link.

4.8 Module Menu 
A module is simpler than a component. It is a code fragment or a snippet that is inserted 
and interpreted by another part of the program. 
Because of the capabilities of the PHP script language, modules can collect data from all 
kinds of sources. This could be a source on your own site—say, the last five articles, or 
the weather, foreign exchange rate, Amazon, or an e-bay web service. 
A module contains business logic and a user interface. Unlike most components, it does 
not have its own administration area. The template of your site calls and starts the 
different modules directly. 
Since the modules are independent programs, they can perform something particular in 
this area of the template, for example, display a banner. A template doesn't do anything, 
but groups many different modules in a visually appealing way. The module structure has 
an advantage because you can easily expand your site. 
 121

Customizing Mambo 
Since you can use templates for your site and for Mambo administration, there are also 
various modules for these templates. 
4.8.1 Install/Uninstall 
Here you can install file packages for modules by file upload or from a directory:  
 
Figure 4.109: Install/Uninstall Modules 
For uninstalling, select the module and click Delete. Below the installation area, you can 
see a list of the installed modules with the origin of the modules and other information. 
4.8.2 Site Modules 
The Module Manager is the central place for the administration of modules: 
 
Figure 4.110: Site Modules 
Module Name: This is the name of the module and heading on the site. 
Published: Is the module published? 
 
122 

Chapter 4 
Reorder: Here, with help of the blue arrows, you can change the order. With this you can 
determine, for example, whether the search menu should be displayed above or below the 
main menu. 
Order: Direct ordering, by specifying the position and a single click on the icon next to 
Order can spare you excessive clicking of the blue arrows. 
Access: This refers to the access rights for this module (Public, Registered, and Special). 
Position: The position is a specification for the template, where the display of this module 
is intended. There are eight positions within a template. 
• 
Banner (advertising area) 
• 
Left (left page ) 
• 
Right (right side) 
• 
Top  
• 
user1 (user defined 1) 
• 
user2 (user defined 2) 
• 
user3 (user defined 3) 
• 
user4 (user defined 4) 
After these positions, you can filter the message for a better overview with the help of the 
list in the upper area. 
Pages: Is the module shown on all or only designated pages? 
ID: The record number from the database 
Type: There are different types of modules. The type mod_mainmenu, for example, 
appears several times, since every menu belongs to this type. The individual menus differ 
only in the parameters.  
In order to have a better overview, you can filter the information by these types with the 
help of the option list within the upper area. 
In addition, there is still another filter field with which you can filter the information by 
search words. These filter mechanisms are quite meaningful and Mambo comes packaged 
with 21 of these modules as standard. 
These modules, to a large extent, function uniformly. Besides the input for name, you 
also have to decide on which pages your module is displayed and what position the 
module takes up in the template. The parameter list is particularly important with 
modules; therefore I will particularly emphasize parameters during further demonstration 
of the modules. 
 123

Customizing Mambo 
Banner 
This module controls the display of banners. You can use the record member-ID of the 
customer (banner client) as a parameter and thereby make sure that only banners of this 
customer are displayed. In addition, you can assign a CSS class to this name. In this case, 
it would have to be an addition to the class table, for example, table.moduletable. 
This enables an individual organization of the module (module class suffix). 
Template Chooser 
This module allows the visitor to the page to select from various templates. By default, it 
is deactivated and assigned to the site: 
 
Figure 4.111: Template  
Chooser Module 
The parameters for this module are: 
Max. Name Length: This is the length of the template name in characters, which is shown 
in the option list. If the name is longer, three dots are attached. 
Show Preview: Should the template preview be switched on or off? 
Width/Height: This is the width and height of the preview picture in pixels. 
Module Class Suffix: Specify the name of a CSS class here. It has to be an addition to  
the class table, for example, table.moduletable. Thus you can configure the module 
individually. 
All Menus (mod_mainmenu) 
The module mod_mainmenu is used for all menus. There are vertical (main menu) and 
horizontal menus (top menu). With vertical menus, the option of a flatlist is offered. A 
flatlist is simply an enumeration of individual points. 
Menu Class Suffix: Here you can enter a special CSS class for the visual organization of 
the menu. 
Module Class Suffix: Here you specify a special CSS class for the visual organization of 
the module (menu content). 
 
124 

Chapter 4 
Menu Name: This is the name of the menu. 
Menu Style: Should it be vertical, horizontal, or flatlist? 
Enable Cache: Should the content of the menu be cached in order to reduce load time? 
Show Menu Icons: Should menu icons be displayed? The format of the icons depends on 
the respective active template. 
Menu Icon Alignment: Should the menu icons be positioned in the left or right? 
Expand Menu: Should the menu entry always be expanded, even if one clicks on another 
entry? This function is only meaningful with interlocked menu structures: 
 
Figure 4.112: Menu Nesting 
Indent Image: Which icon is to be represented with the sub-structures of a menu entry? 
You may take the icons from the template, use the Mambo default values, provide each 
hierarchical level with its own picture, or not use any icons. 
Indent Image 1-6: You can define icons for six hierarchical levels here. 
Spacer: With horizontal menus, a separator (which you determine here), should be placed 
between menu entries. 
End Spacer: With horizontal menus an end-character can be shown at the end of menu 
entries. If you want that, specify it here. 
Login Form 
The login module makes two different views available. If one is not yet logged in, one 
gets a login form: 
 125

Customizing Mambo 
Depending on the settings in Site | Global Configuration | Site, it's possible to  
register again: 
 
Figure 4.113: Login Module 
After successful authentication, the display changes to the logout option: 
 
Figure 4.114: Logout Module  
The parameters of the Login Form include:  
Module Class Suffix: Here you can enter a special CSS class for the visual organization of 
the menu. 
Pre-text: Text that you enter here appears before the form in the login mode. 
Post-text: Text that you enter here appears at the end of the module in the login mode. 
Login Redirection URL: Here you can determine the URL to which the user is forwarded 
after a successful login. 
Logout Redirection URL: Here you specify the URL to which the user is sent after a 
successful logout. 
Login Message: Should a message in a JavaScript box be displayed after a  
successful login? 
Logout Message: Should a message in a JavaScript box be displayed after a  
successful logout? 
Greeting: After login, the module changes its appearance and displays a greeting text  
and a logout button. Here can you decide whether you want this text to read: 
 ("hello, username"). 
Name/Username: Here you determine whether the user is addressed with his/her real 
name or with his/her username in the greeting text. 
 
126 

Chapter 4 
Syndicate 
In the syndicate module, different news feeds are offered as shown in Figure 4.103. 
You can specify in the parameters which standards you are offering and whether you 
want to use standard pictures or individual pictures. The content of the news feeds 
offered is given by the entries on the front page. 
Statistics 
The statistics module is deactivated by default. If you activate it, you must still select the 
pages on which the statistics are to be displayed. The module supplies information about 
your server and its site: 
 
Figure 4.115: Statistics Module 
The parameters of the Statistics module are: 
Server Info: Should the server information be displayed or not? 
Site Info: Should the site information be displayed or not? 
Hit Counter: Should the visitor counter be integrated or not? 
Increase Counter: Here you can specify the initial value of the visitor counter. 
Archive 
The Archive module, by default, is deactivated. If you activate it, you must select the 
pages on which it is to be displayed.  
It supplies information about the contents of your archive (Figure 4.116). The display is 
grouped by month:

The Sections module is deactivated by default. If you activate it, you must select the 
pages on which it is to be displayed. It lists the existing sections (Figure 4.117): 
 
Figure 4.117: Sections  
Module 
Related Items 
The Related Items module indicates other content that is related to this content. 
The relationship is based on the keywords specified in the metadata. All keywords of 
recently displayed content are compared with those of other published content. 
If, for example, you register the keyword "law" in the Mambo License Guidelines in the 
static pages and also in your created imprint, the license guidelines are shown as a related 
item when you request the imprint: 
 
Figure 4.118: Related  
Item Module 
Wrapper 
The Wrapper module wraps external content that is not produced by Mambo, within a so-
called iframe. An iframe is an HTML tag and represents a scrollable area within a web 
page (Figure 4.119): 
 
Figure 4.119: Wrapper- 
bound page 
With the help of this module you can integrate complete pre-existing HTML pages from 
other servers into the content area of Mambo. 
 
128 

Chapter 4 
The parameters for this module are: 
URL: Here you can specify a standard URL. The specification of the page that is to be 
shown, however, usually takes place in the menu allocation (Figure 4.55). 
Scroll Bars: Should scrollbars be shown in the iframe? You have a choice between yes, 
no, and automatic integration, if necessary. 
Width/Height: Width and height of the iframe in percentage or pixels can be specified. 
Auto Height: Should the height be automatically adjusted? 
Auto Add: By default, an http:// is inserted before an URL, if no http:// or https:// 
is found. This function can be turned on and off here. 
Polls 
Here the functionality for the display of polls is switched on or off. The polls themselves 
are configured in the polls component (see Section 4.7.6). You can decide here whether 
the content of the module should be cached or not. 
Who's Online 
The Who's Online module indicates who is currently on the site. A distinction is made 
between guests and registered users: 
 
Figure 4.120: Who's

display pictures from listing A and a second module pictures from listing B. In such a 
case, you simply select the random images module by marking the check box before the 
name and click Copy. 
A new module with the name of Copy of Random Image appears in the list. Change the 
settings as you desire and you have a new module:

4.9 Mambots Menu 
Bot is a short form for the word robot. A Mambot thus is a kind of Mambo robot. One 
can compare Mambots with a Mambo-specific script language. When we inserted 
pictures into content elements, we already came into contact with four built-in Mambots.  
Mambots are always of a certain type. For example, in order to position the picture in the 
content element, you wrote {mosimage} in the text. This calls the mos_image Mambot 
during the representation of the page, which ensures that the assigned picture is shown. 
 
134 

Chapter 4 
4.9.1 Install New Mambots 
New Mambots are installed in exactly the same manner as components, templates, and 
language files, via the menu option Mambots | Install Mambots—either by uploading or 
via directory installation. 
4.9.2 Site Mambots 
In the Mambot Manager, you will find nine Content, four Editor, and six Search 
Mambots: 
 
Figure 4.129: Site Mambots 
Mambots have few to no changeable settings, since they are mostly programmed and 
optimized for a very special purpose. 
MOS Image (content): This Mambot displays the picture in the content elements on the 
site with the command {mosimage} (see Section 4.6.3). 
Legacy Mambot (content): The Legacy Mambot offers support for older Mambots from 
version 4.5 onwards. 
Code Support (content): The Code Support Mambot formats source code; thus content 
elements that contain source code can be formatted, with the command {moscode}. 
Listing 4.2: Deployment of the moscode Mambot 
<code>{moscode} 
if ($number > 0){ 
echo $number;

Customizing Mambo 
SEF (content): SEF stands for Search Engine Friendly
 
-
. This Mambot produces the 
search engine-friendly URLs for content elements. If you use the associated feature, this 
Mambot must be activated. 
MOS Rating (content): This is the Mambot that provides the evaluation bar about the 
content. If you want to use this, it must be activated. 
E-mail Cloaking (content): This Mambot changes an e-mail address that you have entered 
into a content element in the form of hagen@sit2000.de: 
<a href=mailto:hagen@sit2000.de> hagen@sit2000.de</a> 
GeSHi (content): The GeSHi Mambot formats source code like moscode. GeSHI, 
however, understands syntax highlighting and provides impressive listings on the site, if 
you merge the source code to be formatted into < pre > </pre > HTML tags. The GeSHi 
Mambot, which structures and colors the code, therefore highlights the source code: 
 
Figure 4.130: With GeSHi- 
formatted Source Code 
Listing 4.3: Deployment of the GeSHi Mambot  
<pre> 
if ($number > 0){ 
echo $number; 
} else{ 
$number++; 
} 
</pre> 
Load Module (content): The Load Module Mambot makes it possible to load modules 
within content. It is called with {mosloadposition user1}, for example. 
MOS Pagination (content): The MOS Pagination Mambot takes care of page breaks in 
content elements. It is simply inserted into content in the same way as the MOS Images 
Mambot. Besides a simple word wrap, you can also define various headings and lemmas. 
Syntax: 
{mospagebreak} 
{mospagebreak title=page title} 
{mospagebreak heading=first page} 
{mospagebreak title=page title titleheading=first page} 
{mospagebreak heading=first page title=page title} 
 
136 

Chapter 4 
No WYSIWYG Editor/TinyMCE WYSIWYG Editor (Editor): You can control the activation 
of these two Mambots via Site | Global Configuration. Thus the WYSIWYG editor is 
activated in many description texts. 
MOS Image Editor Button/MOS Pagebreak Editor Button (Editor-XTD): These two 
Mambots generate the two buttons below the editor. By clicking on these buttons, a 
{mosimage} or a {mospagebreak} is inserted into the text. 
Search Mambots 
The Search Mambots for content, web links, contacts, categories, sections, and news 
feeds can be activated as needed. They influence the behavior of the search module.

Customizing Mambo 
4.11 Messages Menu 
The messages menu manages administrator messages. Mambo has a small 
communication network that enables sending of messages within the administrators 
group. In addition, system messages are also delivered; for example, if someone has 
posted a new content element. 
4.11.1 Inbox 
The messages are collected for you here. By clicking the new icon, you can send a new 
message to users who are permitted access to Mambo administration. 
4.11.2 Configuration 
Here you can configure the communication system. 
Lock Inbox: You can lock your mailbox and thus suppress the receipt of messages. This is 
OK if you are the only administrator; otherwise you should leave your inbox open. 
Mail me a new Message: This feature is really useful. Mambo sends the messages to the 
e-mail address given in the user administration. 
4.12 System Menu 
The system menu consists of only one element. This is a global checking-in of all content 
elements in process. 
4.12.1 Global Check-In 
If an entitled user calls up the editing mode of a content element, then this element is 
checked out. Only the entitled user may work on this element. During processing, other 
users will see a lock icon in front of the name of the element. If the document is stored 
after the change, it is then automatically checked in again and the lock icon disappears. 
If the user closes his or her browser window, or if there is a sudden break in their Internet 
connection, the element remains checked out and cannot be changed any more. 
Here the Global Check-In comes into play. By clicking this menu option, all elements in 
process are checked in and you receive an appropriate list of the elements: 
 
138 

Chapter 4 
 
Figure 4.132: Global Check-in 
The disadvantage of global checking-in is the fact that all elements get checked in. If 
someone is just about to change something, this element is also checked in and someone 
else can also change it. Be careful with this function and pay attention to who is online. 
Now that we know how to customize Mambo to our specific needs, we can concentrate 
on extending our website using a wide range of Mambo extensions.

Useful Extensions 
We have reached the almost inexhaustible range of Mambo extensions. As beautiful as 
the standard version is, soon you will be searching for components, modules, and 
Mambots with which you can extend your website. Due to the modular structure of 
Mambo, it is easy to create extensions. The following are six popular extensions: 
• 
A forum 
• 
A calendar 
• 
A picture gallery for photographs 
• 
The ability to post comments 
• 
Creating multilingual pages 
• 
An online shop 
The website http://www.mamboforge.net contains lots of components, modules, 
Mambots, templates, and language files that you may require. 
The scope for creating additional extensions exists, but commercial extensions 
are also available. Before you buy one of these, you should carefully assess your 
requirements and check out modules suitable for your application. You can also 
take part in the further development of these modules. 
5.1 Forum 
Forums are used to display and administer a number of topics where users with common 
interests can post messages. Such a forum is called a board. A good board is the 
component from Two Shoes Mambo Factory (http://tsmf.net/) with the descriptive 
name of Simpleboard. 

Useful Extensions 
5.1.1 What can Simpleboard do? 
For non-English speaking users, the biggest problem with open-source software is that 
often no manual is provided in a local language. Due to this, there is no overview of the 
functions offered by the software. One should gain as much information about the 
software as possible, before installing it. The following functions are available for the 
different types of users: 
Simpleboard administrator functions include: 
• 
Full integration into Mambo administration. 
• 
Changing user profiles: The forum component recognizes users that have an 
account in the website. A profile is automatically created the first time the 
user visits the forum. Every user can create a forum profile by means of 
his/her user details. 
• 
Adding access rights to forums. 
• 
Editing posts and viewing previous posts of a topic. 
• 
Specifying a minimum time span between posts to secure the forum from 
flood attacks. 
• 
Forum categories for building a structure with an overview. 
• 
Customizing appearance with the CSS template editor. 
The administrator functions available directly from the forum include: 
• 
Modifying, deleting, and moving posts 
• 
Locking and unlocking topics (that is, preventing further posts to a topic) 
• 
Positioning a topic at the beginning of the topic list 
The functions for all visitors include: 
• 
Writing of posts 
• 
Use of smileys and BBCode for text formatting without knowledge of HTML  
• 
Two different views of the posts (flat or threaded)  
The functions for registered users are: 
• 
Private user profile 
• 
E-mail notifications of new posts in a topic 
• 
Creating a signature that can be automatically added to every post 
• 
Uploading files and pictures to a post

5.1.2 Installation of Simpleboard 
Download the com_simpleboard-1.0.4-beta2.zip file. Click Installer | Components in 
the menu bar. Scan your computer for the file and click Upload File & Install. The installer 
loads the package onto your server, unpacks the individual files, adds the necessary tables 
to the database, and then gives you further information: 
 
Figure 5.1: Successful Installation of the Forum Component
That's it! The component is installed when you see the Upload component – Success 
message. The database tables have been created and your Mambo administration has 
been customized accordingly. Click Continue, thank the Mambo development team for 
this wonderful installer, and thank Two Shoes Mambo Factory for their forum! In the 
Mambo administration you can see the new component—the Simpleboard forum. 
Uninstallation 
Select the component and click Uninstall. The component and data are now  
permanently deleted. 
 143

Useful Extensions 
5.1.3 Simpleboard Administration 
After installation, there is a new entry in the Components menu. Click Components | 
Simpleboard and you will see the Control Panel of your forum component. There are 
eleven icons giving quick access to the forum features: 
 
Figure 5.2: Simpleboard Control Panel  
There is a PAYPAL button on the bottom right of the Control Panel. Try to make 
a small donation if you are satisfied with the forum. A lot of work has been 
invested in such components, and programmers have to eat and pay the rent! 
They are pleased when someone acknowledges their work. 
It is possible to install a different language file in this component; the entire forum 
administration thereafter appears in the chosen language. If you choose German, for 
example, you need to upload the german-SB1.0.4-beta2.zip file and unpack it. You 
have to copy the file into the subdirectory [Mambo]/administrator/components 
/com_simpleboard/language/ by hand. Now everything depends on your installation.  
If you followed the examples in the book, you have already customized a German 
Mambo version during global configuration. Your global language file is called 
germanf.php. In order to harmonize the forum and Mambo, you also have to rename the 
forum language file to germanf.php. After renaming, you will see the forum in the 
German language. The translation to German is an unnerving mixture of German and 
 
144 

Chapter 5 
English, which really makes me wonder whether one really should translate 
administration interfaces. You be the judge! 
Simpleboard Configuration 
Here you specify the basic configuration of your Simpleboard component: 
 
Figure 5.3: Simpleboard Configuration
Descriptions of the seven tabs that run along the top of this screen are as follows: 
Basics 
Enter a Board Title and your Board Email Address. A bit like Mambo itself, you can 
disable the forum and supply an appropriate message in Forum Offline Message. 
With Board Time Offset, you can change the time base. 
In Default View type, you chose from the two possible views for forum postings (Flat  
or Threaded). 
In Enable RSS feed you can add an RSS button on the forum page. This creates an XML 
file for a news feed of the newest forum posts. 
Enter a Header so that it appears in the header area of the forum. 
Frontend 
There are four blocks of parameters for changing the 'look and feel' of the forum. You 
can stick with the standard settings, or you can enable or disable display areas, and 
specify many other useful things. 
 145

Useful Extensions 
Security 
By default, the board is set up so every visitor can read and write. Flood protection is 
disabled and a moderator is sent an e-mail whenever a new post is added. You can leave 
the default settings as they are. 
Avatars 
Avatars are small pictures that can be attached to a user and displayed alongside his or 
her posts in the forum. A library of existing pictures is available and you can make 
changes to settings related to user upload, physical size of images, and file sizes. 
Uploads 
Each user can upload a file and/or picture with each post. Both are displayed with the 
user's post. In this tab, you can adjust what exactly you want to permit. You should also 
add PDFs to the permitted file types. 
Show Ranking 
Depending on their number of posts, each user is given a particular name and picture. 
Thus, other visitors can differentiate 'beginners' from 'net-heads'. In this tab, you set up 
the names of the individual stages and the number of posts it takes to move up a rank. 
Integration 
Here you can integrate various components into Simpleboard. For example, the 
Discussion Mambot enables a comment link and adds an appropriate entry into the text of 
the content element. 
You can post a comment after opening the content elements. This comment is treated like 
a topic in a forum and you can skillfully shift discussions about content into the forum. 
Forum Administration 
Here you set up forums and forum categories. Click New and you will see a form with 
three tabs: 
 
Figure 5.4: Add Forums and Categories 
 
146 

Chapter 5 
Basics: Before setting up a forum, you have to create a category, let's say with the name 
Cafeteria, and give a basic description for it. 
Advanced: Here you specify the access rights for the category. 
Moderation: This tab does not affect categories, but is available as this form is used for 
creating categories and forums. Save the category by clicking Save and this category will 
show up as unpublished in your overview: 
 
Figure 5.5: New Category
Repeat the procedure to create another forum. Call it Tips & Tricks and enter a 
description. Select the recently created Cafeteria as the assigned category. Click Save. 
There are now two entries in your overview. Publish both by clicking Publish and the 
basic version of your forum is completed: 
Figure 5.6: Publication of a New Forum
Merge the newly created forum with the main menu, so users can get there via a link 
from your website. 
Click Menu | Main menu and then New. In the following dialog, select Component, as 
shown in Figure 5.7, and click Next. Name the new menu entry as Forum and select 
Simpleboard forum in the component list. Keep the access as Public and click Save:

Chapter 5 
If you see an error message, you'll have to modify the source code. Open the 
/components/com_simpleboard/simpleboard.php file with a text editor. In line forty-
eight, check the version number of Mambo. As you know, our Simpleboard is a beta 
version. When it was released, there was apparently no Mambo version 4.5.2, only 
Mambo 4.5.1b. 
For Mambo version 4.5.2, add the following line: 
} elseif ( $mambo_release == "4.5" && ($mambo_dev_level == "1" || 
$mambo_dev_level == "1a" || $mambo_dev_level == "2") ){ 
The value of mambo_dev_level, the version number, is the crucial item in this code. 
Since we are using version 4.5.2 there should be a 2 at the end. For version 4.5.3, you 
would add a 3. Save this file and load it on your server via FTP. 
You have now programmed using PHP. It isn't that difficult, is it? 
User Administration 
Here you can change existing user profiles. The list is still empty. Create a profile (see 
Section 5.1.4) or write a post so you'll have a few entries in the list: 
 
Figure 5.9: Simpleboard User Profile Manager
You can work on profiles by clicking the Edit User Profile icon. 
File Browser 
In the file browser, you can administer the uploaded files that users attached to the 
postings. You can delete a file (Remove Completely) or jump to the appropriate post in 
the forum (Open Message):

Uploaded Images Browser 
In the images browser, you can administer pictures that were uploaded for the posts. You 
have the same options as in the file browser (see Figure 5.10). 
Edit CSS File 
Like Mambo, the forum also contains templates. You can modify the appropriate CSS 
file from Mambo administration: 
 
Figure 5.11: Simpleboard Template CSS Editor

Chapter 5 
You can find additional templates on the Two Shoes Mambo Factory website. 
Prune Forums 
Forums exist for discussions. They are not productive when there are many topics  
but few answers. The Cut Forums function enables you to delete topics that have no 
responses. You have to select the forum and the number of days you want it to  
remain active. 
Prune User 
This function synchronizes the users of the Mambo user administration with those of the 
Simpleboard component. For example, when users are deleted in Mambo, they are also 
deleted in Simpleboard after applying this function. 
Support WebSite 
You can find various forums, downloads, and items of news about the forum component 
at the Two Shoes Mambo Factory website. 
Load Sample Data 
Clicking this button loads sample data into your forum. Sample data is always useful for 
practice. This function is only available after installation. You can also find a link to the 
sample data on the web page that appears after installation (see Figure 5.1). 
Update Database to Version 1.0.4-Beta2: 
If you have installed an older version of Simpleboard, you can update your database 
structure by clicking on this icon. As we are using the latest version of Simpleboard, we 
will get the following message:  
Simpleboard tables could not be upgraded. It appears they are already at the  
latest version. 
5.1.4 User Frontend 
Visitors can post topics when you have merged the forum with your website (see  
Section 5.1.3). 
By default, a new forum is left empty, which can be confusing for inexperienced users. 
You can start working on this new forum by posting a greeting message. The first post is 
the topic (Caption).  
The integrated editor is unfortunately not Mambo's WYSIWYG editor, but an editor 
based on Bulletin Board Code (BBCode). This code is an unofficial standard on  
web forums.

In the link bar above the forum there is a link reading flat view or threaded view. Flat 
view shows the number of replies, views, and the most recent post in one row. However, 
in threaded view, the Topics column contains hyperlinked titles that indicate the 
relationship of replies to the parent post. This overview has a tree structure, which uses 
more space, but it is easier to follow the replies to the parent post:

Naturally, there are modules available for the Simpleboard component. For example, 
there is a module that displays the last five forum postings on your website. 
Installation 
Download the mod_simpleboard5.zip file and install it by clicking Installers | Modules. 
After installation, a new module named mod_simpleboard appears in the module list. By 
clicking Modules | Site Modules, you can name the new module and determine the pages 
on which it is to be displayed. In this example, it is called 'forum posts' and is published 
on all pages on the right side of the template area. The last five forum posts are displayed 
on the web page:

5.2 Calendar 
A calendar is useful for websites where many appointments are scheduled, for instance. 
There is a popular component available for Mambo with the unspectacular name Events 
(http://events.mamboforge.net/). 
5.2.1 Installation 
Download the com_events-1.2.zip file and install it from the menu option Installers | 
Components. You will receive a message that the component has been installed:  
New demo web site for Events Calendar. Check out http://mosevents.sourceforge.net 
ATTENTION 
Please open Components :: Events :: Edit config 
and change the Admin email address! 
Then, open Components :: Events :: Manage events categories 
and set up your categories. You have to set up and publish at least one before you can 
add any event. 
This is followed by further instructions. In addition, a new component named Events 
appears in the component list. 
5.2.2 Configuration 
Click Components | Events. You will see three menu entries: Manage events, Manage 
event categories, and Events config. 
Events Config  
Here you can specify the admin's e-mail address, determine which users can post events, 
format the date and time, and customize the layout. The first tab handles the parameters 
for the component:

options for individual appointments. 
Date Format ?: Change the format of the date if required. I use a format that displays in 
the following way: Sunday, 27 March 2005. 
Use 12hr time Format: Chose between the twelve-hour and twenty-four-hour clock. 
Navigation Bar Color ?: Select the color of the navigation bar.

Manage Event Categories 
Before entering an event, you need a category. Go to Components | Manage event 
categories in the menu bar and click New: 
 
Figure 5.19: New Category of Calendar Component 
You can set up a category here. Each category has a different color so it is easier to 
recognize in the calendar. In addition, you can assign and position a picture from the 
Media Manager. You can also upload a picture on the spot just by clicking the upload 
icon. The picture is saved in the /images/stories/ subdirectory. You can add a 
description for the components using the WYSIWYG editor. After you finish editing, 
click Save to store your changes. 
Once this is done, you still have to publish the category in the Events Category Manager. 
Manage Events 
This allows you to enter your preferences. Click Components | Events | Manage events 
in the menu bar, and then click New. You will see a form with four tabs:

Publishing: It is easy to enter the dates of events. Click on the button with three dots and a 
calendar pops up. Here you can select the first and last day of the event: 
 
Figure 5.22: Select Appointment 
In addition, you can scroll through months and years by clicking on the «/» symbols. 
The Start Time and End Time has to be entered in a twelve-hour or twenty-four-hour 
format (hh:mm) depending on the settings in Event Config. 
Another convenient feature is the repeat options for appointments: 
Every day: Select this option for an event that is repeated on one other or several days. A 
new event will be entered for each of the days with the same start and end time. 
Every week: This option makes it possible to choose the day of the week on which the 
event takes place. 
Several days in one week: This option lists several events that occur on different days of 
the week. Weeks: With this option, you can repeat events based on weeks, for example, 
every two weeks.
 
160 

Chapter 5 
Month: Here you can select a day of the month for the repeat with this option. 
At the end of the month: The event is on the last day of every month as long as the last 
day falls in the period specified by the start and end date. 
Year: This option lets you select a day of the year to repeat the event. 
Help: In this tab, specifications of the event-date are explained in detail. One-day events 
that extend beyond midnight can be set up here. 
Be careful with the special case of a one-day event that ends after midnight.  
When a one-day event begins, for example, at 19:00 and ends at 3:00, the start 
and end dates must be set for the same date and for the date before midnight. 
To show a link to the calendar from the site, you have to merge the calendar component 
into the main menu. Click Menu | Main menu and New, select Component in the 
subsequent dialog, and then click Next (see Figure 5.7).  
Name the new menu as Calendar and select Events in the component list. Leave the 
access as Public and click Save. 
If you reload your website, there should be a new entry at the bottom of your main menu 
(Calendar). Clicking on it will start the new component:

clicking Installers. Select the file and click Upload File & Install button. Search Events 
shows up in the list of installed Mambots. 
Click Mambots | Site Mambots in the menu bar and publish the newly installed  
Event Mambot.

You often find pictures, sculptures, montages, and similar artistic works in a gallery. In 
principle, a gallery is a collection of images. The Internet is becoming more visually rich 
nowadays and a picture, after all, says a thousand words.
 163

Useful Extensions 
There are many areas suitable for galleries. For example, if you want to create an 
association's website, you might want to photograph your association meetings and your 
members. Why not put these pictures at the disposal of the visitors or registered users of 
your site using a gallery? 
5.3.1 Zoom Media Gallery 
Mike de Boer from Rotterdam, Netherlands, developed this component. From his website 
(http://ummagumma.nl/mikedeboer/), you can download the current version, join in 
the discussion on the forum, and check out a demo of the component. 
5.3.2 Zoom Media Gallery: Installation 
Download the com_zoom_214_RC3.zip file and install it from the menu option Installers | 
Components. A message about where the component was installed, and instructions 
about how to make it work, is displayed after installation. 
 
Figure 5.27: Installation of Zoom Gallery 
Click Continue and you will see a new component with the name zOOm Media Gallery 
Admin in the component list. 
5.3.3 Changing the Language  
By default, this component is available only in English and Dutch (Version 2.1.4 RC3).  
If you choose to have everything in your local language, you need the appropriate 
language file. Download the zoom_media_gallery_2.1.4RC3.zip file and unpack it. 
Copy the language files to [mambo]/components/com_zoom/language/ on your 
computer and henceforth your Zoom Media Gallery will speak the local language.

Chapter 5 
5.3.4 Zoom Gallery: Administration 
In the Components menu, you will find a new menu option zOOm Media Gallery Admin. 
The administration gallery consists of six icons displayed one below the other: 
 
Figure 5.28: Administration 
If you roll your mouse over the icons, a tooltip appears showing their name. 
Gallery Manager 
As is the case with all content, a certain order is necessary. For pictures, the hierarchical 
levels are called galleries. Click Gallery Manager and then New Gallery. The input form 
for a new gallery is divided into two tabs. 
Properties 
In the Properties tab, specify the properties of the gallery: 
 165

Useful Extensions 
 
Figure 5.29: Create a New Gallery 
The options available under Properties are: 
Insert after: Just like the Mambo menu entry system, you can nest galleries to your liking. 
To do this, you must select the parent gallery here. 
Hide 'no media' text: If there are no pictures in the gallery, the text no media is displayed. 
If you don't want this text, click the check box. 
Name gallery: This is the name of the gallery that will appear on the website. 
Keywords: These keywords are considered while searching. 
Description: The description you entered is shown on the gallery's page. 
Published: This is where you release the gallery. 
Members 
In the Members tab, you enter the access rights for the gallery. 
Public Access: All users of the website can access the pictures. 
Members Only: Only registered users can access the pictures. 
User Name: Only the named user can access the pictures.
 
166 

Chapter 5 
After clicking Save, you will see a message box indicating that the gallery has been 
created and you are automatically sent to the list of existing galleries. If you want to edit 
a gallery, select it via the check box and click Edit. 
Upload Files 
You can upload files in different ways. 
single (ZIP-)file: Presumably, you will first want to upload an individual file. The 
principle is always the same. File location, gallery, name, keywords, and description text 
are specified as shown in the picture: 
 
Figure 5.30: Uploading a File 
multiple files: The form for individual files is shown several times so you can upload 
several pictures at once. 
Drag n Drop: If you have the Java plug-in in your browser and/or have the Java Runtime 
Environment installed on your computer (http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/), 
you can start a Java applet with which you can transfer several files at once by clicking 
Drag n Drop: 
 167

Useful Extensions 
 
Figure 5.31: Java Applet for File Upload 
With the Java applet you can also add files using a normal file dialog or via Drag n Drop 
from your File Manager. You have to assign the same description to all pictures. 
scan directory: You can search whole directories for pictures and upload them together. 
Settings 
The settings dialog is divided into four tabs: System, Layout, Safe Mode, and 
Accessibility. 
System 
When working with pictures, issues that always crop up are size and overview. Having 
thumbnails (small picture previews) displayed a bit like a table of contents on a page has 
become standard on the Internet:  
 
168 

Chapter 5 
 
Figure 5.32: System Settings 
The advantage is that users get a rough overview of the pictures without downloading 
them. By clicking on the preview of a picture, the corresponding large version is opened. 
Depending on your server configuration, it is possible that the multiple upload 
option will not work, but soon there will be a version that can do this error-free. 
To do this, the preview pictures have to be produced automatically. It is not that simple 
and can be performed in several ways. 
The Zoom Media Gallery offers four possibilities. Two external programs, ImageMagick 
(http://www.imagemagick.org/) and NetPBM (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/) 
must be installed on the server, and two libraries, GD1 and GD2 must be compiled into 
the PHP module. Since you have no influence on the selection of the software installed 
on a rented server and both require major system resources, the first two options are just a 
matter of luck. With a local installation under Windows or Linux, you can download and 
install the programs yourself. 
The third program, the GD library (http://www.boutell.com/gd/), has the advantage 
that it is already contained in PHP. There are different versions of PHP and GD. 
 169

Useful Extensions 
Fortunately, the setup routine recognizes whether GD is the latest version and selects it 
automatically. GD has less functionality than the first two programs, but can produce 
.jpg previews. 
NetPBM and GD2 JPEG quality: Here you specify the compression ratio as a percentage.
Thumbnail max. size: Here you determine the size of the preview picture in pixels. 
Temporary Name: Here you type in a default name. 
Temporary Description: Here you can specify a standard description. 
Path to FFmpeg: ffmpeg is a command-line program that converts files from a 
video/audio or picture format into another format. It also supports recording and 
encoding from a TV card in real time. 
Path to PDFtoText: A program that converts PDF to text. 
Layout 
Here you can specify various stylistic parameters for your gallery: 
 
Figure 5.33: Layout Settings 
The parameters decide the number of thumbnails on a page and the display or lack of 
display, for example, comments, postcards, keywords, search fields, etc. 
 
170 

Chapter 5 
In addition, the Zoom Media Gallery CSS file can be customized here and a method for 
sorting the thumbnails can be selected. 
Safe Mode 
The PHP language has a "safe mode" in which certain actions, for example file write 
access, are forbidden (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/PHP/features 
.safe-mode.html). 
If safe mode is switched on, no files can be uploaded and file uploads are necessary for 
the gallery. Therefore, you can simply specify your FTP access instructions here and PHP 
then uses the built-in FTP functionality for uploading pictures. 
Accessibility 
 
Figure 5.34: Access Rights 
Here you select the default access rights by choosing yes or no in the following fields: 
• 
Allow users to create a gallery 
• 
Allow users to delete a published gallery 
• 
Allow users to modify a published gallery 
• 
Show the upload link in the user menu 
Move Media 
Here you can move pictures from one gallery into another in three steps: 
1. Select the gallery in which the picture that you want to move is located. You 
receive a form displaying pictures in this gallery with a check box adjacent to 
each picture's filename. 
2. Select the pictures to be moved by marking the appropriate check boxes. 
3. Select the target gallery. 
 171

Useful Extensions 
 
Figure 5.35: Move Media 
Optimize Tables 
This cleans the database tables used by the gallery. Occasionally such housekeeping  
may be necessary, for example, when users upload files and interrupt the process before  
it is finished. This creates entries in the database, although the matching pictures never 
got there. 
Update Zoom Media Gallery 
This link leads to Mike de Boer's website from where you can install the latest updates 
for the gallery. 
Integration of the Gallery into your Website 
Now you have to merge the gallery with the main menu so that it is displayed on your 
website. Click Menu | Main menu and then New. Select Component in the subsequent 
dialog and click Next (see Figure 5.7). 
Give a new name to the menu entry (picture gallery) and select Zoom Media Gallery 
Admin in the component list. Leave the access on Public and click Save. 
If you exit your web page and reload it, a new entry (picture gallery) is located in your 
main menu at the bottom of the page. Clicking on it will start your new component.
 
172 

Chapter 5 
Depending on your choice of settings, you will see your photo galleries with a preview of 
the pictures. Click on the gallery link to see the previews for all pictures. If you click on a 
preview picture, a new page with the original picture and the information you entered is 
opened. Below the picture, there is a space for comments. 
5.3.5 User Frontend 
Depending on the access rights set, you may create galleries and upload files. A similar 
interface to the one described in Section 5.3.4, is at your disposal. You get to this 
interface via the user system link. 
Lightbox 
Lightbox is a personal selection of pictures displayed when you click the Lightbox icon. 
You can insert individual pictures and whole galleries into the Lightbox. You can find the 
Lightbox icon above the picture. 
E-Cards 
You can send pictures and a message as an e-card to a friend's e-mail address by clicking 
the link to your card in the e-mail. You can specify the expiry date of the e-card in the 
administration settings. 
5.3.6 Modules for the Zoom Media Gallery 
There are various modules for your gallery. For example, to show random pictures, the 
last five, the most visited, those with the most comments, and even a scrolling module 
that lets you scroll random pictures. Look around Mike de Boer's site and try out a few 
modules. 
5.4 Comments 
If you prefer interactive websites and are interested in your visitors' opinions, it would be 
great for your users to be able to comment on Content Items. This is possible with Arthur 
Konze's AkoComment component. 
5.4.1 Installation 
Download the com_akocomment20.zip file and install it using the component installer:

5.5 Multilingualism with Mambelfish 
The Mambelfish component makes it possible to produce a multilingual website. This 
topic is quite complex, and using this component is not easy. In Europe, there is a 
demand for multilingual websites. Creating a real multilingual site with Mambo is not yet 
possible. You can select from many front-end language files, but the website has only one 
language. With Alex Kempkens' ingenious component, it is now possible to produce real 
multilingual websites.  
The language aspect is always difficult. A web page consists of standard sentences, 
which are translated into language files. These language files are also used in 
Mambelfish. Furthermore, a standard language is specified in Global Configuration. 
According to requirements, users can select several target languages. 
But what happens to the content? 
Here, Mambelfish takes the rocky but logical route of translating all dynamic content in 
the translation manager into an appropriate target language. They include the menu 
descriptions and different categories. The content is not translated automatically; instead, 
you have to produce every content element in the target language. 
This has the following advantages: 
• 
Every part of your website is available in all languages. 
• 
The user can see the entire website in a different language by a click  
of the mouse. 
5.5.1 Installation of Mambelfish (Component and Module) 
Download the mambelfish_1.5.zip file and install it from the menu option Installers | 
Components. After installation, you will see a message indicating that the component has 
been installed. 
 
176 

Chapter 5 
In addition, you will see an extensive greeting text. We will return to that later. For 
immediate results, install the appropriate module. Download the mbf_module.zip file 
and install it from the menu option Installers | Modules. After installation completes, you 
will see a message announcing that the module was successfully installed. 
Click Modules | Site Modules and activate the module. If you look at the bottom left hand 
corner of your web page, you will see an empty box with the heading Mambelfish. This 
happens because you have not yet configured the component. 
5.5.2 Mambelfish Configuration 
After installing Mamblefish, install all languages that you want to offer from the Site | 
Languages | Install menu. 
To make the languages available for Mambelfish, you have to enter the appropriate 
values in Components | Mambelfish | Configuration. The dialog has two tabs: Languages 
and Frontend. 
Languages 
This tab displays all the installed languages. You can select all languages and overwrite 
the default descriptions. In addition, you can specify the correct character set (ISO) and 
an image file to be displayed in place of the name, for example, a flag. You can also 
specify the order that languages should be displayed in the module: 
 
Figure 5.39: Language Configuration  
Now on the web page, the module offers both languages: 
 
Figure 5.40: Language  
Selection  
 177

Useful Extensions 
If you click on the language links, you will notice some differences. The most common 
one is the notice: 
Sorry this content is not available in your selected language 
Since we are working with Mambo sample data, they must be translated. Now let's look 
at the second tab. 
Frontend 
The settings for the website are defined in the following figure:  
 
Figure 5.41: Language Configuration in Frontend 
Two things need to be addressed here. First, what should happen to the display of content 
elements if no translation is available, and second, how should language entries in the 
module be displayed. For elements that have not been translated, there is an option to 
display alternate text. This alternate text can be chosen in the next field presented to you. 
The second option is to display the original text. The third option also offers the original 
text, however, with additional information. 
The front-end layout takes place either horizontally or vertically and either as text or as 
an image. A separator can be entered in the field below it, for use with horizontal layout. 
By default, it is the pipe symbol (|). 
5.5.3 Translation with Mambelfish 
It is very easy to translate a web page using Mambelfish component. From the 
Components | Mambelfish |Translation menu, you come to the translation area of the 
component. You get an empty window when you first access this area. Select No 
translation as language and Categories as content elements. All categories, Mambobook 
as well as others, are now displayed. Now select the language. The display without 
translation changes accordingly.

If you enable the WYSIWYG editor, pasting by mouse-click may not work. If this is the 
case, use the Shift + Insert or Ctrl + V key combination. 
Click Save to translate the first part of your website. The date of the translation appears 
in the categories list. Publish the category by clicking on the red cross icon. 
Select English as the language in the Language field and repeat the process. 
If you select All languages in the option list, translations are visible: 
 
Figure 5.44: Display of Translated Categories 
Repeat the process with a Content item. The fourth chapter is used as an example: 
 
Figure 5.45: Display of Translated Content 
On your website, the text appears in the language you selected. You can translate your 
entire website using this method. It is a lot of work but the result, especially for a 
business application, is respectable and competent. 
 
180 

Chapter 5 
5.5.4 Mambot for Mambelfish 
Mambelfish Mambot can browse the translated pages using the search module. 
Download the mbf_searchbot.zip file and click Installers | Mambots in the menu bar. 
Select the file and click Upload File & Install. The list of installed Mambots displays 
multilingual content searchbot. 
Click Mambots | Site Mambots in the menu bar and publish the newly installed 
multilingual content searchbot.When you enter text in the search field on your website, 
the translated elements are scanned and displayed in the result list if a match is found. 
5.5.5 Integrate your Own Components into Mambelfish 
By copying a table description in XML format into the directory [mambo]/ 
administrator/components/com_mambelfish/contentelements/, you can merge all 
components into the Mambelfish system. You can find an XML file for the sample 
components (see Chapter 6) in Listing 5.1 given below. 
Based on this description, Mambelfish integrates the data that has to be translated into the 
administration interface. Mambelfish can be controlled by assigning the value 0 or 1 to 
the attribute translate. 
Listing 5.1: mambobook.xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?> 
<mambelfish type="contentelement">

5.7 Document Management 
Document management is the domain of the DOCMan component (http://www. 
mambodocman.com/). With it, you can manage various kinds of documents (files) and 
make them available for download. 
Because of its ability to create categories, you can offer a different download area for 
different user groups. 
DOCMan is also suitable for closed work groups with the relevant documents made 
available in a central place. 
5.8 Web Accessibility with Mambo 
A website can contain elements that are difficult to understand by users with disabilities. 
Few content management systems provide web accessibility and Mambo is one of them. 
5.8.1 xMambo 
The xMambo project (http://mambofrog.com/) tries to make Mambo web pages usable 
to people with disabilities. xMambo 4.5 is a version of Mambo 4.5 Stable, which was 
completely rewritten to generate pure XHTML and CSS web pages and is fully compliant 
with section 508/WAI-Code (http://intetics.com/faq.html). These standards have 
to be satisfied, so that a website can fulfill the conditions for web accessibility.

Corporate Identity 
Corporate Identity (CI) refers to the self-image and the appearance of an enterprise. 
This appearance, the identity, either results from the enterprise's tradition or it is 
completely invented in a newly created establishment. This identity is important to give 
the customer a feel for the enterprise and to enable recognition. 
Corporate Identity includes: 
• 
Corporate Image (price, product, and advertising strategy) 
• 
Corporate Design (visual appearance) 
• 
Corporate Communication  
• 
Corporate Behavior (behavior of coworkers with each other and to the 
outside world) 
These areas need to be considered while developing a website. In this chapter, we will 
examine Corporate Design. At a minimum, it consists of a logo, a character font, and the 
house colors that the enterprise uses. 
The visitors to your website should recognize your enterprise on the first visit. 
6.1 HTML/XHTML, CSS, and XML 
The abbreviations HTML/XHTML, CSS, and XML stand for Internet technologies  
that Mambo works with. The World Wide Web Consortium (http://www.w3.org/) 
standardizes these technologies. 
6.1.1 HTML/XHTML 
The World Wide Web is based on HTML, a page-description language. It is not a 
programming language, but a text-description language.

Corporate Identity 
 
186 
Every text consists of structures like headings, lists, bold and italic areas, tables, and 
much more. HTML works with so-called tags. A tag has an opening and a closing form. 
For example, a first-level heading looks like this: 
<h1>This is a heading</h1> 
The tags are interpreted in a browser and the text is displayed according to their meaning. 
HTML is easy to learn and a tutorial can be found at http://www.w3schools.com 
/html/. HTML is not developed any further and the successor to HTML is XHTML 
version 1.0. 
6.1.2 CSS 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are an extension to HTML. CSS is not a programming 
language, but a vocabulary for defining the format properties of HTML elements. 
With the help of CSS commands, you can determine that first-level headings should have 
a character size of 18 points in the character font Arial, are not bold, and have a spacing 
of 1.9 cm to the next paragraph. 
Such options are not possible with pure HTML and were not necessary while developing 
it. With the progressive commercialization of the Internet, additional formatting 
possibilities do become more important. 
CSS data can be included in HTML in the following three ways: 
In the Central HTML File 
The CSS commands are defined in the head section of the HTML file: 
<head> 
<title>title of the file</title> 
<style type="text/css"> 
<!-- 
/* ... this is where the CSS commands are defined ... */ 
--> 
</style> 
</head> 
In a Separate CSS File 
If the CSS commands apply to several HTML files, they can be stored in a separate file 
and the path to this file can be specified in the HTML head section. This is the version 
that Mambo uses: 
<head> 
<title>title of the file</title> 
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="formate.css"> 
</head> 

Chapter 6 
 
187
Within an HTML Tag 
CSS commands can be integrated within an HTML tag: 
<body> 
<h1 style="… CSS command ...">...</h1> 
</body> 
Combinations 
These three methods can be combined without any problem in an HTML file. It is, for 
instance, possible to overwrite CSS commands in a central HTML file that applies to all 
pages with the subsequent source code of an HTML page. It is better to use the central 
file because overriding it results in unclear structures. 
6.1.3 XML 
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a universe in itself. It represents a 
metalanguage in which other languages are formulated. To a certain extent, it is the 
mother of all languages. For our purposes, you need XML as the description language for 
the metadata of the templates that you want to create. These metadata are primarily 
important for the template installer and the display in the Template Manager. In principle, 
these data consist of opening and closing tags. For example: 
<name>Mambo book</name> 
One difference between HTML and XML is that in XML no tags are predefined. For this 
reason, one is free in the organization of the structures and naming of tags. 
6.2 Create Your Own Templates 
Now we want to create our own template. There are several things to consider before we 
have a finished template package. 
6.2.1 Concept 
Before you start working, you have to create a concept. The work starts with a sketch or a 
diagram, especially when producing templates. Whether you create this sketch with 
programs like Adobe Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/), 
Microsoft Paint, which comes with Windows, the open-source program Gimp (http:// 
www.gimp.org/), or with a piece of paper and markers is up to you. 
Fixed Size or Variable 
You can create two kinds of templates: templates that adapt their structure to the size of 
the browser window and templates that have a fixed size. An example for the first 
flexible layout is if you have 2048 pixels on your screen and the browser window is 
maximized, then your page is stretched accordingly. It can look strange if you use

Corporate Identity 
graphics and non-scalable elements like logos and signatures in your template. You have 
no control of what it is going to look like. 
The other variation is to decide on a certain resolution and to position all elements 
exactly on the pixels in the template. The advantage is that your webpage always looks 
the way you want. Unfortunately, you do not know the default screen resolution of your 
page. Your page fills the screen with a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels. On a large screen 
with 1400 x 1050 pixels, it occupies about a quarter of the screen surface and looks a 
little lost. 
There is no real solution for this dilemma. You have to weigh the pros and cons and make 
a decision. 
If you prefer the fixed size, you should select a size that looks presentable on most 
screens, which are 800 x 600 pixels. Since the browser has a scroll bar on the right side 
and the browser window is framed, the available width is even smaller, so you have a 
maximum of 780 pixels to work with. 
Structure 
You are dealing with structured data and first have to determine a general allocation. 
Mambo normally uses a structure shown in the following figure: 
 
Figure 6.1: Structure
Section 1: 
• 
Part 1: This is where your logo or a picture and the page name go. 
• 
Part 2: This is where the search field is. 
• 
Part 3: Here is the linked navigation path (Breadcrumbs).

6.2.2 HTML Conversion 
Now you have to convert the concept into HTML. Depending on the program with which 
you created it, there is a possibility that the picture can be automatically converted to 
HTML code. You can also do the conversion manually in a text editor, in an HTML 
editor like Macromedia Dreamweaver (http://www.macromedia.com/software 
/dreamweaver/), or in one of the numerous free HTML editors (http://www. 
thefreecountry.com/webmaster/htmleditors.shtml). 
The source code of the HTML conversion looks like Listing 6.1. The code is kept simple 
and does not correspond to the XHTML standard in the head section. 
Listing 6.1: HTML Basic Structure

If you open this source code in a browser, the structure looks similar to our concept (see 
Figure 6.1). You must store this source code in a file named index.php. 
 
Figure 6.2: Basic Structure of HTML
To see the division better, the table is drawn with a border (attribute border="1"). Here 
you can give your creative juices free reign when it comes to colors and logos. 
6.2.3 File Structure of the Template 
Now it's time to think about certain conventions. The template has to be stored in a 
special directory structure. If required, you can work directly with your local Mambo 
installation. If that is too unclear, you can also store the template in an arbitrary place on 
your hard drive. You have to adhere to the following file structure: 
/templates/[name of the template]/
/templates/[name of the template]/CSS/
/templates/[name of the template]/images/
The name of the template cannot contain blanks and other special characters. Later, the 
template installer has to create a directory from this name. Depending on the operating 
system, exotic combinations of characters can cause problems; also, the name should be 
meaningful. For example, if you make the 'template chooser' module available on your 
website, this name will be offered to your visitors in the selection list. I am using 
mambobook as my template.
 
190 

Chapter 6 
 
191
Various files with certain names have to be present in the template directories. Besides 
the image files of your template, all other file names have to agree with the defaults. 
/templates/mambobook/index.php
This is the basic version of the HTML file that we created earlier. It has to have the .php 
ending, since the dynamic Mambo module element, which we will insert later, has to be 
interpreted by PHP. 
/templates/mambobook/template_thumbnail.png
A preview picture of your template for selection in Mambo administration and in the 
template chooser module will be available. Preview pictures have a format of 
approximately 227 x 162 pixels. 
/templates/mambobook/templateDetails.xml
This file represents the construction manual for the 'template installer'. Here you specify 
the location where the files are to be copied. For the example template, you can use the 
file from Listing 6.2 and provide your own data. 
Listing 6.2: templateDetails.xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

This is the CSS file of your template and the organization of the CSS file is open to you. 
However, there are standard descriptions for various side elements. You can find a table 
of these elements in the Appendix. For your first attempt, you need an empty CSS file 
with this name. 
/templates/mambobook/images/[user-defined picture files]
Here you can store arbitrary image files, which will be used in your template. The 
installer then copies the files into the 'image' sorter.

6.2.4 First Trial Run 
You can see and access your new template in Mambo administration once you have 
reconstructed all the structures in the [mambo]/templates/ subdirectory: 
 
Figure 6.3: New Template
When you open your website, you will see the structure as shown in Figure 6.2. 
Unfortunately, no content is shown yet. Since this content is produced dynamically, you 
have to integrate it piece by piece into your new template. 
6.2.5 Integration of the Mambo Module 
The integration of the Mambo module takes place by means of PHP commands that are 
embedded into the HTML code. If you insert the following lines in place of the title tag in 
the head section of the index.php file, the favicon and the title of the page are displayed: 
<head> 
<?php mosShowHead(); ?> 
</head> 
 
Figure 6.4: Favicon and Page Title
If you view the source code of this page, you will notice that Mambo has written the 
entire metadata, which you had entered in Administration, into the HTML code. 
Listing 6.3: Mambo Metadata 
... 
<head> 
<title>Mambo452 - Home</title> 
<meta name="description" content="Mambo - the dynamic portal engine 
and content management system" /> 
<meta name="keywords" content="mambo, Mambo" /> 
<meta name="Generator" content="Mambo - Copyright 2000 - 2005 Miro 
International Pty Ltd. All rights reserved." /> 
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />

</head> 
... 
Since this has worked so well, we will waste no time and get to the other relevant PHP 
modules that deal with functions. For example, the function mosLoad-Modules()  
expects the location of the module (right, left, user1...) as parameter. You can assign  
this place in the 'Module Manager'. The function then displays all modules with the 
appropriate parameter. 
The following listing shows the complete source code of the index.php file with  
PHP modules:

If you open the homepage with the changed HTML code on a local server, you will see 
dynamic content. Your new template is filled with data. You are now working with pure 
HTML code and the results look like they could benefit from some visual improvement: 
 
Figure 6.5: Template with Dynamic Data
To refine the visual aspect, we will take a small step into CSS formatting. Copy the 
following code into your template_css.css file (Listing 6.5). Here it is specified  
that the default font is Arial, the links are not to be underlined, and the script will be 
displayed in another color and bold font if you roll over a link with your mouse (see 
http://en.selfhtml.org/css/). 
Listing 6.5: template_css.css 
body { 
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; 
} 
a:link, a:visited { 
color: #ff6600; 
text-decoration: none;

Chapter 6 
font-weight: bold; 
} 
a:hover { 
color: #C43C03; 
text-decoration: none; 
font-weight: bold; 
} 
Now your template looks a little more attractive. Point the mouse on the Search link in 
the main menu. The link is displayed in bold and in another color: 
 
Figure 6.6: Template with CSS file
6.2.6 Creating a Template Package 
To complete your template, create a current preview picture of your template (template_ 
thumbnail.png) and pack all the files with subdirectories into a ZIP archive. 
In addition, assign all files and folders to the folder [mambo]/templates/mambobook/ 
and pack all the contents into the mambobook.zip file. Make a backup of this file and the 
ZIP file. 
 
195
To test the installation, remove the template from the Template Manager. To accomplish 
this, specify another template as the default (select the template and click Publish), delete 
the newly created template by selecting it, and click Delete.

6.2.7 Installation with the Mambo Template Installer 
After you have eliminated traces of development, go to the menu Installers | Template 
Site, select the mambobook.zip file, and click Upload File & Install. You will see the 
success screen of the template installer. A description from the XML file is displayed in 
the following figure:

6.3 Dreamweaver Extension 
There is an extension for the HTML editor Dreamweaver with which you can produce 
templates. After installing the extension, you get a Mambo pallet with the available 
elements, which you can insert with a mouse-click into your template (http://www. 
mambosolutions.com/dw_tutorial/).

Your Own Program Extensions 
Let's say that you want to solve a problem for which there is no completed Mambo 
component, for example, a list of your used cars or your addresses. Simply extend the 
functional range with new components, modules, and Mambots. What looks complicated 
at first sight is feasible with basic knowledge of PHP. 
After your experience with building templates, you know what is to come. To get an idea 
of what is being discussed here, you need: 
• 
A new component consisting of a frontend, a Mambo administration, and a 
special table in the database 
• 
An additional module to display the entries on your website 
• 
A search Mambot to browse your new content 
Here is an example of a simple list on the website: 
 
Figure 7.1: Your Component on the Website 

Your Own Program Extensions 
This list can have user-defined content (addresses, offers, etc.). For the customer, it is 
usually sufficient to see the list. The administrator, however, has to administer the list by: 
• 
Making new entries 
• 
Modifying existing entries 
• 
Deleting existing entries 
To make the example simple, we are displaying and working on only one field. This way 
the principle becomes clear and the example can be easily extended into multiple fields. 
The following figure illustrates the basic administrative interface of the list: 
 
Figure 7.2: Your Component in Mambo Administration 
7.1 Sample Mambobook Component 
Let's start with the component. Since this component can become the basis for many 
different lists, I call it Mambobook. You can download the finished example, install it 
like the other components, and reproduce it manually. The advantage of reproduction is 
that you can gradually check out the structures and get a taste for it. 
7.1.1 The MySQL Table 
Since you are starting from scratch, you need a new table in MySQL. You can create the 
desired table in the following ways: 
• 
Write a PHP program that creates the table 
• 
Work from the MySQL console 
• 
Control MySQL with a tool like phpMyAdmin 
With xampplite and most web space providers, you receive the phpMyAdmin tool for 
database management (http://www.phpmyadmin.net/). With this program, which is 
written in PHP like Mambo, you can directly manipulate your MySQL tables. Activate 
phpMyAdmin in xampplite by opening the http://localhost/phpmyadmin URL in 
your browser: 
 
198 

Chapter 7 
 
Figure 7.3: phpMyAdmin 
From the left panel, select the database that contains your Mambo tables. If you have 
only one database in your hosting packet, you end up directly in your Mambo database 
with some providers by opening phpMyAdmin. With xampplite, you can set up numerous 
databases if required. 
Databases like MySQL are controlled with SQL commands. The Structured Query 
Language is a data manipulation language that is similar to set theory, which emerged in 
the seventies. The idea behind SQL is to use a few commands like Alter, Delete, 
Insert, and Create with a precisely defined quantity of data. 
For the component example, you need SQL commands to create a table and insert data. 
Listing 7.1: SQL Commands for the Example Table 
-- Table structure for table `mos_mambo_book` 
CREATE TABLE `mos_mambo_book` ( 
           `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
           `text` TEXT NOT NULL, 
           `published` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL, 
            PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ); 
-- Data for table `mos_mambo_book` 
INSERT INTO `mos_mambo_book` VALUES (11,'BMW 1', 1); 
INSERT INTO `mos_mambo_book` VALUES (9,'Renault Kangoo', 1); 
INSERT INTO `mos_mambo_book` VALUES (8,'Audi A6', 1); 
INSERT INTO `mos_mambo_book` VALUES (7,'VW Golf', 1); 
INSERT INTO `mos_mambo_book` VALUES (10,'Mercedes G', 1); 
To deliver these SQL commands to the database, click SQL, insert the commands into the 
form, and click OK: 
 199

Figure 7.4: Importing the Table Structure 
MySQL creates the new mos_mambo_book table and inserts five data records. Click 
mos_mambo_book and then Show to see the following result: 
 
Figure 7.5: Newly Created mos_mambo_book Table 
With this, we have created the table and can leave phpMyAdmin for now. The installer 
component will later assume this job with the automatic installation in Mambo. 
7.1.2 The Frontend 
Your homepage is the frontend. To increase the anticipation a little bit, we will start with 
the frontend.
 
200 

Chapter 7 
If you take a quick look into your [mambo]/components directory, you will notice that all 
directories begin with com_ followed by a description (com_contact, com_content, etc.). 
This is where your installed components are stored. To open a component in the browser, 
specify the name of this subdirectory as value in the option parameter in the URL: 
http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_contact
For your components, create a new subdirectory with the name [mambo]/components/ 
mambobook. Create two files in this subdirectory: 
• 
mambobook.php: This file contains the logic in pure PHP code. For example, 
the database is queried here. 
• 
mambobook.html.php: This file contains the presentation of the data. PHP is 
also used here, but the emphasis lies on HTML and CSS code. 
mambobook.php 
This file consists of four arrays and a few more lines (see Listing 7.2). 
The first array ensures that it is not possible to open the file directly by the input of the 
file name and it can be opened only from another file. This is a security measure because 
the component is not executable without the Mambo system. Moreover, the source code 
of the second (mambo.html.php) file is merged here. Since this merging is standard for 
the HTML interface, there is a getPath() procedure that looks in the same directory for 
an appropriate file to merge with. The name is created from the directory's name with an 
html.php ending. 
In the second array, parameters are transferred. Here the HTML title of the page appears 
in the upper blue bar of the browser. 
The third array contains a case differentiation. You can open the component with 
different parameters and interpret them here. For example, the differentiation here could 
be between an overview and an individual view. 
The fourth array contains the actual logic. Here the database is queried, a result array is 
created, and the showtable() procedure in the HTML_mambobook class is opened. This 
class is in the merged mambobook.html.php file. 
Listing 7.2: mambobook.php 
<?php 
//Array 1 
/* ensure that this file is called up by another file */ 
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or ( 'Direct access of this file is 
prohibited.' 
); 
// Loading of the HTML class 
require_once( $mainframe->getPath( 'front_html' ) ); 
// Array 2 
$mainframe->setPageTitle( "Example component Mambobook" ); 
// Array 3 
switch( $task ) { 
 201

Your Own Program Extensions 
  case 'free': 
    // more display possibilities 
    break; 
  default: 
    listMambobook(); 
    break; 
} 
// Array 4 
function listMambobook( ) { 
  global $database; 
  /* SQL query of all published entries */ 
  $query = "SELECT * FROM #__mambo_book WHERE published='1'"; 
  $database->setQuery( $query ); 
  $rows = $database->loadObjectList(); 
  HTML_mambobook::showtable( &$rows ); 
} 
?> 
mambobook.html.php 
The mambobook.html.php file (see Listing 7.3) contains the HTML_mambobook class. A 
class is like a structural plan with many procedures. Our small class contains only the 
showTable procedure. 
An array is handed over to the showTable procedure (&$rows) and is represented in a 
table. To achieve this, a foreach loop continues running until there are no more elements. 
With each run a different value is generated for the variable $k. $k controls the CSS class 
of a table row (class="sectiontableentry<?php echo ($k+1); ?>"). Consequently, 
the rows are reproduced in two different colors as illustrated in Figure 7.1. 
In principle, as many procedures as desired can be implemented in the class; beside the 
table view there could also be, for example, an individual view. 
The class represents a structural design and should be filled with data. This makes it 
comparable to a template. For this reason, the class is also merged with the 
mambobook.php file and is started by running HTML_mambobook::showtable( $rows );. 
Listing 7.3: mambobook.html.php 
<?php 
/* ensuring that this file is called up from another file */ 
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or ( 'Direct access to this file is 
prohibited.' 
); 
class HTML_mambobook { 
  // Procedure for building the table 
  function showTable( $rows ) { 
    ?> 
    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" 
                                                   align="center"> 
    <tr> 
    <td height="20" class="sectiontableheader"> 
    <?php echo "heading"; ?> 
    </td> 
    </tr> 
    <?php 
 
202 

Chapter 7 
    // the variable $k helps to enable the different colors 
    // per row. 
    $k = 0; 
    foreach ($rows as $row) { 
      ?> 
      <tr> 
      // $k takes on the value 0 or 1 and thereby calls  
      // either the CSS class sectiontableentry1 or 
      // sectiontableentry2  
      <td height="20" class="sectiontableentry<?php echo ($k+1); ?>"> 
      // access to the DB field text 
      <?php echo $row->text; ?> 
      </td> 
      <?php 
      $k = 1 - $k; 
    } 
    ?> 
    </table> 
    <?php 
  } 
} 
?> 
7.1.3 Integration into the Main Menu 
Mambo cannot detect the component since it is not completely installed. However, you 
can open it via the URL http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_mambobook. 
You can merge the components with the main menu at this stage of development via the 
Link-URL option. In Mambo administration, click Menu | Main menu | New. At the 
bottom right, select Link-URL and click Next. Here you can enter a description and the 
above-mentioned link: 
 
Figure 7.6: Menu Entry per URL 
 203

Your Own Program Extensions 
If you open your website, you should see the menu link Mambobook. Click on it to view 
the table shown in Figure 7.1. 
That was surprisingly simple, wasn't it? You should seriously try to become familiar with 
object-oriented programming and the syntaxes of PHP, HTML, and CSS. Nevertheless, 
you can still create impressive tables with a few lines of code. 
7.1.4 Mambo Administration 
Displaying data on the webpage was relatively simple, but administering data, naturally, 
will be a little more complex. Here you have to display the data, modify it, reinsert it, and 
delete it. This implies substantially more functionality than on the webpage. 
The Component Table 
Mambo administers the menu entries of all components in the mos_components table. 
Since you are not using an installer and building everything by hand, you need two new 
menu entries. 
Open phpMyAdmin, select the mos_components table, click SQL, insert the two SQL 
commands (see Listing 7.4), and click OK to confirm. 
Listing 7.4: SQL Commands Menu Entry 
INSERT INTO `mos_components` VALUES ( 'Mambobook', 
'option=com_mambobook', 0, 0, 
'option=com_mambobook', 'Mambobook', 'com_mambobook', 0, 
'js/ThemeOffice/component.png', 0, ''); 
INSERT INTO `mos_components` VALUES ('Edit entries', '', 0, 46, 
'option=com_mambobook&act=all', 'Edit entries', 'com_mambobook', 0, 
'js/ThemeOffice/component.png', 0, ''); 
By inserting these two data sets, you extend the Components menu by a main 
Mambobook entry and an Edit Entries submenu entry: 
 
Figure 7.7: New Component in the Components Menu 
 
204 

Chapter 7 
In addition, you can specify what the respective menu entry calls up (option=com_ 
mambobook&act=all') and the picture that is to appear on the left, next to the menu 
('js/ThemeOffice/component.png'). You can find the pictures in the 
[mambo]/includes/js/ThemeOffice folder. 
This time you need, not two, but five files. Create a subdirectory called com_mambobook 
under the [mambo]/administration/components/ directory. In this subdirectory, create 
the following five files: 
• 
admin.mambobook.php 
• 
mambobook.class.php 
• 
admin.mambobook.html.php 
• 
toolbar.mambobook.html.php 
• 
toolbar.mambobook.php 
admin.mambobook.php  
This file contains the logic. Here we go another step further and partially swap the 
database queries to mambobook.class.php. In principle, the structure is specified like the 
front-end logic. The file is more extensive, since several cases are possible and in each 
case, it must be implemented with a function. In addition, the access rights are examined 
at the beginning, since we are in Mambo administration. 
Listing 7.5: admin.mambobook.php 
<?php 
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or ( 'Direct access to this file is 
prohibited.' 
); 
// Examine access rights 
if (!($acl->acl_check( 'administration', 'edit', 'users',  
$my->usertype, 'components', 'all' ) | $acl->acl_check( 
'administration', 'edit', 'users', $my->usertype, 'components', 
'com_newsfeeds' ))) { 
mosRedirect( 'index2.php', _NOT_AUTH ); 
} 
// Loading of the database class and the HTML class 
require_once( $mainframe->getPath( 'admin_html' ) ); 
require_once( $mainframe->getPath( 'class' ) ); 
$task = mosGetParam( $_REQUEST, 'task', array(0) ); 
// Case differentiation 
switch ($task) { 
  case "publish": 
    publishMambobook( $id, 1, $option ); 
    break; 
  case "unpublish": 
    publishMambobook( $id, 0, $option ); 
    break; 
  case "new": 
    editMambobook( 0, $option );

compress them all into a ZIP package named com_mambobook.zip. You can install this 
ZIP file with the installer component and if required, make it available for download.

A module is lot simpler. You need two files; one for the logic (in this case, the 
presentation is handled mainly by the template) and an XML file for the installer module.

Pack the two files in a ZIP package with the name mod_mambobook.zip and install it with 
the installer module:

7.2.3 View of the Website 
You will see the entries on the website in the left module space:

7.3 Mambots 
You need a Mambot to browse the list. Just like modules, create the PHP file with the 
logic (see Listing 7.15) and the XML file with the description (see Listing 7.16). Pack 
both files in a ZIP package, bot_mambobook.zip, and install it with the Mambot installer:

If you activate the Mambot from the Mambots | Site Mambots menu, your list is searched 
via the search field on the website. After entering a search word, the field text in the 
database is scanned and the results are displayed in the common search mask as shown in 
Figure 7.14. 
The searchbot is kept simple on purpose. The individual view of each list element should 
be linked to the place of discovery within the search results, so that the searcher can go 
there. Since we did not plan an individual view in our component, we cannot display a 
link here.

7.4 End Remarks 
This chapter gives an overview on producing components, modules, and Mambots. 
You can use components from similar applications and develop them further. For 
example, our Mambobook component has one table view. Look for a component with an 
individual view (com_contact) and extend your Mambobook with this functionality. The 
same is true for specified parameters in modules. You can look for a model and create 
your own module. 
What looks complicated at first sight is quite transparent on closer inspection. 
Have fun experimenting!

A.2 Templates 
Templates contain many elements. The most important elements are the CSS arrays and 
the embedded PHP code. 
A.2.1 CSS 
In different Mambo versions, different names have become ingrained for certain arrays. 
These arrays are also called classes in CSS. I would like to show you four examples. If a 
class that does not exist in the CSS file is called, nothing changes in the display. Because 
of the multiplicity of versions and extensions, you are always well advised to look at the 
HTML code to get an overview of the classes used. 
Head Area 
Here you see the CSS definitions (Listing A.1) reflected in the head area and the 
respective areas on the website (Figure A.1). The CSS code is to serve as an example. 
Not all areas are provided with CSS examples. Look at the CSS files of predefined 
templates to find further examples: 
Listing A.1: CSS Definitions: Head Area 
.title { 
  font-family: sans-serif; 
  font-size: 20px; 
  font-weight: bold;

A.3 Mambo API 
The Application Programming Interface (API) describes which functions are in the 
source code, at what place, and what they do:  
 
Figure A.5: Mambo API 
 
226 

Appendix A 
It consists of static HTML pages, which are produced automatically by the source code. 
You can unpack the MamboV4.5.2-API-Html.zip file wherever you like and start it by 
double-clicking the index.html file. If you intend to develop your own components, the 
API is a good reference point. 
A.4 Forgot your Admin Password? 
If you have forgotten your admin password, you can change it directly in the database. To 
do that you need a tool like phpMyAdmin. In the xampplite environment, you can launch 
it in your browser using the URL http://localhost/phpmyadmin. 
There you select the database you are using. There is a mos_users table in this database. 
In this table, look for the user admin. The password is encrypted using the MD5 
algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5). You can change it by selecting the 
MD5 entry in the option list, left of the field, and entering the password in plain text: 
 
Figure A.6: Changing the Admin Password 
Many providers also offer phpMyAdmin for the maintenance of your database.

Thank you for buying Building Websites with 
Mambo: A Step by Step Tutorial 
Packt Open Source Project Royalties 
When we sell a book written on an Open Source project, we pay a royalty directly to that 
project. Therefore by purchasing Buiding Websites with Mambo: A Step by Step Tutorial, 
Packt will have given some of the money received to the Mambo project. 
In the long term, we see ourselves and you—customers and readers of our books—as part 
of the Open Source ecosystem, providing sustainable revenue for the projects we publish 
on. Our aim at Packt is to establish publishing royalties as an essential part of the service 
and support a business model that sustains Open Source. 
If you're working with an Open Source project that you would like us to publish on, and 
subsequently pay royalties to, please get in touch with us. 
Writing for Packt 
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to authors@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and 
you would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us: one of 
our commissioning editors will get in touch with you.  
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no 
writing experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or 
simply get some additional reward for your expertise. 
About Packt Publishing
