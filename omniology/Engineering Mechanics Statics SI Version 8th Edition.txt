fOREWORD 
This series of textbooks was begun in 1951 by the late Dr. James L. Meriam. At that 
time, the books represented a revolutionary transformation in undergraduate mechanics 
education. They became the definitive textbooks for the decades that followed as well as 
models for other engineering mechanics texts that have subsequently appeared. Published 
under slightly different titles prior to the 1978 First Editions, this textbook series has 
always been characterized by logical organization, clear and rigorous presentation of the 
theory, instructive sample problems, and a rich collection of real-life problems, all with a 
high standard of illustration. In addition to the U.S. versions, the books have appeared in 
SI versions and have been translated into many foreign languages. These textboks collec­
tively represent an international standard for undergraduate texts in mechanics. 
The innovations and contributions of Dr. Meriam (1917-2000) to the field of engineer­
ing mechanics cannot be overstated. He was one of the premier engineering educators of 
the second half of the twentieth century. Dr. Meriam earned the B.E., M.Eng., and Ph.D. 
degrees from Yale University. He had early industrial experience with Pratt and Whitney 
Aircraft and the General Electric Company. During the Second World War he served in the 
U.S. Coast Guard. He was a member of the faculty of the University of California-Berkeley, 
Dean of Engineering at Duke University, a faculty member at the California Polytechnic 
State University, and visiting professor at the University of California-Santa Barbara, 
finally retiring in 1990. Professor Meriam always placed great emphasis on teaching, and 
this trait was recognized by his students wherever he taught. He was the recipient of sev­
eral teaching awards, including the Benjamin Garver Lamme Award, which is the highest 
annual national award of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE). 
Dr. L. Glenn Kraige, coauthor of the Engineering Mechanics series since the early 
1980s, has also made significant contributions to mechanics education. Dr. Kraige earned 
his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Virginia, principally in aerospace 
engineering, and he is Professor Emeritus of Engineering Science and Mechanics at 
Vrginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. During the mid-1970s, I had the singular 
pleasure of chairing Professor Kraige's graduate committee and take particular pride in 
the fact that he was the first of my fifty Ph.D. graduates. Professor Kraige was invited by 
Professor Meriam to team with him, thereby ensuring that the Meriam legacy of textbook 
authorship excellence would be carried forward to future generations of engineers. 
In addition to his widely recognized research and publications in the field of spacecraft 
dynamics, Professor Kraige has devoted his attention to the teaching of mechanics at both 
introductory and advanced levels. His outstanding teaching has been widely recognized 
and has earned him teaching awards at the departmental, college, university, state, re­
gional, and national levels. These awards include the Outstanding Educator Award from 
the State Council of Higher Education for the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1996, the 
v 

vi Foreword 
Mechanics Division of ASEE bestowed upon him the Archie Higdon Distinguished Educator 
Award. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advance­
ment and Support of Education awarded him the distinction ofVirginia Professor of the Year for 
1997. In his teaching, Professor Kraige stresses the development of analytical capabilities along 
with the strengthening of physical insight and engineering judgment. Since the early 1980s, he 
has worked on personal-computer software designed to enhance the teaching/learning process 
in statics, dynamics, strength of materials, and higher-level areas of dynamics and vibrations. 
Welcomed as a new coauthor for this edition is Dr. Jeffrey N. Bolton, Assistant Professor of 
Mechanical Engineering Technology at Bluefield State College. Dr. Bolton earned his B.S., M.S., 
and Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. 
His research interests include automatic balancing of six-degree-of-freedom elastically-mounted 
rotors. He has a wealth of teaching experience, including at Virginia Tech, where he was the 
2010 recipient of the Sporn Teaching Award for Engineering Subjects, which is primarily chosen 
by students. In 2014, Professor Bolton received the Outstanding Faculty Award from Bluefield 
State College. He has the unusual ability to set high levels of rigor and achievement in the 
classroom while establishing a high degree of rapport with his students. In addition to main­
taining time-tested traditions for future generations of students, Dr. Bolton will bring effective 
application of technology to this textbook series. 
The Eighth Edition of Engineering Mechanics continues the same high standards set by 
previous editions and adds new features of help and interest to students. It contains a vast col­
lection of interesting and instructive problems. The faculty and students privileged to teach or 
study from the Meriam/Kraige/Bolton Engineering Mechanics series will benefit from several 
decades of investment by three highly accomplished educators. Following the pattern of the pre­
vious editions, this textbook stresses the application of theory to actual engineering situations, 
and at this important task it remains the best.

PREFACE 
Engineering mechanics is both a foundation and a framework for most of the branches 
of engineering. Many of the topics in such areas as civil, mechanical, aerospace, and 
agricultural engineering, and of course engineering mechanics itselM are based upon the 
subjects of statics and dynamics. Even in a discipline such as electrical engineering, prac­
titioners, in the course of considering the electrical components of a robotic device or a 
manufacturing process, may find themselves first having to deal with the mechanics 
involved. 
Thus, the engineering mechanics sequence is critical to the engineering curriculum. 
Not only is this sequence needed in itself, but courses in engineering mechanics also serve 
to solidify the student's understanding of other important subjects, including applied 
mathematics, physics, and graphics. In addition, these courses serve as excellent settings 
in which to strengthen problem-solving abilities. 
PHILOSOPHY 
The primary purpose of the study of engineering mechanics is to develop the capacity 
to predict the effects of force and motion while carrying out the creative design functions 
of engineering. This capacity requires more than a mere knowledge of the physical and 
mathematical principles of mechanics; also required is the ability to visualize physical 
configurations in terms of real materials, actual constraints, and the practical limitations 
which govern the behavior of machines and structures. One of the primary objectives in a 
mechanics course is to help the student develop this ability to visualize, which is so vital 
to problem formulation. Indeed, the construction of a meaningful mathematical model is 
often a more important experience than its solution. Maximum progress is made when 
the principles and their limitations are learned together within the context of engineering 
application. 
There is a frequent tendency in the presentation of mechanics to use problems mainly 
as a vehicle to illustrate theory rather than to develop theory for the purpose of solving 
problems. When the first view is allowed to predominate, problems tend to become overly 
idealized and unrelated to engineering with the result that the exercise becomes dull, aca­
demic, and uninteresting. This approach deprives the student of valuable experience in 
formulating problems and thus of discovering the need for and meaning of theory. The 
second view provides by far the stronger motive for learning theory and leads to a better 
balance between theory and application. The crucial role played by interest and purpose in 
providing the strongest possible motive for learning cannot be overemphasized. 
Furthermore, as mechanics educators, we should stress the understanding that, at 
best, theory can only approximate the real world of mechanics rather than the view that 
vii 

viii Preface 
the real world approximates the theory. This difference in philosophy is indeed basic and 
distinguishes the engineering of mechanics from the science of mechanics. 
Over the past several decades, several unfortunate tendencies have occurred in engi­
neering education. First, emphasis on the geometric and physical meanings of prerequisite 
mathematics appears to have diminished. Second, there has been a significant reduction 
and even elimination of instruction in graphics, which in the past enhanced the visual­
ization and representation of mechanics problems. Third, in advancing the mathematical 
level of our treatment of mechanics, there has been a tendency to allow the notational 
manipulation of vector operations to mask or replace geometric visualization. Mechanics is 
inherently a subject which depends on geometric and physical perception, and we should 
increase our efforts to develop this ability. 
A special note on the use of computers is in order. The experience of formulating prob­
lems, where reason and judgment are developed, is vastly more important for the student 
than is the manipulative exercise in carrying out the solution. For this reason, computer 
usage must be carefully controlled. At present, constructing free-body diagrams and for­
mulating governing equations are best done with pencil and paper. On the other hand, 
there are instances in which the solution to the governing equations can best be carried 
out and displayed using the computer. Computer-<>riented problems should be genuine in 
the sense that there is a condition of design or criticality to be found, rather than "make­
work" problems in which some parameter is varied for no apparent reason other than to 
force artificial use of the computer. These thoughts have been kept in mind during the 
design of the computer-oriented problems in the Eighth Edition. To conserve adequate 
time for problem formulation, it is suggested that the student be assigned only a limited 
number of the computer-<>riented problems. 
As with previous editions, this Eighth Edition of Engineering Mechanics is written 
with the foregoing philosophy in mind. It is intended primarily for the first engineering 
course in mechanics, generally taught in the second year of study. Engineering Mechanics 
is written in a style which is both concise and friendly. The major emphasis is on basic 
principles and methods rather than on a multitude of special cases. Strong effort has been 
made to show both the cohesiveness of the relatively few fundamental ideas and the great 
variety of problems which these few ideas will solve. 
PEDAGOGICAL fEATURES 
The basic structure of this textbook consists of an article which rigorously treats the 
particular subject matter at hand, followed by one or more Sample Problems, followed by 
a group of Problems. There is a Chapter Review at the end of each chapter which summa­
rizes the main points in that chapter, followed by a Review Problem set. 
Problems 
The 89 Sample Problems appear on specially colored pages by themselves. The solu­
tions to typical statics problems are presented in detail. In addition, explanatory and cau­
tionary notes (Helpful Hints) in blue type are number-keyed to the main presentation. 
There are 1060 homework exercises, of which more than 50 percent are new to the 
Eighth Edition. The problem sets are divided into Introductory Problems and Represen­
tative Problems. The first section consists of simple, uncomplicated problems designed to 
help students gain confidence with the new topic, while most of the problems in the second 
section are of average difficulty and length. The problems are generally arranged in order 
of increasing difficulty. More difficult exercises appear near the end of the Representative 
Problems and are marked with the triangular symbol ..,. . Computer-Oriented Problems, 

marked with an asterisk, appear throughout the problems and also in a special section at 
the conclusion of the Review Problems at the end of each chapter. The answers to all prob­
lems have been provided in a special section near the end of the textbook. 
SI units are used throughout the book, except in a limited number of introductory 
areas in which U.S. units are mentioned for purposes of completeness and contrast with 
SI units. 
A notable feature of the Eighth Edition, as with all previous editions, is the wealth of 
interesting and important problems which apply to engineering design. Whether directly 
identified as such or not, virtually all of the problems deal with principles and procedures 
inherent in the design and analysis of engineering structures and mechanical systems. 
Illustrations 
In order to bring the greatest possible degree of realism and clarity to the illustra­
tions, this textbook series continues to be produced in full color. It is important to note that 
color is used consistently for the identification of certain quantities: 
• red for forces and moments 
• green for velocity and acceleration arrows 
• orange dashes for selected trlijectories of moving points 
Subdued colors are used for those parts of an illustration which are not central to 
the problem at hand. Whenever possible, mechanisms or objects which commonly have a 
certain color will be portrayed in that color. All of the fundamental elements of technical 
illustration which have been an essential part of this Engineering Mechanics series of 
textbooks have been retained. The authors wish to restate the conviction that a high stan­
dard of illustration is critical to any written work in the field of mechanics. 
Special Features 
We have retained the following hallmark features of previous editions: 
• All theory portions are constantly reexamined in order to maximize rigor, clarity, 
readability, and level of friendliness. 
• Key Concepts areas within the theory presentation are specially marked and high­
lighted. 
• The Chapter Reviews are highlighted and feature itemized summaries. 
• Approximately 50 percent of the homework problems are new to this Eighth Edition. 
All new problems have been independently solved in order to ensure a high degree of 
accuracy. 
• All Sample Problems are printed on specially colored pages for quick identification. 
• Within-the-chapter photographs are provided in order to provide additional connec­
tion to actual situations in which statics has played a major role. 
ORGANIZATION 
In Chapter 1, the fundamental concepts necessary for the study of mechanics are 
established. 
In Chapter 2, the properties of forces, moments, couples, and resultants are developed 
so that the student may proceed directly to the equilibrium of nonconcurrent force sys­
tems in Chapter S without unnecessarily belaboring the relatively trivial problem of the 
equilibrium of concurrent forces acting on a particle. 
Preface ix 

X Preface 
In both Chapters 2 and 3, analysis of two-dimensional problems is presented in Sec­
tion A before three-dimensional problems are treated in Section B. With this arrangement, 
the instructor may cover all of Chapter 2 before beginning Chapter 3 on equilibrium, or 
the instructor may cover the two chapters in the order 2A, SA, 2B, 3B. The latter order 
treats force systems and equilibrium in two dimensions and then treats these topics in 
three dimensions. 
Application of equilibrium principles to simple trusses and to frames and machines is 
presented in Chapter 4 with primary attention given to two-dimensional systems. A suf­
ficient number of three-dimensional examples are included, however, to enable students to 
exercise more general vector tools of analysis. 
The concepts and categories of distributed forces are introduced at the begining of 
Chapter 5, with the balance of the chapter divided into two main sections. Section A treats 
centroids and mass centers; detailed examples are presented to help students master 
early applications of calculus to physical and geometrical problems. Section B includes the 
special topics of beams, flexible cables, and fluid forces, which may be omitted without loss 
of continuity of basic concepts. 
Chapter 6 on friction is divided into Section A on the phenomenon of dry friction and 
Section B on selected machine applications. Although Section B may be omitted if time is 
limited, this material does provide a valuable experience for the student in dealing with 
both concentrated and distributed friction forces. 
Chapter 7 presents a consolidated introduction to virtual work with applications lim­
ited to single-degree-of-freedom systems. Special emphasis is placed on the advantage of 
the virtual-work and energy method for interconnected systems and stability determina­
tion. Virtual work provides an excellent opportunity to convince the student of the power 
of mathematical analysis in mechanics. 
Moments and products of inertia of areas are presented in Appendix A. This topic 
helps to bridge the subjects of statics and solid mechanics. Appendix C contains a sum­
mary review of selected topics of elementary mathematics as well as several numerical 
techniques which the student should be prepared to use in computer-solved problems. 
Useful tables of physical constants, centroids, and moments of inertia are contained in 
Appendix D.

MECHANICS 
Mechanics is the phy ical science which deals with the effects of 
forces on objects. No other subject plays a greater role in engineering 
analysis than mechanics. Although the principles of mechanics are few, 
they have wide application in engineering. The principles of mechanics 
are central to research and development in the fields of vibrations, sta­
bility and strength of structures and machines, robotics, rocket and 
spacecraft design, automatic control, engine performance, fluid flow, 
electrical machines and apparatus, and molecular, atomic, and sub­
atomic behavior. A thorough understanding of this subject is an essen­
tial prerequisite for work in these and many other fields. 
Mechanics is the oldest of he physical sciences. The early history of 
this subject is synonymous with the very beginings of engineering. 
The earliest recorded writings in mechanics are those of Archimedes 
(287-212 B.c.) on the principle of the lever and the principle of buoy­
ancy. Substantial progre s came later with the formulation of the laws 
of vector combination of forces by Stevinus (1548-1620), who also 
formulated most of the principles of statics. The first investigation of a 
dynamics problem is credited to Galileo (1564-1642) for his experiments 
Sir Isaac Newton 
with falling stones. The accurate formulation of the laws of motion, as 
well as the law of gravitation, was made by Newton (1642-1727), who 
3

Intro d uction to Statics 
also oonceived the idea of the infinitesimal in mathematical analysis. Sub­
stantial contributions to the development of mechanics were also made 
by da Vinci, Varignon, Euler, D' Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, and others. 
In this book we will be ooncerned with both the development of the 
principles of mechanics and their application. The principles of mechan­
ics as a science are rigorously expressed by mathematics, and thus 
mathematics plays an important role in the application of these princi­
ples to the solution of practical problems. 
The subject of mechanics is logically divided into two parts: statics, 
which concerns the equilibrium of bodies under action of forces, and 
dynamics, which concerns the motion of bodies. Engineering Mechan­
ics is divided into these two parts, Vol. 1 Statics and Vol. 2 Dynamics. 
1/2 
BASIC CONCEPTS 
The following ooncepts and definitions are basic to the study of me­
chanics, and they should be understood at the outset. 
Space is the geometric region occupied by bodies whose positions 
are described by linear and angular measurements relative to a coordi­
nate system. For three-dimensional problems, three independent coordi­
nates are needed. For two-dimensional problems, only two coordinates 
are required. 
Time is the measure of the succession of events and is a basic quan­
tity in dynamics. Time is not directly involved in the analysis of statics 
problems. 
Mass is a measure of the inertia of a body, which is its resistance to 
a change of velocity. Mass can also be thought of as the quantity of mat­
ter in a body. The mass of a body affects tbe gravitational attraction 
force between it and other bodies. This force appears in many applica­
tions in statics. 
Force is the action of one body on another. A force tends to move a 
body in tbe direction of its action. The action of a force is characterized 
by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of ap­
plication. Thus force is a vector quantity, and its properties are dis­
cussed in detail in Chapter 2. 
A particle is a body of negligible dimensions. In the mathematical 
sense, a particle is a body whose dimensions are considered to be near 
zero so that we may analyze it as a mass concentrated at a point. We 
often choose a particle as a differential element of a body. We may treat 
a body as a particle when its dimensions are irrelevant to the descrip­
tion of its position or the action of forces applied to it. 
Rigid body. A body is considered rigid when the change in distance 
between any two of its points is negligible for the purpose at hand. For 
instance, the calculation of the tension in the cable which supports the 
boom of a mobile crane under load is essentially unaffected by the small 
internal deformations in the structural members of the boom. For the 
purpose, then, of determining the external forces which act on the boom, 
we may treat it as a rigid body. Statics deals primarily with the calcula­
tion of external forces which act on rigid bodies in equilibrium. Determi­
nation of the internal deformations belongs to the study of the mechanics 
of deformable bodies, which normally follows statics in the curriculum. 

1/3 
SCALARS AND VECTORS 
We use two kinds of quantities in mechanics-scalars and vectors. 
Scalar quantities are those with which only a magnitude is associated. 
Examples of scalar quantities are time, volume, density, speed, energy, 
and mass. Vector quantities, on the other hand, possess direction as well 
as magnitude, and must obey the parallelogram law of addition as de­
scribed later in this article. Examples of vector quantities are displace­
ment, velocity, acceleration, force, moment, and momentum. Speed is a 
scalar. It is the magnitude of velocity, which is a vector. Thus velocity is 
specified by a direction as well as a speed. 
Vectors representing physical quantities can be classified as free, 
sliding, or fixed. 
A free vector is one whose action is not confined to or associated 
with a unique line in space. For example, if a body moves without rota­
tion, then the movement or displacement of any point in the body may 
be taken as a vector. This vector describes equally well the direction and 
magnitude of the displacement of every point in the body. Thus, we may 
represent the displacement of such a body by a free vector. 
A sliding vector has a unique line of action in space but not a unique 
point of application. For example, when an external force acts on a rigid 
body, the force can be applied at any point along its line of action without 
changing its effect on the body as a whole,* and thus it is a sliding vector. 
A fixed vector is one for which a unique point of application is speci­
fied. The action of a force on a deformable or nonrigid body must be speci­
fied by a fixed vector at the point of application of the force. In this 
instance the forces and deformations within the body depend on the point 
of application of the force, as well as on its magnitude and line of action. 
Conventions for Equations and Diagrams 
A vector quantity V is represented by a line segment, Fig. 111, hav­
ing the direction of the vector and having an arrowhead to indicate the 
sense. The length of the directed line segment represents to some conve­
nient scale the magnitude lVI of the vector, which is printed with light­
face italic type V. For example, we may choose a scale such that an 
arrow one inch long represents a force of twenty pounds. 
In scalar equations, and frequently on diagrams where only the mag­
nitude of a vector is labeled, the symbol will appear in lightface italic 
type. Boldface type is used for vector quantities whenever the directional 
aspect of the vector is a part of its mathematical representation. When 
writing vector equations, always be certain to pre erve the matb.ematical 
distinction between vectors and scalars. In handwritten work, use a dis­
tinguishing mark for eaQ! vector quantity, such as an underline, I, or an 
arrow over the symbol, V, to take the place of boldface type in print. 
Working with Vectors 
The direction of the vector V may be measured by an angle (} from 
some known reference direction as shown in Fig. 111. The negative of V 
7is is the principle of transmissibility, which is discussed in Art. 2/2.

Figure 1/3 
Figure 1/2 
is a vector -V having the same magnitude as V but directed in the 
sense opposite to V, as shown in Fig. 111. 
Vectors must obey the parallelogram law of combination. This law 
states that two vectors VI and V2, treated as free vectors, Fig. l/2a, may 
be replaced by their equivalent vector V, which is the diagonal of the 
parallelogram formed by V1 and V2 as its two sides, as shown in Fig. 112b. 
This combination is called the vector sum and is represented by the 
vector equation 
where the plus sign, when used with the vector quantities (in boldface 
type), means vector and not scalar addition. The scalar sum of the mag­
nitudes of the two vectors is written in the usual way as V1 + V2• The 
geometry of the parallelogram shows that v # v. + v2. 
The two vectors V 1 and V 2, again treated as free vectors, may also be 
added head-to-tail by the triangle law, as shown in Fig. 112c, to obtain the 
identical vector sum V. We se from the diagram that the order of addi­
tion of the vectors does not affect their sum, so that V1 + V2 = V2 + V1• 
The difference V1 - V2 between the two vectors is easily obtained 
by adding -v2 to v1 as shown in Fig. 113, where either the triangle or 
parallelogram procedure may be used. The difference V' between the 
two vectors is expressed by the vector equation 
where the minus sign denotes vector subtraction. 
Any two or more vectors whose sum equals a certain vector V are 
aid to be the components of that vector. Thus, the vectors VI and V2 in 
Fig. 1/4a are the components ofV in the directions 1 and 2, respectively. 
It is usually most convenient to deal with vector components which are 
mutually perpendicular; these are called rectangular components. The

vectors V., and Vy in Fig. l/4b are the x- andy-components, respectively, of 
V. Likewise, in Fig. 1/4c, V :r and V y' are the x'- and y' -oomponents of V. 
When expressed in rectangular components, the direction of the vector 
with respect to, say, the x-axis is clearly specified by the angle 0, where 
v: 
fJ = tan -l 2 
Vx 
A vector V may be expressed mathematically by multiply ing its 
magnitude V by a vector n whose magnitude is one and whose direction 
coincides with that ofV. The vector n is called a unit vector. Thus, 
V=Vn 
In this way both the magnitude and direction of the vector are conve­
niently contained in one mathematical expression. In many problems, 
particularly three-dimensional ones, it is convenient to express the rect­
angular components of V, Fig. 1/5, in terms of unit vectors i, j, and k, 
which are vectors in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively, with unit 
magnitudes. Because the vector V is the vector sum of the components in 
the x-,y-, and z-directions, we can express V as follows: 
We now make use of the direction cosines l, m, and n ofV, which are de­
fined by 
l =cos 8., 
m =cos By 
Thus, we may write the magnitudes of the components of V as 
Vy= mV 
where, from the Pythagorean theorem, 
Note that this relation implies that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1.

NEWTON'S LAWS 
Sir Isaac 
ewton was the first to state correctly the basic laws gov­
erning the motion of a particle and to demonstrate their validity.* 
Slightly reworded with modem terminology, these laws are: 
Law I. A particle remains at rest or continues to move with uniform 
velocity (in a straight line with a constant speed) if there is no unbal­
anced force acting on it. 
*Newton's original formulations may be found in the translation of his Principia (1687) 
revised by F. Cajori, University of California Press, 1934.

Intro d uction to Statics 
Law II. The acceleration of a particle is proportional to the vector 
sum of forces acting on it and is in the direction of this vector sum. 
Law Il. The forces of action and reaction between interacting bod­
ies are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear (they lie 
on the same line). 
The correctness of these laws has been verified by innumerable ac­
curate physical measurements. Newton's second law forms the basis 
for most of the analysis in dynamics. As applied to a particle of mass m, 
it may be stated as 
{1/1) 
where F is the vector sum of forces acting on the particle and a is the re­
sulting acceleration. This equation is a vector equation because the di­
rection ofF must agree with the direction of a, and the magnitudes ofF 
and ma must be equal. 
Newton's first law contains the principle of the equilibrium of 
forces, which is the main topic of concern in statics. This law is actually 
a consequence of the second law, since there is no acceleration when the 
force is zero, and tbe particle either is at rest or is moving with a uni­
form velocity. The first law adds nothing new to the description of mo­
tion but is included here because it was part of Newton's classical 
statements. 
The third law is basic to our understanding of force. It states that 
forces always occur in pairs of equal and opposite forces. Thus, the 
downward force exerted on the desk by the pencil is acompanied by an 
upward force of equal magnitude exerted on the pencil by tbe desk. This 
principle holds for all forces, variable or constant, regardless of their 
source, and holds at every instant of time during which the forces are 
applied. Lack of careful attention to this basic law is the cause of fre­
quent error by the beginner. 
In the analysis of bodies under the action of forces, it is absolutely 
necessary to be clear about which force of each action-reaction pair is 
being considered. It is necessary first of all to isolate the body under con­
sideration and then to consider only the one force of the pair which acts 
on the body in question.

UNITS 
In mechanics we use four fundamental quantities called dimensions. 
These are length, mass, force, and time. The units used to measure these 
quantities cannot all be chosen independently because they must be con­
sistent with Newton's second law, Eq. 111. Although there are a number 
of different systems of units, only the two systems most commonly used 
in science and technology wil be used in this text. The four fundamental 
dimensions and their units and symbols in the two systems are suma­
rized in the following table.

The International System of Units, abbreviated SI (from the 
French, Systeme International d'Unites), is accepted in the United 
States and throughout the world, and is a modern version of the metric 
system. By international agreement, SI units will in time replace other 
systems. As shown in the table, in SI, the units kilogram (kg) for mass, 
meter (m) for length, and second (s) for time are selected as the base 
units, and the newton (N) for force is derived from the preceding three 
by Eq. 1/1. Thus, force (N) = mass (kg) X acceleration {m/s2) or 
N = kg·mls2 
Thus, 1 newton is the force required to give a mass of 1 kg an accelera­
tion of 1 m/s2• 
C onsider a body of mass m which is allowed to fall freely near the 
surface of the earth. With only the force of gravitation acting on the 
body, it falls with an acceleration g toward the center of the earth. This 
gravitational force is the weight W of the body and is found from Eq. 1/1: 
W(N) = m(kg) X g(m/s2) 
U.S. Customary Units 
The U.S. customary, or British system of units, also called the foot­
pound-seoond (FPS) system, has been the common system in business 
and industry in English-speaking countries. Although this system will 
in time be replaced by SI units, for many more years engineers must be 
able to work with both SI units and FPS units. 
As shown in the table, in the U.S. or FPS system, the units of feet 
(ft) for length, seconds (sec) for time, and pounds (lb) for force are se­
lected as base units, and the slug for mass is derived from Eq. 111. Thus, 
force (lb) = mass (slugs) X acceleration (ft/sec2), or 
1 
lb-sec2 
s ug= -ft
-
Therefore, 1 slug is the mass which is given an acceleration of 1 ftJsea2 
when acted on by a force of 1lb. IfW is the gravitational force or weight 
andg is the acceleration due to gravity, Eq.l/1 gives 
W(lb) 
m (slugs) =

The standard kilo gram 
Note that seconds is abbreviated as s in SI units, and as sec in FPS 
units. 
In U.S. units the pound is also used on occasion as a unit of mass, 
especially to specify thermal properties of liquids and gases. When dis­
tinction between the two units is necessary, the force unit is frequently 
written as lbf and the mass unit as Ibm. In this book we use almost ex­
clusively the force unit, which is written simply as lb. Other common 
units of force in the U.S. system are the kilo pound (kip), which equals 
1000 lb, and the ton, which equals 2000 lb. 
The International System ofUnits (SD is termed an absolute system 
because the measurement of the base quantity mass is independent of 
its environment. On the other hand, the U.S. system (FPS) is termed a 
gravitational system because its base quantity force is defined as the 
gravitational attraction (weight) acting on a standard mass under speci­
fied conditions (sea level and 45° latitude). A standard pound is also the 
force required to give a one-pound mass an acceleration of 32.1740 
ftlsec2• 
In SI units the kilogram is used exclusively as a unit of mass-never 
force. In the MKS (meter, kilogram, second) gravitational system, which 
has been used for many years in non-English-speaking countries, the 
kilogram, like the pound, has been used both as a unit of force and as a 
unit of mass. 
Primary Standards 
Primary standards for the measurements of mass, length, and time 
have been established by international agreement and are as follows: 
Mass. The kilogram is defined as the mass of a specific platinum­
iridium cylinder which is kept at the International Bureau ofWeights 
and Measures near Paris, France. An accurate copy of this cylinder is 
kept in the United States at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), formerly the National Bureau of Standards, and 
serves as the standard of mass for the United States. 
Length. The meter, originally defined as one ten-millionth of the 
distance from the pole to the equator along the meridian through Paris, 
was later defined as the length of a specific platinum-iridium bar kept at 
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The difficulty of ac­
cessing the bar and reproducing accurate measurements prompted the 
adoption of a more accurate and reproducible standard of length for the 
meter, which is now defined as 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of a specific ra­
diation of the krypton-86 atom. 
Time. The second was originally defined as the fraction 11(86 400) 
of the mean solar day. However, irregularities in the earth's rotation led 
to difficulties with this definition, and a more accurate and reproducible 
standard has been adopted. The seoond is now defined as the duration of 
9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation of a specific state of the cesium-
133 atom. 
For most engineering work, and for our purpose in studying 
mechanics, the accuracy of these standards is considerably beyond 

our needs. The standard value for gravitational acceleration g is 
its value at sea level and at a 45° latitude. In the two systems these 
values are 
SI units 
U .S. units 
g = 9.806 65 m/s2 
g = 32. 1740 ft/sec2 
The approximate values of 9.81 m/s2 and 32.2 ft/sec2, respectively, are 
sufficiently accurate for the vast majority of engineering calculations. 
Unit Conversions 
The characteristics of SI units are shown inside the front cover of 
this book, along with the numerical conversions between U.S. custom­
ary and SI units. In addition, charts giving the approximate conversions 
between selected quantities in the two systems appear inside the back 
cover for convenient reference. Although these charts are useful for ob­
taining a feel for the relative size ofSI and U.S. units, in time engineers 
will find it essential to think directly in terms of SI units without con­
verting from U.S. units. In statics we are primarily concerned with the 
units of length and force, with mass needed only when we compute grav­
itational force, as explained previously. 
Figure 1/6 depicts examples of force, mass, and length in the two 
systems of units, to aid in visualizing their relative magnitudes.

LAW OF GRAVITATION 
In statics as well as dynamics we often need to compute the weight 
of a body, which is the gravitational force acting on it. This computation 
depends on the law of gravitation, which was also formulated by New­
ton. The law of gravitation is expressed by the equation 
(112) 
where F = the mutual force of attraction between two particles 
G = a universal constant known as the constant of gravitation 
mi> m2 =the masses of the two particles 
r =the distance between the centers oftbe particles 
The mutual forces F obey the law of action and reaction, since they are 
equal and opposite and are directed along the line joining the centers of 
the particles, as shown in Fig. 117. By experiment the gravitational con­
stant is found to beG= 6.673(10-11) m3/(kg·s2). 
Gravitational Attraction of the Earth 
Gravitational forces exist between every pair of bodies. On the sur­
face of the earth the only gravitational force of appreciable magnitude 
is the force due to the attraction of the earth. For example, each of two 
iron spheres 100 mm in diameter's attracted to tbe earth with a gravi­
tational force of 37.1 N, which is its weight. On the other hand, the 
force of mutual attraction between the spheres if they are just touching 
is 0.000 000 095 1 N. This force is clearly negligible compared with the 
earth's attraction of 37.1 N. Consequently the gravitational attraction 
of the earth is the only gravitational force we need to consider for most 
engineering applications on the earth's surface. 
The gravitational attraction of the earth on a body (its weight) 
exists whether the body is at rest or in motion. Because this attrac­
tion is a force, the weight of a body should be expressed in newtons 
(N) in SI units and in pounds (lb) in U.S. customary units. Unfortu­
nately, in common practice the mass unit kilogram (kg) has been fre­
quently used as a measure of weight. This usage should disappear in 
time as SI units become more widely used, because in SI units the 
kilogram is used exclusively for mass and the newton is used for 
force, including weight. 
For a body of mass m near the surface of the earth, the gravitational 
attraction F on the body is specified by Eq. 112. We usually denote the

magnitude of this gravitational force or weight with the symbol W. Be­
cause the body falls with an acceleration g, Eq. 1/1 gives 
(113) 
The weight W will be in newtons (N) when the mass m is in kilograms 
(kg) and the acceleration of gravity g is in meters per second squared 
(m/s2). In U.S. customary units, the weight W will be in pounds (lb) 
when m is in slugs andg is in feet per second squared. The standard val­
ues for g of 9.81 m/s2 and 32.2 ft/sec2 will be sufficiently accurate for our 
calculations in statics. 
The true weight (gravitational attraction) and the apparent weight 
(as measured by a spring scale) are slightly different. The difference, 
which is due to the rotation of the earth, is quite small and wil be ne­
glected. This effect will be discussed in Vol. 2 Dynamics. 
1/7 AccuRACY, LIMITS, AND APPROXIMATIONS 
The number of significant figures in an answer should be no 
greater than the number of figures justified by the accuracy of the 
given data. For example, suppose the 24-mm side of a square bar was 
measured to the nearest millimeter, so we know the side length to two 
significant figures. Squaring the side length gives an area of 576 mm2• 
However, according to our rule, we should write the area as 580 mm2, 
using only two significant figures. 
When calculations involve small differences in large quantities, 
greater accuracy in the data is required to achieve a given accuracy in 
the results. Thus, for example, it is necessary to know the numbers 
4.2503 and 4.2391 to an accuracy of five significant figures to express 
their difference 0.0112 to three-figure accuracy. It is often difficult in 
lengthy computations to know at the outset how many significant fig­
ures are needed in the original data to ensure a certain accuracy in the 
answer. Accuracy to three significant figures 's considered satisfactory 
for most engineering calculations. 
In this text, answers wil generally be shown to three significant fig­
ures unless the answer begins with the digit 1, in which case the answer 
wiH be shown to four significant figures. For purposes of calculation, 
consider all data given in this book to be exact. 
Differentials 
The order of differential quantities frequently causes misunder­
standing in the derivation of equations. Higher-order differentials may 
always be neglected compared with lower-order differentials when the 
mathematical limit is approached. For example, the element of volume 
!1 V of a right circular cone of altitude h and base radius r may be taken 
to be a circular slice a distance x from the vertex and of thickness !1x. 
The expression for the volume of the element is

Note that, when passing to the limit in going from 6. V to dV and from 
6.x to dx, the terms containing (6.x)2 and (t:.x)8 drop out, leaving merely 
which gives an exact expression when integrated. 
Small-Angle Approximations 
When dealing with small angles, we can usually make use of simpli­
fying approximations. Consider the right triangle of Fig. 1/8 where the 
angle 0, expressed in radians, is relatively small. If the hypotenuse is 
unity, we see from the geometry of the figure that the arc length 1 X 8 
and sin 9 are very nearly the same. Also, cos () is close to unity. Further­
more, sin 8 and tan 0 have alm.ost the same values. Thus, for small an­
gles we may write 
sinOs.tanOs.O 
cosOs. 1 
provided that the angles are expressed in radians. These approximations 
may be obtained by retaining only the first terms in the series expan­
sions for these three functions. As an example of these approximations, 
for an angle of 1 o 
r = 0.017 453 rad 
in r = 0.017 452 
tan 1° = 0.017 455 
cos 1° = 0.999 848 
If a more accurate approximation is desired, the first two terms may 
be retained, and they are 
where the angles must be expressed in radians. (To convert degrees to 
radians, multiply the angle in degrees by 7T/180°.) The error in replac­
ing the sine by the angle for r (0.0175 rad) is only 0.005 percent. For 5° 
(0.0873 rad) the error is 0.13 percent, and for 10° (0.1745 rad), the error 
is still only 0.51 percent. As the angle 9 approaches zero, the following 
relations are true in the mathematical limit: 
sin dO = tan dO = dO 
cos dO= 1 
where the differential angle dO must be expressed in radians.

PROBLEM SOLVING IN STATICS 
We study statics to obtain a quantitative description of forces which 
act on engineering structures in equilibrium. Mathematics establishes 
the relations between the various quantities involved and enables us to 
predict effects from these relations. We use a dual thought process in 

Arti cle 1/8 Problem S o lvi ng in Statics 15 
solving statics problems: We think about both the physical situation and 
the corresponding mathematical description. In the analysis of every 
problem, we make a transition between the physical and the mathemat­
ical. One of the most important goals for the student is to develop the 
ability to make this transition freely. 
Making Appropriate Assumptions 
We should recognize that the mathematical formulation of a 
physical problem represents an ideal description, or model, which ap­
proximates but never quite matches the actual physical situation. 
When we construct an idealized mathematical model for a given engi­
neering problem, certain approximations will always be involved. 
Some of these approximation may be mathematical, whereas others 
will be physical. 
For instance, it is often necessary to neglect small distances, angles, 
or forces compared with large distances, angles, or forces. Suppose a 
force is distributed over a small area of the body on which it acts. We 
may consider it to be a concentrated force if the dimensions of the area 
involved are small compared with other pertinent dimensions. 
We may neglect the weight of a steel cable if the tension in the cable 
is many times greater than its total weight. However, if we must calcu­
late the deflection or sag of a suspended cable under the action of its 
weight, we may not ignore the cable weight. 
Thus, what we may assume depends on what information is desired 
and on the accuracy required. We must be constantly alert to the various 
assumptions called for in the formulation of real problems. The ability to 
understand and make use of tbe appropriate assumptions in the formula­
tion and solution of engineering problems is certainly one of the most im­
portant characteristics of a successful engineer. One of the mE.\ior aims of 
this book is to provide many opportunities to develop this ability through 
the formulation and analysis of many practical problems involving the 
principles of statics. 
Using Graphics 
Graphics is an important analytical tool for three reasons: 
1. We use graphics to represent a physical system on paper with a 
sketch or diagram. Representing a problem geometrically helps us 
with its physical interpretation, especially when we must visualize 
three-dimensional problems. 
2. We can often obtain a graphical solution to problems more easily 
than with a direct mathematical solution. Graphical solutions are 
both a practical way to obtain results and an aid in our thought 
processes. Because graphics represents the physical situation and 
its mathematical expression simultaneously, graphics helps us make 
the transition between the two. 
8. Charts or graphs are valuable aids for representing results in a 
form which is easy to understand. 

16 C h a pt e r  1 
I nt r o d u c t i o n  to Statics 
fORMULATI NG PROBLEMS AND OBTAI NI NG SOLUTI ONS 
In statics, as in all engineering problems, we need to use a preci e and 
logical method for formulating problems and obtaining their solutions. 
We formulate each problem and develop its solution through the follow­
ing sequence of steps. 
1. Formulate the problem: 
(a) State the given data. 
(b) State the desired result. 
(c) State your assumptions and approximations. 
2. Develop the solution: 
(a) Draw any diagrams you need to understand the relationships. 
(b) State the governing principles to be applied to your solution. 
(c) Make your calculations. 
(d) Ensure that your calculations are consistent with the accuracy 
justified by the data. 
(e) Be sure that you have used consistent units throughout your 
calculations. 
(f) Ensure that your answers are reasonable in terms of magni­
tudes, directions, common sense, etc. 
(g) Draw conclusions. 
Keeping your work neat and orderly will help your thought process and 
enable others to understand your work. The discipline of doing orderly 
work will help you develop skill in formulation and analysis. Problems 
which seem complicated at first often become clear when you approach 
them with logic and discipline. 
The Free-Body Diagram 
The subject of statics is based on surprisingly few fundamental con­
cepts and involves mainly the application of these basic relations to a 
variety of situations. In this application the method of analysis is all 
important. In solving a problem, it is essential that the laws which apply 
be carefully fixed in mind and that we apply these principles literally 
and exactly. In applying the principles of mechanics to analyze forces 
acting on a body, it is essential that we isolate the body in question from 
al other bodies so that a complete and accurate account of all forces act­
ing on this body can be taken. This isolation should exist mentally and 
should be represented on paper. The diagram of such an isolated body 
with the representation of all external forces acting on it is called a free­
body diagram. 
The free-body-diagram method is the key to the understanding of 
mechanics. This is o because the isolation of a body is the tool by which 

Arti cle 1/8 Problem S o lvi ng in Statics 17 
cause and effect are clearly separated and by which our attention is 
clearly focused on the literal application of a principle of mechanics. The 
technique of drawing free-body diagrams is covered in Chapter 3, where 
they are first used. 
Numerical Values versus Symbols 
In applying the laws of statics, we may use numerical values to 
represent quantities, or we may use algebraic symbols and leave the 
answer as a formula. When numerical values are used, the magnitude 
of each quantity expressed in its particular units is evident at each 
stage of the calculation. This is useful when we need to know the mag­
nitude of each term. 
The symbolic solution, however, has several advantages over the 
numerical solution. First, the use of symbols helps to focus our atten­
tion on the connection between the physical situation and its related 
mathematical description. Second, we can use a symbolic solution re­
peatedly for obtaining answers to the same type of problem, but hav­
ing different units or numerical values. Third, a symbolic solution 
enables us to make a dimensional check at every step, which is more 
difficult to do when numerical values are used. In any equation repre­
senting a physical situation, the dimensions of every term on both 
sides of the equation must be the same. This property is called dimen­
sional hom\geneity. 
Thus, facility with both numerical and symbolic forms of solution is 
essential. 
Solution Methods 
Solutions to the problems of statics may be obtained in one or more 
of the following ways. 
1. Obtain mathematical solutions by hand, using either algebraic 
symbols or numerical values. We can solve most problems this 
way. 
2. Obtain graphical solutions for certain problems. 
3. Solve problems by computer. This is useful when a large number 
of equations must be solved, when a parameter variation must be 
studied, or when an intractable equation must be solved. 
Many problems can be solved with two or more of these methods. The 
method utilized depends partly on the engineer's preference and partly 
on the type of problem to be solved. The choice of the most expedient 
method of solution is an important aspect of the experience to be gained 
from the problem work. There are a number of problems in Vol. 1 Stat­
ics which are designated as Computer-Oriented Problems. These prob­
lems appear at the end of the Review Problem sets and are selected to 
illustrate the type of problem for which solution by computer offers a 
distinct advantage.

Solution. From relationship 1/3, we have 
A rticle 1/9 
Chapter Review 19 
m= 1400kg 
W = mg = 1400(9.81) = 13 7 30 N 
Ans. 
Helpful Hints 
From the table of conversion factors inside the front cover of the textbook, we 
see that 1 slug is equal to 14.594 kg. Thus, the mass of the car in slugs is 
[ 1 slug ] 
m = 14{)0 kg 
14.594 kg 
= 95.9 slugs 
Ans. 
Finally, its weight in pounds is 
W = mg = (95.9)(32.2) = 3090 lb 
Ans. 
As another route to the last result, we can convert from kg to lbm. Again using 
the table inside the front cover, we have 
[ 
1 lbm J 
m "' 1400 kg 
0.45359 kg "' 3090 lbm 
The weight in pounds associated with the mass of 3090 Ibm is 3090 lb, as calcu­
lated above. We recall that 1 Ibm is the amount of mass which under standard 
conditions bas a weight of 1 lb of force. We rarely refer to the U.S. mass unit 
lbm in this textbok series, but rather use the slug for mass. The sole use of 
slug, rather than the unnecessary use of two units for mass, will prove to be 
powerful and simple-especially in dynamics. 
CD Our calculator indicates a result of 
13 734 N. Using the rules of significant­
figure display used in this textbook, 
we round the written result to four 
significant figures, or 1 3  7 30 N. Had 
the number begun with any digit 
other than 1, we would have rounded 
to three significant figures. 
Ċ A god practice with unit conversion 
is to multiply by a factor such as 
[ 1 slug J 
14.594 kg 
, which has a value of 1, 
because the numerator and the de­
nominator are equivalent. Make sure 
that cancellation of the units leaves 
the units desired; here the units of 
kg cancel, leaving the desired units 
of slug. 
@ Note that we are using a previously calculated result (95.9 slugs). We must be sure that when a calculated number is 
needed in subsequent calculations, it is retained in the calculator to its full accuracy, (95.929834 . . .  ), until it is needed. 
This may require storing it in a register upon its initial calculation and recalling it later. We must not merely punch 
95.9 into our calculator and proceed to multiply by 32.2--this practice will result in loss of numerical accuracy. Some 
individuals like to place a small indication of the storage register used in the right margin of the work paper, directly 
beside the number stored.

Helpful Hint 
The discrepancy is due to the fact that Newton's universal gravitational law does 
not take into account the rotation of the earth. On the other hand, the value g = 
9.81 m/s2 used in the second equation does account for the earth's rotation. Note 
that had we used the more accurate valueg = 9.80665 m/s2 (which likewise ac­
c<Junts for the earth's rotation) in the second equation, the discrepancy would 
have been larger (686 N would have ben the result). 
CD The effective distance between the 
mass centers of the two bodies in­
volved is the radius of the earth.

INTRODUCTION 
In this and the following chapters, we study the effects of forces 
which act on engineering structures and mechanisms. The experience 
gained here will help you in the study of mechanics and in other sub­
jects such as stress analysis, design of structures and machines, and 
fluid flow. This chapter lays the foundation for a basic understanding 
not only of statics but also of the entire subject of mechanics, and you 
should master this material thoroughly.

fORCE 
Before dealing with a group or system of forces, it is necessary to ex­
amine the properties of a single force in some detail. A force has been 
defined in Chapter 1 as an action of one body on another. In dynamics we 
will see that a force is defined as an action which tends to cause acceler­
ation of a body. A force is a vector quantity, because its effect depends on 
the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action. Thus, forces may 
be combined according to the parallelogram law of vector addition.

(a) 
The action of the cable tension on the bracket in Fig. 2/la is repre­
sented in the side view, Fig. 2/lb, by the force vector P of magnitude P. 
The effect of this action on the bracket depends on P, the angle 8, and 
the location of the point of application A. Changing any one of these 
three specifications wil alter the effect on the bracket, such as the force 
in one of the bolts which secure the bracket to the base, or the internal 
force and deformation in the material of the bracket at any point. Thus, 
the complete specification of the action of a force must include its mag­
nitude, direction, and point of application, and therefore we must treat 
Cable tension 
it as a fixed vector.

The forces associated with this lift· 
ing rig must be carefully identified, 
classified, and analyzed in order to 
provide a safe and effective working 
environment. 
External and Internal Effects 
We can separate the action of a force on a body into two effects, exter­
nal and internal. For the bracket of Fig. 2/1 the effects ofP external to the 
bracket are the reactive forces (not shown) exerted on the bracket by the 
foundation and bolts because of the action of P. Forces external to a body 
can be either applied forces or reactive forces. The effects of P internal to 
the bracket are the resulting internal forces and deformations distributed 
throughout the material of the bracket. The relation between internal 
forces and internal deformati.ons depends on the material properties of 
the body and is studied in strength of materials, elasticity, and plasticity. 
Principle of Transmissibility 
When dealing with the mechanics of a rigid body, we ignore defor­
mations in the body and concern ourselves with only the net external ef­
fects of external forces. In such cases, experience shows us that it is not 
necessary to restrict the action of an applied force to a given point. For 
example, the force P acting on the rigid plate in Fig. 2/2 may be applied 
at A or at B or at any other point on its line of action, and the net exter­
nal effects of P on the bracket will not change. The external effects are 
the force exerted on the plate by the bearing support at 0 and the force 
exerted on the plate by the roller support at C. 
This conclusion is summarized by the principle of transmissibility, 
which states that a force may be applied at any point on its given line of 
action without altering the resultant effects of the force external to the 
rigid body on which it acts. Thus, whenever we are interested in only 
the resultant external effects of a force, the force may be treated as a 
sliding vector, and we need specify only the magnitude, direction, and 
line of action of the force, and not its point of application. Because this 
book deals essentially with the mechanics of rigid bodies, we will treat 
almost al forces as sliding vectors for the rigid body on which they act. 
Force Classification 
Forces are classified as either contact or body forces. A contact force is 
produced by direct physical contact; an example is the force exerted on a 
body by a supporting surface. On the other hand, a body force is generated 
by virtue of the position of a body within a force field such as a gravita­
tional, electric, or magnetic field. An example of a body force is your weight. 
Forces may be further classified as either concentrated or distrib­
uted. Every contact force is actually applied over a finite area and is 

therefore really a distributed force. However, when the dimensions of 
the area are very small compared with the other dimensions of the body, 
we may consider the force to be concentrated at a point with negligible 
loss of accuracy. Force can be distributed over an area, as in the case of 
mechanical contact, over a volume when a body force such as weight is 
acting, or over a line, as in the case of the weight of a suspended cable. 
The weight of a body is the force of gravitational attraction distrib­
uted over its volume and may be taken as a concentrated force acting 
through the center of gravity. The position of the center of gravity is fre­
quently obvious if the body is symmetric. If the position is not obvious, 
then a separate calculation, explained in Chapter 5, will be necessary to 
locate the center of gravity. 
We can measure a force either by comparison with other known forces, 
using a mechanical balance, or by the calibrated movement of an elasti.c 
element. All such comparisons or calibrations have as their basis a pri­
mary standard. The standard unit of force in SI units is the newton (N) 
and in the U.S. customary system is the pound (lb), as defined in Art. 1/5. 
Action and Reaction 
According to Newton's third law, the action of a force is always ac­
companied by an equal and opposite reaction. It is essential to distin­
guish between the action and the reaction in a pair of forces. To do so, 
we first isolate the body in question and then identify the force exerted 
on that body (not the force exerted by the body). It is very easy to mis­
takenly use the wrong force of the pair unless we distinguish carefuly 
between action and reaction. 
Concurrent Forces 
Two or more forces are said to be concurrent at a point if their lines 
of action intersect at that point. The forces F 1 and F 2 shown in Fig. 2/3a 
have a common point of application and are concurrent at the point A. 
Thus, they can be added using the parallelogram law in their common 
plane to obtain their sum or resultant R, as shown in Fig. 213a. The re­
sultant lies in the same plane as F 1 and F 2• 
Suppose the two concurrent forces lie in the same plane but are ap­
plied at two different points as in Fig. 213b. By the principle of transmis­
sibility, we may move them along their lines of action and complete 
their vector sum R at the point of concurrency A, as shown in Fig. 213b. 
We can replace F1 and F2 with the resultant R without altering the ex­
ternal effects on the body upon which they act. 
We can also use the triangle law to obtain R, but we need to move 
the line of action of one of the forces, as shown in Fig. 213c. If we add the 
same two forces as shown in Fig. 213d, we correctly preserve the magni­
tude and direction of R, but we lose the correct line of action, because R 
obtained in this way does not pass through A. Therefore this type of 
combination should be avoided. 
We can express the sum of the two forces mathematically by the 
vector equation

Vector Components 
In addition to combining forces to obtain their resultant, we often 
need to replace a force by its vector components in directions which are 
convenient for a given application. The vector sum of the components 
must equal the original vector. Thus, the force R in Fig. 2/3a may be re­
placed by, or resolved into, two vector components F1 and F2 with the 
specified directions by completing the parallelogram as shown to obtain 
the magnitudes ofF1 and F2. 
The relationship between a force and its vector components along 
given axes must not be confused with the relationship between a force 
and its perpendicular* projections onto the same axes. Figure 2/3e 
shows the perpendicular projections Fa and F 11 of the given force R onto 
axes a and b, which are parallel to the vector components F1 and F2 of 
Fig. 2/Sa. Figure 2/Se shows that the components of a vector are not nec­
essarily equal to the projections of the vector onto the same axes. Fur­
thermore, the vector sum of the projections Fa and Fb is not the vector 
R, because the parallelogram law of vector addition must be used to 
form the sum. The components and projections of R are equal only 
when the axes a and b are perpendicular. 
A Special Case of Vector Addition 
To obtain the resultant when the two forces F1 and F2 are parallel 
as in Fig. 2/4, we use a special case of addition. The two vectors are com­
bined by first adding two equal, opposite, and collinear forces F and -F 
of convenient magnitude, which taken together produce no external ef­
fect on the body. Adding F1 and F to produce Rl> and combining with the 
sum Ȉ of F 2 and -F yield the resultant R, which is correct in mag­
nitude, direction, and line of action. This procedure is also useful for 
graphically combining two forces which have a remote and inconvenient 
point of concurrency because they are almost parallel. 
It is usually helpful to master the analysis of force systems in two 
dimensions before undertaking three-dimensional analysis. Thus the re­
mainder of Chapter 2 is subdivided into th.ese two categories. 
SECTION A TWO-DIMENSIONAL FORCE SYSTEMS 
2/3 
R ECTANGULA R  COMPONENTS 
The most common two-dimensional resolution of a force vector is 
into rectangular components. It follows from the parallelogram rule 
that the vector F of Fig. 2/5 may be written as 
(21) 
where F:x and F, are vector components of F in the x- andy-directions. 
Each of the two vector components may be written as a scalar tinles the 
*Perpendicular projections are also called orthogoTUll projections. 

Article 2/3 Recta n g u l a r  C o m ponents 27 
appropriate unit vector. In terms of the unit vectors i and j of Fig. 2/5, 
F:r = F,i and F1 = F1j, and thus we may write 
(212) 
where the scalars F, and F1 are the x and y scalar components of the 
vector F. 
The scalar components can be positive or negative, depending on 
the quadrant into which F points. For the force vector of Fig. 2/5, the x 
andy scalar components are both positive and are related to the magni­
tude and direction ofF by 
F, = F cos 8 
F1 = F sin 8 
F = 
F,2 + F:/ 
Fy 
8 = tan-1-

Conventions for Describing Vector Components 
(213) 
We express the magnitude of a vector with lightface italic type in 
print; that is, IFI is indicated by F, a quantity which is always nonnega­
tive. However, the scalar components, also denoted by lightface italic 
type, will include sign information. See Sample Problems 2/1 and 2/S for 
numerical examples which involve both positive and negative scalar 
components. 
When both a force and its vector components appear in a diagram, 
it is desirable to show the vector components of the force with dashed 
lines, as in Fig. 2/5, and show the force with a solid line, or vice versa. 
With either of these conventions it will always be clear that a force and 
its components are being represented, and not three separate forces, as 
would be implied by three solid-line vectors. 
Actual problems do not come with reference axes, so their assign­
ment is a matter of arbitrary convenience, and the choice is frequently 
up to the student. The logical choice is usually indicated by the way in 
which the geometry of the problem is specified. When the principal di­
mensions of a body are given in the horizontal and vertical directions, for 
example, you would typically assign reference axes in these directions. 
Determining the Components of a Force 
Dimensions are not always given in horizontal and vertical direc­
tions, angles need not be measured counterclockwise from the x-axis, 
and the origin of coordinates need not be on the line of action of a force. 
Therefore, it is essential that we be able to determine the correct com­
ponents of a force no matter how the axes are oriented or how the an­
gles are measured. Figure 216 suggests a few typical examples of vector 
resolution in two dimensions. 
Memorization of Eqs. 2/3 is not a substitute for understanding the 
parallelogram law and for correctly projecting a vector onto a reference 
axis. A neatly drawn sketch always helps to clarifY the geometry and 
avoid error.

The structural elements in the fore­
ground transmit concentrated forces 
to the brackets at both ends. 
Rectangular components are convenient for finding the sum or re­
sultant R of two forces which are concurrent. Consider two forces F1 
and F2 which are originally concurrent at a point 0. Figure 217 shows 
the line of action of F2 shifted from 0 to the tip of F1 according to the 
triangle rule of Fig. 2/3. In adding the force vectors F 1 and F 2, we may 
write 
or 
from which we conclude that 
R,. = F1. + F2, = ¥.Fx 
Ry = F1, + F2, = ¥.Fy 
(214) 
The term ¥.F" means "the algebraic sum of the x scalar components". 
For the example shown in Fig. 217, note that the scalar component F2, 
would be negative.

MOMENT 
In addition to the tendency to move a body in the direction of its ap­
plication, a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis. The axis 
may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the line of ac­
tion of the force. This rotational tendency is known as the moment M of 
the force. Moment is also referred t{) as torque. 
As a familiar example of the concept of moment, consider the pipe 
wrench of Fig. 2/Ba. One effect of the force applied perpendicular to 
the handle of the wrench is the tendency to rotate the pipe about its 
vertical axis. The magnitude of this tendency depends on both the 
magnitude F of the force and the effective length d of the wrench 
handle. Common experience shows that a pull which is not perpendic­
ular to the wrench handle is less effective than the right-angle pull 
shown. 
Moment about a Point 
Figure 2/Bb shows a two-dimensional body acted on by a force F in 
its plane. The magnitude of the moment or tendency of the force to ro­
tate the body about the axis 0-0 perpendicular to the plane of the 
body is proportional both to the magnitude of the force and to the mo­
ment arm d, which is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the 
line of action of the force. Therefore, the magnitude of the moment is 
defined as 
(2/5) 
The moment is a vector M perpendicular to the plane of the body. The 
sense of M depends on the direction in which F tends to rotate the 
body. The right-hand rule, Fig. 2/Bc, is used to identify this sense. We 
represent the moment ofF about 0-0 as a vector pointing in the direc­
tion of the thumb, with the fingers curled in the direction of the rota­
tional tendency. 
The moment M obeys all the rules of vector combination and 
may be considered a sliding vector with a line of action coinciding 
with the moment axis. The basic units of moment in SI units are 
newton-meters (N·m), and in the U.S. customary system are pound­
feet Ob-ft). 
When dealing with forces which al act in a given plane, we custom­
arily speak of the moment about a point. By this we mean the moment 
with respect to an axis normal to the plane and passing through the 
point. Thus, the moment of force F about point A in Fig. 2/Bd has the 
magnitude M = Fd and is counterclockwise. 
Moment directions may be accounted for by using a stated sign con­
vention, such as a plus sign ( +) for counterclockwise moments and a 
minus sign (-) for clockwise moments, or vice versa. Sign consistency 
within a given problem is essential. For the sign convention of Fig. 2/Bd, 
the moment of F about point A (or about the z-axis passing through 
point A) is positive. The curved arrow of the figure is a convenient way 
to represent moments in two-dimensional analysis.

The Cross Product 
In some two-dimensional and many of the three-dimensional prob­
lems to follow, it is convenient to use a vector approach for moment 
calculations. The moment of F about point A of Fig. 2/Bb may be 
represented by the cross-product expression 
(216) 
where r is a position vector which runs from the moment reference 
point A to any point on the line of action of F. The magnitude of this ex­
pression is given by* 
M = Fr sin a = Fd 
(217) 
which agrees with the moment magnitude as given by Eq. 2/5. Note that 
the moment arm d = r sin a does not depend on the particular point on 
the line of action ofF to which the vector r is directed. We establish the 
direction and sense of M by applying the right-hand rule to the se­
quencer x F. If the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction 
of rotation from the positive sense of r to the positive sense ofF, then 
the thumb points in the positive sense of M. 
We must maintain the sequence r x F, because the sequence F x r 
would produce a vector with a sense opposite to that of the correct 
moment. As was the case with the scalar approach, the moment M 
may be thought of as the moment about point A or as the moment 
about the line 0-0 which passes through point A and is perpendicular 
to the plane containing the vectors r and F. When we evaluate the 
moment of a force about a given point, the choice between using the 
vector cross product or the scalar expression depends on how the 
geometry of the problem is specified. If we know or can easily deter­
mine the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the 
force and the moment center, then the scalar approach is generally 
simpler. If, however, F and r are not perpendicular and are easily ex­
pressible in vector notation, then the cross-product expression is often 
preferable. 
In Section B of this chapter, we will see how the vector formulation 
of the moment of a force is especially useful for determining the mo­
ment of a force about a point in three-dimensional situations. 
Varignon's Theorem 
One of the most useful principles of mechanics is Varignon's theo­
rem, which states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to 
the sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same 
point. 
*Se item 7 in Art. en of Appendix C for additional information concerning the cross 
product. 

To prove this theorem, consider the force R acting in the plane of 
the body shown in Fig. 2/9a. The forces P and Q represent any two 
nonrectangular components ofR. The moment ofR about point 0 is 
M0 = rxR 
Because R = P + Q, we may write 
r x R = r x (P + Q) 
Using the distributive law for cross products, we have 
M0=rxR=rxP + rxQ 
(218) 
which says that the moment of R about 0 equals the sum of the mo­
ments about 0 of its components P and Q. This proves the theorem. 
Varignon's theorem need not be restricted to the case of two compo­
nents, but it applies equally well to three or more. Thus we could have 
used any number of concurrent components of R in the foregoing 
proof.* 
Figure 219b illustrates the usefulness of Varignon's theorem. The 
moment of R about point 0 is Rd. However, if d is more difficult to de­
termine than p and q, we can resolve R into the components P and Q, 
and compute the moment as 
M0 = Rd = -pP + qQ 
where we take the clockwise moment sense to be positive. 
Sample Problem 2/5 shows how Varignon's theorem can help us to 
calculate moments.

Sample Problem 2/6 
The trap door OA is raised by the cable AB, which pases over the small fric­
tionless guide pulleys at B. The tension everywhere in the cable is T, and this ten­
sion applied at A causes a moment M0 about the hinge at 0. Plot the quantity M0/T 
as a function of the door elevation angle 8 over the range 0 s 0 s 90° and note mini· 
mum and maximum values. What is the physical significance of this ratio? 
Solution. We begin by constructing a figure which shows the tension force T 
acting directly on the door, which is shown in an arbitrary angular position 0. It 
should be clear that the direction of T will vary as 0 varies. In order to deal with 
this variation, we write a unit vector DAB which "aims" T: 
rAB 
ron - roA 
DAa = - =

and 
ron = 0.4j m and roA = 0.5(cos 8i + sin 8j) m 
rAB = ron - roA = 0.4j - (0.5)(cos Oi + sin Oj) 
= -0.5 cos 8i + (0.4 - 0.5 sin O)j m 
rAB = J(0.5 cos 0)2 + (0.4 - 0.5 sin 8)2

which is plotted in the accompanying graph. The expression MdT is the moment 
arm d (in meters) which runs from 0 to the line of action ofT. It has a maximum 
value of0.4 m at 8 = 53.r (at which point T is horizontal) and a minimum value of 
0 at 8 = 90° (at which point T is vertical). The expression is valid even ifT varies. 
This sample problem treats moments in two-dimensional force systems, and 
it also points out the advantages of carying out a solution for an arbitrary posi·

COUPLE 
The moment produced by two equal, opposite, and noncollinear 
forces is called a couple. Couples have certain unique properties and 
have important applications in mechanics. 
Consider the action of two equal and opposite forces F and -F a dis­
tance d apart, as shown in Fig. 2/lOa. These two forces cannot be combined 
into a single force because their sum in every direction is zero. Their only 
effect is to produce a tendency of rotation. The combined moment of the 
two forces about an axis normal to their plane and passing through any 
point such as 0 in their plane is the couple M. This couple has a magnitude 
M = F(a + d) - Fa 
or 
M=Fd 
Its direction is counterclockwise when viewed from above for the case il­
lustrated. Note especially that the magnitude of the couple is indepen­
dent of the distance a which locates the forces with respect to the 
moment center 0. It follows that the moment of a couple has the same 
value for all moment centers. 
Vector Algebra Method 
We may also express the moment of a couple by using vector alge­
bra. With the cross-product notation of Eq. 2/6, the combined moment 
about point 0 of the forces forming the couple of Fig. 2/lOb is 
M = rA X F + r8 X (-F) = (rA - r8) X F 
where rA and r8 are position vectors which run from point 0 to arbi­
trary points A and B on the lines of action of F and -F, respectively. 
Because rA - r8 = r, we can express M as 
M
= rxF 
Here again, the moment expression contains no reference to the mo­
ment center 0 and, therefore, is the same for all moment centers. Thus, 
we may represent M by a free vector, as shown in Fig. 2/lOc, where the 
direction ofM is normal to the plane of the couple and the sense of M is 
established by the right-hand rule. 
Because the couple vector M is always perpendicular to the plane of 
the forces which constitute the couple, in two-dimensional analysis we 
can represent the sense of a couple vector as clockwise or counterclockwise 
by one of the conventions shown in Fig. 2/lOd. Later, when we deal with 
couple vectors in three-dimensional problems, we wil make ful use of 
vector notation to represent them, and the mathematics will automati­
cally account for their sense. 
Equivalent Couples 
Changing the values of F and d does not change a given couple as 
long as the product Fd remains the same. Likewise, a couple is not af­
fected if the forces act in a different but parallel plane. Figure 2/11 

(P =F) 
Figure 2/11 
shows four different configurations of the same couple M. In each of 
the four cases, the couples are equivalent and are described by the 
same free vector which represents the identical tendencies to rotate the 
bodies. 
Force-Couple Systems 
The effect of a force acting on a body is the tendency to push or pull 
the body in the direction of the force and to rotate the body about any 
fixed axis which does not intersect the line of the force. We can repre­
sent this dual effect more easily by replacing the given force by an equal 
parallel force and a couple to compensate for the change in the moment 
of the force. 
The replacement of a force by a force and a couple is illustrated in 
Fig. 2112, where the given force F acting at point A is replaced by an 
equal force F at some point B and the counterclockwise couple M = Fd. 
The transfer is seen in the middle figure, where the equal and opposite 
forces F and -F are added at point B without introducing any net exter­
nal effects on the body. We now see that the original force at A and the 
equal and opposite one at B constitute the couple M = Fd, which is 
counterclockwise for the sample chosen, as shown in the right-hand part 
of the figure. Thus, we have replaced the original force at A by the same 
force acting at a different point B and a couple, without altering the ex­
ternal effects of the original force on the body. The combination of the 
force and couple in the right-hand part of Fig. 2112 is referred to as a 
force-couple system. 
By reversing this process, we can combine a given couple and a force 
which lies in the plane of the couple (normal to the couple vector) to 
produce a single, equivalent force. Replacement of a force by an equiva­
lent force-couple system, and the reverse procedure, have many applica­
tions in mechanics and should be mastered.

Sample Problem 2/7 
The rigid structural member is subjected to a couple consisting of the two 
100-N forces. Replace this couple by an equivalent couple consisting of the two 
forces P and -P, each of which ha.s a magnitude of 400 N. Determine the proper 
angle 0. 
Solution. The original couple is counterclockwise when the plane of the forces 
is viewed from above, and its magnitude is 
[M = Fd] 
M = 100(0.1 )  = 10 N·m 
The forces P and -P produce a counterclockwise couple 
M = 400(0.040) cos 0 
CD Equating the two expressions gives 
Helpful Hint 
10 = (400)(0.040) cos 0

Ans. 
CD Since the two equal couples are parallel fre vectors, the only dimensions 
which are relevant are those which give the perpendicular distances between 
the forces of the couples. 
Sample Problem 2/8 
Replace the horizontal 400-N force acting on the lever by an equivalent sys­
tem consisting of a force at 0 and a couple. 
Solution. We apply two equal and opposite 400-N forces at 0 and identify the 
counterclockwise couple 
[M = Fd] 
M = 400(0.200 sin 60°) = 69.3 N •m 
Ans. 
CD Thus, the origin.al force is equivalent to the 400-N force at 0 and the 69.3-N · m 
couple as shown in the third of the three equivalent figures. 
Helpful Hint 
CD The reverse of this problem is often encountered, namely, the replacement 
of a force and a couple by a single force. Proceding in reverse is the same as 
replacing the couple by two forces, one of which is equal and opposite to the 
400-N force at 0. The moment arm to the second force would be MIF = 
69.3/400 - 0.1732 m, which is 0.2 sin 600, thus determining the line of action of 
the single resultant force of 400 N.

2/6 R ESULTANTS 
The properties of force, moment, and couple were developed in the 
previous four articles. Now we are ready to describe the resultant action of 
a group or system offorces. Most problems in mechanics deal with a system 
of forces, and it is usually necesary to reduce the system to its simplest 
form to describe its action. The resultant of a system of forces is the sim­
plest force combination which can replace the original forces without alter­
ing the external effect on the rigid body to which the forces are applied. 
Equilibrium of a body is the condition in which the resultant of al 
forces acting on the body is zero. This condition is studied in statics. When 
the resultant of all forces on a body is not zero, the acceleration of the body 
is obtained by equating the force resultant to the product of the mass and 
acceleration of the body. This condition is studied in dynamics. Thus, the 
determination of resultants is basic to both statics and dynamics. 
The most common type of force system occurs when the forces all 
act in a single plane, say, the x-y plane, as illustrated by the system of 
thre forces Fh F2, and F3 in Fig. 2fl3a. We obtain the magnitude and 
direction of the resultant force R by forming the force polygon shown 
in part b of the figure, where the forces are added head-to-tail in any 
sequence. Thus, for any system of coplanar forces we may write 
R = F1 + F2 + Fa +  ·

R = j(Ï.F,f' + (ÏFy)2

(219) 
Graphically, the correct line of action of R may be obtained by pre­
serving the correct lines of action of the forces and adding them by the 
parallelogram law. We see this in part a of the figure for the case of 
three forces where the sum R1 of F 2 and F 3 is added to F 1 to obtain R. 
The principle of transmissibility has been used in this process. 
Algebraic Method 
We can use algebra to obtain the resultant force and its line of ac­
tion as follows: 
1. Choose a convenient reference point and move al forces to that 
point. This process is depicted for a three-force system in Figs. 
2/14a and b, where M11 M2, and M3 are the couples resulting from 
the transfer of forces FI> F2, and F3 from their respective original 
lines of action to lines of action through point 0. 
2. Add all forces at 0 to form the resultant force R, and add al couples 
to form the resultant couple M0. We now have the single force­
couple system, as shown in Fig. 2114c. 
3. In Fig. 2/14d, find the line of action of R by requiring R to have a 
moment of M0 about point 0. Note that the force systems of Figs. 
2114a and 2114d are equivalent, and that l:.(Fd) in Fig. 2114a is equal 
to Rd in Fig. 2/14d.

Principle of Moments 
This process is summarized in equation form by 
R = ®F 
M0 = ®M = ®(Fd) 
Rd = M0 
d = Mo 
R 
(2110) 
The first two ofEqs. 2110 reduce a given system of forces to a force-couple 
system at an arbitrarily chosen but convenient point 0. The last equation 
specifies the distance d from point 0 to the line of action ofR, and states 
that the moment of the resultant force about any point 0 equals the sum 
of the moments of the original forces of the system about the same point. 
This extends Varignon's theorem to the case of nonconcurrent force sys­
tems; we call this extension the principle of moments. 
For a concurrent system of forces where the lines of action of all 
forces pass through a common point 0, the moment sum ¯Mo about 
that point is zero. Thus, the line of action of the resultant R = ®F, de­
termined by the first of Eqs. 2110, passes through point 0. For a paral­
lel force system, select a coordinate axis in the direction of the forces. 
If the resultant force R for a given force system is zero, the resultant 
of the system need not be zero because the resultant may be a couple. 
The three forces in Fig. 2/15, for instance, have a zero resultant force 
but have a resultant clockwise couple M = Fs(l.

Ans. 
Hence, the resultant R may be applied at any point on the line which makes a 
63.2° angle with the x-axis and is tangent at point A to a circle of 1.60-m radius 
with center 0, as shown in part b of the figure. We apply the equation Rd = M0 in 
an absolute-value sense (ignoring any sign of M 0) and let the physics of the situa­
tion, as depicted in Fig. a, dictate the final placement ofR. Had M0 been counter­
clockwise, the correct line of action ofR would have been the tangent at point B. 
The resultant R may also be located by determining its intercept distance b 
to point C on the x-axis, Fig. c. With R% and Ry acting through point C, only Ry 
exerts a moment about 0 so that

b = 132_4

Alternatively, the y-intereept could have been obtained by noting that the mo­
ment about 0 would be due to R" only. 
A more formal approach in determining the final line of action of R is to use 
the vector expression 
r x R = M0 
where r = xi + yj is a position vector running from point 0 to any point on the 
line of action of R. Substituting the vector expressions for r, R, and M0 and car­
rying out the cross product result in 
(xi + yj) x (66.9i + 132.-ij) = -237k 
( 132.4x - 66.9y)k = -237k 
Thus, the desired line of action, Fig. c, is given by 
132.4x - 66.9y = -237 
® By setting y = 0, we obtain x = - 1.792 m, which agrees with our earlier calcula­
tion of the distance b.

R ECTANGULAR COMPONENTS 
Many problems in mechanics require analysis in three dimensions, 
and for such problems it is often necessary to resolve a force into its 
three mutually perpendicular components. The force F acting at point 0 
in Fig. 2/16 has the rectangular components Fx, Fy, Fz, where 
Fy = F cos By 
Fz = F cos O:e 
F = JF 2 + F 2 + F 2 
r 
y 
z 
F = F) + F J + Fzk 
F = F(i cos Ox + j cos Oy + k cos Oz) 
(211 1) 
The unit vectors i, j, and k are in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respec­
tively. Usin.g the direction cosines of F, which are l = cos Ox, m = cos Oy, 
and n "" cos O:e, where l2 + m2 + n2 "" 1, we may write the force as 
( F = F(li + mj + nk) ) 
(2/12) 
We may regard the right-side expression of Eq. 2/12 as the force 
magnitude F times a unit vector nF which characterizes the direction of 
F, or 
F = Fnp 
(2112a) 
Thus the x, y, and z scalar components of F are the scalar coefficients of 
the unit vectors i, j, and k, respectively. 

Article 2/7 Recta n g u l a r  C o m ponents 67 
(b) Specification by two angles which orient the fine of action 
of the force. Consider the geometry of Fig. 2/18. We assume that the 
angles (J and <P are known. First resolve F into horizontal and vertical 
components. 
Fry = F cos cp 
Fz = F sin cp 
Then resolve the horizontal component Fry into x- and y-components. 
Fx = Fry cos 9 = F cos cp cos 8 
Fy = Fry sin (J = F cos cp sin 0 
The quantities F:x, Fy, and Fz are the desired scalar components ofF. 
The choice of orientation of the coordinate system is arbitrary, with 
convenience being the primary consideration. However, we must use a 
right-handed set of axes in our three-dimensional work to be consistent 
with the right-hand-rule definition of the cross product. When we rotate 
from the x- to the y-axis through the 90° angle, the positive direction for 
the z-axis in a right-handed system is that of the advancement of a 
right-banded screw rotated in the same sense. This is equivalent to the 
right-hand rule. 
Dot Product 
We can express the rectangular components of a force F (or any 
other vector) with the aid of the vector operation known as the dot or 
scalar product (see item 6 in Art. C/7 of Appendix C). The dot product of 
two vectors P and Q, Fig. 2/19a, is defined as the product of their mag­
nitudes times the cosine of the angle a between them. It is written as 
P·Q = PQ cos a 
We can view this product either as the orthogonal projection P cos a of 
P in the direction of Q multiplied by Q, or as the orthogonal projection 
Q cos a of Q in the direction of P multiplied by P. In either case the dot 
product of the two vectors is a scalar quantity. Thus, for instance, we can 
express the scalar component Fx = F cos O:x of the force F in Fig. 2/16 
as F, = F · i, where i is the unit vector in the x-direction.

Figure 2/20 
In more general terms, if n is a unit vector in a specified direction, 
the projection of F in the n-direction, Fig. 2/19b, has the magnitude 
F11 = F·n. If we want to express the projection in the n-direction as a 
vector quantity, then we multiply its scalar component, expressed by 
F · n, by the unit vector n to give Fn = (F· n)n. We may write this as 
F,. = F · nn without ambiguity because the term nn is not defined, and 
so the complete expression cannot be misinterpreted as F ·  (nn). 
If the direction cosines of n are a, {3, and y, then we may write n in 
vector component form like any other vector as 
n = ai + ,8j + yk 
where in this case its magnitude is unity. If the direction cosines of F 
with respect to reference axes x-y-z are l, m, and n, then the projection 
ofF in the n-direction becomes 
because 
and 
Fn = F·n = F(li + mj + nkHai + pj + yk) 
= F(la + mp + ny) 
i·i = j ·j = k ·k = 1 
i·j = j ·i = i·k = k· i  = j ·k = k·j = 0 
The latter two sets of equations are true because i, j, and k have unit 
length and are mutually perpendicular. 
Angle between Two Vectors 
If the angle between the force F and the direction specified by the 
unit vector n is 8, then from the dot-product definition we have F · n  = 
Fn cos 0 = F cos 0, where lnl = n = 1. Thus, the angle between F and n is 
given by 
F·n 
£J = cos-1
--
F 
In general, the angle between any two vectors P and Q is 
P · Q  
8 = cos- 1 --
PQ 
(2/13) 
(2/13a) 
If a force F is perpendicular to a line whose direction is specified by the 
unit vector n, then cos 0 = 0, and F · n  = 0. Note that this relationship 
does not mean that either F or n is zero, as would be the case with 
scalar multiplication where (A)(B) = 0 requires that either A or B (or 
both) be zero. 
The dot-product relationship applies to nonintersecting vectors as 
well as to intersecting vectors. Thus, the dot product of the noninter­
secting vectors P and Q in Fig. 2120 is Q times the projection of P' on Q, 
or P' Q cos a = PQ cos a because P' and P are the same when treated as 
free vectors.

MOMENT AND COUPLE 
In two-dimensional analyses it is often convenient to determine a 
moment magnitude by scalar multiplication using the moment-arm 
rule. In three dimensions, however, the determination of the perpendic­
ular distance between a point or line and the line of action of the force 
can be a tedious computation. A vector approach with cross-product 
multiplication then becomes advantageous. 
Moments in Three Dimensions 
Consider a force F with a given line of action acting on a body, 
Fig. 212la, and any point 0 not on this line. Point 0 and the line ofF estab­
lish a plane A. The moment Mo of F about an axis through 0 normal to 
the plane has the magnitude M0 = Fd, where d is the perpendicular dis­
tance from 0 to the line of F. This moment is also referred to as the mo­
ment ofF about the point 0. 
The vector Mo is normal to the plane and is directed along the axis 
through 0. We can describe both the magnitude and the direction ofMo 
by the vector cross-product relation introduced in Art. 2/4. (Refer to 
item 7 in Art. en of Appendix C.) The vector r runs from 0 to any point 
on the line of action of F. As described in Art. 2/4, the cross product of r 
and F is written r x F and has the magnitude (r sin a)F, which is the 
same as Fd, the magnitude of Mo. 
The correct direction and sense of the moment are established by 
the right-hand rule, described previously in Arts. 2/4 and 2/5. Thus, 
with r and F treated as free vectors emanating from 0, Fig. 2/21b, the 
thumb points in the direction ofMo if the fingers of the right hand curl 
in the direction of rotation from r to F through the angle a. Therefore, 
we may write the moment of F about the axis through 0 as

The order r x F of the vectors must be maintained because F x r 
would produce a vector with a sense opposite to that of M0; that is, 
F X r = -Mo.

To gain more confidence in the cross-product relationship, exam­
ine the three components of the moment of a force about a point as 
obtained from Fig. 2122. This figure shows the three components of a 
force F acting at a point A located relative to 0 by the vector r. The 
scalar magnitudes of the moments of these forces about the positive 
x-, y-, and z-axes through 0 can be obtained from the moment-arm 
rule, and are 
which agree with the respective terms in the determinant expansion for 
the cross product r x F. 
Moment about an Arbitrary Axis 
We can now obtain an expression for the moment M, ofF about any 
axis A through 0, as shown in Fig. 2123. If n is a unit vector in the 
A-direction, then we can use the dot-product expression for the compo­
nent of a vector as described in Art. 217 to obtain Mo · n, the component 
of M0 in the direction of,\. This scalar is the magnitude of the moment 
MA of F about ,\. 
To obtain the vector expression for the moment M, of F about A, 
multiply the magnitude by the directional unit vector n to obtain 
( MA. = (r X F · n)n ) 
(2/16) 
where r x F replaces Mo. The expression r x F · n  is known as a triple 
scalar product (see item 8 in Art. C/7, Appendix C). It need not be writ­
ten (r x F)·n because a cross product cannot be formed by a vector and 
a scalar. Thus, the association r x (F·n) would have no meaning. 
The triple scalar product may be represented by the determinant

where a, {3, 'Y are  the direction cosines ofthe unit vector n. 
Varignon's Theorem in Three Dimensions 
(217) 
In Art. 214 we introduced Varignon's theorem in two dimensions. 
The theorem is easily extended to three dimensions. Figure 2/24 shows 
a system of concurrent forces F 1, F 2, F 3, . . . .  The sum of the moments 
about 0 of these forces is 
r x F1 + r x F2 + r x F3 + · · · = r x (F1 + F2 + F3 + · · · )  
= r  x LF 

where we have used the distributive law for cross products. Using the 
symbol Mo to represent the sum of the moments on the left side of the 
above equation, we have 
( Mo = µ(r X F) = r X R) 
(2118) 
This equation states that the sum of the moments of a system of concur­
rent forces about a given point equals the moment of their sum about 
the same point. As mentioned in Art. 214, this principle has many appli­
cations in mechanics. 
Couples in Three Dimensions 
The concept of the couple was introduced in Art. 2/5 and is easily 
extended to three dimensions. Figure 2/25 shows two equal and opposite 
forces F and -F acting on a body. The vector r runs from any point B 
on the line of action of -F to any point A on the line of action of F. 
Points A and B are located by position vectors rA and r8 from any point 
0. The combined moment of the two forces about 0 is 
However, rA - rB = r, so that all reference to the moment center 0 dis­
appears, and the moment of the couple becomes 
(2119) 
Thus, tbe moment of a couple is the same about all points. The magni­
tude ofM is M '"' Fd, where d is  the perpendicular distance between the 
lines of action of the two forces, as described in Art. 2/5. 
The moment of a couple is a free vector, whereas the moment of a 
force about a point (which is also the moment about a defined axis 
through the point) is a sliding vector whose direction is along the axis 
through the point. As in the case of two dimensions, a couple tends to 
produce a pure rotation of tbe body about an axis normal to tbe plane of 
the forces which constitute the couple. 
Couple vectors obey all of the rules which govern vector quantities. 
Thus, in Fig. 2/26 the couple vector M1 due to F1 and -F1 may be added

as shown to the couple vector M2 due to F 2 and -F 2 to produce the cou­
ple M, which, in turn, can be produced by F and -F. 
In Art. 215 we learned how to replace a force by its equivalent 
force-couple system. You should also be able to carry out this replace­
ment in three dimensions. The procedure is represented in Fig. 2/27, 
where the force F acting on a rigid body at point A is replaced by an 
equal force at point B and the couple M = r x F. By adding the equal 
and opposite forces F and -F at B, we obtain the couple composed of 
-F and the original F. Thus, we see that the couple vector is simply the 
moment of the original force about the point to which the force is being 
moved. We emphasize that r is a vector which runs from B to any point 
on the line of action of the original force passing through A. 
M = r x F

Sample Problem 2/1 1 
Determine the moment of force F about point 0 (a) by inspec:tion and (b) by 
the formal cross-product definition M0 = r x F. 
Solution. (a) Because F is parallel to the y-axis, F has no moment about that 
axis. It should be clear that the moment arm from the x-axis to the line of action 
of F is c and that the moment of F about the x-axis is negative. Similarly, the 
moment arm from the z-axis to the line of action ofF is a, and the moment of F 
about the z-axis is positive. So we have

Sample Problem 2/1 3 
A tension T ofmagnitude 10 kN is applied to the cable attached to the top A 
of the rigid mast and secured to the ground at B. Determine the moment M. ofT 
about the z-axis passing through the base 0. 
Solution (a}. The required moment may be obtained by finding the compo· 
nent along the z-axis of the moment Mo of T about point 0. The vector Mo is 
normal to the plane defined by T and point 0, as shown in the accompanying fig­
ure. In the use of Eq. 2/14 to find Mo. the vector r is any vector from point 0 to 
CD the line of action of T. The simplest choice is the vector from 0 to A, which is 
written as r = 15j m. The vector expression for T is 
From Eq. 2/14, 
fMo = r X F) 
T = TnAB = 10 [ 
12i - 15j + 9k ] 
J(12)2 + ( - 15)2 + (9)2 
= 10(0.5661 - 0.707j + 0.424k) kN 
Mo = 15j X 10(0.566i - 0.707j + 0.424k) 
= 150( -0.566k + 0.424i) kN ·m 
The value M, of the desired moment is the scalar component of Mo in the 
z-direction or M, "" Mo · k. Therefore, 
M, = 150( -0.566k + 0.424i) · k = -84.9 kN · m 
Ans. 
® The minus sign indicates that the vector M. is in the negative z-direction. Ex· 
pressed as a vector, the moment is M, = -84.9k kN · m. 
Solution (b). The force of magnitude T is resolved into components T,. and T ¨ 
in the X·Y plane. Since T, is parallel to the z-axis, it can exert no moment about 
® this axis. The moment M. is, then, due only to T ;cy and is M, = T ,.yd, where d is 
the perpendicular distance from T¨ to 0. The cosine of the angle between T and 
T ¨ is J152 + 122 I J152 + 122 + 92 = 0.906, and therefore, 
T ¨ = 10(0.906) = 9.06 kN 
The moment arm d equals OA multiplied by the sine of the angle between T :ry 
and OA, or 
12 
d = 15 
= 9.37 m 
J122 + 152 
Hence, the moment ofT about the z·axis has the magnitude 
M, = 9.06(9.37) = 84.9 kN · m  
and is clockwise when viewed in the x-y plane. 
Ans. 
Solution (c). The component T ;cy is further resolved into its components T,. and 
T'Y. It is clear that T'Y exerts no moment about the z·axis since it passes through it, so 
that the required moment is due to T"' alone. The direction cosine of T with respect 
to the x·axis is 12/ 92 + 122 + 152 = 0.566 so that T,. = 10(0.56) = 5.66 kN. Thus, 
M. = 5.66( 15) = 84.9 kN · m

Sample Problem 2/1 4 
Determine the magnitude and direc:tion of the couple M which will replace 
the two given couples and still produce the same external effect on the block. 
Specify the two forces F and -F, applied in the two faces of the block parallel to 
they·z plane., which may replace the four given forces. The 30-
forces act paral­
lel to the y-z plane. 
Solution. The couple due to the 30-N forces has the magnitude M1 = 30(0.06) 
= 1.80 N ·m. The direction ofM1 is normal to the plane defined by the two forces, 
and the sense, shown in the figure, is established by the right-hand convention. 
The couple due to the 25-N forces has the magnitude M2 = 25(0.10) = 2.50 N ·m 
with the direction and sense shown in the same figure. The two couple vectors 
combine to give the components 
CD Thus, 
with 
M, = 1.80 sin 60° = 1.559 N • m 
M. = -2.50 + 1.80 cos 60° = - 1.600 N ·m

Ans.

The forces F and -F lie in a plane normal to the couple M, and their mo­
ment arm as seen from the right-hand figure is 100 mm. Thus, each force has the

F = 2·23 = 2 3 N

and the direction 0 = 44.3°. 
Sample Problem 2/1 5 
A force of 400 N is applied at A to the handle of the control lever which is at­
tached to the fixed shaft OB. In determining the effect of the force on the shaft 
at a cross section such as that at 0, we may replace the force by an equivalent 
force at 0 and a couple. Describe this couple as a vector M. 
Solution. The couple may be expressed in vector notation as M = r X F, 
where r = OA = 0.2j + 0.125k m and F = -400i N. Thus, 
M = (0.2j + 0.125k) X ( -400i) = -50j + 80k N ·m 
Alternatively we see that moving the 400-N force through a distance d = 
J0.1252 + 0.22 = 0.236 m to a parallel position through 0 requires the addition of a 
couple M whose magnitude is 
M = Fd = 400(0.236) = 94.3 N·m 
Ans. 
The couple vector is perpendicular to the plane in which the force is shifted, and 
its sense is that of the moment of the given force about 0. The direction of M in 
the y-z plane is given by 
(J = tan-l  = 32.0°

R ESULTANTS 
In Art. 2/6 we defined the resultant as the simplest force combina­
tion which can replace a given system of forces without altering the ex­
ternal effect on the rigid body on which the forces act. We found the 
magnitude and direction of the resultant force for the two-dimensional 
force system by a vector sumation offorces, Eq. 219, and we located the 
line of action of the resultant force by applying the principle of moments, 
Eq. 2/10. These same principles can be extended to three dimensions. 
In the previous article we showed that a force could be moved to a 
parallel position by adding a corresponding couple. Thus, for the system 
of forces F 1, F 2, F 3 •

•
 acting on a rigid body in Fig. 2128a, we may move 
each of them in turn to the arbitrary point 0, provided we also intro­
duce a couple for each force transferred. Thus, for example, we may 
move force F1 to 0, provided we introduce the couple M1 = r1 x Fl> 
where r1 is a vector from 0 to any point on the line of action of F 1. 
When all forces are shifted to 0 in this manner, we have a system of 
concurrent forces at 0 and a system of couple vectors, as represented in 
part b of the figure. The concurrent forces may then be added vectorially 
to produce a resultant force R, and the couples may also be added to 
produce a resultant couple M, Fig. 212&. The general force system, then, 
is reduced to

The point 0 selected as the point of concurrency for the forces i s  ar­
bitrary, and the magnitude and direction of M depend on the particular 
point 0 selected. The magnitude and direction of R, however, are the 
same no matter which point is selected. 
In general, any system of forces may be replaced by its resultant 
force R and the resultant couple M. In dynamics we usually select the 
mass center as the reference point. The change in the linear motion of 
the body is determined by the resultant force, and the change in the an­
gular motion of the body is determined by the resultant couple. In stat­
ics, the body is in complete equilibrium when the resultant force R is 
zero and the resultant couple M is also zero. Thus, the determination of 
resultants is essential in both statics and dynamics. 
We now examine the resultants for several special force systems. 
Concurrent Forces. When forces are concurrent at a point, only the 
first of Eqs. 2/20 needs to be used because there are no moments about 
the point of concurency. 
Parallel Forces. For a system of parallel forces not all in the same 
plane, the magnitude of the parallel resultant force R is simply the mag­
nitude of the algebraic sum of the given forces. The position of its line of 
action is obtained from the principle of moments by requiring that 
r x R : M0. Here r is a position vector extending from the force-couple 
reference point 0 to the final line of action of R, and Mo is the sum of 
the moments of the individual forces about 0. See Sample Problem 2/17 
for an example of parallel-force systems. 
Coplanar Forces. Article 2/6 was devoted to this force system. 
Wrench Resultant. When the resultant couple vector M is parallel 
to the resultant force R, as shown in Fig. 2129, the resultant is called a 
wrench. By definition a wrench is positive if the couple and force vectors 
point in the same direction and negative if they point in opposite direc­
tions. A common example of a positive wrench is found with the applica­
tion of a screwdriver, to drive a right-handed screw. Any general force 
system may be represented by a wrench applied along a unique line of 
action. This reduction is illustrated in Fig. 2/30, where part a of the fig­
ure represents, for the general force system, the resultant force R acting 
at some point 0 and the corresponding resultant couple M. Although M 
is a free vector, for convenience we represent it as acting through 0. 
In part b of the figure, M is resolved into components M1 along the di­
rection of R and   normal to R In part c of the figure, the couple   is 
replaced by its equivalent of two forces R and -R separated by a distance

d = M.jR with -R applied at 0 to cancel the original R. This step leaves 
the resultant R, which acts along a new and unique line of action, and the 
parallel couple Ml> which is a fre vector, as shown in part d of the figure. 
Thus, the resultants of the original general force system have been trans­
formed into a wrench (positive in this illustration) with its unique axis de­
fined by the new position ofR. 
We see from Fig. 2/30 that the axis of the wrench resultant lies in a 
plane through 0 normal to the plane defined by R and M. The wrench is 
the simplest form in which the resultant of a general force system may 
be expressed. This form of the resultant, however, has limited applica­
tion, because it is usually more convenient to use as the reference point 
some point 0 such as the mass center of the body or another convenient 
origin of coordinates not on the wrench axis.

Sample Problem 2/1 6 
Determine the resultant of the force and couple system which acts on the 
rectangular solid. 
Solution. We choose point 
0 
as a convenient reference point for the initial 
step of reducing the given forces to a force-couple system. The resultant force is 
R = 'LF = (80 - 80)i + ( 100 - 100)j + (50 - 50)k = O N  
The sum of the moments about 
0 
is 
Mo = [50( 1.6) - 70)i + [80(1.2) - 96)j + [100(1) - lOO)k 
= lOi N · m  
Hence, the resultant consists of a couple, which of course may be applied at any 
point on the body or the body extended. 
Helpful Hints 
CD Since the force summation is zero, we conclude that the resultant, if it exists, 
must be a couple. 
® The moments associated with the force pairs are easily obtained by using the 
M = Fd rule and assigning the unit-vector direction by inspection. In many 
thretHlimensional problems, this may be simpler than the M = r x F approach. 
Sample Problem 2/1 7 
Determine the resultant of the system of parallel forces which act on the 
plate. Solve with a vector approach. 
Solution. Transfer of all forces to point 
0 
results in the forc¥ouple system 
R = 'LF = (200 + 500 - 300 - 50)j = 350j N 
Mo = (50(0.35) - 300(0.35))i + [-50(0.50) - 200(0.50))k 
= -87.5i - 125k N ·m 
The placement of R so that it alone represents the above forc¥ouple system is 
determined by the principle of moments in vector form 
r x R = Mo  
(xi + yj + zk) x 350j = -87.5i - 125k 
350xk - 350zi = -87.5i - 125k 
From the one vector equation we may obtain the two scalar equations 
350x = -125 
and 
-350z = -87.5 
Hence, x = -0.357 m and z = 0.250 m are the coordinates through which the 
line of action of R must pass. The value of y may, of course, be any value, as 
CD permitted by the principle of transmissibility. Thus, as expected, the variable y 
drops out of the above vector analysis.

Sample Problem 2/1 8 
Replace the two forces and the negative wrench by a single force R applied 
at A and the corresponding couple M. 
Solution. The resultant force has the components 
[R" = IF.J 
[R1 = IF1] 
[R, = IFJ 
Thus, 
and 
R" = 500 sin 40" + 700 sin so· = 928 N 
R1 = 600 + 500 cos 40° cos 45° = 871 N 
R, = 700 cos so• + 500 cos 40° sin 45° = 621 N 
R = 928i + 87lj + S21k N 
R = J(928)2 + (871)2 + (621)2 = 1416 N 
The couple to be added as a result of moving the 500-N force is 
Ans. 
CD [M = r x Fl 
M500 = (0.08i + 0.12j + 0.05k) x 500(i sin 40° 
+ j cos 40• cos 45• + k cos 40° sin 45•) 
where r is the vector from A to B. 
The term-by-term, or determinant, expansion gives 
Msoo = 18.95i - 5.59j - 1S.90k N · m 
® The moment of the SOO-N force about A is written by inspection of its x- and 
z-.components, which gives 
ƪ0 = (600)(0.060)i + (600)(0.040)k 
= 36.0i + 24.0k N ·m 
The moment of the 700-N force about A i s  easily obtained from the moments of 
the x- and z-.components of the force. The result becomes 
M700 = (700 cos 60°)(0.030)i - [(700 sin 60°)(0.060) 
+ (700 cos so•)(O.lOO)JJ - (700 sin S0°)(0.030)k 
= 10.5i - 71.4j - 18.19k N · m 
@ Also, the couple of the given wrench may be written 
@ 
M '  = 25.0( -i sin 40° - j cos 40° cos 45° - k cos 40° sin 45°) 
= - 1S.07i - 13.54j - 13.54k N · m  
Therefore, the resultant couple on adding together the i-, j-, and k-terms of the 
four M's is 
M = 49.4i - 90.5j - 24.Sk N · m 
and 
M = j(49.4)2 + (90.5)2 + (24.6)2 = 106.0 N ·m 
Ans.

Helpful Hints 
G) Sugestion: Check the cross-product 
results by evaluating the moments 
about A of the components of the 
500-N force directly from the sketch. 
® For the 600-N and 700-N forces it is 
easier to obtain the components of 
their moments about the coordinate 
directions through A by inspection 
of the figure than it is to set up the 
cross-product relations. 
@ The 25-N·m couple vector of the 
wrench points in the direction oppo­
site to that of the 500-N force, and 
we must resolve it into its x·, y-, and 
z-components to be added to the 
other couple-vector components. 
@ Although the resultant couple vec­
tor M in the sketch of the resultants 
is shown through A, we recognize 
that a couple vector is a free vector 
and therefore has no specified line 
of action.

Sample Problem 2/1 9 
Determine the wrench resultant of the three forces acting on the bracket. 
Calculate the cordinates of the point P in the x-y plane through which the resul­
tant force of the wrench acts. Also find the magnitude of the couple M of the 
wrench. 
Solution. The direction cosines of the couple M of the wrench must be the 
CD same as those of the resultant force R, assuming that the wrench is positive. 
The resultant force is 
R = 20i + 40j + 40k N 
R = J(20)2 + (40)2 + (40)2 = 60 N 
and its direction cosines are 
cos e., = 20/60 = 113 
cos By = 40/60 = 2/3 
cos o. = 40/60 = 2/3 
The moment of the wrench couple must equal the sum of the moments of 
the given forces about point P through which R passes. The moments about P of 
the three forces are 
(M)R.. = 20yk N·mm 
(M)R, = -40(60)i - 40xk N · mm  
(M)n, = 40(80 - y)i - 40(100 - x)j N · mm  
and the total moment is

cos 8,. "' (800 - 40y)IM 
cos 81 "' ( -4000 + 40x)/M

Solution of the three equations gives

y = 40 mm 
Ans. 
We see that M turned out to be negative, which means that the couple vector is 
pointing in the direction opposite to R, which makes the wrench negative. 
Helpful Hint 
CD We assume initially that the wrench 
is positive. If M turns out to be neg­
ative, then the direction of the cou­
ple vector is opposite to that of the 
resultant force.

2/1 0  CHAPTER R EVI EW 
In Chapter 2 we have established the properties of forces, moments, and 
couples, and the correct procedures for representing their effects. Mastery of 
this material is essential for our study of equilibrium in the chapters which 
follow. Failure to correctly use the procedures of Chapter 2 is a common cause 
of errors in applying the principles of equilibrium. When difficulties arise, you 
should refer to this chapter to be sure that the forces, moments, and couples 
are correctly represented. 
Forces 
There is frequent need to represent forces as vectors, to resolve a single 
force into components along desired directions, and to combine two or more 
concurrent forces into an equivalent resultant force . Specifically, you should 
be able to: 
1. Resolve a given force vector into its components along given directions, 
and express the vector in terms of the unit vectors along a given set of 
axes. 
2. Express a force as a vector when given its magnitude and information 
about its line of action. This information may be in the form of two points 
along the line of action or angles which orient the line of action . 
3. Use the dot product to compute the projection of a vector onto a specified 
line and the angle between two vectors. 
4. Compute the resultant of two or more forces concurrent at a point . 
Moments 
The tendency of a force to rotate a body about an axis is described by a 
moment (or torque), which is a vector quantity. We have seen that finding 
the moment of a force is often facilitated by combining the moments of the 
components of the force. When working with moment vectors you should be 
able to: 
1. Determine a moment by using the moment-arm rule. 
2. Use the vector cross product to compute a moment vector in terms of a 
force vector and a position vector locating the line of action of the force. 
3. Utilize Varignon's theorem to simplify the calculation of moments, in both 
scalar and vector forms. 
4. Use the triple scalar product to compute the moment of a force vector 
about a given axis through a given point . 
Couples 
A couple is the combined moment of two equal, opposite, and noncollinear 
forces. The unique effect of a couple is to produce a pure twist or rotation 
regardless of where the forces are located. The couple is useful in replacing a 

Article 2/1 0 Ch apter Review 1 01 
force acting at a point by a force-couple system at a different point. To solve 
problems involving couples you should be able to: 
1. Compute the moment of a couple, given the couple forces and either their 
separation distance or any position vectors locating their lines of action. 
2. Replace a given force by an equivalent force-couple system, and vice 
versa. 
Resultants 
We can reduce an arbitrary system of forces and couples to a single 
resultant force applied at an arbitrary point, and a corresponding resultant 
couple. We can further combine this resultant force and couple into a wrench 
to give a single resultant force along a unique line of action, together with a 
parallel couple vector. To solve problems involving resultants you should be 
able to: 
1. Compute the magnitude, direction, and line of action of the resultant of a 
system of coplanar forces if that resultant is a force; otherwise, compute 
the moment of the resultant couple. 
2. Apply the principle of moments to simplify the calculation of the moment 
of a system of coplanar forces about a given point. 
3. Replace a given general force system by a wrench along a specific line of 
action. 
Equilibrium 
You will use the preceding concepts and methods when you study 
equilibrium in the following chapters. Let us sumarize the concept of 
equilibrium: 
1. When the resultant force on a body is zero (yF = 0), the body is in 
translational equilibrium. This means that its center of mass is either at 
rest or moving in a straight line with constant velocity. 
2. In addition, if the resultant couple is zero O:M = 0), the body is in 
rotational equilibrium, either having no rotational motion or rotating 
with a constant angular velocity. 
3. When both resultants are zero, the body is in complete equilibrium.

In many applications of mechanics, the sum of the forces acting on a body is zero or near zero, and a state of equi­
librium is assumed to exist. This apparatus is designed to hold a car body in equil ibrium for a considerable range 
of orientations during vehicle production. Even though there is motion, it is slow and steady with minimal accelera­
tion, so that the assumption of equilibrium is justified during the design of the mechanism.

INTRODUCTION 
Statics deals primarily with the description of the force conditions 
necessary and sufficient to maintain the equilibrium of engineering 
structures. This chapter on equilibrium, therefore, constitutes the 
most important part of statics, and the procedures developed here 
form the basis for solving problems in both statics and dynamics. We wil 
make continual use of the concepts developed in Chapter 2 involving 
forces, moments, couples, and resultants as we apply the principles of 
equilibrium. 
When a body is in equilibrium, the resultant of all forces acting on 
it is zero. Thus, the resultant force R and the resultant couple M are 
both zero, and we have the equilibrium equations 
( 
R = LF = 0 
M = LM = 0 J 
(31) 
These requirements are both necessary and sufficient conditions for 
equilibrium. 
All physical bodies are three-dimensional, but we can treat many of 
them as two-dimensional when the forces to which they are subjected 
act in a single plane or can be projected onto a single plane. When this 
simplification is not possible, the problem must be treated as three­
dimensional. We will follow the arrangement used in Chapter 2 and dis­
cuss in Section A the equilibrium of bodies subjected to two-dimensional

SYSTEM ISOLATION AND THE fREE-BODY DIAGRAM 
Before we apply Eqs. 3/1, we must define unambiguously the partic­
ular body or mechanical system to be analyzed and represent clearly 
and completely all forces acting on the body. Omission of a force which 
acts on the body in question, or inclusion of a force which does not act 
on the body, will give erroneous results. 
A mechanical system is defined as a body or group of bodies which 
can be conceptually isolated from all other bodies. A system may be a 
single body or a combination of connected bodies. The bodies may be 
rigid or nonrigid. The system may also be an identifiable fluid mass, ei­
ther liquid or gas, or a combination of fluids and solids. In statics we 
study primarily forces which act on rigid bodies at rest, although we also 
study forces acting on fluids in equilibrium. 
Once we decide which body or combination of bodies to analyze, we 
then treat this body or combination as a single body isolated from all 
surrounding bodies. This isolation is accomplished by means of the 
free-body diagram, which is a diagrammatic representation of the 
isolated system treated as a single body. The diagram shows all forces 
applied to the system by mechanical contact with other bodies, which 
are imagined to be removed. If appreciable body forces are present, 
such as gravitational or magnetic attraction, then these forces must 
also be shown on the free-body diagram of the isolated system. Only 
after such a diagram has been carefully drawn should the equilibrium 
equations be written. Because of its critical importance, we emphasize 
here that 
the free-body diagram is the most important single 
step in the solution of problems in mechanics. 
Before attempting to draw a free-body diagram, we must recall the 
basic characteristics of force. These characteristics were described in 
Art. 2/2, with primary attention focused on the vector properties of 
force. Forces can be applied either by direct physical contact or by re­
mote action. Forces can be either internal or external to the system 
under consideration. Application of force is accompanied by reactive 
force, and both applied and reactive forces may be either concentrated 
or distributed. The principle of transmissibility permits the treatment 
of force as a sliding vector as far as its external effects on a rigid body 
are concerned. 
We will now use these force characteristics to develop conceptual 
models of isolated mechanical systems. These models enable us to write 
the appropriate equations of equilibrium, which can then be analyzed.

Modeling the Action of Forces 
Figure 3/1 shows the common types of force application on me­
chanical systems for analysis in two dimensions. Each example 
shows the force exerted on the body to be isolated, by the body to be 
removed. Newton's third law, which notes the existence of an equal 
and opposite reaction to every action, must be carefully observed. 
The force exerted on the body in question by a contacting or support­
ing member is always in the sense to oppose the movement of the 
isolated body which would occur if the contacting or supporting body 
were removed. 
In Fig. 3/1, Example 1 depicts the action of a flexible cable, belt, 
rope, or chain on the body to which it is attached. Because of its flexi­
bility, a rope or cable is unable to offer any resistance to bending,

A built-in or fixed

supporting an axial 
force F, a transverse 
force V (shear force), 
and a couple M

prevent rotation. 
The resultant of 
gravitational 
attraction on all 
elements of a body of 
mass m is the weight 
W = mg and acts 
toward the center of 
the earth through the 
center of gravity G. 
Spring force is tensile if 
the spring is stretched 
and compressive if 
compressed. For a 
linearly elastic spring 
the stiffness k is the 
force required to deform 
the spring a unit 
distance. 
For a linear torsional 
spring, the applied 
momentM is 
proportional to the 
angular deflection 9 
from the neutral 
position. The stiffness 
k1• is the moment 
required to deform the 
spring one radian.

shear, or compression and therefore exerts only a tension force in a 
direction tangent to the cable at its point of attachment. The force 
exerted by the cable on the body to which it is attached is always away 
from the body. When the tension Tis large compared with the weight of 
the cable, we may assume that the cable forms a straight line. When 

Arti cle 3/2 System Isolat i o n  and the Free-Body Diagram 113 
the cable weight is not negligible compared with its tension, the sag of 
the cable becomes important, and the tension in the cable changes di­
rection and magnitude along its length. 
When the smooth surfaces of two bodies are in contact, as in Exam­
ple 2, the force exerted by one on the other is normal to the tangent to 
the surfaces and is compressive. Although no actual surfaces are per­
fectly smooth, we can assume this to be so for practical purposes in 
many instances. 
When mating surfaces of contacting bodies are rough, as in Exam­
ple 3, the force of contact is not necessarily normal to the tangent to the 
surfaces, but may be resolved into a tangential or frictional component F 
and a normal component N. 
Example 4 illustrates a number of forms of mechanical support 
which effectively eliminate tangential friction forces. In these cases the 
net reaction is normal to the supporting surface. 
Example 5 shows the action of a smooth guide on the body it sup­
ports. There cannot be any resistance parallel to the guide. 
Example 6 illustrates the action of a pin connection. Such a con­
nection can support force in any direction normal to the axis of the 
pin. We usually represent this action in terms of two rectangular com­
ponents. The correct sense of these components in a specific problem 
depends on how the member is loaded. When not otherwise initially 
known, the sense is arbitrarily assigned and the equilibrium equa­
tions are then written. If the solution of these equations y ields a posi­
tive algebraic sign for the force component, the assigned sense is 
correct. A negative sign indicates the sense is opposite to that initially 
assigned. 
If the joint is free to turn about the pin, the connection can support 
only the force R. If the joint is not free to turn, the connection can also 
support a resisting couple M. The sense of M is arbitrarily shown here, 
but the true sense depends on how the member is loaded. 
Example 7 shows the resultants of the rather complex distribution 
of force over the cross section of a slender bar or beam at a built-in or 
fixed support. The sense of the reactions F and V and the bending cou­
ple M in a given problem depends, of course, on how the member is 
loaded. 
One of the most common forces is that due to gravitational attrac­
tion, Example 8. This force affects all elements of mass in a body and is, 
therefore, distributed throughout it. The resultant of the gravitational 
forces on al elements is the weight W = mg of the body, which passes 
through the center of gravity G and is directed toward the center of the 
earth for earthbound structures. The location of G is frequently obvious 
from the geometry of the body, particularly where there is symmetry. 
When the location is not readily apparent, it must be determined by 
experiment or calculations. 
Similar remarks apply to the remote action of magnetic and electric 
forces. These forces of remote action have the same overall effect on a 
rigid body as forces of equal magnitude and direction applied by direct 
external contact. 
Example 9 illustrates the action of a linear elastic spring and of 
a nonlinear spring with either hardening or softening characteris­
tics. The force exerted by a linear spring, in tension or compression,

i s  given by F = kx, where k i s  the stiffness or modulus of the spring 
and x is its deformation measured from the neutral or undeformed 
position. 
In Example 10 we see the action of a torsional (or clockwork) 
spring. Shown is a linear version; as suggested in Example 9 for exten­
sion springs, nonlinear torsional springs also exist. 
The representations in Fig. 3/1 are not free-body diagrams, but are 
merely elements used to construct free-body diagrams. Study these ten 
conditions and identify them in the problem work so that you can draw 
the correct free-body diagrams. 
CONSTRUCTION OF FREE-BODY DIAGRAMS 
The full procedure for drawing a free-body diagram which isolates a 
body or system consists of the following steps. 
Step 1. Decide which system to isolate. The system chosen should 
usually involve one or more of the desired unknown quantities. 
Step 2. Next isolate the chosen system by drawing a diagram which 
represents its complete external boundary. This boundary defines the 
isolation of the system from all other attracting or contacting bodies, 
which are considered removed. This step is often the most crucial of all. 
Make certain that you have completely isolated the system before pro­
ceeding with the next step. 
Step 3. Identify all forces which act on the isolated system as ap­
plied by the removed contacting and attracting bodies, and represent 
them in their proper positions on the diagram of the isolated system. 
Make a systematic traverse of the entire boundary to identify all con­
tact forces. Include body forces such as weights, where appreciable. 
Represent all known forces by vector arrows, each with its proper mag­
nitude, direction, and sense indicated. Each unknown force should be 
represented by a vector arrow with the unknown magnitude or direc­
tion indicated by symbol. If the sense of the vector is also unknown, 
you must arbitrarily assign a sense. The subsequent calculations with 
the equilibrium equations will yield a positive quantity if the correct 
sense was assumed and a negative quantity if the incorrect sense was 
assumed. It is necessary to be consistent with the assigned characteris­
tics of unknown forces throughout all of the calculations. If you are 
consistent, the solution of the equilibrium equations will reveal the cor­
rect senses. 
Step 4. Show the choice of coordinate axes directly on the diagram. 
Pertinent dimensions may also be represented for convenience. Note, 
however, that the free-body diagram serves the purpose of focusing at­
tention on the action of the external forces, and therefore the diagram 
should not be cluttered with excessive extraneous information. Clearly 
distinguish force arrows from arrows representing quantities other than 
forces. For this purpose a colored pencil may be used. 

Arti cle 3/2 System Isolat i o n  and the Free-Body Diagram 115 
Completion of the foregoing four steps will produce a correct fre-body 
diagram to use in applying the governing equations, both in statics and in 
dynamics. Be careful not to omit from the free-body diagram certain 
forces which may not appear at first glance to be needed in the calcula­
tions. It is only through complete isolation and a systematic representa­
tion of aU external forces that a reliable accounting of the effects of all 
applied and reactive forces can be made. Very often a force which at first 
glance may not appear to influence a desired result does indeed have an 
influence. Thus, the only safe procedure is to include on the free-body dia­
gram al forces whose magnitudes are not obviously negligible.

are omitted for clarity. In each case we treat the entire system as a single 
body, so that the internal forces are not shown. The characteristics of the 
various types of contact forces illustrated in Fig. 3/1 are used in the four 
examples as they apply. 
In Example 1 the truss is composed of structural elements which, 
taken all together, constitute a rigid framework. Thus, we may remove 
the entire truss from its supporting foundation and treat it as a single 
rigid body. In addition to the applied external load P, the free-body dia­
gram must include the reactions on the truss at A and B. The rocker at 
B can support a vertical force only, and this force is transmitted to the 
structure at B (Example 4 of Fig. 3/1). The pin connection at A (Exam­
ple 6 of Fig. 3/1) is capable of supplying both a horizontal and a vertical 
force component to the truss. If the total weight of the truss members 
is appreciable compared with P and the forces at A and B, then the 
weights of the members must be included on the free-body diagram as 
external forces. 
In this relatively simple example it is clear that the vertical com­
ponent A, must be directed down to prevent the truss from rotating 
clockwise about B. Also, the horizontal component A, will be to the left 
to keep the truss from moving to the right under the influence of the 
horizontal component of P. Thus, in constructing the free-body diagram 
for this simple truss, we can easily perceive the correct sense of each of 
the components of force exerted on the truss by the foundation at A and 
can, therefore, represent its correct physical sense on the diagram. 
When the correct physical sense of a force or its component is not eas­
ily recognized by direct observation, it must be assigned arbitrarily, 
and the correctness of or error in the assignment is determined by the 
algebraic sign of its calculated value. 
In Example 2 the cantilever beam is secured to the wall and sub­
jected to three applied loads. When we isolate that part of the beam to 
the right of the section at A, we must include the reactive forces 
applied to the beam by the wall. The resultants of these reactive forces 
are shown acting on the section of the beam (Example 7 of Fig. 3/1). A 
vertical force V to counteract the excess of downward applied force is 
shown, and a tension F to balance the excess of applied force to the 
right must also be included. Then, to prevent the beam from rotating 
about A, a counterclockwise couple M is also required. The weight mg 
of the beam must be represented through the mass center (Example 8 
of Fig. 3/1). 
In the free-body diagram of Example 2, we have represented the 
somewhat complex system of forces which actually act on the cut sec­
tion of the beam by the equivalent force-couple system in which the 
force is broken down into its vertical component V (shear force) and its 
horizontal component F (tensile force). The couple M is the bending 
moment in the beam. The free-body diagram is now complete and 
shows the beam in equilibrium under the action of six forces and one 
couple. 
In Example 3 the weight W = mg is shown acting through the cen­
ter of mass of the beam, whose location is assumed known (Example 8 
of Fig. 3/1). The force exerted by the comer A on the beam is normal to 

Arti cle 3/2 System Isolat i o n  and the Free-Body Diagram 117 
the smooth surface of the beam (Example 2 of Fig. 3/1). To perceive 
this action more clearly, visualize an enlargement of the contact point A, 
which would appear somewhat rounded, and consider the force ex­
erted by this rounded corner on the straight surface of the beam, 
which is assumed to be smooth. If the contacting surfaces at the cor­
ner were not smooth, a tangential frictional component of force could 
exist. In addition to the applied force P and couple M, there is the pin 
connection at B, which exerts both an x- and a y-component of force 
on the beam. The positive senses of these components are assigned 
arbitrarily. 
In Example 4 the free-body diagram of the entire isolated mecha­
nism contains three unknown forces if the loads mg and P are known. 
Any one of many internal configurations for securing the cable leading 
from the mass m would be possible without affecting the external re­
sponse of the mechanism as a whole, and this fact is brought out by the 
free-body diagram. This hypothetical example is used to show that the 
forces internal to a rigid assembly of members do not influence the val­
ues of the external reactions. 
We use the free-body diagram in writing the equilibrium equa­
tions, which are discussed in the next article. When these equations 
are solved, some of the calculated force magnitudes may be zero. This 
would indicate that the assumed force does not exist. In Example 1 
of Fig. 3/2, any of the reactions Ax, Ay, or By can be zero for specific 
values of the truss geometry and of the magnitude, direction, and 
sense of the applied load P. A zero reaction force is often difficult to 
identifY by inspection, but can be determined by solving the equilib­
rium equations. 
Similar comments apply to calculated force magnitudes which 
are negative. Such a result indicates that the actual sense is the op­
posite of the assumed sense. The assumed positive senses of Bx and 
By in Example 3 and By in Example 4 are shown on the free-body dia­
grams. The correctness of these assumptions is proved or disproved 
according to whether the algebraic signs of the computed forces are 
plus or minus when the calculations are carried out in an actual 
problem. 
The isolation of the mechanical system under consideration is a 
crucial step in the formulation of the mathematical model. The most 
important aspect to the correct construction of the all-important free­
body diagram is the clcut and unambiguous decision as to what is 
included and what is excluded. This decision becomes unambiguous 
only when the boundary of the free-body diagram represents a com­
plete traverse of the body or system of bodies to be isolated, starting at 
some arbitrary point on the boundary and returning to that same 
point. The system within this closed boundary is the isolated free body, 
and all contact forces and all body forces transmitted to the system 
across the boundary must be accounted for. 
The following exercises provide practice with drawing free­
body diagrams. This practice is helpful before using such diagrams 
in the application of the principles of force equilibrium in the next 
article. 
Complex pulley systems are easily 
handled with a systematic equi librium 
analysis.

Article 3/3 Equili b r i um Conditions 121 
3/3 
EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS 
In Art. 3/1 we defined equilibrium as the condition in which the re­
sultant of all forces and moments acting on a body is zero. Stated in 
another way, a body is in equilibrium if all forces and moments applied 
to it are in balance. These requirements are contained in the vector 
equations of equilibrium, Eqs. 3/1, which in two dimensions may be 
written in scalar form as 
"'2:.Mo = 0 J 
(312) 
The third equation represents the zero sum of the moments of all forces 
about any point 0 on or off the body. Equations 3/2 are the necessary 
and sufficient conditions for complete equilibrium in two dimensions. 
They are necessary conditions because, if they are not satisfied, there can 
be no force or moment balance. They are sufficient because once they are 
satisfied, there can be no imbalance, and equilibrium is assured. 
The equations relating force and acceleration for rigid-body motion 
are developed in Vol. 2 Dynamics from Newton's second law of motion. 
These equations show that the acceleration of the mass center of a body 
is proportional to the resultant force "'2:.F acting on the body. Conse­
quently, if a body moves with constant velocity (zero acceleration), the 
resultant force on it must be zero, and the body may be treated as in a 
state of translational equilibrium. 
For complete equilibrium in two dimensions, all thre of Eqs. 3/2 
must hold. However, these conditions are independent requirements, 
and one may hold without another. Take, for example, a body which 
slides along a horizontal surface with increasing velocity under the ac­
tion of applied forces. The force-equilibrium equations wil be satisfied in 
the vertical direction where the acceleration is zero, but not in the hori­
zontal direction. Also, a body, such as a flywheel, which rotates about its 
fixed mass center with increasing angular speed is not in rotational equi­
librium, but the two force-equilibrium equations will be satisfied. 
Categories of Equilibrium 
Applications of Eqs. 3/2 fall naturally into a number of categories 
which are easily identified. The categories of force systems acting on 
bodies in two-dimensional equilibrium are summarized in Fig. 3/3 and 
are explained further as follows. 
Category 1, equilibrium of collinear forces, clearly requires only 
the one force equation in the direction of the forces (x-direction), since 
all other equations are automatically satisfied. 
Category 2, equilibrium of forces which lie in a plane (x-y plane) 
and are concurrent at a point 0, requires the two force equations only, 
since the moment sum about 0, that is, about a z-axis through 0, is nec­
essarily zero. Included in this category is the case of the equilibrium of a 
particle. 
Category 3, equilibrium of parallel forces in a plane, requires the 
one force equation in the direction of the forces {x-direction) and one mo­
ment equation about an axis (z-axis) normal to the plane of the forces.

Category 4, equilibrium of a general system of forces in a plane 
(x-y ), requires the two force equations in the plane and one moment 
equation about an axis (z-axis) normal to the plane. 
Two- and Three-Force Members 
You should be alert to two frequently occurring equilibrium situa­
tions. The first situation is the equilibrium of a body under the action 
of two forces only. Two examples are shown in Fig. 3/4, and we see 
that for such a two-force member to be in equilibrium, the forces must 
be equal, opposite, and collinear. The shape of the member does not af­
fect this simple requirement. In the illustrations cited, we consider the 
weights of the members to be negligible compared with the applied 
forces. 
The second situation is a three-force member, which is a body under 
the action of three forces, Fig. 3/5a. We see that equilibrium requires 
the lines of action of the three forces to be concurrent. If they were not 
concurrent, then one of the forces would exert a resultant moment 
about the point of intersection of the other two, which would violate the 
requirement of zero moment about every point. The only exception oc­
curs when the three forces are parallel. In this case we may consider 
the point of concurrency to be at infinity. 

Article 3/3 Equili b r i um Conditions 123 
The principle of the concurrency of three forces in equilibrium is of 
considerable use in carying out a graphical solution of the force equa­
tions. In this case the polygon of forces is drawn and made to close, as 
shown in Fig. 3/5b. Frequently, a body in equilibrium under the action 
of more than three forces may be reduced to a three-force member by a 
combination of two or more of the known forces. 
Alternative Equilibrium Equations 
In addition to Eqs. 3/2, there are two other ways to express the gen­
eral conditions for the equilibrium of forces in two dimensions. The first 
way is illustrated in Fig. 3/6, parts (a) and (b). For the body shown in 
Fig. 3/6a, if LMA = 0, then the resultant, if it still exists, cannot be a 
couple, but must be a force R passing through A. If now the equation 
'l:.Fx 
= 0 holds, where the x-direction is arbitrary, it follows from Fig. 
3/6b that the resultant force R, if it still exists, not only must pass 
through A, but also must be perpendicular to the x-direction as shown. 
Now, ifLM8 = 0, where B is any point such that the lineAB is not per­
pendicular to the x-direction, we see that R must be zero, and thus the 
body is in equilibrium. The.refore, an alternative set of equilibrium 
equations is 
!.F,. = 0 
where the two points A and B must not lie on a line perpendicular to the 
x-direction. 
A third formulation of the equilibrium conditions may be made for 
a coplanar force system. This is illustrated in Fig. 3/6, parts (c) and 
(d). Again, if 'l:.MA = 0 for any body such as that shown in Fig. 3/6c, the 
resultant, if any, must be a forceR through A. In addition, if T.M8 = 0, 
the resultant, if one still exists, must pass through B as shown in Fig. 
3/6d. Such a force cannot exist, however, if 'l:.Mc 
= 0, where Cis not

collinear with A and B .  Thus, we may write the equations of equilib­
rium as 
2-Mc = 0 
where A, B, and Care any three points not on the same straight line. 
When equilibrium equations are written which are not indepen­
dent, redundant information is obtained, and a correct solution of the 
equations will yield 0 = 0. For example, for a general problem in two di­
mensions with three unknowns, three moment equations written about 
three points which lie on the same straight line are not independent. 
Such equations will contain duplicated information, and solution of two 
of them can at best determine two of the unknowns, with the third 
equation merely verifying the identity 0 = 0. 
Constraints and Statical Detenninacy 
The equilibrium equations developed in this article are both neces­
sary and sufficient conditions to establish the equilibrium of a body. 
However, they do not necessarily provide all the information required 
to calculate al the unknown forces which may act on a body in equilib­
rium. Whether the equations are adequate to determine all the un­
knowns depends on the characteristics of the constraints against 
possible movement of the body provided by its supports. By constraint 
we mean the restriction of movement. 
In Example 4 of Fig. 3/1 the roller, ball, and rocker provide con­
straint normal to the surface of contact, but none tangent to the sur­
face. Thus, a tangential force cannot be supported. For the collar and 
slider of Example 5, constraint exists only normal to the guide. In Ex­
ample 6 the fixed-pin connection provides constraint in both directions, 
but offers no resistance to rotation about the pin unless the pin is not 
free to turn. The fixed support of Example 7, however, offers constraint 
against rotation as well as lateral movement. 
If the rocker which supports the truss of Example 1 in Fig. 3/2 were 
replaced by a pin joint, as at A, there would be one additional con­
straint beyond those required to support an equilibrium configuration 
with no freedom of movement. The three scalar conditions of equilib­
rium, Eqs. 3/2, would not provide sufficient information to determine 
all four unknowns, since Ax and Bx could not be solved for separately; 
only their sum could be determined. These two components of force 
would be dependent on the deformation of the members of the truss as 
infiuenced by their corresponding stiffness properties. The horizontal 
reactions Ax and Bx would also depend on any initial deformation re­
quired to fit the dimensions of the structure to those of the foundation 
between A and B. Thus, we cannot determine A., and Bx by a rigid-body 
an.alysis. 
Again referring to Fig. 3/2, we see that if the pin B in Example 3 
were not free to turn, the support could transmit a couple to the beam 
through the pin. Therefore, there would be four unknown supporting re­
actions acting on the beam-namely, the force at A, the two components 
of force at B, and the couple at B. Consequently the three independent 

Article 3/3 Equili b r i um Conditions 125 
scalar equations of equilibrium would not provide enough information to 
compute all four unknowns. 
A rigid body, or rigid combination of elements treated as a single 
body, which possesses more external supports or constraints than are 
necessary to maintain an equilibrium position is called statically inde­
terminate. Supports which can be removed without destroying the 
equilibrium condition of the body are said to be redundant. The num­
ber of redundant supporting elements present corresponds to the de­
gree of statical indeterminacy and equals the total number of unknown 
external forces, minus the number of available independent equations 
of equilibrium. On the other hand, bodies which are supported by the 
minimum number of constraints necessary to ensure an equilibrium 
configuration are called statically determinate, and for such bodies the 
equilibrium equations are sufficient to determine the unknown exter­
nal forces. 
The problems on equilibrium in this article and throughout Vol. 1 
Statics are generally restricted to statically determinate bodies 
where the constraints are just sufficient to ensure a stable equilib­
rium configuration and where the unknown supporting forces can be 
completely determined by the available independent equations of 
equilibrium. 
We must be aware of the nature of the constraints before we at­
tempt to solve an equilibrium problem. A body can be recognized as 
statically indeterminate when there are more unknown external reac­
tions than there are available independent equilibrium equations for 
the force system involved. It is always well to count the number of un­
known variables on a given body and to be certain that an equal num­
ber of independent equations can be written; otherwise, effort might be 
wasted in attempting an impossible solution with the aid of the equi­
librium equations only. The unknown variables may be forces, couples, 
distances, or angles. 
Adequacy of Constraints 
In discussin.g the relationship between constraints and equilibrium, 
we should look further at the question of the adequacy of constraints. 
The existence of three constraints for a two-dimensional problem does 
not always guarantee a stable equilibrium configuration. Figure 3/7 
shows four different types of constraints. In part a of the figure, point A 
of the rigid body is fixed by the two links and c.annot move, and the third 
link prevents any rotation about A. Thus, this body is completely fixed 
with three adequate (proper) constraints. 
In part b of the figure, the third link is positioned so that the force 
transmitted by it passes through point A where the other two constraint 
forces act. Thus, this configuration of constraints can offer no initial re­
sistance to rotation about A, which would occur when external loads 
were applied to the body. We conclude, therefore, that this body is in­
completely fixed under partial constraints. 
The configuration in part c of the figure gives us a similar condi­
tion of incomplete fixity because the three parallel links could offer no 
initial resistance to a small vertical movement of the body as a result

of external loads applied to it i n  this direction. The constraints i n  these 
two examples are often termed improper. 
In part d of Fig. 3n we have a condition of complete fixity, with link 
4 acting as a fourth constraint which is unnecessary to maintain a fixed 
position. Link 4, then, is a redundant constraint, and the body is stati­
cally indeterminate. 
As in the four examples of Fig. 317, it is generally possible by direct 
observation to conclude whether the constraints on a body in two­
dimensional equilibrium are adequate (proper), partial (improper), or 
redundant. As indicated previously, the vast majority of problems in this 
book are statically determinate with adequate (proper) constraints. 
APP ROACH TO SO LVING P R O B LEMS 
The sample problems at the end of this article illustrate the application 
of free-body diagrams and the equations of equilibrium to typical statics 
problems. These solutions should be studied thoroughly. In the problem 
work of this chapter and throughout mechanics, it is important to de­
velop a logical and systematic approach which includes the following 
steps: 
1. Identify clearly the quantities which are known and unknown. 
2. Make an unambiguous choice of the body (or system of connected 
bodies treated as a single body) to be isolated and draw its complete 
free-body diagram, labeling all external known and unknown but 
identifiable forces and couples which act on it. 
3. Choose a convenient set of reference axes, always using right­
handed axes when vector cross products are employed. Choose mo­
ment centers with a view to simplifying the calculations. Generally 
the best choice is one through which as many unknown forces pass 
as possible. Simultaneous solutions of equilibrium equations are 
frequently necessary, but can be minimized or avoided by a careful 
choice of reference axes and moment centers. 
4. Identify and state the applicable force and moment principles or 
equations which govern the equilibrium conditions of the problem. 
In the following sample problems these relations are shown in 
brackets and precede each major calculation. 
5. Match the number of independent equations with the number of 
unknowns in each problem. 
6. Carry out the solution and check the results. In many problems en­
gineering judgment can be developed by first making a reasonable 
guess or estimate of the result prior to the calculation and then 
comparing the estimate with the calculated value.

Solution II (scalar algebra). To avoid a simultaneous solution, we may use axes 
® x' -y' with the first summation in the y' -direction to eliminate reference to T. Thus, 
[:LF.r· = 0]

C = 3.03 kN 
Ans. 
[:LF.,. = 0] 
T + 8 cos 40° - 16 cos 40° - 3 sin 40° - 3.03 sin 20° = 0 
T =  9.09 kN 
Ans. 
Solution Il (vector algebra). With unit vec:tors i and j in the x- and y-direc­
tions, the zero summation of forces for equilibrium yields the ve<:tor equation 
[:LF = O] 
8i + (T cos 40°)i + (T sin 40°)j - 3j + (C sin 20°)i 
- (C cos 20°)j - 16i = 0 
Equating the coefficients of the i- and j-terms to zero gives 
8 + T cos 400 + C sin 20° - 16 = 0 
T sin 400 - 3 - C cos 200 = 0 
which are the same, of course, as Eqs. (a) and (b), which we solved above. 
Solution IV (geometric). 
The polygon representing the zero vector sum of 
the five forces is shown. Equations (a) and (b) are seen immediately to give the 
projections of the vectors onto the x- and y-directions. Similarly, projections onto 
the x'- and y'-directions give the alternative equations in Solution II. 
A graphical solution is easily obtained. The known vectors are laid off head-
@ to-tail to some convenient scale, and the directions ofT and C are then drawn to 
close the polygon. The resulting intersection at point P completes the solution, 
thus enabling us to measure the ma&tzritudes of T and C directly from the draw­
ing to whatever degree of accuracy we incorporate in the construction. 
® The selection of reference axes to fa­
cilitate computation is always an im­
portant consideration. Alternatively 
in this example we could take a set 
of axes along and normal to the di­
rection of C and employ a force sum­
mation normal to C to eliminate it.

The uniform 100-kg 1-beam is supported initially by its end rollers on the 
horizontal surface at A and B. By means of the cable at C, it is desired to elevate 
end B to a position 3 m  above end A. Determine the required tension P, the reac­
tion at A, and the angle 8 made by the beam with the horizontal in the elevated 
position. 
Solution. In constructing the free-body diagram, we note that the reaction on 
the roller at A and the weight are vertical forces. Consequently, in the absence of 
other horizontal forces, P must also be vertical. From Sample Problem 3/2 we 
see immediately that the tension P in the cable equals the tension P applied to 
the beam at C.

Sample Problem 3/4 
Determine the magnitude T of the tension in the supporting cable and the 
magnitude of the force on the pin at A for the jib crane shown. The beam AB is a 
standard 0.5-m 1-beam with a mass of95 kg per meter oflength. 
Algebraic solution. The system is symmetrical about the vertical :N-Y plane 
through the center of the beam, so the problem may be analyzed as the equilib­
rium of a coplanar force system. The free-body dia&Tam of the beam is shown in 
the figure with the pin reaction at A represented in terms of its two rectangular 
components. The weight of the beam is 95(10-3)(5)9.81 = 4.66 kN and acts 
through its center. Note that there are thre unknowns A..,, A>'' and T, which may 
be found from the three equations of equilibrium. We begin with a moment 
equation about A, which eliminates two of the three unknowns from the equa-
(j) tion. In applying the moment equation about A, it is simpler to consider the mo­
ments of the x- and y-components of T than it is to compute the perpendicular 
distance from T to .A. Hence, with the counterclockwise sense as positive we 
write 
(T cos 25°)0.25 + (T sin 25°)(5 - 0.12)

Ans. 
Graphical solution. The principle that three forces in equilibrium must be 
concurrent is utilized for a graphical solution by combining the two known verti· 
cal forces of 4.66 and 10 kN into a single 14.66-k.N force, located as shown on the 
modified free-body diagram of the beam in the lower figure. The position of this 
resultant load may easily be determined graphically or algebraically. The inter­
section of the 14.66-kN force with the line of action of the unknown tension T 
defines the point of concurrency 0 through which the pin reaction A must pass. 
The unknown magnitudes of T and A may now be found by adding the forces 
bead-to-tail to form the closed equilibrium polygon of forces, thus satisfying 
their zero vector sum. After the known vertical load is laid off to a convenient 
scale, as shown in the lower part of the figure, a line representing the given di­
rection of the tension T is drawn through the tip of the 14.66-kN vector. Like­
wise a line representing the direction of the pin reaction A, determined from the 
concurrency established with the fre-body diagram, is drawn through the tail of 
the 14.66-k.N vector. The intersection of the lines representing vectors T and A 
establishes the magnitudes T and A necessary to make the vector sum of the 
forces equal to zero. These magnitudes are scaled from the diagram. The x· and 
y-components of A may be constructed on the force polygon if desired. 
(j) The justification for this step is 
Varignon's theorem, explained in 
Art. 2/4. Be prepared to take full ad­
vantage of this principle frequently. 
Û The calculation of moments in two­
dimensional problems is generally 
handled more simply by scalar alge­
bra than by the vector cross product 
r X F. In thre dimensions, as we will 
see later, the reverse is often the case. 
@ The direction of the force at A could 
be easily calculated if desired. How­
ever, in designing the pin A or in 
checking its strength, it is only the 
magnitude of the force that matters.

couple on a body in equilibrium be zero. These two vector equations of 
equilibrium and their scalar components may be written as 
6F = O  
or 
6M = O  
or 
{x = 0 
y = O 
z = O 
{M:c = 0 
};My = 0 
Mz = 0 
(313) 
The first three scalar equations state that there is no resultant force act­
ing on a body in equilibrium in any of the three coordinate directions. 
The second three scalar equations express the further equilibrium re­
quirement that there be no resultant moment acting on the body about 
any of the coordinate axes or about axes parallel to the cordinate axes. 
These six equations are both necessary and sufficient conditions for com­
plete equilibrium. The reference axes may be chosen arbitrarily as a 
matter of convenience, the only restriction being that a right-handed co­
ordinate system should be chosen when vector notation is used. 
The six scalar relationships of Eqs. 3/3 are independent conditions 
because any of them can be valid without the others. For example, for a 
car which accelerates on a straight and level road in the x-direction, 
Newton's second law tells us that the resultant force on the car equals 
its mass times its acceleration. Thus "LF:c # 0, but the remaining two 
force-equilibrium equations are satisfied because al other acceleration 
components are zero. Similarly, if the flywheel of the engine of the 
accelerating car is rotating with increasing angular speed about the 
x-axis, it is not in rotational equilibrium about this axis. Thus, for the fly­
wheel alone, 6M. 'i" 0 along with ȷF:c 'i" 0, but the remaining four 
equilibrium equations for the flywheel would be satisfied for its mass­
center axes. 
In applying the vector form of Eqs. 3/3, we first express each of the 
forces in terms of the coordinate unit vectors i, j, and k. For the first 
equation, "LF = 0, the vector sum will be zero only if the coefficients of i, 
j ,  and k in the expression are, respectively, zero. These three sums, 
when each is set equal to zero, yield precisely the three scalar equations 
of equilibrium,  .. 
= 0, aFy = 0, and aFz = 0. 
For the second equation, "LM = 0, where the moment sum may be 
taken about any convenient point 0, we express the moment of each 
force as the cross product r x F, where r is the position vector from 0 to 
any point on the line of action of the force F. Thus "LM = 6(r x F) = 0. 

144 Chapter 3 E q u i l i b r i u m  
When the coefficients of i, j, and k in the resulting moment equation are 
set equal to zero, respectively, we obtain the three scalar moment equa­
tions !Mx = 0, !.My = 0, and !Mz = 0. 
Free-Body Diagrams 
The summations in Eqs. 3/3 include the effects of all forces on the 
body under consideration. We learned in the previous article that the 
free-body diagram is the only reliable method for disclosing all forces 
and moments which should be included in our equilibrium equations. In 
three dimensions the free-body diagram serves the same essential pur­
pose as it does in two dimensions and should always be drawn. We have 
our choice either of drawing a pictorial view of the isolated body with all 
external forces represented or of drawing the orthogonal projections of 
the free-body diagram. Both representations are illustrated in the sam­
ple problems at the end of this article. 
The correct representation of forces on the free-body diagram re­
quires knowledge of the characteristics of contacting surfaces. These char­
acteristics were described in Fig. 3/1 for two-dimensional problems, and 
their extension to three-dimensional problems is represented in Fig. 3/8 
for the most common situations of force transmission. The representa­
tions in both Figs. 3/1 and 3/8 will be used in three..dimensional analysis. 
The essential purpose of the free-body diagram is to develop a reli­
able picture of the physical action of all forces (and couples if any) acting 
on a body. So it is helpful to represent the forces in their correct physi­
cal sense whenever possible. In this way, the free-body diagram becomes 
a closer model to the actual physical problem than it would be if the 
forces were arbitrarily assigned or always assigned in the same mathe­
matical sense as that of the assigned coordinate axis. 
For example, in part 4 of Fig. 3/8, the correct sense of the unknowns 
Rx and Ry may be known or perceived to be in the sense opposite to those 
of the assigned cordinate axes. Similar conditions apply to the sense of 
couple vectors, parts 5 and 6, where their sense by the right-hand rule 
may be assigned opposite to that of the respective cordinate direction. By 
this time, you should recognize that a negative answer for an unknown 
force or couple vector merely indicates that its physical action is in the 
sense opposite to that asigned on the free-body diagram. Frequently, of 
course, the correct physical sense is not known initially, so that an arbi­
trary assignment on the free-body diagram becomes necessary. 
Categories of Equilibrium 
Application of Eqs. 3/3 falls into four categories which we identify 
with the aid of Fig. 3/9. These categories differ in the number and type 
(force or moment) of independent equilibrium equations required to 
solve the problem. 
Category 1, equilibrium of forces all concurrent at point 0, re­
quires all three force equations, but no moment equations because the 
moment of the forces about any axis through 0 is zero. 
Category 2, equilibrium of forces which are concurrent with a line, 
requires all equations except the moment equation about that line, 
which is automatic.ally satisfied.

Category 3, equilibrium of parallel forces, requires only one force 
equation, the one in the direction of the forces (x-direction as shown), 
and two moment equations about the axes (y and z) which are normal 
to the direction of the forces. 
Category 4, equilibrium of a general system of forces, requires all 
three force equations and al three moment equations. 
The obseiVations contained in these statements are generally quite 
evident when a given problem is being solved. 
Constraints and Statical Detenninacy 
The six scalar relations of Eqs. 3/3, although necessary and suffi­
cient conditions to establish equilibrium, do not necessarily provide all 
of the information required to calculate the unknown forces acting in a 
three-dimensional equilibrium situation. Again, as we found with two 
dimensions, the question of adequacy of information is decided by the 

Article 3/4 Equili b r i um Conditions 147 
characteristics of the constraints provided by the supports. An analyti­
cal criterion for determining the adequacy of constraints is available, 
but it is beyond the scope of this treatment.* In Fig. 3/10, however, we 
cite four examples of constraint conditions to alert the reader to the 
problem. 
Part a of Fig. 3/10 shows a rigid body whose corner point A is com­
pletely fixed by the links 1, 2, and 3. Links 4, 5, and 6 prevent rotations 
about the axes of links 1, 2, and 3, respectively, so that the body is com­
pletely fixed and the constraints are said to be adequate. Part b of the fig­
ure shows the same number of constraints, but we se that they provide 
no resistance to a moment which might be applied about axis AE. Here 
the body is incompletely fixed and only partially constrained. 
Similarly, in Fig. 3/lOc the constraints provide no resistance to an 
unbalanced force in the y-direction, so here also is a case of incomplete 
fixity with partial constraints. In Fig. 3/lOd, if a seventh constraining 
link were imposed on a system of six constraints placed properly for 
complete fixity, more supports would be provided than would be neces­
sary to establish the equilibrium position, and link 7 would be redun­
dant. The body would then be statically indeterminate with such a 
seventh link in place. With only a few exceptions, the supporting con­
straints for rigid bodies in equilibrium in this book are adequate, and 
the bodies are statically determinate. 
The three-dimensional equilibrium of the cell-phone tower must be care­
fully analyzed so that excessive net horizontal force applied by the cable 
system is avoided.

Sample Problem 3/5 
The uniform 7-m steel shaft has a mass of200 kg and is supported by a ball­
and-socket joint at A in the horizontal floor. The ball end B rests against the 
smooth vertical walls as shown. Compute the forces exerted by the walls and the 
floor on the ends of the shaft. 
Solution. The fre-body diagram of the shaft is first drawn where the contact 
forces acting on the shaft at B are shown normal to the wall surfaces. In addition 
to the weight W = mg = 200(9.81) = 1962 N, the force exerted by the floor on 
the ball joint at A is represented by its x-, y-, and z-components. These compo-
CD nents are shown in their correct physical sense, as should be evident from the re-

the forces at A. The position vectors needed to compute the moments about A are 
rAa = -li - 3j + 1.5k m 
and 
rAB = -2i - 6j + 3k m 
where the mass center G is located halfway between A and B.

positive mathematical sense, in which 
case A,. and Ay would turn out to be

to show the forces in their correct

<2:) Note that the third equation -2B.Y + 
6B" = 0 merely checks the results of 
the first two equations. This result 
could be anticipated from the fact 
that an equilibrium system of forces 
concurrent with a line requires only 
two moment equations (Category 2 
under Categories of Equilibrium). 
@ We observe that a moment sum 
about an axis through A parallel to 
the z-axis merely gives us 6B, -
2By = 0, which serves only as a 
check as noted previously. Alterna­
tively we could have first obtained 
Az from ¬Fz = 0 and then taken 
our moment equations about axes 
through B to obtain A, and Ay.

Sample Problem 3/6 
A 200-N force is applied to the handle of the hoist in the direction shown. 
The bearing A supports the thrust (force in the direction of the shaft axis), while 
bearing B supports only radial load (load normal to the shaft axis). Determine 
the mass m which can be supported and the total radial force exerted on the 
shaft by each bearing. Assume neither bearing to be capable of supporting a mo­
ment about a line normal to the shaft axis. 
Solution. The system is clearly three-dimensional with no lines or planes of 
symmetry, and therefore the problem must be analyzed as a general space sys­
tem of forces. A scalar solution is used here to illustrate this approach, although 
a solution using vector notation would also be satisfactory. The free-body dia· 
gram of the shaft, lever, and drum considered a single body could be shown by a 
CD space view if desired, but is represented here by its three orthogonal projections. 
The 20Q.N force is resolved into its thre components, and each of the thre 
views shows two of these components. The correct directions of A| and Bx may be 
sen by inspection by observing that the line of action of the resultant of the two 
70.7-N forces passes between A and B. The correct sense of the forces Ay and By 
cannot be determined until the magnitudes of the moments are obtained, so they 
are arbitrarily assigned. The x-y projection of the bearing forces is shown in 
terms of the sums of the unknown x- and y-components .. The addition of A. and 
the weight W = mg completes the free-body diagrams. It should be noted that 
the thr"O views represent three two-dimensional problems related by the corre­
sponding components of the forces.

The welded tubular frame is secured to the horizontal x-y plane by a ball­
and-socket joint at A and receives support from the loose-fitting ring at B. Under

CHAPTER REVIEW 
In Chapter 3 we have applied our knowledge of the properties of forces, 
moments, and couples studied in Chapter 2 to solve problems involving rigid 
bodies in equilibrium. Complete equilibrium of a body requires that the vector 
resultant of all forces acting on it be zero (6F = 0) and the vector resultant 
of all moments on the body about a point (or axis) also be zero CaM = 0). We 
are guided in all of our solutions by these two requirements, which are easily 
comprehended physically. 
Frequently, it is not the theory but its application which presents difficulty. 
The crucial steps in applying our principles of equilibrium should be quite 
familiar by now. They are: 
1. Make an unequivocal decision as to which system (a body or collection of 
bodies) in equilibrium is to be analyzed. 
2. Isolate the system in question from all contacting bodies by drawing its 
free-body diagram showing all forces and couples acting on the isolated 
system from external sources. 
3. Observe the principle of action and reaction (Newton's third law) when 
assigning the sense of each force. 
4. Label all forces and couples, known and unknown. 
5. Choose and label reference axes, always choosing a right-handed set 
when vector notation is used (which is usually the case for three­
dimensional analysis). 
6. Check the adequacy of the constraints (supports) and match the number 
of unknowns with the number of available independent equations of 
equilibrium. 
When solving an equilibrium problem, we should first check to see 
that the body is statically determinate. If there are more supports than are 
necessary to hold the body in place, the body is statically indeterminate, 
and the equations of equilibrium by themselves will not enable us to solve 
for all of the external reactions. In applying the equations of equilibrium, 
we choose scalar algebra, vector algebra, or graphical analysis according to 
both preference and experience; vector algebra is particularly useful for many 
three-dimensional problems. 
The algebra of a solution can be simplified by the choice of a moment 
axis which eliminates as many unknowns as possible or by the choice of a 
direction for a force summation which avoids reference to certain unknowns. 
A few moments ofthought to take advantage of these simplifications can save 
appreciable time and effort. 
The principles and methods covered in Chapters 2 and 3 constitute the 
most basic part of statics. They lay the foundation for what follows not only in 
statics but in dynamics as well.

INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 3 we studied the equilibrium of a single rigid body or a 
system of connected members treated as a single rigid body. We first 
drew a free-body diagram of the body showing all forces external to the 
isolated body, and then we applied the force and moment equations of 
equilibrium. In Chapter 4 we focus on the determination of the forces in­
ternal to a structure-that is, forces of action and reaction between the 
connected members. An engineering structure is any connected system 
of members built to support or transfer forces and to safely withstand 
the loads applied to it. To determine the forces internal to an engineering 
structure, we must dismember the structure and analyze separate free­
body diagram of individual members or combinations of members. Thi 
analysis requires careful application of 
ewton's third law, which states 
that each action is accompanied by an equal and opposite reaction. 
In Chapter 4 we analyze the internal forces acting in several types 
of structures-namely, trusses, frames, and machines. In this treatment 
we consider only statically determinate structures, which do not have 
more supporting constraints than are necessary to maintain an equilib­
rium configuration. Thu , as we have already seen, the equations of 
equilibrium are adequate to determine al unknown reactions. 
The analysis of trusses, frames and machines, and beams under con­
centrated loads constitutes a straightforward application of the material 
developed in the previous two chapters. The basic procedure developed 
in Chapter 3 for isolating a body by constructing a correct free-body dia­
gram is essential for the analysis of statically determinate structures.

PLANE TRUSSES 
A framework composed of members joined at their ends to form a 
rigid structure is called a truss. Bridges, roof supports, derricks, and 
other such structures are common examples of trusses. Structural mem­
bers commonly used are !-beams, channels, angles, bars, and special 
shapes which are fastened together at their ends by welding, riveted 
connections, or large bolts or pins. When the members of the truss lie 
essentially in a single plane, the truss is called a plane truss. 
For bridges and similar structures, plane trusses are commonly uti­
lized in pairs with one truss assembly placed on each side of the struc­
ture. A section of a typical bridge structure is shown in Fig. 4/1. The 
combined weight of the roadway and vehicles is transferred to the longi­
tudinal stringers, then to the cross beams, and finally, with the weights 
of the stringers and cro s beams accounted for, to the upper joints of the 
two plane trusses which form the vertical sides of the structure. A sim­
plified model of the truss structure is indicated at the left side of the 
illustration; the forces L represent the joint loadings. 
Several examples of commonly used trusses which can be analyzed 
as plane trusses are shown in schematic form in Fig. 4/2. 
Simple Trusses 
The basic element of a plane truss is the triangle. Three bars joined 
by pins at their ends, Fig. 413a, constitute a rigid frame. The term rigid 
is used to mean noncollapsible and also to mean that deformation of the 
members due to induced internal strains is negligible. On the other 
hand, four or more bars pin-jointed to form a polygon of as many sides 
constitute a nonrigid frame. We can make the nonrigid frame in Fig. 413b 
rigid, or stable, by adding a diagonal bar joining A and D orB and C and 
thereby formin.g two triangles. We can extend the structure by adding 
additional units of two end-connected bars, such as DE and CE or AF 
and DF, Fig. 4/3c, which are pinned to two fixed joints. In this way the 
entire structure will remain rigid. 
Structures built from a basic triangle in the manner described are 
known as simple trusses. W hen more members are present than are 
needed to prevent collapse, the truss is statically indeterminate. A stat­
ically indeterminate truss cannot be analyzed by the equations of equi­
librium alone. Additional members or supports which are not necessary 
for maintaining the equilibrium configuration are called redundant. 
To design a truss, we must first determine the forces in the various 
member: and then select appropriate sizes and structural shapes to 
withstand the forces. Several assumptions are made in the force analy­
sis of simple trusses. First, we assume all members to be two-force mem­
bers. A two-force member is one in equilibrium under the action of two 
forces only, as defined in general terms with Fig. 3/4 in Art. 3/3. Each 
member of a truss is normally a straight link joining the two points of 
application of force. The two forces are applied at the ends of the mem­
ber and are necessarily equal, opposite, and collinear for equilibrium. 
The member may be in tension or compression, as shown in Fig. 4/4. 
When we represent the equilibrium of a portion of a two-force member, 
the tension T or compression C acting on the cut section is the same

for all sections. We assume here that the weight of the member is small 
compared with the force it supports. If it is not, or if we must account 
for the small effect of the weight, we can replace the weight W of the 
member by two forces, each W/2 if the member is uniform, with one 
force acting at each end of the member. These forces, in effect, are 
treated as loads externally applied to the pin connections. Accounting 
for the weight of a member in this way gives the correct result for the 
average tension or compression along the member but will not account 
for the effect of bending of the member. 
Truss Connections and Supports 
When welded or riveted connections are used to join structural 
members, we may usually assume that the connection is a pin joint if 
the centerlines of the members are concurrent at the joint as in Fig. 4/5. 
We also assume in the analysis of simple trusses that all external 
forces are applied at the pin connections. This condition is satisfied in 
most trusses. In bridge trusses the deck is usually laid on cross beams 
which are supported at the joints, as shown in Fig. 411. 
For large trusses, a roller, rocker, or some kind of slip joint is used 
at one of the supports to provide for expansion and contraction due to 
temperature changes and for deformation from applied loads. Trusses 
and frames in which no such provision is made are statically indetermi­
nate, as explained in Art. 3/3. Figure 3/1 shows examples of such joints. 
Two methods for the force analysis of simple trusses wil be given. 
Each method will be explained for the simple truss shown in Fig. 416a. 
The free-body diagram of the truss as a whole is shown in Fig. 4/6b. The 
external reactions are usually determined first, by applying the equilib­
rium equations to the truss as a whole. Then the force analysis of the re­
mainder of the truss is performed. 
4/3 
METHOD OF JOINTS 
This method for finding the forces in the members of a truss con­
sists of satisfying the conditions of equilibrium for the forces acting on 
the connecting pin of each joint. The method therefore deals with the 
equilibrium of concurrent forces, and only two independent equilibrium 
equations are involved. 
We begin the analysis with any joint where at least one known load 
exists and where not more than two unknown forces are present. The 
solution may be started with the pin at the left end. Its free-body dia­
gram is shown in Fig. 4/7. With the joints indicated by letters, we usu­
ally designate the force in each member by the two letters defining the 
ends of the member. The proper directions of the forces should be evi­
dent by inspection for this simple case. The free-body diagrams of por­
tions of members AF and AB are also shown to clearly indicate the 
mechanism of the action and reaction. The member AB actually makes 
contact on the left side of the pin, although the force AB is drawn from 
the right side and is shown acting away from the pin. Thus, if we consis­
tently draw the force arrows on the same side of the pin as the member, 
then tension (such as AB) wil always be indicated by an arrow away 

&om the pin, and compression (such as AF) wil always be indicated by 
an arrow toward the pin. The magnitude of AF is obtained from the 
equation 'i-Fy = 0 and AB is then found from !F" = 0. 
Joint F may be analyzed next, since it now contains only two un­
knowns, EF and BF. Proceeding to the next joint having no more than 
two unknowns, we subsequently analyze joints B, C, E, and D in that 
order. Figure 4/8 shows the free-body diagram of each joint and its cor­
responding force polygon, which represents graphically the two equilib­
rium conditions 2-F, = 0 and 2-Fy = 0. The numbers indicate the order in 
which the joints are analyzed. We note that, when joint D is finally 
reached, the computed reaction R2 must be in equilibrium with the 
forces in members CD and ED, which were determined previously &om 
the two neighboring joints. This requirement provides a check on the 
correctness of our work. 
ote that isolation of joint C shows that the 
force in CE is zero when the equation LFy "'" 0 is applied. The force in

this member would not be zero, of course, if an external vertical load 
were applied at C. 
It is often convenient to indicate the tension T and compression C of 
the various members directly on the original truss diagram by drawing 
arrows away from the pins for tension and toward the pins for compres­
sion. This designation is illustrated at the bottom of Fig. 4/8. 
Sometimes we cannot initially assign the correct direction of one or 
both of the unknown forces acting on a given pin. If so, we may make an 
arbitrary assignment. A negative computed force value indicates that 
the initially assumed direction is incorrect. 
Internal and External Redundancy 
If a plane truss has more external supports than are necessary to 
ensure a stable equilibrium configuration, the truss as a whole is stati­
cally indeterminate, and the extra supports constitute external redun­
dancy. If a truss has more internal members than are necessary to 
prevent collapse when the truss is removed from its supports, then the 
extra members constitute internal redundancy and the truss is again 
statically indeterminate. 
For a trus which is statically determinate externally, there is a def­
inite relation between the number of its members and the number of its 
joints necessary for internal stability without redundancy. Because we 
can specify the equilibrium of each joint by two scalar force equations, 
there are in a112j such equations for a truss withj joints. For the entire 
truss composed of m two-force members and having the maximum of 
three unknown support reactions, there are in all m + 3 unknowns 
(m tension or compression forces and three reactions). Thus, for any plane 
truss, the equation m + 3 = 2j wil be satisfied if the truss is statically 
determinate internally. 
A simple plane truss, formed by starting with a triangle and adding 
two new members to locate each new joint with respect to the existing 
structure, satisfies the relation automatically. The condition holds for 
the initial triangle, where m 
= j 
= 3, and m increases by 2 for each 
added joint whilej increases by 1. Some other (nonsimple) staticaly de­
terminate trusses, such as the K-truss in Fig. 4/2, are arranged differ­
ently, but can be seen to satisfY the same relation. 
This equation is a necessary condition for stability but it is not 
a sufficient condition, since one or more of the m members can be 
arranged in such a way as not to contribute to a stable configuration of 
the entire truss. If m + 3 > 2j, there are more members than indepen­
dent equations, and the truss is statically indeterminate internally 
with redundant members present.lf m + 3 < 2j, there is a deficiency of 
internal members, and the truss is unstable and will collapse under 
load. 
Special Conditions 
We often encounter several special conditions in the analysis of 
trusses. When two collinear members are under compression, as indi­
cated in Fig. 419a, it is necessary to add a third member to maintain 

EFy = 0 requires .z;:3 = 0 
T = 0 requires F1 = F2 
(a) 
r.Fz = 0 requires F1 = 0 
I.F.,. = 0 requires F2 = 0 
(b) 
Figure 4/9 
alignment of the two members and prevent buckling. We see from a 
force summation in they-direction that the force F3 in the third mem­
ber must be zero and from the x-direction that F1 = F2• This conclusion 
holds regardless of the angle (} and holds also if the collinear members 
are in tension. If an external force with a component in they-direction 
were applied to the joint, then F3 would no longer be zero. 
When two noncollinear members are joined as shown in Fig. 419b, 
then in the absence of an externally applied load at this joint, the 
forces in both members must be zero, as we can see from the two force 
summations. 
When two pairs of collinear members are joined as shown in Fig. 419c, 
the forces in each pair must be equal and opposite. This conclusion 
follows from the force summations indicated in the figure. 
Truss panels are frequently cross-braced as shown in Fig. 4/lOa. 
Such a panel is static.ally indeterminate if each brace can support 
either tension or compression. However, when the braces are flexible 
members incapable of supporting compression, as are cables, then only 
the tension member acts and we can disregard the other member. It is 
usually evident from the asymmetry of the loading how the panel will 
deflect. If the deflection is as indicated in Fig. 4/lOb, then member AB 
should be retained and CD disregarded. When this choice cannot be 
made by inspection, we may arbitrarily select the member to be re­
tained. If the assumed tension turns out to be positive upon calcula­
tion, then the choice was correct. If the assumed tension force turns 
out to be negative, then the opposite member must be retained and 
the calculation redone. 
We can avoid simultaneous solution of the equilibrium equations 
for two unknown forces at a joint by a careful choice of reference axes. 
Thus, for the joint indicated schematically in Fig. 4/11 where L is  known 
and F1 and F2 are unknown, a force summation in the x-direction elimi­
nates reference to F1 and a force summation in the x'-direction elimi­
nates refe.rence to F2• When the angles involved are not easily found, 
then a simultaneous solution of the equations using one set of reference 
directions for both unknowns may be preferable.

The simple truss shown supports the two loads, each of magnitude L. De· 
termine the forces in members DE, DF, DG, and CD. 
Solution. First of all, we note that the curved members of this simple truss 
are all two-force members, so that the effect of each curved member within the 
truss is the same as that of a straight member. 
We can begin with joint E because there are only two unknown member 
forces acting there. With reference to the free-body diagram and accompanying 
geometry for joint E, we note that {3 = 180" - 11.25" - 90" = 78.8°.

GF = 0.646L T

METHOD OF SECTIONS 
When analyzing plane trusses by the method of joints, we need only 
two of the three equilibrium equations because the procedures involve 
concurrent forces at each joint. We can take advantage of the third or 
moment equation of equilibrium by selecting an entire section of the 
truss for the free body in equilibrium under the action of a nonconcur­
rent system of forces. This method of sections has the basic advantage 
that the force in almost any desired member may be found directly from 
an analysis of a section which has cut that member. Thus, it is not nec­
essary to proceed with the calculation from joint to joint until the mem­
ber in question has been reached. In choosing a section of the truss, we 
note that, in general, not more than three members whose forces are 
unknown should be cut, since there are only three available indepen­
dent equilibrium relations. 
Illustration of the Method 
The method of sections will now be illustrated for the truss in Fig. 
4/6, which was used in the explanation of the method of joints. The truss 
is shown again in Fig. 4/12a for ready reference. The external reactions 
are first computed as with the method of joints, by considering the truss 
as a whole. 
Let us determine the force in the member BE, for example. An 
imaginary section, indicated by the dashed line, is passed through the 
truss, cutting it into two parts, Fig. 4/12b. This section has cut three 
members whose forces are initially unknown. In order for the portion of 
the truss on each side of the section to remain in equilibrium, it is nec­
essary to apply to each cut member the force which was exerted on it by 
the member cut away. For simple trusses composed of straight two-force 
members, these forces, either tensile or compressive, will alway s be in 
the directions of the respective members. The left-hand section is in 
equilibrium under the action of the applied load L, the end reaction R11 
and the three forces exerted on the cut members by the right-hand sec­
tion which has been removed. 
We can usually draw the forces with their proper senses by a visual 
approximation of the equilibrium requirements. Thus, in balancing the 
moments about point B for the left-hand section, the force EF is clearly 
to the left, which makes it compressive, because it acts toward the cut 
section of member EF. The load L is greater than the reaction Rl> so 
that the force BE must be up and to the right to supply the needed up­
ward component for vertical equilibrium. Force BE is therefore tensile, 
since it acts away from the cut section. 
With the approximate magnitudes of R1 and L in mind, we see that 
the balance of moments about pointE requires that BC be to the right. A 
casual glance at the truss should lead to the same conclusion when it is 
realized that the lower horizontal member will stretch under the tension 
caused by bending. The equation of moments about joint B eliminates 
thre forces from the relation, and EF can be determined directly. The 
force BE is calculated from the equilibrium equation for they-direction. 
Finally, we determine BC by balancing moments about point E. In this 

way each of the three unknowns has been determined independently of 
the other two. 
The right-hand section of the truss, Fig. 4/l2b, is in equilibrium 
under the action of R2 and the same three forces in the cut members ap­
plied in the directions opposite to those for the left section. The proper 
sense for the horizontal forces can easily be seen from the balance of 
moments about points Band E. 
Additional Considerations 
It is essential to understand that in the method of sections an entire 
portion of the truss is considered a single body in equilibrium. Thus, the 
forces ·n members internal to the section are not involved ·n the analy­
sis of the section as a whole. To clarify the free body and the forces act­
ing externally on it, the cutting section is preferably passed through the 
members and not the joints. We may use either portion of a truss for the 
calculations, but the one involving the smaller number of forces will 
usually yield the simpler solution. 
In some cases the methods of sections and joints can be combined 
for an efficient solution. For example, suppose we wish to find the force 
in a central member of a large truss. Furthermore, suppose that it is not 
possible to pass a section through this member without passing through 
at least four unknown members. It may be possible to determine the 
forces in nearby members by the method of sections and then progress 
to the unknown member by the method of joints. Such a combination of 
the two methods may be more expedient than exclusive use of either 
method. 
The moment equations are used to great advantage in the method 
of sections. One should choose a moment center, either on or off the sec­
tion, through which as many unknown forces as possible pass. 
It is not always possible to assign the proper sense of an unknown 
force when the free-body diagram of a section is initially drawn. Once an 
arbitrary assignment is made, a positive answer will verify the assumed 
sense, and a negative result will indicate that the force is in the sense op­
posite to that assumed. An alternative notation preferred by some is to 
assign all unknown forces arbitrarily as positive in the tension direction 
(away from the section) and let the algebraic sign of the answer distin­
guish between tension and compression. Thus, a plus sign would signify 
tension and a minus sign compression. On the other hand, the advan­
tage of assigning forces in their correct sense on the free-body diagram 
of a section wherever possible is that doing o emphasizes the physical 
action of the forces more directly. This practice is the one which is pre­
ferred here.

Sample Problem 4/3 
Calculate the forces induced in members KL, CL, and CB by the 200-kN 
load on the cantilever truss. 
Solution. Although the vertical components of the reactions at A and M are 
statically indeterminate with the two fixed supports, all members other than AM 
are statically determinate. We may pass a section directly through members KL, 
CL, and CB and analyze the portion of the truss to the left of this section as a 
CD statically determinate rigid body. 
The free-body diagram of the portion of the truss to the left. of the section is 
shown. A moment sum about L quickly verifies the assignment of CB as com­
pression, and a moment sum about C quickly discloses that KL is in tension. The 
direction of CL is not quite so obvious until we observe that KL and CB intersect 
at a point P to the right of G. A moment sum about P eliminates reference to KL 
and CB and shows that CL must be compressive to balance the moment of the 
200-k.N force about P. With these considerations in mind the solution becomes 
straightforward, as we now se how to solve for each of the three unknowns in­
dependently of the other two. 
Summing moments about L require 
finding the moment arm BL = 4 + 
® (6.5 - 4)/2 = 5.25 m. Thus, 
200(5)(3) - CB(5.25) = 0

Sample Problem 4/4 
Calculate the force in member DJ of the Howe roof truss illustrated. Ne­
glect any horizontal components of force at the supports. 
Solution. It is not possible to pass a section through DJ without cutting four 
members whose forces are unknown. Although three of these cut by section 2 are 
concurrent at J and therefore the moment equation about J could be used to ob­
tain DE, the force in DJ cannot be obtained from the remaining two equilibrium 
principles. It is necessary to consider first the acljacent section 1 before analyzing 
section 2. 
The free-body diagram for section 1 is drawn and includes the reaction of 
18.33 kN at A, which is previously calculated from the equilibrium of the truss 
as a whole. In assigning the proper directions for the forces acting on the three 
cut members, we see that a balance of moments about A eliminates the effects of 
CD and JK and clearly requires that CJ be up and to the left. A balance of mo­
ments about C eliminates the e.fect of the three forces concurrent at C and indi­
cates that JK must be to the right to supply sufficient counterclockwise moment. 
Again it should be fairly obvious that the lower chord is under tension because of 
the bending tendency of the truss. Although it should also be apparent that the 
top chord is under compression, for purposes of illustration the force in CD will 
(j) be arbitrarily assigned as tension. 
By the analysis of section 1, CJ is obtained from 
0.707CJ(12) - 10(4) - 10(8) = 0 
CJ = 14.14 kN C 
In this equation the moment of CJ is calculated by considering its horizontal and 
vertical components acting at point J. Equilibrium of moments about J requires 
[!.M, = OJ 
0.894CD(6) + 18.33(12) - 10(4) - 10(8) = 0 
CD "' -18.63 kN 
The moment of CD about J is calculated here by considering its two components 
Ci) as acting through D. The minus sign indicates that CD was assigned in the 
wrong direction. 
Hence, 
CD = 18.63 kN C 
From the frre-body diagram of section 2, which now includes the known 
@ value of CJ, a balance of moments about G is seen to eliminate DE and JK. 
Thus, 
[!.Ma = 0] 
12DJ + 10(16) + 10(20) - 18.33(24) - 14.14(0.707)(12) = 0 
DJ = 16.67 kN T 
Ans. 
Again the moment of CJ is determined from its components considered to be act­
ing at J. The answer for DJ is positive, so that the assumed tensile direction is 
correct. 
An alternative approach to the entire problem is to utilize section 1 to deter­
mine CD and then use the method of joints applied at D to determine DJ.

S PACE TRUSSES 
A space trus is the three-dimensional counterpart of the plane 
truss described in the three previous articles. The idealized space truss 
consists of rigid links connected at their ends by ball-and-socket joints 
(such a joint is illustrated in Fig. 3/8 in Art. 3/4). Whereas a triangle of 
pin-connected bars forms the basic noncollapsible unit for the plane 
truss, a space truss, on the other hand, requires six bars joined at their 
ends to form the edges of a tetrahedron as the basic noncollapsible unit. 
In Fig. 4113a the two bars AD and BD joined at D require a third sup­
port CD to keep the triangle ADB from rotating about AB. In Fig. 4/13b 
the supporting base is replaced by three more bars AB, BC, and AC to 
form a tetrahedron not dependent on the foundation for its own rigidity. 
We may form a new rigid unit to extend the structure with three ad­
ditioo.al concurrent bars whose ends are attached to three fixed joints on 
the existing structure. Thus, in Fig. 4113c the bars AF, BF, and CF are 
attached to the foundation and therefore fix point F in space. Likewise, 
point H is fixed in space by the bars Al, DH, and CH. The three addi­
tional bars CG, FG, and HG are attached to the three fixed points C, F, 
and H and therefore fix G in space. The fixed point E is similarly cre­
ated. We see now that the structure is entirely rigid. The two applied 
loads shown will result in forces in all of the members. A space truss 
formed in this way is called a simple space truss. 
Ideally there must be point support, such as that given by a ball­
and-socket joint, at the connections of a space truss to prevent bend­
ing in the members. As in riveted and welded connections for plane 
trusses, if the centerlines of joined members intersect at a point, we 
can justify the assumption of two-force members under simple tension 
and compression. 
Statically Determinate Space Trusses 
When a space truss is supported externally so that it is statically 
determinate as an entire unit, a relationship exists between the num­
ber of its joints and the number of its member necessary for internal 
stability without redundancy. Because the equilibrium of each joint is 
specified by three scalar force equations, there are in all 3j such equa­
tions for a space truss withj joints. For the entire truss composed of m 
members there are m unknowns (the tensile or compressive forces in 
the members) plus six unknown support reactions in the general case 
of a statically determinate space structure. Thus, for any space truss, 
the equation m + 6 = 3j will be satisfied if the truss is statically deter­
minate internally. A simple space truss satisfies this relation automati­
cally. Starting with the initial tetrahedron, for which the equation 
holds, the structure is extended by adding three members and one joint 
at a time, thus preserving the equality. 
As in the case of the plane truss, this relation is a necessary condi­
tion for stability, but it is not a sufficient condition, since one or more 
of the m members can be arranged in such a way as not to contribute 
to a stable configuration of the entire truss. If m + 6 > 3j, there are 
more members than there are independent equations, and the truss is 
statically indeterminate internally with redundant members present.

A space truss is i ncorporated i nto the 
world's longest g l ass skywalk which 
is located in Huangshi National Forest 
Park in Chongqing, C h i na. 
If m + 6 < 3j, there is a deficiency of internal members, and the truss 
is unstable and subject to collapse under load. This relationship be­
tween the number of joints and the number of members is very helpful 
in the preliminary design of a stable space truss, since the configura­
tion is not as obvious as with a plane truss, where the geometry for 
statical determinacy is generally quite apparent. 
Method of Joints for Space Trusses 
The method of joints developed in Art. 4/3 for plane trusses may be 
extended directly to space trusses by satisfYing the complete vector 
equation 
}";F = 0 
{4/1 ) 
for each joint. We normally begin the analysis at a joint where at least one 
known force acts and not more than three unknown forces are present. 
Adjacent joints on which not more than thre unknown forces act may 
then be analyzed in tum. 
This step-by-step joint technique tends to minimize the number of 
simultaneous equations to be solved when we must determine the forces 
in al members of the space truss. For this reason, although it is not 
readily reducro to a routine, such an approach is recommended. As an 
alternative procedure, however, we may simply write 3j joint equations 
by applying Eq. 411 to all joints of the space frame. The number of un­
knowns will be m + 6 if the structure is noncollapsible when removed 
from its supports and those supports provide six external reactions. 
If, in addition, there are no redundant members, then the number of 
equations (3j) equals the number of unknowns (m + 6), and the entire 
system of equations can be solved simultaneously for the unknowns. Be­
cause of the large number of coupled equations, a computer solution is 
usually required. With this latter approach, it is not necessary to begin 
at a joint where at least one known and no more than three unknown 
forces act. 
Method of Sections for Space Trusses 
The method of sections developed in the previous article may also 
be applied to space trusses. The two vector equations 
}"; F = 0 
and 
}";M = O  
must be satisfied for any section of the truss, where the zero moment 
sum will hold for al moment axes. Because the two vector equations are 
equivalent to six scalar equations, we conclude that, in general, a sec­
tion should not be passed through more than six members whose forces 
are unknown. The method of sections for space trusses is not widely 
used, however, because a moment axis can seldom be found which elimi­
nates all but one unknown, as in the case of plane trusses. 
Vector notation for expressing the terms in the force and moment 
equations for space trusses is of considerable advantage and is used in 
the sample problem which follows. 

Sample Problem 4/5 
The space truss consists of the rigid tetrahedron ABCD anchored by a ball­
and-socket connection at A and prevented from any rotation about the x-, y-, or 
z-axes by the respective links 1, 2 ,  and 3. The load L is applied to joint E, which 
is rigidly fixed to the tetrahedron by the three additional links. Solve for the 
forces in the members at joint E and indicate the procedure for the determina­
tion of the forces in the remaining members of the truss. 
Solution. We note first that the truss is supported with six properly placed 
constraints, which are the three at A and the links 1 ,  2, and 3. Also, with m = 9 
members andj = 5 joints, the condition m + 6 = 3j for a sufficiency of members 
to provide a noncollapsible structure is satisfied. 
The external reactions at A, B, and D can be calculated easily as a first step, 
although their values will be determined from the solution of all forces on each 
CD of the joints in succession. 
We start with a joint on which at least one known force and not more than 
three unknown forces act, which in this case is joint E. The free-body diagram of 
joint E is shown with all foree vectors arbitrarily assumed in their positive ten­
® sion directions (away from the joint). The vector expressions for the thre un­
known forces are

Thus, we conclude that FEB and Fgc are compressive forces and FED is tension. 
Unless we have computed the extemal reactions first, we must next analyze 
joint C with the known value of Fgc and the thre unknowns Fe8, FCA, and Fen· 
The procedure is identical to that used for joint E. Joints B, D, and A are then 
analyzed in the same way and in that order, which limits the scalar unknowns to 
thre for each joint. The external reactions computed from these analyses must, 
of course, agree with the values which can be determined initially from an analy­
sis of the truss as a whole.

4 / 6  fRA M ES A N D  M A C HI N ES 
A structure is called a frame or machine if at least one of its individ­
ual members is a multiforce member. A multiforce member is defined as 
one with three or more forces acting on it, or one with two or more 
forces and one or more couples acting on it. Frames are structures 
which are designed to support applied loads and are usually fixed in po­
sition. Machines are structures which contain moving parts and are de­
signed to transmit input forces or couples to output forces or couples. 
Because frames and machines contain multiforce members, the 
forces in these members in general will not be in the directions of the 
members. Therefore, we cannot analyze these structures by the meth­
ods developed in Arts. 4/3, 4/4, and 4/5 because these methods apply to 
simple trusses composed of two-force members where the forces are in 
the directions of the members. 
Interconnected Rigid Bodies with Multiforce Members 
In Chapter 3 we discussed the equilibrium of multiforce bodies, but 
we concentrated on the equilibrium of a single rigid body. In the present 
article we focus on the equilibrium of interconnected rigid bodies which in­
clude multiforce members. Although most such bodies may be analyzed as 
two-dimensional systems, there are numerous examples of frames and 
machines which are three-dimensional. 
The forces acting on each member of a connected system are found 
by isolating the member with a free-body diagram and applying the 
equations of equilibrium. The principle of action and reaction must be 
carefully ob erved when we represent the force 
of interaction on the 
separate free-body diagrams. If the structure contains more members or 
supports than are necessary to prevent collapse, then, as in the case of 
trusses, the problem is statically indeterminate, and the principles of 
equilibrium, though necessary, are not sufficient for solution. Although 
many frames and machines are statically indeterminate, in this article 
we will consider only those which are statically determinate. 
If the frame or machine constitutes a rigid unit by itself when re­
moved from its supports, like the A-frame in Fig. 4/14a, the analysis is 
best begun by establishing all the forces external to the structure 
treated as a single rigid body. We then dismember the structure and 
consider the equilibrium of each part separately. The equilibrium equa­
tions for the several parts will be related through the terms involving

the forces of interaction. If the structure is not a rigid unit by itself but 
depends on its external supports for rigidity, as illustrated in Fig. 4114b, 
then the calculation of the external support reactions cannot be com­
pleted until the structure is dismembered and the individual parts are 
analyzed. 
Force Representation and Free-Body Diagrams 
In most cases the analysis of frames and machines is facilitated by 
representing the forces in terms of their rectangular components. This 
is particularly so when the dimensions of the parts are given in mutu­
ally perpendicular directions. The advantage of this representation is 
that the calculat" on of moment arms is simplified. In some three­
dimensional problems, particularly when moments are evaluated about 
axes which are not parallel to the coordinate axes, use of vector notation 
is advantageous. 
It is not always possible to assign the proper sense to every force or 
its components when drawing the free-body diagrams, and it becomes 
necessary to make an arbitrary assignment. In any event, it is absolutely 
necessary that a force be consistently represented on the diagrams for in­
teracting bodies which involve the force in question. Thus, for two bod­
ies connected by the pin A, Fig. 4/15a, the force components must be 
consistently represented in opposite directions on the separate free-body 
diagrams. 
For a ball-and-socket connection between members of a space 
frame, we must apply the action-and-reaction principle to all three com­
ponents as shown in Fig. 4/15b. The a signed directions may prove to be 
wrong when the algebraic signs of the components are determined upon 
calculation. If Ax, for instance, should turn out to be negative, it is actu­
ally acting in the direction opposite to that originally represented. Ac­
cordingly, we would need to reverse the direction of the force on both 
members and to reverse the sign of its force terms in the equations. Or 
we may leave the representation as originally made, and the proper 
sense of the force will be understood from the negative sign. If we 
choose to use vector notation in labeling the forces, then we must be 
careful to use a plus sign for an action and a minus sign for the corre­
sponding reaction, as shown in Fig. 4116. 
We may occasionally need to solve two or more equations simulta­
neously in order to separate the unknowns. In most instances, however, 
we can avoid simultaneous solutions by careful choice of the member or 
group of members for the free-body diagram and by a careful choice of 
moment axes which will eliminate undesired terms from the equations. 
The method of solution described in the foregoing paragraphs is illus­
trated in the following sample problems.

Sample Problem 4/6 
The frame supports the 400-kg load in the maner shown. Neglect the 
weights of the members compared with the forces induced by the load and com­
pute the horizontal and vertical components of all forces acting on each of the 
members. 
Solution. We observe first that the three supporting members which consti­
CD tute the frame form a ri&ti.d assembly that can be analyzed as a single unit. We 
also observe that the arrangement of the extemal supports makes the frame stat­
ically determinate. 
From the free-body diagram of the entire frame we determine the external 
reactions. Thus, 
[kMA = 0] 
(kF% = 0] 
(kFy= O] 
5.5(0.4)(9.81) - 5D 
= 0 
A,. - 4.32 = 0 
Ay - 3.92 = 0 
D = 4.32 kN 
A.,= 4.32 kN 
Ay = 3.92 kN 
Next we dismember the frame and draw a separate fre-body diagram of 
each member. The diagrams are arranged in their approximate relative positions 
to aid in keeping track of the common forces of interaction. The external reac­
tions just obtained are entered onto the diagram for AD . Other known forces are 
the 3.92-kN forces exerted by the shaft of the pulley on the member BF, as ob­
tained from the fr"O-body diagram of the pulley. The cable tension of 3.92 kN is 
also shown acting on AD at its attachment point. 
Next, the components of all unknown forces are shown on the diagrams. 
® Here we observe that CE is a two-force member. The force components on CE 
have equal and opposite reactions, which are shown on BF at E and on AD at C. 
We may not recognize the actual sense of the components at B at first glance, so 
they may be arbitrarily but consistently as igned. 
The solution may proceed by use of a moment equation about B or E for 
member BF, followed by the two force equations. Thus, 
[kMn = 0) 
3.92(5) - &E.,(3) = 0 
E.,= 13.08 kN 
Ans. 
(kFy= O) 
B1 + 3.92 - 13.08/2 = 0

Ans. 
(kF% = 0] 
B,. + 3.92 - 13.08 = 0 
B.,= 9.15 kN 
Ans. 
Positive numerical values of the unknowns mean that we assumed their direc­
tions correctly on the free-body diagrams. The value of C., = E., = 13.08 kN ob­
tained by inspection of the free-body diagram of CE is now entered onto the 
diagram for AD, along with the values of B,. and B,. just determined. The equa­
tions of equilibrium may now be applied to member AD as a check, since all the 
forces acting on it have already been computed. The equations give 
[kMc = 0]

[kFy= O) 
4.32(3.5) + 4.32( 1.5) - 3.92(2) - 9.15(1 .5) = 0 
4.32 - 13.08 + 9.15 + 3.92 + 4.32 = 0

Sample Problem 4/8 
The machine shown is desir,'led as an overload protection device which re­
leases the load when it exceeds a predetermined value T. A soft metal shear pin 
S is inserted in a hole in the lower half and is acted on by the upper half. When 
the total force on the pin exceeds its strength, it will break. The two halves then 
rotate about A under the action of the tensions in BD and CD, as shown in the 
second sketch, and rollers E and F release the eye bolt. Determine the maximum 
allowable tension T if the pin S will shear when the total force on it is 800 N. 
Also compute the corresponding for-ce on the hinge pin A. 
Solution. Because of symmetry, we analyze only one of the two hinged mem­
bers. The upper part is chosen, and its free-body diagram along with that for the 
connection at D is drawn. Because of symmetry the forces at S and A have no 
CD x-components. The two-force members BD and CD exert forces of equal magni­
tude B = C on the connection at D. Equilibrium of the connection gives

C H A PTER R E V I EW 
In Chapter 4 we have applied the principles of equilibrium to two classes 
of problems: (a) simple trusses and (b) frames and machines. No new theory 
was needed, since we merely drew the necessary free-body diagrams and 
applied our familiar equations of equilibrium. The structures dealt with in 
Chapter 4, however, have given us the opportunity to further develop our 
appreciation for a systematic approach to mechanics problems. 
The most essential features of the analysis of these two classes of 
structures are reviewed in the following statements. 
(a) Simple Trusses 
1. Simple trusses are composed of two-force members joined at their ends 
and capable of supporting tension or compression. Each internal force, 
therefore, is always in the direction of the line joining the endpoints of its 
member. 
2. Simple trusses are built from the basic rigid (noncollapsible) unit of 
the triangle for plane trusses and the tetrahedron for space trusses. 
Additional units of a truss are formed by adding new members, two for 
plane trusses and three for space trusses, attached to existing joints and 
joined at their ends to form a new joint. 
3. The joints of simple trusses are assumed to be pin connections for plane 
trusses and ball-and-socket connections for space trusses. Thus, the joints 
can transmit force but not moment. 
4. External loads are assumed to be applied only at the joints. 
5. Trusses 
are 
statically 
determinate 
externally 
when 
the 
external 
constraints are not in excess of those required to maintain an equilibrium 
position. 
6. Trusses are statically determinate internally when constructed in the 
manner described in item (2), where internal members are not in excess 
of those required to prevent collapse. 
7. The method of joints utilizes the force equations of equilibrium for each 
joint. Analysis normally begins at a joint where at least one force is known 
and not more than two forces are unknown for plane trusses or not more 
than three forces are unknown for space trusses. 
8. The method of sections utilizes a free body of an entire section of a 
truss containing two or more joints. In general, the method involves the 
equilibrium of a nonconcurrent system of forces. The moment equation 
of equilibrium is especially useful when the method of sections is used. 
In general, the forces acting on a section which cuts more than three 
unknown members of a plane truss cannot be solved for completely 
because there are only three independent equations of equilibrium. 
9. The vector representing a force acting on a joint or a section is drawn 
on the same side of the joint or section as the member which transmits 
the force. With this convention, tension is indicated when the force arrow 
is away from the joint or section, and compression is indicated when the 
arrow points toward the joint or section. 

Art i c l e  4/7 
C h a pter R e v i ew 221 
10. When the two diagonal members which brace a quadrilateral panel are 
flexible members incapable of supporting compression, only the one 
in tension is retained in the analysis, and the panel remains statically 
determinate. 
1 1. When two joined members under load are collinear and a third member 
with a different direction is joined with their connection, the force in the 
third member must be zero unless an external force is applied at the joint 
with a component normal to the collinear members. 
(b) Frames and Machines 
1. Frames and 
machines 
are 
structures 
which 
contain 
one or 
more 
multiforce members. A multiforce member is one which has acting on it 
three or more forces, or two or more forces and one or more couples. 
2. Frames are structures designed to support loads, generally under static 
conditions. Machines are structures which transform input forces and 
moments to output forces and moments and generally involve moving 
parts. Some structures may be classified as either a frame or a machine. 
3. Only frames and machines which are statically determinate externally 
and internally are considered here. 
4. If a frame or machine as a whole is a rigid (noncollapsible) unit when its 
external supports are removed, then we begin the analysis by computing 
the external reactions on the entire unit. If a frame or machine as a whole 
is a nonrigid (collapsible) unit when its external supports are removed, 
then the analysis of the external reactions cannot be completed until the 
structure is dismembered. 
5. Forces acting in the internal connections of frames and machines are 
calculated by dismembering the structure and constructing a separate 
free-body diagram of each part. The principle of action and reaction must 
be strictly observed; otherwise, error will result. 
6. The force and moment equations of equilibrium are applied to the 
members as needed to compute the desired unknowns.

INTRODUCTION 
In the previous chapters we treated all forces as concentrated along 
their lines of action and at their points of application. This treatment 
provided a reasonable model for those forces. Actually, "concentrated" 
forces do not exist in the exact sense, since every external force applied 
mechanically to a body is distributed over a finite contact area, however 
small. 
The force exerted by the pavement on an automobile tire, for in­
stance, is applied to the tire over its entire area of contact, Fig. 5/la, 
which may be appreciable if the tire is soft. When analyzing the forces 
acting on the car as a whole, if the dimension b of the contact area is 
negligible compared with the other pertinent dimensions, such as the 
distance between wheels, then we may replace the actual distributed 
contact forces by their resultant R treated as a concentrated force. Even 
the force of contact between a hardened steel ball and its race in a 
loaded ball bearing, Fig. 5/lb, is applied over a finite, though extremely 
small, contact area. The forces applied to a two-force member of a truss, 
Fig. 5/lc, are applied over an actual area of contact of the pin against

the hole and internally across the cut section as shown. In these and 
other similar examples, we may treat the forces as concentrated when 
analyzing their external effects on bodies as a whole. 
If, on the other hand, we want to find the distribution of internal 
forces in the material of the body near the contact location, where the 
internal stresses and strains may be appreciable, then we must not treat 
the load as concentrated but must consider the actual distribution. This 
problem will not be discussed here because it requires knowledge of the 
properties of the material and belongs in more advanced treatments of 
the mechanics of materials and the theories of elasticity and plasticity. 
When forces are applied over a region whose dimensions are not 
negligible compared with other pertinent dimensions, then we must ac­
count for the actual manner in which the force is distributed. We do this by 
suming the effects of the distributed force over the entire region using 
mathematical integration. This requires that we know the intensity of 
the force at any location. There are thre categories of such problems. 
(1) Line Distribution. When a force is distributed along a line, as in 
the continuous vertical load supported by a suspended cable, Fig. 5/2a, 
the intensity w of the loading is expressed as force per unit length of 
line, newtons per meter (N/m) or pounds per foot (lb/ft). 
(2) Area Distribution. When a force is distributed over an area, as 
with the hy draulic pressure of water against the inner face of a section 
of dam, Fig. 512b, the intensity is expressed as force per unit area. This 
intensity is called pressure for the action of fluid forces and stress for the 
internal distribution of forces in solids. The basic unit for pressure or 
stress in SI is the newton per square meter (N/m2), which is also called 
the pascal (Pa). This unit, however, is too small for most applications 
(6895 Pa = llb/in.2). The kilopascal (kPa), which equals 103 Pa, is more 
commonly used for fluid pressure, and the megapascal, which equals 
106 Pa, is used for stress. In the U.S. customary system of units, both fluid 
pressure and mechanical stress are commonly expressed in pounds per 
square inch (lbfm. 2). 
(3) Volume Distribution. A force which is distributed over the vol­
ume of a body is called a body force. The most common body force is the 
force of gravitational attraction, which acts on all elements of mass in a 
body. The determination of the forces on the supports of the heavy can­
tilevered structure in Fig. 5/2c, for example, would require accounting 
for the distribution of gravitational force throughout the structure. The 
intensity of gravitational force is the specific weight pg, where pis the 
density (mass per unit volume) and g is the acceleration due to gravity. 
The units for pg are (kg/m3)(m!s2) = N/m3 in SI units and lb/ft3 or lb/in.3 
in the U.S. customary sy stem. 
The body force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth 
(weight) is by far the most commonly encountered distributed force. 
Section A of this chapter treats the determination of the point in a body 
through which the resultant gravitational force acts, and discusses the 
associated geometric properties of lines, areas, and volumes. Section B 
treats distributed forces which act on and in beams and flexible cables 
and distributed forces which fluids exert on exposed surfaces.

CENTER OF MASS 
Consider a three-dimensional body of any size and shape, having 
a mass m. If we suspend the body, as shown in Fig. 5/3, from any 
point such as A, the body will be in equilibrium under the action of 
the tension in the cord and the resultant W of the gravitational forces 
acting on all particles of the body. This resultant is clearly collinear 
with the cord. Assume that we mark its position by drilling a hy po­
thetical hole of negligible size along its line of action. We repeat the 
experiment by suspending the body from other points such as B and 
C, and in each instance we mark the line of action of the resultant 
force. For all practical purposes these lines of action will be concur­
rent at a single point G, which is called the center of gravity of the 
body. 
An exact analy sis, however, would account for the slightly differing 
directions of the gravity forces for the various particles of the body, be­
cause those forces converge toward the center of attraction of the earth. 
Also, because the particles are at different distances from the earth, the 
intensity of the force field of the earth is not exactly constant over the 
body. As a result, the lines of action of the gravity-force resultants in 
the experiments just described will not be quite concurrent, and there­
fore no unique center of gravity exists in the exact sense. This is of no 
practical importance as long as we deal with bodies whose dimensions 
are small compared with those of the earth. We therefore assume a uni­
form and parallel force field due to the gravitational attraction of the 
earth. This assumption results in the concept of a unique center of 
gravity. 
Determining the Center of Gravity 
To determine mathematically the location of the center of gravity of 
any body, Fig. 5/4a, we apply the principle of moments (see Art. 216) to 
the parallel system of gravitational forces. The moment of the resultant 
gravitational force W about any axis equals the sum of the moments

about the same axis of the gravitational forces dW acting on all particles 
treated as infinitesimal elements of the body. The resultant of the gravi­
tational forces acting on all elements is the weight of the body and is 
given by th.e sum W = f dW. If we apply the moment principle about the 
y-axis, for example, the moment about this axis of the elemental weight 
is x dW, and the sum of these moments for al elements of the body is 
f x dW. This sum of moments must equal W x, the moment of the sum. 
Thus, .XW = f x dW. 
With similar expressions for the other two components, we may ex­
press the coordinates of the center of gravity G as 
- I ydW 
y

{5/la) 
To visualize the physical moments of the gravity forces appearing in the 
third equation, we may reorient the body and attached axes so that the 
z-axis is horizontal. It is essential to recognize that the numerator of 
each of these expressions represents the sum of the moments, whereas 
the product of W and the corresponding coordinate of G represents the 
moment of the sum. This moment principle finds repeated use throughout 
mechanics. 
With the substitution of W = mg and dW = g dm, the expressions 
for the coordinates of the center of gravity become

{5/lb) 
Equations 5/lb may be expressed in vector form with the aid of 
Fig. 514b, in which the elemental mass and the mass center G are located 

by their respective position vectors r = xi + yj + zk and r = .Xi + yj + Zk. 
Thus, Eqs. 5/lb are the components of the single vector equation 
{5/2) 
The density p of a body is its mass per unit volume. Thus, the mass 
of a differential element of volume dV becomes dm = p dV. If p is not 
constant throughout the body but can be expressed as a function of the 
coordinates of the body, we must account for this variation when calcu­
lating the numerators and denominators of Eqs. 5/lb. We may then 
write these expressions as 
_ I xp dV 
x = f p dV 
- I yp dV 
y = I p dV 
_ J zp dV 
z = f p dV 
(513) 
Center of Mass versus Center of Gravity 
Equations 5/lb, 5/2, and 5/3 are independent of gravitational effects 
since g no longer appears. They therefore define a unique point in the 
body which is a function solely of the distribution of mass. This point is 
called the center of mass, and clearly it coincides with the center of grav­
ity as long as the gravity field is treated as uniform and parallel. 
It is meaningless to speak of the center of gravity of a body which is 
removed from the gravitational field of the earth, since no gravitational 
forces would act on it. The body would, however, still have its unique 
center of mass. We will usually refer henceforth to the center of mass 
rather than to the center of gravity. Also, the center of mass has a spe­
cial significance in calculating the dynamic response of a body to unbal­
anced forces. This class of problems is discussed at length in Vol. 2 
Dynamics. 
In most problems the calculation of the position of the center of 
mass may be simplified by an intelligent choice of reference axes. In gen­
eral, the axes should be placed so as to simplify the equations of the 
boundaries as much as possible. Thus, polar coordinates wil be useful 
for bodies with circular boundaries. 
Another important clue may be taken from considerations of sym­
metry. Whenever there exists a line or plane of symmetry in a homoge­
neous body, a cordinate axis or plane should be chosen to coincide with 
this line or plane. The center of mass will always lie on such a line or 
plane, since the moments due to symmetrically located elements will al­
ways cancel, and the body may be considered to be composed of pairs of 
these elements. Thus, the center of mass G of the homogeneous right­
circular cone of Fig. 5/5a will lie somewhere on its central axis, which is 
a line of symmetry. The center of mass of the half right-circular cone lies 
on its plane of symmetry, Fig. 5/5b. The center of mass of the half ring in 
Fig. 5/5c lies in both of its planes of symmetry and therefore is situated

When the density p of a body is uniform throughout, it will be a 
constant factor in both the numerators and denominators of Eqs. 5/3 
and wil therefore cancel. The remaining expressions define a purely 
geometrical property of the body, since any reference to its mass prop­
erties has disappeared. The term centroid is used when the calculation 
concerns a geometrical shape only. When speaking of an actual physical 
body, we use the term center of mass. If the density is uniform throughout 
the body, the positions of the centroid and center of mass are identical, 
whereas if the density varies, these two points will, in general, not 
coincide. 
The calculation of centroids falls within three distinct categories, 
depending on whether we can model the shape of the body involved as 
a line, an area, or a volume. 
(1) Lines. For a slender rod or wire of length L, cross-sectional area 
A, and density p, Fig. 5/6, the body approximates a line segment, and 
dm = pA dL. If p and A are constant over the length of the rod, the cor­
dinates of the center of mass also become the coordinates of the centroid 
C of the line segment, which, from Eqs. 5/lb, may be written 
- I ydL 
y=
--
L 
(514) 
Note that, in general, the centroid C will not lie on the line. If the rod 
lies on a single plane, such as the x-y plane, only two coordinates need to 
be calculated. 
(2) Areas. When a body of density p has a small but constant thick­
ness t, we can model it as a surface area A, Fig. 517. The mass of an ele­
ment becomes dm = pt dA. Again, if p and t are constant over the entire 
area, the coordinates of the center of mass of the body also become the 
coordinates of the centroid C of the surface area, and from Eqs. 5/lb the 
coordinates may be written 
- I ydA 
y=
--
A 
(515) 
The numerators in Eqs. 5/5 are called the first moments of area.* If the 
surface is curved, as illustrated in Fig. 517 with the shell segment, all 
three coordinates will be involved. The centroid C for the curved sur­
face will in general not lie on the surface. If the area is a flat surface in, 
*Second moments of areas (moments of first moments) appear later in our discussion of 
area moments of inertia in Appendix A.

say, the x-y plane, only the coordinates of C in that plane need to be 
calculated. 
(3) Volumes. For a general body of volume V and density p, the ele­
ment has a mass dm = p dV. The density p cancels if it is constant over 
the entire volume, and the coordinates of the center of mass also become 
the coordinates of the centroid C of the body. From Eqs. 5/3 or 5/lb they 
become

CHOI C E  OF ELE M ENT FOR INTEGRATION 
(516) 
The principal dificulty with a theory often lies not in its concepts 
but in the procedures for applying it. With mass centers and centroids 
the concept of the moment principle is simple enough; the difficult steps 
are the choice of the differential element and setting up the integrals. 
The following five guidelines will be useful. 
(1) Order of Element. Whenever possible, a first.order differential 
element should be selected in preference to a higher-order element so 
that only one integration will be required to cover the entire figure. 
Thus, in Fig. 5/Ba a first-order horizontal strip of area dA = l dy will re­
quire only one integration with respect to y to cover the entire figure. 
The second-order element dx dy will require two integrations, first with 
respect to x and second with respect toy, to cover the figure. As a further 
example, for the solid cone in Fig. 518b we choose a first-order element in 
the form of a circular slice of volume dV = ǋ dy. This choice requires 
only one integration, and thus is preferable to choosing a third-order ele­
ment dV = dx dy dz, which would require three awkward integrations. 
(2) Continuity. Whenever possible, we choose an element which can 
be integrated in one continuous operation to cover the figure. Thus, the 
horizontal strip in Fi.g. 5/& would be preferable to the vertical strip in 
Fig. 519, which, if used, would require two separate integrals because of 
the discontinuity in the expression for the height of the strip at x = x1• 
(3) Discarding Higher-Order Terms. Higher-order terms may al­
ways be dropped compared with lower-order terms (see Art. 117). Thus, 
the vertical strip of area under the curve in Fig. 5/10 is given by the 
F igure 5/9

F igu re 5/11 
first-order term dA = y dx, and the second-order triangular area w dx dy 
is discarded. In the limit, of course, there is no error. 
(4) Choice of Coordinates. As a general rule, we choose the coordi­
nate system which best matches the boundaries of the figure. Thus, the 
boundaries of the area in Fig. 5/lla are most easily described in rectan­
gular coordinates, whereas the boundaries of the circular sector of 
Fig. 5/llb are best suited to polar coordinates. 
(5) Centroidal Coordinate of Element. When a first- or second-order 
differential element is chosen, it is essential to use the cordinate of the 
centroid of the element for the moment arm in expressing the moment of 
the differential element. Thus, for the horizontal strip of area in Fig. 5/12a, 
the moment of dA about they-axis is Xc dA, where xc is the x-coordinate 
of the centroid C of the element. Note that Xc is not the x which de­
scribes either boundary of the area. In the y-direction for this element 
the moment arm Yc of the centroid of the element is the same, in the 
limit, as they-coordinates of the two boundaries. 
As a second example, consider the solid half-cone of Fig. 5/12b with 
the semicircular slice of differential thickness as the element of vol­
ume. The moment arm for the element in the x-direction is the distance 
Xc to the centroid of the face of the element and not the x-distance to the 
boundary of the element. On the other hand, in the z-direction the mo­
ment arm zc of the centroid of the element is the same as the z-coordinate 
of the element. 
With these examples in mind, we rewrite Eqs. 5/5 and 5/6 in the form

It is essential to recognize that the subscript c serves as a reminder that 
the moment arms appearing in the numerators of the integral expres­
sions for moments are always the coordinates of the centroids of the 
particular elements chosen. 
At this point you should be certain to understand clearly the princi­
ple of moments, which was introduced in Art. Z/4. You should recognize 
the physical meaning of this principle as it is applied to the system of 
parallel weight forces depicted in Fig. 5/4a. Keep in mind the equiva­
lence between the moment of the resultant weight W and the sum (inte­
gral) of the moments of the elemental weights dW, to avoid mistakes in 
setting up the necessary mathematics. Recognition of the principle of 
moments will help in obtaining the correct expression for the moment 
arm X0, y,, or z, of the centroid of the chosen differential element. 
Keeping in mind the physical picture of the principle of moments, 
we wil recognize that Eqs. 5/4, 5/5, and 5/6, which are geometric rela­
tionships, are descriptive also of homogeneous physical bodies, because 
the density p cancels. If the density of the body in question is not con­
stant but varies throughout the body as some function of the coordi­
nates, then it will not cancel from the numerator and denominator of 
the mass-center expressions. In this event, we must use Eqs. 5/3 as ex­
plained earlier. 
Sample Problems 5/1 through 5/5 which follow have been carefully 
chosen to illustrate the application of Eqs. 5/4, 5/5, and 5/6 for calculat­
ing the location of the centroid for line segments (slender rods), areas 
(thin flat plates), and volumes (homogeneous solids). The five integra­
tion considerations listed above are illustrated in detail in these sample 
problems. 
Section C/10 of Appendix C contains a table of integrals which in­
cludes those needed for the problems in this and subsequent chapters. A 
summary of the centroidal coordinates for some of the commonly used 
shapes is given in Tables D/3 and D/4, Appendix D.

Sample Problem 5/1 
Centroid of a circular arc. Locate the centroid of a circular arc as shown in 
the figure. 
Solution. Choosing the axis of symmetry as the x-axis makes y .. 0. A differ­
ential element of arc has the length dL - r dJ expressed in polar coordinates, 
CD and the x-coordinate of the element is r cos 8. 
Applying the first ofE qs. 5/4 and substituting L = 2ar give

Ans. 
For a semicircular arc 2a = 'T, which gives x = 2ri'T. By symmetry we see 
immediately that this result also applies to the quarter-circular arc when the 
measurement is made as shown. 
Helpful Hint 
CD It should be perfectly evident that polar coordinates are preferable to rectan­
gular coordinates to express the length of a circular arc. 
Sample Problem 5/2 
Centroid of a triangular ares. Determine the distance h from the base of a 
triangle of altitude h to the centroid of its area. 
Solution. The x·axis is taken to coincide with the base. A differential strip of 
CD area dA = x dy is chosen. By similar triangles x/(h - y) = blh. Applying the 
second of Eqs. 5/5a gives

This same result holds with respect to either of the other two sides of the 
triangle considered a new base with corresponding new altitude. Thus, the cen­
troid lies at the intersection of the medians, since the distance of this point from 
any side is one-third the altitude of the triangle with that side considered the 
base.

Sample Problem 5/3 
Centroid of the area of a circular sector. Locate the centroid of the area 
of a circular sector with respect to its vertex. 
Solution I. The x-axis is chosen as the axis of symmetry, and y is therefore au­
tomatically zero. We may cover the area by moving an element in the form of 
a partial circular ring, as shown in the figure, from the center to the outer pe­
riphery. The radius of the ring is r0 and its thickness is dr0, so that its area is 
CD dA = 2roa dr0. 
The x-coordinate to the centroid of the element from Sample Problem 5/1 is 
® xc = r0 sin ala, where r0 replaces r in the formula. Thus, the first of Eqs. 5/5a 
gives 
rax = 2r3 sin a

Solution II. The area may also be covered by swinging a triangle of differen­
tial area about the vertex and through the total angle of the sector. This triangle, 
shown in the illustration, has an area dA = {r/2)(r dfJ), where higher-order terms 
are neglected. From Sample Problem 5/2 the centroid of the triangular element 
of area is two-thirds of its altitude from its vertex, so that the x-cordinate to the 
centroid of the element is x, = r cos 0. Applying the first ofEqs. 515a gives

For a semicircular area 2a = 'T', which gives x = 4ri31T. By symmetry we see

It should be noted that, if we had chosen a second-order element r0 dr0 dO, 
one integration with respect to (J would yield the ring with which Solutwn 1 
began. On the other hand, integration with respect to r0 initially would give the 
triangular element with which Solution II began.

Locate the centroid of the area under the curve x = ky3 from x = 0 to x = a.

In the solution for y from the second of Eqs. 5/5a, the coordinate to the

employed in place of the vertical element. The x-coordinate to the centroid of the 
rectangular element is sen to be x0 = x + (a - x) 
= (a + x)/2, which is simply 
the average of the coordinates a and x of the ends of the strip. Hence,

the previous results for x andy.

Hemispherical volume. Locate the centroid of the volume of a hemisphere of 
radius r with respect to its base. 
Solution I. With the axes chosen as shown in the figure, i "" z "" 0 by symme­
try. The most convenient element is a circular slice of thickness dy parallel to 
the x.z plane. Since the hemisphere intersects the y-z plane in the circle y2 + z2 =

slice becomes

Solution II. Alternatively we may use for our differential element a cylindrical 
shell of length y, radius z, and thickness dz, as shown in the lower figure. By ex­
panding the radius of the shell from zero to r, we cover the entire volume. By 
symmetry the centroid of the elemental shell lies at its center, so that y, = y/2. 
The volume of the element is dV = (21TZ dz)(y). Expressing y in terms of z from 
the equation of the circle givesy = +Jr- r. Using the value ofƈ computed 
in Solution I for the volume of the hemisphere and substituting in the second of 
Eqs. 516a give us

Solutions I and II are of comparable use since each involves an element of 
simple shape and requires integration with respect to one variable only. 
Solution Il. As an alternative, we could use the angle 8 as our variable with 
limits of 0 and 7T/2. The radius of either element would become r sin 8, whereas 
the thickness of the slice in Solution I would be dy = (r dO) sin 8 and that of the 
shell in Solution II would be dz = (r d8) cos 9. The length of the shell would be 
y =r coso.

When a body or figure can be conveniently divided into several parts 
whose mass centers are easily determined, we use the principle of mo­
ments and treat each part as a finite element of the whole. Such a body is 
illustrated schematically in Fig. 5/13. Its parts have masses mt. "'-2, m3 
with the respective mass-center coordinates i1, i2, i3 in the x-direction. 
The moment principle gives 
where X is the x-coordinate of the center of mass of the whole. Similar 
relations hold for the other two coordinate directions. 
We generalize, then, for a body of any number of parts and express 
the sums in condensed form to obtain the mass-center coordinates

Analogous relations hold for composite lines, areas, and volumes, where 
the m's are replaced by L's, A's, and V's, respectively. Note that if a hole 
or cavity is considered one of the component parts of a composite body 
or figure, the corresponding mass represented by the cavity or hole is 
treated as a negative quantity. 
An Approximation Method 
In practice, the boundaries of an area or volume might not be ex­
pressible in terms of simple geometrical shapes or as shapes which can be 
represented mathematically. For such cases we must resort to a method 
of approximation. As an example, consider the problem of locating the 
Figure 5/13 

Arti c l e  5/4 C o mp o site Bod i e s  a n d  F i g u res; App rox i mations 251 
centroid C of the irregular area shown in Fig. 5/14. The area is divided 
into strips of width llx and variable height h. The area A of each strip, 
such as the one shown in red, is h Î and is multiplied by the coordi­
nates Xc and Yc of its centroid to obtain the moments of the element of 
area. The sum of the moments for al strips divided by the total area of 
the strips will give the corresponding centroidal coordinate. A system­
atic tabulation of the results will permit an orderly evaluation of the 
total area -A, the sums -Axe and -Aye, and the centroidal coordinates 
-
-AYe 
y =
--
˦ 
We can increase the accuracy of the approximation by decreasing 
the widths of the strips. In all cases the average height of the strip 
should be estimated in approximating the areas. Although it is usually 
advantageous to use elements of constant width, it is not necessary. In 
fact, we may use elements of any size and shape which approximate the 
given area to satisfactory accuracy. 
Irregular Volumes 
To locate the centroid of an irregular volume, we may reduce the 
problem to one of locating the centroid of an area. Consider the volume 
shown in Fig. 5115, where the magnitudes A of the cross-sectional areas 
normal to the x-direction are plotted against x as shown. A vertical strip 
of area under the curve is A llx, which equals the corresponding element 
of volume ˥ V. Thus, the area under the plotted curve represents the vol­
ume of the body, and the x-cordinate of the centroid of the area under 
the curve is given by 
which equals

Sample Problem 5/8 
Locate the center of mass of the bracket-and-shaft combination. The verti­
cal face is made from sheet metal which has a mass of 25 kg/m2• The material of 
the hori:wntal base has a mass of 40 kglm2, and the steel shaft has a density of 
7.83Mg/m3• 
Solution. The composite body may be considered to be composed of the five ele­
ments shown in the lower portion of the illustration. The triangular part will be 
taken as a negative mass. For the reference axes indicated, it is clear by symme­
try that the x-cordinate of the center of mass is zero. 
The mass m of each part is easily calculated and should need no further ex­
planation. For Part 1 we have from Sample Problem 513

axes becomes

A rt ic l e  5/5 Theorems of Papp u s  261 
5 / 5  T H E O R E M S  OF PAP PUS * 
A very simple method exists for calculating the surface area gener­
ated by revolving a plane curve about a nonintersecting axis in the plane 
of the curve. In Fig. 5/16 the line segment of length L in the x-y plane 
generates a surface when revolved about the x-axis. An element of this 
surface is the ring generated by dL. The area of this ring is its circum­
ference times its slant height or dA = 2ey dL. The total area is then 
A =  27T f y dL 
Because yL = J y dL, the area becomes 
(518) 
where y is the y-coordinate of the centroid C for the line of length L. 
Thus, the generated area is the same as the lateral area of a right-circular 
cylinder of length L and radius y. 
In the case of a volume generated by revolving an area about a 
nonintersecting line in its plane, an equally simple relation exists for 
finding the volume. An element of the volume generated by revolving the 
area A about the x-axis, Fig. 5/17, is the elemental ring of cross section 
dA and radius y. The volume of the element is its circumference times 
dA or dV = 2ey dA, and the total volume is 
v = 27T f y d.A  
Figure 5/17 
*Attributed to Pappus of Alexandria, a Greek geometer who lived in the third century A.D. 
The theorems often bear the name of Guldinus (Paul Guldin, 1577-1643), who claimed 
original authorship, although the works of Pappus were apparently known to him. 
Figure 511 6 

262 Chapte r  5 D i st ributed Fo rces 
Because yA = fy dA, the volume becomes 
(519) 
where y is the y-coordinate of the centroid C of the revolved area A. 
Thus, we obtain the generated volume by multiplying the generating 
area by the circumference of the circular path described by its centroid. 
The two theorems of Pappus, expressed by Eqs. 5/8 and 5/9, are use­
ful for determining areas and volumes of revolution. They are also used 
to find the centroids of plane curves and plane areas when we know the 
corresponding areas and volumes created by revolving these figures 
about a nonintersecting axis. Dividing the area or volume by 27T times 
the corresponding line segment length or plane area gives the distance 
from the centroid to the axis. 
If a line or an area is revolved through an angle 0 less than 21r, we 
can determine the generated surface or volume by replacing 21T by 8 in 
Eqs. 5/8 and 5/9. Thus, the more general relations are 
(5/Sa) 
and 
(519a) 
where 8 is expressed in radians.

SECTION B SPECIAL TOPICS 
5 / 6  B EA M S - EXTE R N A L  E FFECTS 
Beams are structural members which offer resistance to bending 
due to applied loads. Most beams are long prismatic bars, and the loads 
are usually applied normal to the axes of the bars. 
Beams are undoubtedly the most important of all structural mem­
bers, so it is important to understand the basic theory underlying 
their design. To analyze the load-carrying capacities of a beam, we 
must first establish the equilibrium requirements of the beam as a 
whole and any portion of it considered separately. Second, we must es­
tablish the relations between the resulting forces and the accompany­
ing internal resistance of the beam to support these forces. The first 
part of this analysis requires the application of the principles of stat­
ics. The second part involves the strength characteristics of the mater­
ial and is usually treated in studies of the mechanics of solids or the 
mechanics of materials. 
This article is concerned with the external loading and reactions act­
ing on a beam. In Art. 5n we calculate the distribution along the beam 
of the internal force and moment. 
Types of Beams 
Beams supported so that their external support reactions can be cal­
culated by the methods of statics alone are called statically determinate 
beams. A beam which has more supports than needed to provide equilib­
rium is statically indeterminate. To determine the support reactions for 
such a beam we must consider its load-deformation properties in addi­
tion to the equations of static equilibrium. Figure 5/18 shows examples

Figure 5121 
of both types of beams. In this article we will analyze statically determi­
nate beams only. 
Beams may also be identified by the type of external loading they 
support. The beams in Fig. 5/18 are supporting concentrated loads, 
whereas the beam in Fig. 5/19 is supporting a distributed load. The in­
tensity w of a distributed load may be expressed as force per unit length 
of beam. The intensity may be constant or variable, continuous or dis­
continuous. The intensity of the loading in Fig. 5119 is constant from C 
to D and variable from A to C and from D to B. The intensity is discon­
tinuous at D, where it changes magnitude abruptly. Although the inten­
sity itself is not discontinuous at C, the rate of change of intensity dwldx 
is discontinuous. 
Distributed Loads 
Loading intensities which are constant or which vary linearly are 
easily handled. Figure 5/20 illustrates the three most common cases and 
the resultants of the distributed loads in each case. 
In cases a and b of Fig. 5/20, we see that the resultant load R is rep­
resented by the area formed by the intensity w (force per unit length of 
beam) and the length L over which the force is distributed. The resul­
tant passes through the centroid of this area. 
In part c of Fig. 5/20, the trapezoidal area is broken into a rectangu­
lar and a triangular area, and the corresponding resultants R1 and R2 of 
these subareas are determined separately. Note that a single resultant 
could be determined by using the composite technique for finding cen­
troids, which was discussed in Art. 5/4. Usually, however, the determi­
nation of a single resultant is unnecessary. 
For a more general load distribution, Fig. 5/21, we must start with a 
differential increment of force dR = w dx. The total load R is then the 
sum of the differential forces, or 
R = J w dx 
As before, the resultant R is located at the centroid of the area under 
consideration. The x-coordinate of this centroid is found by the principle 
of moments RX = f xw dx, or

Once the distributed loads have been reduced to their equivalent

5 / 7  B E A M S  - I NT E R N A L  EFFECTS 
The previous article treated the reduction of a distributed force to 
one or more equivalent concentrated forces and the subsequent determi­
nation of the external reactions acting on the beam. In this article we in­
troduce internal beam effects and apply principles of statics to calculate 
the internal shear force and bending moment as functions of location 
along the beam. 
Shear, Bending, and Torsion 
In addition to supporting tension or compression, a beam can resist 
shear, bending, and torsion. These three effects are illustrated in Fig. 
5/22. The force V is called the shear force, the couple M is called the 
bending moment, and the couple T is called a torsional moment. These 
effects represent the vector components of the resultant of the forces 
acting on a transverse section of the beam as shown in the lower part of 
the figure. 
Consider the shear force V and bending moment M caused by forces 
applied to the beam in a single plane. The conventions for positive val­
ues of shear V and bending moment M shown in Fig. 5/23 are the ones 
generally used. From the principle of action and reaction we can see 
that the directions of V and M are reversed on the two sections. It is fre­
quently impossible to tell without calculation whether the shear and 
moment at a particular section are positive or negative. For this reason 
it is advisable to represent V and M in their positive directions on the 
free-body diagrams and let the algebraic signs of the calculated values 
indicate the proper directions. 
As an aid to the physical interpretation of the bending couple M, 
consider the beam shown in Fig. 5/24 bent by the two equal and opposite 
positive moments applied at the ends. The cross section of the beam is 
treated as an H-section with a very narrow center web and heavy top 
and bottom flanges. For this beam we may neglect the load carried by 
the small web compared with that carried by the two flanges. The upper 
flange of the beam clearly is shortened and is under compression, 
whereas the lower flange is lengthened and is under tension. The resul­
tant of the two forces, one tensile and the other compressive, acting on 
any section is a couple and has the value of the bending moment on the 
section. If a beam having some other cross-sectional shape were loaded

in the same way, the distribution of force over the cross section would 
be different, but the resultant would be the same couple. 
Shea!'-Force and Bending-Moment Diagrams 
The variation of shear force V and bending moment M over the 
length of a beam provides information necessary for the design analysis 
of the beam. In particular, the maximum magnitude of the bending mo­
ment is usually the primary consideration in the design or selection of a 
beam, and its value and position should be determined. The variations 
in shear and moment are best shown graphically, and the expressions 
for V and M when plotted against distance along the beam give the 
shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the beam. 
The first step in the determination of the shear and moment rela­
tions is to establish the values of all external reactions on the beam by 
applying the equations of equilibrium to a free-body diagram of the 
beam as a whole. Next, we isolate a portion of the beam, either to the 
right or to the left of an arbitrary transverse section, with a free-body 
diagram, and apply the equations of equilibrium to this isolated portion 
of the beam. These equations wil yield expressions for the shear force V 
and bending moment M acting at the cut section on the part of the beam 
isolated. The part of the beam which involves the smaller number of 
forces, either to the right or to the left of the arbitrary section, usually 
yields the simpler solution. 
We should avoid using a transverse section which coincides with the 
location of a concentrated load or couple, as such a position represents a 
point of discontinuity in the variation of shear or bending moment. Fi­
nally, it is important to note that the calculations for V and M on each 
section chosen should be consistent with the positive convention illus­
trated in Fig. 5/23. 
General Loading, Shear, and Moment Relationships 
For any beam with distributed loads, we can establish certain gen­
eral relationships which will aid greatly in the determination of the 
shear and moment distributions along the beam. Figure 5/25 represents 
a portion of a loaded beam, where an element dx of the beam is isolated. 
The loading w represents the force per unit length of beam. At the loca­
tion x the shear V and moment M acting on the element are drawn in 
their positive directions. On the opposite side of the element where the 
Figure 5/25

ness, the 1-beam is a very common 
structu ral element. 
coordinate is x + dx, these quantities are also shown in their positive di­
rections. They must, however, be labeled V + dV and M + dM, since V 
and M change with x. The applied loading w may be considered constant 
over the length of the element, since this length is a differential quan­
tity and the effect of any change in w disappears in the limit compared 
with the effect of w itself. 
Equilibrium of the element requires that the sum of the vertical 
forces be zero. Thus, we have 
V - w dx - (V + dV) = 0 
or 
(510) 
We see from Eq. 5110 that the slope of the shear diagram must 
everywhere be equal to the negative of the value of the applied loading. 
Equation 5/10 holds on either side of a concentrated load but not at the 
concentrated load because of the discontinuity produced by the abrupt 
change in shear. 
We may now express the shear force V in terms of the loading w by 
integrating Eq. 5/10. Thus, 
or 
V = V0 + (the negative of the area under 
the loading curve from x0 to x) 
In this expression V0 is the shear force at Xo and V is the shear force at x. 
Summing the area under the loading curve is usually a simple way to 
construct the shear-force diagram. 
Equilibrium of the element in Fig. 5/25 also requires that the mo­
ment sum be zero. Summing moments about the left side of the element 
gives 
M + w dx ď + (V + dV) dx - (M + dM) = 0 
The two Ms cancel, and the terms w(dx'f/2 and dV dx may be dropped, 
since they are differentials of higher order than those which remain. 
This leaves

Bea m s - I nt e r n a l  Effects 279 
which expresses the met that the shear everywhere is equal to the slope 
of the moment curve. Equation 5/1 1 holds on either side of a concen­
trated couple but not at the concentrated couple because of the disconti­
nuity caused by the abrupt change in moment. 
We may now express the moment M in terms of the shear V by inte­
grating Eq. 5/11. Thus, 
or 
M = M0 + ( area under the shear diagram from x0 to x) 
In this expression M0 is the bending moment at x0 and M is the bend­
ing moment at x. For beams where there is no externally applied mo­
ment M0 at x0 = 0, the total moment at any section equals the area 
under the shear diagram up to that section. Summing the area under 
the shear diagram is usually the simplest way to construct the mo­
ment diagram. 
When V passes through zero and is a continuous function of x with 
dV/dx ˣ 0, the bending moment M will be a maximum or a minimum, 
since dM/dx = 0 at such a point. Critical values of M also occur when V 
crosses the zero axis discontinuously, which occurs for beams under 
concentrated loads. 
We observe from Eqs. 5/10 and 5/1 1 that the degree of V in x is one 
higher than that of w. Also, M is of one higher degree in x than is V. Con­
sequently, M is two degrees higher in x than w. Thus for a beam loaded 
by w = kx, which is of the first degree in x, the shear V is of the second 
degree in x and the bending moment M is of the third degree in x. 
Equations 5/10 and 5/1 1  may be combined to yield 
(5/12) 
Thus, if w is a known function of x, the moment M can be obtained by 
two integrations, provided that the limits of integration are properly 
evaluated each time. This method is usable only if w is a continuous 
function of x. * 
When bending in a beam occurs in more than a single plane, we 
may perform a separate analysis in each plane and combine the results 
vectorially. 
*When w is a discontinuous function of x, it is possible to introduce a special set of expres­
sions called singularity functions which permit writing analytical expressions for shear V and 
moment M over an interval which includes discontinuities. These functions are not discussed 
in this bok.

G) In this case of symmetry, it is clear 
that the resultant R = V0 = 2w0l11r of 
the load distribution acts at midspan, 
so that the moment requirement is 
simply M0 - -Rl/2 - -w0l2/7r. The

bending moment at x = 0 is opposite 
to that represented on the fre-body

® The free-body diagram serves to 
remind us that the integration 
limits for V as well as for x must be

It should be noted that V and M are represented in their positive directions. A 
vertical-force summation and a moment summation about the section yield 
V =  - 1.767 kN 
and 
M = 7.33 - 1.767x 
These values of V and M are plotted on the shear and moment diagrams for the 
interval 4 < x < 5 m. 
The last interval may be analyzed by inspection. The shear is constant at 
+ 1.5 kN, and the moment follows a straight-line relation beginning with zero at 
the right end of the beam. 
The maximum moment occurs at x = 2.23 m, where the shear curve crosses 
the zero axis, and the magnitude of M is obtained for this value of x by substitu­
tion into the expression for M for the second interval. The maximum moment is 
M = 1.827 kN ·m

As before, note that the change in moment M up to any section equals the 
area under the shear diagram up to that section. For instance, for x < 2 m,

f L E X I B L E  CABLES 
One important type of structural member is the flexible cable which 
is used in suspension bridges, transmission lines, messenger cables for 
supporting heavy trolley or telephone lines, and many other applica­
tions. To design these structures we must know the relations involving 
the tension, span, sag, and length of the cables. We determine these 
quantities by examining the cable as a body in equilibrium. In the analy­
sis of flexible cables we assume that any resistance offered to bending is 
negligible. This assumption means that the force in the cable is always 
in the direction of the cable. 
Flexible cables may support a series of distinct concentrated load.s, 
as shown in Fig. 5/26a, or they may support loads continuously distrib­
uted over the length of the cable, as indicated by the variable-intensity 
loading w in 5/26b. In some instances the weight of the cable is negligi­
ble compared with the loads it supports. In other cases the weight of 
the cable may be an appreciable load or the sole load and cannot be 
neglected. Regardless of which of these conditions is present, the equi­
librium requirements of the cable may be formulated in the same 
manner. 
General Relationships 
If the intensity of the variable and continuous load applied to the 
cable of Fig. 5/26b is expressed as w units of force per unit of horizontal 
length x, then the resultant R of the vertical loading is 
R =J dR = J w dx 
(c) 
(b) 
Figure 5/26 

where the integration is taken over the desired interval. We find the po­
sition of R from the moment principle, so that 
Rx = J x dR 
_ J x dR 
x = --
R 
The elemental load dR = w dx is represented by an elemental strip of 
vertical length w and width dx of the shaded area of the loading dia­
gram, and R is represented by the total area. It follows from the forego­
ing expressions that R passes through the centroid of the shaded area. 
The equilibrium condition of the cable is satisfied if each infinitesi­
mal element of the cable is in equilibrium. The free-body diagram of a 
differential element is shown in Fig. 5/26c. At the general position x the 
tension in the cable is T, and the cable makes an angle 0 with the hori­
zontal x-direction. At the section x + dx the tension is T + dT, and the 
angle is 0 + dO. Note that the changes in both T and 0 are taken to be 
positive with a positive change in x. The vertical load w dx completes the 
free-body diagram. The equilibrium of vertical and horizontal forces re­
quires, respectively, that 
(T + dT) sin (0 + dO) -= T sin 0 + w dx 
(T + dT) cos (O + dO) = T cos 0 
The trigonometric expansion for the sine and cosine of the sum of two 
angles and the substitutions sin do = dO and cos dO = 1, which hold in 
the limit as dO approaches zero, yield 
(T + dT)(sin 0 + cos O dO) = T sin 0 + w dx 
(T + dT)(cos 0 - sin 0 dO) = T cos 8 
Dropping the second-order terms and simplifying give us 
which we write as 
T cos 0 dO + dT sin 0 = w dx 
-T sin 8 dO + dT cos 0 = 0 
d(T sin 8) = w dx 
and 
d(T cos 0) = 0 
The second relation expresses the fact that the horizontal component of 
T remains unchanged, which is clear from the free-body diagram. If we 
introduce the symbol T0 = T cos 0 for this constant horizontal force, we 
may then substitute T = T0/cos 0 into the first of the two equations just 
derived and obtain d(T0 tan 8) = w dx. Because tan 8 = dy/dx, the equi­
librium equation may be written in the form

Equation 5113 is the differential equation for the flexible cable. The 
solution to the equation is that functional relation y = f(x) which satis­
fies the equation and also satisfies the conditions at the fixed ends of the 
cable, called boundary conditions. This relationship defines the shape of 
the cable, and we will use it to solve two important and limiting cases of 
cable loading. 
Parabolic Cable 
When the intensity of vertical loading w is constant, the condition 
closely approximates that of a suspension bridge where the uniform 
weight of the roadway may be expressed by the constant w. The mass of 
the cable itself is not distributed unifonnly with the horizontal but is 
relatively small, and thus we neglect its weight. For this limiting case 
we will prove that the cable hangs in a parabolic arc. 
We start with a cable suspended from two points A and B which are 
not on the same horizontal line, Fig. 5127a. We place the coordinate ori­
gin at the lowest point of the cable, where the tension is horizontal and 
is T0• Integration of Eq. 5/13 once with respect to x gives

integration. Equation 5114 gives the shape of the cable, which we see is 
a vertical parabola. The constant horizontal component of cable tension 
becomes the cable tension at the origin. 
Inserting the corresponding values x = ZA and y = hA in Eq. 5/14 
gives 
so that 
The tension T is found from a free-body diagram of a finite portion of 
the cable, shown in Fig. 5/27b. From the Pythagorean theorem 
Elimination of T0 gives

The maximum tension occurs where x = ZA and is

Although we can integrate this expression in closed form, for computa­

gent series and then integrate it term by term. For this purpose we use

This series is convergent for values of hA/lA < Ì. which holds for most

The relationships which apply to the cable section from the origin to 
point B can be easily obtained by replacing hA, ZA, and sA by h8, l8, and 
s8, respectively.

Catenary Cable 
Consider now a uniform cable, Fig. 5/29a, suspended from two 
points A and B and hanging under the action of its own weight only. We 
will show in this limiting case that the cable assumes a curved shape 
known as a catenary. 
The free-body diagram of a finite portion of the cable of length s 
measured from the origin is shown in part b of the figure. This free-body 
diagram differs from the one in Fig. 5/27b in that the total vertical force 
supported is equal to the weight of the cable section of length s rather

than the load distributed uniformly with respect to the horizontal. If the 
cable has a weight JL per unit of its length, the resultant R of the load is 
R = JLS, and the incremental vertical load w dx of Fig. 5/26c is replaced 
by JL ds. With this replacement the differential relation, Eq. 5/13, for the 
cable becomes

We may also express the tension in terms of y with the aid of Eq. 5/19,

T = To + 1-LY 
(5122) 
Equation 5/22 shows that the change in cable tension from that at the 
lowest position depends only on p.y. 
Most problems dealing with the catenary involve solutions of Eqs. 
5/19 through 5/22, which can be handled by a graphical approximation 
or solved by computer. The procedure for a graphical or computer solu­
tion is illustrated in Sample Problem 5/17 following this article. 
The solution of catenary problems where the sag-to-span ratio is 
small may be approximated by the relations developed for the parabolic 
cable. A small sag-to-span ratio means a tight cable, and the uniform 
distribution of weight along the cable is not very different from the 
same load intensity distributed uniformly along the horizontal. 
Many problems dealing with both the catenary and parabolic cables 
involve suspension points which are not on the same level. In such cases 
we may apply the relations just developed to the part of the cable on 
each side of the lowest point.

Sample Problem 5/ 1 8  
Replace the cable of Sample Problem 5/17, which is loaded uni­
formly along the horizontal, by a cable which has a mass of 12 kg per 
meter of its own length and supports its own weight only. The cable is 
suspended between two points on the same level 300 m apart and has a 
sag of60 m. Find the tension at midlength, the maximum tension. and 
the total length of the cable. 
Solution. With a load distributed uniformly along the length of 
the cable, the solution of part (c) of Art. 5/8 applies, and we have 
a catenary shape of the cable. Equations 5120 and 5/21 for the 
cable length and tension both involve the minimum tension T0 at 
midlength, which must be found from Eq. 5/19. Thus, for x "' 150 m, 
y = 60 m, and IL = 12(9.81)(10-3) = 0.1 177 kN/m, we have

fLU I D  STATICS 
So far in this chapter we have treated the action of forces on and be­
tween solid bodies. In this article we consider the equilibrium of bodies 
subjected to forces due to fluid pressures. A fluid is any continuous sub­
stance which, when at rest, is unable to support shear force. A shear 
force is one tangent to the surface on which it acts and is developed 
when differential velocities exist between adjacent layers of fluids. Thus, 
a fluid at rest can exert only normal forces on a bounding surface. Fluids 
may be either gaseous or liquid. The statics of fluids is generally called 
hydrostatics when the fluid is a liquid and aerostatics when the fluid is 
a gas. 
Fluid Pressure 
The pressure at any given point in a fluid is the same in all direc­
tions (Pascal's law). We may prove this by considering the equilibrium 
of an infinitesimal triangular prism of fluid as shown in Fig. 5/30. The 
fluid pressures normal to the faces of the element are Pt> P2, p3, andp4 as 
shown. With force equal to pressure times area, the equilibrium of 
forces in the x- and y-directions gives 
Pt dy dz = p3 ds dz sin 0 
P2 dx dz = Ps ds dz cos 0 
Since ds sin 0 = dy and ds cos 0 = dx, these questions require that 
P1 = P2 = Ps = P 
By rotating the element through 90", we see that p4 is also equal to the 
other pressures. Thus, the pressure at any point in a fluid at rest is 
the same in all directions. In this analysis we need not account for the 
weight of the fluid element because, when the weight per unit volume 
(density p times g) is multiplied by the volume of the element, a differ­
ential quantity of third order results which disappears in the limit com­
pared with the second-order pressure-force terms. 
In all fluids at rest, the pressure is a function of the vertical dimen­
sion. To determine this function, we consider the forces acting on a dif­
ferential element of a vertical column of fluid of cross-sectional area dA, 
as shown in Fig. 5/31. The positive direction of vertical measurement h 
is taken downward. The pressure on the upper face is p, and that on the 
lower face is p plus the change in p, or p + dp. The weight of the ele­
ment equals pg multiplied by its volume. The normal forces on the lat­
eral surface, which are horizontal and do not affect the balance of forces 
in the vertical direction, are not shown. Equilibrium of the fluid element 
in the h-direction requires 
p dA + pg dA dh - (p + dp) dA = 0 
dp = pg dh 
(5/23) 
This differential relation shows us that the pressure in a fluid increases 
with depth or decreases with increased elevation. Equation 5/23 holds

for both liquids and gases, and agrees with our common observations of 
air and water pressures. 
Fluids which are essentially incompressible are called liquids, and 
for most practical purposes we may consider their density p constant for 
every part of the liquid.* With p a constant, integration of Eq. 5/23 gives 
( P = Po + pgh) 
(5124) 
The pressure Po is the pressure on the surface of the liquid where h = 0. 
If p0 is due to atmospheric pressure and the measuring instrument 
records only the increment above atmospheric pressure,t the measure­
ment gives what is called gage pressure. lt is computed from p = pgh. 
The common unit for pressure in SI units is the kilopascal (kPa), 
which is the same as a kilonewton per square meter ( 103 N/mË. In com­
puting pressure, if we use Mg/m8 for p, mls2 for g, and m for h, then the 
product pgh gives us pressure in k.Pa directly. For example, the pressure 
at a depth of 10 m in fresh water is 
( 
Mg)(

kg· m 1 )

ma

m2 
= 98.1 kN/m2 = 98.1 kPa 
In the U.S. customary system, fluid pressure is generally expressed 
in pounds per square inch (lhlin. 2) or occasionally in pounds per square 
foot (lblft2). Thus, at a depth of 10 ft in fresh water the pressure is 
P = pgh = ( s2.4 :a)(17128 i=a )<120 in. ) = 4.33 lbtin.2 
Hydrostatic Pressure on Submerged Rectangular Surfaces 
A body submerged in a liquid, such as a gate valve in a dam or the 
wall of a tank, is subjected to fluid pressure acting normal to its surface 
and distributed over its area. In problems where fluid forces are appre­
ciable, we must determine the resultant force due to the distribution of 
pressure on the surface and the position at which this resultant acts. 
For systems open to the atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure p0 acts 
over all surfaces and thus yields a zero resultant. In such cases, then, we 
need to consider only the gage pressure p = pgh, which is the increment 
above atmospheric pressure. 
Consider the special but common case of the action of hydrostatic 
pressure on the surface of a rectangular plate submerged in a liquid. 
Figure 5/32a shows such a plate 1-2-3-4 with its top edge horizontal and 
with the plane of the plate making an arbitrary angle 0 with the vertical 
plane. The horizontal surface of the liquid is represented by the x-y' 
plane. The fluid pressure (gage) acting normal to the plate at point 2 is 
*Se Table D/1, Appendix D, for table of den!lities. 
'Atmospheric presure at sea level may be taken to be 101.8 kPa or 14.7 lblin.2 

represented by the arrow 6-2 and equals pg times the vertical distance 
from the liquid surface to point 2. This same pressure acts at all points 
along the edge 2Í3. At point 1 on the lower edge, the ftuid pressure 
equals pg times the depth of point 1, and this pressure is the same at all 
points along edge 1-4. The variation of pressure p over the area of the 
plate is governed by the linear depth relationship and therefore it is re 
resented by the arrow p, shown in Fig. 5/32b, which varies linearly from 
the value 6-2 to the value 5-1. The resultant force produced by this pres­
sure distribution is represented by R, which acts at some point P called 
the center of pressure. 
The conditions which prevail at the vertical section 1-2-6-5 in Fig. 5/32a 
are identical to those at section 4-3-7-8 and at every other vertical sec­
tion normal to the plate. Thus, we may analyze the problem from the 
two-dimensional view of a vertical section as shown in Fig. 5/32b for sec­
tion 1-2-6-5. For this section the pressure distribution is trapezoidal. If b 
is the horizontal width of the plate measured normal to the plane of the 
figure (dimension 2-3 in Fig. 5/32a), an element of plate area over which

Figure 5133 
the pressure p = pgh acts is dA = b dy, and an increment of the result­
ant force is dR = p dA = bp dy. But p dy is merely the shaded increment 
of trapezoidal area dA', so that dR = b dA'. We may therefore express 
the resultant force acting on the entire plate as the trapezoidal area 
1-2-6-5 times the width b of the plate, 
R = b f dA' = bA' 
Be careful not to confuse the physical area A of the plate with the geo­
metrical area A' defined by the trapezoidal distribution of pressure. 
The trapezoidal area representing the pressure distribution is easily 
expressed by using its average altitude. The resultant force R may 
therefore be written in terms of the average pressure Pav = Æ (p1 + P2) 
times the plate area A. The average pressure is also the pressure which 
exists at the average depth, measured to the centroid 0 of the plate. An 
alternative expression for R is therefore 
R = PavA = pghA 
where h = y cos (}. 
We obtain the line of action of the resultant force R from the princi­
ple of moments. Using the x-axis (point B in Fig. 5/32b) as the moment 
axis yields RY = f y(pb dy). Substituting p dy = dA' and R = bA' and 
canceling b give 
which is simply the expression for the centroidal coordinate of the trape­
zoidal area A'. In the two-dimensional view, therefore, the resultant R 
passes through the centroid C of the trapezoidal area defined by the 
pressure distribution in the vertical section. Clearly Y also locates the 
centroid C of the truncated prism 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 in Fig. 5/32a through 
which the resultant passes. 
For a trapezoidal distribution of pressure, we may simplify the 
calculation by dividing the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle, 
Fig. 5/32c, and separately considering the force represented by each 
part. The force represented by the rectangular portion acts at the cen­
ter 0 of the plate and is R2 = pÇ, where A is the area 1-2-3-4 of the 
plate. The force R 1 represented by the triangular increment of pressure 
distribution is È(p1 - p2)A and acts through the centroid of the trian­
gular portion shown. 
Hydrostatic Pressure on Cylindrical Surfaces 
The determination of the resultant R due to distributed pressure on 
a submerged curved surface involves more calculation than for a flat 
surface. For example, consider the submerged cylindrical surface shown 
in Fig. 5133a where the elements of the curved surface are parallel to the 
horizontal surface x-y' of the liquid. Vertical sections perpendicular to the 
surface al disclose the same curve AB and the same pressure distribution. 

Thus, the two-dimensional representation in Fig. 5/33b may be used. 
To find R by a direct integration, we need to integrate the x- and y­
components of dR along the curve AB, since dR continuously changes 
direction. Thus, 
R., = b f (p dL)., = b f p dy 
and 
A moment equation would now be required if we wished to establish 
the position of R. 
A second method for finding R is usually much simpler. Consider 
the equilibrium of the block of liquid ABC directly above the surface, 
shown in Fig. 5/33c. The resultant R then appears as the equal and 
opposite reaction of the surface on the block of liquid. The resultants 
of the pressures along AC and CB are Py and Px, respectively, and are 
easily obtained. The weight W of the liquid block is calculated from 
the area ABC of its section multiplied by the constant dimension b 
and by pg. The weight W passes through the centroid of area ABC. 
The equilibrant R is then determined completely from the equilib­
rium equations which we apply to the free-body diagram of the fluid 
block. 
Hydrostatic Pressure on Flat Surfaces of Any Shape 
Figure 5/34a shows a flat plate of any shape submerged in a liq­
uid. The horizontal surface of the liquid is the plane x-y', and the 
plane of the plate makes an angle 0 with the vertical. The force acting 
on a differential strip of area dA parallel to the surface of the liquid 
is dR = p dA = pgh dA. The pressure p has the same magnitude 
throughout the length of the strip, because there is no change of 
'x

depth along the strip. We obtain the total force acting on the exposed 
area A by integration, which gives 
R = I dR = I p dA = pg I h dA 
Substituting the centroidal relation hA = f h dA gives us 
R = pghA 
(5125) 
The quantity pgh is the pressure which exists at the depth of the cen­
troid 0 of the area and is the average pressure over the area. 
We may also represent the resultant R geometrically by the volume 
V' of the figure shown in Fig. 5/34b. Here the fluid pressure p is repre­
sented as a dimension normal to the plate regarded as a base. We see 
that the resulting volume is a truncated right cylinder. The force dR 
acting on the diferential area dA = x dy is represented by the elemental 
volume p dA shown by the shaded slice, and the total force is repre­
sented by the total volume of the cylinder. We see from Eq. 5/25 that the 
average altitude of the truncated cylinder is the average pressure pgh 
which exists at a depth corresponding to the centroid 0 of the area ex­
posed to pressure. 
For problems where the centroid 0 or the volume V' is not readily 
apparent, a direct integration may be performed to obtain R. Thus, 
R = I dR = I p dA = I pghx dy 
where the depth h and the length x of the horizontal strip of differential 
area must be expressed in terms of y to carry out the integration. 
After the resultant is obtained, we must determine its location. 
Using the principle of moments with the x-axis of Fig. 5/34b as the mo­
ment axis, we obtain 
_ I y(px dy) 
Y = -'---::---
I px dy 
or 
(5/26) 
This second relation satisfies the definition of the coordinate Y to the 
centroid of the volume V' of the pressure-area truncated cylinder. We 
conclude, therefore, that the resultant R passes through the centroid C 
of the volume described by the plate area as base and the linearly vary­
ing pressure as the perpendicular coordinate. The point P at which R is 
applied to the plate is the center of pressure. Note that the center of 
pressure P and the centroid 0 of the plate area are not the same. 
Buoyancy 
Archimedes is credited with discovering the principle of buoyancy. 
This principle is easily explained for any fluid, gaseous or liquid, in equi­
librium. Consider a portion of the fluid defined by an imaginary closed

surface, as illustrated by the irregular dashed boundary in Fig. 5/35a. If 
the body of the :fluid could be sucked out from within the closed cavity 
and replaced simultaneously by the forces which it exerted on the 
boundary of the cavity, Fig. 5/35b, the equilibrium of the surrounding 
fluid would not be disturbed. Furthermore, a free-body diagram of the 
fluid portion before removal, Fig. 5/35c, shows that the resultant of the 
pressure forces distributed over its surface must be equal and opposite 
to its weight mg and must pass through the center of mass of the fluid 
element. H we replace the fluid element by a body of the same dimen­
sions, the surface forces acting on the body held in this position will be 
identical to those acting on the fluid element. Thus, the resultant force 
exerted on the surface of an object immersed in a fluid is equal and op­
posite to the weight of :fluid displaced and passes through the center of 
mass of the displaced fluid. This resultant force is called the force of 
buoyancy 
(5127) 
where p is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, 
and V is the volume of the fluid displaced. In the case of a liquid whose 
density is constant, the center of mass of the displaced liquid coincides 
with the centroid of the displaced volume. 
Thus when the density of an object is less than the density of the 
fluid in which it is fully immersed, there is an imbalance of force in the 
vertical direction, and the object rises. When the immersing fluid is a 
liquid, the object continues to rise until it comes to the surface of the liq­
uid and then comes to rest in an equilibrium position, assuming that the 
density of the new fluid above the surface is less than the density of the 
object. In the case of the surface boundary between a liquid and a gas, 
such as water and air, the effect of the gas pressure on that portion of 
the floating object above the liquid is balanced by the added pressure in 
the liquid due to the action of the gas on its surface. 
An important problem involving buoyancy is the determination of 
the stability of a floating object, such as a ship hull shown in cross sec­
tion in an upright position in Fig. 5/36a. Point B is the centroid of the 
displaced volume and is called the center of buoyancy. The resultant of 
the forces exerted on the hull by the water pressure is the buoyancy 
force F which passes through B and is equal and opposite to the weight 
W of the ship. Ifthe ship is caused to list through an angle a, Fig. 5/36b,

the shape of the displaced volume changes, and the center of buoyancy 
shifts to B'. 
The point of intersection of the vertical line through B' with the 
centerline of the ship is called the metacenter M, and the distance h of M 
from the center of mass G is called the metacentric height. For most hull 
shapes h remains practic.ally constant for angles of list up to about 20°. 
When M is above G, as in Fig. 5136b, there is a righting moment which 
tends to bring the ship back to its upright position. If M is below G, as 
for the hull of Fig. 5136c, the moment accompanying the list is in the di­
rection to increase the list. This is clearly a condition of instability and 
must be avoided in the design of any ship. 
Wind-tunnel testing of this fu l l-scale car is extremely useful 
in pred icting its performance. 

Sample Problem 5/ 1 9  
A rectangular plate, shown in vertical se<.tion AB, is 4 m high and 6 m wide 
(normal to the plane of the paper) and blocks the end of a fresh-water channel 3 m 
deep. The plate is hinged about a horizontal axis along its upper edge through A 
and is restrained from opening by the fixed ridge B which bears horizontally against 
the lower edge of the plate. Find the force B exerted on the plate by the ridge. 
Solution. The free-body diagram of the plate is shown in section and includes 
the vertical and horizontal components of the force at A, the unspecified weight 
W = mg of the plate, the unknown horizontal force B, and the resultant R of the 
triangular distribution of pressure against the vertical face.

Solution. The pressure distribution on the end surface is shown, where 
Po = 5.5 kPa. The specific wei,ght of fresh water is p. = pg = 1000(9.81) = 9.81 kN!m3

We locate R by applying the moment principle about A noting that R1 acts 
through the center of the 760-mm depth and that R2 acts through the centroid

gram is drawn. The force P" is 
Px = pghA = p:r br = (l.000)a'81)(4) (30)(4) = 2350 kN

In Chapter 5 we have studied various common examples of forces distributed 
throughout volumes, over areas, and along lines. In al these problems we often 
need to determine the resultant of the distributed forces and the location of the 
resultant. 
Finding Resultants of Distributed Forces 
To find the resultant and line of action of a distributed force: 
1. Begin by multiplying the intensity of the force by the appropriate element 
of volume, area, or length in terms of which the intensity is expressed. 
Then sum (integrate) the incremental forces over the region involved to 
obtain their resultant. 
2. To locate the line of action of the resultant, use the principle of moments. 
Evaluate the sum of the moments, about a convenient axis, of all of the 
increments of force. Equate this sum to the moment of the resultant about 
the same axis. Then solve for the unknown moment arm of the resultant. 
Gravitational Forces 
When force is distributed throughout a mass, as in the 
case 
of 
gravitational attraction, the intensity is the force of attraction pg per unit 
of volume, where p is the density and g is the gravitational acceleration. For 
bodies whose density is constant, we saw in Section A that pg cancels when 
the moment principle is applied. This leaves us with a strictly geometric 
problem of finding the centroid of the figure, which coincides with the mass 
center of the physical body whose boundary defines the figure. 
1. For flat plates and shells which are homogeneous and have constant 
thickness, the problem becomes one of finding the properties of an area. 
2. For slender rods and wires of uniform density and constant cross section, 
the problem becomes one of finding the properties of a line segment. 
Integration of Differential Relationships 
For problems which require the integration of differential relationships, 
keep in mind the following considerations. 
1. Select a coordinate system which provides the simplest description of the 
boundaries of the region of integration. 
2. Eliminate higher-order differential 
quantities whenever lower-order 
differential quantities will remain. 
8. Choose a first-order differential element in preference to a second­
order element and a second-order element in preference to a third-order 
element. 

322 C h a pter 5 Distri buted Forces 
4. Whenever possible, choose a differential element which avoids discontinu­
ities within the region of integration. 
Distributed Forces in Beams, Cables, and Fluids 
In Section B we used these guidelines along with the principles of 
equilibrium to solve for the effects of distributed forces in beams, cables, and 
fiuids. Remember that: 
1. For beams and cables the force intensity is expressed as force per unit 
length. 
2. For fluids the force intensity is expressed as force per unit area, or 
pressure. 
Although beams, cables, and fluids are physically quite different applications, 
their problem formulations share the common elements cited above.

INTRODU CTI O N  
In the preceding chapters we have usually assumed that the forces 
of action and reaction between contacting surfaces act normal to the 
surfaces. This assumption characterizes the interaction between smooth 
surfaces and was illustrated in Example 2 of Fig. 3/1. Although this 
ideal assumption often involves only a relatively small error, there are 
many problems in which we must consider the ability of contacting sur­
faces to support tangential as well as normal forces. Tangential forces 
generated between contacting surfaces are caled friction forces and 
occur to some degree in the interaction between al real surfaces. When­
ever a tendency exists for one contacting surface to slide along another 
surface, the friction forces developed are always in a direction to oppose 
this tendency. 
In some types of machines and processes we want to minimize the 
retarding effect of friction forces. Examples are bearings of al types, 
power screws, gears, the flow of fluids in pipes, and the propulsion of 
aircraft and missiles through the atmosphere. In other situations we 
wish to maximize the effects of friction, as in brakes, clutches, belt

drives, and wedges. Wheeled vehicles depend on friction for both start­
ing and stopping, and ordinary walking depends on friction between the 
shoe and the ground. 
Friction forces are present throughout nature and exist in all ma­
chines no matter how accurately constructed or carefully lubricated. A 
machine or process in which friction is small enough to be neglected is 
said to be ideal. When friction must be taken into account, the machine 
or process is termed real. In al cases where there is sliding motion be­
tween parts, the friction forces result in a loss of energy which is dissi­
pated in the form of heat. Wear is another effect of friction. 
SECTION A FRICTIONAL PHENOMENA 
6/2 TYPES OF FR ICTION 
In this article we briefly discuss the types of frictional resistance 
encountered in mechanics. The next article contains a more detailed 
account of the most common type of friction, dry friction. 
(a) Dry Friction. Dry friction occurs when the unlubricated surfaces 
of two solids are in contact under a condition of sliding or a tendency to 
slide. A friction force tangent to the surfaces of contact occurs both dur­
ing the interval leading up to impending slippage and while slippage 
takes place. The direction of this friction force always opposes the mo­
tion or impending motion. This type of friction is also called Coulomb 
friction. The principles of dry or Coulomb friction were developed 
largely from the experiments of Coulomb in 1781 and from the work of 
Morin from 1831 to 1834. Although we do not yet have a comprehensive 
theory of dry friction, in Art. 6/3 we describe an analytical model suffi­
cient to handle the vast majority of problems involving dry friction. This 
model forms the basis for most of this chapter. 
(b) Fluid Friction. Fluid friction occurs when adjacent layers in a 
fluid (liquid or gas) are moving at different velocities. This motion 
causes frictional forces between fluid elements, and these forces depend 
on the relative velocity between layers. When there is no relative veloc­
ity, there is no fluid friction. Fluid friction depends not only on the 
velocity gradients within the fluid but also on the viscosity of the fluid, 
which is a measure of its resistance to shearing action between fluid 
layers. Fluid friction is treated in the study of fluid mechanics and will 
not be discussed further in this book. 
(c) Internal Friction. Internal friction occurs in all solid materials 
which are subjected to cyclical loading. For highly elastic materials the 
recovery from deformation occurs with very little loss of energy due to 
internal friction. For materials which have low limits of elasticity and 
which undergo appreciable plastic deformation during loading, a consid­
erable amount of internal friction may accompany this deformation. 
The mechanism of internal friction is associated with the action of shear 
deformation, which is discussed in references on materials science. 

Because this book deals primarily with the external effects of forces, we 
will not discuss internal friction further. 
6/3 DRY FR I CTION 
The remainder of this chapter describes the effects of dry friction 
acting on the exterior surfaces of rigid bodies. We will now explain the 
mechanism of dry friction with the aid of a very simple experiment. 
Mechanism of Dry Friction 
Consider a solid block of mass m resting on a horizontal surface, as 
shown in Fig. 6/la. We assume that the contacting surfaces have some 
roughness. The experiment involves the application of a horizontal force 
P which continuously increases from zero to a value sufficient to move 
the block and give it an appreciable velocity. The free-body diagram of 
the block for any value of Pis shown in Fig. 6/lb, where the tangential 
friction force exerted by the plane on the block is labeled F. This friction 
force acting on the body will always be in a direction to oppose motion or 
the tendency toward motion of the body. There is al.so a normal force 
N which in this case equals mg, and the total forceR exerted by the sup­
porting surface on the block is the resultant of Nand F. 
A magnified view of the irregularities of the mating surfaces, 
Fig. 6/lc, helps us to visualize the mechanical action of friction. Support 
is necessarily intermittent and exists at the mating humps. The direc­
tion of each of the reactions on the block, R1, R2, R3, etc., depends not

only on the geometric profile of the irregularities but also on the extent 
of local deformation at each contact point. The total normal force N is the 
sum of the n-components of the R's, and the total frictional force F is the 
sum of the t-components of the R's. When the surfaces are in relative 
motion, the contacts are more nearly along the tops of the humps, and 
the t-components of the R's are smaller than when the surfaces are at 
rest relative to one another. This observation helps to explain the well­
known fact that the force P necessary to maintain motion is generally 
less than that required to start the block when the irregularities are 
more nearly in mesh. 
If we perform the experiment and record the friction force F as a 
function of P, we obtain the relation shown in Fig. 6/ld. When P is zero, 
equilibrium requires that there be no friction force. As P is increased, 
the friction force must be equal and opposite to P as long as the block 
does not slip. During this period the block is in equilibrium, and all 
forces acting on the block must satisfy the equilibrium equations. Fi­
nally, we reach a value of P which causes the block to slip and to move 
in the direction of the applied force. At this same time the friction force 
decreases slightly and abruptly. It then remains essentially constant 
for a time but then decreases still more as the velocity increases. 
Static Friction 
The region in Fig. 6/ld up to the point of slippage or impending mo­
tion is called the range of static friction, and in this range the value of 
the friction force is determined by the equations of equilibrium. This 
friction force may have any value from zero up to and including the 
maximum value. For a given pair of mating surfaces the experiment 
shows that this maximum value of static friction F max is proportional to 
the normal force N. Thus, we may write 
(6/1) 
where JLs is the proportionality constant, called the coefficient of static 
friction. 
Be aware that Eq. 6/1 describes only the limiting or maximum value 
of the static friction force and not any lesser value. Thus, the equation 
applies only to cases where motion is impending with the friction force 
at its peak value. For a condition of static equilibrium when motion is 
not impending, the static friction force is 
Kinetic Friction 
After slippage occurs, a condition of kinetic friction accompanies the 
ensuing motion. Kinetic friction force is usually somewhat less than the 
maximum static friction force. The kinetic friction force Fk is also pro­
portional to the normal force. Thus, 
(612) 

where Jk1t is the coeficient of kinetic friction. It follows that p,,. is gener­
ally less than P-tt· As the velocity of the block increases, the kinetic fric­
tion decreases somewhat, and at high velocities, this decrease may be 
signillcant. Coefficients of friction depend greatly on the exact condition 
of the surfaces, as well as on the relative velocity, and are subject to con­
siderable uncertainty. 
Because of the variability of the conditions governing the action of 
friction, in engineering practice it is frequently difficult to distinguish 
between a static and a kinetic coefficient, especially in the region of 
transition between impending motion and motion. Well-greased screw 
threads under mild loads, for example, often exhibit comparable fric­
tional resistance whether they are on the verge of turning or whether 
they are in motion. 
In the engineering literature we frequently find expressions for max­
imum static friction and for kinetic friction written simply as F = pN. It 
is understood from the problem at hand whether maximum static fric­
tion or kinetic friction is described. Although we will frequently distin­
guish between the static and kinetic coefficients, in other cases no 
distinction will be made, and the friction coefficient will be written 
simply as p,. In those cases you must decide which of the friction condi­
tions, maximum static friction for impending motion or kinetic fric­
tion, is involved. We emphasize again that many problems involve a 
static friction force which is less than the maximum value at impend­
ing motion, and therefore under these conditions the friction relation 
Eq. 6/1 cannot be used. 
Figure 6/lc shows that rough surfaces are more likely to have 
larger angles between the reactions and the n-direction than 
are 
smoother surfaces. Thus, for a pair of mating surfaces, a friction coef­
ficient reflects the roughness, which is a geometric property of the 
surfaces. With this geometric model of friction, we describe mating 
surfaces as "smooth" when the friction forces they can support are 
negligibly small. It is meaningless to speak of a coefficient of friction 
for a single surface. 
Friction Angles 
The direction of the resultant R in Fig. 6/lb measured from the 
direction of N is specified by tan a 
= FIN. When the friction force 
reaches its limiting static value F max> the angle a reaches a maximum 
value c/>8• Thus, 
tan cf>. = p,8 
When slippage is occuring, the angle a has a value cf>k corresponding to 
the kinetic friction force. In like manner, 
In practice we often see the expression tan cf> 
= Jk, in which the

depending on the particular problem. The angle 4>s is called the angle of 
static friction, and the angle 4>k is called the angle of kinetic friction. The 
friction angle for each case clearly defines the limiting direction of the 
total reaction R between two contacting surfaces. If motion is impend­
ing, R must be one element of a right-circular cone of vertex angle 2¢8, 
as shown in Fig. 6/2. If motion is not impending, R is within the cone. 
This cone of vertex angle 24>. is called the cone of static friction and rep­
resents the locus of possible directions for the reaction Rat impending 
motion. If motion occurs, the angle of kinetic friction applies, and the 
reaction must lie on the surface of a slightly different cone of vertex 
angle 2f/J11• This cone is the cone of kinetic friction. 
Factors Affecting Friction 
Further experiment shows that the friction force is essentially in­
dependent of the apparent or projected area of contact. The true con­
tact area is much smaller than the projected value, since only the peaks 
of the contacting surface irregularities support the load. Even rela­
tively small normal loads result in high stresses at these contact points. 
As the normal force increases, the true contact area also increases as 
the material undergoes yielding, crushing, or tearing at the points of 
contact. 
A comprehensive theory of dry friction must go beyond the mechan­
ical explanation presented here. For example, there is evidence that 
molecular attraction may be an important cause of friction under condi­
tions where the mating surfaces are in very close contact. Other factors 
which influence dry friction are the generation of high local tempera­
tures and adhesion at contact points, relative hardness of mating sur­
faces, and the presence of thin surface films of oxide, oil, dirt, or other 
substances. 
Some typical values of coefficients of friction are given in Table D/1, 
Appendix D. These values are only approximate and are subject to con­
siderable variation, depending on the exact conditions prevailing. They 
may be used, however, as typical examples of the magnitudes of fric­
tional effects. To make a reliable calculation involving friction, the 
appropriate friction coefficient should be determined by experiments 
which duplicate the surface conditions of the application as closely as 
possible. 

TYPES OF FRICTION PROBLEMS 
We can now recognize the following three types of problems encoun­
tered in applications involving dry friction. The first step in solving a 
friction problem is to identify its type. 
1. In the first type of problem, the condition of impending motion is 
known to exist. Here a body which is in equilibrium is on the verge 
of slipping, and the friction force equals the limiting static friction 
F max 
= p.Jl. The equations of equilibrium will, of course, also hold. 
2. In the second type of problem, neither the condition of impending 
motion nor the condition of motion is known to exist. To determine 
the actual friction conditions, we first assume static equilibrium and 
then solve for the friction force F necessary for equilibrium. Three 
outcomes are possible: 
(a) F < (F maJ< = p./1): 
Here the 
friction force necessary for 
equilibrium can be supported, and therefore the body is in 
static equilibrium as assumed. We emphasize that the actual 
friction force F is less than the limiting value F max given by 
Eq. 6/1 and that F is determined solely by the equations of 
equilibrium. 
(b) F = (F ma:x = J.t/1): Since the friction force F is at its maximum 
value F maJ<> motion impends, as discussed in problem type (1). 
The assumption of static equilibrium is valid. 
(c) F > (F max = JL,/V): Clearly this condition is impossible, because 
the surfaces cannot support more force than the maximum J.t/1. 
The assumption of equilibrium is therefore invalid, and motion 
occurs. The friction force F is equal to J.tJ!V from Eq. 6/2. 
3. In the third type of problem, relative motion is known to exist 
between the contacting surfaces, and thus the kinetic coefficient of 
friction clearly applies. For this problem type, Eq. 6/2 always gives 
the kinetic friction force directly. 
The foregoing discussion applies to all dry contacting surfaces and, 
to a limited extent, to moving surfaces which are partially lubricated.

Solution. The free-body diagram of the block shows its weight W -= mg, the

Determine the range of values which the mass m0 may have so that the 100-kg 
block shown in the figure will neither start moving up the plane nor slip down 
the plane. The coefficient of static friction for the oontact surfaces is 0.30. 
Solution. The maximum value of m0 will be given by the requirement for mo­
tion impending up the plane. The friction force on the block therefore acts down 
the plane, as shown in the free-body diagram of the block for Case I in the figure.

Sample Problem 6/3 
Determine the magnitude and direction of the friction force ac:ting on the 
100-kg block shown if, first, P = 500 N and, second, P = 100 N. The coefficient of 
static friction is 0.20, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.17. The forces are 
applied with the block initially at rest. 
Solution. There is no way of telling from the statement of the problem whether 
the block will remain in equilibrium or whether it wil begin to slip following the 
application of P. It is therefore necessary that we make an assumption, so we will 
take the friction force to be up the plane, as shown by the solid arrow. From the 
fre-body diagram a balance of forces in both x- and y-direc:tions gives 
[kF.,"' 0] 
[kF1 = 0) 
Case/. P = 500 N 
P cos 20° + F - 981 sin 20° "' 0 
N - P sin 20° - 981 cos 20° = 0 
Substitution into the first of the two equations gives 
F = - 134.3N 
The negative sign tells us that if the block is in equilibrium, the friction force act­
ing on it is in the direction opposite to that assumed and therefore is down the 
plane, as represented by the dashed arrow. We cannot reach a conclusion on the 
magnitude ofF, however, until we verify that the surfaces are capable of sup­
porting 134.3 N of friction force. This may be done by substituting P "' 500 N 
into the second equation, which gives 
N= 1093N 
The maximum static friction force which the surfaces can support is then 
Fmu.x = 0.20(1093) = 219 N 
Since this force is greater than that required for equilibrium, we conclude that 
the assumption of equilibrium was correct. The answer is, then,

Sample Problem 6/4 
The homogeneous rectangular block of mass m, width b, and height H is 
placed on the horizontal surface and subjected to a horizontal force P which 
moves the block along the surface with a constant velocity. The coefficient of ki­
netic friction between the block and the surface is f.J.k· Determine (a) the great­
est value which h may have so that the block will slide without tipping over and 
(b) the location of a point C on the bottom face of the block through which the 
resultant of the friction and normal forces acts if h = H/2. 
Solution. (a) With the block on the verge of tipping, we see that the entire re­
action between the plane and the block will necessarily be at A. The free-body 
diagram of the block shows this condition. Since slipping occurs, the friction 
force is the limiting value f.J.,N, and the angle 8 becomes 8 = tan-1 f.J.Þo· The resul­
tant of FÞo and N passes through a point B through which P must also pass, since

Sample Problem 6/5 
The three flat blocks are positioned on the 30° incline as shown, and a force 
P parallel to the incline is applied to the middle block. The upper block is pre­
vented from moving by a wire which attaches it to the fixed support. The coeffi· 
cient of static friction for each of the three pairs of mating surfaces is shown. 
Determine the maximum value which P may have before any slipping takes 
place. 
Solution. The free-body diagram of each block is drawn. The friction forces 
are assigned in the directions to oppose the relative motion which would occur if 
(j) no friction were present. There are two possible conditions for impending mo­
tion. Either the 50-kg block slips and the 40-kg block remains in place, or the 50· 
and 40-kg blocks move together with slipping occurring between the 40-kg 
block and the incline. 
The normal forces, which are in they-direction, may be determined without 
r"6ference to the friction forces, which are all in the x-direction. Thus, 
[LFy = 0] 
(30-kg) 
N1 - 30(9.81) cos 30° = 0 
(50-kg) 
N2 - 50(9.81) cos 30° - 255 = 0 
(40-kg) 
N3- 40(9.81) cos 30° - 680 = 0 
N1 = 255N 
N2 = 680N 
N3 = 1019N 
We will assume arbitrarily that only the 50-kg block slips, so that the 40-kg 
block remains in place. Thus, for impending slippage at both surfaces of the 
50-kg block, we have 
F1"' 0.30(255) ,. 76.5 N 
F2 ,. 0.40(680) "' 272 N 
The assumed equilibrium of forces at impending motion for the 50-kg block 
gives 
[LF.,,. 0] 
P - 76.5 - 272 + 50(9.81) sin 30° ,. 0 
P,. 103.1N 
We now check on the validity of our initial assumption. For the 40-kg block 
with F2 ,. 272 N the friction force Fa would be given by 
[LF., = 0] 
272 + 40(9.81) sin 30°- F3"" 0 
F3"" 468 
But the maximum possible value of F3 is F3 = !L.Ns = 0.45(1019) = 459 N. Thus, 
468 N cannot be supported and our initial assumption was wrong. We conclude, 
therefore, that slipping occurs first between the 40-kg block and the incline. 
With the corrected value F3 = 459 N, equilibrium of the 40-kg block for its im· 
pending motion requires 
F2 + 40(9.81) sin 30° - 459 = 0

SECTION B APPLICATIONS OF FRICTION 
IN MACHINES 
In Section B we investigate the action of friction in various machine 
applications. Because the conditions in these applications are normally 
either limiting static or kinetic friction, we will use the variable 1-1-
(rather than !J.s or !J.It) in general. Depending on whether motion is im­
pending or actually ocurring, 1-1- can be interpreted as either the static 
or kinetic coefficient of friction. 
6/4 WEDG ES 
A wedge is one of the simplest and most useful machines. A wedge is 
used to produce small adjustments in the position of a body or to apply 
large forces. Wedges largely depend on friction to function. When sliding 
of a wedge is impending, the resultant force on each sliding surface of 
the wedge will be inclined from the normal to the surface by an amount 
equal to the friction angle. The component of the resultant along the 
surface is the friction force, which is always in the direction to oppose 
the motion of the wedge relative to the mating surfaces. 
Figure 6/3a shows a wedge used to position or lift a large mass m, 
where the vertical loading is mg. The coefficient of friction for each pair 
of surfaces is !J. = tan cp. The force P required to start the wedge is found 
from the equilibrium triangles of the forces on the load and on the 
wedge. The free-body diagrams are shown in Fig. 613b, where the reac­
tions are inclined at an angle cp from their respective normals and are in 
the direction to oppose the motion. We neglect the mass of the wedge. 
From the free-body diagrams we write the force equilibrium conditions 
by equating to zero the sum of the force vectors acting on each body. 
The solutions of these equations are shown in part c of the figure, where 
R2 is found first in the upper diagram using the known value of mg. The 
force P is then found from the lower triangle once the value of R2 has 
been established. 
If P is removed and the wedge remains in place, equilibrium of the 
wedge requires that the equal reactions R1 and R2 be collinear as 
shown in Fig. 6/4, where the wedge angle a is taken to be less than cp. Ra 
Part a of the figure represents impending slippage at the upper surface, 
and part c of the figure represents impending slippage at the lower sur­
face. In order for the wedge to slide out of its space, slippage must occur 
at both surfaces simultaneously; otherwise, the wedge is self-locking, 
and there is a finite range of possible intermediate angular positions of 
R1 and R2 for which the wedge will remain in place. Figure 6/4b illus­
trates this range and shows that simultaneous slippage is not possible 
if a < 2cp. You are encouraged to construct additional diagrams for 
the case where a > cp and verifY that the wedge is self-locking as long 
as a <  2cp. 
If the wedge is self-locking and is to be withdrawn, a pull P on the 
wedge will be required. To oppose the new impending motion, the reac­
tions R1 and R2 must act on the opposite sides of their normals from 
those when the wedge was inserted. The solution can be obtained as

within tolerances consistent with the uncertainty of friction coefficients. 
Algebraic solutions may also be obtained from the trigonometry of the

Screws are used for fastening and for transmitting power or motion. 
In each case the friction developed in the threads largely determines the 
action of the screw. For transmitting power or motion the square thread 
is more efficient than the V-thread, and the analysis here is confined to 
the square thread. 

Force Analysis 
Consider the square-threaded jack, Fig. 6/6, under the action of the 
axial load W and a moment M applied about the axis of the screw. The 
screw has a lead L (advancement per revolution) and a mean radius r. 
The force R exerted by the thread of the jack frame on a small represen­
tative portion of the screw thread is shown on the free-body diagram of 
the screw. Similar reactions exist on all segments of the screw thread 
where contact occurs with the thread of the base. 
If M is just sufficient to turn the screw, the thread of the screw 
will slide around and up on the fixed thread of the frame. The angle 4> 
made by R with the normal to the thread is the angle of friction, so that 
tan 4> = lk· The moment of R about the vertical axis of the screw is 
Rr sin (a + rf>), and the total moment due to all reactions on the threads 
is 'LRr sin (a + rj>). Since r sin (a + rf>) appears in each term, we may fac­
tor it out. The moment equilibrium equation for the screw becomes 
M = [r sin (a + rj>)) 'LR 
Equilibrium of forces in the axial direction further requires that 
W = 'LR cos (a + </J) = [cos (a + rf>)] 'LR 
Combining the expressions for M and W gives 
M = Wr tan (a + rf>) 
(613) 
To determine the helix angle a, unwrap the thread of the screw for one 
complete turn and note that a =  tan- 1 (L/27TT'). 
We may use the unwrapped thread of the screw as an alternative 
model to simulate the action of the entire screw, as shown in Fig. 617a. 
The equivalent force required to push the movable thread up the fixed 
incline is P = Mlr, and the triangle of force vectors gives Eq. 6/3 
immediately.

Conditions for Unwinding 
If the moment M is removed, the friction force changes direction so 
that cp is measured to the other side of the normal to the thread. The 
screw will remain in place and be self-locking provided that a < cp, and 
will be on the verge of unwinding if a = cp. 
To lower the load by unwinding the screw, we must reverse the di­
rection of M as long as a < cp. This condition is illustrated in Fig. 6/7b 
for our simulated thread on the fixed incline. An equivalent force P = 
Mlr must be applied to the thread to pull it down the incline. From the 
triangle of vectors we therefore obtain the moment required to lower 
the screw, which is 
M = Wr tan (cp - a) 
(613a) 
If a > cp, the screw wil unwind by itself, and Fig. 6/7c shows that 
the moment required to prevent unwinding is 
M = Wr tan (a - cp)

Sample Problem 6/6 
The horizontal position of the 500-kg rectangular block of concrete is ad­
justed by the 5° wedge under the action of the force P. If the coefficient of static 
friction for both wedge surfaces is 0.30 and if the coefficient of static friction 
between the block and the horizontal surface is 0.60, determine the least force P 
required to move the block. 
Solution. The free-body diagrams of the wedge and the block are drawn with 
the reactions Rv Â. and R3 inclined with respect to their normals by the 
CD amount of the friction angles for impending motion. The friction angle for limit­
ing static friction is given by tjJ = tan -1 JJ.·. Each of the two friction angles is com­
puted and shown on the diagram. 
We start our vector diagram expressing the equilibrium of the block at a 
convenient point A and draw the only known vector, the weight W of the block. 
Next we add Ra. whose 31.0° inclination from the vertical is now known. The 
vector -Â. whose 16.70° inclination from the horizontal is also known, must 
close the polygon for equilibrium. Thus, point B on the lower polygon is deter­
mined by the intersection of the known directions ofR3 and -Ã and their mag­
nitudes become known. 
For the wedge we draw Â. which is now known, and add Rl> whose direc­
tion is known. The directions ofR1 and P intersect at C, thus giving us the solu· 
tion for the magnitude of P. 
Algebraic solution. The simplest choice of reference axes for calculation 
purposes is, for the block, in the direction a-a normal to Rs and, for the wedge, in 
® the direction b-b normal to R1. The angle between Â and the a-direction is 
16.70° + 31.0° =- 47.7°. Thus, for the block 
[!.F" = OJ 
500(9.81) sin 31 .0° - R2 cos 47. 7" = 0 
R2 = 3750 N 
For the wedge the angle between Â and the b-direction is 90° - (2tjJ1 + 
5°) = 51 .6°, and the angle between P and the b-direction is tjJ1 + 5o = 21.7°. Thus, 
[ĻFo = 0) 
3750 cos 51.6" - p cos 21.7° = 0 
P = 2500 N 
Ans. 
Graphical solution. The accuracy of a graphical solution is well within the 
uncertainty of the friction coefficients and provides a simple and direct result. By 
laying off the vectors to a reasonable scale following the sequence described, we 
obtain the magnitudes of P and the R's easily by scaling them directly from the 
diagrams.

wise direction as seen from the front of the vise. The frictional moment M8 due 
to the friction forces acting on the collar at B is in the counterclockwise direction 
to oppose the impending motion. From Eq. 613 with T substituted for W, the net 
moment acting on the screw is 
M = Tr tan (a + c/J)

M8 = 33.3 N · m  acting in the clockwise direction to oppose the motion. The angle 
between R and the screw axis is now cjJ - a, and we use Eq. 6/3a with the net 
moment equal to the applied moment M' minus M B· Thus 
M = Tr tan (cjJ - a) 
M' - 33.3 = 8000(0.0125) tan ( 1 1 .31° - 3.64°)

Ajournal bearing is one which gives lateral support to a shaft in 
contrast to axial or thrust support. For dry bearings and for many 
partially lubricated bearings we may apply the principles of dry fric­
tion. These principles provide a satisfactory approximation for design 
purposes. 
A dry or partially lubricated journal bearing with contact or near 
contact between the shaft and the bearing is shown in Fig. 6/8, where 
the clearance between the shaft and bearing is greatly exaggerated to 
clarify the action. As the shaft begins to turn in the direction shown, it 
will roll up the inner surface of the bearing until it slips. Here it will re­
main in a more or less fixed position during rotation. The torque M re­
quired to maintain rotation and the radial load L on the shaft will cause 
Figure 6/8 
a reaction R at the contact point A. For vertical equilibrium R must 
equal L but will not be collinear with it. Thus, R will be tangent to a 
small circle of radius r1 called the friction circle. The angle between R 
and its normal component N is the friction angle ,P. Equating the sum of 
the moments about A to zero gives 
M = Lrf = Lr sin <P 
(6/4) 
For a small coefficient of friction, the angle ,P is small, and the 
sine and tangent may be interchanged with only small error. Since J.L = 
tan </J, a good approximation to the torque is 
M = J.LLr 
(614a) 
This relation gives the amount of torque or moment which must be ap­
plied to the shaft to overcome friction for a dry or partially lubricated 
journal bearing.

Friction between circular surfaces under distributed normal pres­
sure occurs in pivot bearings, clutch plates, and disk brakes. To examine 
these applications, we consider the two flat circular disks shown in Fig. 
6/9. Their shafts are mounted in bearings (not shown) so that they can 
be brought into contact under the axial force P. The maximum torque 
which this clutch can transmit is equal to the torque M required to slip 
one disk against the other. If p is the normal pressure at any location 
between the plates, the frictional force acting on an elemental area is 
J.LP dA, where J.L is the friction coefficient and dA is the area r dr dO of 
the element. The moment of this elemental friction force about the shaft 
axis is WJr dA, and the total moment becomes 
M = J p.pr dA 
where we evaluate the integral over the area of the disk. To carry out 
this integration, we must know the variation of J.L and p with r. 
Figure 619 
In the following examples we will assume that J.L is constant. Fur­
thermore, if the surfaces are new, flat, and well supported, it is reason­
able to assume that the pressure p is uniform over the entire surface so 
that 1rR2p = P. Substituting the constant value of p in the expression 
for M gives

We may interpret this result as equivalent to the moment due to a fric­
tion force j1i> acting at a distance iR from the shaft center. 
If the friction disks are rings, as in the collar bearing shown in 
Fig. 6/10, the limits of integration are the inside and outside radii Rt 
and R01 respectively, and the frictional torque becomes 
(615a) 
After the initial wearin.g-in period is over, the surfaces retain their 
new relative shape, and further wear is therefore constant over the sur­
face. This wear depends on both the circumferential distance traveled

expression rp

is determined from the equilibrium condition for the axial forces, which 
gives 
P = f p dA = K f"" foR dr d(J = 27r.KR 
With pr = K = P/(27rR), we may write the expression for M  as 
which becomes

The frictional moment for worn-in plates is, therefore, only <l)t(i), or  
as much as for new surfaces. If the friction disks are rings of inside ra­
dius R; and outside radius R0, substitution of these limits gives for the 
frictional torque for worn-in surfaces 
(616a) 
You should be prepared to deal with other disk-friction problems 
where the pressure p is some other function of r.

The bell crank fits over a 100-mm-diameter shaft which is fixed and cannot 
rotate. The horizontal force T is applied to maintain equilibrium of the crank 
under the action of the vertical force P = 100 N. Determine the maximum and 
minimum values which T may have without causing the crank to rotate in either 
direction. The coefficient of static friction p. between the shaft and the bearing 
surface of the crank is 0.20. 
Solution. Impending rotation occurs when the reaction R of the fixed shaft on 
the bell crank makes an angle q, = tan-1 p, with the normal to the bearing sur­
face and is, therefore, tangent to the friction circle. Also, equilibrium requires 
that the three forces acting on the crank be concurrent at point C. These facts 
are shown in the free-body diagrams for the two cases of impending motion.

The impending slippage of flexible cables, belts, and ropes over 
sheaves and drums is important in the design of belt drives of all types, 
band brakes, and hoisting rigs. 
Figure 6/lla shows a drum subjected to the two belt tensions T1 
and T2, the torque M necessary to prevent rotation, and a bearing reac­
tion R. With M in  the direction shown, T2 is greater than T1• The free-body 
diagram of an element of the belt of length r d8 is shown in part b 
of the figure. We analyze the forces acting on this differential element 
by establishing the equilibrium of the element, in a manner similar to 
that used for other variable-force problems. The tension increases from 
T at the angle 9 to T + dT at the angle 8 + d9. The normal force is a dif­
ferential dN, since it acts on a differential element of area. Likewise the 
friction force, which must act on the belt in a direction to oppose slip­
ping, is a differential and is 11- dN for impending motion. 
Equilibrium in the t-direction gives 
or 
$.t dN = dT 
since the cosine of a differential quantity is unity in the limit. Equilib­
rium in the n-direction requires that 
dN = (T + dT) sin
d: + T sin 2

or 
dN = T d9 
where we have used the facts that the sine of a differential angle in the 
limit equals the angle and that the product of two differentials must be 
neglected in the limit compared with the first-order differentials re­
maining. 
Combining the two equilibrium relations gives 
Integrating between corresponding limits yields

Note that {3 is the total angle of belt contact and must be expressed in 
radians. If a rope were wrapped around a drum n times, the angle (J 
would be 21rn radians. Equation 6/7 holds equally well for a noncircular 
section where the total angle of contact is {3. This conclusion is evident 
from the fact that the radius r of the circular drum in Fig. 6/11 does not 
enter into the equations for the equilibrium of the differential element 
of the belt. 
The relation expressed by Eq. 6/7 also applies to belt drives where 
both the belt and the pulley are rotating at constant speed. In this case 
the equation describes the ratio of belt tensions for slippage or impend­
ing slippage. When the speed of rotation becomes large, the belt tends 
to leave the rim, so Eq. 6/7 involves some error in this case. 
6/9 
ROLLING RESISTA NCE 
Deformation at the point of contact between a rolling wheel and its 
supporting surface introduces a resistance to rolling, which we mention 
only briefly. This resistance is not due to tangential friction forces and 
therefore is an entirely different phenomenon from that of dry friction. 
To describe rolling resistance, we consider the wheel shown in Fig. 6/12 
under the action of a load L on the axle and a force P applied at its 
center to produce rolling. The deformation of the wheel and supporting 
surfaces as shown is greatly exaggerated. The distribution of pressure p 
over the area of contact is similar to the distribution shown. The resul­
tant R of this distribution acts at some point A and must pass through 
the wheel center for the wheel to be in equilibrium. We find the force P 
necessary to maintain rolling at constant speed by equating the mo­
ments of all forces about A to zero. This gives us 
a 
P = - L = " L 
r 
r-r 
where the moment arm of P is taken to be r. The ratio P.r = air is 
called the coefficient of rolling resistance. This coefficient is the ratio of 
resisting force to normal force and thus is analogous to the coefficient 
of static or kinetic friction. On the other hand, there is no slippage or 
impending slippage in the interpretation of P.r· 
Because the dimension a depends on many factors which are diffi­
cult to quantify, a comprehensive theory of rolling resistance is not 
available. The distance a is a function of the elastic and plastic proper­
ties of the mating materials, the radius of the wheel, the speed of travel, 
and the roughness of the surfaces. Some tests indicate that a varies only 
slightly with wheel radius, and thus a is often taken to be independent 
of the rolling radius. Unfortunately, the quantity a has also been called 
the coefficient of rolling friction in some references. However, a has the 
dimension of length and therefore is not a dimensionless coefficient in 
the usual sense.

Eq. 617, the radius of the drum does

Sample Problem 6/ 1 0  
Determine the range of mass m over which the system is in static 
equilibrium. The coefficient of static friction between the cord and the 
upper curved surface is 0.20, while that between the block and the incline 
is 0.40. Neglect friction at the pivot 0. 
Solution. From the FBD of the uniform slender bar, we can determine 
the tension TA in the cable at point A. 
[kMo = OJ 
- TA (0 cos 35") + 9(9.81 )  (1cos 25°) = 0 
TA = 73.3 N 
I. Motion of m impends up the incline. 
The tension TA = 73.3 N is the larger of the two tensions associated 
with the rough rounded surface. From Eq. 6fl we have 
T1 = 57.4 N 
From the FBD of the block for Case 1: 
N - mg cos 40° = 0 
N =  0.766mg 
[L.Fy = 0] 
[L.F,. = 0] 
-57.4 + mg sin 40° + 0.40(0.766mg) = 0 
mg = 60.5 N 
m = 6.16 kg 
II. Motion of m impends down the incline. 
The value TA = 73.3 N is unchanged, but now this is the smaller of 
the two tensions in Eq. 6!7. 
r2 = 73.3e0.20[30'+40'hrl80' 
T2 = 93.5 N 
Considering the FBD of the block for Case TI, we see that the normal 
force N is unchanged from Case I. 
-93.5 - 0.4(0.766mg) + mg sin 40" = 0 
mg = 278 N 
m = 28.3 kg 
So the requested range is 6.16 s m s 28.3 kg.

6/ 1 0  CH APTER REVIEW 
I n  our study of friction we have concentrated o n  dry or Coulomb friction 
where a simple mechanical model of surface irregularities between the 
contacting bodies, Fig. 6/1, explains the phenomenon adequately for most 
engineering purposes. This model helps to visualize the three types of dry­
friction problems which are encountered in practice. These problem types are: 
1. Static friction of less than the maximum possible value and determined 
by the equations of equilibrium. (This usually requires a check to see that 
F < JL.N.) 
2. Limiting static friction with impending motion (F = JL8N). 
3. Kinetic friction where sliding motion occurs between contacting surfaces 
(F = JL&tM· 
Keep in mind the following when solving dry-friction problems: 
1. A coefficient of friction applies to a given pair of mating surfaces. It is 
meaningless to speak of a coefficient of friction for a single surface. 
2. The coefficient of static friction 11-s for a given pair of surfaces is usually 
slightly greater than the kinetic coefficient ILk· 
3. The friction force which acts on a body is always in the direction to oppose 
the slipping of the body which takes place or the slipping which would 
take place in the absence of friction. 
4. When friction forces are distributed over a surface or along a line, we 
select a representative element of the surface or line and evaluate the force 
and moment effects of the elemental friction force acting on the element. 
We then integrate these effects over the entire surface or line. 
5. Friction coefficients vary considerably, depending on the exact condition of 
the mating surfaces. Computing coefficients of friction to three significant 
figures represents an accuracy which cannot easily be duplicated by 
experiment. When cited, such values are included for purposes of computa­
tional check only. For design computations in engineering practice, any 
handbook value for a coefficient of static or kinetic friction must be viewed 
as an approximation. 
Other forms of friction mentioned in the introductory article of the chapter 
are important in engineering. Problems which involve fluid friction, for 
example, are among the most important of the friction problems encountered 
in engineering and are studied in the subject of fiuid mechanics.

INTRODUCTION 
In the previous chapters we have analyzed the equilibrium of a 
body by isolating it with a free-body diagram and writing the zero-force 
and zero-moment summation equations. This approach is usually 
employed for a body whose equilibrium position is known or specified 
and where one or more of the external forces is an unknown to be 
determined. 
There is a separate class of problems in which bodies are composed 
of interconnected members which can move relative to each other. Thus 
various equilibrium configurations are possible and must be examined. 
For problems of this type, the force- and moment-equilibrium equations, 
although valid and adequate, are often not the most direct and conve­
nient approach. 
A method based on the concept of the work done by a force is 
more direct. Also, the method provides a deeper insight into the be­
havior of mechanical systems and enables us to examine the stability 
of systems in equilibrium. This method is called the method of virtual 
work.

We must first define the term work in its quantitative sense, in con­
trast to its common nontechnical usage.

Work of a Force 
Consider the constant force F acting on the body shown in Fig. 7/la, 
whose movement along the plane from A to A' is represented by the vec­
tor lls, called the displacement of the body. By definition the work U 
done by the force F on the body during this displacement is the compo­
nent of the force in the direction of the displacement times the displace­
ment, or 
U = (F cos a) lls 
From Fig. 7/lb we see that the same result is obtained if we multiply the 
magnitude of the force by the component of the displacement in the di­
rection of the force. This gives 
U = F(lls cos a) 
Because we obtain the same result regardless of the direction in which 
we resolve the vectors, we conclude that work U is a scalar quantity. 
Work is positive when the working component of the force is in the 
same direction as the displacement. When the working component is in 
the direction opposite to the displacement, Fig. 7/2, the work done is 
negative. Thus, 
U = (F cos a) lls = -(F cos 0) lls 
We now generalize the definition of work to account for conditions 
under which the direction of the displacement and the magnitude and 
direction of the force are variable. 
Figure 7/3a shows a force F acting on a body at a point A which 
moves along the path shown from A 1 to A2• Point A is located by its posi­
tion vector r measured from some arbitrary but convenient origin 0. 
The infinitesimal displacement in the motion from A to A' is given by 
the differential change dr of the position vector. The work done by the 
force F during the displacement dr is defined as 
( dU = F· dr) 
(711) 
IfF denotes the magnitude of the force F and ds denotes the magnitude 
of the differential displacement dr, we use the definition of the dot prod­
uct to obtain 
dU = F ds cos a 
We may again interpret this expression as the force component F cos a 
in the direction of the displacement times the displacement, or as the 
displacement component ds cos a in the direction of the force times the 

force, as represented in Fig. 7/3b. If we express F and dr in terms of 
their rectangular components, we have 
dU = (iF., + jFY + kFz ) • (i dx + j dy + k dz) 
= Fx dx + Fy dy + Fz dz 
To obtain the total work U done by F during a finite movement of 
point A from A1 to A2, Fig. 7/3a, we integrate dU between these posi­
tions. Thus, 
U = J F·dr = J W. dx + Fydy + F,.dz) 
or 
U= J Fcosads 
To carry out this integration, we must know the relation between the 
force compon.ents and their respective coordinates, or the relations be­
tween F and s and between cos a and s. 
In the case of concurrent forces which are applied at any particular 
point on a body, the work done by their resultant equals the total work 
done by the several forces. This is because the component of the resul­
tant in the direction of the displacement equals the sum of the compo­
nents of the several forces in the same direction. 
Work of a Couple 
In addition to the work done by forces, couples also can do work. In 
Fig. 7/4a the couple M acts on the body and changes its angular position 
by an amount dO. The work done by the couple is easily determined from 
the combined work of the two forces which constitute the couple. In part 
b of the figure we represent the couple by two equal and opposite forces F 
and -F acting at two arbitrary points A and B such that F = Mlb. Dur­
ing the infinitesimal movement in the plane of the figure, line AB moves 
to A"B'. We now take the displacement of A in two steps, first, a displace­
ment dr8 equal to that of B and, second, a displacement drNB (read as 
the displacement of A with respect to B) due to the rotation about B. 
Thus the work done by F during the displacement from A to A' is equal 
and opposite in sign to that due to -F acting through the equal displace­
ment from B to B'. We therefore conclude that no work is done by a cou­
ple during a translation (movement without rotation). 
During the rotation, however, F does work equal to F·drAJB 
= 
Fb d8, where drNB = b d() and where dO is the infinitesimal angle of ro­
tation in radians. Since M = Fb, we have

394 Chapter 7 Virtual Work 
The work of the couple is positive if M has the same sense as d8 (clock­
wise in this illustration), and negative if M has a sense opposite to that 
of the rotation. The total work of a couple during a finite rotation in its 
plane becomes 
U = J M dO 
Dimensions ofWor1< 
Work has the dimensions of(force) X (distance). In SI units the unit 
of work is the joule (J), which is the work done by a force of one newton 
moving through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force 
(J 
= N ·m). In the U.S. customary system the unit of work is the foot­
pound (ft-lb), which is the work done by a one-pound force moving 
through a distance of one foot in the direction of the force. 
The dimensions of the work of a force and the moment of a force are 
the same, although they are entirely different physical quantities. Note 
that work is a scalar given by the dot product and thus involves the 
product of a force and a distance, both measured along the same line. 
Moment, on the other hand, is a vector given by the cross product and 
involves the product of force and distance measured at right angles to 
the force. To distinguish between these two quantities when we write 
their units, in SI units we use the joule (J) for work and reserve the 
combined units newton-meter (N·m) for moment. In the U.S. custom­
ary system we normally use the sequence foot-pound (ft-lb) for work 
and pound-foot (lb-ft) for moment. 
Virtual Work 
We consider now a particle whose static equilibrium position is de­
termined by the forces which act on it. Any assumed and arbitrary small 
displacement ()r away from this natural position and consistent with the 
system constraints is called a virtual displacement. The term virtual is 
used to indicate that the displacement does not really exist but only is 
assumed to exist, so that we may compare various possible equilibrium 
positions to determine the correct one. 
The work done by any force F acting on the particle during the vir­
tual displacement 8r is called virtual work and is 
8U = F·8r 
or 
8U = F 8s cos a 
where a is the angle betwee.n F and &, and 8s is the magnitude of 8r. 
The difference between dr and 8r is that dr refers to an actual infinites­
imal change in position and can be integrated, whereas 8r refers to an 
infinitesimal virtual or assumed movement and cannot be integrated. 
Mathematically both quantities are first-order differentials. 
A virtual displacement may also be a rotation 89 of a body. Accord­
ing to Eq. 7/2 the virtual work done by a couple M during a virtual an­
gular displacement 88 is 8U = M 88. 
We may regard the force F or couple M as remaining constant 
during any infinitesimal virtual displacement. If we ac.count for any 

change in F or M during the infinitesimal motion, higher-order terms 
will result which disappear in the limit. This consideration is the 
same mathematically as that which permits us to neglect the product 
dx dy when writing dA = y dx for the element of area under the curve 
y = f(x). 
7/3 
EQUI L I B R IUM 
We now express the equilibrium conditions in terms of virtual work, 
first for a particle, then for a single rigid body, and then for a system of 
connected rigid bodies. 
Equilibrium of a Particle 
Consider the particle or small body in Fig. 7/5 which attains an 
equilibrium position as a result of the forces in the attached springs. If 
the mass of the particle were significant, then the weight mg would also 
be included as one of the forces. For an assumed virtual displacement Br 
of the particle away from its equilibrium position, the total virtual work 
done on the particle is 
We now express  F in terms of its scalar sums and Br in terms of 
its component virtual displacements in the coordinate directions, as 
follows: 
5U =  F·ar = (i  Fx + j  Fy + k  Fz ) • (i ax +jay + k az ) 
=  Fx ax+  Fy ay +  Fz az = 0 
The sum is zero, since  F 
= 0, which gives "2.Fx 
= 0,  F, 
= 0, and 
 Fz == 0. The equation au == 0 is therefore an alternative statement of 
the equilibrium conditions for a particle. This condition of zero virtual 
work for equilibrium is both necessary and sufficient, since we may 
apply it to virtual displacements taken one at a time in each of the three 
mutually perpendicular directions, in which case it becomes equivalent 
to the three known scalar requirements for equilibrium. 
The principle of zero virtual work for the equilibrium of a single 
particle usually does not simplifY this already simple problem because 
au = 0 and  F = 0 provide the same information. However, we intro­
duce the concept of virtual work for a particle so that we can later apply 
it to systems of particles. 
Equilibrium of a Rigid Body 
We can easily extend the principle of virtual work for a single parti­
cle to a rigid body treated as a system of small elements or particles 
rigidly attached to one another. Because the virtual work done on each 
particle of the body in equilibrium is zero, it follows that the virtual 
work done on the entire rigid body is zero. Only the virtual work done 
by external forces appears in the evaluation of au 
= 0 for the entire

body, since all internal forces occur in pairs of equal, opposite, and 
collinear forces, and the net work done by these forces during any move­
ment is zero. 
As in the case of a particle, we again find that the principle of vir­
tual work offers no particular advantage to the solution for a single rigid 
body in equilibrium. Any assumed virtual displacement defined by a lin­
ear or angular movement will appear in each term in fiU = 0 and when 
canceled will leave us with the same expression we would have obtained 
by using one of the force or moment equations of equilibrium directly. 
This condition is illustrated in Fig. 7/6, where we want to determine 
the reaction R under the roller for the hinged plate of negligible weight 
under the action of a given force P. A small assumed rotation 89 of the 
plate about 0 is consistent with the hinge constraint at 0 and is taken 
as the virtual displacement. The work done by P is -Pa l59, and the 
work done by R is + Rb 58. Therefore, the principle 8U = 0 gives 
-Pa 59 + Rb l58 = 0 
Canceling 56 leaves 
Pa - Rb = 0 
which is simply the equation of moment equilibrium about 0. There­
fore, nothing is gained by using the virtual-work principle for a single 
rigid body. The principle is, however, decidedly advantageous for inter­
connected bodies, as discussed next. 
Equilibrium of Ideal Systems of Rigid Bodies 
We now extend the principle of virtual work to the equilibrium of an 
interconnected system of rigid bodies. Our treatment here will be lim­
ited to so-called ideal systems. These are systems composed of two or 
more rigid members linked together by mechanical connections which 
are incapable of absorbing energy through elongation or compression, 
and in which friction is small enough to be neglected. 
Figure 717a shows a simple example of an ideal system where rela­
tive motion between its two parts is possible and where the equilibrium 
position is determined by the applied external forces P and F. We can 
identify three types of forces which act in such an interconnected sys­
tem. They are as follows: 
( 1) Active forces are external forces capable of doing virtual work 
during possible virtual displacements. In Fig. 7/7a forces P and Fare 
active forces because they would do work as the links move. 
(2) Reactive forces are forces which act at fixed support positions 
where no virtual displacement takes place in the direction of the force. 
Reactive forces do no work during a virtual displacement. In Fig. 717b 
the horizontal force F B exerted on the roller end of the member by the 
vertical guide can do no work because there can be no horizontal dis­
placement of the roller. The reactive force F 0 exerted on the system by 
the fixed support at 0 also does no work because 0 cannot move. 

(3) Internal forces are forces in the connections between members. 
During any possible movement of the system or its parts, the net work 
done by the internal forces at the connections is zero. This is so because 
the internal forces always exist in pairs of equal and opposite forces, as 
indicated for the internal forces FA and -FA atjointA in Fig. 717c. The 
work of one force therefore necessarily cancels the work of the other 
force during their identical displacements. 
Principle of Virtual Work 
Noting that only the external active forces do work during any pos­
sible movement of the system, we may now state the principle of vir­
tual work as follows: 
The virtual work done by external active forces on an ideal 
mechanical system in equilibrium is zero for any and all 
virtual displacements consistent with the constraints. 
By constraint we mean restriction of the motion by the supports. We 
state the principle mathematically by the equation 
(7/8) 
where 8U stands for the total virtual work done on the system by all ac­
tive forces during a virtual displacement. 
Only now can we see the real advantages of the method of virtual 
work. There are essentially two. First, it is not necessary for us to dis­
member ideal systems in order to establish the relations between the 
active forces, as is generally the case with the equilibrium method 
based on force and moment summations. Second, we may determine 
the relations between the active forces directly without reference to the 
reactive forces. These advantages make the method of virtual work par­
ticularly useful in determining the position of equilibrium of a system 
under known loads. This type of problem is in contrast to the problem 
of determining the forces acting on a body whose equilibrium position 
is known. 
The method of virtual work is especially useful for the purposes 
mentioned but requires that the internal friction forces do negligible 
work during any virtual displacement. Consequently, if internal friction 
in a mechanical system is appreciable, the method of virtual work can­
not be used for the system as a whole unless the work done by internal 
friction is included. 
When using the method of virtual work, you should draw a diagram 
which isolates the system under consideration. Unlike the free-body dia­
gram, where all forces are shown, the diagram for the method of virtual 
work need show only the active forces, since the reactive forces do not 
enter into the application of 8U = 0. Such a drawing will be termed an 
active-force diagram. Figure 717a is an active-force diagram for the sys­
tem shown.

Degrees of Freedom 
The number of degres of freedom of a mechanical system is the 
number of independent coordinates needed to specify completely the 
configuration of the system. Figure 7 /Sa shows three examples of one­
degree-of-freedom systems. Only one coordinate is needed to establish 
the position of every part of the system. The coordinate can be a dis­
tance or an angle. Figure 7/Bb shows three examples of two-degree-of­
freedom systems where two independent coordinates are needed to 
determine the configuration of the system. By the addition of more links 
to the mechanism in the right-hand figure, there is no limit to the num­
ber of degrees of freedom which can be introduced. 
The principle of virtual work 8U = 0 may be applied as many times 
as there are degrees of freedom. With each application, we allow only 
one independent cordinate to change at a time while holding the others 
constant. In our treatment of virtual work in this chapter, we consider 
only one-degree-of-freedom systems.* 
Systems with Friction 
When sliding friction is present to any appreciable degree in a me­
chanical system, the system is said to be "real." In real systems some of 
the positive work done on the system by external active forces (input 
work) is dissipated in the form of heat generated by the kinetic friction 
forces during movement of the system. When there is sliding between 
contacting surfaces, the friction force does negative work because its di­
rection is always opposite to the movement of the body on which it acts. 
This negative work cannot be regained. 
Thus, the kinetic friction force JLJ!V acting on the sliding block in 
Fig. 7/9a does work on the block during the displacement x in the 
amount of -JLJ!Vx. During a virtual displacement 8x, the friction force 
does work equal to 
-f.LJ!V 8x. The static friction force acting on the

the first author's Statics, 2nd Edition, 1971, or SI Version, 1975. 

rolling wheel in Fig. 7/9b, on the other hand, does no work if the 
wheel does not slip as it rolls. 
In Fig. 7/9c the moment M1 about the center of the pinned joint due 
to the friction forces which act at the contacting surfaces does negative 
work during any relative angular movement between the two parts. 
Thus, for a virtual displacement 5 0  between the two parts, which have 
the separate virtual displacements 801 and 802 as shown, the negative 
work done is -M 1 801 -M1 882 = -M1(581 + 802), or simply -M 1 80. For 
each part, M 1 is in the sense to oppose the relative motion of rotation. 
It was noted earlier in the article that a major advantage of the 
method of virtual work is in the analysis of an entire system of con­
nected members without taking them apart. If there is appreciable ki­
netic friction internal to the system, it becomes necessary to dismember 
the system to determine the friction forces. In such cases the method of 
virtual work finds only limited use. 
Mechanical Efficiency 
Because of energy loss due to friction, the output work of a machine 
is always less than the input work. The ratio of the two amounts of 
work is the mechanical efficiency e. Thus, 
output work 
e= 
input work 
The mechanical efficiency of simple machines which have a single de­
gree of freedom and which operate in a uniform manner may be deter­
mined by the method of work by evaluating the numerator and 
denominator of the expression fore during a virtual displacement. 
As an example, consider the block being moved up the inclined 
plane in Fig. 7/10. For the virtual displacement 8s shown, the output 
work is that necessary to elevate the block, or mg 5 s sin 0. The input 
work is T & = (mg sin 9 + J.LJinC cos 9) 8s. The efficiency of the inclined 
plane is, therefore, 
mg 8s sin8 
1 
e= 
= 
mg(sin 0 + J.Lk cos 0) 8s 
1 + J.Lk cot 0 
As a second example, consider the screw jack described in Art. 6/5 
and shown in Fig. 6/6. Equation 6/3 gives the moment M required to 
raise the load W, where the screw has a mean radius r and a helix angle 
a, and where the friction angle is 4> = tan-• J.Lk· During a small rotation 
88 of the screw, the input work isM 5 0= Wr 88 tan (a + cp). The output 
work is that required to elevate the load, or Wr 58 tan a. Thus the effi­
ciency of the jack can be expressed as 
Wr 5 0 tan a

As friction is decreased, c/J becomes smaller, and the efficiency ap­
proaches unity.

Solution. The active-force diagram for the system composed of the two mem­
bers is shown separately and includes the weight mg of each bar in addition to 
the force P. Al other forces acting externally on the system are reactive forces 
which do no work during a virtual movement 8x and are therefore not shown. 
The principle of virtual work requires that the total work of all external ac­
tive forces be zero for any virtual displacement consistent with the constraints. 
Thus, for a movement 8x the virtual work becomes

Helpful Hints

to the right 8x is also positive to the 
right in the direction of P, so that the 
virtual work is P(-+ Bx). With h posi­
tive down Bh is also mathematically 
positive down in the direction of mg, 
so that the correct mathematical 
expression for the work is mg( +8h). 
When we express Bh in terms of 88 in 
the next step, Bh wil have a negative 
sign, thus bringing our mathematical 
expression into agreement with the 
physical observation that the weight 
mg does negative work as each center 
of mass moves upward with an in­
crease in x and 0.

Sample Problem 7/2 
The mass m is brought to an equilibrium position by the application of the 
couple M to the end of one of the two parallel links which are hinged as shown. 
The links have negligible mass, and all friction is assumed to be absent. Deter­
mine the expression for the equilibrium angle(} assumed by the links with the 
vertical for a given value of M. Consider the alternative of a solution by force and 
moment equilibrium. 
Solution. The active-force diagram shows the weight mg acting through the 
center of mass G and the couple M applied to the end of the link. There are no 
other external active forces or moments which do work on the system during a 
change in the angle 9. 
The vertical position of the center of mass G is designated by the distance 
h below the fixed horizontal reference line and is h = b cos 8 + c. The work done 
by mg during a movement 8h in the direction of mg is 
+mg lJh = mg lJ(b cos 0 +c) 
= mg(-b sin868 + 0) 
= -mgb sin 9 89 
CD The minus sign shows that the work is negative for a positive value of 88. The 
constant c drops out since its variation is zero. 
With 8 measured positive in the clockwise sense, 89 is also positive clock­
wise. Thus, the work done by the clockwise couple M is +M 88. Substitution into 
the virtual-work equation gives us 
[8U= 0) 
which yields 
M88 + mg8h = 0 
M 88 = mgb sin 888

Ans. 
Inasmuch as sin 0 cannot exced unity, we see that for equilibrium, M is limited 
to values that do not exceed mgb. 
The advantage of the virtual-work solution for this problem is readily seen 
when we observe what would be involved with a solution by force and moment 
equilibrium. For the latter approach, it would be necessary for us to draw sepa­
rate fre-body diagrams of al of the three moving parts and account for all of the 
internal reactions at the pin connections. To carry out these steps, it would be 
necessary for us to include in the analysis the horizontal position of G with re­
spect to the attachment points of the two links, even though reference to this 
position would finally drop out of the equations when they were solved. We 
conclude, then, that the virtual-work method in this problem deals directly 
with cause and effect and avoids reference to irrelevant quantities.

Solution. The given sketch serves as the active-force diagram for the system. 
Al other forces are either internal or nonworking reactive forces due to the con­
straints. 
We will give the crank OA a small clockwise angular movement M as our 
virtual displacement and determine the resulting virtual work done by M and P. 
From the horizontal position of the crank, the angular movement gives a down­
ward displacement of A equal to 
oy =aBO

accounting for all forces initially and then eliminating the irrelevant ones.

7/4 POTENTIAL E N ERGY A N D  STA B I LITY 
The previous article treated the equilibrium configuration of me­
chanical systems composed of individual members which we assumed to 
be perfectly rigid. We now extend our method to account for mechanical 
systems which include elastic elements in the form of springs. We intro­
duce the concept of potential energy, which is useful for determining the 
stability of equilibrium. 
Elastic Potential Energy 
The work done on an elastic member is stored in the member in the 
form of elastic potential energy v •. This energy is potentially available 
to do work on some other body during the relief of its compression or 
extension. 
Consider a spring, Fig. 7/11, which is being compressed by a force F. 
We assume that the spring is elastic and linear, which means that the 
force F is directly proportional to the deflection x. We write this relation 
as F = kx, where k is the spring constant or stiffness of the spring. The 
work done on the spring by F during a movement dx is dU = F dx, so 
that the elastic potential energy of the spring for a compression x is the 
total work done on the spring 
Ve 
= I: F dx  = I: kx dx 
or 
[ v. 
= kx2) 
(7/4) 
Thus, the potential energy of the spring equals the trian.gular area in 
the diagram ofF versus x from 0 to x. 
During an increase in the compression of the spring from x1 to ¦. the 
work done on the spring equals its change in elastic potential energy or 
which equals the trapezoidal area from x1 to x2 • 
During a virtual displacement 8x of the spring, the virtual work 
done on the spring is the virtual change in elastic potential energy 
8 V. = F 8x = kx 8x 
During a decrease in the compression of the spring as it is relaxed 
from x = x2 to x = x1, the change (final minus initial) in the potential en­
ergy of the spring is negative. Consequently, if 8x is negative, av. is also 
negative. 
When we have a spring in tension rather than compression, the 
work and energy relations are the same as those for compression, where 
x now represents the elongation of the spring rather than its compres­
sion. While the spring is being stretched, the force again acts in the di­
rection of the displacement, doing positive work on the spring and 
increasing its potential energy.

Because the force acting on the movable end of a spring is the nega­
tive of the force exerted by the spring on the body to which its movable 
end is attached, the work done on the body is the negative of the potential 
energy change of the spring. 
A torsional spring, which resists the rotation of a shaft or another 
element, can also store and release potential energy. If the torsional 
stifness, expressed as torque per radian of twist, is a constant kr, and if 
8 is the angle of twist in radians, then the resisting torque is M = kr8. 
The potential energy becomes v. 
= f0 kr8 d9 or 
(7/4a) 
which is analogous to the expression for the linear extension spring. 
The units of elastic potential energy are the same as those of work 
and are expressed in joules (J) in SI units and in foot-pounds (ft-lb) in 
U.S. customary units. 
Gravitational Potential Energy 
In the previous article we treated the work of a gravitational force 
or weight acting on a body in the sam.e way as the work of any other ac­
tive force. Thus, for an upward displacement Bh of the body in Fig. 7/12 
the weight W 
= mg does negative work BU = -mg Bh. If, on the other 
hand, the body has a downward displacement 13h, with h measured pos­
itive downward, the weight does positive work 8U = +mg Bh. 
An alternative to the foregoing treatment expresses the work done 
by gravity in terms of a change in potential energy of the body. This al­
ternative treatment is a useful representation when we describe a me­
chanical system in terms of its total energy. The gravitational potential 
energy Vg of a body is defined as the work done on the body by a force 
equal and opposite to the weight in bringing the body to the position 
under consideration from some arbitrary datum plane where the poten­
tial energy is defined to be zero. The potential energy, then, is the nega­
tive of the work done by the weight. When the body is raised, for 
example, the work done is converted into energy which is potentially 
available, since the body can do work on some other body as it returns 
to its original lower position. If we take V8 to be zero at h = 0, Fig. 7/12, 
then at a height h above the datum plane, the gravitational potential 
energy of the body is 
(7/5) 
If the body is a distance h below the datum plane, its gravitational po­
tential energy is -mgh. 
Note that the datum plane for zero potential energy is arbitrary be­
cause only the change in potential energy matters, and this change is 
the same no matter where we place the datum plane. Note also that the 
gravitational potential energy is independent of the path followed in ar­
riving at a particular level h. Thus, the body of mass m in Fig. 7/13 has 

Articl e 7/4 P ote ntial E n e rg y  and Stability 413 
the same potential-energy change n o  matter which path i t  follows in 
going from datum plane 1 to datum plane 2 because llh is the same for 
all three paths. 
The virtual change in gravitational potential energy is simply 
8 V6 = mg 8h 
where oh is the upward virtual displacement of the mass center of the 
body. If the mass center has a downward virtual displacement, then 8V6 
is negative. 
The units of gravitational potential energy are the same as those for 
work and elastic potential energy, joules (J) in SI units and foot-pounds 
(fl;-lb) in U.S. customary units. 
Energy Equation 
We saw that the work done by a linear spring on the body to which 
its movable end is attached is the negative of the change in the elastic 
potential energy of the spring. Also, the work done by the gravitational 
force or weight mg is the negative of the change in gravitational poten­
tial energy. Therefore, when we apply the virtual-work equation to a 
system with springs and with changes in the vertical position of its 
members, we may replace the work of the springs and the work of the 
weights by the negative of the respective potential energy changes. 
We can use these substitutions to write the total virtual work oU in 
Eq. 7/3 as the sum of the work 8 U' done by all active forces, other than 
spring forces and weight forces, and the work -(oV. + 8V6) done by the 
spring and weight forces. Equation 7/3 then becomes 
or ( 8U' = oV) 
{7/6) 
where V = v. + V6 stands for the total potential energy of the system. 
With this formulation a spring becomes internal to the system, and the 
work of spring and gravitational forces is accounted for in the 8 V  term. 
Active-Force Diagrams 
With the method of virtual work it is useful to construct the active­
force diagram of the system you are analyzing. The boundary of the sys­
tem must clearly distinguish those members which are part of the 
system from other bodies which are not part of the system. When we in­
clude an elastic member within the boundary of our system, the forces 
of interaction between it and the movable members to which it is at­
tached are internal to the system. Thus these forces need not be shown 
because their effects are accounted for in the V., term. Similarly, weight 
forces are not shown because their work is accounted for in the V6 term. 
Figure 7/14 illustrates the difference between the use ofEqs. 7/3 and 
7/6. We consider the body in part a of the figure to be a particle for sim­
plicity, and we assume that the virtual displacement is along the fixed 
path. The particle is in equilibrium under the action of the applied forces 
F1 and F2, the gravitational force mg, the spring force kx, and a normal

reaction force. In Fig 7/14b, where the particle alone is isolated, 5U in­
cludes the virtual work of all forces shown on the active-force diagram of 
the particle. (The normal reaction exerted on the particle by the smooth 
guide does no work and is omitted.) In Fig. 7/14c the spring is included in 
the system, and 5U' is the virtual work of only F1 and F2, which are the 
only external forces whose work is not accounted for in the potential­
energy terms. The work of the weight mg is accounted for in the 5V8 
term, and the work of the spring force is included in the 5V., term. 
Principle of Virtual Work 
Thus, for a mechanical system with elastic members and members 
which undergo changes in position, we may restate the principle of vir­
tual work as follows: 
The virtual work done by all external active forces (other 
than the gravitational and spring forces accounted for in 
the potential energy terms) on a mechanical system in 
equilibrium equals the corresponding change in the total 
elastic and gravitational potential energy of the system 
for any and al virtual displacements consistent with the 
constraints. 

Articl e 7/4 P ote ntial E n e rg y  and Stability 4 1 5  
Stability of Equilibrium 
Consider now the case of a mechanical system where movement is 
accompanied by changes in gravitational and elastic potential energies 
and where no work is done on the system by nonpotential forces. The 
mechanism treated in Sample Problem 7/6 is an example of such a sys­
tem. With 6U' 
= 0 the virtual-work relation, Eq. 7/6, becomes 
( c5(V. + Vg) = 0) 
or 
Equation 717 expresses the requirement that the equilibrium configura­
tion of a mechanical system is one for which the total potential energy V 
of the system has a stationary value. For a system of one degree of free­
dom where the potential energy and its derivatives are continuous func­
tion.s of the single variable, say, x, which describes the configuration, 
the equilibrium condition oV ""' 0 is equivalent mathematically to the 
requirement 
(718) 
Equation 7/8 states that a mechanical system is in equilibrium when the 
derivative of its total potential energy is zero. For systems with several 
degrees of freedom the partial derivative of V with respect to each coor­
dinate in turn must be zero for equilibrium.* 
There are three conditions under which Eq. 7/8 applies, namely, 
when the total potential energy is a minimum (stable equilibrium), a 
maximum (unstable equilibrium), or a constant (neutral equilibrium). 
Figure 7/15 shows a simple example of these three conditions. The po­
tential energy of the roller is clearly a minimum in the stable position, 
a maximum in the unstable position, and a constant in the neutral 
position. 
We may also characterize the stability of a mechanical system by 
noting that a small displacement away from the stable position results 
in an increase in potential energy and a tendency to return to the posi­
tion of lower energy. On the other hand, a small displacement away 
from the unstable position results in a decrease in potential energy and

a tendency to move farther away from the equilibrium position to one of 
still lower energy. For the neutral position a small displacement one 
way or the other results in no change in potential energy and no ten­
dency to move either way. 
When a function and its derivatives are continuous, the second de­
rivative is positive at a point of minimum value of the function and 
negative at a point of maximum value of the function. Thus, the mathe­
matical conditions for equilibrium and stability of a system with a single 
degree of freedom x are:

dV

Stable 
d2V 
(7/9) 
- > 0 
dx2 
Unstable 
d2V 
dx2 < 0 
The second derivative of V may also be zero at the equilibrium position, 
in which case we must examine the sign of a higher derivative to ascer­
tain the type of equilibrium. When the order of the lowest remaining 
nonzero derivative is even, the equilibrium will be stable or unstable ac­
cording to whether the sign of this derivative is positive or negative. If 
the order of the derivative is odd, the equilibrium is classified as unsta­
ble, and the plot of V versus x for this case appears as an inflection point 
in the curve with zero slope at the equilibrium value. 
Stability criteria for multiple degrees of freedom require more ad­
vanced treatment. For two degrees of freedom, for example, we use a 
Taylor-series expansion for two variables.

Sample Problem 7/4 
The 10-kg cylinder is suspended by the spring , which has a stiffness of 
2 kN/m. Plot the potential energy V of the system and show that it is minimum 
at the equilibrium position. 
Solution. (Although the equilibrium position in this simple problem is clearly 
where the force in the spring equals the weight mg, we wil proceed as though 
this fact were unknown in order to illustrate the ener&'Y relationships in the sim­
plest way.) We choose the datum plane for zero potential energy at the position 
CD where the spring is unextended. 
The elastic potential energy for an arbitrary position x is v. = .kx2 and the 
gravitational potential energy is -mgx, so that the total potential energy is 
V =  !kx2 - mgx 
Equilibrium occurs where 
dV 
- = kx - mg = O 
dx 
x = mgfk 
Although we know in this simple case that the equilibrium is stable, we 
prove it by evaluating the sign of the second derivative of V at the equilibrium 
position. Thus, d2VIdx2 = k, which is positive, proving that the equilibrium is

Sample Problem 7/5 
The two uniform links, each of mass m, are in the vertical plane and are 
connected and constrained as shown. As the angle 9 between the links increases 
with the application of the horizontal force P, the light rod, which is connected 
at A and passes through a pivoted collar at B, compresses the spring of stiffness 
k. If the spring is uncompressed in the position where 9 = 0, determine the force 
P which will produce equilibrium at the angle 9. 
Solution. The given sketch serves as the active-force diagram of the system. 
The compression x of the spring is the distance which A has moved away from B, 
which is x = 2b sin 912. Thus, the elastic potential energy of the spring is 
[V. = -kx2J 
With the datum for zero gravitational potential energy taken through the 
support at 0 for convenience, the expression for VK becomes 
[V6 = mgh) 
VR

The distance between 0 and C is 4b sin 012, so that the virtual work done by 
P is

If we had ben asked to express the equilibrium value of 9 correspondin,g to 
a given force P, we would have difficulty solving explicitly for 9 in this particular 
case. But for a numerical problem we could resort to a computer solution and 
graphical plot of numerical values of the sum of the two functions of 9 to deter­
mine the value of fJ for which the sum equals P.

The ends of the uniform bar of mass m slide freely in the horizontal and

The spring of stiffness k is undeformed when x = 0. 
Solution. The system consists of the spring and the bar. Since there are no ex­
CD ternal active forces, the given sketch serves as the active-force diagram. We will 
take the x-axis as the datum for zero gravitational potential energy. In the dis­
placed position the elastic and gravitational potential energies are

Ans. 
Thus, if the spring is sufficiently stift; the bar will return to the vertical position 
@ even though there is no force in the spring at that position. 
Solution II. cos o = ;;!. o = cos-1 ;;! 
Since the cosine must be less than unity, we see that this solution is limited to 
the case where k > mg/2b, which makes the second derivative of V negative. 
@ Thus, equilibrium for Solution II is never stable. If k < mg/2b, we no longer 
have Solution II since the spring will be too weak to maintain equilibrium at a 
value of 8 between 0 and 90°.

7 / 5  C H A PTER REVIEW 
In this chapter w e  have developed the principle of virtual work. This 
principle is useful for determining the possible equilibrium configurations 
of a body or a system of interconnected bodies where the external forces are 
known. To apply the method successfully, you must understand the concepts 
of virtual displacement, degrees of freedom, and potential energy. 
Method ofVirtuai Work 
When various configurations are possible for a body or a system of 
interconnected bodies under the action of applied forces, we can find the 
equilibrium position by applying the principle of virtual work. When using 
this method, keep the following in mind. 
1. The only forces which need to be considered when determining the 
equilibrium position are those which do work (active forces) during the 
assumed differential movement of the body or system away from its 
equilibrium position. 
2. Those external forces which do no work (reactive forces) need not be 
involved. 
3. For this reason the active-force diagram of the body or system (rather 
than the free-body diagram) is useful to focus attention on only those 
external forces which do work during the virtual displacements. 
Virtual Displacements 
A virtual displacement is a first-order differential change in a linear 
or angular position. This change is fictitious in that it is an assumed 
movement which need not take place in reality. Mathematically, a virtual 
displacement is treated the same as a differential change in an actual move­
ment. We use the symbol 8 for the differential virtual change and the usual 
symbol d for the differential change in a real movement. 
Relating the linear and angular virtual displacements of the parts of a 
mechanical system during a virtual movement consistent with the constraints 
is often the most difficult part of the analysis. To do this, 
1. Write the geometric relationships which describe the configuration of 
the system. 
2. Establish the differential changes in the positions of parts of the 
system by differentiating the geometric relationship to obtain expres­
sions for the differential virtual movements. 
Degrees of Freedom 
In Chapter 7 we have restricted our attention to mechanical systems 
for which the positions of the members can be specified by a single variable 
(single-degree-of-freedom systems). For two or more degrees of freedom, we 

428 Chapter 7 Virtual Work 
would apply the virtual-work equation as many times as there are degrees of 
freedom, allowing one variable to change at a time while holding the remain­
ing ones constant. 
Potential Energy Method 
The concept of potential energy, both gravitational (V8) and elastic (Ve), 
is useful in solving equilibrium problems where virtual displacements cause 
changes in the vertical positions of the mass centers of the bodies and changes 
in the lengths of elastic members (springs). To apply this method, 
1. Obtain an expression for the total potential energy V of the system in 
terms of the variable which specifies the possible position of the system. 
2. Examine the first and second derivatives of V to establish, respectively, 
the position of equilibrium and the corresponding stability condition.

I NTRODUCTION 
When forces are distributed continuously over an area on which 
they act, it is often necessary to calculate the moment of these forces 
about some axis either in or perpendicular to the plane of the area. Fre­
quently the intensity of the force (pressure or stress) is proportional to 
the distance of the line of action of the force from the moment axis. The 
elemental force acting on an element of area, then, is proportional to 
distance times differential area, and the elemental moment is propor­
tional to distance squared times differential area. We see, therefore, 
that the total moment involves an integral ofform f (distance)2 d (area). 
This integral is called the moment of inertia or the second moment of the 
area. The integral is a function of the geometry of the area and occurs 
frequently in the applications of mechanics. Thus it is useful to develop 
its properties in some detail and to have these properties available for 
ready use when the integral arises. 
Figure Nl illustrates the physical origin of these integrals. In part a 
of the figure, the surface area ABCD is subjected to a distributed pres­
sure p whose intensity is proportional to the distance y from the axis 
AB. This situation was treated in Art. 519 of Chapter 5, where we de­
scribed the action of liquid pressure on a plane surface. The moment 
about AB due to the pressure on the element of area dA is py dA 
= 
ky2 dA. Thus, the integral in question appears when the total moment 
M = k f y2 dA is evaluated. 

In Fig. A/lb we show the distribution of stress acting on a transverse 
section of a simple elastic beam bent by equal and opposite couples 
applied to its ends. At any section of the beam, a linear distribution of 
force intensity or stress 0', given by 0' = ky, is present. The stress is posi­
tive (tensile) below the axis oȍo and negative (compressive) above the 
axis. We see that the elemental moment about the axis 0-0 is d M  = 
y(O' dA) = ky2 dA. Thus, the same integral appears when the total mo­
ment M = k I y2 dA is evaluated. 
A third example is given in Fig. Aile, which shows a circular shaft 
subjected to a twist or torsional moment. Within the elastic limit of the 
material, this moment is resisted at each cross section of the shaft by a 
distribution of tangential or shear stress -r, which is proportional to the 
radial distance r from the center. Thus, -r = kr, and the total moment 
about the central axis is M =  I r(-r dA) = k f r2 dA. Here the integral dif­
fers from that in the preceding two examples in that the area is normal 
instead of parallel to the moment axis and in that r is a radial coordinate 
instead of a rectangular one. 
Although the integral illustrated in the preceding examples is gen­
erally called the moment of inertia of the area about the axis in question, 
a more fitting term is the second moment of area, since the first moment 
y dA is multiplied by the moment arm y to obtain the second moment 
for the element dA. The word inertia appears in the terminology by rea­
son of the similarity between the mathematical form of the integrals for 
second moments of areas and those for the resultant moments of the 
s\ed inertia forces in the case of rotating bodies. The moment of iner­
tia of an area is a purely mathematical property of the area and in itself 
has no physical significance. 
A/2 D E FI N ITIONS 
The following definitions form the basis for the analysis of area mo­
ments of inertia. 
Rectangular and Polar Moments of Inertia 
Consider the area A in the x-y plane, Fig. A/2. The moments of iner­
tia of the element dA about the x- and y-axes are, by definition, dl:x = 
y2 dA and dly = x2 dA, respectively. The moments of inertia of A about 
the same axes are therefore 
L. = f y2 dA 
ly = J x2 dA 
where we carry out the integration over the entire area.

The moment of inertia of dA about the pole 0 (z-axis) is, by similar 
definition, dlz = r2 dA. The moment of inertia of the entire area about 
Ois 
(A/2) 
The expressions defined by Eqs. All are called rectangular moments of 
inertia, whereas the expression ofEq. A/2 is called the polar moment of 
inertia.* Because x2 + y2 =.it is clear that 
(A/3) 
For an area whose boundaries are more simply described in rectangular 
coordinates than in polar coordinates, its polar moment of inertia is eas­
ily calculated with the aid of Eq. A/3. 
The moment of inertia of an element involves the square of the dis­
tance from the inertia axis to the element. Thus an element whose coor­
dinate is negative contributes as much to the moment of inertia as does 
an equal element with a positive coordinate of the same magnitude. 
Consequently the area moment of inertia about any axis is always a posi­
tive quantity. In contrast, the first moment of the area, which was in­
volved in the computations of centroids, could be either positive, 
negative, or zero. 
The dimensions of moments of inertia of areas are clearly L4, where 
L stands for the dimension of length. Thus, the SI units for area mo­
ments of inertia are expressed as quartic meters (m4) or quartic millime­
ters (mm4). The U.S. customary units for area moments of inertia are 
quartic feet (ft4) or quartic inches (in.4). 
The choice of the coordinates to use for the calculation of moments 
of inertia is important. Rectangular coordinates should be used for 
shapes whose boundaries are most easily expressed in these coordinates. 
Polar coordinates will usually simplify problems involving boundaries 
which are easily described in rand 9. The choice of an element of area 
which simplifies the integration as much as possible is also important. 
These considerations are quite analogous to those we discussed and il­
lustrated in Chapter 5 for the calculation of centroids. 
Radius of Gyration 
Consider an area A, Fig. A/3a, which has rectangular moments of 
inertia Ix and Iy and a polar moment of inertia Iz about 0. We now visu­
alize this area as concentrated into a long narrow strip of area A a dis­
tance k,. from the x-axis, Fig. A/3b. By definition the moment of inertia 
of the strip about the x-axis will be the same as that of the original area 
if kx 2 A = Ix. The distance kx is called the radius of gyration of the area 
*The polar moment of inertia of an area is sometimes denoted in mechanics literature by 
the symbol J.

about the x-axis. A similar relation for they-axis is written by consider­
ing the area as concentrated into a narrow strip parallel to they-axis as 
shown in Fig. A/3c. Also, if we visualize the area as concentrated into a 
narrow ring of radius k11 as shown in Fig. A/3d, we may express the polar 
moment of inertia as kz 2 A = Iz. In summary we write 
fx = kx2A 
kx = JI,/A 
ly = k/A 
or 
ky = JI/A 
(A/4) 
lz = kz2A 
kz = JI/A 
The radius of gyration, then, is a measure of the distribution of the area 
from the axis in question. A rectangular or polar moment of inertia may 
be expressed by specifying the radius of gyration and the area. 
When we substitute Eqs. A/4 into Eq. A/3, we have 
(A/5) 
Thus, the square of the radius of gyration about a polar axis equals the 
sum of the squares of the radii of gyration about the two corresponding 
rectangular axes. 
Do not confuse the coordinate to the centroid C of an area with the 
radius of gyration. In Fig. A/3a the square of the centroidal distance 
from the x-axis, for example, is y2, which is the square of the mean 
value of the distances from the elements of the area to the x-axis. The 
quantity kx2, on the other hand, is the mean of the squares of these dis­
tances. The moment of inertia is not equal to Ay2, since the square of 
the mean is less than the mean of the squares. 
Transfer of Axes 
The moment of inertia of an area about a noncentroidal axis may be 
easily expressed in terms of the moment of inertia about a parallel cen­
troidal axis. In Fig. A/4 the x0-y0 axes pass through the centroid C of the 
area. Let us now determine the moments of inertia of the area about the

parallel x-y axes. By definition, the moment of inertia of the element dA 
about the x-axis is 
Expanding and integrating give us 
We see that the first integral is by definition the moment of inertia lx 
about the centroidal x0-axis. The second integral is zero, since f y0 dA = 
Ay0 and .Yo is automatically zero with the centroid on the x0-axis. The 
third term is simply Adx 2• Thus, the expression for Ix and the similar 
expression for Iy become 
lx = lx + Adx2 
--

ly - ly + Ady 
By Eq. A/3 the sum of these two equations gives 
(A/6) 
(A/6a) 
Equations A/6 and A/6a are the so-called parallel-axis theorems. Two 
points in particular should be noted. First, the axes between which the 
transfer is made must be parallel, and second, one of the axes must pass 
through the centroid of the area. 
If a transfer is desired between two parallel axes neither of which 
passes through the centroid, it is first necessary to transfer from one 
axis to the parallel centroidal axis and then to transfer from the cen­
troidal axis to the second axis. 
The parallel-axis theorems also hold for radii of gyration. With sub­
stitution of the definition of k into Eqs. A/6, the transfer relation 
becomes 
(A/6b) 
where k is the radius of gyration about a centroidal axis parallel to the 
axis about which k applies and d is the distance between the two axes. 
The axes may be either in the plane or normal to the plane of the area. 
A summary of the moment-of-inertia relations for some common 
plane figures is given in Table D/3, Appendix D.

of Sample Problem A/3, 
We obtain the moment of inertia l about the parallel centroidal axis x0 next.

Calculate the moment of inertia about the x-axis of the area enclosed be­

Solution. The choice of a vertical differential strip of area permits one integra­
tion to cover the entire area. A horizontal strip would require two integrations 
with respect to y by virtue of the discontinuity. The moment of inertia of the 
strip about thex-a.xis is that of a strip of heighty2 minus that of a strip of height 
y1• Thus, from the results of Sample Problem All we write 
The values of y2 and y1 are obtained from the equations of the two curves, 
which are x2 + 
z2 = a2 and (x- a)2 + y12 = a2, and which give Y2 = 
a2 - x?

A/3 COMPOSITE AREAS 
It i s  frequently necessary to calculate the moment of inertia of an 
area composed of a number of distinct parts of simple and calculable 
geometric shape. Because a moment of inertia is the integral or sum of 
the products of distance squared times element of area, it follows that 
the moment of inertia of a positive area is always a positive quantity. 
The moment of inertia of a composite area about a particular axis is 
therefore simply the sum of the moments of inertia of its component 
parts about the same axis. It is often convenient to regard a composite 
area as being composed of positive and negative parts. We may then 
treat the moment of inertia of a negative area as a negative quantity. 
When a composite area is composed of a large number of parts, it is 
convenient to tabulate the results for each of the parts in terms of its 
area A, its centroidal moment of inertia I, the distance d from its cen­
troidal axis to the axis about which the moment of inertia of the entire 
section is being computed, and the productAd2. For any one of the parts 
the moment of inertia about the desired axis by the transfer-of-axis the­
orem is I+ Ad2• Thus, for the entire section the desired moment ofine¿ 
tia becomes I = I.J + I.Ad2. 
For such an area in the x-y plane, for example, and with the nota­
tion of Fig. A/4, where lx is the same as I"" and Iy is the same as ly0 the 
tabulation would include

Although we may add the moments of inertia of the individual parts 
of a composite area about a given axis, we may not add their radii of gy­
ration. The radius of gyration for the composite area about the axis in 
question is given by k = II A, where I is the total moment of inertia and 
A is the total area of the composite figure. Similarly, the radius of gyra­
tion k about a polar axis through some point equals Jiz/A, where lz = 
lx + ly for x-y axes through that point.

Sample Problem A/8 
Calculate the moment of inertia and radius of gyration about the x-axis for 
the shaded area shown. Wherever possible, make expedient use of tabulated 
moments of inertia. 
Solution. The composite area is composed of the positive area of the rectangle 
(1) and the negative areas of the quarter circle (2) and triangle (3). For the rec­
tangle the moment of inertia about the x-axis, from Sample Problem N1 (or 
Table D/3), is 
From Sample Problem N3 (or Table D/3), the moment of inertia of the negative 
quarter-circular area about its base axis x' is 
We now transfer this result through the distance r = 4r/(3?T) = 4(30)/(317') = 
12.73 mm by the transfer-of-axis theorem to get the centroidal moment of iner­
tia of part (2) (or use Table D/3 directly). 
CD [I = I - Ad2] 
I,.= -0.1590(106)- [ _1T(!0)2 (12.73)2]

I,.= -0.0445(106) + [-1T(!0)2](60-12.73)2

Finally, the moment of inertia of the negative triangular area (3) about its base, 
from Sample Problem N2 (or Table D/3), is 
I,.= -bbh3 = -{2<40)(30)3 = -0.90(106) mm4 
The total moment of inertia about the x-axis of the composite area is, 
consequently, 
Ans. 
This result agrees with that of Sample Problem N7.

Art icl e A/4 Products of Inerti a  and Rotati on of Axes 457 
A/4 PROD UCTS OF I N E RT I A  AND ROTATION O F  AXES 
In this article, we define the product of inertia with respect to rec­
tangular axes and develop the parallel-axis theorem for centroidal and 
noncentroidal axes. In addition, we discuss the effects of rotation of axes 
on moments and products of inertia. 
Definition 
In certain problems involving unsymmetrical cross sections and in 
the calculation of moments of inertia about rotated axes, an expression 
dlry = xy dA occurs, which has the integrated form 
(A/7) 
where x andy are the coordinates of the element of area dA = dx dy. 
The quantity Iry is called the product of inertia of the area A with re­
spect to the x-y axes. Unlike moments of inertia, which are always posi­
tive for positive areas, the product of inertia may be positive, negative, 
or zero. 
The product of inertia is zero whenever either of the reference axes 
is an axis of symmetry, such as the x-axi.s for the area in Fig. A/5. Here 
we see that the sum of the terms x( -y) dA and x( +y) dA due to symmet­
rically placed elements vanishes. Because the entire area may be consid­
ered as composed of pairs of such elements, it follows that the product of 
inertia Iry for the entire area is zero. 
Transfer of Axes 
By definition the product of inertia of the area A in Fig. A/4 with re­
spect to the x- andy-axes in terms of the coordinates x0, y0 to the cen­
troidal axes is 
Iry = I (xo + dy)(yo + dx) dA

458 Appendix A Area M o m e nts of Inertia 
The first integral is by definition the product of inertia about the cen­
troidal axes, which we write as Ixy. The middle two integrals are both 
zero because the first moment of the area about its own centroid is nec­
essarily zero. The fourth term is merely dxdyA. Thus, the transfer-of­
axis theorem for products of inertia becomes 
Rotation of Axes 
( 
Iry = Iry + dxdyA J 
(A/8) 
The product of inertia is useful when we need to calculate the mo­
ment of inertia of an area about inclined axes. This consideration leads 
directly to the important problem of determining the axes about which 
the mome.nt of inertia is a maximum and a minimum. 
In Fig. A/6 the moments of inertia of the area about the x'- and y'­
axes are 
J"', = J y ' 2  dA = J (y cos 8 - x sin 8)2 dA 
ly· = J x'2 dA = J (y sin 8 + x cos 8)2 dA 
where x' and y' have been replaced by their equivalent expressions as 
seen from the geometry of the figure.

In a similar manner we write the product of inertia about the in­
clined axes as 
1x'y' = J x'y' dA = J (y sin 0 + x cos O)(y cos 0 - x sin 0) dA

Adding Eqs. A/9 gives 1:r:' + 1y' = 1x + 1y = 1z, the polar moment of iner­
tia about 0, which checks the results of Eq. A/3. 
The angle which makes 1:.:· and 1y• either maximum or minimum 
may be determined by setting the derivative of either 1x' or 1y• with re­
spect to 0 equal to zero. Thus,

Denoting this critical angle by a gives 
(A/10) 
Equation A/10 gives two values for 2a which differ by "'• since tan 2a = 
tan (2a + 1r). Consequently the two solutions for a will differ by 'T/2. 
One value defines the axis of maximum moment of inertia, and the 
other value defines the axis of minimum moment of inertia. These two 
rectangular axes are called the principal axes of inertia. 
When we substitute Eq. A/10 for the critical value of 20 in Eq. A/9a, 
we see that the product of inertia is zero for the principal axes of inertia. 
Substitution of sin 2a and cos 2a, obtained from Eq. A/10, for sin 20 and 
cos 28 in Eqs. A/9 gives the expressions for the principal moments of in­
ertia as

graphically by a diagram called Mohr's circle. For given values of 1:r:, 1y,

and I;r;y the corresponding values of I,.., ]1., and lx'y' may be determined 
from the diagram for any desired angle 8. A horizontal axis for the mea­
surement of moments of inertia and a vertical axis for the measurement 
of products of inertia are first selected, Fig. A/7. Next, point A, which 
has the coordinates (lx, I;r;y), and point B, which has the coordinates 
(11, -Ixy), are located. 
We now draw a circle with these two points as the extremities of a 
diameter. The angle from the radius OA to the horizontal axis is 2a or 
twice the angle from the x-axis of the area in question to the axis of 
maximum moment of inertia. The angle on the diagram and the angle 
on the area are both measured in the same sense as shown. The coordi­
nates of any point C are Ux·• Ix•y•), and those of the corresponding point 
D are  (11., -lx·y•). Also the angle between OA and OC is 28 or twice the 
angle from the x-axis to the x' -axis. Again we measure both angles in the 
same sense as shown. We may verify from the trigonometry of the circle 
that Eqs. A/9, A/9a, and A/10 agree with the statements made.

Sample Problem A/9 
Determine the product of inertia of the rectangular area with centroid at C 
with respect to the x..y axes parallel to its sides. 
Solution. Since the product of inertia Ix.y about the axes x0-y0 is zero by sym­
metry, the transfer-of-axis theorem gives us 
Ans. 
In this example both d., and dy are shown positive. We must be careful to be con­
sistent with the positive directions of dG and dy as defined, so that their proper 
signs are observed. 
Sample Problem A/10 
Determine the product of inertia about the x  axes for the area under the 
parabola. 
Solution. With the substitution of x = a wheny = b, the equation of the curve 
becomes x = ay2/b2• 
Solution I. If we start with the second-order element dA = dx dy, we have 
dlx.y = xy dx dy. The integral over the entire area is 
Ans. 
Solution II. Alternatively, we can start with a first-order elemental strip and 
save one integration by using the results of Sample Problem N9. Taking a verti­
CD cal strip dA = y dx gives dl-zy = 0 + (y)(x)(y dx), where the distances to the cen­
troidal axes of the elemental rectangle are d"' = y/2 and dy = x. Now we have 
Ans. 
Helpful Hint 
CD If we had chosen a horizontal strip, our expression would have become 
dlxy = y (a + x)[(a - x) dy), which when integrated, of course, gives us 
the same result as before. 
Sample Problem A/11 
Determine the product of inertia of the semicircular area with respect to the

Sample Problem A/ 1 2  
Determine the orientation of the principal axes of inertia through the cen­
troid of the angle section and detennine the corresponding maximum and mini­
mum moments of inertia. 
Solution. The location of the centroid C is easily calculated, and its position is 
shown on the diagram. 
Products of Inertia. The product of inertia for each rectangle about its cen­
troidal axes parallel to the x-y axes is zero by symmetry. Thus, the product of in­
ertia about the x-y axes for part I is 
[l:ey = f"iY + dxdyA] 
where 
and 
Likewise for part II, 
[I:ey = l"" + d..d,Al 
Ixy = 0 + (-12.5)(+7.5)(400) = -3.75(104) mm4 
dx = -(7.5 + 5) = -12.5 mm 
d1 = +(20-10-2.5) = 7.5 mm 
I"" = 0 + (12.5)( -7.5)(400) = -3.75(104) mm4 
where 
dx = +(20-7.5) = 12.5 mm, 
d1 = -(5 + 2.5) = -7.5 mm 
For the complete angle, 
I:ey = -3.75(104) -3.75(104) = -7.5(104) mm4 
Moments of Inertia. The moments of inertia about the x- and y-axes for part I 
are 
[I = l + AdZ] 
I., = 1(40)(10)3 + (400)(12.5)2 = 6.58(104) mm4 
I1 = 1(10)(40)3 + (400)(7.5)2 = 7.58(104) mm4 
and the moments of inertia for part II about these same axes are 
[I = I+ AdZ] 
I" = 1(10)(40)3 + (400)(12.5)2 = 11.58(104) mm4 
I1 = 112(40)(10)3 + (400)(7.5)2 = 2.58(104) mm4 
Thus, for the entire section we have 
Ix = 6.58(10)4 + 11.58(10)4 = 18.17(104) mm4 
I1 = 7.58(104) + 2.58(104) = 10.17(104) mm4 
Principal Axes. The inclination of the principal axes of inertia is given by 
Eq. N10, so we have 
[ tan 2a .. 
2I:ey ] 
11 - Ix 
2( -7.50) 
tan 2a .. 10.17 -18.17 .. 1.875 
2a = 61.9° a =  31.0° 
Ans. 
We now compute the principal moments of inertia from Eqs. A/9 using a for 
8 and get I max from Ix· and I .run from I1 •• Thus,

MASS MOMENTS 
OF INERTIA 
See Vol. 2 Dynamics for Appendix B, which fully treats the concept 
and calculation of mass moment of inertia. Because this quantity is an 
important element in the study of rigid-body dynamics and is not a fac­
tor in statics, we present only a brief definition in this Statics volume so 
that the student can appreciate the basic differences between area and 
mass moments of inertia. 
Consider a three-dimensional body of mass m as shown in Fig. B/1. 
The mass moment of inertia I about the axis 0-0 is defined as 
I = J r2 d m  
where r is the perpendicular distance of the mass element d m  from the 
axis 0-0 and where the integration is over the entire body. For a given 
rigid body the mass moment of inertia is a measure of the distribution of 
its mass relative to the axis in question, and for that axis is a constant 
property of the body. Note that the dimensions are (mass)(length?, 
which are kg · m2 in SI units and lb-ft-sec2 in U.S. customary units. Con­
trast these dimensions with those of area moment of inertia, which are 
(length)4, m4 in SI units and ft4 in U.S. customary units.

C/1 
I NTRODUCTION 
Appendix C contains an abbreviated sumary and reminder of se­
lected topics in basic mathematics which find frequent use in mechanics. 
The relationships are cited without proof The student of mechanics will 
have frequent ocasion to use many of these relations, and he or she will be 
handicapped if they are not well in hand. Other topics not listed wil also 
be needed from time to time. 
As the reader reviews and applies mathematics, he or she should 
bear in mind that mechanics is an applied science descriptive of real 
bodies and actual motions. Therefore, the geometric and physical inter­
pretation of the applicable mathematics should be kept clearly in mind 
during the development of theory and the formulation and solution of 
problems.

C/7 VECTOR OPE RATIONS 
1 .  Notation. Vector quantities 
are printed in boldface type, and 
scalar quantities appear in lightface italic type. Thus, the vector 
quantity V has a scalar magnitude V. In longhand work vector 
quantities should always be consistently indicated by a symbol such 
as ü or V to distinguish them from scalar quantities. 
2. Addition 
Triangle addition 
P + Q = R 
Parallelogram addition 
P + Q = R 
Commutative law P + Q = Q + P 
Associative law P + ( Q + R) = (P + Q) + R 
3. Subtraction 
p - Q = p + (-Q) 
4. Unit vectors i, j, k 
V = V J + Vyj + Vzk

6. Dot or scalar product 
P·Q = PQ cos 0 
This product may be viewed as the magnitude of P multiplied by 
the component Q cos 0 of Q in the direction of P, or as the magni­
tude of Q multiplied by the component P cos 0 of P in the direction 
of Q. 
Commutative law 
P·Q = Q·P 
From the definition of the dot product 
i·i = j ·j = k·k = 1 
i·j = j ·i = i·k = k·i = j ·k = k·j = 0 
P·Q = (P.,i + Pyj + Pzk)· (Q.,i + Qyj + Qzk) 
= P.,Q., + P,Q, + PZQ% 
P·P = Px2 + P/ + Pz2 
It follows from the definition of the dot product that two vec­
tors P and Q are perpendicular when their dot product vanishes, 
P·Q = 0. 
The angle 0 between two vectors P1 and P2 may be found from 
their dot product expression P1• P2 = P1P2 cos 0, which gives 
where l, m, n stand for the respective direction cosines of the 
vectors. It is also observed that two vectors are perpendicular to each 
other when their direction cosines obey the relation l1l2 + m1m2 + 
n1n2 = 0. 
Distributive law 
P·(Q + R) = P · Q  + P·R 
7. Cross or vector product. The cross product P x Q of the two 
vectors P and Q is defined as a vector with a magnitude 
I P x Ql = PQ sin 0 
and a direction specified by the right-hand rule as shown. Reversing 
the vector order and using the right-hand rule give Q x P 
-P X Q. 
Distributive law 
P X (Q + R) = P X Q + P X R 
From the definition of the cross product, using a right·handed 
coordinate system, we get 
i x j = k 
j x k = i 
k x i = j 
j X i = -k 
k X j = -i 
i X k = -j 
i X i = j X j = k X k = O 

With the aid of these identities and the distributive law, the vector 
product may be written 
P X Q = (P;ri + Pyj + Pzk) X (Q .. ,i + Qyj + Qzk) 
= (PyQz - PzQy)i + (PzQx - PxQz)j + (PxQy - PyQx)k 
The cross product may also be expressed by the determinant 
i 
j 
k 
P x Q = P" Py P., 
Qx QY Qz 
8. Additional relations 
Triple scalar product (P x Q)·R = R·(P x Q). The dot and cross 
may be interchanged as long as the order of the vectors is main­
tained. Parentheses are unnecessary since P x (Q·R) is meaning­
less because a vector P cannot be crossed into a scalar Q· R. Thus, 
the expression may be written 
p X Q·R = P·Q X R 
The triple scalar product has the determinant expansion 
px Py pz 
p X Q. R = Q% Qy Q% 
Rx Ry R:. 
Triple vector product (P x Q) x R = -R x (P x Q) = R x 
(Q x P). Here we note that the parentheses must be used since an 
expression P x Q x R would be ambiguous because it would not 
identify the vector to be crossed. It may be shown that the triple 
vector product is equivalent to 
or 
(P X Q) X R = R·PQ - R·QP 
P x (Q x R) = P·RQ - P·QR 
The first term in the first expression, for example, is the dot prod­
uct R • P, a scalar, multiplied by the vector Q.

10. Integration of vectors. If V is a function of x, y, and z and an el­
ement of volume is dT = dx dy dz, the integral ofV over the volume 
may be written as the vector sum of the three integrals of its com­
ponents. Thus,

C/ 1 1  N EWTON'S M ETHOD FOR SOLVING 
I N TR ACTA BLE EQUATIONS 
Frequently, the application of the fundamental principles of me­
chanics leads to an algebraic or transcendental equation which is not 
solvable (or easily solvable) in closed form. In such cases, an iterative 
technique, such as Newton's method, can be a powerful tool for obtain­
ing a good estimate to the root or roots of the equation.

(a) 
Let us place the equation to be solved in the form f(x) = 0. Part a of 
the accompanying figure depicts an arbitrary function f(x) for values of 
x in the vicinity of the desired root x,. Note that Xr is merely the value 
f(x) 
(b) 
(c) 
of x at which the function crosses the x-axis. Suppose that we have avail­
able (perhaps via a hand-drawn plot) a rough estimate x1 of this root. 
Provided that x1 does not closely correspond to a maximum or minimum 
value of the function f(x), we may obtain a better estimate of the root Xr 
by extending the tangent to f(x) at x1 so that it intersects the x-axis at 
x2• From the geometry of the figure, we may write 
where f'(x1) denotes the derivative of f(x) with respect to x evaluated at 
x = x1. Solving the above equation for x2 results in 
The term -f(x1)/f'(x1) is the correction to the initial root estimate x1. 
Once x2 is calculated, we may repeat the process to obtain x3, and so 
forth. 
Thus, we generalize the above equation to 
where 
xk + l  = the (k + l )th estimate of the desired root xr 
xk = the kth estimate of the desired root Xr 
f(xk ) = the function f(x) evaluated at x = xk 
f' (xk) = the function derivative evaluated at x = xk 
This equation is repeatedly applied until f(xlt+ 1) is sufficiently close to 
zero and xk+1 e xk. The student should verify that the equation is valid 
for all possible sign combinations of xk, f(xk), and f'(xk). 

A r t i c l e  C/1 2 
S e l ected Tech n i q ue s  for N u m e r i c a l  I ntegrat i o n  481 
Several cautionary notes are in order: 
1. Clearly, f'(xk) must not be zero or close to zero. This would mean, 
as restricted above, that xk exactly or approximately corresponds to 
a minimum or maximum of f(x). If the slope f'(xk) is zero, then the 
tangent to the curve never intersects the x-axis. If the slope f'(xk) is 
small, then the correction to xk may be so large that xk+J is a worse 
root estimate than xk. For this reason, experienced engineers usu­
ally limit the size of the correction term; that is, if the absolute 
value of f(;ck)lf'(xk) is larger than a preselected maximum value, 
that maximum value is used. 
2. If there are several roots of the equation f(x) = 0, we must be in the 
vicinity of the desired root x, in order that the algorithm actually 
converges to that root. Part b of the figure depicts the condition 
when the initial estimate x1 will result in convergence to x,1 rather 
than x,,. 
3. Oscillation from one side of the root to the other can occur if, for ex­
ample, the function is antisymmetric about a root which is an inflec­
tion point. The use of one-half of the correction will usually prevent 
this behavior, which is depicted in part c of the accompanying figure. 
Example: Beginning with an initial estimate of x1 
= 5, estimate the 
single root of the equation e" - 10 cos x - 100 = 0. 
The table below summarizes the application of Newton's method to 
the given equation. The iterative process was terminated when the ab­
solute value of the correction -f(xk)lf'(xk) became less than 10-6.

1. Area determination. Consider the problem of determining the 
shaded area under the curve y = f()c) from x = a to x = b, as depicted in 
part a of the figure, and suppose that analytical integration is not feasi­
ble. The function may be known in tabular form from experimental 
measurements, or it may be known in analytical form. The function is 
taken to be continuous within the interval a <  x < b. We may divide the 
area into n vertical strips, each of width ilx = (b - a)ln, and then add 
the areas of all strips to obtain A = f y dx. A representative strip of area 
Ai is shown with darker shading in the figure. Three useful numerical 
approximations are cited. In each case the greater the number of strips, 
the more accurate becomes the approximation geometrically. As a gen­
eral rule, one can begin with a relatively small number of strips and 

482 A p p e n d i x  C 
S e l ected T o p i c s  of M a t h e m a t i cs 
increase the number until the resulting changes in the area approxima­
tion no longer improve the accuracy obtained.

I. Rectangular [Figure (b)] The areas of the strips are taken to be 
rectangles, as shown by the representative strip whose height Ym is cho­
sen visually so that the small cross-hatched areas are as nearly equal as 
possible. Thus, we form the sum ȂYm of the effective heights and multi­
ply by 6x. For a function known in analytical form, a value for Ym equal 
to that of the function at the midpoint x; + tu/2 may be calculated and 
used in the summation. 
IT. Trapezoidal [Figure (c)] The areas of the strips are taken to be trap­
ezoids, as shown by the representative strip. The area A, is the average 
height (y; + Y; + 1)12 times 6x. Adding the areas gives the area approxima­
tion as tabulated. For the example with the curvature shown, clearly the 
approximation wil be on the low side. For the reverse curvature, the ap­
proximation wil be on the high side.

III. Parabolic [Figure (d)] The area between the chord and the 
curve (neglected in the trapezoidal solution) may be accounted for by 
approximating the function by a parabola passing through the points 
defined by three successive values ofy. This area may be calculated from 
the geometry of the parabola and added to the trapezoidal area of the 
pair of strips to give the area M of the pair as cited. Adding al of the 
M's produces the tabulation shown, which is known as Simpson's rule. 
To use Simpson's rule, the number n of strips must be even. 
Example: Determine the area under the curve y = x 1 + x2 from x = 0 
to x = 2. (An integrable function is chosen here so that the three 
approximations can be compared with the exact value, which is 
A =  Ju X 1 + x2 dx = lo + v)3121w = lc5 5 - 1) = 3.393 447).

Note that the worst approximation error is less than 2 percent, even 
with only four strips. 
2. Integration of first-order ordinary diferential equations. 
The application of the fundamental principles of mechanics frequently 
results in differential relationships. Let us consider the first-order form 
dyldt = j(t), where the function j(t) may not be readily integrable or 
may be known only in tabular form. We may numerically integrate by 
means of a simple slope-projection technique, known as Euler integra­
tion, which is illustrated in the fi.gure.

Beginning at tl> at which the value y1 is known, we project the slope 
over a horizontal subinterval or step (t2 - t1) and see that y2 = y1 + 
f(t1)(t2 - t1). At t2, the process may be repeated beginning at y2, and so 
forth until the desired value of t is reached. Hence, the general expres­
sion is 
lfy versus t were linear, i.e., if f(t) were constant, the method would 
be exact, and there would be no need for a numerical approach in that 
case. Changes in the slope over the subinterval introduce error. For the 
case shown in the figure, the estimate y2 is clearly less than the true 
value of the function y(t) at t2• More accurate integration techniques 
(such as Runge-Kutta methods) take into account changes in the slope 
over the subinterval and thus provide better results. 
As with the area-determination techniques, experience is helpful in 
the selection of a subinterval or step size when dealing with analytical 
functions. As a rough rule, one begins with a relatively large step size 
and then steadily decreases the step size until the corresponding 
changes in the integrated result are much smaller than the desired ac­
curacy. A step size which is too small, however, can result in increased 
error due to a very large number of computer operations. This type of 
error is generally known as "round-off error," while the error which re­
sults from a large step size is known as algorithm error. 
Example: For the differential equation dyld t = 5t with the initial condi­
tion y = 2 when t = 0, determine the value of y for t = 4. 
Application of the Eule.r integration technique yields the following 
results:
