Dedication
This book is dedicated to Bob Kimball, who made it possible for me to focus 
on writing it. He built the structures in the book and helped me translate the 
steps into writing. But mostly he kept the farm going and the goats fed and 
happy while I gave most of my attention to this project. I couldn’t have done 
it without him. 
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would never have gotten goats had it not been for Simone Delaty, who 
showed me her goats and shared her goat cheese with me one evening in 
1988 on her farm in Wellman, Iowa. Farming was already in my blood (both 
parents came from Iowa farms), but that event led me to the path I would ulti-
mately take.
I have been fortunate during my years as a goat owner to have a great com-
munity of other goat owners who shared their knowledge and experience 
with me. My number-one mentor, Stacy Morris, deserves a special thank-you 
for always being willing to share her wisdom. Stacy also served as the techni-
cal editor for the book, and I appreciate her time and expertise.
I also want to give a special thank-you to my acquisitions editor, Erin Calligan 
Mooney, for fi nding me to write this book and working with me on the pre-
liminary proposal. Thanks to Barbara Frake and Kathryn Born for the illus-
trations that so aptly show you what the text describes. Last but not least, 
thanks to Traci Cumbay, my project editor, for guiding me through the pro-
cess. We made a great team!

Introduction
W
elcome to Raising Goats For Dummies. Raising goats is a rewarding 
and challenging adventure. Whether you are new to it or have been 
raising goats for a few years, you never quit find out about or being delighted 
by these intelligent creatures.
I wrote this book to help you get started successfully raising goats and to 
answer any questions that you have. Whether you’re raising goats for fun, 
for companionship, or to add value to your farm and your lifestyle, this book 
gets you on the right track.
About This Book
I took ten years between thinking about getting some goats and actually 
getting them. I had to get a place where I could keep them and then try to 
figure out what I wanted and what I was getting into. After I actually became a 
goat owner, I had to figure out a lot through trial and error.
I needed a book that laid out the basics, gave me tips on what to look for, 
what to expect, and how to avoid some of the most common pitfalls. This 
book does that. It gives you the basic information you need to make the 
intelligent decisions required to successfully raise goats and helps you avoid 
making mistakes that have a negative effect on their lives and yours.
Even if you’ve been raising goats for a few years, this book can help you. You 
find new ideas on how to keep your goats healthy and happy. And you find 
out how you can use the goats you have to become more self-sufficient. This 
book is for anyone who wants to raise goats.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions throughout the text to make things consistent 
and easy to understand:
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
✓ New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.

2
Raising Goats For Dummies 
 
✓ Bold highlights the action parts of numbered steps and key words in 
bullet lists. 
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, no extra characters like hyphens 
indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book, as though the line break doesn’t exist.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I made some assumptions about who you, the reader 
might be. I assume that you
 
✓ Are already planning to get some goats or have a few and want to find 
out more about caring for them
 
✓ Are interested in the basics of raising goats for milk, meat, fiber, or pets
 
✓ Want to grow some of your own food so you can control the quality and 
what goes into it
 
✓ Don’t know much about goat health care and plan to work with a 
veterinarian when your goats get sick
 
✓ Want to save money by building some of structures and supplies your 
goats need
What You’re Not to Read
The beauty of Raising Goats For Dummies is that you don’t have to read the 
whole book to come away with quite a bit of easily applicable information. 
You can skip the shaded boxes of text called sidebars, which contain stories 
or examples that relate to information in the chapter. Sidebars help you 
connect more with some of the ideas in the chapter, but they don’t contain 
new ideas and so are skippable. 
How This Book Is Organized
This is a reference book, organized so that you can find what’s relevant to 
you without starting at the beginning and reading all the way through. The 
upcoming sections let you know what you find where.

 Introduction
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats
Before you run out and buy some goats, take the time to learn the basics. In 
this part of the book, I introduce you to goats, telling you about the many 
ways that goats can help you, and running through goat terminology and the 
goat parts you need to know. You get a sense of what makes a goat a goat — 
the normal behavior you can expect (which doesn’t include eating cans).
You also find descriptions of the different categories and breeds of goats so 
that you start to figure out which goat may meet your needs. And I tell you 
how to get ready for goats, explaining the steps you take to make sure your 
goats will be safe and happy on your property.
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home
Part II is where you discover where to find the goats you want, how to make 
sure they’re healthy, and how to ensure that your purchase gives you what 
you want with a contract. I help you prepare to bring your goats home, 
outlining all the stuff you need to care for your goats and the steps you take 
to maintain them.
Goats have distinct personalities, and in this part you find out what to expect 
from your goats. I show you how to work with them and how to teach them a 
few basic and advanced skills.
Part III: Glimpsing Goat 
Health and Breeding
You can prevent problems in goats with a little foresight and care. This 
section guides you through steps you take to keep your goats healthy. I show 
you which records you need to keep and give you the lowdown on common 
testing and immunizations. I also equip you with knowledge about common 
goat health problems so that you know what to watch for.
Your healthy goats will have some healthy urges along the way, and this part 
of the book details the breeding, pregnancy, and kidding processes.

Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making 
Money from Your Goats
Here’s where you find out about working in partnership with your goats to 
save or make money. You find out here about milking your goats and making 
and selling products from the milk. You can also turn to this part to find out 
about caring for meat goats and to get ideas for using your goats to live 
sustainably or produce income.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This section is packed with tips, facts, and recipes to supplement your goat 
knowledge. You find out about mistakes first-time goat owners tend to make 
and get pointers for showing your goats like a pro. I dispel ten myths about 
goats. I also give you my all-time favorite goat milk recipes.
Icons Used in the Book
Throughout this book, little pictures in the margins draw your attention to 
special types of information that make your reading experience more helpful. 
Here’s what you find:
 
Some information bears repeating, and I highlight it with this icon. Important 
points that you may turn to again and again appear next to it.
 
The information you find next to this icon is more detailed than usual. When 
you see it, feel free to move on. You won’t lose out on main points.
 
Beside this icon are nuggets of important information that help you to be a 
better goatkeeper. I use this icon to show you ways to save time or money — 
or both.
 
This dangerous-looking icon draws your attention to potential bad outcomes 
or mistakes that you want to avoid. Pay close attention to them.

 Introduction
Where to Go from Here
Pick a chapter, any chapter. Each one is its own little book. You won’t 
need to go back to fill in missing pieces from earlier chapters. Looking for 
information about what to expect from kidding? Turn to Chapter 13. Want to 
glimpse the details of caring for goats? Chapter 9 has what you need. And if 
you’re an overachiever or just insatiably curious, by all means turn the page 
and keep going until you get to the back cover.
I imagine that the more you find out about goats, the more likely you are to 
fall in love with them. They’re smart, curious, and calming, and they can even 
help you make some money. So welcome to the world of goats. I’m grateful 
for the opportunity to help you on your quest.

In this part . . .
H
ere’s where you discover the basics about the 
remarkable goat. See why you’d want goats and the 
benefits they can provide; figure out how to identify a 
healthy goat; run through the different breeds you might 
choose from; and find out how you prepare to bring them 
home.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Joys of 
Raising Goats
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out about the many benefits of raising goats
▶ Getting to know these lovable animals
▶ Deciding whether goatkeeping is for you
I
’ve been raising goats since 1998, and I’m still not tired of them. In fact, I 
can’t imagine my life without them. Talk to any other serious goatkeepers 
and you hear that after they get “in your blood” you have to have at least a 
couple.
When you get a sense of goats’ many uses and get to know their unique 
qualities, goats will get in your blood, too. Goats are more than livestock, 
they’re friends and helpmates, and they’re entertaining as heck.
Goats have been called the poor man’s cow but a better name for them 
would be the “green” cow. They take up less space, cost less to feed, and 
even contribute less to global warming because they don’t emit as much 
methane gas. On top of all that, they’re smart, friendly, and easy to manage 
with the proper set-up. This chapter introduces you to the benefits of raising 
goats and lets you know what you can expect from the experience.
Finding Goat Basics
Goats are intelligent and friendly animals. They come in all sizes (but only 
one shape) and can help you in numerous ways. After you decide what you 
want to accomplish with them, you have a lot of breeds to choose from. (All 
goat owners have their favorite, which they can talk about endlessly.) Check 
out Chapter 3 for a rundown of goat breeds.

10
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Goats are unique animals within the ruminant classification. Ruminants are 
also known as “cud-chewing” animals, or as having four stomachs. You can 
find out more about their digestive systems in Chapter 2, as well as how to 
tell them from sheep, what makes a healthy goat, and how goats communicate 
with you and each other.
Being responsible for goats is a serious undertaking. I say “goats” because 
goats need a herd to be happy, so you shouldn’t get just one goat. You can 
read more about why you need at least two goats and other ways to keep 
them happy in Part II.
These critters can live for seven years or more, so getting goats is like getting 
a dog — you may be taking care of them for quite a while. Chapter 2 tells you 
about their life expectancy.
Glimpsing the Benefits of Owning Goats
Goats are fantastic animals that have been domesticated for more than 
10,000 years. You get a lot from a relatively small animal — you can milk 
them or eat their meat, use their fiber and their skin for making clothing, and 
even use their dung for fuel (if you are so inclined). In the past, goat hide was 
made into bags for carrying water and wine and parchment for writing on; it 
is still used to make drums in some countries.
You may want to raise goats for a variety of reasons. Whatever brings you to 
goats, you’re guaranteed to find additional benefits to owning these critters 
after you start working with them.
Thank goats for coffee
According to legend, goats in the charge of an 
Ethiopian goatherd named Kaldi failed to return 
one evening. When he found them the next 
morning, they were excited and dancing next to 
a shrub covered in red berries. He investigated, 
trying the berries, and discovered that they 
were responsible for the goats’ excitement. The 
goats had discovered coffee.
When the goatherd took the berries to the 
town monastery, the abbot disapproved and 
threw them into the fire. When he smelled the 
pleasant odor they gave out as they roasted, he 
raked them out of the fire, ground them up, and 
mixed them with water. Coffee’s use as a stimu-
lant drink gradually spread around the world.
Goats still enjoy coffee, and some goat owners 
use it to stimulate labor and give energy to a 
doe that is kidding.

11
 Chapter 1: Discovering the Joys of Raising Goats
Becoming more self-sufficient
Goats are not only a great way to become more self-sufficient — they can give 
you milk to drink and food to eat, and even help you carry your belongings 
when backpacking — but they teach you in a very direct way where your 
food comes from and give you an opportunity to affect its quality. If prices go 
up (and don’t they always?) you are less affected if you’re supplying some of 
your own food.
And imagine not ever having to cut down blackberries or kudzu again. You 
can get your friendly goat to do it for you, while growing fiber for hats and 
sweaters and providing you with milk, meat, and even more goats.
In this section I talk about the many ways goats can contribute and move you 
toward self-sufficiency.
Cutting your dairy bill
Imagine never having to buy milk or cheese again. If you raise dairy goats 
you can achieve that goal. Your goats need to have kids to give you milk, and 
then you can milk them throughout the year for up to three years without 
re-breeding, if you want. Or you can stagger the kidding each year so that you 
have a milk supply year-round. (They need a break from milking during the 
last two months of their pregnancy to put their energy into growing kids.)
You need only a few goats to keep a small family in milk and other dairy 
products. Just one standard-size dairy goat can give you an average of 6 to 8 
pounds (3 to 4 quarts) of milk each day. And, depending on the butterfat content 
of the milk, you can get up to a pound of cheese for every gallon of milk.
With your own milk supply, you won’t need to worry about additives to 
the milk you drink or the cheese or yogurt you eat. Goat milk is easier to 
digest than cow milk, and so it is prized by people who can’t drink cow milk. 
Depending on the state you live in, you can sell milk to supplement your 
income or offset the goats’ feed costs.
You find out about raising goats for milk in Chapter 14.
Raising your own meat
Goat meat has always been popular in the developing world, because goats 
are much more affordable and use fewer resources than animals such as 
cows. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the demand for goat 
meat is expected to continue growing.

12
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
People who moved to the United States from Latin America, the Caribbean, 
the Middle East, Asia, and Africa brought their custom of eating goat meat 
as a regular part of their diet and still want it. And more people who hadn’t 
eaten goat meat before are willing to try a new, lean source of protein that 
doesn’t have the taint of confined animal farming operations (CAFOs). 
Animals raised in CAFOs often never see the light of day and are unable to 
exercise or eat grass because they are packed into small areas.
Goat meat is easily digestible, tasty, and low in fat. If you’re in charge of your 
own source of meat, you know how it was raised and what feed or medications 
went into it.
Meat goat farming provides a great opportunity to start a business or 
supplement your income. You can raise goats that are bred for meat, or you 
can use your excess dairy wethers or bucks as an alternative to buying meat 
or to provide income to support your herd. Before you jump into a meat-goat 
enterprise thinking that you’re going to get rich, you need to investigate a few 
things:
 
✓ Check out the market for goat meat in the area of the country where 
you live.
 
 You can contact your extension office for assistance, go to the local 
livestock auction to see how well and for what price meat goats are 
selling, and read the local agriculture newspaper or other publications 
to see what they have to say about raising and marketing meat goats.
 
✓ Learn about stocking (the number of animals you can support without 
overcrowding or overgrazing), how many goats you can stock on your 
property, and how that might break down in terms of income.
 
✓ Determine what kind of meat goats are available and for what price.
Drinking milk on the farm may 
help you breathe easier
A number of studies have shown a positive 
correlation between living on a farm and not 
having allergies or asthma. One study goes 
even further, showing a likely benefit of raising 
goats for their milk.
A 2006 study of nearly 5,000 rural children 
aged 5 through 13 from various European 
countries found that those who drank milk on 
the farm were less likely to have asthma, hay 
fever, or other allergies than those who didn’t. 
At least half of the children were known to 
drink raw milk, but the researchers didn’t have 
enough information to determine whether the 
protective effect was related to raw milk or just 
on-farm dairy products in general.

13
 Chapter 1: Discovering the Joys of Raising Goats
 
✓ Consider slaughter options. Would you slaughter goats yourself, sell 
them at auction, have a mobile slaughter provider come out, or transport 
your goats to a slaughterhouse? Do you have a vehicle to transport 
goats? Is there a USDA-certified slaughter facility nearby that handles 
goats? Factors affecting this decision include laws governing slaughter 
as well as the local market, your capabilities, and financial considerations.
I talk in much more detail about raising goats for meat in Chapter 15.
Growing your own fiber
Some of the finest fiber comes from goats: Angora and Pygora goats produce 
mohair, cashmere goats produce cashmere, and crosses between the two 
breeds produce a fiber called cashgora. An adult angora goat can produce an 
average of 8 to 16 pounds of mohair each year, and a kid can produce 3 to 5 
pounds. Cashmere and cashgora-producing goats produce less fiber, but it is 
also more highly valued.
If you raise fiber goats, you can spin your own yarn and make hats, blankets, 
sweaters or other products. You can also sell the fiber to spinners or to 
companies that make these products, while having the benefit of these 
friendly creatures.
Check out Chapter 16 to find out about harvesting and using goat fiber.
Harnessing goats’ power as living weed whackers
Goats are well-known for their ability to wipe out weeds. In fact, some people 
have made businesses out of renting out their goat herds to cities and other 
municipalities to clean up areas that are overgrown with weeds or blackberry 
bushes. These leased goats decrease the need to use herbicides, improve the 
soil’s fertility, decrease the risk of fire, increase the diversity of plants in the 
area, and control weeds in hard-to-reach areas, such as steep hills.
 
Because goats are browsers, they can share a pasture with sheep or cattle, 
which prefer different plants. Goats eat brush, leaves, and rough plants. They 
can improve pasture by removing noxious weeds, clear areas to be replanted 
with trees, and control leafy spurge, knapweed, Himalayan blackberry, giant 
ragweed, sunflowers, and other weeds.
 
Not every plant is a great snack for a goat. I tell you about plants you need to 
keep away from your goats in Chapter 4.
Whether your goats are pets, milk producers, or meat animals, they provide 
the side benefit of acting as living weed whackers. With some portable 
fencing or a guardian animal for protection, they range far and wide each day 
to keep your property free of noxious weeds.

14
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Don’t expect to put them on a lawn and have them mow down the grass, 
though. “Lawnmower” is the job of sheep, not goats. Goats prefer to eat your 
rosebushes or lilacs.
Breeding and selling
Unless your goats are just pets or brush eaters, you probably want to breed 
them. If you have dairy goats, you need to breed them to keep a good supply 
of milk flowing. And you need to replace any goats you sell or slaughter.
As a dairy goat owner, I supplement my income from selling milk and selling 
kids by selling kids and providing buck service. Buck service means leasing a 
buck for breeding purposes to another goat owner. Buck service is valuable 
to goat owners who don’t have the space or don’t want the hassle of keeping 
a buck or who want to get certain genetics into their herd. I tell you more 
about buck service, and about breeding in general, in Chapter 12.
Using goats for companions or helpers
Goats make great companions, something that more people discover every 
day. Miniature goats such as the Nigerian Dwarf, Pygmy, and mini dairy 
breeds are growing in popularity as pets, in both the city and the country. 
(Check out Chapter 3 to find out more about these and other breeds.)
Goats are intelligent and funny, and they’re also a great way to meet people. I 
had a little goat named Malakai, who was a dwarf Nigerian Dwarf, because of 
health issues. His petite size made him all the more adorable. He was house- 
and car-broken, and so I took him with me wherever I went. He was the little 
Mystic Acres farm emissary and never failed to attract people. Besides 
Cashmere goats
No specific breed of goat is named cashmere. 
The term refers to the undercoat or down that 
is harvested from a variety of goats. Cashmere 
is harvested and processed mainly in central 
Asia, especially China. The fiber produced by 
up to four of these Asian feral goats in a whole 
year is required to make just one cashmere 
sweater — which explains why they are so 
expensive.
Feral goats in Australia, New Zealand, and the 
United States produce down fiber that meets 
the cashmere specifications, but production 
from most of these goats is low. Breeders have 
produced more productive cashmere goats by 
selectively breeding good producers from the 
feral population, including the Spanish goat in 
the United States. Cashmeres have the added 
benefit of being good meat goats.

15
 Chapter 1: Discovering the Joys of Raising Goats
helping me meet people, Malakai gave me the opportunity to educate people 
about goats and clarify their inevitable misunderstandings. (Get into goats, 
and you’ll find that misconceptions abound. I brace you to take on the most 
common of them in Chapter 19.)
Keeping goats as pets
 
Normally considered livestock, goats can make good pets, but you will be 
much more satisfied using them for this purpose if you remember that they 
are outdoor animals and that’s where they do best. Goats are herd animals 
and need another goat for a friend, so get at least two of them. I tell you more 
about choosing your goats in Chapter 5.
You can leash train goats and take them on walks throughout the neighborhood 
or around your property, which provides exercise for all of you. (Chapter 8 
shows you how to get started leash-training.) I can tell you from experience 
that just sitting and watching goats has a calming effect. Studies of other pets 
have shown that they can lower your heart rate and improve your health — 
and I’m sure that the same is true for goats as pets.
Finding a helping hoof: Using your goat for packing
Goats are social animals and, after you establish a relationship with them, 
they love to spend time with you. They enjoy going for hikes and can go 
almost anywhere you can. Not only that, but they can carry your belongings, 
they find plenty to eat right there in the wilderness, and they make great 
companions.
So why not take your goat packing? Ideally, you select a large wether for 
packing and then take the time to train him to obey commands and to carry 
your gear. Goats are surefooted, excellent pack animals and can help you 
work, whether it be gathering wood in the forest or just carrying your 
belongings on a holiday hike. Chapter 8 tells you about training your goat as 
a pack animal.
Sharing your goat with others
Another way you can use a companion or pet goat is as a therapy animal or a 
visitor to children, seniors, or other groups who don’t usually see goats. After 
you train your goats, you can approach teachers, administrators, or activity 
directors to plan a goat day (or hour). You get to spend time with your goats, 
and other people get to learn about their unique personalities.
Some people use goats to help children with autism improve their sensory 
abilities and social skills — there’s nothing like a cute pet to get people 
talking to you — and to improve morale and entertain residents of nursing 
homes. (I talk more about these benefits in Chapter 16.)

16
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Raising goats as a 4-H project
Getting children involved in raising goats is a good way to teach responsibility. 
Keeping goats requires twice-a-day chores. Children quickly learn that the 
goats depend on them. They also find out about the cycle of birth and death 
and get outdoors to get regular exercise.
 
Learning about and caring for goats as a 4-H project provides a structure that 
makes caring for goats fun and easy by giving the project a bigger purpose. 
Contact your county extension office for help on finding a 4-H group. If the 4-H 
group in your area is not set up so your kids can raise goats for a project, 
consider getting trained and starting your own goat 4-H group. Doing so not 
only gives your kids the opportunity for such a project, but it teaches 
responsibility, helps promote goats, and educates other children.
Some of the things that children can do in a goat 4-H project include the 
following:
 
✓ Developing a budget for goat care
 
✓ Writing a report on and giving a speech about goats
 
✓ Demonstrating hoof-trimming or other routine care (Chapter 9)
 
✓ Watching a goat show
 
✓ Exhibiting the goat at the county or state fair (Chapter 16)
 
✓ Milking the goat and making cheese or yogurt (Chapter 14)
 
✓ Training the goat to walk on a lead (Chapter 8)
 
✓ Writing or drawing for a goat newsletter or magazine
Determining Whether Goats Are for You
You may love goats and the idea of raising them, but how do you know 
whether raising goats is right for you?
The first order of business is finding out everything you can about goats. You 
get a good start by reading this book. I also recommend that you spend time 
around goats. Ask goat people you’ve met whether you can go to their farms 
and observe or even help with their goats. Firsthand experience gives you an 
idea of what goats need and how you like working with them.
 
Goats can live 15 years, or even longer. Unless you buy goats to be eaten, and 
especially if you plan to keep them as pets, remember that you’re taking on a 
long-term commitment just like you do when you get a dog or a cat.

17
 Chapter 1: Discovering the Joys of Raising Goats
The upcoming sections tell you more about considerations you need to mull 
over before you become a goat owner.
Devoting time and effort
Expect to spend at least a half hour each morning and a half hour each 
evening on routine goat care. If you get a lot of goats or use them for a 
specialty such as milk, meat, or fiber, you need to budget more time. (Part IV 
tells you about each of these situations.)
Goats need a supply of hay and/or browse (grasses and other plants they 
can find in a pasture) and clean water at all times. (Chapter 6 gives you the 
details on what goats eat.) The routine twice-daily care you need to plan for 
includes feeding, changing water, cleaning buckets, observing your goats to 
make sure they are healthy and acting normal, making sure they’re safe and 
secure each night, and letting them out in the morning. Of course, you 
probably want to spend more time just being with them after you discover 
how fascinating they are.
Plan also to spend an hour or more each month on regular grooming and 
goat care such as hoof trimming, injections or other treatment, and cleaning 
their living area. (Chapter 8 runs through the routine care that goats need.) 
If you breed, show, shear, or slaughter your goats, you spend many more 
hours with your goats intermittently. And if one of your goats gets sick, you 
need time to provide care or coordinate with a vet. (Chapter 11 addresses 
common illnesses.)
 
If you work and don’t have a reliable helper, you need to have some flexibility 
to deal with problems. If you work outside your home and have long or erratic 
hours, a helper is essential.
Deciding which goats are 
right for your situation
You want to get the type of goat that’s right for your goals. If you want goats 
for milk, get dairy goats; for meat, get meat goats; for fiber, get fiber goats. 
If you have mixed goals, find out which animal will best suit all of them. For 
example, a Spanish goat can produce cashmere, kids for meat, and milk. 
The milk won’t be of the volume or quality you get with a dairy goat, but 
nevertheless, it’s milk. You can read more about the different breeds in 
Chapter 3.

18
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
 
If you want pet goats, choose goats that are
 
✓ Tame and friendly: These goats are much easier to work with, and you 
won’t have to spend time trying to get them to trust you.
 
✓ Horn-free: Goats without horns are the safest, especially around children. 
(I tell you more about the horns, including how to remove them, in 
Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Wethers: A wether is a buck that has been castrated. (See Chapter 2 for 
more about goat terminology.) Don’t ever accept or buy a buck goat for 
a pet. You will regret it as soon as he matures and starts to stink during 
breeding season. (Chapter 12 tells you about the weird and exciting 
world of breeding.) Does can make okay pets, but wethers are the best. 
They don’t go into heat, and they cost less to feed because they don’t 
need anything but minerals and good grass hay. They also are the 
sweetest.
If you live in a city, get miniature goats, not full-sized ones. They won’t take 
up as much room and then you can have more, if you want. By the same 
token, if you have a physical disability, miniature goats are better because 
they are easier to handle. You can read more about miniature goat breeds in 
Chapter 3.
Finding out about local ordinances
Check out ordinances in your area regarding keeping livestock. These govern 
whether you can keep livestock and restrict the types you can keep. You 
need to be aware of the ordinances governing your area, or you risk losing 
the goats that you dreamed of getting just because of a technicality.
For example, you may need to buy a license for a goat, just like you do for 
a dog. In some cities, you can’t keep backyard goats, so if you want to raise 
them you need to work with the powers that be to get the law revised, like 
other urban farmers are doing in cities around the United States.
In some cases where goats are prohibited by a city or other municipality, 
people with special needs or medical issues have been able to obtain variances 
to the zoning so that a goat could serve as a service or therapy animal.
Another kind of ordinance that you need to be aware of governs noise. In 
rural areas animals are expected (as are guns), so neighbors can’t do much 
legally about a crying goat (or target-shooting). But in an urban area, even if 
goats are allowed, your neighbors may complain, much like they do with a 
barking dog. Be aware of what your local noise ordinance covers.

19
 Chapter 1: Discovering the Joys of Raising Goats
Knowing your neighbors
Even more important is to know your neighbors. Do they have any vicious or 
out-of-control dogs that may be a threat to your goats? Can you keep these 
dogs away from your goats?
Do you already have bad blood with neighbors? Will they bitterly complain, 
undermine you, or otherwise make your life miserable if they hear goat 
cries? If you live in an area where you’ll need a livestock guardian dog, will 
neighbors have a problem with nighttime barking? Try to work things out 
first, but if you can’t, think about whether you want to invest a lot of time, 
money, and heart in a project where a nearby neighbor will make your life 
difficult.
 
After you get goats, share some of your goat products with your neighbors, 
consider involving them or their children in your project, and work with them 
to make sure your goats aren’t causing a problem.

G
oats are interesting and amazing animals. They’re related to sheep, 
deer, and cattle but have some basic differences. Talking about goats 
and their various parts requires you to pick up some new vocabulary.
In this chapter, I give you an introduction to goat terminology, take you 
through body parts that are integral to “goatness,” and give you some tips 
on what to expect from a healthy goat and how to tell whether things are 
starting to go wrong.
Doe, a Goat, a Female Goat
If you want to get goats, you need to talk goats with other goat lovers. To 
help you avoid missteps, here is the basic terminology that you need to ask 
questions and talk about goats knowledgeably:
 
✓ Doe: A female goat. A young doe is called a doeling.
 
 You may have heard a female goat called a nanny. But don’t use that 
term unless you want to offend someone. Some meat goat owners still 
call their does nannies, but the more common term these days is doe, 
especially if you’re getting dairy goats.
 
✓ Buck: A male goat. A young buck is called a buckling.
 
 Like nanny goat, billy is also considered a negative term for a male goat, 
bringing to mind a scruffy, stinking animal. Some meat goat owners still 
use this term, but in order not to offend, use buck instead.
 
✓ Brood doe: A doe that is kept and used for breeding purposes, to pass 
on certain desirable genetic traits.

22
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
 
✓ Kid: A baby goat or a goat less than a year old.
 
✓ Yearling: A goat that is between one and two years old.
 
✓ Wether: A castrated male goat.
 
✓ Herd: A group of goats. Sheep are in flocks; goats are in herds.
 
✓ Ruminant: An animal that has a stomach with four compartments and 
chews cud as part of the digestive process. Goats are ruminants.
 
✓ Udder: The organ in a goat that produces milk. Don’t call it a bag. Goats 
have only one udder.
 
✓ Teat: The protuberance from the udder that you use to milk a goat. 
Goats have two teats.
 
✓ Dam: A goat’s mother.
 
✓ Sire: A goat’s father. You can also say that a goat sired a kid.
Taking a Look at Goat Anatomy
Goats are mammals and are similar to other mammals in some ways. But they 
also have unique features that indicate whether they are healthy, tell you 
how old they are, and even give clues about their parents.
In this section, I tell you about different parts of the goat, how to tell a goat’s 
age by its teeth, and how to tell a goat from a sheep. (Some of them do look 
similar.)
Parts of the body
You can own goats and not know the names of parts of the body. But if you 
want to have an intelligent discussion with other goat aficionados or show 
your goats, knowing the correct terminology is essential.
Figure 2-1 shows you the names of the different parts of a goat. Some are 
obvious — we all can identify an ear or a neck. But others may be new to 
you if you haven’t raised animals before. Here are some terms for different 
body parts:
 
✓ Cannon bone: The shin bone.
 
✓ Chine: The area of the spine directly behind the withers.
 
✓ Escutcheon: The area between the back legs, where the udder lies in a 
doe. This area should be wide in a dairy goat.

23
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
 
✓ Pastern: The flexible part of the lower leg below the dewclaw and above 
the hoof.
 
✓ Pinbone: The hip bone.
 
✓ Stifle joint: The equivalent of the knee in a goat.
 
✓ Thurl: The hip joint, usually referred to in relation to the levelness 
between the thurls.
 
✓ Withers: The shoulder area or area of the spine where the shoulder 
blades meet at the base of the neck. You measure from this point to the 
ground to determine a goat’s height.

The digestive system
Goats are ruminants, which means that they have four stomach compart-
ments and part of their digestive process includes regurgitating partially 
digested food and chewing it, called ruminating. This kind of digestive system 
needs a plant-based diet.
Understanding a goat’s digestive system and the how it works helps you keep 
your herd healthy or identify potential problems.
 
The goat stomach consists of three forestomachs — the rumen, reticulum, and 
omasum — and a true stomach, the abomasum. (See Figure 2-2.) The forestom-
achs are responsible for grinding and digesting hay, with the help of bacteria. 
The last compartment, the abomasum, is similar to the human stomach and 
digests most proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

system.

Abomasum
(true stomach)
Each stomach compartment has a different function, and they all work 
together:
 
✓ The rumen is the largest of the forestomachs, with a 1- to 2-gallon capac-
ity. It is a large fermentation vat that has bacteria living in it. These 
microorganisms break down roughage, such as hay. Then the goat 
regurgitates the partially broken-down material, chews it as a cud, and 
then swallows it.
 
 This repetitive process, rumination, creates methane gas as a byprod-
uct. Methane is the cause of the strong-smelling belches that you can 
expect from a goat with a healthy rumen. A goat that can’t belch has 
bloat. (See Chapter 11 for signs and treatment of bloat.) The rumen 
action also creates heat, much like a compost pile, which helps a goat 
stay warm.
 
✓ The reticulum is in front of and below the rumen, near the liver; the 
reticulum and the rumen work together to initially break down the food. 
Rumen contractions push the smaller particles of partially digested food 
into the rumen and heavier pieces into the reticulum. Then the reticu-
lum contracts and sends the partially digested food into the mouth as a 
cud for chewing.

25
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
 
 This process continues until the pieces are small enough to pass 
through to the omasum. The reticulum also catches harmful things, such 
as wire or nails, that a goat accidentally swallows. (See Chapter 11.)
  
✓ After fermentation and rumination break down the roughage, it moves 
through the reticulum to the omasum, where enzymes further digest it. 
The omasum has long tissue folds whose function is to help remove fluid 
and decrease the size of food particles that come out of the rumen.
 
✓ The abomasum is the only compartment that produces digestive 
enzymes. It completes the next step in the digestive process of food that 
forestomachs partially broke down. The abomasum handles the pri-
mary digestion of grain and milk, which don’t need rumen bacteria to be 
digested. The products of this part of digestion pass into the intestine 
for final breakdown, separating waste products from usable fats and 
proteins.
Hooves
A hoof is the horny sheath that covers the lower part of a goat’s foot and is 
divided into two parts. Goats stand on their hooves and walk on them to get 
around, which makes them extremely important.
 
When something goes wrong with a hoof, the rest of the musculoskeletal 
system is affected, which can cause pain, limping, lameness, and a shorter 
lifespan.
Because they don’t like to stand in one place to eat, goats don’t do well if 
they have to lie around or walk on their knees. (Yes, knees.) I recently saw 
goats on television whose owners had fed them well but apparently hadn’t 
trimmed their hooves for years. (Chapter 9 tells you how to trim hooves.) 
The goats’ hooves were almost a foot long and curled up at the ends. 
Consequently, many of them couldn’t even walk, and others walked on their 
knees, dragging their rear feet. That had to hurt!
Untrimmed hooves make a goat prone to foot scald or rot, which can ulti-
mately kill a goat. (See Chapter 11 for more on foot rot.) Goats’ hooves do 
best in dry, rocky climates. Goats that are feral or were feral for years, such 
as the Spanish goat, need less hoof care than closely bred, farmed goats.
 
A proper goat hoof is rhomboid-shaped (not rectangular, but slightly longer in 
the front than in the back) and has no overgrowth on the sides or front. Trim 
your goats hooves regularly to ensure that they maintain this shape.

26
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Teeth
Goats have lower teeth in the front of their mouths but only a hard pad on 
the top. They also have back teeth on both top and bottom, which you will 
painfully discover if you put your finger into the back of a goat’s mouth! The 
back teeth are used for cud-chewing.
Baby goats get their first teeth before birth, at around 98 to 105 days of gesta-
tion. They lose these baby teeth, just like other mammals. You can generally 
determine the age of a goat by looking at the eight teeth in the goat’s lower 
front jaw. This is called toothing a goat.
Toothing a goat is not completely accurate because you can find variances 
among goats. They may lose some teeth and grow new ones at different 
times, or their diet or health can influence how their teeth grow. Figure 2-3 
shows you goats’ teeth at various stages.

You can tell 
a goat’s age 
by its teeth.

and older)

27
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
Here’s a guide to toothing a goat:
 
✓ First year (kid): Baby teeth are small and sharp. They gradually fall out 
and permanent teeth replace them.
 
✓ Second year (yearling): The two middle front teeth fall out when the kid 
is about 12 months old. Two larger permanent teeth grow in their place.
 
✓ Third year: The teeth next to the two middle teeth fall out. Two new, 
larger, permanent teeth grow in when the kid is about 24 months old.
 
✓ Fourth year: The next two teeth on either side of the four middle teeth 
fall out, and new permanent teeth grow in.
 
✓ Fifth year: The goat has all eight front teeth.
 
 After five years, you can guess at the goat’s age by looking for wear on 
the teeth and missing teeth. This will vary a lot, depending on the goat’s 
diet.
Beards
Most but not all goats have beards. The male’s beard is more majestic than 
the female’s beard. Although the purpose of the beard is unknown, it’s 
great for capturing that unique scent that males like to flaunt during breed-
ing season. If you’re having trouble telling whether an animal is a goat or 
a sheep, look for a beard — only goats have them. (But not all goats have 
them.) Table 2-1 tells you more about distinguishing goats from sheep.
Wattles
A wattle is a fleshy decoration that hangs from the goat’s neck just past 
where the chin attaches. Wattles are more common in dairy goats and pygmy 
goats. Most goats have two, although I have had a goat born with only one. 
They are a genetic trait — at least one parent has to have wattles for a kid to 
be born with them.
Eyes
A goat’s pupil is rectangular rather than round like other animals’. A lot of 
people say they are creeped out by goat’s eyes, but according to the Los 
Angeles zoo, they have an important function. Goats have excellent night 
vision, which enables them to avoid predators and browse at night. I can 
vouch for the night browsing, although my goats are out at night eating under 
a full moon more often than any other time.

28
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Goats’ eye color ranges from yellow to brown to blue. Angora goats some-
times inherit a condition where facial hair covers their eyes, which harms 
their vision and their ability to browse.

Signs of a Healthy Goat
One of the most important parts of being a goat owner is observing the goats 
to make sure that they’re healthy. You can do it when you’re feeding, or just 
go out and watch them. The bonus is that hanging out with goats is relaxing! 
I’m lucky to work from home and be able to incorporate “goat breaks” into 
my routine.
A healthy goat has shiny eyes and glossy hair, and is curious and energetic 
unless resting and chewing cud. If you’re watching your goats and one of 
them seems a bit off, you can take a few simple steps to investigate further. 
In this section, I tell you what’s normal for goats and give you some simple 
clues to determine whether your goat is healthy.
Noticing posture
One of the first signs of a healthy goat is posture. A healthy goat usually has 
her head and tail up, stands erect, and holds her ears erect. That doesn’t 
mean that every time a goat has her tail or ears down that she is sick. It is 
just a sign to be taken in conjunction with other signs. A goat that doesn’t 
feel well will hunch with tail down and not be as responsive to external stim-
uli such as sounds or physical activity.

29
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
 
A goat with an upset stomach, bloat, or urinary calculi (see Chapter 11) will 
stretch out repeatedly, trying to relieve the pressure or discomfort or trying 
to pee. This abnormal posture is a sign that you need to check out the goat 
immediately.
Observe your goats when they’re healthy and note how they stand and move, 
how they interact and how they look overall. Any change is your first clue 
that something might be wrong.
Identifying the meaning of goat cries
People with new goats often ask whether something is wrong with goats 
because they cry every time they see a person move. I advise them not to 
respond to the goats every time they cry. Often they were just spoiled by 
their prior owner or are a breed known for being noisy, such as Nubian or 
Nigerian Dwarf. (Chapter 3 tells you about goat breeds.) Or they are grieving 
the loss of their mother or other herd members.
I had a goat whose baby died during birth and had to be removed from her 
body. She saw the dead kid at the vet’s office, but after she got home she ran 
to the kidding pen, looking around and then started yelling at me. She recov-
ered physically from the ordeal but took months to get over it emotionally. 
Some goats whose babies are taken at birth for bottle-feeding (usually dairy 
goats) or die later respond the same way, while others seem unconcerned.
If a goat is truly hungry or thirsty, his bleat is persistent. I always hear these 
cries as my wake-up call in the morning if I’m not out by 7:00 am and in the 
evening at the same time. They know they’re due to be fed. Who needs a tra-
ditional alarm clock?
A sick goat sometimes moans or makes a stressed-out sounding cry, but 
more often you notice that she isn’t crying but is away from the herd suffer-
ing silently.
Bucks in rut will make some of the craziest snorting, bleating noises you’ve 
ever heard. Some does cry out in little short bursts when they’re in heat and 
wanting to get bred.
Does that are kidding can also be quite noisy, although some approach the 
task silently. During the first stage of labor, they whine more than cry, espe-
cially if they want you there with them the whole time. Others are pretty dis-
creet until it’s time to push the baby out and then they let loose with a loud, 
long cry to tell you over the baby monitor that it’s time.

30
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Finally, a goat that is trapped or injured (or got through the fence and can’t 
get back in) will make sure you know it with loud, frantic bleats. This is 
the kind of cry that sends you running to its source because time is of the 
essence. If a kid is the victim, the mother will often chime in to let you know 
that something is wrong.
Listen, and learn your goats’ cries; the knowledge will serve you well.
Determining normal temperature
A goat’s normal temperature is around 102 to 103° Fahrenheit but can be 
a degree higher or lower, depending on the individual goat. A goat’s tem-
perature can also go up or down throughout the day. On a hot day, you can 
expect some of your goats to have higher temperatures.
A temperature that is too high or too low indicates illness in a goat. A goat 
with a high temperature often has an infection and can quickly become dehy-
drated, while a goat with a low temperature (hypothermia) may have rumen 
trouble or is so sick that he is unable to stay warm. This goat needs to be 
warmed or he will die.
 
If you have a goat with hypothermia, use a goat coat — a jacket made to fit a 
goat and keep him warm, especially when he’s sick. You can buy one from a 
goat catalog or individual seller online, or you can make one out of a fleece 
blanket or an old sweatshirt. Just cut the blanket so it is big enough to wrap 
around the goat’s body, cut two front leg holes and put it on with the open 
part on the goat’s stomach. If you’re using a sweatshirt, cut through the front 
of the sweatshirt to create an opening at the bottom.
I also have a flat plastic electric warmer that I bought from a pet-supply 
catalog for an old dog. She refused to use it, but it came in really handy for a 
dying doe who couldn’t maintain her body temperature in the cold weather 
despite wearing a goat coat. You can also get swine farrowing mats at live-
stock supply companies in a variety of sizes.
Figuring out what’s normal for your goats
In order to determine what’s normal for each of your goats, take their tem-
perature several times when they’re healthy and note the number in their 
health records. Make sure you measure their temperatures on a hot day and 
a normal day so that you get an accurate baseline to compare with if a goat 
gets sick, as well as an idea of what variations might occur in that goat.
Taking a goat’s temperature
Taking a goat’s temperature is easy. You need either a digital or traditional 
glass thermometer that you can buy from a feed store, a drug store, or a live-
stock supply catalog. Either type is fairly inexpensive.

31
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
 
If you use a glass thermometer, make sure you shake it down before you start 
so that it reads accurately. Tie a string around one end of a glass thermometer 
so that you can retrieve it if it goes too far.
To take a goat’s temperature, grab a thermometer, the goat’s health record, 
and take the following steps:
 
1. Immobilize the goat.
 
 You can hold a small kid across your lap. Secure an adult in a stanchion 
(a metal device to lock a goat’s head in place), have a helper hold him 
still, or tie him to a gate or fence.
 
2. Lubricate your thermometer with KY jelly or petroleum jelly.
 
3. Insert the thermometer a few inches into the goat’s rectum.
 
4. Hold the thermometer in place for at least two minutes.
 
5. Slowly remove the thermometer, read the temperature and record it 
on the goat’s health record.
 
6. Clean the thermometer.
 
 Use an alcohol wipe or a cotton ball that has been wet with alcohol.
Using ruminations as a health indicator
Because rumination is an essential part of how goats digest food (see the 
section “The digestive system”), you can use cud-chewing as an indicator of 
goat health. A ruminating goat is eating and generating heat and energy. You 
can determine whether a goat is ruminating in two ways: by looking for cud-
chewing and by listening to the goat’s body.
A goat’s rumen is located on the left side of the abdomen. You can watch this 
area or feel the side of the abdomen for movement.
The best way to determine whether a goat is ruminating and the strength and 
frequency of rumination is to listen. Often, ruminations are loud enough that 
you can hear them by just sitting next to the goat. If you can’t hear them, put 
your head up to the left side of your goat’s abdomen. If you still have trouble 
hearing ruminations, use a stethoscope. You can purchase an inexpensive 
stethoscope from a livestock supply catalog.
 
Healthy ruminations are loud, sound kind of like a growling stomach, and 
occur about two or three times a minute. If they are weak or infrequent, 
give your goat some roughage and probiotics (“good” microbes given orally 
that protect against disease) to stimulate the rumen and to add to the 
rumen bacteria.

32
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Look around your herd to see whether each goat is chewing its cud. I’ve 
found that a good time for this is the early afternoon, when the goats are rest-
ing before their last go at the pasture for the day. Usually at least two thirds 
of them will be ruminating at the same time. Take a closer look at any goats 
that aren’t chewing cud. If they don’t look well in some other way (see the 
section, “Signs of a healthy goat”), go up to them and listen for rumination 
sounds.
Taking a goat’s pulse
Pulse indicates the goat’s heart rate. Normal pulse for a goat is 70 to 90 beats 
per minute. Kids’ heart rates may be twice that fast. To take your goat’s 
pulse:
 
1. Make sure she is calm and resting.
 
2. Find the goat’s artery below and slightly inside the jaw with your 
fingers.
 
3. Watching a clock, count the number of beats in 15 seconds.
 
4. Multiply that number by four to get the pulse rate.
Counting respirations
The normal respiration rate for an adult goat is 10 to 30 breaths per minute 
and for a kid it is 20 to 40 breaths per minute. To count respirations, simply 
watch the goat’s side when she is calm and resting. Count one respiration for 
each time the goat’s side rises and falls.
Recognizing life expectancy
Goats spend the first three years of their lives growing. They are almost their 
full size at age two, but can still put on weight and height for another year.
Goats’ general life expectancy is about 7 to 12 years. Wethers often live 
longer than does and bucks — over 10 years — probably because they are 
most often pets and have less stressful lives. One of the common causes of 
death in wethers is urinary calculi.
Does live an average of 11 to 12 years. They often die from kidding-related 
problems because of the stress that it puts them under. They are more prone 
to parasite overload and losing condition from feeding kids. Does who aren’t 
bred after about the age of 10 often live longer. I have heard of does living as 
long as 20 years.

33
 Chapter 2: Glimpsing Vital Goat Statistics
Bucks have shorter lives than either wethers or does, living on average 8 to 
10 years. The stresses of annual rut (breeding season; see Chapter 12) take 
their toll on them. They have to deal with other bucks’ aggressions and lack 
of eating and sleeping.
Using a Goat Scorecard 
to Evaluate a Goat
Goat registries use scorecards to evaluate goats that are being shown. These 
vary with the type of goat being evaluated. For example, out of 120 points in 
the Colored Angora goat scorecard, 70 points are for fleece. (See Table 2-1.) 
In the dairy goat scorecard, more focus is put on the mammary system and in 
meat goats, muscle development and growth have more value.
Look on the Internet or write to the registry for the breed you are interested 
in and request a copy of their goat scorecard online and use it to help you 
evaluate and learn about the ideal for that type of goat. The Colored Angora 
Breeders Association (CABGA) includes a sample of a judge’s scorecard on 
its Web site (www.cagba.org/scorecard.pdf).

In This Chapter
▶ Deciding whether you want goats for meat, dairy, fiber, or a combination
▶ Learning the pros and cons of different breeds
▶ Figuring out which breed you want to raise
S
o you want to get goats? You’ve probably already thought about why 
you want goats. So now you need to figure out what kind of goat can 
best serve your purposes.
If you want a goat to eat brush, then your choices are unlimited; you just 
have to figure out what size is best and how many you want. And if you know 
you want goats for just one purpose — milk, meat, or fiber — then the decision 
will be easier and you can just read about those kinds of goats. But what if 
you want a goat for milk and meat? Or fiber and milk? That might make the 
decision a little harder.
I give you some pointers below as I describe the three types of goats — dairy, 
meat, and fiber — and the breeds within those types.
Looking Into Dairy Goats
If you want dairy goats, you have a variety of breeds and sizes to choose 
from. The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA), one of the United 
States’ two major dairy goat registries (organizations that keep official lists of 
goats within a specific breed, provide registration certificates, and compile 
pedigrees), recognizes eight different dairy goat breeds: Alpine, LaMancha, 
Nigerian Dwarf, Nubian, Oberhasli, Saanen, Sable, and Toggenburg. The other 
registry, the American Goat Society (AGS) registers only purebreds and also 
recognizes the Pygmy as a dairy breed. (You can read more about registries 
and whether to buy registered or unregistered goats in Chapter 5.)

36
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Neither of these registries recognizes the mini crossbreeds that have captured 
the hearts of urban goat owners, so two new registries have sprung up: The 
Miniature Goat Registry (TMGR) and the Miniature Dairy Goat Association 
(MDGA).
Dairy goats provide milk, of course, and if you’re interested in a home supply 
of goat meat, your dairy goats can serve that purpose, too. Unfortunately, if 
you want fiber and milk, dairy goats won’t work because their coats generally 
are too short, but fiber goats usually don’t produce a lot of milk.
In the upcoming sections, I give you an idea of what each of the standard 
dairy goats looks like and some of their traits. If you decide that you just 
have to have one of these breeds but can’t find it in your area, see Chapter 7, 
which tells you about sources for finding goats.
Standard dairy goat breeds
The standard breeds are a good choice if you want dairy goats that produce 
a lot of milk and you have the space: ADGA and AGS require that each of the 
breeds reaches a minimum, but not a maximum, height and weight. The 
minimum height for does ranges from 28 inches to 32 inches, depending on 
breed. The minimum buck heights are 30 to 34 inches.
The standard breeds produce an average of 5 to 8 pounds of milk each day 
for 10 months. This is the equivalent of approximately 21⁄2 quarts to a gallon 
per day. Dairy goats’ milk production starts out lower, gradually increases 
throughout lactation, and then goes down again. 
If you think you want standard dairy goats, deciding which one is for you 
depends mainly on size, the look and personality that strikes your fancy, and 
what is available to you. The upcoming sections tell you about the standard 
dairy goat breeds and some of the characteristics that define them.

Alpine
Alpines, also known as French Alpines, hail from the Alps. They are large 
goats that have erect ears and come in a variety of colors and patterns. 
They’re friendly and hardy, and the wethers (castrated males) are a favorite 
for use as pack animals. Many goat milk dairies have Alpines in their milking 
string because they consistently produce a lot of milk. Figure 3-1 shows an 
Alpine goat.
 
Figure 3-1:

LaMancha
LaManchas look earless, but they actually have very small ears. The ears are 
of two types: gopher ears and elf ears. (Figure 3-2 shows a LaMancha with 
gopher ears.) Gopher ears are very small and rounded; elf ears are less than 
two inches long and turn up or down. People tend to either love or hate the 
looks of the LaMancha.

38
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
LaManchas descended from the Spanish Murciana and Spanish LaMancha 
goats brought to the United States from Mexico for meat and milk. They first 
got recognition as a separate breed in the early 1950s and are fast becoming 
a very popular breed. They come in a variety of colors and patterns and are 
very friendly. I have also found them quite curious, with an ability to get to 
food regardless of where you put it!

Nubian
Nubians (see Figure 3-3) are one of the most popular breeds. They have long, 
floppy ears and a rounded (Roman) nose, and they have been bred to be 
very large. Their milk has a high butterfat content, and they produce a lot of 
it — which makes them a good choice if you want to make cheese. Because of 
their large size, they make good meat goats, too.
Unfortunately, Nubians also are known for the loud, annoying cries that many 
of them make. The cries make them undesirable in some neighborhoods and 
on some farms.

G-6-S gene mutation: A persistent 
defect in Nubians
The G-6-S gene mutation was first discovered 
in 1987. Further investigation showed that about 
25 percent of Nubians carry the gene, which 
results from a single mutation. It affects only 
Nubians and Nubian crosses.
Goats with the gene mutation lack the enzyme 
G-6-S, which causes a variety of symptoms 
that vary in severity. Failure to grow is the main 
sign. In some cases, a kid starts out smaller 
than normal and continues to grow slowly; in 
others a kid grows normally for three months or 
so and then stops growing. Other goats seem to 
grow to a normal size but are found to actually 
be small in comparison to other goats in that 
bloodline. Other signs include a lack of muscle 
mass, a “slab-sided” appearance or a “blocky” 
head. They seem to have compromised immune 
systems, experience reproductive problems 
and, in some cases, become deaf or blind. The 
longest a goat with G-6-S has been known to 
survive is less than four years. Death is usually 
caused by heart failure. Because goats with 
this defect can live long enough to breed, they 
continue to pass on the gene. Many Nubian 
breeders now test all breeding stock for the 
defect.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Oberhasli
Oberhaslis were originally known as Swiss Alpines, a variation on the Alpine. 
They were eventually recognized as a separate breed with distinct markings. 
They have erect ears, are medium-sized, and have a reddish-brown color 
(chamoisee) with black markings on their backs, belly, tail, and legs. Does 
can also be pure black.
Oberhaslis are my favorite of the large breeds because of their sweet 
temperament and beautiful markings. They have good dairy character, 
which means they seem to like being milked.
Saanen and Sable
Saanens are white or off-white in coloring and are the largest of the standard 
dairy goats. Sables are Saanens that aren’t white, due to a recessive gene. 
They have erect ears, like the Alpine, and are usually mellow and easy-going.
Sables and Saanans are known for their high milk production and are 
therefore often used in commercial dairies. A downside to Saanens is that 
their white coats show dirt and also make them more prone to sunburn.
Toggenburg
Toggenburgs, also referred to as Toggs, are beautifully marked and range 
in color from fawn to chocolate brown with white markings. They resemble 
a medium-sized Alpine in body shape, with erect ears. The Toggenburg is a 
Swiss dairy goat from Toggenburg Valley of Switzerland at Obertoggenburg. 
They are also credited as being the oldest known dairy goat breed.
Toggs produce a moderate amount of milk but are known for long lactations. 
More than one person has told me that they don’t like the taste of 
Toggenburgs’ milk, probably because it has a low butterfat content and 
doesn’t taste as rich as some of the other goats’ milk.
Miniature breeds
The standard dairy goat breeds are impressive, but maybe you don’t want 
to be drowning in milk. With the miniature breeds, you get some of the same 
characteristics but in a smaller package.
Miniature breeds are relatively new to the scene but are growing in popularity. 
Miniature dairy goats include Nigerian Dwarves, Pygmies, and the most 
recent development in dairy goats in the United States: miniature, crossbred 
versions of the standard breeds, called minis.

41
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
Nigerian Dwarf
Nigerian Dwarves are miniature goats that came to the United States from 
Africa. They are not true dwarves because they are proportionate in size. 
(A true dwarf has normal body proportions with abnormally short stature.) 
They are colorful, friendly, easy to handle, and in some cases quite good milk 
producers. Figure 3-4 shows a Nigerian Dwarf goat.
Two height standards exist for Nigerian Dwarves. The Nigerian Dwarf Goat 
Association allows 17 to 21 inches for does and 19 to 23 inches for bucks, 
while the American Goat Society allows a maximum of 22.5 inches for does 
and 23.5 inches for bucks. Their average weight is around 75 pounds.
Their kids are the cutest things around, and Nigerian Dwarves have a lot of 
them. Quadruplets aren’t rare, and you even see quintuplets and sextuplets 
from time to time. The does tend to be easy kidders (I’m not kidding!) and 
natural mothers.
Nigerians are popular as milkers, 4-H projects, and pets. The wethers are 
easier to sell because they make good backyard pets and are easy for children 
to handle. They can be expensive, but if you find a breeder who will sell them 
unregistered you can get them for a reasonable price.
 
Some Nigerian Dwarves give only about a pound (one pint) of milk per day, 
but others produce as much as 8 pounds (a half-gallon). A lot of them are hard 
to milk because of their small teats, but others have been bred to alleviate this 
problem. If you want these goats for milking, make sure to ask about milking, 
look at the udders, and try milking some goats, if you can.
Little goat, a lot of cheese
My first goats were Nigerians. Their milk 
was high in protein and extremely high in 
butterfat — normally 5 to 6 percent and as 
high as 10 percent at the end of their lacta-
tion (normally 10 months). This higher butterfat 
milk produces more cheese than milk with low 
butterfat. 
I did a comparison between the milk of a 
Toggenburg and a Nigerian and found that I got 
twice as much cheese from the Nigerian milk!
At least one goat cheese dairy in the United 
States uses Nigerians exclusively because 
of the quantity of cheese they can produce. 
You have to milk more goats to get the same 
quantity of milk you would from standard dairy 
goats, but you can get a lot more cheese from 
each gallon of milk.

42
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Some urban goat farmers shy away from the Nigerians, despite their 
petite size, because they can be loud. But their flashy colors and winning 
personalities are a draw.
You can eat a Nigerian, but most people don’t. The cost isn’t worth the end 
result, and besides, they’re so darn cute!
 
Figure 3-4: 
Nigerian 
Dwarf goat.
 
Pygmy
Pgymies, like Nigerians, are miniature goats that came to the United States 
from Africa. Although they probably descended from the same stock, 
Pygmies have been bred to be short and stocky (unlike Nigerians) and are 
more limited in color, ranging from white to brown to black with only minor 
variations. The most common pattern is agouti, which refers to alternating 
bands of colors, kind of like salt and pepper hair. (Figure 3-5 shows an agouti 
Pygmy goat.)

43
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
 
Figure 3-5: 
An agouti 
Pygmy goat.
 
Pygmy goats aren’t usually considered dairy goats, but because they don’t 
fit neatly into any category I include them here. Most of them are raised as 
pets or 4-H projects, but a small minority of breeders raise them for milk. The 
Pygmies raised for milk tend to look more like Nigerians in body shape. If you 
want Pygmies for milk, make sure to ask whether they’re registered with the 
American Goat Society and whether the breeder is milking them.
Because they have been bred down to a short, compact size, Pygmies often 
have problems kidding and need the services of a veterinarian for cesareans. 
They are not quite as prolific as the Nigerians, either.
Like Nigerians, Pygmies are much less expensive to keep and take up a lot 
less space than a standard dairy goat, so they work well in rural and urban 
settings.

44
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Kinder
The Kinder is a moderate-sized breed that was developed in Washington and 
first registered in 1988. It is a cross between the Pygmy and Nubian breeds. 
Kinders are good dual-purpose (milk and meat) goats that are ideal for family 
farms.
Minis
If you really like one of the standard breeds but are in the city or just don’t 
have the space for big goats, minis are ideal. These goats are a cross between 
a Nigerian Dwarf buck and a doe of the breed you want to miniaturize.
 
Don’t breed a full-sized buck to a Nigerian Dwarf doe. The doe may have 
problems kidding as a result of too-large kids.
The minis don’t have quite as many multiple kids as the Nigerians — which 
can even have sextuplets, but they are more likely to have triplets and 
quadruplets than the standard breeds.
You can find Mini Nubians and MiniManchas pretty easily. Finding Oberians, 
Mini Toggs, Mini Alpines, and Mini Saanens can be more challenging because 
there are fewer of them. (Chapter 16 tells you more about breeding miniature 
dairy goats.)
If you plan to milk and you live in a city that allows backyard goats, these 
little goats are a good choice. Jenny Grant of the Goat Justice League, which 
got the Seattle City Council to allow miniature goats within the city limits, 
recommends the Oberian and the MiniMancha for urban situations because 
they’re the quietest.
Understanding mini generations
The kids produced by the first cross of a 
Nigerian buck with a standard dairy goat is the 
first generation (F1). Breeding an F1 to another 
F1 gives you second generation (F2) kids. 
Breeding F2 to F2 gives you F3 kids and so on, 
for six generations.
A kid’s generation is always one generation 
higher than the lowest generation parent. So if 
you breed an F2 to an F1, the kids will be F2. 
Even if you breed an F4 to a F1, the kids will still 
be F2.
F1 and F2 goats are considered experimental. 
F3 through F5 goats are called “American” 
and an F6 is a purebred. Ask about the 
generation when buying a registered mini 
dairy goat. Purebreds are worth more than first 
generations.

 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
Discovering Meat Goats
A lot of people around the world eat goat meat (about 75 percent, at last 
count), and it is catching on in the United States, as well. The meat is very 
lean and delicious. Meat goats are generally not used for milking, and some 
even have traits that make them undesirable to milk. Most of the breeds 
don’t make good fiber goats because they have short coats, but the Spanish 
goat is an exception. 
Meat goats grow fast and are fantastic brush-eaters. Some breeds are nearly 
self-sufficient because they evolved in feral conditions. They require much 
less time for management because they have developed resistance to the 
parasites, foot rot, and respiratory problems that are so common in other 
goats.
If you’re interested in goats to sell in the fast-growing U.S. market, to get rid 
of kudzu or blackberries, or just for your own freezer, you have a growing 
number of breeds to choose from.
Boer
Boer goats are large, heavy animals that resemble Nubians because of their 
Roman noses and floppy ears. They’re white and reddish-brown (although 
some are all red), and many are horned. Their horns are short and curve 
back close to the head. Bucks can weigh from 260 to 380 pounds and does 
from 210 to 265 pounds. Figure 3-6 shows a Boer buck.
Boers are originally from South Africa, where they were bred for hardiness. 
They came into the United States from New Zealand through Canada and 
continue to grow in popularity. Based on the increased number of men I saw 
at our local goat conference, the Boers are catching on. (Past conferences 
have drawn mainly dairy goat owners, who traditionally are women.)
If you want a purebred, high-quality Boer, expect to pay a lot. Boers are one 
of the most expensive breeds in the United States. That doesn’t mean that all 
of them are expensive, though; you can still get some good foundation stock 
(the stock you start your breeding program with) if you look around.
At least two organizations register Boer goats, including the American Boer 
Goat Association (ABGA) and the International Boer Goat Association (IBGA).

46
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Boers are quite adaptable and hardy, and most are affectionate and mild-
mannered. Their adaptability leads them to browse more than dairy goats 
because they can easily handle both heat and cold. Boers do have some fairly 
common genetic defects you need to watch for, including extra teats and 
abnormal testicles.
 
Figure 3-6: 
A South 
African 
Boer buck.
 
Tennessee fainting goat
Tennessee fainting goats are also known as myotonic or stiff-legged goats, 
because of their tendency to go rigid and fall down when they’re startled. 
This is a genetic defect in a recessive gene that probably started in just 
one goat and then was continued through breeding. The repeated muscle 
tightening means that the goats have more muscle and are therefore good 
meat goats.
Fainting goats are much smaller than Boers, weighing in at between 50 and 75 
pounds and becoming no more than 25 inches tall. They’re about the same 
size as the mini dairy goats.

47
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
They come in an array of colors and patterns and have long ears that stick 
out sideways. They have long horns that curve backward. They can be shy 
animals (wouldn’t you be if you kept falling down at the most inopportune 
times?) but have sweet personalities.
 
The fainting goats, because of their diminutive size, may be a better choice for 
a meat goat breeder who has limited space to work with. The bucks can also 
be crossed with Boer does to grade up to higher meat production.
Some people buy fainting goats for the novelty of scaring them and watching 
them drop. The goats have allegedly served another purpose — protecting 
sheep when a predator comes around. The goat drops and the predator eats 
it instead of the sheep. That’s literally a sacrificial goat!
Kiko
The Kiko goat is a newer breed that was created in New Zealand purely as 
a meat goat. Kikos are most often white with long, scimitar-like horns and 
medium ears that stick out sideways. They can gain substantial weight 
without supplemental feeding, which is a big plus for producers. If you have 
substantial range for these goats, they may be even more economical than 
Boers.
 
The name Kiko means “meat for consumption” in the Maori language. This 
unique breed came out of a government-funded project intended to thin out 
the native goat population. Once captured, some of the native goats were 
crossbred with milk and fiber goats with the intent of developing hardy goats 
that grew fast and produced a lot of meat.
Kikos came into the United States in the 1990s and were found to be superior 
to the Boer goat in terms of hardiness and adaptability. Their hooves have to 
be trimmed less frequently than other goats, they kid easily, and the does are 
good mothers. These traits make them perfect for a life on the range.
Kiko goats and offspring from crosses with other meat goats can be registered 
with the International Kiko Goat Association. They officially recognize a 
Boer/Kiko cross called the American Meatmaker. The American Kiko Goat 
Association (AKGA) allows some crossbreed registration, but the sire must 
always be a purebred Kiko.

48
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Spanish goat
 
Spanish goats, also called brush goats, scrub goats, and woods goats, are usually 
medium-sized and lanky with long horns that often twist at the end. They 
come in all colors and mostly have short hair but can also have long hair. 
They are known to be crossed with Nubian, Angora, Boer, and Alpine or other 
Swiss breeds, which you can often recognize by their looks. Those that are 
crossed with Cashmere goats can also serve as fiber goats. Figure 3-7 shows a 
Cashmere Spanish goat.
If you decide to get a Spanish goat, you will also be getting a little bit of U.S. 
history. These goats were originally brought over from Spain in the 16th 
century and evolved into nearly indigenous goats in the southern United 
States. Because they were feral, they are much hardier than goats such as the 
Boer so they make good, easy-care meat goats, much like the Kiko.
The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy has developed standards for 
the Spanish goat and formed the Spanish Goat Association (SGA). Its goal is 
to find Spanish goats and breeders in the United States to preserve the gene 
pool. The number of breeders is limited, and so far none operate in the West 
or Northeast.
 
If you want to learn more about true Spanish goats or even get a few, check 
out the SGA at www.spanishgoats.org.

 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
Newer crossbreeds
Because meat goats are growing in popularity, breeders are crossbreeding 
the existing breeds to develop newer, better goats. Some of the better-known 
breeds are the following:
 
✓ Texmaster is a moderate-sized meat goat and a trademarked cross 
between Boers and Tennessee Fainters developed by Onion Creek 
Ranch in Texas.
 
✓ Moneymaker goats were developed by Bob and Dusty Copeland of 
California by first crossbreeding Saanens and Nubians and then adding 
Boers into the mix.
 
✓ Savanna is another relatively new South African meat breed brought to 
the United States for its heat and drought resistance and excellent 
mothering abilities. Savannas are a muscular breed with long ears, thick 
black skin, and short white coat that develops a nice fluffy cashmere 
undercoat for additional warmth during the winter. They are highly 
adaptable to a variety of unpleasant weather conditions and are 
therefore suited to a good number of U.S. locations.
Investigating Fiber Goats
If you are a home spinner or want to get your own supply of fiber, consider 
the fiber goats. Angoras produce the fiber called mohair, which is a silky fiber 
used in many products. Cashmere, produced by the cashmere goat, is an 
even more exotic fiber and is in high demand. It comes from the undercoat of 
these goats.
Fiber goats, if you properly care for them, take a bit more work than some 
of the other goats. You can choose from medium to small goats in a variety 
of colors. If you want meat, some of these are dual-purpose goats. In the 
upcoming sections, I tell you about the choices you have in fiber goats and 
some of the pros and cons of each.
Angora
Angoras have long, wavy coats, with fiber called mohair. (Angora fiber comes 
from rabbits.) They are usually white, but some breeders are experimenting 
with producing other colors and even have their own registry, the Colored 
Angora Breeders Association (CABGA). They have short, curved horns, which 
are usually left on the goat, because they may regulate body temperature. The 
average adult goat produces 8 to 16 pounds of mohair each year, while kids 
give from 3 to 5 pounds of longer, finer hair. Figure 3-8 shows an Angora buck.

50
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Angora goats came from Turkey, and their name is derived from the city of 
Ankara, which used to be called Angora. These goats were first brought to 
the United States in 1849. Since then their popularity has grown, so that now 
the United States is one of the biggest producers of mohair. Most of the 
producers are in Texas.
 
If you’re wondering whether anyone has tried crossing Angoras with cashmeres, 
the answer is yes. But the resulting goats — called Cashgoras — were a bit 
of a flop, producing fiber that isn’t as useful or as high-quality as the original 
products.
Angoras may be raised on a range, but in that case a couple of problems 
arise. They are sensitive to temperature and cold, and wet weather can kill 
them. They also are not natural mothers and so they sometimes abandon 
their kids. The kids often need help to get started nursing. And with twins 
and triplets, the bigger kids hog all the milk if not controlled, leaving the little 
ones nothing to eat.
 
Figure 3-8: 
An Angora

51
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Capra Aegagrus Hircus (Goat, That Is)
Cashmere
Cashmere goats in the United States aren’t a breed but a type of goat. What 
makes a goat a cashmere goat is that it produces cashmere. According to 
the Eastern Cashmere Association, feral goats from Australia and Spanish 
goats in the United States are both cashmere producers. They just need to 
have been bred to produce the right quality of cashmere, a measurement 
that is determined by the cashmere industry. (The fiber has to be less than 
19 microns thick.) Most of the larger cashmere breeders originally imported 
high-quality fiber goats from Australia to start their herds.
Cashmere goats are dual fiber/meat goats. Like their non-cashmere feral 
relatives, they are quite hardy. But like dairy goats (and the Wicked Witch of 
the East) they don’t like rain and will run for shelter when it comes. Refer to 
Figure 3-7, which shows a Spanish cashmere goat.
U.S. cashmere goats are a little smaller than standard dairy goats but larger 
than Nigerians, making them a medium-sized goat. The bucks weigh about 
150 pounds and does about 100 pounds at maturity. Like the Angora, they 
aren’t disbudded, because their horns help them regulate temperature so 
their heavy coats don’t overheat them.
The cashmere is actually their downy undercoat. Their outer coat, called 
guard hair, is quite coarse and isn’t used for fiber.
 
Cashmere production in the United States is still a small market, so if you get 
cashmere goats, you will be part of an elite group. Breeders with large herds 
remove the cashmere once a year, between December and March. That’s 
because it grows in response to light — from the summer solstice until the 
winter solstice. If you don’t have a lot of goats, you can just comb out the 
cashmere when it starts to shed. The average cashmere goat produces only 
about 4 ounces of cashmere per year.
Miniature fiber goats
I haven’t yet seen or heard of a miniature meat goat (probably because they 
don’t make enough burger), but people seem to have a general predilection 
for miniaturizing animals. That tendency applies to fiber goats, as well as the 
dairy goats. 
You find two different breeds of mini fiber goats in the United States — the 
Pygora and the Nigora. As you can tell by their names, both are crosses with 
the Angora.

52
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Pygora
The Pygora is a cross between the Pygmy and the Angora that was started 
by Katherine Jorgensen in Oregon. She wanted to use the fiber for hand-
spinning. The Pygora is a small, easy-to-handle, and good-tempered fiber 
goat. These little guys are registered by the Pygora Breeders Association 
(PBA), which started in 1987. A Pygora can be up to 75 percent of either 
breed.
Pygoras come in the same colors as Pygmies. Does weigh between 65 and 
75 pounds, while bucks and wethers are between 75 and 95 pounds. The 
PBA requires them to be a minimum of 18 inches tall (does) and 23 inches 
(bucks).
Pygoras can produce up to four pounds of fleece a year, a bit less than the 
full-sized Angora. They are smart and can sometimes be found in petting zoos 
and circuses.
Some people raise Pygoras for pets or brush-eaters and never use the fiber. 
Because of their longer hair, these goats are more prone to lice and should be 
sheared twice a year. (See chapter 16 for more about harvesting goat fiber.)
Nigora
Nigoras are a cross between a Nigerian Dwarf and a Pygmy. They have the 
advantage of producing colorful fiber as well as milk. This is still a fledgling 
breed, with a breed club started only in 2007. No breed standards exist on 
this breed as of 2009.
You might have trouble finding Nigora goats, but you can still buy a Nigerian 
buck and some Angoras and start your own herd!
Considering crossbreeds
Any of the goat breeds can be crossbred to 
each other, either intentionally or by accident. 
(Many a crossbreed has mysteriously appeared 
five months after a buck escape!) These inad-
vertent crossbreeds usually can’t be registered 
without genetic testing, and so they go for a 
bargain. ADGA accepts and records crosses 
between their standard size breeds into their 
association as “experimental” and provide 
classes for them at their shows. Their offspring 
can be graded up to “American.”
Crossbreeds also may be cheaper than purebreds 
if they are from farms that don’t really care 
about the goat breed, but just want a milker or 
some meat. 
Don’t discount the crossbreeds or experimentals. 
They may be just what you want if you don’t 
care about a specific breed, or if you really 
care about the breed and want one of the new, 
experimental breeds such as a mini dairy goat 
or a Nigora.

Ready for a Goat
In This Chapter
▶ Determining the right number of goats to get
▶ Identifying which plants are poison
▶ Becoming aware of potential predators
▶ Protecting your goats with a guardian animal
B
ringing goats into your life requires a fair amount of preparation. You 
need to make sure that you have enough space and that the space you 
have is safe before you introduce goats.
In this chapter, I tell you how to decide how many goats to get, and what to 
do to keep your goats safe after you bring them home. I talk about fencing, 
potential predators, and the pros and cons of various guardian animals that 
you can use to help protect your goats against predators.
Figuring Out How Many 
Goats You Can Support
One of the biggest mistakes that people make is getting too many goats. You 
need at least two goats so that they can keep each other company, but it’s 
better to start slow. And you need to get only wethers or does, depending 
on your purpose, unless you have seriously considered the implications of 
getting a buck and decided that you really need one. (See Chapter 7 to find 
out more about getting your goats.)

54
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
The number of goats you can adequately provide space for on your property 
depends on the answers to a few questions:
 
✓ How much fenced pasture or range is available to the goats?
 
 If you live in an area where you can’t let your goats range (roam over 
a large area), such as a desert area or in the city, you need about 20 
square feet per adult standard-sized goat for sleeping and resting, plus 
another 30 square feet (outdoors, ideally) for exercise. This gives them 
enough space to move around and not be cramped or too confined.
 
 If you have a larger outdoor area in which to raise your goats — where 
they’ll have pasture, woods, or range — you need less indoor space per 
goat because they only rest and sleep there. The rule of thumb is 10 to15 
square feet per adult standard-sized goat.
 
✓ How much space do you have for a sleeping area?
 
 Goats like to sleep together in small groups, and so the actual sleeping 
area they need can be quite a bit smaller than their living area. If you 
have a building with a lot of separate pens, keep the doors open so they 
are accessible to all of your goats. (Of course, the herd queen and her 
brood will take over the best spot anyway.)
 
✓ Will they have kids?
 
 A standard-sized goat needs at least a 4-foot-by-5-foot kidding pen. If 
you have more than one doe that you want to have kid, breed them at 
different times, and clean and sanitize the pen between kiddings.
Making Sure Fencing Is Adequate
Goats need good fencing to keep them in and to keep predators out. You can 
also use fencing to protect your trees and shrubs from goats. (See the section 
“Making trees goat-proof.”) Goats are intelligent and curious, and if they spot 
a weakness in your fencing, they take advantage of it and escape.
Adequate fencing means different things in different situations. If you have 
kids and adult goats, you need to make sure the kids can’t get through the 
fencing and the adults can’t get over it. Permanent fencing around the 
perimeter of the goat area has to be strong enough to last for many years, 
while temporary fencing that allows goats to browse in different areas only 
has to keep them in for a limited time.
 
Goats love to rub on walls, fences, and even people. If you put in new fencing, 
make sure that you set your fence posts deep enough so that they can 
withstand the weight of a goat dragging his body across the fence regularly. If 
you use wooden posts, they need to be at least two feet deep. If you are using 
metal T-posts, make sure to pound them in past the V at the bottom that holds 
them in the ground.

 Chapter 4: Getting Your Property Ready for a Goat
If you have an area with existing fencing, walk the fence line and 
 
✓ Inspect the fence for holes in or under it. Patch holes in the fence and 
fill or block holes under it.
 
✓ Check each fence post to make sure it’s solidly set. Replace, add a new 
post, or solidify the weak one.
 
✓ Measure to see whether the fence is high enough. The necessary 
height depends to some degree on the type of goat and the type of 
predators in your area. A 4-foot fence is adequate in most cases. If it 
isn’t, add a strand or two of electric wire or fence it higher.
 
 If the area you’re fencing borders a busy road, don’t skimp on fencing. 
Make sure your goats can’t get over it and cause an accident or get 
injured.
 
✓ Determine whether any trees need to be fenced out or around. Keep 
goats away from trees you don’t want eaten or that are poisonous. See 
the section “Protecting your plants” for more information.
Running through types of fencing
If you need to put in new fencing or replace fencing, you have a variety of 
fencing types to choose from. The most common types of fencing that people 
use for goats include:
 
✓ Field fencing: Field fencing, also called woven wire, attached to metal 
T-posts is probably the most common type of fencing for goats. It is 
moderately expensive and is sturdy if installed properly. A four-foot-high 
field fence will keep miniature goats in but isn’t high enough for a 
determined goat that is bigger. A strand of electric wire along the top 
and 10 inches off the ground usually keeps all goats in. I recommend 
field fencing. One downside is that it is hard to use in hilly areas.
 
✓ Cattle or hog panels: Galvanized cattle panel with graduated spacing 
(smaller to larger from the bottom) makes excellent fences for goats. 
The panels are 50 inches high — tall enough to keep most goats in (I say 
“almost,” because I had a Nigerian Dwarf buck with only three good legs 
climb one to get to does in heat). You can add a strand or two of electric 
wire along the top for larger goats. To keep in miniature goat kids 
you may need to reinforce with chicken wire or woven wire along the 
bottom.
 
 This fencing is easy to install; you can attach each panel to T-posts set 
four feet apart. The disadvantages are that the panels are very expensive, 
hard to work with on hills, and hard to transport because they come in 
16-foot lengths and are heavy. If you can overcome these obstacles, I 
highly recommend using cattle panels for fencing.

56
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
 
✓ Electric wire: Electric wire is an excellent addition to any of the other 
types of fencing. The wire and insulators are inexpensive; the biggest 
cost is the charger and ground rod. A strand along the top helps keep 
predators out and goats and livestock guardian dogs in. A friend of mine 
uses three strands of electric wire about a foot off the ground with 
temporary posts in areas where goat escape isn’t a disaster. The 
advantage is that it can be moved if you want goats to browse different 
areas. The disadvantage is that some goats can walk right through it 
with seemingly no effect. (Or they get out and then are too scared to 
get back in.) You must train your goats to the fence prior to using it 
this way. You can do this by setting it up inside a fenced area and then 
watching them while they test it out. Normally they learn after only two 
shocks.
 
 Use a 4,000-volt charger for goat fencing. If your fencing isn’t near a 
power source, get a solar charger. Place the grounding rod in a location 
that is as dry as possible. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations 
for grounding and charger placement.
 
 If you want the best electric fence, ideal for keeping coyotes out, you can 
invest in high-tensile electric fencing, also known as New Zealand fencing. 
It combines woven wire and electric in one fence, with alternating wires 
electric. It is more expensive than standard electric wire.
 
Avoid using barbed wire or wood fences for goats. Barbed wire fencing is 
less expensive than woven wire or cattle panels, but goats can get injured 
by the barbs. Wood fences, such as the white ones used for horses, are very 
expensive, don’t last as long, and are inadequate for goat kids, who can get out 
between the boards.
Planning for gates
Plan space for enough gates in the places you need them — highly trafficked 
areas, near structures, and between different pastures. Make sure they are 
strong enough to withstand goats. This means a good, goat-proof latch. If you 
use a hook and eye latch, make sure that it has the extra piece that locks so 
it can’t just be pushed out of the eye. I recommend that you install gates so 
they open into the enclosure, otherwise a goat can more easily get loose.
Make the gates as high as the fence, if possible, with no gaps underneath the 
gate. If you will need to drive or get a riding lawn mower or tractor into the 
area, make sure the gate is wide enough.

57
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Property Ready for a Goat
You can purchase pre-made gates of differing widths. If you use cattle panel 
for fencing, you can make gates from smaller pieces. If you make cattle panel 
gates, overlap them with the fence to give added strength, especially in an 
area that houses bucks.
Protecting Your Plants
Goats don’t appreciate the aesthetics of a well-tended flower garden or a 
fruit orchard. (They do appreciate the taste of it, though.) They are browsers, 
which means that they prefer bushes, trees, and woody plants. They also 
prefer variety in their diet and so try most of the plants that are available.
If you have a favorite lilac or rose bush, apple tree, or even a large fir tree, 
be ready to have it relieved of leaves, bark, and ultimately its life. If you want 
to keep any flowers or bushes and trees, make sure they aren’t growing in 
an area where your goats might go. You can fence them off, or in the case of 
trees, you can goat-proof them. The upcoming sections give you ideas for 
protecting your plants and trees.
Considering which trees to protect
You need to remove any trees that are poisonous to goats and fence off or 
goat-proof any others you don’t want destroyed. (See the section “Removing 
poisonous plants” to find out which common trees can be poisonous.)
If your property is large enough, you can fence off an area for your goats that 
doesn’t have trees, or you can decide to sacrifice some trees to the goats. 
After all, the bark and leaves are good for them. You can even locate the pen 
where the leaves can still fall or branches hang over the fence so your goats 
can enjoy the trees without destroying them. If the area you need to fence 
includes trees that you want to protect, try goat-proofing the trees. The next 
section tells you how.
Making trees goat-proof
Goats will damage and eventually kill trees by browsing on the leaves and 
shoots, stripping the bark, and rubbing their horns (if they have them) on 
the trees. The only trees I have that seem to be immune to goat damage are 
old-growth Douglas firs whose bark is probably not tender enough for them. 

58
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Your goats cause worse damage when they don’t have access to any other 
plants to eat, but they enjoy tender bark and leaves even when grass and 
shrubs are available. 
If you want to save trees that are within the goats’ fenced area or just outside 
the fence, you need to goat-proof them. A better choice, if you can manage it, 
is to avoid including trees in the goats’ area; goat-proofing individual trees is 
time-consuming and expensive.
 
For smaller trees or saplings, you can buy five-foot-tall tree bark protectors 
from garden stores or wholesalers. These mesh or corrugated plastic tubes 
were designed to fit around the tree trunks to protect them from deer.
You can goat-proof a larger tree simply by wrapping it up to the level that 
your largest goat can reach when standing with its front legs on the tree. You 
can determine this height by holding a treat up next to the tree and measuring 
how high the goat can reach. (If your goats aren’t full-grown, you have to 
estimate.)
 
One downside to goat-proofing is that it can inhibit growth of the tree, so you 
need to check the tree to see whether the wrapping is too tight and re-wrap it 
every few years.
Materials you can use to wrap a tree include
 
✓ Plastic strips designed to cover rain gutters to keep leaves out. I found 
these at a garage sale. I wrapped them around the tree and hooked them 
together with wire.
 
✓ Hardware cloth, also called rabbit wire. It is more rigid than gutter 
covers and can be attached to the tree or to posts in the ground 
surrounding the tree. However, it’s expensive and doesn’t fit as neatly 
as gutter covers. If you attach hardware cloth directly to the tree, it also 
will inhibit outward growth.
 
✓ Window screen netting. You can obtain a 1,000-foot roll for less than 
$100 and use it to wrap quite a few trees, depending on their diameter.
If you have only a few trees at risk of being debarked and want something 
more permanent, you can goat-proof trees with triangular wooden enclosures 
like those in Figure 4-1. A wooden enclosure requires three posts as tall as 
the tallest goat can reach, and wooden slats attached with screws across 
them. You can attach them close enough together to prevent the goats from 
getting their heads through the slats, or you can make the enclosure far 
enough outside the tree that they can’t reach even if they get their heads 
through.

Protecting Your Herd
After you finally get the goats you dreamed of, you don’t want to put them 
at risk or lose them from an avoidable cause. In this section I tell you about 
some of the steps you can take to protect your herd from potential hazards.
Putting hazards out of reach
When you’re checking out your property, yard, garage, or barn in preparation 
for your goats, reconsider items that you have stored or are in use there with 
an eye to goat safety. If you’re going to drink your goats’ milk or eat them, 
you are also at risk of ingesting any poison that you’re goats get into. Remove 
any items that might put a goat at risk, especially
 
✓ Lead paint: Goats love to chew and will invariably chew on walls, 
especially if you don’t want them to. Lead paint is common in old barns 
and other structures. To be safe, assume that the paint on old walls and 
doors is lead-based, and don’t use those areas for goats. Bare, untreated 
wood is actually best.

60
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
 
✓ Railroad ties: If you are putting up a new structure and have access to 
free railroad ties, don’t use them. They contain creosote, which is 
poisonous to goats.
 
✓ Plastic: Keep all plastic, particularly plastic bags and plastic twine, out 
of reach of goats. Goats that swallow plastic can suffer from a blocked 
rumen and lose weight or die. (See “Hardware disease” in Chapter 11.) 
Swallowing plastic also causes symptoms such as loss of appetite, 
decreased milk production, and bloating. Be careful to properly dispose 
of plastic from mineral blocks or other types of feed.
 
✓ Solvents and other chemicals: Make sure that you have removed any 
old kerosene, solvents, or other chemicals that people often keep in 
garages or barns. These hazards can sicken or kill goats. Even those 
stored on high shelves within a goat area aren’t safe.
 
Store all feed away from your goats in an area they can’t access. If they 
inadvertently get to grain, they will eat until it’s gone — and then you will 
have very sick or dead goats. It happened to me once, and I didn’t know which 
goats had overeaten (except the LaMancha instigator) and so I had to treat 
many goats. The feeling of panic is terrible, and so is the guilt when a goat 
dies because of your mistake. See Chapter 11 to find out about enterotoxemia 
(overeating disease).
Avoiding tethering
 
A tethered goat is like a piece of cheese in a mousetrap. The goat is bait for 
coyotes, cougars, dogs, or any predator that lives in the area. When you tether 
your goats, you put them at risk. Because goats are browsers, they won’t 
stand still while on a rope. They move constantly, which means that they may 
circle around a tree or get hung up in a branch. If they are left on a hot day, 
they may get dehydrated because they are unable to get to water after 
wrapping themselves around an object. Goats may hang or choke themselves 
with a chain or rope. The snap holding them may come off or break and 
release them into a high traffic or otherwise dangerous area.
My neighbor had a goat that he tethered in the orchard to eat down the 
grass. One day he had a feeling that something was wrong and came down 
the hill to find the goat hung from a tree branch. I don’t know how he 
managed to do that (but then, he was a goat), but fortunately the neighbor 
got there before the goat had choked to death.
Don’t tether your goats. Instead, build them a proper fence, or if you need 
to move them around, use cattle panel sections or electric wire to create a 
barrier that you can move from place to place during the day. And supervise 
them or get them a guardian for protection. 

61
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Property Ready for a Goat
Providing a safe place to bunk down
The best way to ensure that your goats are safe, especially if you don’t have 
a guardian animal, is to make sure that they are secured in a building with 
no open windows from dusk until dawn. Unless you have a very heavy door, 
make sure the door closes and latches to prevent animals from getting in and 
goats from getting out.
Considering local predators
Find out about the common predators in your area when deciding how to 
keep your goats safe. Don’t think that because you are raising goats in the 
city that you don’t have to worry about predators. While some of the animals 
that we traditionally think of as predators are rarely found in the city, dogs 
are rampant and birds abound. Kids are particularly at risk, because they are 
small and lack life experience.
Here are some of the more common goat predators. If you have a goat attack, 
you can determine which of these predators is responsible by examining the 
scat (manure) left behind and by the focus of the attack.
Domestic or feral dogs
Dogs are the worst predators of goats, attacking and killing more often than 
any wild animal and doing it for fun rather than because they’re hungry. Dogs 
go after goats individually or in packs, with pack attacks being the worst for 
obvious reasons.
Dogs dig under fences to get to goats or other small livestock. You can identify 
a dog attack because dogs usually go for a goat’s hind legs and rear end. They 
can kill or cause injuries severe enough to create major physical problems for 
a goat. Goats that are attacked by dogs often have to be euthanized or die later 
from the trauma of being terrorized and seeing their herdmates killed.
Coyotes
Eastern coyotes hunt individually, looking for weak members of a herd; 
western coyotes hunt in packs. You can tell the difference between a coyote 
attack and a dog attack because dogs chase and try to get as many goats as 
they can, while coyotes, which are looking for food, will go for the throat and 
then try to get at a goat’s internal organs. They may even try to carry the 
animal away for safe eating.
If you hear coyotes howling in your area, your goats are at risk if they don’t 
have additional protection such as a guardian animal or high tensile electric 
fencing. Neither of these is failproof, though; I have heard of packs of coyotes 
luring a dog away while other cohorts go after the goats.

62
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
Cougars
Cougars hunt individually. They leave tooth punctures and claw marks on 
the upper torso when they attack a goat. They also have been known to 
drag their prey a distance away, bury it, and come back later to eat. A good 
livestock guardian dog will normally deter a cougar, unless it is very hungry. 
Nevertheless, I know of a rancher whose three Great Pyrenees guardian dogs 
were killed by a cougar one by one over several nights.
 
If you live in an area with cougars, get more than one livestock guardian dog 
to protect your goats.
Birds
Ravens and black vultures attack goats from time to time — generally when 
they are down from sickness or trying to have their kids outside. Ravens 
peck an animal’s head and gouge out its eyes. Ravens attack in groups, which 
causes a problem for does trying to protect more than one kid.
The USDA recommends hanging a vulture carcass or an effigy (fake vulture 
carcass) to deter vultures. Owls, eagles, and large hawks also may bother 
small kids, especially if they get separated from their mothers and cry. You 
can prevent losses to all types of birds by making sure your goats have safe, 
indoor kidding pens.
Other predators
Wolves, bears, foxes, wild pigs, and even feral cats will go after goats if their 
regular food supply is disrupted. You only have to read the newspaper to 
realize that humans are also predators on goats — some rustling for food, 
but others killing for the fun of it, as a prank, to get even with the owner, or 
for some other misguided reason.
Using guardian animals for security
Many goat owners keep livestock guardian dogs, donkeys, llamas, or alpacas 
with goats as full-time guard animals. Guardian animals can add a substantial 
cost in terms of training and upkeep, but they may be well worth the effort 
and time if they work out.
 
Try to get a guardian animal from a breeder who has used the animals for this 
purpose and can vouch for (but not guarantee) their pedigree, training, and 
temperament.

63
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Property Ready for a Goat
Livestock guardian dogs
Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) were bred and have been used for thousands 
of years to protect goats or sheep in Europe and Asia. They live and bond 
with the goats, are aggressive toward predators, and are focused on the job. 
These dogs are traditionally white, which enables them to blend in with the 
sheep flock and be distinguished from predators. Of the many breeds of 
livestock guardian dogs, the Great Pyrenees is probably the best known. 
Other common livestock guardian breeds include
 
✓ Akbash
 
✓ Anatolian
 
✓ Komodor
 
✓ Kuvasz
 
✓ Maremma
 
✓ Ovcharka
 
✓ Shar Planinetz
 
✓ Slovak Cuvac
 
✓ Tatra Sheepdog
LGDs live with the livestock they protect yet have a relationship with their 
human caretakers. They are large, aloof, and can be intimidating to strangers. 
If you plan to get one, expect to do a lot of training and supervision because 
they don’t reach maturity for about three years. You have to be the alpha 
member of the group so the dog knows you are in charge. Neutering or spaying 
a guardian dog also helps ensure that it will be a successful goat-guard.
 
An LGD probably won’t work out well for you if you’re raising goats in an 
urban area. They warn predators to stay out of the area by barking, mostly at 
night. Make sure you’re aware of any noise ordinances and know your neighbors 
and whether they will take issue with a barking dog before getting an LGD.
These dogs also have a tendency to roam, which might cause problems if you 
have neighbors who don’t want your dogs on their property. Because I have 
only a small property, I have had a problem with one of my LGDs roaming. 
Luckily, my neighbors appreciate having a guardian dog and welcome her 
patrolling their property and the woods behind our land.
If you have a large herd or a large area where your goats browse, one guardian 
may not be enough to protect them. Guardian dogs often act in teams to 
protect against packs of predators. Make sure before you get your dog that 
it’s from a stock bred to be guardians for sheep or goats.

64
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
LGDs live to be only 7 to 9 years old because of their large size. Plan to add 
new dogs periodically as your protectors age.
 
Don’t buy a herding breed such as Australian shepherd or border collie to 
guard your goats; they aren’t qualified. Their job is to herd, and you may have 
a problem with them chasing goats. That isn’t to say that some haven’t been 
successful, just that they are unlikely to do a good job guarding and protecting 
goats.
Donkeys
Donkeys have been used for hundreds of years to guard sheep and other 
herd animals. They’re very intelligent and have good hearing and eyesight. 
They work better alone and don’t like dogs, so they can’t work as a team with 
an LGD. Donkeys’ dislike of dogs also makes them effective against coyotes 
(which aren’t dogs, but look like them).
Because donkeys are naturally herd animals, if they’re bonded to the goats 
they can be counted on to stay with them most of the time. Ideally, you get a 
guardian donkey at birth or as soon as it’s weaned to make sure it bonds with 
the goats. Because they eat the same food as the goats, donkeys also will 
want to stay with the herd after they realize that’s where the food is.
When a guardian donkey becomes aware of a predator, she situates herself 
between the intruder and the herd and brays loudly. If the animal doesn’t 
leave, she chases it, and if that doesn’t work, she attacks by rearing up on her 
hind legs and coming down on the predator with her front feet.
 
Intact jacks (male donkeys) are too aggressive to be effective guardian animals, 
and so you need to get a gelded (neutered) jack or a jenny (female) if you want 
to use a donkey as a guardian. You’ll also be better off finding one that has 
been bred as a guardian. Donkeys not raised with goats or other livestock may 
be aggressive toward your goats, especially at feeding time. If you get one that 
wasn’t previously bonded to goats, be sure to introduce her slowly and 
supervise them closely for several weeks. When you purchase a guardian 
donkey ask for an agreement to exchange the animal if it doesn’t work out.
Llamas and alpacas
Llamas and alpacas are good guardian animals because they bond quickly 
to goats and also eat the same feed. Castrated males make the best goat 
guardians. Males can injure goats by trying to mount them and can be too 
aggressive toward humans as well. I had a female llama that I tried to use as 
a guardian, but she never really understood the job. She loved to chase goats 
for sport. She had been handled by humans for too long and didn’t get an 
early start on the job.
I also disliked the llama trait that people are so pleased with: always using 
the same spot to relieve themselves. Unfortunately, the spot my llama chose 

65
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Property Ready for a Goat
was right in the middle of the barn. Rather than go out in the pasture, if she 
felt the urge she came into the barn and let loose.
Unlike dogs, llamas work better as guardians when they’re alone instead 
of in a pack. A llama and guard dog combination can be trained to work 
cooperatively, though.
Llamas need strong fences to help them do the job. If a guardian llama 
can’t scare off a dog or coyote with his aggressive attitude, the predator 
may kill him.
Removing poisonous plants
Goats ignore poisonous plants most of the time, but because of their need to 
browse, they may try them just for variety. Whether goats that eat a poisonous 
plant show signs of poisoning depends on how much of the plant they eat, 
what part of it they eat, the condition of the plant (fresh or dried), the time of 
year, and the size and health of the goat. They may have no signs of poisoning, 
or they may get very sick and even die. Chapter 11 tells you how to identify 
signs of poisoning and what to do for a poisoned goat. 
Some of the common poisonous plants that might grow in your pasture or 
backyard include:
 
✓ Weeds
 
• Bracken fern
 
• Buttercup
 
• Common milkweed
 
• Foxglove 
 
• Lantana
 
• Locoweed
 
• Poke weed 
 
• Spurge
 
• St. John’s Wort
 
• Water hemlock and poison hemlock
 
✓ Trees
 
• Cyanide-producing trees such as cherry, chokecherry, elderberry, 
and plum (especially the wilted leaves from these trees)
 
• Ponderosa pine
 
• Yew

66
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Goats 
 
✓ Cultivated plants
 
• Azalea
 
• Kale
 
• Lily of the valley
 
• Oleander 
 
• Poppy
 
• Potato
 
• Rhododendron
 
• Rhubarb
 
Many landscaping plants are poisonous, and a few are so deadly that even a 
few leaves can make your goat extremely sick. Don’t believe the old wives’ 
tale that goats always know what is poison or not. Before you bring your goats 
home, check your yard for these plants. The best resource for doing so is A 
Guide to Plant Poisoning of Animals in North America (Teton New Media), by 
Anthony P. Knight and Richard Walter. You can find many chapters of it online 
at the International Veterinary Information Service (www.ivis.org). I can 
provide only limited information here, and so I recommend you check out the 
Web site and the book to make sure you’re familiar with the poisonous plants 
in your area.
If your goats can get their heads through a fence to the neighbor’s yard, make 
sure that poisonous plants aren’t growing within reach there.
If you find any of these plants, either remove them or make sure that your 
fencing will keep your goats away. If the poison plant is a tree, make sure that 
the leaves won’t fall into the pen in the autumn by either removing the tree 
or situating the pen far from the tree. Dried leaves can be the most deadly 
part of the tree.
You usually don’t need to freak out if one of your goats eats a little taste of 
any of these plants or trees, but you do need to keep an eye on him in case 
he shows signs of sickness. (See Chapter 11 for more about poisons.) I had 
a rhododendron plant in my front yard for years, and when I let the goats 
out they sometimes took a little taste. I found it nerve-wracking and finally 
removed the plant, but none of my goats ever showed signs of poisoning.
 
I recommend that you talk to your neighbors about poisonous plants and ask 
them not to throw their garden trimmings into the yard as a treat for your 
goats without asking first. I lost a goat kid to oxalate poisoning from kale that a 
friendly neighbor had given my goats.

his is where you get serious about getting your goats. 
You read about preparing and designing a shelter, 
gathering basic supplies, and where and how to choose 
the right goats for you. I tell you about training your goats 
and keeping up with routine care.

G
oats need a safe, clean place to hang out, sleep in, or retreat to when 
the weather is too hot, cold, windy, or rainy. The kind of shelter you 
provide varies according to your climate, how many goats you need to house, 
and what kinds of predators you need to protect them from.
In this chapter, I give you some ideas for shelters for your goats, tell you how 
to build a sleeping shelf in an already existing structure, and share some 
ways to keep the areas clean and disease-free.
Outlining Shelter Types
How elaborate your goat shelter is depends on where you live, what struc-
tures are available, how much you can afford, and how many goats you plan 
to have in the shelter. In mild weather, meat goats need only a basic shelter 
to protect them from sun and rain. Some of the things to consider when 
deciding where your goats will live include:
 
✓ Flooring: Dirt or gravel floors are best, although some people prefer 
wood. Dirt absorbs urine, and both gravel and dirt, when covered with 
straw, are warm. Avoid concrete because it’s cold and hard on the goats’ 
bodies, although it’s easier to clean.

70
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
✓ Bedding: Regardless of type of flooring, you need to use some sort of 
bedding for warmth and comfort. (The upcoming section “Bedding and 
elimination of used bedding” gives you more detail about bedding.) If 
you do have to use a concrete floor, make sure to put down 3 to 4 inches 
of wood shavings or straw to insulate the goats.
 
✓ Dimensions: Consider the height and width of the shelter. Goats need 
to have from 10 to 15 square feet of housing if they also have an out-
door area. When building, think about how easy it will be to muck out 
old bedding. Having to bend over or stretch a long way while mucking 
is uncomfortable and hard on you back, so if the goat shelter you build 
won’t be taller than you are, don’t make it too deep.
 
✓ Climate: An open shelter may be fine in a mild, dry climate with good 
fencing from predators, but it won’t work in an area of heavy snow and 
wind or the open range. Make sure that your building is in an area with 
good drainage and, if it is open, that it faces away from the prevailing 
wind.
 
✓ Herd composition: If you have or plan to have a lot of goats, you need to 
make sure you have a large enough structure or plan to build more shel-
ters over time. Groups such as bucks, does, and kids to be weaned need 
separate housing areas.
 
✓ Storage: Remember that you need to have an accessible place to store 
feed and goat-care tools. The area where you store feed must be inacces-
sible to your goats.
 
✓ Access to water: Having easy access to water for your goats is nice, but 
it isn’t critical in most cases. Just remember that if you don’t have a 
water source close to your goats’ area, you’ll be hauling water every day 
for a long time.
 
✓ Other considerations: Regardless of the breed, you need an area for 
doing routine care, such as hoof trimming or clipping. If you are raising 
dairy goats, you can use the same space for milking. In addition, if you 
are planning to breed your goats, you need kidding pens, which can be 
4 feet by 5 feet; the number that you need depends on how many goats 
are kidding at one time. I usually leave my goats with their babies in 
kidding pens for two to three days, and because I have only two, I make 
sure that I stagger their breeding so they each have a place to go.
Using an existing building
Consider buildings that are already on your property and may be feasible for 
housing goats. You can remodel a chicken house or other farm building or 
even use a prefab garden shed for a goat house. Many people house urban 
goats in a section of garage that opens into the back yard.

71
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
Check the building for ventilation — condensation buildup on the inside 
walls will tell you that ventilation is not adequate. Adding a window may 
solve the problem; goats need air coming in above them for proper 
ventilation.
If you have Pygmies or Nigerian Dwarves, you can use the larger dog igloos 
or dog houses for shelters. Kids love them and often snuggle up three to four 
per house. Make sure you have enough to go around, though, because as 
they grow they need more space.
 
If you have a larger building, such as a barn, that you can use for a goat shel-
ter, think about how to organize the space before you start remodeling or 
arranging. Consider where you can trim hooves and give injections and, if 
you have dairy goats, where you’ll milk. You also need to think about grain 
and hay storage. If you plan to breed your goats you also need a kidding pen. 
When you go to farms to look at goats, also look at their setup and freely 
borrow good ideas.
Building a shelter
Goatkeepers have come up with a lot of different ideas for goat shelters. 
These can range from a “Taj Mahal,” if you have space and a lot of money to 
spend, to a very simple shelter when you don’t have land or money. 
Before you build your shelter, find a flat, dry area where the shelter will sit 
level. Don’t plan a shelter next to a fence, or your goats will soon be on the 
other side of the fence. They love to jump on things!
Here are some ideas for simple economical goat shelters that you can build:
 
✓ Used pallets: Figure 5-1 shows a simple three-sided shelter made from 
wood pallets covered with plywood. You can get free pallets from facto-
ries, building sites, large farms, and farm stores. You need to purchase 
two-by-fours, plywood, and roofing materials. The shelter in Figure 5-1 
has a wood floor and a roof made from leftover metal roofing. Two to 
four medium-sized goats can sleep comfortably in this shelter out of the 
rain or sun.
 
✓ Cattle panel and tarp Quonset hut: This kind of shelter can work well 
for meat goats in a milder climate. It is open on both ends. Because 
the heavy cattle panel is strong enough to withstand snow, this shel-
ter could work in harsher climates if you build it next to a barn as an 
adjunct shelter. Directions for building one are at goatseeker.com/
guides/quonset-hut-goat-shelters.

72
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
✓ Dog run: A dog run works well for a few small goats in a back yard. You 
can purchase a cover made with a tarp and in colder weather you can 
put tarps all the way or partly around it. Or you can put in a dog house 
for sleeping quarters. If it is covered on top, and also because of its 
height, it provides nighttime security after you latch the door because 
other animals can’t get over and into it.
 
✓ Wood frame shelter: You can make a wood frame shelter of any size 
and use metal or regular shingle roofing. As long as the area has proper 
drainage, you don’t need to put a floor in the shelter. Just cover the 
dirt with plenty of bedding. You can make this kind of shelter with a 
door, partially enclosed on one side or open on one side. Instructions 
for building a 10-foot-by-10-foot shelter are at www.ehow.com/
how_4550264_build-goat-barn.html.

Providing a Safe, Cozy Place 
for Goats to Bunk
Goats sometimes choose to sleep outside, depending on the weather. But 
they need to have access to a secure indoor area to sleep in, and that’s where 
they’ll sleep most of the time. As long as they have enough bedding (and at 
least one more goat to snuggle with) they can sleep on the ground. But goats 
prefer to be off the ground so they can stay warmer and out of the way of the 
critters that invariably populate the areas where livestock are housed. 

73
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
You meet that desire by building them a sleeping shelf. My goats’ first sleep-
ing shelf was an old church pew, but after several years, the seat disinte-
grated and we had to add a new wooden seat to make it functional. After I 
moved some of my goats to another barn, I noticed that they seemed afraid 
to sleep in their stall. Then I noticed the signs of a lot of rat traffic. Since we 
built them a sleeping shelf they’ve slept in the stall every night.
In this section I tell you how to build a corner sleeping shelf like my goats use.
Building a sleeping shelf 
in an existing barn
You can build a sleeping shelf for your goats in an existing barn, garage, or 
other building. You need very few materials to build it — in fact, you might 
already have the necessary wood left over from another project.
I give you directions here for a triangular corner shelf (Figure 5-2) that we 
built in an old barn on my property. Although the directions are for this spe-
cific shelf, you can modify them to fit your particular building, or you can 
even make one along a full side of your building. This shelf is set 14 inches 
from the ground, which is a good height for miniature and full-size goats. 
These directions assume that the corner of your barn is square.
 
Figure 5-2:

sleeping

Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
An added benefit of a sleeping shelf like this is that kids like the safety of an 
enclosed area where they can’t get stepped on, and they curl up underneath 
it when they aren’t sleeping with their moms.
First, gather your tools and materials:
 
✓ One piece of 5⁄8-inch plywood (4 feet x 8 feet)
 
✓ Four 8-foot 2 x 4s (one for each side brace, one for center braces and 
one for front)
 
✓ One pressure-treated 28-inch 4 x 4
 
✓ Two dozen 11⁄4-inch screws or nails 
 
✓ Two dozen 21⁄2-inch screws 
 
✓ Pencil
 
✓ Level
 
✓ Circular saw
 
✓ Screwdriver (preferably battery- or electric-powered)
 
✓ Hammer
Here’s how you build your shelf:
 
1. Cut the plywood into a triangle with one 8-foot side and two 68-inch 
sides.
 
 Place the plywood with 8-foot side across and measure and mark the 
center of the top (4 feet). Draw a line from each bottom corner to the 
top center line. Each line will be 68 inches long. 
 
 Cut the plywood with your saw along the two lines into three triangles. 
The center piece will be 8 feet on the bottom (full length of the plywood) 
and 68 inches on each side.
 
 You can put the two remaining pieces together to make a second corner 
sleeping shelf, if you want. The pieces you cut from in step 3 brace them 
to make them sturdy.
 
2. Cut your first two 2 x 4s. 
 
 Cut 65 inches from one 2 x 4 and 63.5 inches from another, making a 45° 
angle at one end of each. 
 
3. Cut your third 2 x 4. 
 
 Cut two 42.5-inch pieces with one end of each at a 45° angle. Fasten 
them together lengthwise with five 21⁄2 inch screws, making sure that the 
longer points of the angles are together. (Figure 5-3.)
 
4.  Cut your 4 x 4 in half, creating two 14-inch pieces.

75
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
 
Figure 5-3: 
Sleeping 
shelf frame 
assembly.
 
 
5. Measure and draw a level line 14 inches from the floor on the walls 
where you will set the frame of the sleeping shelf.
 
6. Using two screws or nails, attach the 63.5 inch piece of 2 x 4 (left side) 
to the 65-inch piece of 2 x 4, making a V.
 
 The flat end of the 65-inch piece should be level with the side of the 63.5 
inch piece. (See Figure 5-3.) 
 
7. Attach the 8-foot 2 x 4 to each end of the V piece with two 2-1/2 inch 
screws on each side through the 8-foot piece.
 
 You now have a triangular frame.
 
8. Attach the half-inch support piece to the frame.
 
 Mark the center (4 feet) of the long piece of your triangular frame. 
Attach the combined 44.5 inch piece to the frame with two 2-1/2 inch 
screws or nails on the pointed end and four screws or nails on the flat 
end, with the 45° angles abutting the two shorter pieces and the flat end 
abutting the center point of the front piece. The center of the two pieces 
should line up with your center mark. (See Figure 5-3)
 
 If you want, you can add additional pieces of 2 x 4 to the frame midway 
between the center support and the side to increase the support.
 
9. Place one of the 14-inch 4 x 4s upright on the top corner of the frame 
so that it is perpendicular to and flush with one side. Attach it to the 
frame with approximately six 21⁄2-inch screws at angles starting at 
approximately one inch from the end of the 4 x 4.
 
10. Repeat Step 9 for the front support, with your support piece upright 
and flush with the front of the bottom of the frame.
 
 For additional strength, you can add additional floor supports on each 
side of the frame.

76
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
11. Turn the frame over and place in the corner of your building. Check it 
with a level, then securely attach with a 21⁄2 inch screw every 10 inches 
or so in solid wall. 
 
 If your walls are not square, use shims between the frame and wall when 
attaching the frame.
 
12. Attach the piece of plywood to the top with 11⁄4 inch screws every 8 
inches or so.
You won’t even have to invite your goats to get up on the shelf. Within a few 
minutes after you finish it, they’ll be jumping on the shelf and competing for 
the choice spot.
Using and maintaining bedding
Bedding for goats has two purposes: to provide a more comfortable area for 
goats to walk on and lie down on, and to absorb the goats’ urine and feces. 
You have several options for bedding:
 
✓ Straw: Straw is the bedding I like most. It’s easy to store because it 
comes in bales, and it’s inexpensive. I prefer wheat straw to rye or other 
straws because
 
• It’s easier to muck out when used.
 
• It’s less dusty.
 
• The goats like to eat it when it’s fresh.
 
✓ Wood shavings: Depending on where you live, wood shavings may be a 
better option. If you’re in a region with little rain, you won’t have a prob-
lem with storage, because you can even keep them outside.
 
 When I had guinea pigs I got free wood shavings from a boat-building 
apprentice program. Now I have to buy them by the bag, which is expen-
sive. If you buy them loose by the truckload, storage may be a problem, 
but they are less expensive. I use wood shavings under the straw in my 
kidding pens for extra absorption.
 
✓ Wood pellets: Wood pellets absorb urine and odors but are too hard 
and uncomfortable by themselves for goats to use as bedding. They also 
are expensive. I sometimes use them under my straw bedding in highly 
trafficked areas for extra absorption. They break down and turn into 
sawdust over time.
When the bedding gets saturated with spilled water, urine, and feces it 
becomes a perfect breeding ground for flies and parasites, and must be 
mucked out. Mucking out a barn involves removing all the used bedding 

77
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
down to the floor and replacing it with clean bedding. This helps prevent the 
spread of parasites and other problems.
How frequently you need to muck your barn depends on the size of the area 
and how many goats you have. In the winter, if you live in a cold area, you 
can allow the muck to build up and add new bedding to the top. This pro-
vides extra heat for the goats from the composting bedding under the fresh 
layer. In the summer, you may be able to get away with mucking only once a 
month or so, if your goats spend more time outdoors. 
If you have a large area to be mucked and are lucky enough to have a tractor 
or similar equipment, you can use that. But if you’re like most of us with only 
a back yard or a small homestead, you’ll have to muck by hand. To muck a 
barn by hand you need 
 
✓ Gloves
 
✓ Muck boots or old shoes
 
✓ A pitchfork
 
✓ A wheelbarrow
 
✓ A strong back and arms
 
✓ Country music and beer (optional)
 
Pace yourself. If you have a large area, start on one side and finish that first. 
You can do the other half the next day. I like to have one or two people remov-
ing the used bedding and one running the wheelbarrow.
Use gloves to prevent blisters and muck boots to keep your shoes and 
clothes clean. If the used bedding is very deep, to save your back, take it off 
in layers with your pitchfork rather than trying to lift huge chunks.
Move all of the used bedding to a single pile in a place where goats won’t be 
tempted to play on it. They can get parasites from it. The pile may seem high 
at first, but with rain and time, it will shrink down to nice compost. Some 
people cover their muck pile with a tarp to aid in composting. Because goat 
manure doesn’t burn plants like chicken manure does, you can put it directly 
on the garden, if you choose.
 
If you live in an urban area, be sure to check your city regulations before 
making a large compost pile, especially if it can be seen by neighbors or from 
the road.
After you remove the used bedding down to the floor, sprinkle agricultural 
lime (which helps neutralize the urine), wood shavings, or wood pellets on it, 
if desired, and add fresh bedding.
Put three to four inches of bedding down on a concrete floor; less on wood or 
dirt floors — I put down an inch or two of straw and add more as time goes by.

78
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Keeping Your Goats and Their 
Living Space Clean
Keeping goats healthy includes keeping their living space clean. Luckily, their 
pellets are relatively dry and don’t cause much odor or mess when they are 
healthy. You can’t prevent a goat’s area from getting dirty, because they 
don’t normally think about where they relieve themselves. Still, you can do 
some things to keep their space cleaner.
 
Some people lock their goats out of the barn during nice days, which 
decreases the buildup of used bedding. If you do this, make sure they have 
plenty of water, browse or hay, and shelter from the elements.
If you can’t lock them out you can still do some simple day-to-day cleanup, 
such as sweeping goat pellets off the sleeping shelves, scrubbing buckets, 
and spreading the wasted hay that accumulates by hay feeders to cover fresh 
urine and feces.
Controlling flies and other bugs
Flies, mosquitoes, and other bugs are part of raising livestock, like it or not. 
But you do have some options for controlling these critters. 
The cheapest way to minimize pests is to keep the barn or goat shed dry and 
remove wet bedding weekly during warm or hot weather. Pay special atten-
tion to the areas around water buckets, where the flies are more likely to 
breed.
You can also build a bat house for the outside of the barn or on a nearby 
tree. A bat house is a simple structure that simulates the narrow spot in a 
tree where bats like to live. You can buy one or find plans for building one 
from Bat Conservation International or on Amazon.com. Bats eat mosquitoes 
and other insects, and so having them around is beneficial to a farm. The 
only disadvantage to having bats is that they carry rabies, which a curious 
goat can get from inspecting a crazy-acting bat.
To discourage mosquitoes, walk around your property to check for and elimi-
nate standing water, where they can breed. If you have water that continues 
to build up, just pour some vegetable oil on the top to stop the mosquitoes 
from breeding. Or you can buy a product called Mosquito Free Water from 
livestock supply companies; it’s safe and can be sprayed on standing water. It 
breaks the surface tension of the water, making it impossible for mosquitoes 
to land.

79
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
Some people use insecticides to control flies and other pests, and you can 
find many of them on the market for just this purpose. I avoid them because 
the chemicals are poison that can harm you and your goats. I don’t really 
want insecticide in my milk or meat.
Flies have a two-week life cycle; the larvae develop in the first week, pupate in 
the second week, and then emerge as adult flies. Your fly problem can quickly 
get out of hand in this short time. After more than a decade of raising goats, I 
have tried virtually every non-toxic method of fly control. These include:
 
✓ Fly parasites: You can buy these tiny wasps, which feed on fly larvae, 
from biological pest control companies and some livestock supply cata-
logs. You get them in regular shipments through the mail and put them 
out through the summer near wet areas, where flies are more likely to 
hatch. The parasites are about the size of a gnat and virtually unnotice-
able. Some people swear by this method, but I have found it only some-
what helpful. It is also expensive.
 
✓ Fly strips: These are inexpensive and amazingly effective. You unwind 
these sticky strips and hang them with tacks around the barn. When the 
flies land on them they get stuck. Mr. Sticky is the most effective brand.
 
✓ Mr. Sticky mini roll: This product is superior to fly strips because the 
roll lies horizontally rather than vertically, and so flies are more likely 
to land on it. The mini kit is perfect for a small barn. It is an 81-foot reel 
that you attach to the walls across a stall and roll up as it fills with flies. 
You can also buy a 1,000-foot roll. I think these are the best non-chemi-
cal fly control ever. They cost more than fly strips but do ten times the 
job. I love reeling in all those dead flies.
 
✓ Fly trap: You can find various fly traps on the market. One is a plastic 
bell-shaped trap that you fill with stinky bait and hang from the ceiling. 
Flies are attracted to the smell, crawl in, and then can’t get out. These 
smell bad, so you need to place them where you won’t accidentally walk 
into one.
 
✓ Citronella fly spray: I also use citronella spray, which is made for horses. 
You can spray it directly on goats when they are being bothered by flies. I 
use this only when the deer flies or horse flies are particularly aggressive.
You can try any of these methods, or a combination, to see what works best 
for you.
Feed storage and ratproofing
Always make sure to store your hay, grain, and other feed in a location that 
your goats can’t reach. You also need to keep grain, opened bags of chaff-
haye, beet pulp, and other supplements out of the reach of rats, mice, and 
other vermin. (Chapter 6 tells you about feeding your goats.)

80
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
You can store hay in a loft, in a closed stall with a goat-proof latch, or in any 
other area that goats can’t reach. To keep it from getting moldy, make sure to 
put down pallets instead of storing it on the ground. Galvanized metal garbage 
cans with secure lids make the best storage facilities for other feeds. Rats 
chew through plastic and wood, which makes these materials less useful.
Despite securing feed, rats, mice, and sometimes other animals, such as 
skunks, move into your barn, and into feeding and food storage areas. Any 
grain left in a bowl or feeder or dropped on the floor will entice them.
 
Rats dig holes, chew on wood, plastic, and even electrical wires, and they 
can spread diseases such as leptospirosis and salmonella. They leave their 
droppings everywhere they go. Three kinds of rats can plague the goat barn — 
Norway rat, roof rat, and woodrat. All of them are destructive and dirty.
You can choose to live with rats or fight them. I do both — I live with them 
until their digging gets out of hand or until they become so brazen as to run 
across the room in front of me.
You have several options for getting rid of rats:
 
✓ Barn cats: Cats make good mouse and rat traps. Keep a couple of them 
in the barn and feed — but don’t overfeed — them and they will work for 
you. Older cats are best because they’re bigger and more experienced. 
Kittens can spread toxoplasmosis to goats, so make sure that you neuter 
or spay your barn cats.
 
✓ Live trap: This is the most humane method and one that I use most 
often. The Havahart XSmall works for rats and mice. You can buy one at 
a livestock supply store, a hardware store, or even Amazon.com.
 
 Set the trap with some bait; peanut butter works best. When the rat goes 
for the bait it steps on a part that causes the door to close. When you 
get to the barn in the morning, a fearful or annoyed rat is waiting in the 
cage. You then take it farther out into the country away from human 
civilization, let the rat out, and start over again.
 
✓ Snap trap: Look for the large snapping rat trap (although I’ve inadver-
tently caught a rat with a mouse trap).
 
 Set the trap with some peanut butter. When a rat springs the trap by 
eating the peanut butter, the trap kills the rat. Bury or burn the dead rat 
and reset the trap.
 
✓ Rat poison: You can purchase One Bite rat poison at any farm store. 
Break off a piece of the poison and put it in a rat hole where goats, dogs, 
and cats cannot get access to it. Watch for dying rats over the next few 
days. When you find a dead one, bury or burn it, and put out more bait.

81
 Chapter 5: Home Sweet Homestead: Sheltering Your Goats
 
 This poison is lethal to other animals that eat the dead rats, but I 
haven’t found them to be interested in rats that have ingested it.
 
✓ Garbage can: We smelled decaying animals in the barn for several days 
before my friend found four dead rats in the bottom of an open garbage 
can that had a little dog food in it. After rats jumped in, they couldn’t get 
out. See sidebar “A low-tech rat trap” for another option.
A low-tech rat trap
Rats are scourges to agriculture throughout the 
world. They destroy many crops and spread 
disease. A lot of different rat traps have been 
designed to combat them. Here’s how to make 
one like the farmers in Zimbabwe use:
 1. Bury a five-gallon bucket in the ground near 
a known rat hole leading to your barn or 
goat shed.
 2. Cut off the ends of a corn cob so that it’s 
about 6 inches long.
 3. Push a 40-inch long, thick wire through the 
middle of the corn cob and widen the hole 
so the cob can spin freely.
 4. Center the cob over the bucket; bend the 
wire down on each side at the top of the 
bucket and push the ends firmly into the 
ground on either side of the bucket.
 5. Put 6 inches of water in the bucket and coat 
the corn cob with peanut butter.
 6. Look for drowned rats, and re-coat the cob 
daily.

to Feed Your Goats
In This Chapter
▶ Determining what to feed
▶ Feeding for special conditions
▶ Buying feeding equipment
▶ Making your own feeding equipment
B
efore you get your goats, you need to make sure you have all the 
feeding equipment they need, as well as a stockpile of food. All goats 
need certain kinds of feed — such as a mineral mix — but they have differing 
nutritional requirements depending on their gender and the stage of life 
they’re in.
In this chapter I cover the feed-related equipment you need to buy or make, 
what food your goats need for adequate nutrition, feed alternatives, and how 
to store the feed that you need to have on hand.
Goats Don’t Eat Tin Cans: 
What and How to Feed
Goats are ruminants and have a different digestive process from humans. 
(Chapter 2 explains that process.) Goats also are different from cattle and 
sheep, which mainly graze on grassy pasture. They are browsers, like deer, 
which means they prefer trees, bushes, and woody weeds; rather than 
standing still and eating grass down to the roots, they like to stay on the 
move, eating a bit of this and a bit of that (but not tin cans). Goats can learn 
to graze a pasture, but don’t expect it to be “mowed.” The grass helps 
supplement the goats’ diet, but low grazing also can spread parasites.

84
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Goats have specific nutritional needs, only some of which are met by the 
plants on your farm that they browse on. You have to provide feed for the 
needs that can’t be met by browsing.
 
Unless you have a lot of property with a variety of browse, feed will be your 
biggest expense in raising goats. Don’t scrimp on goat feed — it will pay 
dividends in good health, milk production, and lower veterinarian bills.
In this section I give you a general idea of what and how often your goats 
need to eat for optimal health and production and suggest some special 
treats that will endear you to them.
Understanding the two types of feed
Goat feeds can be divided into two types: 
 
✓ Roughages are high in fiber and come from the green parts of plants. 
They include grasses and browse (leaves, twigs, and shoots) from plants 
such as shrubs or blackberry bushes. (Rosebushes, too, as any goat that 
escapes the pasture will let you know right away.) Hay and straw are 
roughages that have been cut and cured, making them ideal for storage 
and later use. Chaffhaye is a roughage that has the added benefit of 
containing good bacteria that aid in digestion.
 
 Roughages constitute the bulk of a goat’s diet. They are key to a goat’s 
digestion and add bulk to the diet, but they are low in energy (calories).
 
✓ Concentrates are complementary to roughages and are usually referred 
to as grain. They are low in fiber but high in either energy or protein. 
Some are high in energy, others are high in protein, and even others 
are high in both. The concentrates most commonly fed to goats include 
corn, oats, barley, and soybeans. 
Feeding hay and alfalfa
Hay is the main source of nutrients for goats in non-grazing seasons or all of 
the time if they don’t have access to browse. Grass hay provides a moderate 
amount of protein and energy for the goat diet. Legume hays, such as clover 
and alfalfa, usually have more protein, vitamins, and minerals, particularly 
calcium, than grass hays. This varies depending on the maturity of the hay or 
alfalfa and the way that it’s cured and stored.

85
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
Each goat needs about 2 to 4 pounds of hay each day, although some of this 
need can be met by available pasture or other forage. Make it available free 
choice throughout the day when pasture is unavailable or feed twice a day 
when goats are also browsing.
 
You can feed alfalfa (and some grass hays) in pellet form if you don’t have 
storage or if you want to mix it with grain. The goats don’t waste so much 
alfalfa when it’s in pellets, and you can limit who gets it by combining it with 
their grain.
Using chaffhaye instead 
of hay and alfalfa
Chaffhaye is forage in a bag and substitutes for hay. It has been used in 
Europe for many years, but it’s still fairly new in the United States, and you 
can’t find it in some areas.
To make chaffhaye, producers cut early alfalfa or grass, chop it, mist it with 
molasses, add the culture bacillus subtillis, and vacuum-pack it into 50-pound 
bags. The treated hay naturally ferments in the bag, adding good bacteria 
that’s easier for goats and other livestock to digest. It provides more energy, 
vitamins, and minerals than dried hay.
Goats need up to 2 pounds of chaffhaye per 100 pounds of body weight when 
you feed it as an alternative to hay. The nutritional value of one 50-pound bag 
of chaffhaye is equivalent to an 85- to 100-pound bale of good-quality hay. It’s 
easier to store and transport, and each bag has a two-year shelf life.
Chaffhaye is a good option for urban farmers, who don’t have the necessary 
storage for hay or alfalfa, or goat owners in areas where good hay and alfalfa 
are hard to find or overly expensive.
 
If you want to try using chaffhaye instead of hay, I recommend that you start 
small, buying only a little and seeing whether your goats will eat it. Some goats 
love it, but others refuse to eat it.
Feeding grain
Grain or pelleted grain mixes add protein, vitamins, and minerals to a goat’s 
diet. Some are formulated specifically for goats (Purina goat chow, for 
example). Grain options include the following:

86
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
✓ Whole grain: This is the whole, unprocessed grain seed head.
 
✓ Pelleted grain: A product made from grain or grain byproducts milled 
into small pieces and then made into pellets by adding a binding agent.
 
 My goats and I dislike the pelleted feeds — they’re too dusty, aren’t as 
good on the ruminant digestive system as the rolled grains, and 
apparently don’t taste as good, either.
 
✓ Rolled grain: Nutritionally identical to whole grain, rolled grain is simply 
rolled so that it’s flat.
 
✓ Texturized grain: Similar to rolled grain, texturized feed mixes usually 
have other ingredients added to improve nutrition.
I prefer to use a texturized goat feed mixed with barley (which is high in 
calories), although I have used wet COB (high-protein corn, oats, and barley 
with molasses) because it often goes on sale. If you can get enough other 
goat owners together consider working with a nutritionist at the local feed 
mill to formulate your own grain mix. I haven’t tried this because you usually 
have to buy three tons or more and I don’t have that much storage.
 
If you have livestock guardian dogs, avoid feed that contains cottonseed, 
because it can kill dogs that eat it.
Whether you feed your goats grain and how much you feed them depends on 
their purpose, the stage of their lives, their gender, and other factors such as 
pregnancy and lactation. Here are a few guidelines:
 
✓ Kids: You can raise kids entirely on hay and pasture or feed them grain 
for all or part of their first year to maximize growth. This is an individual 
decision based on your herd goals.
 
 If you plan to regularly feed grain to your kids, start them on an 18- to 
20-percent protein grain and decrease that to 16 percent after they’re 
weaned. Give them access to grain in a creep feeder (a feeding area that 
other, bigger goats can’t get to) at all times. (You can read about creep 
feeders in Chapter 13.) Giving kids free-choice grain, which means that 
the grain is available for them to eat whenever they want, helps prevent 
bloat and enterotoxemia because they start gradually and maintain the 
same or only slightly increased levels of feed. (See Chapter 11 for more 
on feed-related diseases.) When you change the volume or type of grain, 
do so over several days to allow the kids to adjust to the change. 
 
✓ Wethers: Wethers are susceptible to urinary stones and don’t normally 
need grain. (The exception is goats that you’re feeding to be large, such 
as pack wethers or meat goat kids.) They do fine on a grain-free diet if 
you give them good-quality grass hay. Even alfalfa can be problematic 
because of the calcium, which causes a certain kind of stone. If you must 
give them treats, select some of the treats I talk about in the section 
“Treats and snacks.”

87
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
 
✓ Bucks: I don’t give grain to bucks except during rut (breeding season). 
They can get run-down and not eat enough when they’re breeding, and 
a little grain gives them much-needed energy. Remember to start slow 
with the grain, to avoid bloat and diarrhea.
Pregnant and lactating doe and senior goats need grain for the energy it 
gives. Read more about diet for these groups of goats in the section “Feeding 
for special cases.”
Following a feeding schedule
 
I feed my goats twice a day, 12 hours apart. At the morning feeding, I load 
them up with grass hay to eat free choice, along with pasture during the times 
of the year that it’s growing.
In order to get goats to use your pasture (if you have one), you need to 
decrease the hay supply or they’ll just stay at the feeder and munch all day.
I give my does alfalfa during the last two months of pregnancy up through the 
time they’re done lactating. (See the upcoming section “Feeding for special 
cases” to find out more about giving a pregnant or lactating doe everything 
she needs.) In addition to the twice-a-day feeding, in the winter when the 
ground is bare or covered with snow, I check the hay in the afternoon and 
refill it if it is empty or low.
I don’t creep-feed but give the kids some grain during the first two or three 
months of life because they’re growing (and I need some bribery to get them 
into the pen for evening lockup so I can get their moms’ milk in the morning.) 
I start with a small amount in a bowl for all the kids to share and gradually 
increase the amount to avoid gut problems.
Choosing organic — or not
If you are a purist and want to make sure that your milk or meat don’t have 
any artificial chemicals in them, in some parts of the country you can find 
organic grain and hay. You may have to put some effort into finding organic 
products, and you can expect to pay more. On the other hand, if you sell 
milk or meat, you can expect to make more money in the market if you use 
organic feed.

88
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Minerals are a must
Goats need supplemental minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients in addition 
to those they get in their hay, grain, and browse. Fortunately, with the 
growing popularity of goats in the United States, more and better mineral 
mixes are available.
Vitamins and minerals are essential to keeping goats healthy, making sure 
they’re growing well, and assisting in reproduction and the development of 
skin and bone. The amounts of minerals and vitamins that goats get from 
their food will vary depending on what hay, minerals, and browse they have 
access to. If you have a large acreage with a variety of weeds and brush, your 
goats get more natural nutrients than goats that are raised in a limited area 
just eating grass hay.
You can supplement your goats’ browse and feed them essential minerals 
and vitamins by supplying them with free-choice loose minerals or a mineral 
block. You can find goat-specific minerals in most feed stores, or you can 
request a special order. Some minerals are formulated specifically for meat 
goats and others for dairy goats. Some have salt and some don’t. Goats prefer 
minerals with salt, but if you have to get a salt-free mineral, supplement it 
with a salt block.
 
Never buy a so-called “goat/sheep mineral” because it doesn’t have enough 
copper for a goat’s needs. The amount of copper that a goat needs can kill a 
sheep.
Expect your goats to consume a quarter-ounce to one ounce of mineral 
mix per day. If you can’t find goat-specific minerals, you can use a cattle or 
horse mineral. Goats and cattle have similar needs for certain minerals, but 
because cattle eat so much more, goats may have a problem eating enough of 
a cattle mineral to meet their needs.
Supplemental feeds
With good hay and an adequate mineral block (and grain for breeding and 
lactating animals), your goats get by just fine. But you can also give them 
some of these supplemental feeds to make them even healthier or, in some 
cases, to save money. Many of them can be left out in mineral feeders or 
bowls so the goats can eat them whenever they choose.
Beet pulp
Beet pulp is a byproduct of processing sugar beets to make table sugar. 
Processors add molasses to the pulp to bind it and keep the dust down and 
make it into pellet form for livestock feed.

89
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
Beet pulp adds fiber, protein, and energy to a goat’s diet and contains calcium 
and phosphorus. It comes in 50-pound bags and is cheaper than grain, but 
doesn’t supply as much energy and so shouldn’t be used as a substitute.
 
Sugar beet farmers started using genetically modified (GMO) sugar beets in 
2008. If that concerns you, you may not want to give your goats beet pulp. 
I use beet pulp pellets in the winter as a supplemental feed. You can hydrate 
the pellets in hot water or feed them dry. My goats prefer them hydrated. 
 
Start by giving your goats a small amount unless you want to be disappointed 
and have to dump it out. The first time in the year that I offer the beet pulp, 
my goats are suspicious and don’t want to touch the pellets, but by the end of 
the season they are fighting to get to them and slurping them down.
Black oil sunflower seeds (BOSS)
Black oil sunflower seeds are a relatively inexpensive supplement to goats’ 
grain. They contain vitamin E, zinc, iron, and selenium and also add fiber and 
fat to the diet. BOSS make the goats’ coats shinier and increase the butterfat 
in their milk. I buy 50-pound bags and mix the seeds into my goats’ grain. 
They eat them shell and all.
Kelp meal
Kelp meal is made from seaweed and is a good source of iodine, selenium, 
and other minerals. Used as a supplement, it helps protect goats from iodine 
deficiency. Kelp also improves dairy goats’ production, increasing milk 
volume and butterfat and helping decrease mastitis.
Kelp meal is expensive, and I can’t always afford it. When I can, I buy kelp in 
40-pound bags and give it to my goats free choice. Because they love it and 
fight to get to it, I have a hard time keeping it stocked.
Baking soda 
Many goat owners offer free-choice baking soda to their goats, which aids 
digestion by keeping the rumen pH-balanced. Because my goats waste it, I 
provide it sparingly.
 
If one of your goats has a digestive problem, offer baking soda. It helps 
balance the rumen pH. Baking soda is also one of the treatments for floppy 
kid syndrome. (See Chapter 13.)
Apple cider vinegar (ACV)
Some goat owners add unfiltered apple cider vinegar to their goats’ water. 
Old wives’ tales abound about how adding ACV to water will lead to the birth 
of more doe kids, but I don’t think it’s ever been scientifically proven. ACV is 
full of enzymes, minerals, and vitamins, so giving to your goats can’t hurt.

90
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Treats and snacks
A lot of people want to feed their goats grain because the goats like it so 
much. But, like candy, just because it tastes good doesn’t mean it’s good for 
you. You can find plenty of other nutritious snacks for goats.
Corn chips are a good grain substitute for wethers, because the saltiness 
encourages them to drink water, which helps prevent urinary calculi. (See 
Chapter 11 to find out more about urinary calculi.)
Fruits are always a good treat for any animal. Goats love apples, watermelon, 
peaches, pears, grapes, bananas (peel and all, if organic), dried fruit such 
as raisins, cranberries, and most other fruits. Just make sure that the fruits 
aren’t in pieces large enough to cause choking.
Vegetables are a nutritious addition to any diet. Goats love carrots with their 
tops attached, celery, pumpkins, squash, lettuce, spinach, and other greens. 
 
Avoid members of the nightshade family such as potatoes and tomatoes, 
which contain alkaloids, and plants with oxalates, such as kale. These can be 
poisonous to goats.
You can also buy commercially produced goat and horse treats for your 
goats.
Using Body-Condition Scoring 
to Fine-Tune Feeding
Body-condition scoring is a way to determine whether a goat is in good health 
or will be a good producer based on its fleshiness. You can use it to determine 
whether you’re feeding your goats enough or too much. 
Like people, some goats are constitutionally fatter or thinner, but no goat 
should ever be at the high or low end of the spectrum. You will invariably 
have a goat that is an easy keeper — that is, no matter how little you try to 
feed her she stays fat. Other goats have the opposite problem.
You can look at a goat from every angle, but without physically handling 
it, you can’t really know its physical condition. For example, fiber goats or 
bucks with long coats may look well-filled-out, but when you feel their bodies 
you find that they’re very thin. I learned this the hard way when I had a buck 
die. He had looked like he was perfectly healthy, but after he died I discovered 
that he was skin and bones covered with a lot of hair.

91
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
To determine body condition, you have to feel certain key points of the goat’s 
body. The ribs and spine are the best indicators of body condition because 
the bones protrude there. Body condition scores (BCS) range from 1 (very 
thin) to 5 (obese). The ideal body condition score is a 3, although goats will 
be at 2 during certain times of the year, such as during rut, when the bucks 
forget to eat and run themselves ragged, or after a doe kids.
You have to practice body condition scoring to get good at it. After all, if you 
haven’t felt many goats, you won’t know what goats are supposed to feel like 
when they’re in optimal condition. So don’t be shy, feel any goats that you’re 
around and try to determine their body condition so you can use this tool in 
fine-tuning your feeding program. Here are the guidelines for scoring a goat’s 
body condition:
 
✓ BCS 1: The goat is emaciated. The ribs, spine, and shoulder blades are 
sharp and pronounced. The space between each rib is quite visible 
because of lack of fat between them. The vertebrae are sharp and 
noticeable. The flanks are hollow and the sternum (above the front legs) 
has very little fat. The loin has no fat covering it.
 
✓ BCS 2: The backbone is well defined but has some fat covering. The ribs 
are visible, but without a sunken area between them, and they’re hard 
to feel where they come off of the sternum. You can feel a fat pad under 
the sternum, which you can move a bit. The loin is evenly covered with 
a small layer of fat.
 
✓ BCS 3: The backbone is well-covered with fat, and the vertebrae don’t 
feel sharp. You can feel a fat pad on the sternum that can’t be moved 
much. The ribs are barely visible, but you can feel them. You can’t 
feel the ribs where they come off the sternum without pressing hard 
and trying to find them. You can feel a smooth, even covering of fat 
over the loin.
 
✓ BCS 4: You can’t see the separate vertebrae in the spine. The sternal fat 
pad above the goat’s front legs is thick and can’t be moved. You have 
to search for ribs and can’t feel the bones as they come off the sternum. 
The loin is covered with thick fat.
 
✓ BCS 5: The goat is clearly obese. You can’t feel any individual vertebra 
or ribs. You may even see dimpling and hanging fat on various parts of 
the body, particularly the sternal region. The loin area may be so thick 
with fat that it jiggles.
If you have only a few goats, they usually are in comparable body condition, 
so adjusting feed intake up or down will help them all to attain the right 
condition. Just adding some grain to the diet of thin goats or decreasing the 
grain, alfalfa, or treats for a fat herd is often all you need to do.

92
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
If you have one goat that’s very thin and is having trouble getting enough 
food, try moving her to a separate pen for a little extra feeding each night. 
If you add grain, make sure to start slowly. If a goat is extremely thin, but 
seems to be eating all right, consider testing for a disease that causes 
wasting, such as Johne’s or CAEV. (See Chapter 10 for more on testing.)
If you have a goat that is clearly obese, you probably find that that animal is 
first to the feed and getting more than his share. Move that goat to a separate 
pen during feeding time and limit his feed.
Feeding for Special Cases
You need an overall program for feeding your goats to keep them at maximal 
performance, but at times you need to make exceptions for certain goats or 
categories of goats. Pregnant goats, milking does, kids, and senior goats need 
special attention and modified diets.
Pregnancy
Pregnant does don’t have increased nutritional needs until the last two 
months of gestation, when the kids do 70 percent of their growing. They also 
need additional water throughout pregnancy. A feeding program for pregnant 
goats includes:
 
✓ Early pregnancy (first 3 months): Feed does to maintain their body 
condition or to improve their body condition if they are thin. You can 
meet their nutritional requirements with good hay or pasture, or some 
added grain for thin does. Unless they’re lactating, does don’t need grain 
in early pregnancy. Do not overfeed. Overfeeding can lead to complications 
such as hypocalcemia and ketosis. (Chapter 12 tells you about these 
conditions.)
 
✓ Throughout pregnancy: Monitor and compensate for pregnant does’ 
increased water consumption. Pregnant goats can drink up to four 
gallons a day. Monitor body condition and adjust feed accordingly.
 
✓ Late pregnancy (last two months): Does’ nutritional requirements 
increase greatly during this time, because the unborn kids are growing 
rapidly. Start grain gradually (just a handful a day) until your does are 
eating up to a half-pound of grain a day (depending on the goat size and 
breed) or half to two-thirds of their normal milking ration by the time 
they kid, in addition to hay. Gradually replace their hay with alfalfa so 
they get the proper balance of calcium and phosphorus. Continue to 
monitor their body condition and adjust feed accordingly; does carrying 
multiple kids need even more calories and nutrients.

93
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
 
Make sure not to overfeed grain during pregnancy to avoid the risk of having 
the kids grow so large that the doe has birthing difficulties.
Milking does
Milking does, or does that are nursing their kids, have higher nutritional 
needs than other goats. You will have started your pregnant goats on grain 
and gotten them used to eating a substantial amount of grain during the last 
two months of pregnancy. Continue this feeding, even increasing it to several 
pounds a day, according to the doe’s body condition and the number of kids 
she is feeding or the amount of milk she is producing. Also, make sure that 
she is drinking plenty of fresh, clean water.
Kids
Kids have different needs than adult goats because they’re growing. If you’re 
raising meat goats, you want good weight gain and so should feed the kids 
grain. Check out the sections “Feeding grain” and “Feeding frequency” for 
specific kid-feeding plans.
Old goats
Senior goats often need special feed because they’ve lost teeth and have 
trouble chewing, and so have a hard time getting the calories they need. 
Sometimes you don’t notice they have a problem until they get really thin.
Chaffhaye is great for senior goats because its high water and bacteria 
content make it easy to chew and digest. Another option is senior horse feed 
or calf manna, a pelleted feed with proteins to increase growth and easily 
digestible carbohydrates for more energy. Some people have had good luck 
using either of these after soaking in water.
Getting the Basic Supplies 
As soon as you know you’re really going to get some goats, you need to figure 
out what and how many you need of each of the basic feeding equipment 
items. I talk about minimum requirements for these supplies in this section.

94
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Bowls
You need feed bowls for grain, unless you just have a few wethers, who 
shouldn’t eat grain. Feed bowls come in all sizes, shapes, and materials. You 
can find nice plastic or metal wall-hanging feeders with single or multiple 
sections. You can make your own out of wood — or metal, if you have the 
necessary equipment and skills. I use 5-quart plastic feed pans (a feed pan 
has a flat bottom, which makes it less likely than a bowl to tip over) to feed 
kids and the large 3-gallon plastic feed pans to feed adults when I feed in 
groups. I use a stainless steel bowl for feeding does that are being milked on 
the milk stand because I found one that fits. See Chapter 14 for more on milk 
stands. Some milk stands come with a bowl.
Buckets
Goats drink a lot of water and unless you have a nice, clean creek running 
through your property, you need buckets or a stock tank (a large watering 
tank made for livestock). I prefer buckets to a stock tank, which is a lot larger 
and doesn’t have to be filled as often. I like the buckets because they’re 
easier to clean, and goats are notorious for refusing to drink water if even a 
piece of hay is floating on it.
I don’t know of any rule of thumb regarding how many buckets you need per 
goat. It depends on how often you clean and refill them. At my farm, the goats 
get new water two or three times a day. I recommend starting with at least 
one bucket for every two or three goats (unless you have a huge herd) and 
seeing how that works before investing in more.
 
Buy dark-colored buckets. Algae is less likely to grow in a dark-colored bucket.
When I got my first goats I bought five-gallon buckets, thinking that they 
would work better because they held more and would have to be refilled 
less frequently. That worked great for about five years and then (not letting 
on how old I am) I realized that my back and arm couldn’t handle carrying a 
five-gallon bucket. So I switched to the two-gallon size. Now I can carry one in 
each hand, which is still heavy, but at least I’m in balance.
In my experience, plastic buckets have only about a five-year lifespan. Over 
time, they crack and break. So consider that when planning your budget.
For the first three years I had goats I didn’t have a nice barn, much less 
indoor plumbing for the goats. So I had to carry water from the house to the 
barn. If you live in a cold climate, you need to keep two things in mind: goats 
prefer hot water, and hoses freeze. If you don’t have a hot-water supply in or 
near your barn, plan to carry buckets of water several times a day.

95
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
If you have electricity in your barn, you can buy a plug-in heated bucket in 
either two-gallon or five-gallon size, or a submersible heater that can be put 
right in the bucket. These are a must in a cold climate, unless you want to 
refill buckets throughout the day.
Water supply
Goats need a consistent supply of fresh, clean water to grow properly, stay 
healthy, and do their best in milk production. Pregnant and lactating does 
have the highest water needs, and when the weather is hot and dry, all goats 
need more water. A general rule of thumb is between a half-gallon to four 
gallons each day per goat.
Using a human-made water supply
You can get by without a nearby water supply, but if your barn is any 
distance from your house, you’ll find that hauling water and equipment back 
and forth is a lot of work. Plan ahead, even if it means digging a water line 
when you put in a new goat shelter or barn.
Even better is a sink and faucet with hot water — a dream that came true 
for me about five years into raising goats. Now I can wash feed bowls and 
buckets without schlepping them to the house. And with dairy goats and the 
equipment they require, it’s even more useful. I don’t have to get quite so 
mad when they step in or kick over a bucket of milk because I can clean up 
and start over.
At a bare minimum you need a hose that reaches the barn or area where the 
goats hang out. Even with just that, if you don’t want to be at the beck and 
call of goats or if you actually have to leave the farm once in a while, you 
can use a stock tank and buy a float valve to attach to the hose. When the 
water is low, the valve opens to allow enough water through to refill the tank. 
Rubbermaid makes an inexpensive one that livestock supply stores carry.
Using a natural water supply
Some people are fortunate enough to have a creek or a pond that goats can 
use for a water supply. Both are convenient but have the disadvantage of 
being more liable to become contaminated, either from urine, feces, and 
debris or from becoming stagnant. If you plan to use either of these sources, 
get the water tested first to determine whether it’s safe for drinking. If you 
are on a city water source, talk to your water supplier about how to do this. If 
you have well water, you are responsible for its safety and can contact your 
local health department for information on getting it tested.

96
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Mineral feeder
Supplemental minerals are a must for goats, so you need a mineral holder or 
feeder to put them in. Look around your local feed store and ask other goat 
owners what they use. First you need to decide whether you will provide 
loose minerals or a block.
Loose minerals come in a bag and can be poured into a feeder; a mineral 
block is minerals that are compressed into a hard block using molasses to 
hold them together. Mineral blocks withstand moisture better because they 
already contain a certain amount of moisture in the molasses.
With loose minerals you have a variety of choices for equipment. I tried 
feeding pans that attach to the fence with limited luck. My kids figured out 
pretty quickly that they could jump up and stand in them, which contaminated 
the minerals. Some of the goats also like to paw at them when eating. 
A good alternative for feeding loose minerals is a polypropylene mineral 
feeder, which you can get from a livestock supply catalog or store. It is 
sturdy, and kids can’t stand on it.
You can find plans on the Internet for making a mineral feeder out of PVC 
pipe. This is an inexpensive alternative to a purchasing a mineral feeder 
and works well, if you install it securely. Goats are really hard on anything 
attached to the wall. I tried these feeders, but my goats eventually knocked 
them down.
I use minerals in a block now because my goats like them better. You can buy 
a holder designed specifically for mineral blocks, which even has holes in the 
bottom to allow moisture to escape. I’ve used them, but they also have a fatal 
flaw — they have no cover and so are easily contaminated.
I hadn’t seen any mineral block holders that had a cover, so I had my friend 
Bob design one for me. You can make one of your own with the instructions 
at the end of this chapter.
Hay feeder
Any goat person will tell you that goats are terrible hay wasters. New to 
goats, my friend Bob spent hours conceptualizing the perfect hay manger 
that would prevent this waste, only to discover within a week that the floor of 
the goat shed was inches deep in hay. I’m not convinced that the perfect hay 
manger or feeder exists.

97
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
 
I don’t recommend a keyhole feeder — one that has a larger opening at the top 
where a goat can put his head in, and a narrower opening where his head 
rests when he drops it to eat. The goat is unable to pull his head out of the 
narrower opening, which prevents wasting hay but can cause damage or 
death to a goat that gets bashed from the side by a more aggressive goat.
I’ve also tried a homemade wooden, V-shaped open-top hay manger. It was 
set off the ground on legs, with slats on top in a V-shape down the middle. 
Within an hour after I set it out, a goat jumped into the hay on top and got 
stuck. I recommend that if you get one of these feeders, you put a top on it. 
That will keep goats out and if you feed outdoors, a top will keep rain and 
snow off of the hay.
Now I use two different types of hay feeders — a sheet metal box frame 
feeder that I can move and hang on any fence, and a large round feeder 
made from cattle panel. (See instructions for making the round feeder in the 
section “Building a Simple Hay Feeder,” later in this chapter.) 
The box feeder is a rectangular box with slats going across the top of the 
front to the bottom of the back. When goats pull out hay, some of it drops 
into the bottom of the feeder, so not as much is wasted. The round feeder 
has openings at different levels all around so goats can stick their heads 
through to get hay.
I keep the large feeder in the barn where most of my goats live and smaller 
ones in the smaller areas where I keep bucks, wethers, boarders, or goats in 
quarantine.
You can buy a poly plastic version of the box frame feeder I use at some feed 
stores or online at www.enasco.com. Make sure not to buy the kind that has 
an open bottom or has the bars so widely spaced that hay can fall out.
 
You need at least one box feeder for every four goats. The round feeder can 
easily feed 8 to12 goats at a time, depending on their size and temperaments. 
Often one or two goats drive others away from a feeding area, so I like to make 
hay available in at least two locations in each goat area. That way everyone 
gets to eat.
Storing feed
You can store hay anywhere that’s dry, sheltered, and separate from your 
goats so you can dole it out. (If goats have free access to hay they will eat or 
spill it all.) A section of the barn or a storage building is best, although I had 
a friend with limited storage who kept a quantity of hay outside on pallets 
covered with a tarp.

98
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
Unless you live in a very dry climate, make sure to carefully check the hay 
before using it because it can get moldy when stored outside. Mold can cause 
sickness or even kill goats.
Chaffhaye is a little easier to store than hay because it is vacuum-packed so 
it can withstand the weather better. You can store it in a barn, a garage, or 
even outside on a pallet.
 
You need separate containers to store bags of grain, sunflower seeds, and 
other concentrated feeds such as beet pulp because they attract rats. The rats 
on my farm are so persistent that they even chew through plastic, so I use 
30-gallon galvanized steel garbage cans. One can holds two 50-pound bags of 
feed. I loop a bungee cord through the handle on the lid and attach it to the 
side handles to ensure that it stays closed if a goat manages to get into the 
feed storage area. The best way to prevent goats from getting into feed is to 
store the feed in an area where the goats can’t ever get to it.
Building a Simple Hay Feeder
The simple feeder in Figure 6-1 is easy to make, easy to use, and holds 
enough hay to feed 8 to 15 goats (depending on their size) for several days. 
You probably want to use it for only 10 goats or so, however, because they 
may start fighting when eating in such close proximity.
The only problems I’ve had with this hay feeder is that the goats sometimes 
tip it over when it’s empty, and every so often three goats (kids, usually) 
stick their head through the same panel and get stuck when they try to pull 
back at the same time. You can attach the feeder to a wall or post to prevent 
goats from tipping it over, but doing so limits the number of goats that can 
feed from it because they don’t have access to the part of the feeder that’s 
against the wall.
You can make a 38-inch-diameter circular hay feeder from a cattle panel. If 
you want a larger one, use a longer section of cattle panel. Remember that 
the goats have to get their heads to the hay in the middle, so don’t make it 
too wide.
You need only a few tools and materials for this hay feeder:
 
✓ A 16-foot section of cattle panel
 
✓ Bolt cutters
 
✓ A metal file or a grinder
 
✓ Heavy wire, fasteners, or zip ties

99
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
 
Figure 6-1: 
A simple 
homemade 
hay feeder.
 
Follow these steps to put together your hay feeder:
 
1. Using your bolt cutters, cut a 10-foot length from the cattle panel.
 
 Make sure to cut at the end of a section so that no metal ends protrude. 
 
2. File or grind any sharp parts.
 
3. With another person helping, roll up the section of panel until the two 
edges meet.
 
4. Secure the ends together with zip ties, strong wire, or metal fasteners. 
 
5. Place the feeder in the desired area, fill it with hay and watch your 
goats go for it!
Building a Mineral Block Holder
You can buy a mineral block and put it in a bowl or a holder designed for 
mineral blocks, but you will soon be frustrated. Goat kids love to jump up on 
anything and everything, and mineral blocks are no exception. All goats will 
relieve themselves when the fancy strikes them — even if they’re standing 
near or over a mineral block. This means that your goats’ mineral block will

soon become contaminated with urine and feces, directly and from little feet 
grinding into it.
My friend Bob came up with a really simple idea for a wooden mineral block 
holder that keeps the mineral block off the ground and also covers the top of 
it, so when those kids start jumping they just land on wood. (See Figure 6-2) 
You can buy the wood for this, or make it from pieces you have lying around. 
The inside dimensions (101⁄2 inches) are important because that’s the minimum 
required to hold a standard-size mineral block. (You can make it larger, if you 
want.) You need a solid post or wall to attach it to. 
To make the mineral block holder you need the following equipment and 
materials:
 
✓ Hand saw or circular saw
 
✓ Drill
 
✓ Pencil
 
✓ Yardstick or other measure
 
✓ Carpenters’ square
 
✓ Level
 
✓ One eight-foot long untreated 2 x 6 board
 
✓ One sheet of 3⁄4-inch untreated plywood
 
✓ 56 3-inch deck screws
 
✓ 12 11⁄2-inch flat-head screws
To make your own mineral block holder, follow these steps:
 
1. Measure your 2 x 6 and mark with pencil at 12-inch intervals.
 
 Use the carpenters’ square to make sure the ends are even. (Note: You 
can make the top section from a 2 x 4, but you need to use a 2 x 6 for the 
bottom so the mineral block can rest on it.)
 
2. With your saw, cut eight 12-inch pieces from your 2 x 6 for the sides.
 
3. Measure your plywood.
  
• Mark two 131⁄2-inch by 131⁄2-inch pieces for the top and bottom 
 
• Mark two 61⁄2-inch by 16-inch pieces for the top and bottom braces
 
4. Cut all the pieces of plywood. 
 
5. Using eight screws (two for each corner), screw together four of the 
12-inch 2 x 6 pieces to make a 131⁄2-inch square. 
 
 To make the box square, make sure each piece of wood is attached on 
the inside on one end and the outside on the other. 

101
 Chapter 6: Dinner Time: What and How to Feed Your Goats
 
6. Attach the first piece of plywood to the top of the square with 12 
screws. 
 
7. Assemble the bottom section by repeating Steps 5 and 6.
 
8. Using a level to ensure that it is even, attach the top and bottom 
sections to the post or wall with eight screws each so the bottom of the 
top and the top of the bottom are 16 inches apart.
 
 Attach the bottom piece 14 inches from the ground or higher. The 
plywood should be on top for the top piece and on the bottom for the 
bottom piece. Don’t situate it too high or too low for your goats to 
comfortably eat the mineral.
 
9. Place the top brace with one end inside the top section against the 
center of the front piece of the 2 x 6 and the other against the post at a 
45° angle and attach with three screws on each end. 
 
10. Place the bottom brace with one end under the front 2 x 6 piece of the 
bottom section and one end against the post at a 45° angle and attach 
with three screws on each end. 
 
 To make a better fit, you can cut the end of each brace in a 45° angle.
 
11. Set the mineral block snugly into the bottom section.

Chapter 7
Getting Your Goats: Choosing, 
Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
In This Chapter
▶ Finding goats to buy
▶ Knowing which goats are right for you
▶ Using a sales contract
▶ Getting them home safely
I
knew before I got goats that I wanted a dairy breed, and I always assumed 
it would be Nubian because I liked the way they look. Then I spent two 
years after I bought my farm learning everything I could about goats and 
finally decided to buy two Nigerian Dwarves.
After several false starts — from driving through pouring rain unable to find 
the farm where I hoped to get my first goats to missing out on the goats I’d 
planned to get because someone else bought them first — I got lucky and 
bought two does from a breeder who went on to mentor me for many years. 
(My partner refused to turn around when we had trouble finding that house!)
You might get lucky and find the perfect goats on your first attempt. But if 
you don’t, just keep trying. This chapter takes you through the important 
points to consider when selecting goats, finding them, picking healthy ones, 
and closing the sale. 
Choosing the Right Goats for Your Needs
Nothing is worse than buying some goats, bringing them home, getting 
attached to them, and then discovering that they won’t work out in your 
situation, are the wrong type, or aren’t what the seller represented. In this 
section, I talk about some characteristics to consider when looking for goats 
to buy.

104
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Goats need company
A lot of people make the mistake of getting only one goat. It’s a mistake 
because goats are herd animals — they live and move in groups and respond 
to each other’s cues — so they need each other. One goat does not a herd 
make.
I got two does for my first two goats because I knew I wanted to milk and I 
could handle two goats and a few kids. If you’re getting a larger breed or want 
to start slow with pets or brush eaters and, maybe, eventually start milking, 
consider getting a doe and a wether — sister and brother, because they know 
each other well. Which brings me to another goat characteristic: they get 
bonded to their family members.
I’ve heard stories of goats that were separated for years and then recognized 
each other when reunited. I sold two goats from the same herd to a farm, 
where they were initially kept in different areas. When they were together 
again, one followed the other around and cried when they were apart, even 
though they were different breeds and hadn’t been particularly good friends 
before I sold them.
 
You’ll have a much easier time if you buy a pair from the same herd and, 
unless you want them to be unrelated for breeding purposes, from the same 
family. They adjust more quickly if they’re with someone they know.
Size matters
Unless you have unlimited space and feed, you need to consider the size of 
the goats you get. If you live in the city or have a small acreage, consider 
small breeds such as the miniature dairy breeds for milk, the kinder (a 
Nubian/Pygmy cross) for meat, or the Pygora (Pygmy/Angora) for fiber.
On the flip side, bigger is better in the evolution of some breeds. If you are 
raising Nubians or some of the meat goats, you want large or well-muscled — 
but not fat — goats. (See Chapter 6 to find out about body-condition scoring.) 
You can learn more about ideal size of the breed you are considering from a 
breed club (an association focused on a specific breed of goat).
Horns can hurt
Even if you object to removing horns, think carefully before you bring home 
a goat with horns. (Chapter 9 gives you the pros and cons of disbudding, or 
removing horns.) Horns can do more than cause physical pain to another 
goat or person; they can also hurt your pocketbook when you have to 
replace a fence, pay for a lawsuit, or pay medical or veterinary bills.

105
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
Find out whether the breed you want is one that is normally kept horned. 
Fiber sheep, for example, need horns because the horns provide them with 
natural temperature control in the heat. Some meat goats are also not 
normally disbudded.
If you get a breed that is normally disbudded or polled (naturally hornless), 
keep in mind that if you plan to breed them and sell kids, they may not be as 
easy to sell if they still have horns. You also won’t want to keep horned and 
hornless goats together because they aren’t evenly matched and the hornless 
goats will lose any battle. Horns, especially on miniature goats, are often at 
eye height, and a careless toss of their head at a fly or other annoyance can 
injure your eye. You may also get tired of cutting your goat’s head out of the 
fence repeatedly.
Registered or unregistered
A registered goat is one that meets the standards of appearance for its breed 
and is recorded in the herdbook of the goat association for that particular 
breed. A registered goat usually is a purebred but may be a crossbreed 
(called an American or an Experimental.) See Chapter 3 for more about 
crossbreeds.
If you just want a couple of goats to love, spend time with, and use for help 
keeping down the noxious weeds, then you don’t really need registered goats. 
Registered goats cost a little more, but they aren’t necessarily any better.
Registered goats have some advantages over unregistered goats. They are 
required to have identification such as a tattoo or a microchip, which can be 
helpful if they are stolen. Registration also gives you some assurance that the 
goat is the breed and has the potential the seller claims. Registered goats are 
more valuable, so if you want to sell surplus kids you can usually get more 
money for them than for unregistered ones. And most goat shows require 
entrants to be registered. 
Most registries also have a complaint process, so if you believe that a seller 
has acted unethically and contradictory to registry requirements, you have 
somewhere to turn besides the courts.
Looks count: The basics of conformation 
In goatspeak, conformation refers to correctness of the body structure as 
compared to the ideal standard. Judges consider conformation when judging 
goats in a competitive show and appraisers look at it to determine how well 
a goat represents the breed. Knowing a bit about criteria for the ideal goat of 
the type you want helps when you’re selecting goats for your herd.

106
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Goats potentially live longer, are healthier, and are more productive if their 
structure and udder attachments are correct. They kid more easily if their 
rear ends and back structures are sound, milk more if their body capacity 
and width are good, and so on. These criteria are basically the same for all 
types of goats, with an emphasis on the udder for dairy goats, muscling and 
length of loin for meat goats, and type and fineness of fleece for fiber goats.
You’d need a whole book to cover the variations in conformation standards 
among different types of goats (and such books have been written). 
Appraisers use the following characteristics to determine whether a goat has 
good conformation:
 
✓ Masculinity for bucks and femininity for does
 
✓ Set and correctness of legs
 
✓ Shape of head
 
✓ Length of body
 
✓ Udder attachment 
 
✓ Muscling (in meat goats)
 
✓ Level topline (the line down the back of the spine)
 
✓ Shape of scrotum
 
✓ Width of chest
 
✓ Width of escutcheon (area between back legs)
Goat registries certify individuals (usually judges) to appraise dairy goats — 
giving them a score based on their conformation and how they compare to 
written standards. Before you purchase goats, ask the sellers whether they 
have had their goats appraised and if so, whether they will share that 
information with you.
 
If you are interested in finding out more so you can more knowledgeably 
select goats for your herd, I recommend that you read further on conformation 
for the specific breed you want. Dairy Goat Judging Techniques (Dairy Goat 
Journal), by Harvey Considine and George W. Trimberger, is the book on dairy 
goat conformation, but it is out of print and hard to find. You can get information 
on conformation for other types of goats online.
Finding Sources for Goats
Finding goats isn’t hard. When you start looking for them, you’ll see them 
everywhere. I recommend that you first try to find goats close to home. 
Doing so enables you to visit the farm and see the goats before you agree to 
purchase any.

107
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
If you’re looking for a rare breed or have very specific needs, finding the 
goats you want locally might be a little harder, but take your time and use 
some of the resources I talk about in this section. After you get a lead, call or 
e-mail that person and ask about his goats. If you’re still interested after that, 
plan a visit to his farm to see his herd and the goats he’s selling.
Visiting local feed stores
You’ll be spending a lot of time at your local feed store getting the supplies 
you need for your goats-to-be and then continuing to buy feed and supplies 
after your herd is established. Get acquainted with the proprietors. Although 
the bigger chain stores are frequently cheaper and carry more products, 
mom and pop feed stores are a great resource. They are usually willing to fill 
special orders or help you find an elusive product that you’re having trouble 
locating.
Often the owners or clerks at the feed stores know the farmers in the area 
who shop there and are willing to direct customers to them. (They may even 
be the farmers you’re looking for.) They also usually have a bulletin board 
with livestock and farm-related ads, business cards, and flyers — a good 
place to start in your search for goats.
Reading the agriculture paper or thrifties
I’ve had mixed luck with the regional agriculture paper and the thrifties or 
nickel ads. I’ve found goats advertised in them, but I’ve also had very few 
inquiries when I advertised there.
Nevertheless, these publications are a good place to start looking for goats 
for sale in your area or a short drive away. The agriculture newspapers 
have the added advantage of writing about livestock and may even feature a 
breeder with just the goats you are looking for.
Checking out Craigslist
Craigslist, an online service for buying and selling, jobs, and personal 
connections, is a good resource for finding goats locally and often at a 
competitive price. I use it regularly and always get responses, even if I don’t 
always sell the goats I’m advertising.
To use Craigslist, you just go to the site for your city or a close city and look 
in the farm and garden sale section. Craigslist is also a good place to find 
farm equipment and fencing that people are selling for a good price.

108
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Surfing breeders’ Web sites
You can find people who breed the type of goat you want by going directly 
to their Web sites. Just search for the type of goat you want and the word 
breeder. You’ll find a number of Web sites, usually with pictures, pedigree 
information, and sales pages. Some breeders also include information on 
their management practices and helpful hints for raising goats. 
Unless you want to pay for shipping, narrow your selections to nearby 
breeders. If the breeders you find aren’t local, ask them about reputable 
breeders or people they’ve sold goats to in your region of the country or for 
other resources. 
Joining registries and goat clubs
If you’re sure you want to buy a specific breed, join the breed club or the 
registry for that breed. A breed club promotes the breed they’re interested in 
and sometimes sponsors shows. A registry is usually a nonprofit association 
that keeps a herdbook on goats. When you join, you get a member handbook 
or contact information for other members who have the type of goat you 
want.
Joining a registry has some other advantages:
 
✓ You pay less to register your goats. Most registries have a fairly high 
price for nonmembers to register and a more reasonable one for 
members.
 
✓ Registries have written standards that you can use to evaluate goats 
that you might buy.
 
✓ They may host shows, special sales, linear appraisal sessions, herd 
testing or other events.
 
✓ They often have a complaint process if you’re cheated or victimized by 
a seller. They don’t take action on your behalf but do provide notice of 
unethical sellers.
Even if you don’t plan to register goats, these organizations are a good way 
to get in touch with breeders. Like a lot of breeders, I sell some of my goats 
unregistered for a lower price.
 
You may also be able to find a local or regional goat club to join. These clubs 
often offer a newsletter and sponsor shows. They may also hold conferences 
to educate goat people and give them a chance to network. When you talk to 
people selling goats that you’re interested in, ask them about what clubs or 
goat-related organizations they belong to.

109
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
Going where goat people congregate 
Your next county or state fair is likely to have a goat exhibit, which is a really 
good way to find out more about goats, look over some goats, and network 
with other goat people. Goat exhibitors use the fair as a place to acquaint 
people with their animals and to market them. 
In regions with a large goat population — Texas comes to mind — goat shows 
happen quite frequently. Read the paper, watch the feed store bulletin board 
ads, ingratiate yourself with goat owners, and find out when a show will 
occur. 
Some areas also have an annual goat day or goat conference. For example, 
the Northwest Oregon Dairy Goat Association (NWODGA) has an educational 
goat conference every February. Few goats are sold there, but people network, 
offer goat products for sale, have a raffle, and often hand out sales brochures. 
It’s a good venue to meet goat people and find out more about goats that 
they or others are selling.
Making Sure You Get a Healthy Goat
Just as you wouldn’t want to buy a car with a bad transmission or a dog that 
you know has hip dysplasia, you want to make sure that goats you purchase 
are healthy and aren’t going to rack up a lot of vet bills (unless you’re 
interested in rescuing mistreated or sick animals). In this section I share a 
number of techniques that help you determine whether a goat is in good 
health.
Asking questions
You can find out a lot just by asking questions. Then you can further pro-
tect yourself by making sure that the claims made about the goats are in a 
sales contract. (The upcoming section “Protecting Yourself with a Contract” 
gives you the goods on getting a contract.)
Ask the following questions to help determine whether a goat is healthy:
 
✓ What diseases do you test for? What kind of results have you had with 
testing? (See Chapter 10 for more about testing.)
 
✓ Do any of your goats have a transmissible disease? How do you handle 
that? (See Chapter 11 for more about common diseases.)
 
✓ What is your feeding program for newborns? (See Chapter 13 for more 
about newborn feeding.)

110
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
✓ What vaccinations do you do? (Chapter 10 tells you more about 
vaccinations.)
 
✓ Have you had any goats die from an undiagnosed illness in the past few 
years? What happened?
 
✓ Have you had a history of abortion in your herd? Explain.
 
✓ For meat goats: What kinds of market weights do you get for your goats? 
 
✓ For fiber goats: How much fiber do you get on average from your goats 
and what type and quality is it? (See Chapter 15 for more about types of 
fiber.)
 
✓ For dairy goats: Are you on milk test? How much milk do you get from 
the goats or their dam or buck’s dam? 
 
✓ What do you feed your goats, including minerals? (Chapter 6 tells you 
more about feeding goats.)
 
✓ Will you give me the names of three people you have previously sold 
goats to?
If the goats you plan to purchase are located too far away to visit, you won’t 
be able to examine them or the herd they’re coming from. Besides getting 
answers to the previous questions, you can take a couple more steps before 
agreeing to purchase them:
 
✓ Ask specific questions about characteristics that you might find on 
examination. For example, “Does this goat have any defects or has it had 
any illnesses?”
 
✓ Ask for pictures of the goat from different angles.
 
✓ Ask for copies of any health records on the goat.
Examining the goats
If you live close enough or can afford to travel, go to the seller’s farm to see 
the goats. Ask to see the goats that you’re interested in purchasing (or if they 
aren’t born yet, to see their dams) and any health records the seller has. You 
can use this opportunity to check not only for sickness but for quality. Spend 
some time on the farm, evaluating the goats and talking to the seller about 
feeding and other management practices.
Look at the goat from a distance, observing how it moves and whether it 
limps or favors any leg. When you get to the goat, check its body:

111
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
 
✓ Evaluate its weight. You need to put your hands on the goat to determine 
whether it’s bony, fat, or average weight. (See Chapter 6 for more about 
body condition scoring.)
 
✓ Check the body for any lumps, swellings, or other abnormalities.
 
✓ Look for extra, split, or micro-teats.
 
✓ Notice whether the coat is dull, dandruffy, or missing patches.
 
✓ Check the eyes and nose for crustiness or mucus.
 
✓ Look for signs of diarrhea.
 
✓ Pull down the lip and check the gums for anemia. (The gums should be 
pink.)
 
✓ If the goat is lactating, inspect her udder for lumps, disproportion, or 
pendulousness. Ask to milk her if you’re purchasing her for milking.
Observing the home herd
Observe the rest of the herd while you are at a farm to get an idea of how 
the goats look overall. (This will also give you an opportunity to see how the 
owner has set up her goat area and barn and get some ideas.) 
Look for the same things from a distance that you’re checking on individual 
goats you’re interested in. And make sure that
 
✓ The herd looks well-nourished.
 
✓ The goats are ruminating.
 
✓ The pens are passably clean.
 
✓ Sick goats are isolated from well goats.
Protecting Yourself with a Contract
The days of handshake agreements aren’t entirely gone, but they’re on their 
way out. Never assume that the other party to a goat sale hears what you’re 
saying. People usually hear what they want to hear, whether good or bad. As 
a result, proving an oral contract can be difficult, if not impossible.

112
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
I’ve bought and sold goats without contracts over the years, and I have been 
burned only once. But once is more than enough. To make sure that both the 
seller and the buyer are agreeing to the same things, you need a contract. 
In my experience, most goat sellers don’t understand the importance or 
necessity of contracts.
Putting together a basic contract is likely to fall to you, and doing so is 
important for making sure you get what you want and what the seller says 
you’re getting.
 
One case where you won’t be able to make a detailed contract is when you 
buy goats at auction. If you buy a goat at a livestock auction, don’t expect any 
assurance that that goat meets even minimum expectations. People take their 
unwanted animals to auctions, so avoid those goats if you want to make sure 
to get quality, health, or any other guarantee.
A contract is a legally binding agreement that creates an obligation to do or 
not do a particular thing. It puts in writing the agreements made by a buyer 
and a seller, helps prevent misunderstandings, and protects both parties in 
the event that they have a later disagreement or conflict. A written sales 
contract needs to include at least
 
✓ The effective date of the contract
 
✓ The names and addresses of the buyer and the seller
 
✓ A description of the goat, including
 
• Name, if applicable
 
• Breed
 
• Gender
 
• Whether the goat is registered
 
• Whether the goat is for breeding or not
 
✓ Payment terms, including
 
• Price
 
• Deposit to be paid
 
• Date(s) for other payments
 
✓ Health certificate and testing information, including
 
• Party responsible for health certificate, if required
 
• Tests already done and results
 
• Party responsible for the testing, if not yet done
 
• Outcome if tests are positive, for example, exchange/replacement 
of goat or refund

113
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
 
✓ Outcome if goat is infertile, if sold as breeding animal
 
✓ Action to be taken if doe sold as bred is not pregnant
 
✓ When seller’s responsibility for change in goat’s condition ends and 
buyer’s starts — usually when transport begins or goat changes hands
Ask breeders or check the Internet for goat sales contracts. Many breeders 
include them on their Web sites. You can use one that has already been 
written and make the necessary modifications for your situation.
Bringing Your Goats Home 
The way you move your goats from their old to new home depends on where 
you buy them. If you purchase your goats from a breeder who lives across 
the country, the breeder is responsible for getting the goats to a shipper, 
and all you have to do is find out where to pick them up. You normally are 
responsible for the cost of shipping and a health certificate, even when the 
buyer does the legwork. If you bought the goats from a neighbor and they are 
trained to lead, getting them home will be simple — just put them on leashes 
and lead them home. If you’re buying goats in any other situation (and you 
probably are), you need to figure out in advance how to get them home. 
In this section I discuss how to transport your new goats, the effects of 
transportation on goats, and what to do when you get them home.
Transporting your goats
You can transport goats in a variety of ways, depending on their size and 
how many you’re moving at one time. If you can, avoid putting goats in a 
large area where they can more easily fall or get injured. Also, if you won’t 
be moving your goats in a temperature-controlled environment, avoid 
transporting in extremely hot or cold weather.
Some of these methods won’t work for large goats, but you can transport 
goats in
 
✓ Pet carriers or crates with straw or wood shavings for bedding. If you’re 
moving the goat in an open truck bed in cold weather, cover the crate 
with a rug or tarp to keep the wind down and keep the goat warmer.
 
✓ The back of an SUV, van, or the back seat of a car. I cover the seat with 
a tarp and towels for those invariable “accidents” that occur during 
transport.

114
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
✓ On the towel-covered lap of a passenger. Goats that are being held and 
aren’t standing up will not pee on you, but they will poop.
 
✓ The back of a truck with a canopy. Make sure to put down plenty of 
straw.
 
✓ A horse trailer or another trailer with fencing or cattle panels to make 
it high enough to prevent escape. Cover an open trailer in extreme 
weather conditions to protect the goats from rain and wind.
 
Regardless of how you transport your new goats, to make the trip as 
stress-free as possible, do the following:
 
✓ Load the goats carefully.
 
✓ Make sure they have adequate bedding or padding.
 
✓ Start, stop, and take turns or curves slowly and smoothly.
 
✓ If your trip will take many hours or days, provide the goats with hay 
during the trip and stop every 3 to 4 hours to let them eat, drink, and 
regain their equilibrium. If you want to turn some heads, you can even 
take a lead-trained goat out for a walk at a rest area. (“What kind of dog 
is that?”)
Quarantining new goats
If you’re getting your first goats, you don’t have anyone to quarantine your 
new goats from. You just get them situated in their new digs. But if you’re 
adding goats to an existing herd, you need to quarantine the new goats for 
at least 30 days, if at all possible. This means that you need an area with 
adequate shelter that completely separates your herd from the new goats. 
Quarantine protects the other goats from any unknown or undisclosed health 
problems that the new goats might have.
During the goats’ quarantine time, do the following:
 
✓ Have them tested for CAEV or any other diseases you want to test for, 
unless the seller has provided you with documentation that the goat 
has been tested and had negative results. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
routine testing.)
 
✓ Observe the goats for signs of any disease such as soremouth lesions or 
abscesses. (See Chapter 11 to find out about common ailments.)
 
✓ Watch how the goats adjust to your feeding and management program.
 
✓ Do a fecal analysis and deworm if necessary. If you’re unable to do a 
fecal analysis, routinely deworm all goats in quarantine.

115
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Goats: Choosing, Buying, and Bringing Goats Home
Watching for signs of stress
Even when you start with healthy goats, transporting can stress them 
emotionally and physically. Emotional stresses include
 
✓ Leaving their mothers and friends
 
✓ Losing their standing in the herd and having to establish a new position
 
✓ Being in unfamiliar surroundings
Physical stresses can include
 
✓ Being moved to a transport vehicle
 
✓ Prolonged standing in a moving vehicle
 
✓ Temperature extremes, rain, and wind
 
✓ Lack of exercise
 
✓ Insufficient food and water intake
 
✓  Crowding or being moved with unfamiliar goats
 
✓ Being bullied by more aggressive goats
At best, the stress of shipping only causes a goat to have a depressed appetite 
and not seem quite herself, but she snaps out of it in a few hours or days. 
Remember, she has to adjust to a new environment away from the security of 
everything she has ever known.
Blood tests show that a goat needs about three hours after being transported 
to stop having a physical stress response, but the move’s effect on the goat’s 
immune system can last longer.
 
At its worst, the stress of transport brings on what is known as shipping 
fever — causing pneumonia and sometimes diarrhea. Signs to look for include 
temperature of over 103.5° Fahrenheit, nasal discharge, coughing, rapid 
breathing, or rattling in the chest. Contact a veterinarian if your new goat has 
any of these signs.
To minimize the effects of transport stress, give the goat plenty of water 
(warm or hot if the weather is cold and spiked with molasses if she isn’t 
drinking), goat Nutri-drench, and some probiotics, and watch him closely.
Watch for bullying that seems excessive or dangerous, as they redetermine 
their status in the herd or among the new goats, and separate the bullies.
Eventually you can expect the new goats to settle in to their surroundings 
and be back to their normal selves.

W
hen you get a fix on goat dynamics and start working with and train-
ing your goats, you’ll be amazed at how easily they learn. If you’re 
new to goats, though, you might need some time to figure out what to expect 
from them. (They need to adjust to you, too.)
In this chapter, I tell you which goat behaviors are normal, how to work with 
and train goats in basic and more advanced tasks, and how you make sure 
they have proper supervision. I also give you fun ways to keep your goats 
active.
Identifying Normal Goat Behavior
I love studying the social aspects and idiosyncrasies of other animals. 
(People could learn a lot from them about how and how not to get along.) 
Human and goat dynamics actually have a few things in common.
Goat herds have a set structure, with leaders and followers. Some goats are 
decision-makers, and others go along with the decision. Sometimes goats find 
interesting ways to exercise power.
I had a goat with kidding problems: Some years she couldn’t get bred and in 
others, her kids died during or shortly after birth. She loved kids, though, 
and developed a habit of staying with all of them while the moms and other 
goats went out to browse each afternoon. She was the only “auntie” goat I’ve 

118
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
ever met. Other goats carry their urge to nurture a little further, even going 
so far as to steal a kid from another goat. And many a kid, especially one with 
two or more siblings, will take a suck from any teat in sight. 
Besides the behaviors I discuss in this section, goats have a habit of checking 
things out with their mouth. (This is probably where they got the reputation 
for eating everything.) Never put health records or registration papers near a 
goat if you want to keep them. I’ve even had goats chew up ribbons they won 
at the fair.
Establishing a “pecking” order
 
Like chicken flocks (and our society for that matter), goat herds are hierarchi-
cal. Might rules, but so does nepotism. Sometimes you may feel inclined to 
intervene in your goats’ bad behavior, but don’t do it unless someone is get-
ting hurt. Goats set the rules, and you can’t change them without damaging 
the goats.
Mostly, you won’t see your goats intervening in bullying either, lest they 
become the target. I have known a couple of does that walked between two 
fighting does, as if mediating the dispute. This behavior usually occurred 
before a fight really got going.
Bow to the queen
Every goat herd has a dominant female, known as the herd queen. She usually 
leads the way and decides when to go out to pasture. She gets the best sleep-
ing spot, the primo spot in front of the feeder and, if she is a dairy goat, she 
gets to be milked first.
If another goat tries to change things, beware! The herd queen won’t like it 
and will let the other goat know by her behavior. (See the section ”Butting 
and biting.”)
The herd queen’s kids are royalty by birth. The herd queen lets them share 
in the best eating spot next to her. She will defend them if any other goats try 
to get them out of the way. Unless they are challenging her for position, the 
only time other goats seriously take her on is if she is bullying their kids.
The herd queen has responsibilities, too. She tests new plants to determine 
whether they’re edible and she also stands off predators. When a new dog 
comes on my property, the herd queen is often in the front of the herd, snort-
ing and threatening to butt. My original herd queen, Jinx, once charged at 
and butted a cat she didn’t think belonged in the barn.
The herd queen usually retains her position until she dies or until she 
becomes old and infirm and another doe fights and wins the position.

119
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
The head buck leads
The head buck is the counterpart to the herd queen. He is usually the biggest 
and strongest (and often the oldest) buck. In my herd, the head buck is a 
Nigerian Dwarf who is smaller than his Oberian herdmates. He took over the 
position when the prior head buck died. He had been second in the hierarchy 
and the Oberians — who were destined to become bigger — were young and 
smaller than him, so he was able to maintain his position.
In the wild, the head buck takes up the rear of the herd, defending against 
any danger coming from behind.
Bucks also fight for the top position but, like the herd queen, a buck retains 
his position as head buck until he dies or a younger, more dominant buck 
challenges him and wins when the head buck gets old.
Biting, butting, and mounting
Goats sometimes communicate by biting. Some don’t bite at all and others 
bite a lot. For the first few days after I sold a milking doe, Daisy, to another 
farm, the owner called me, distraught. She reported that Daisy was biting 
all of the other goats. She said she couldn’t keep her because she was afraid 
her goats would get hurt and would start biting. I put her off each time, and 
within the first week the biting had stopped. Daisy was just trying to estab-
lish her place in the herd — near the top — and it worked. After that, she had 
no reason to bite.
Boys will be boys
When I was in high school, we had a hallway 
that was referred to as senior hall. Boys, mostly 
seniors, would line the hallway and give a hard 
time to girls who had to pass through the hall to 
get to class. I dreaded going down that hall, not 
knowing whether I was going to be insulted or 
even groped. I had a flashback to that time one 
day when I was observing my goats.
I watched from my house as a teenage doe 
escaped through the fence and trotted down 
the road toward an area where she could find 
blackberries, apples, and other goodies. As she 
approached the fence line that separated the 
bucks from the does, she slowed down and 
then stopped. Ahead of her were four heads 
sticking through the fence. The adult bucks 
were lined up, snorting, slobbering, and making 
all kinds of noise to attract (or sexually harass) 
her. She decided to chance it and rushed by, 
as far away from them as she could get. Senior 
hall all over again!

120
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
Like biting, butting serves a role in the goat world. Goats butt to bully others 
out of their way, to establish their place in the herd, as a form of play, or to 
fight, often during rut.
Butting is one reason that keeping horned and dehorned goats together is 
unwise. The dehorned goats are at a distinct disadvantage and can be seri-
ously injured. Unlike sheep, who run at and ram each other, goats normally 
rear up on their back legs and come down to butt.
Goat kids start mounting each other even when they’re only a few days 
old. They are practicing to be grownup goats, but they’re also attempting 
to establish dominance. As they get a little older, the mounting takes on a 
sexual connotation.
Goats, both male and female, respond to sex hormones by mounting each 
other. Mounting behavior tells you when a goat is in heat, especially if you 
have a wether in the herd. You can use him as an indicator of a doe in heat, 
just like a buck rag (a rag rubbed on a stinky buck, which a doe in heat 
responds to).
Establishing a place in the herd
The most common reason for butting and biting is to establish a place (as 
high as possible) in the herd.
When I let one of my first two goats out of her kidding pen for the first time, 
the other doe immediately started fighting with her. They butted heads until 
they were bloodied. I had to separate them and then try again, because the 
first time Kea was attempting to take over as herd queen. The second time I 
let Jinx out, she and Kea butted heads a few times and then Kea stopped. Jinx 
had maintained her position.
When you introduce a new goat to the herd, the lower-status goats are usu-
ally the first to fight. They want to maintain or raise their position in the 
herd, and the newbie is a threat.
Playing
Goat kids often butt each other, but usually gently. They use butting as a 
form of play, as they learn how to be goats. The same is true of mounting 
behavior. They are playing at being grownups. They are also trying to estab-
lish their role in the hierarchy.
 
Sometimes you see goats just rear up and come down, rather than hit heads. 
They don’t hurt each other, so don’t try to stop the behavior when it is 
directed at another goat. On the other hand, if they exhibit this play behavior 
with you, do not allow it. A goat, especially a buckling, who is allowed to butt 
humans as a kid will grow into that mean goat you always hear about that’s 
unsafe to be around.

121
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
Fighting
Goats fight over food and during rut. Goats, especially those with higher 
status in the herd, butt or even bite others when they perceive competition 
for food or, if they’re bucks, for the opposite sex.
 
Watch bucks during rut to ensure that they’re safe from each other and to 
separate them when they aren’t. I had a buck, Black Bear, whose rear leg was 
broken by a relentless and aggressive buck during breeding season. (He got 
around on three legs after that and even managed to climb a fence and breed 
a few of the does in his impaired state.) You also need to make sure not to 
turn your back on a buck during this time because they also can be aggressive 
toward humans.
Conducting Basic Training 
with Your Goats
You don’t want goats that live up to the stereotype of stinking, butting, and 
being generally untrustworthy. And routine care is a lot easier if your goats 
have some basic training and are used to being handled. Even if you don’t 
want show goats, you can get more enjoyment from goats that don’t run 
every time they see you.
In this section I tell you about teaching your goats some basic manners, give 
you tips for handling goats, and show you how to use a collar to control your 
goats.
Collars are not just decorations
Collars are a useful tool for handling goats. They’re necessary for showing 
a goat or getting it from one place to another, like in and out of a vehicle for 
transport. A collar is essential for restraining a goat when grooming, unless 
you have a milk stand (a piece of equipment that a goat stands on with her 
head secured), also sometimes called a stanchion.
A collar can be anything from a piece of baling twine to a plastic chain link 
collar to a fancy silver choke chain, depending on the situation and your 
budget. If you have only a few goats, you can buy collars at the local pet 
supply store. If you have a larger herd, consider purchasing from a pet or 
goat supply catalog, which gives discounts for bulk orders.

122
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Measure your goats’ necks before buying collars so that you get the right 
sizes. Standard collar sizes are
 
✓ 22 to 24 inches for an adult doe
 
✓ 26 inches or more for a buck
 
✓ 14 inches for a kid
 
For first-time goat owners I recommend the plastic jumbo chain-link collars 
sold by goat supply catalogs and some hardware stores. These come in 20- or 
40-inch lengths that you can size to fit each goat. Goats can wear these collars 
all the time, because if a goat gets his plastic collar caught on something, the 
links break apart.
As you get more comfortable with your goats, consider using a regular dog 
collar when you need to control a goat and letting it go collarless the rest of 
the time.
 
Goats that wear collars all the time are at risk of choking if the collar gets 
hooked on something.
Handling goats regularly
Goats need regular handling or they can get wild. A wild goat will run from 
you, struggle when you handle it, and try to get away at any chance. This 
kind of behavior presents a problem when you need to groom it or do rou-
tine maintenance and care, such as hoof trimming or vaccinating. Nothing is 
worse than having to chase down and capture a sick goat or having to drag 
and lift it into a vehicle for a vet visit.
On the other hand, a goat that is handled regularly knows you are in charge 
and is more likely to come when called or at least not hurt your back or arm 
trying to get away.
A goat’s initial comfort with being handled depends on its age, its tempera-
ment, whether it was bottle-fed, and how much it was handled before you 
got it. The more you handle a goat, the easier it is for both of you — the goat 
won’t fight and you won’t risk getting hurt. Plying the goat with a treat such 
as peanuts doesn’t hurt, either.
Here are some important things to remember when you start handling a goat:
 
✓ Goats duck their heads to get away, so keep the goat’s head up to main-
tain control. You can do this by holding the goat’s head up with one 
hand under the chin and one on the top of the neck or by holding the 
collar up. Be careful not to choke your goat with the collar.

123
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
 
✓ To catch a fleeing goat, grab the back leg. Catching a goat by a front leg 
may break the leg.
 
✓ Avoid chasing a goat. You can stress him out, leading to other problems. 
Try luring him with food instead.
 
✓ To handle a horned goat, firmly grasp the base of the horns to lead her.
 
✓ If you expect a veterinarian visit, catch the goat in advance. Restrain the 
goat in a pen or by tying her to a fence.
 
✓ Use treats to lure a goat that is resistant to handling. Peanuts, carrots, 
or apple chunks are good choices.
Walking goats on a lead
Lead training is essential if you’re planning to show your goats. A jumping, 
fighting, or recalcitrant goat doesn’t fare well in the show ring. (See Chapter 
16 for more about showing goats.) Even if you don’t show goats, teaching 
them how to walk on a lead makes them easier to manage.
When you lead train, try to recruit a helper to gently push the goat from 
behind when it stops walking. To lead train, take the following steps every 
day for at least 10 minutes:
 
1.  Put a collar on the goat.
 
 Make sure it isn’t too tight or so loose that it slips over the goat’s head.
 
2. Attach a lead and position the collar.
 
 The collar should fit at the top of the goat’s jaw area and behind the top 
of the head.
 
3. Walk forward a few steps, pulling slightly on the lead.
 
 If the goat follows, continue walking. Stop every few steps and reward 
the goat with a small treat or praise. Then start again. Gradually 
increase the distance the goat has to go to get the treat.
 
 Do not drag the goat or pull too hard on the leash because it can block 
the windpipe and cause the goat to collapse. The goat will drop to his 
knees, sometimes exhibiting what appears to be a seizure, but will 
recover quickly. 
 
4. Stop after a few steps if the goat stops, and then try again.
 
 Use a treat such as peanuts, apple chunks, or corn chips to encourage 
the goat to walk.
 
 Lead the goat; don’t let the goat lead you. If the goat is leading well but 
tries to go past you, say “Stop” or “Get back,” then stop and turn in the 
opposite direction. When the goat is stopped by the rope, wait a second, 
and then start to lead in the direction you turned.

124
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
5. When the lesson is complete, lead the goat back to the herd and 
remove the collar and lead.
After a goat is more comfortable walking on a lead, you can practice less fre-
quently. Use this method to get the goat to the stanchion for routine care or 
just take her on an occasional walk on a lead.
Teaching basic manners
Goats need basic manners so they don’t hurt you or someone else, especially 
if they have horns. Jumping up is one bad goat habit and butting is another. 
When I had my first kids, I let the buckling, Harry Potter, jump onto my back 
and shoulders when he was little. He was so cute! Then one day I was out in 
the barn in a tank top when suddenly I felt sharp hooves and a weight on my 
back. Now that he was bigger, it wasn’t so cute. I broke him of the habit by 
sitting with my back to a wall when I went in the barn, so he had no target to 
jump on. Needless to say, I never let another goat jump on me.
My daughter inadvertently taught the same buckling that jumped on my 
shoulders to butt people when she played with him by pushing on his head. 
Years later, when I went into the buck pen during rut, Harry Potter reared 
up and came down right on my hip bone. I avoided serious injury, but I kept 
my distance after that. Now I tell visitors not to push on goats’ heads, even 
in fun. 
 
For mannerly goats, follow these tips and share them with any visitors to your 
goat herd:
 
✓ Never push on a goat’s head. Pushing simulates butting and teaches the 
goat that butting humans is all right.
 
✓ Never let a goat kid jump on you or anyone else. It won’t be a small kid 
forever, and those hooves hurt!
 
✓ Don’t let a goat stand with its front legs on you. The goat will eventually 
get bigger and can knock you down with those front legs.
 
✓ Lead-train your goat for basic handling. Doing so lets your goat know 
who’s in charge.
 
✓ Don’t let children chase your goats. Being chased makes the goats more 
fearful and potentially harder to handle; it can also make them sick from 
stress.
 
Do not let children ride the goats. In addition to making them more fearful, 
being ridden can break their backs. Goats are not built to carry people.

Moving Up to Advanced Goat Training
Goats are very smart and, despite their independence can be taught to do 
much more than follow on a lead or come when called. Start training when 
goats are kids if you want to succeed with advanced training. Older goats 
can sometimes learn tricks or to pack, but they’re more resistant than 
younger ones.
 
Training success depends on your spending a lot of time with the goat and 
being consistent with your teaching.
In this section I tell you how to teach your goats tricks with a clicker, how to 
housebreak goats, and how to teach them to pack or to pull a cart. 
Teaching tricks with a clicker
You can teach a goat to do almost anything with clicker training, a positive 
reinforcement technique that was developed to train dogs. (You can learn 
more about this method at www.clickertraining.com.) 
You need a clicker, which is a mechanical device that makes a click sound, 
and treats such as peanuts or flakes of cereal. By combining the click with a 
treat, you reinforce that the goat is doing the right thing. You need to start by 
getting the goat to make a connection between the clicker and a treat. To do 
this, click the clicker and then give the goat a treat about 20 to 30 times. Your 
goat begins to associate the clicker with food and eventually responds to just 
the clicker so you don’t have to supply a treat every time.
After you’ve shown the goat that treats are tied to clicks, you can start train-
ing. You train by issuing a command (“Come,” for example), and then clicking 
as the goat does what you want it to do and giving the goat a treat after he 
completes his task.
Of course, the goat won’t follow your command without practice. If the goat 
doesn’t respond to the command or does the wrong thing, you can just say 
“wrong” or another word, and then try again.
Always click as the goat does the behavior and then give the treat. If you give 
the treat first, you risk the goat being caught up in eating and not noticing the 
clicker. Your goal is to have your goat do a certain behavior without getting a 
treat. You can also use this method by clicking when your goat does a normal 
behavior that you want to reinforce — for example, pawing at the ground.

126
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
If you’re trying to teach something more complicated, such as “play dead,” 
break the task into smaller incremental steps, and teach each one. The goat 
quickly learns to associate the action with the click sound and with the treat.
With patience and a lot of treats, you can teach a goat to carry out some sur-
prising tasks. In 1998, Mary Ellen Nicholas wrote in Ruminations: The Nigerian 
Dwarf Goat Journal about her goat Bentley. She trained him to roll over, 
come, fetch, close a door, play dead, wave, pick things up, and “pray” (go 
down on his front knees) using clicker training. She even taught him to pee 
before going into a building.
Using an obstacle course
Goat obstacle courses are popular at goat shows and state fairs. Some 4-H 
groups use them as another way to get children involved with their goats. 
You can train a goat to use an obstacle course with a clicker or just with 
treats and repetition.
Use your imagination to set up a goat obstacle course. You can use hay bales, 
hula hoops, a 2 x 4 held up by two cinder blocks, old tires, or whatever else 
you can think of to get a goat to climb up and over, go around, or jump. If you 
set up a ladder that isn’t too steep, you can also train a goat to climb that.
Housebreaking
Most people would be horrified with the thought of bringing livestock into 
their homes. But baby goats are so cute and doglike in their intelligence that, 
once you know them, you can’t resist. And they can learn not to pee in the 
house, or where they shouldn’t. Pooping is another story, but those goat ber-
ries are dry and easy to clean up.
I know that you can housebreak a goat because I did it accidentally quite a 
few times. I’ve occasionally raised kids in the house for the early part of their 
lives. (I was also lucky enough to have a job that allowed me to bring them to 
work in a crate that I kept next to my desk. Thanks, Jan!) When any of these 
goats would stretch out (boy) or crouch (girl) to pee, I whisked them up and 
out the door to the deck. I didn’t have a clicker and didn’t even know about 
them, but the goats learned not to pee in the house.
I had a friend who knowingly housebroke his goat kid. He put down lids 
from photocopy boxes with newspaper in them. When Malakai started to 
pee, he moved him to the box. Within a few days, the kid was using the 
boxes on his own.

127
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
I don’t recommend raising goats in the house. I think they need to be with 
other goats and outside so they can get used to the climate. And they love to 
nibble on everything, especially paper. (If you want this book to stay in one 
piece, don’t leave it on the table near a house goat.) If you need to raise a 
goat in the house or want to bring your goat in the house from time to time, 
use the methods above or try clicker-training to housebreak your goat.
Preparing goats for packing
You can train any kind of goat for packing, but you’re better off looking for a 
goat with certain qualities. You best choices for pack goats are
 
✓ Large. Dairy wethers are the most highly valued goats for packing. The 
bigger they are, the more they can carry.
 
✓ Friendly and energetic. Pack goats have to work with you as a team, 
and so they’d better like humans. They also need to be able to take on 
the task of walking and carrying supplies.
 
✓ Intelligent and curious. Intelligence and curiosity are good indicators 
that the goat can be successfully trained to pack. They will be in new 
and different situations where curiosity, rather than fearfulness, is 
important.
 
If you’re serious about packing, join a pack goat organization such as the 
North American Packgoat Association (www.napga.org) or an Internet dis-
cussion group so you can learn from others and get more resources.
To train a goat to pack, first make sure that he is accustomed to being han-
dled and is calm. The basic steps for pack training are
 
1. Teach your goat to accept being tied.
 
 This is important because the goat will need to be tied when you stop to 
camp, eat, or just rest.
 
 Make sure your goat has a sturdy collar that isn’t too loose. Tie the goat 
to a gate or fence at back height with a rope or lead that is a foot to a 
foot-and-a-half long for a short period of time.
 
 Stay nearby to ensure that your goat doesn’t get hurt. If the goat 
starts to get tangled up, calmly untangle him and tie him to the fence 
again. The goat should accept being tied up after only a few sessions.
 
2. Teach your goat to follow you.
 
 You will be leading your goat when you pack. Follow the steps in the 
section “Lead training,” earlier in this chapter.

128
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
3. Teach your goat to stand. 
 
 Your goat will need to know to stand when you’re putting the pack 
saddle on him, or at other times on the trail.
 
 When you are lead training and you come to a halt, say “Stand” or 
“Stop.” Pull up on the lead rope if your goat doesn’t stop. Practice this 
repeatedly, rewarding your goat when he complies, until he gets it.
 
4.  Teach your goat to wear a pannier (packing saddle). 
 
 He will need a pannier to carry gear. Otherwise your goat will just be 
hiking, rather than packing.
 
 First, show your goat the pannier and let him examine it. Gently place 
the pad and saddle on his back. Tighten the cinch strap (the strap that 
goes around the goat’s body), then fasten the breast collar (the strap 
that goes in front of the goat’s chest) and, last, fasten the rump strap (the 
strap that goes around his rump). Check to make sure that two fingers 
fit between the goat and the cinch strap. (See Figure 8-1, which shows a 
goat ready for packing.)
 
 Give your goat several opportunities to get used to wearing the pannier 
while it is empty and to go through steps one through three. Take him 
hiking with it empty. Before you load up the pannier to go on a hike, 
determine how much weight your goat can safely carry. A rule of thumb 
is about 10 percent of body weight for a yearling and 15 percent for an 
older goat. Never overload a pack, which can injure the goat.
 
Figure 8-1: 
A pack goat 
can carry 
10 to 15 per-
cent of its 
body weight 
in a pannier.
 

129
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
When your goat is comfortable walking or hiking with a pannier, you can add 
the supplies you need and plan a packing trip. If you’re in a pack goat club, 
you can start with a group outing.
Pack goats can participate in community service activities. In 2009, Goat 
Tracks magazine reported on a volunteer project where goats and their 
owners went into the Modoc National Forest in California to clean up the 
remains of an isolated pot farm that had been busted. They hiked in to a 
steep, brushy area and packed out hundreds of feet of hoses, propane tanks, 
bottles, pots and pans, and pounds of trash.
Training goats to pull a cart
A goat can’t pull a large load because it isn’t built like a horse. Generally, a goat 
can pull about twice his weight, which includes the equipment — harness and 
cart. You first need to teach a goat to pull an empty cart before moving on to 
pulling a cart with someone in it. Take plenty of time with training, and train 
the goat away from other goats and distractions so you can both focus and 
avoid problems.
Goats that pull a cart are called harness goats. As with pack goats, wethers 
are the best goats to train to pull a cart. They get bigger than does, aren’t 
at the mercy of their breeding cycles, and don’t stink like bucks. The ideal 
harness goat is energetic, intelligent, and friendly. He isn’t afraid of strange 
objects and doesn’t whine.
 
Before you train a goat to pull a cart, make sure that he is accustomed to 
being handled and is calm.
Train him on a bridle (the head harness used to steer the goat), using these 
steps:
 
1. Let him sniff and mouth the bridle.
 
2. Put the bridle on his head, tightening all straps. 
 
 Praise the goat and give him a treat.
 
3. Take him for a walk while he’s wearing the bridle.
 
 Do this every day for a week so he can get used to wearing the bridle.
 
4. After he’s gotten used to the bridle, attach the reins.
 
 Take him for a walk and hold the reins so he can get used to them. Now 
he is ready for both.

130
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
After your goat is used to the bridle, get him used to wearing a harness (the 
equipment that the goat wears to pull the wagon). The first time you put the 
harness on him, put his collar and bridle on first. To train him to use a har-
ness, take the following steps:
 
1. Let him sniff and mouth the harness so he gets used to it.
 
2. Put the harness on him.
 
 Tighten the cinch strap, and then fasten the breast strap, and finally 
fasten the rump strap. Praise the goat and give him a treat.
 
3. Take him on a walk, using the collar to attach the lead.
 
 Give your goat several opportunities to get used to wearing the harness.
 
4. After he has gotten used to the harness, attach the lead to the harness 
instead of the collar. 
 
 Intermittently, gently pull on the harness to simulate the feeling of a cart 
being pulled. Praise the goat and give a treat.
 
5. Take your goat on a walk while he is wearing the harness and bridle 
with reins, and teach him to stop, go, and turn to the left and right.
 
 When you want him to stop, say “Whoa” or “Stop.” Pull the reins if your 
goat doesn’t stop. Say “Go” or “Walk” when you want him to go and 
“Left” to go left and “Right” to go right. Practice these commands every 
day for a week or so, rewarding your goat when he complies, until he 
gets it. He may have trouble going in front of you if he has walked by 
your side in the past. Bringing a helper to walk by his side with a leash 
attached to the goat’s collar will make the process easier.
 
6. Practice with a travois (a simple triangular wood frame).
 
 Before you get a real cart, you need to simulate a cart in a safer way. 
Attach a travois to the harness and take your goat through the com-
mands. To make a travois, get two long poles and a shorter pole and 
lash them together into a triangular shape. A travois normally has a plat-
form or netting between the poles, but you don’t need one if you’re just 
getting a goat used to pulling a load. Practice with a travois for a week or 
so before attaching your goat to a cart or wagon. 
 
7. Attach your goat to a cart. 
 
 You can buy a cart from Hoegger Goat Supply (www.hoeggergoat
supply.com) or American Cart and Harness (www.k9carting.com). 
Hoegger Goat Supply also sells shafts to make a regular wagon into one 
a goat can pull. Let your goat look at and smell the cart. When he loses 
interest in it, hook him up and go. (See Figure 8-2)

Supervising Your Herd
Goats don’t need a lot of supervision during the day. Mostly they just need a 
safe place to spend their time, exercise, clean water, and plenty of food.
In this section, I tell you about how to meet your goats’ needs and find a good 
helper or helpers to care for your goats when you aren’t available or need a 
vacation. 
Meeting their social needs
Goats are social animals and like to spend time with other goats and with 
their humans. Goats need other goats to keep them company and meet their 
social needs. If you think that you or your dog can take the place of another 
goat, think again. They need one of their own kind to be around all the time.
And sure, after you have two goats, you can leave them to their own 
devices and check them just twice a day during feeding and water if they’re 
in a safe area. But remember that if you spend time with them, you’ll be 
calmer (goats have a calming effect that I tell you about in Chapter 16) and 
they will be even happier. And you’ll end up with better trained goats that 
really like humans.

132
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Evaluating the time you have to be home
Before you get goats, consider whether you have the time and can be locked 
into the daily schedule of goat care. Many goat owners have full-time jobs 
and can’t be home during the day, except on weekends, and yet they do fine 
with their goats. If you’re in this situation, you need to schedule time to care 
for your goats before and after work. I’ve had to do this at certain times in my 
life. As long as your goats are safe and you leave them plenty of hay and fresh 
water during the day, they’ll be all right.
 
Plan to spend a minimum of a half hour in the morning and a half hour at night 
on routine goat chores. If your herd is very large, or if you have to milk, expect 
to spend more time. Routine goat chores include feeding, changing water, 
cleaning buckets, and watching your goats to make sure they’re healthy.
On weekends or when your schedule allows you need to make time for rou-
tine care. (See Chapter 9.) If you have only a couple of goats, an hour on a 
weekend is adequate for hoof trimming and brushing. Even if they don’t need 
their hooves trimmed, you’ll want to check them out and hang out with them 
or observe them. If you have a large herd, plan to spend several hours on 
weekends.
For specialized activities such as breeding, showing, shearing, or slaughter 
you have to spend many hours with your goats. You can plan to do these 
things on a weekend or during vacation.
 
If you have to be gone during the day and have concerns about how your 
goats will do, find a friend or neighbor who can check in on them or if you can, 
hire a reliable helper. Develop a backup plan before you need the help, just in 
case you have an emergency.
Finding and training a reliable helper
Finding a reliable helper can be a challenge. You may find yourself tied to 
your goats and farm with no time off, unless you have a partner or house-
mate to help out. I’m lucky because I have someone living on my property 
who loves goats and helps me with certain tasks. He can also stay on the 
farm when I have to be away.
Consider having different people to help you do different parts of your goat 
care. For instance, you can hire a person with basic skills to do daily chores, 
but you may want an experienced person to do your milking.

133
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
To find and train a good helper:
 
✓ Ask neighbors, other goat people, and people at your local feed store 
whether they can care for your goats or know someone who would be 
willing to help.
 
 Some teenagers (and even younger children) are more than happy to 
help. One time when I had to be gone for a week, my nine-year-old neigh-
bor milked for me. Of course, I had to teach her first. If you have dairy 
goats, you may be able to find someone who would love to learn how to 
milk and is willing to care for your goats in exchange for milk.
 
✓ Make clear to your helper the number-one rule of goatkeeping: Look 
closely at each goat once or twice a day to make sure he’s healthy. I 
read about a wether that died because the owner’s husband had been 
feeding the goats and didn’t notice that the wether was off by himself 
not eating until it was too late to save him. You don’t want this to 
happen to your goats.
 
✓ Do chores with your helper so she can see exactly how much to feed the 
goats and the steps you take. Point out different goats’ behavior, noting 
individual personality differences among them, so the helper has an idea 
of what to look for. 
 
✓ Have the helper do the chores by herself while you watch. Remind her of 
anything she misses, whether she is giving the correct amount of food, 
or any other important steps.
 
✓ Have the helper fill in or work with you for a day from time to time so 
she can keep up her skills.
 
✓ Be grateful and express your gratitude for the help!
Maintaining Physical Fitness
Maybe you don’t have the time or determination to teach your goats to pack 
or to pull a cart, but they still need to stay physically fit. Goats are into exer-
cise by nature because they’re browsers, which means they’re always on 
the move. As long as they have each other and ample space to move around, 
they can stay physically fit. But why not exercise them in a way that benefits 
you both?
In this section I talk about some things you can do with your goats to make 
your life and theirs more fun.

134
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Walking with your goats
Exercising with your goats can be as simple as taking a walk around the pas-
ture or any other convenient place. 
I love the joyous, sidewise jumping that kids do when they go down a hill, so 
you’ll sometimes see me running down the hill coaxing the kids to run with 
me. Sometimes even the adults get into it, bouncing down the hill.
Practice walking with a lead around the pasture and kill two birds with one 
stone — exercise and training! Or if you’re in the city, take them through the 
neighborhood on a leash (giving a wide berth to the neighbor’s prize roses).
When I first got my goats I lived in a place with a path that led into the 
woods. Every day when the weather was nice we took a hike in the woods, 
which exercised the goats and gave them the browse variety they craved. 
Unfortunately, I now have too many goats to control on that kind of walk (not 
to mention that they would decimate the forest).
Furnishing your yard or pasture with toys
Kids love to play and, like all baby animals, are bursting with energy! You can 
give them a place to expend that energy by putting goat toys in your pasture.
Some suggestions for pasture toys include
 
✓ Wooden spools, like those used for electrical wire. Kids love to jump on 
them. Make sure to cover the hole in the middle or someone will get hurt.  
 
✓ Old tires, the bigger the better. My dad found a huge used tire and imme-
diately thought of the goats. I have videos of them playing king of the 
mountain, jumping on and off, and running in circles around that tire. 
 
✓ Wooden ramp structures. These are easy to make with a wooden base 
and a 2 x 6 or 2 x 8 ramp to walk up to the top. 
 
✓ Old Little Tikes plastic playground equipment. You can sometimes find 
these cheap at garage sales. I have a couple of the picnic tables that my 
goats love to sleep on and under and a play structure with a slide. I put 
them indoors in the winter, and the baby goats love to hide and sleep 
under them.
 
✓ Rocks. Goats have fun jumping and climbing on large rocks, which offer 
a secondary benefit of helping wear down hooves.
 
✓ Plastic storage tubs. Turn the tubs upside-down and kids can jump on 
them. Put them on their side or right-side-up and kids will sleep in them.

135
 Chapter 8: Working with Your Goats
Taking Your Goats to Schools 
or Nursing Homes
Goats, with their sweet temperaments, make good therapy animals. People 
love goat kids, but many of them never have a chance to see one. You can 
help educate people about goats and give them a fun experience by visiting a 
school, nursing home, group home for people with disabilities, or other insti-
tution with your goats. 
Pets, including goats, can help people in a variety of ways. Bringing a cute 
goat to a nursing home can help break the isolation or boredom that some 
people feel. Goats meet the human need for touch when people get to pet 
them. They can even bring up good memories from an older person’s past, 
when they lived on a farm or had goats. If you’ve taught them some tricks, all 
the better!
I’ve taken kids to an afterschool program for first graders, and I’ve also had 
people with developmental disabilities visit my farm and hold and pet goats, 
both with positive results and a lot of laughter.
 
Unless you’ve taught your goat to pee on command or use a diaper and you’re 
bringing him indoors, make sure to keep him off carpet, watch closely to 
prevent accidents, and have a rag or paper towels for quick clean-up. (This is 
another time you’ll be grateful for goats’ pelleted poop — easy clean-up!)
You can involve your goats informally or you can go through a formal pro-
gram. The Delta Society (www.deltasociety.org) has a program called Pet 
Partners that “enables pet owner volunteers to provide services to people in 
their own communities while spending quality time with their pets.”

Handling Routine Care and 
Important One-Time Tasks
In This Chapter
▶ Grooming your goat
▶ Handling hooves
▶ Disbudding kids
▶ Castrating bucklings
▶ Identifying your goats
G
oats don’t require a whole lot of regular or intense care, but the care 
they do require is important to their health and happiness. Some of 
these tasks are a one-time affair, others require regular attention, and many 
are time sensitive — put off castrating a buckling, for example, and you might 
end up with kids you weren’t expecting.
In this chapter I show you the proper way to handle and groom your goat, 
and I walk you through trimming hooves, clipping, disbudding kids, castrat-
ing, and tattooing and microchipping.
Grooming Your Goats
Unless you’re gussying them up for a show, goats don’t require a lot of 
grooming. (Chapter 16 tells you about showing your goat.) Grooming pays 
dividends in the long run — by making the goat feel better (who doesn’t feel 
better with a good brushing?), enabling you to evaluate the goat’s health, and 
giving the goat more experience with being handled.

138
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
Brushing
Brushing removes dandruff or loose hair that some goats get and increases 
blood flow — improving the health of the skin and coat. Grooming a goat also 
gives you an opportunity to check for any signs of illness or disease, such as 
a lump, swelling, or other abnormality. (For more information on these and 
other ailments, see Chapter 11.) At a minimum, brush goats in the late spring 
or early summer, when they’re shedding or throwing off the undercoat that 
kept them warm in the winter. They also are most likely to have acquired lice, 
ticks, or other little critters that normally take up residence in the winter.
Use a firm-bristled grooming brush like you can get in any feed store or live-
stock supply catalog. Hoegger Goat Supply (www.hoeggergoatsupply.
com) carries one that has curry-comb (metal) bristles on one side and tufted 
bristles on the other. It is nice for a fiber goat, where you need to brush and 
remove mats.
Brush in the direction of the coat starting at the neck, then down the back 
and down the sides. Make sure to brush the neck, chest, legs, and abdomen.
Bathing
You don’t have to bathe goats, but doing so helps remove the lice, make clip-
ping easier, and keep your clipper blades sharp for a longer time.
Goats prefer to be washed with warm water but will survive the inevitable 
cold water that is all most of us have available. Use a goat or animal sham-
poo. Caprine Supply has a waterless shampoo that you can use when the 
weather is cold or when you don’t want the bother of bathing.
You can use a collar to secure a baby goat or a goat that you can easily con-
trol. Secure other goats on a milk stand or by putting on a collar and attach-
ing it to a fence. After the goat is secure, just wet it, lather up the shampoo, 
and rinse.
 
If you plan to clip the goat right away, blow-dry its hair. Otherwise, let the goat 
dry naturally. (And hope it doesn’t lie down in any poop!)
Clipping
An annual clipping is a good idea for all goats. Shorter hair helps goats stay 
cooler and allows sunlight to reach their skin, which drives away lice and 
other critters. Choose a day after the cold weather is expected to be over.

139
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
Use electric or battery clippers from a pet-supply store or a feed store. The 
Oster A5 or the Andis Stable Pro clipper are good choices. While clipping, 
check the clippers frequently to ensure that they aren’t getting too hot. Spray 
frequently with a clipper cooling spray or oil as needed. Clean and oil the clip-
pers between each goat, or more frequently, as needed.
If possible, wash the goat before clipping. Clipping a clean coat gives your 
clipper blades the longest life possible. Watch out for dull blades, which pull 
on the goat’s coat and cause discomfort. 
You can clip the beard on a doe for a nicer look, but unless you’re going 
to show a goat, don’t bother trimming its head, which is a real challenge. 
(Chapter 16 tells you how to do it.) Your goat may look a little funny, but a 
hairy head does it no harm. 
Here are the steps to take when you trim your goat:
 
1. Secure the goat.
 
 Hold a baby goat; put an adult goat onto the milk stand with some grain 
or secure her to a fence or gate with a collar and a short rope, and give 
her some grain or hay for distraction.
 
2. Start by trimming the top of the body against the grain of the hair.
 
 Use a 10 blade on the body. If you want the coat even longer, use a comb 
attachment. Use long smooth motions to avoid choppy-looking hair. 
Press on and move the skin over the hip bones and other bony areas for 
a smooth cut.
 
3. Clip the back and each side, and then the legs, neck, and chest.
 
 Move from the areas of longer hair to shorter. Use short strokes on the 
legs and to correct any areas that you missed. 
 
4. Clip the hair that hangs over the hooves.
 
5. If you’re trimming a doe’s udder, do so with a 30 or 40 blade.
 
 You don’t want to take any chances with nicks. Clip to about the middle 
of the belly and under the legs, lifting one leg at a time to get the sides of 
the udder. Hold each teat between the thumb and two fingers to avoid 
nicking as you trim around it. (See Chapter 16 to find out about trimming 
the udder for show.)
 
6. Brush the loose hair off and give the goat a once-over, trimming any 
uneven areas.
 
 You don’t have to do a perfect job (and those bald patches will grow 
out). 

140
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
White or light-colored goats can get sunburned. Prevent sunburn by rubbing 
cornstarch on the exposed areas daily until the hair grows out a bit.
Specialized clipping
Two areas that most people clip more frequently are the tail area prior to kid-
ding and the udder during milking season:
 
✓ Tail to kid: During and for several weeks after kidding, blood and fluids 
stick to the goat’s tail and the coat around the tail. Clipping the hair a 
week or so prior to her due date makes cleanup much easier. Clip up the 
sides of the tail, across the end of the tail to make a short little brush, 
and around the vulva area and inside top of the back legs.
 
✓ Udder: Removing hair from the belly and udder makes the udder easier 
to clean before milking and prevents hairs from falling into the milk. I do 
this when I clip the doe’s tail for kidding and then intermittently during 
milking season. Clip according to Step 5 in the “Clipping” section.
Caring for Hooves
Keeping a goat’s hooves trimmed is one of the easiest, least expensive, and 
most important parts of goat care. Regular trimming takes very little time and 
cuts down on health care expenses in the long term. Imagine if you had to 
walk around with toenails that curled under your toes.
Overgrown hooves can affect the way a goat walks, throwing its body off and 
leading to leg and foot problems. They can also limit a goat’s activity and 
exercise level, leading in extreme cases to decreased food intake because 
walking to get to food is so painful. In wet and rainy weather, goats with 
neglected hooves are more prone to foot rot, which can be a long-lasting con-
dition and create additional problems, as well. (Chapter 11 tells you about 
foot rot and other common ailments.)
 
Always check a back hoof to decide whether it’s time to trim. Front hooves 
wear down more quickly than back hooves because goats use them to paw at 
things.
How often you trim depends on each goat and the conditions it lives in. I sold 
a goat to a woman who said that she rarely had to trim her goats’ hooves 
because the goats spend most of their time in gravel. Be creative and include 
objects that will naturally wear down the hooves — such as large rocks or 
coarse roofing shingles on top a structure they like to jump on. 

141
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
Don’t procrastinate! Check hooves frequently and keep your goat used to han-
dling by routinely trimming hooves.
Preparing to trim
Trimming a goat’s hooves requires very little equipment — a pair of sharp 
trimmers will do the job. Livestock supply stores or catalogs offer trimmers 
(see Figure 9-1) specifically geared to hoof trimming for a reasonable price. 
Some people also use a hoof knife or planer for the pad, but it is not essential. 
I do all of the trimming with trimmers specific to the job, or with rose prun-
ers with a straight edge.
 
Figure 9-1: 
You can buy 
hoof trim-
mers from 
a livestock 
supply 
store.
 
 
For kids, the only supply you need is hoof trimmers. You may cut too deep, 
however, and  having some blood stop powder may make you feel better. (You 
can find it at any livestock supply store.) But, as a goat friend of mine once said 
to me, “No goat has ever bled to death from a cut caused by hoof trimming.” 
Usually, after a goat puts pressure on the foot by standing, the bleeding stops.
You can trim a young kid’s hooves simply by holding him on your lap and 
bending the front foot back or the back leg out. The kid may struggle, but you 
usually win.
Adult goats, just because of their size, need to be restrained in some manner 
for hoof trimming. Ideally you use a milk stand, but an alternative is to put 
a collar on the goat and tie it to a fence or gate with a short rope. Another 
option, which may be less effective depending on the temperament of the 
goat, is to have a helper push it up against a wall and hold it in place.
Trimming the hooves
Trim any hoof that is not flush with the base of the foot A hoof that hasn’t 
been trimmed recently folds over the sides. In cases where it has been 
neglected the hoof will be growing longer in the front and on each side and 
may be malformed.

142
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
Do not try to fix a severely overgrown hoof in one trimming. It took time to get 
that bad and will take time to be corrected.
Follow these steps when the time comes to trim your goat’s hooves:
 
1. Clean the hoof of manure or other debris. 
 
 Doing so helps your trimmers stay sharp longer.
 
2. Lift the foot to be trimmed, bending it back at the knee according to 
Figure 9-2 or Figure 9-3.
 
3. Trim the folded over or overgrown sides of the front wall of the hoof 
one at a time as you see in Figure 9-4.
 
4. Trim the heel gradually so that it is even with the sole. (See Figure 9-5.)
 
 Be careful not to cut too deep. If you begin to see pink tissue, stop. You 
can always trim a little more later. Figure 9-6 shows you a finished hoof.
 
5. Repeat with the other three hooves. 
 
After each trim, disinfect your trimmers with alcohol, and use on the next goat 
or store in a dry place.

 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
Dealing with Horns
Horn care can be a one-time deal — removal of the horn buds, called disbud-
ding, shortly after birth. If horns are not removed early, and you want a horn-
less goat, you need a veterinarian to remove them. The procedure is risky 
and leaves a temporary hole in a sinus within the goat’s skull, which may be 
slow to heal.
The only other time you need to care for horns is if they break or if further 
growth, called a scur), develops after disbudding — usually in a buck. (See 
the section “Preventing and dealing with scurs” for more about scurs.)
Horned or not?
Dairy goats are generally disbudded, although a minority of goat owners 
prefer horns because they believe it is more natural. Fiber goats are often left 
with horns, which are believed to help with temperature regulation, a con-
sideration for animals with a heavy coat. Some meat goat shows also require 
that the animals have horns.
Some people like the fact that you can “steer” goats by their horns. To elimi-
nate some of the danger, they grind down the horns to remove the points 
(called tipping). Tipping can cause excessive bleeding, so I don’t recommend it.
For those who prefer hornless goats, the ideal may be naturally hornless 
goats, called polled goats. The trait for polledness requires that at least one 
parent be hornless.
 
If you are concerned about or are having problems with a horned goat, try 
wrapping the horns with foam and duct tape, or putting polyethylene black 
plastic water pipe over them for padding and protection. (Don’t use this 
method if you see other goats eating the padding, because the materials can 
cause a blockage in the digestive system.)
 
In certain goat breeds, the traits of hornlessness and hermaphroditism (having 
male and female sex organs) are linked. Breeding two polled goats to each 
other can increase the likelihood of producing a hermaphrodite.

146
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
The case for no horns on goats
Disbudding is best for the goat and the owner, for a number of reasons:
 
✓ Horned goats can get their heads stuck in fences or feeders. I have had 
to cut out parts of fences when I was unable to free a goat whose horns 
were stuck. A stuck goat is vulnerable to being butted by other goats 
while having no way to fight back or get away, or to dying in the hot sun 
if left too long.
 
✓ Horned goats are more destructive. They are prone to rubbing and 
banging their horns on structures, fences, and feeders. A horned goat 
can hurt you, your guardian dog, or other goats worse than a disbud-
ded one, particularly if the other goats don’t also have horns. (Imagine 
a horn in your eye, for example. It happens!) You may be liable if your 
goat injures another person with his horns.
 
✓ Because horned goats are not allowed in most goat shows, are more 
dangerous, and are less popular among buyers, their market potential is 
less than that of disbudded goats.
 
✓ If you want to milk a horned doe, you need a milking stand with a special 
head lock that horns can fit through.
When to disbud
Kids need to be disbudded within the first two weeks after birth, and for 
males, as early as two days old. Females usually do not have as much horn 
development as males, so earlier disbudding is not as important. Do not 
put off disbudding for too long, though, because doing so can make the job 
difficult, cause the goat unnecessary distress and pain, and result in horn 
regrowth or scurs.
How to disbud
You have to decide whether to use a veterinarian, have an experienced goat 
friend disbud, or do it yourself.
 
If you decide to have a veterinarian disbud your goats, make sure that he or 
she has experience with disbudding goats. (See Chapter 10 to get the scoop on 
finding a goat vet.)
I had a goat friend disbud my first two kids while I observed. For the next 
round of kids (the next year) I bought a Rhinehart 50 electric disbudding iron 
with a goat tip and did it myself. You need to make sure that you use an iron 
with a goat tip, and not a heavy-duty cattle iron, to avoid injuring the kid.

147
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
I don’t use anesthesia (something that is required in the United Kingdom but 
not the United States) because even though the kid may feel more pain (less 
than 20 seconds) without it, the recovery period is only a few minutes. They 
still vocalize as though in pain with the anesthesia, but then they sleep for 
at least a half hour afterward. After having tried it on several goats, my vet-
erinarian and I are not convinced that they feel no pain. We agreed that the 
stress (to us) of worrying about them waking up did not outweigh the benefit 
(to them) of having no memory of the procedure.
 
Never use a disbudding paste on a goat. Because of their nature, goats will 
rub the caustic substance on each other, which can lead to chemical burns or 
even blindness.
Gathering supplies
Unless you disbud kids under anesthesia, a kid holding box is essential. This 
rectangular hinged box exposes just the goat’s head, enabling you to disbud 
and tattoo without having to hold a struggling body.
 
You can buy a kid holding box from a goat supply catalog such as Hoegger 
Goat Supply or Caprine Supply. You can also buy a metal headpiece and make 
your own box, or you can make a box with a wooden headpiece. Be aware that 
miniature goats need smaller kid boxes than standard goats.
You also need the following supplies:
 
✓ A syringe with 1 cc of tetanus antitoxin which you can get at a feed 
store. This will protect the kid from tetanus for 10-14 days.
 
✓ Disbudding iron from a goat supply catalog. (See Figure 9-7.)
 
✓ Pain reliever. I use the prescription painkiller and anti-inflammatory 
Banamine, which I get from my vet. Aspirin or ibuprofen also do the 
trick, but you need to give them with food.
 
✓ An antiseptic spray such as Blu-Kote, which you can get at a feed store.
 
✓ If the kid is bottle fed, a bottle to comfort it following the procedure.

Disbudding the kid
Follow these steps to disbud a kid:
 
1. Preheat the disbudding iron.
 
 Heat it until the end is red hot — about 20 minutes.
 
2. While the iron is heating, give the kid the tetanus shot and the pain 
reliever, which takes about a half hour to work.
 
3. Restrain the kid.
 
 Position the kid in a kid holding box (Figure 9-8) so that the ear nearest 
the horn bud you start with is tucked back into the kid box. You also can 
recruit someone to hold the kid while you disbud. If you go that route, 
make sure that person is wearing heavy gloves and a long-sleeved shirt) 
so that she doesn’t get burned when the kid struggles. 
 
Figure 9-8:

for disbud-
ding in a kid

4. Clip the horn area with your clippers to expose the horn bud. 
 
 Clipping the hair keeps it from burning and smoke going into your eyes 
as you disbud.

149
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
5. Firmly grasp the goat’s muzzle, making sure it can breathe, and 
evenly apply the disbudding iron to the horn bud.
 
 Hold the iron on the bud while applying firm pressure and gently rock-
ing the iron for eight seconds, keeping the kid’s head immobilized. (See 
Figure 9-9.) For older kids or bucks who have some horn growth, allow 
up to eight more seconds. The kid will struggle and yell, but the process 
is over very quickly. 
 
6. Check to make sure that you have left a dry-looking, copper ring 
around the horn bud. 
 
 Figure 9-10 shows you how a properly disbudded horn looks. If you 
don’t see a copper ring, apply the iron for only another few seconds. 
(If you feel you need to burn more than this, give the kid a few seconds 
break to avoid overheating the skull and possibly injuring the brain.) 
 
7. Remove the part of the bud inside the copper ring with your fingers. If 
it bleeds, you can cauterize it by applying the disbudding iron lightly.
 
Figure 9-9:

kid’s head

ding iron.

8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 with the other horn bud.
  
9. Remove the kid from the box and spray antiseptic spray on the dis-
budded area, taking care to avoid the eyes.
 
Figure 9-10: 
When you 
are finished 
disbudding, 
you see a 
copper-
colored ring.
 
 
When the process is over, give the kid its bottle or put it under its mother to 
nurse. Try not to let the doe smell the kid’s head or she may try to reject it.
Preventing and dealing with scurs
Disbudding burns through the skin and horn bud, stopping the blood supply 
to the horn buds and causing them to eventually fall off, if all goes well. When 
they do grow back, the partial horns are called scurs. Figure 9-11 shows a goat 
with scurs.
The horns can regrow, particularly in bucks, if they are not disbudded early 
enough or well enough. Because the horn grows wider at the base as the kid 
grows, and the growth is faster in bucks, getting all of it can be challenging. 
Some people burn a circle eight, or two circles, at the time of disbudding to 
prevent scurs.
 
Check for regrowth a few weeks after disbudding and re-burn if you see a 
problem developing.
In many cases, scurs start growing long after the kid is too large to fit in a kid 
box or handle easily. In those cases, I just let the scurs grow. During breeding 
seasons the bucks often knock these scurs off while fighting.

151
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
Figure 9-11: 
Horns that 
regrow after 
disbudding 
are called 
scurs. 
 
Unless they grow exceptionally large, scurs aren’t usually a big problem. 
They may cause a lot of bleeding when they break off. In those cases, I just 
spray the area with Blu-Kote to help prevent infection and keep an eye on it.
Exceptionally large scurs can lead to the same problems I talked about in 
relation to horns. (See “The case for no horns on goats.”) Another problem I 
have seen is a scur that grows toward the goat’s eye. A friend with this prob-
lem resolved it by cutting a kid’s “water noodle” (used for swimming) into 
a short piece and gluing it around the scur to hold it out of his eye. In some 
cases you may need to have your veterinarian cut part of it off every so often.
If the damage from a broken scur is extensive, or if the bleeding won’t stop, 
you should cauterize it with a disbudding iron or contact a vet.
Castrating Your Bucks
Responsible goat owners who breed goats eventually have to turn a buckling 
into a wether — that is, castrate him. Fortunately, castration is an easy pro-
cedure and is surprisingly not that hard on a goat. With a minor painkiller, 
a castrated goat is usually back to his old self within a few hours after the 
procedure. The main decisions you have to make about castration are which 
bucks to castrate and which method to use.

152
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
The problem of poor Elmer, 
or why to castrate
In a story widely circulated among goat owners, a woman follows the sad life 
of a buck named Elmer that a family chose not to castrate. They love him as a 
kid, but then he grows up and is not so cute. They sell him to the next unwit-
ting owner, and so on, until a scruffy, stinking Elmer is sold at auction for 
almost nothing and ends up alone in a field, tied to a stake and not properly 
cared for.
The story illustrates one reason you should castrate bucks unless you know 
they will be sold for meat: they outgrow their cuteness and become undesir-
able as pets. Other reasons you should castrate bucks:
 
✓ You need only one buck to breed many does. Your herd is in its best 
shape if you allow only the best of the best to become breeders. Far too 
many people (especially novices) keep bucks that are not from the high-
est quality parents.
 
✓ Bucks require a separate living space to keep kids safe and to control 
breeding.
 
✓ Bucks can be hard to handle. They’re harder to handle and more likely 
than does or wethers to become aggressive — especially during breed-
ing season.
 
✓ Bucks stink, literally. They urinate on themselves during breeding 
season and have scent glands that put out an aroma that many people 
find unpleasant.
On the other hand, although wethers can get big, they are the sweetest of 
all goats, they don’t stink, they make great pets and pack animals, and they 
don’t go into heat and make a ruckus like does or bucks.
Knowing when to castrate
The ideal time to castrate a goat is when he is eight to 12 weeks old, if he is to 
be a pet or a pack goat. If you know that he will be used for meat you can cas-
trate as early as a week old. Castrating too early can predispose the goat to 
developing urinary stones. (Chapter 11 tells you more about urinary stones.) 
Castrating too early may prevent the urethra (the passage from the bladder to 
outside the body) from developing to its full size. Castrating too late can lead 
to inadvertent breeding — bucklings as young as two months old have been 
known to breed does. A larger animal also is harder to restrain, and castrat-
ing late can cause more discomfort or medical problems for the goat.

153
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
Unless your buckling has a future as food or as a herd sire, mark your 
calendar for eight weeks after his birth and be sure to follow through with 
castration.
Choosing a castration method
Castration is an easy procedure. If you are squeamish about it, have a vet-
erinarian or a goatkeeper friend do it for you. If you want to observe before 
trying it yourself, volunteer to hold the goat for the procedure. All of the 
methods require a helper to hold the goat.
About a half hour before castrating the kid, give him one adult aspirin, 0.25 cc 
of Banamine (prescription only), or some white willow bark tincture to help 
prevent pain, and 1 cc tetanus antitoxin to prevent tetanus. The kid will expe-
rience some discomfort after castration but will soon forget about it.
Elastrator Castration (Banding)
Banding is the most common method that goat owners use to castrate their 
goats. It is quick, easy, bloodless, and reliable. Banding refers to applying a 
small, thick rubber band (called an elastrator band) to the top of the testicles 
with a metal tool called an elastrator. Figure 9-12 shows you an elastrator.
 
To prevent bands from breaking down, keep them in the refrigerator until you 
are ready to use them.
 
Figure 9-12: 
An elastra-
tor is the 
most com-
mon tool for 
castrating.
 
To prepare for banding, place a band that has been soaked in alcohol for a 
few minutes on the prongs of the elastrator. No other disinfectant or cleaning 
is needed because the procedure is bloodless.
Follow these steps to castrate using an elastrator:
 
1. Restrain the kid.
 
 Your helper can hold the kid in her lap, facing outward with his back to 
her chest, or she can straddle the goat and lift the kid’s back legs up so 
he is standing on his two front feet.

154
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
2. With the prongs of the elastrator facing the kid, expand the band by 
squeezing the elastrator.
 
3. Place the band over the scrotum and testes close to the body, making 
sure that both testes are under the ring.
 
4. Release the elastrator and pull it from the band, making sure that the 
band is close to the body and that the teats are not trapped in the 
band.
 
 If you believe that the band is not on correctly or if one of the testes is 
not below the ring, cut off the band and repeat the procedure.
The scrotum and testes dry up and drop off in about two weeks. Check them 
regularly after that if they have not fallen off. Check them for infection and 
spray with Blu-Kote or another spray antiseptic, if needed. In a few cases, 
they may be hanging by a small amount of tissue, and you can cut them off 
with a clean scalpel or sharp knife.
Emasculator castration (Burdizzo)
Emasculator castration is also considered bloodless and is done with a some-
what heavy tool called a Burdizzo, or an emasculatome (see Figure 9-13), 
which crushes the spermatic cord. It is not as reliable as other methods 
because you cannot see whether the cord has been effectively crushed.
 
Figure 9-13: 
You use the 
Burdizzo 
to castrate 
a goat by 
crushing the 
spermatic 
cord.
 
 
Never try to crush both cords at the same time. Follow these steps to castrate 
with a Burdizzo:
 
1. Have the helper hold the goat on his lap, with a front and back leg in 
each hand.
 
2. Feel the scrotum for the cord and move the cord to the outer side of 
the scrotum.
 
3. Clamp the Burdizzo over the cord, making sure to avoid the teats. 

155
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
4. Squeeze the Burdizzo to a count of 25, and then release. 
 
 Crushing the cords makes a crunching sound. Squeeze the Burdizzo for 
a second, shorter time.
 
5. Pull slightly on the testicle to ensure that the cord has ruptured.
 
6. Repeat the process on the other spermatic cord. 
The testicles gradually shrink into a small scrotal sac. This method generally 
leaves no wound but can cause small abrasions.
Surgical castration
Surgical castration is the most reliable and least expensive method, but it is 
not for the squeamish, leaves an open wound, and is beyond the scope of this 
book.
Identifying Your Goats: Microchipping 
and Tattooing
If you live in a state that doesn’t require identification, you don’t have to per-
manently identify unregistered goats. If you get a registered goat, it should 
already have a microchip or tattoo, and if you want to register a goat that is 
eligible for one of the registries, you will be required to permanently identify 
it to prove that the goat is who you say it is. So, indirectly, identifying the 
goat can add to its value.
You also may want to permanently identify your goats even if you aren’t 
required to. You never know when you might have to prove that they’re 
yours — if they get lost or stolen, for example.
Choosing a method
I have tattooed and microchipped goats over the years, and find advantages 
and disadvantages to both. (Table 9-1 shows you a comparison of microchip-
ping with tattooing.) 
 
If you plan to register goats, you need to check with the registry you will 
use to find out what method they allow and what tattoo sequence (letters 
and numbers) you need to use. (See Chapter 5 for more information on goat 
registries.)

Basic equipment for tattooing costs less than $100 and only a few dollars a 
year after that. On the other hand, purchasing microchips and a reader has 
an initial cost of more than $400.
Tattooing your goat
Supplies for tattooing include gloves to protect your hands from ink, a pair of 
tattoo tongs, special tattoo ink, and letters and numbers to use in the tongs. 
You can use black ink on light-colored goats, but green shows up better on 
dark-skinned goats.
 
1. Secure the sequence of letters and numbers you will use in the tattoo 
tongs. 
 
 Squeeze them on a piece of paper to ensure that they are in the right 
order. 
 
2. Put on your gloves.
 
3. Clean the inside of the goat’s ear or tail web (the loose, hairless area 
under the tail on either side of the anus) with alcohol, making sure 
that you have the correct ear for the tattoo you are using. 
 
 LaMancha goats’ ears are too small for tattooing, so you need to use the 
tail web.
 
4. When the ear is dry, rub tattoo ink on the inside of the ear or on the 
tail web.

157
 Chapter 9: Handling Routine Care and Important One-Time Tasks
 
5. Hold the ear out and position the tattoo tongs over the inside, being 
careful to avoid the veins to minimize bleeding. 
 
 To tattoo the tail web, position the tongs with the prongs facing the hair-
less side of the tail.
 
6. Puncture the ear or tail web firmly with the tattoo tongs one time, 
then release. 
 
 The goat will try to pull away, so make sure to hold securely.
 
7. Apply more tattoo ink and rub it in with your finger or a toothbrush to 
ensure that it fills the puncture.
 
8. Change the tattoo digits to the sequence you will use for the second 
ear and repeat Steps 1 through 7. 
Microchipping your goat
Microchips come in sterile, individual injectors that look like a large syringe 
and needle. Each is sealed, has a unique number, and includes several stick-
on labels imprinted with the number. The microchips can be read only with 
a special microchip reader. I use the AVID microchips from EZ-ID in Greeley, 
Colorado.
The best place to insert the microchip is in the tail web (the loose, hairless 
area under the tail on either side of the anus). Always use the left side to 
make finding the microchip easier.
You need a cotton ball, some rubbing alcohol, a microchip in its injector, a 
microchip reader, and registration papers and/or another form to record 
the number. (A reader is not required for microchipping, but I recommend 
having one to avoid the small chance of error in recording the number.)
Here are the steps you take to microchip your goat:
 
1. Get your supplies together.
 
 Remove the microchip injector from its container, being careful to keep 
the needle up so the chip doesn’t fall out, and scan it. Confirm that the 
number scanned is identical to the number on the stick-on labels. 
 
2. Secure the goat on a milk stand or have a helper hold the goat on her 
lap.
 
 If you’re using a helper, have her hold the goat with the head to one 
side, the legs secured between her legs, and her arm wrapped around 
the goat’s side holding the tail up. She can hold the legs with the other 
hand for more stability.

158
Part II: Bringing Your Goats Home 
 
3. Clean the insertion area with alcohol.
 
 If you have a goat that may have been microchipped previously, scan 
the area several times to verify that no chip is implanted.
 
4. Insert the needle just under the loose skin for several inches, pressing 
upward at a nearly parallel angle.
 
 Press the plunger until it stops.
 
5. Remove the needle and apply pressure for a few minutes at the injec-
tion site to prevent the microchip from coming out and to stop any 
bleeding.
 
6. Scan to locate the implanted microchip.
 
 Verify the number against the stick-on labels. Place a label on your form 
and registration papers, if applicable, and record the animal’s name.

Breeding

T
o be a good goatkeeper you need to know how to do 
some basic health care. In this part, I give you point-
ers on finding a vet, keeping your goats healthy, and deal-
ing with common ailments. I also discuss breeding, 
pregnancy, and kidding — and caring for those cute kids 
after they arrive.

R
aising goats requires more than just putting them out in a field to eat 
brush and fend for themselves, or putting them in a barn with an auto-
matic waterer and throwing in a bale of hay every so often. In addition to rou-
tine care such as hoof trimming and clipping, you need to be ready for any 
health-care issues that might crop up.
In this chapter I run through points you need to know to take care of your 
goats’ health and be ready for the illnesses, accidents, and surprises your 
goats are sure to throw at you. I talk about how to find and work with a vet-
erinarian and what to include in a first aid kit. I show you how to do simple 
procedures and how to keep health care records. I also run through some 
routine tests you might want your goats to have and tell you about legal 
issues related to giving medications.
Recognizing Signs of Illness
Goats are creatures of habit. You can learn these habits and use them to 
identify illness simply by observing your goats a couple of times each day. 
Besides, it’s a good excuse to spend time with your goats. (See Chapter 2 for 
signs of a healthy goat.)

162
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Some goats always stay with the herd, while others tend to go it alone or 
hang out with just one buddy. When a social goat isolates itself or a loner 
goat suddenly gets into the middle of the herd and starts fighting a lot, you 
have a clue that something might be wrong.
A change in eating habits gives you another clear sign. Goats exhibit only 
minor variations in eating — some are always pigs while others eat more 
slowly or have to fight or be sneaky to get their share. When a goat stops 
eating and drinking, you know it isn’t feeling well. On the other hand, when a 
goat starts eating a lot, it’s pretty obvious that the goat is feeling great!
Here are some other signs that a goat might be sick:
 
✓ Not ruminating: Cud-chewing (called rumination, see Chapter 2) is a part 
of how goats digest their food. Healthy goats ruminate after they eat. 
When a goat stops ruminating, it’s a sign that the digestive system is 
upset.
 
✓ Walking difficulty: A limp indicates a possible injury or a hoof or knee 
problem, while staggering alerts you to a possible neurological problem.
 
✓ Teeth-grinding or head-pressing: Both of these are signs that the goat is 
in pain and you need to investigate further.
 
✓ Changes in breathing: Some health problems can cause fast or labored 
breathing, while others cause the goat to breathe more slowly. Extreme 
heat can also cause labored breathing in a healthy goat.
 
✓ Cough, runny nose, or runny eyes: A healthy goat usually has no cough, 
a moist nose, and dry eyes.
 
✓ Abnormal poop: Goats normally have firm, brownish, pelleted poop. 
Changes in consistency or color may signal a health problem. 
Whenever you find a clue that something might be wrong with a goat, you 
need to examine that goat to see whether it has any other symptoms, take 
its temperature (see Chapter 2), and try to determine whether a problem is 
developing.
Working with a Veterinarian
Unless you are a veterinarian yourself, you need to plan on working with a 
veterinarian to handle goat health care issues that come up. Even if you’re 
competent in some areas because of experience with dogs or other livestock, 
the time will come when you need to call a veterinarian for assistance.

163
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
Finding a vet 
Finding a vet who works with goats and has expertise in goat health may be 
difficult, but you need to find one long before you have a problem. A good 
place to start is with veterinarians who work with horses or other livestock. 
Look in the yellow pages or ask other goat owners to find such vets in your 
area. If you live in an area with a veterinary school, that’s another good 
option. Not only will you get veterinary care for your goats, but you’ll be 
teaching students and possibly influencing another person to be a goat vet.
Where I live, one of the local equine vets has been willing to work with goats 
and is fast becoming a goat expert because the word has spread and many 
goat owners in the area have begun to call him.
 
Don’t wait until your goats are sick before you try to find a veterinarian for 
them. You may not be able to find a vet who will take care of them in an emer-
gency situation and experience a dire outcome.
In order to be most effective, you need someone that you’re comfortable 
with and with whom you can work as a team to provide the best care for your 
animals.
Finding a veterinarian for your goats is usually not as easy as finding one for 
a cat or a dog, particularly if you live in an urban area. Treating goats just 
isn’t as lucrative as treating dogs, cats, or horses. As a result, most veterinar-
ians you find know very little about goats. But think of it as an opportunity to 
teach.
I have had some luck working with a naturopathic, home-care vet, too, so if 
no livestock vets are available in your area, talk to one of these alternative 
practitioners to see whether they would be willing to work with your goats 
and to learn more about them. Doing so benefits not just you and your ani-
mals but other goat owners in the area.
Knowing when to call 
A good time to make that first call to a vet and to start developing a relation-
ship is when you want to have blood drawn for your herd testing. This first 
step makes your goats her patients and is likely to make her more responsive 
when your goats have a problem. Continue to use your veterinarian for rou-
tine care that you can’t perform, or ask her to teach you to do certain proce-
dures when she is out on a farm call.

164
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
When you see a medical problem in your goats that you can’t resolve or you 
believe is serious, don’t hesitate to call your veterinarian. The veterinarian 
may be at another farm, and you may have to wait to get assistance for your 
goat. If the problem turns out not to be so serious, you may be able to get 
advice or a prescription over the phone. The next section tells you about the 
kinds of information you need to communicate a problem to the vet.
Preparing for a vet visit
Before you call a vet to come to your farm or bring a goat in for a non-routine 
care visit — unless it is a serious emergency — take a few steps to make sure 
that your goat gets the most appropriate care.
You’ve already noticed that the goat is not acting like itself. Now you need 
to write down what you have observed. Make notes of the goat’s symptoms, 
how long it has been sick, and the medications or other care you’ve given so 
far. Sometimes remembering everything is hard when you’re under stress, 
and having this kind of information to share helps the vet make a correct 
diagnosis. (See “Keeping Health Records” for tips about recordkeeping.)
If you have time, do the following before your vet visit:
 
✓ Take the goat’s temperature
 
✓ Check its gums for color
 
✓ Listen for heart rate and ruminations
 
✓ Note whether the goat has 
 
• Injuries
 
• Crusty eyes
 
• Breathing problems or coughing
 
• Diarrhea
 
✓ Check for dehydration by pinching the skin on the neck in front of the 
shoulder, using your thumb and forefinger. Note whether the skin snaps 
back to its normal position quickly or stays in a tent before it slowly 
goes back to normal. A slow return to normal indicates that the goat is 
dehydrated.
Record all of your observations for the vet’s reference. Also be ready to 
share the goat’s history of prior illness, vaccinations, and other health care 
information.

165
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
 
If the vet will be making a farm call, ask whether you can do anything before 
he arrives. For example, he might want a urine or fecal sample. You also need 
to catch the goat and put him in a confined, lighted area while waiting for the 
vet to arrive.
Working with a non-goat veterinarian
Most goat owners find themselves using a veterinarian who has little or no 
experience with goats. Most of these vets are willing to admit to this lack of 
knowledge and work with the owner to learn together.
You can assist in this learning process by
 
✓ Sharing goat health care information that you get from goat conferences, 
magazine subscriptions, and other breeders.
 
✓ Suggesting that the vet buy one of the goat health books on the market, 
or if you can afford it, buying one as a gift.
 
✓ Giving the vet a membership to the American Association of Small 
Ruminant Practitioners (www.aasrp.org), which has a regular newslet-
ter that always contains current health information.
 
✓ Getting a group of goat owners together to split the cost of a veterinar-
ian’s visit. Some people do this with blood-drawing for testing, for 
example.
 
Don’t be afraid to share your observations and suggestions with your vet, 
regardless of her area of specialization. Goat health care is changing all the 
time as new information becomes available. The only way we can all learn is to 
share.
Building a First Aid Kit
If you have only a couple of goats, you probably can afford the occasional 
veterinary visit. But as your herd grows, you’re likely to find that you want to 
save money and hassle by treating some of their minor ailments or handling 
some of the health care yourself. But even if you don’t want to take over 
some of this care, you still need to be prepared for those times when a vet 
isn’t available or the problem is minor.

166

The Straight Poop: Fecal Analysis
The best way to find out whether your goats have parasites is through fecal 
analysis, which involves collecting a sample of goat berries, mixing them 
with a solution and viewing the resulting sample under a microscope to see 
whether they contain too many parasite eggs.
Unfortunately, most goat owners rarely have their goat feces analyzed. For 
years, the common practice was to regularly deworm goats, sometimes 
as often as every month, and to rotate the dewormers used to treat the 
parasites. This led to trouble — the parasites became resistant to available 
dewormers in some areas of the United States. Rather than just blindly treat 
for parasites, the better solution is to analyze the feces to determine whether 
a problem really exists.
 
Unless you have a problem with parasites, twice-a-year testing is adequate. 
One of the most important times to test your does is right after they kid. The 
stress of the birth can make them more susceptible to parasite problems. If 
you cannot test your does at this time, deworm them as a preventive measure. 
(See Chapter 12 to find out how to deworm a goat.)

168
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
I also recommend randomly testing some of the kids during their first six 
months. They’re more likely to have high numbers of parasites during this 
period because their immune systems are not yet fully developed.
All you have to do for fecal testing is collect a few goat berries, put them in 
plastic bags, and take or ship them to a veterinarian or veterinary lab for 
analysis. Ask your vet what he prefers and what paperwork is required. Some 
veterinary labs may require a referring veterinarian, but others allow you to 
print out the paperwork from their Web site and submit your own samples. 
In my early years of raising goats, I sent samples of feces from each small 
group of goats that lived in different areas of my farm — for example, the 
bucks, the does, and the kids. This group testing method is not as precise as 
individual testing but can give you an idea whether trouble is brewing, and 
it’s much less expensive if you have a large herd. Eventually I bought a micro-
scope and began doing my own fecal testing. I now test when I see a problem 
with anemia, diarrhea, or even a rough coat, or randomly on different goats 
in different areas of the farm.
 
To do your own fecal tests, you need a microscope that has at least 40X power 
(you can get one for less than $100 from American Science & Surplus, (www.
sciplus.com) and a few other supplies. Fias Co Farm (www.fiascofarm.
com) has detailed, step-by-step instructions for testing, and it has photos of 
the different parasite eggs.
After you have determined what kind(s) of parasites are afflicting your goats, 
you need to deworm them. Table 10-1 lists the dewormers that are effective 
against specific parasites. Whenever you deworm, always give the dewormer 
orally at twice the cattle dose (by weight), except Moxidectin, which is more 
effective given by injection. Don’t rotate dewormers frequently; use only 
one dewormer until it no longer works in your herd and then switch to a 
dewormer in another chemical family. Chapter 12 tells you how to deworm 
a goat.

Another kind of testing related to parasites is called the Drenchrite test, 
which can determine which dewormers will be effective. This test is con-
ducted only at the University of Georgia Parasitology lab, and it’s expensive. 
This test came about in response to the serious problem with parasites and 
resistance to dewormers that has evolved in the southern United States. If 
you have a problem getting control of parasites in your goats or dewormers 
aren’t working, you can get information about this test at www.scsrcp.com.
Giving Injections
You can have a vet visit or take your goats to a clinic to receive vaccinations 
or other injections, and many goat owners do this. But others prefer to save 
the money and do it themselves. Being a hands-on type of person, I learned 
to give my goats injections in the first year of owning them.
Giving injections is easy after you get over any fear you might have. I recom-
mend you have an experienced person, such as a vet or another goat owner, 
demonstrate the technique before you try it. You can also practice by inject-
ing into an orange — just remember to dispose of your practice needles and 
syringes.
 
Anaphylaxis is a severe, sudden allergic reaction. The faster it occurs, the 
more severe it is. If a goat unexpectedly collapses or goes into shock after an 
injection, administer epinephrine immediately. The dose is 0.5-1.0 cc per 100 
pounds.
 
You can get needles and syringes at a feed store, veterinary office, or livestock 
supply catalog. I usually use tuberculin syringes for kids and 20-gauge needles 
for adults. Ask your vet whether you need a different size needle.
The two most common types of injections are subcutaneous (SQ), which is 
just under the skin, and intramuscular (IM), which goes into the muscle. Read 
the instructions that come with the medication you’re using to determine 
what type of injection to give. Most injections that can be given IM also can be 
given SQ; consult with your veterinarian regarding which injections you need 
to give IM. I prefer to give subcutaneous injections because then I don’t have 
to worry about hitting a blood vessel or vein.
When you’re ready to give injections yourself, gather your supplies and bring 
your goat into an area away from the other goats. Have someone hold the 
goat and find the site where you will give the injection (see Figure 10-1). The 
best places to give injections are the sides of the neck and “armpit” area just 
behind the front leg. Never use the rear leg because you can hit a nerve and 
make the goat lame.

Injection 
sites.
 
Gather your supplies:
 
✓ Medication
 
✓ Disposable needle and syringe
 
✓ Alcohol and cotton balls or other wipes
 
✓ Container for sharps (used needles), which you can purchase at a drug 
store
Before giving the injection, wipe the top of the medicine vial with alcohol to 
ensure that it’s sterile. Then insert the needle into the bottle and withdraw 
the required dose of medication. Withdraw the needle and tap the syringe 
and push the injector slightly to push out any bubbles. 
To give an SQ injection:
 
1. Lift the skin into a tent.
 
2. Insert the needle under the skin into the tent, toward the body.
 
 Make sure that the needle isn’t in the skin or muscle, or through the 
other side of the tent.

171
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
 
3. Inject the medication and remove the needle.
 
4. Discard the needle and syringe into your sharps container.
To give an IM injection:
 
1. Insert the needle into the muscle, being careful not to hit bone.
 
2. Withdraw the plunger slightly to make sure that you have not hit a 
vein or vessel. 
 
 If you see blood in the syringe, pull out the needle and start over.
 
3. Depress the plunger slowly, and then withdraw the needle.
 
4. Rub the injection area gently but firmly to distribute the medication.
 
5. Discard the needle and syringe into your sharps container.
 
Never use the same needle or syringe for different medications or on different 
goats. Mixing medications can make them less effective or cause an unex-
pected chemical reaction; sharing needles can spread diseases from one goat 
to another.
Considering Vaccinations
Vaccines cause the immune system to produce antibodies to a specific dis-
ease. You’re probably familiar with the flu vaccine and other vaccines that 
children routinely receive. Some are more effective than others and some, 
such as the soremouth vaccine, actually can give a milder form of the dis-
ease. It depends on the type of vaccine and whether it contains a live form of 
the disease it was created to prevent. 
In this section, I give you insight into whether to vaccinate. I tell you about 
vaccines commonly given to goats and offer pointers for giving a vaccination.
Deciding whether to vaccinate
Most veterinarians recommend that, at a minimum, you vaccinate goats for 
clostridium perfringens types C and D and tetanus (CDT). This vaccine pre-
vents tetanus and enterotoxemia that’s caused by two different bacteria. Yet 
many breeders don’t vaccinate their goats with this or any other vaccine, for 
different reasons. 

172
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Vaccinating for enterotoxemia or another disease doesn’t always prevent the 
disease. But in some cases, if a vaccinated goat does get the disease, it will be 
shorter and less severe, and the goat is less likely to die. And the cost of vac-
cinating is minor, in comparison to treating the disease or paying to replace a 
dead goat.
Looking into common vaccinations
A number of vaccines are used to prevent disease in goats (see Table 10-2). 
Most of them are approved for use in sheep but not goats. That doesn’t mean 
that they aren’t effective or can’t be used in goats but that they haven’t been 
formally tested on goats.
Most goat owners with small herds usually don’t need any vaccines other 
than CDT and tetanus. In areas where rabies is rampant, some veterinarians 
recommend that you vaccinate your goats for rabies, even though it isn’t 
approved for goats. I suggest that you work with a veterinarian to determine 
what is right for your circumstances.

 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
Giving a vaccination
All goat vaccines are formulated to be and so must be given as injections. 
Follow these guidelines when giving a vaccination:
 
✓ To minimize the chance of an adverse reaction, vaccinate goats only 
when they are in good health.
 
✓ Do not use expired or cloudy vaccines.
 
✓ Use a 20-gauge, 1-inch or 3⁄4-inch needle on an adult, or a 1⁄2-inch needle 
on a kid.
 
✓ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dosage.
 
✓ Use a new, sterile needle and syringe on each goat.
 
✓ Do not mix vaccines.
 
✓ For the best effect, do not delay booster shots.
 
✓ Keep a record of vaccinations given.
Keeping Health Records
Documenting the care and treatments that you or a veterinarian provide is 
an important part of keeping your goats healthy. The form of the record is 
less important than the information that you record. You can even write on a 
piece of notebook paper if that works for you.
Documenting important information
I use two kinds of documents to help me record all the necessary information 
for routine and critical goat health care: a health record form and a calendar. 
I have created my own health record form and I use a wall calendar to supple-
ment it. I record current detailed information on the health record form and 
current general information (such as the fact that a doe kidded) and future 
scheduling (for example, the next date for hoof trimming) on the calendar.
 Some information to include on a health care record is:
 
✓ Goat’s name
 
✓ Date of birth or age
 
✓ Identification number

174
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ Condition being treated
 
✓ Treatment given (hoof trim, injection, and so on)
 
• Date of treatment
 
• Details or comments
 
✓ Kidding information
 
• Breeding date or expected due date
 
• Sire
 
• Kidding date
 
• Number and sex of kids
 
• Outcome/comments
You can make your own health care form using this information or other 
things you consider important. You can also talk to other goat owners to find 
out what they use or get a form online and use it as-is or modify it to your 
needs.
 
Keep your goats’ health record in a place where you can easily refer to it. I 
keep mine in a notebook in the barn. I keep the calendar on the wall in the 
house so I can keep an eye on expected kidding dates and scheduled treat-
ment and care.
Unless you routinely get a goat out for milking or another purpose, you may 
not think about hoof-trimming until the goat’s hooves are overgrown, or 
giving booster shots within the recommended time frame. The combination 
of a health record form and calendar tell you what you have done and when 
you next need to do it.
Keeping track of recurrent problems
I had a really sweet goat named Katharine who had a problem kidding her 
first time — the buck kid got stuck and was dead when I got it out, and the 
doeling died shortly after birth. The next year she had itty-bitty twin girls 
that survived. The year after that she cost me some money when another 
kid got stuck and had to be removed after it died. I sold Katharine that year 
because when I checked my old records I realized that she had a serious 
problem. It wasn’t just an aberrant condition that first year.
If you’re raising goats to make money, knowing which ones are repeatedly 
getting pneumonia or parasites is critical to determining which to keep and 
which to sell. If you aren’t, the information can still tell you that you might 
need to change the way you manage that particular animal.

175
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
I don’t know about you, but I can’t always rely on my memory to know which 
goats get sick every few years. After they improve and do well for a while I 
forget that they were even sick. Documenting recurrent problems is one of 
the most valuable reasons to keep accurate health records on your goats.
Providing information for the vet
If you have a goat with an illness that seems minor, you will probably initially 
treat it by yourself or in consultation with a veterinarian. Using a health care 
record to document everything you do makes for a smoother transition if the 
goat’s condition worsens and you have to call a vet for help.
Show your records to the vet so he knows what you have done and what may 
not be working. These records may even save you some time and money.
Tracking trends
Do you know if a certain doe always has her kids at night? Does your herd 
always have a higher rate of coccidia during a certain month? Do does in a 
specific family line always have high numbers of multiple kids? These are just 
some of the trends that you can discover by keeping health records over a 
number of years.
Some of these trends might just be interesting, but others help you keep your 
goats healthier. For instance, you might decide to give a preventive anticoc-
cidial (see Chapter 11) during the month in which more kids got it. Or you 
may want to evaluate and improve your feeding program for does that usu-
ally have high numbers of kids.
Keeping goat health care records might take a little more time, but they pay 
off in the long run. They help you schedule care, assist your veterinarian, and 
provide a wealth of information on individual goats and the whole herd.
Testing to Avoid Problems
Even if you got your goats from a reputable breeder, you want to be sure they 
don’t have a disease unknown to that breeder. This can happen, for example, 
when the test for a disease shows a false negative or cannot be detected until 
a kid is older. The best way to make sure they don’t actually have a disease is 
to routinely test them, usually annually.
If you’re bringing home your first goats, you need to consider routine testing 
for common diseases. If you’re adding to your herd, the first 30 days when 

176
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
they are in quarantine is the perfect time to have them tested to make sure they 
aren’t carrying a hidden disease. (See Chapter 5 for more about quarantining.)
Unless you have a closed herd (your goats never leave and no new goats 
come in), you need to consider testing or re-testing at least annually. Doing 
so not only gives you peace of mind, but if you sell goats, test results give 
buyers written proof that the goats are healthy. The upcoming sections tell 
you about the most common diseases and the kinds of testing you might do 
to detect them.
Knowing what to test for
You can test for most of the more serious contagious diseases with a simple 
blood draw. These tests usually are part of annual care. But you can also do 
them when you have a goat that is showing symptoms of one of these dis-
eases and you and your vet haven’t been able to determine the cause.
Work with your veterinarian to determine which diseases to test for in your 
goats. Some tests are expensive and not 100 percent accurate. Chapter 12 
tells you more about common diseases.
The diseases that goat owners most frequently test for include
 
✓ Three different tests (listed in order of reliability) are used to detect 
antibody to the caprine arthritic encephalitis virus (CAEV) — the AGID, 
the ELISA, and the PCR. These blood tests don’t detect the disease, but a 
goat that has antibodies to CAEV is considered to be infected.
 
✓ The test for caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) requires lab analysis of pus 
that has been aspirated from an active abscess. The CLA vaccine can 
cause false positive results.
 
✓ Several tests for Johne’s disease are available — some use blood and 
others use feces. Testing is expensive and not always accurate. Because 
the disease is believed to be spreading in goats because of goat owners 
feeding cow colostrum to kids, testing is becoming more common, par-
ticularly when the owner has goats that die after a long, wasting disease.
 
✓ Brucellosis testing is most often done on blood, although a newer test 
has been developed using goat milk. 
 
✓ The test for tuberculosis is a skin test for antibodies.
How to draw blood for a test
A veterinarian will come out to your farm to do most kinds of tests on your 
goats. But you can save money by drawing blood from your goats and send-

177
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
ing the samples directly to a lab. Ask your veterinarian or another breeder 
who is comfortable with drawing blood to show you how they do it.
Your veterinarian or another breeder can also help you find out where to 
send samples from your area and how to ship. To get an idea of shipping 
requirements, see the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory 
(WADDL) information at www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts_waddl/.
To draw blood, you need a helper to hold the goat and the following supplies:
 
✓ Alcohol prep wipes
 
✓ 3 ml syringes with 3⁄4-inch 20-gauge needles, one for each goat
 
✓ Vacutainer tubes (from a veterinary supply store or vet) 
 
 The color of the container top varies according to the type of test to be 
done. Make sure you have the correct tubes.
 
✓ Clippers, if you need to shave the area
 
✓ Paper, pen, and permanent marker
Here’s how to draw blood for testing:
 
1. Make a list of all goats to be tested, numbering each one.
 
2. Label the tube with the name of the goat, the date, and your name or 
farm name.
 
3. Have the helper back the goat into a corner and hold the goat’s nose 
with one hand and around the chest with the other.
 
4. Find the jugular vein by pressing on the left side of the goat’s throat 
near the bottom of the neck. (See Figure 10-2.)
 
 The vein pops up slightly when you press on it. If you need to, shave the 
area to more easily locate the vein.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Feeling the 
vein and 
inserting the 
needle.
 

178
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
5. Remove the needle cap and insert the needle upward into the skin 
and vein at an angle nearly parallel to the vein.
 
 Be careful not to the push the needle through the vein.
 
6. Gently pull back on the plunger.
 
 If blood does not enter the syringe, remove the need and start over.
 
7. If you see blood in the syringe, continue pulling the plunger until you 
have 3 cc.
 
8. Remove the needle, replace the cap, and put pressure on the goat’s 
neck for 30 seconds.
 
9. Remove the needle cap, insert the needle into the goat’s labeled tube 
and inject the blood.
When you have finished drawing blood from your goats, refrigerate the sam-
ples or prepare them for delivery to the lab or veterinary office.
Knowing the Law Regarding Drugs 
in Food Animals
Giving medications to goats is not the same as giving them to dogs or cats. 
By law, goats are considered food animals, even if you keep them as pets. So 
if you are going to be administering any drugs to your goats, you need to be 
aware of the law.
The law on prescribing medications for food animals requires that 
 
✓ You use prescription drugs for your goats only on a veterinarian’s order. 
 
✓ The veterinarian who prescribes the drugs has a veterinarian/client rela-
tionship with you prior to prescribing.
 
✓ Drugs prescribed for your goats are properly labeled.
 
✓ The veterinarians keep appropriate records regarding the drugs pre-
scribed.
Certain drugs are prohibited in food animals, and others that are used in 
goats are not approved by the FDA for use in goats. (Goats are considered 
a “minor species,” and so very few drugs have been tested on them.) This 
doesn’t mean that a veterinarian can’t prescribe them. When the vet pre-
scribes these drugs, it is called extralabel use, and the vet has some responsi-
bility for ensuring that they don’t leave residues in food.

179
 Chapter 10: Outlining Basic Health Care Requirements
Each goat owner is responsible for making sure that the meat and milk from 
her animals don’t contain any drug residues. This responsibility, under Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) policy, applies to anyone in “the production 
and marketing chain.”
Each medication has a specified withdrawal time for meat and for milk. This 
is the period of time during which the milk or meat from the animal still con-
tains drug residue. You need to be aware of the withdrawal times of all drugs 
you give your animals, including pain medications and dewormers. 
Ask your veterinarian about the withdrawal times for any medications pre-
scribed or that you are unsure of, and make sure not to drink or sell the milk, 
or sell an animal that might be eaten within the withdrawal time period.

Addressing Common Health 
Problems and Ailments
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know common parasites
▶ Learning about parasite management techniques
▶ Recognizing potential health problems
▶ Preventing nutritional deficiencies
E
ven healthy goat herds can develop problems from time to time. Being 
prepared and knowing what to look for helps you avoid serious prob-
lems. And even when you do all the right things and problems occur, being 
aware of the steps you need to take can help you avoid trouble in the future.
In this chapter I introduce you to some of the more likely health problems 
and ailments that may crop up in your herd and what you do to resolve them.
Managing the Creepy-Crawlies
Regardless of how well you care for your goats, they will get parasites — 
organisms that live and feed on another organism. All mammals have para-
sites, which isn’t completely bad, because their presence stimulates the 
animals’ immune systems and keeps them healthy. But when a goat gets 
overwhelmed by parasites, trouble starts.
Luckily for goat owners, many of these little critters are host-specific, which 
means that goats can get them but people can’t. By the same token, goats 
can’t get most of our parasites, either. Exceptions are ticks, fleas, and some 
mites.
Parasites are of two types: External parasites live on the outside the body, 
and internal parasites live inside the body, usually in the digestive system.

182
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Controlling external parasites
External parasites are often just an annoyance, but they can lead to bacterial 
infections of the skin. You can prevent such infections by routine grooming, 
avoiding indoor overcrowding of your goats, and identifying and treating 
infestations early.
Lice
Goats can get two kinds of lice: sucking lice and biting lice. Biting lice eat 
dead skin cells on the goats and make them itch. Sucking lice are more 
serious — they not only cause itching, but they suck the goats’ blood, which 
can lead to anemia.
Lice tend to take up residence on a goat in winter months. You can usually 
tell that a goat has lice because it shows signs of itching. Its coat may begin 
to look rough, and the goat will rub on fences (more than usual), have dan-
druff, lose patches of hair, and chew on itself.
You can see the lice or their grayish eggs (called nits) by inspecting the top of 
the goat’s back with a magnifying glass. You need a microscope to determine 
whether you’re dealing with sucking or biting lice. Sucking lice have large 
heads, and biting lice have small heads. They are very creepy-looking and 
have small claws. You can see the differences between sucking and biting lice 
in Figure 11-1.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The head 
of a biting 
louse (left) 
is smaller 
than that of 
a sucking 
louse (right).
 
 
You can often control lice just by regularly brushing your goats or clipping 
them when the weather is warmer. (See Chapter 10 for more on brushing and 
clipping.) If the goats aren’t severely infested — experiencing intense itching 
and hair loss — the lice will leave on their own, even without grooming, when 
the weather is warm and goats spend more time in the sun.

183
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
For more severe infestations, treat goats twice over a two-week period, 
using an insecticide dust such as Co-Ral or a pour-on such as UltraBoss. The 
labeled use is 1.5 ml per 50 pounds poured along the back and down the face. 
Do not use this pour-on on a goat more than every two weeks and do not use 
the dust on lactating dairy goats.
Mites
Like lice, mites infest goats mainly during colder months. They come in two 
types: burrowing and non-burrowing. The non-burrowing mites usually start 
in hairy areas of the body, such as the tail, and then work their way along the 
body. They attach to the skin and puncture it, releasing body fluid. You may 
see crusty patches and hair loss on a goat under attack from mites.
Some mites live in goats’ ears. These ear mites more commonly cause prob-
lems in LaManchas because their small external ears are not as protective as 
the longer ears. Use mineral oil in the ears to smother mites there.
Another type of mites is fond of the scrotum and the area between the 
legs and belly. I have had success treating these by smothering them with 
Vaseline.
Burrowing mites are related to the mite that causes scabies in humans. They 
start in areas that are hairless or have little hair, such as the goat’s face or 
ears. They cause itching and bare burrows in the skin and eventually may 
lead to thickened skin and extensive hair loss.
You can get rid of both burrowing and non-burrowing mites with subcutane-
ous (under the skin) injections of ivermectin. For best results, treat the whole 
herd and do a second treatment to ensure that all eggs that hatch after the 
initial treatment are dead. Continue to check the goats and contact a veteri-
narian for severe cases or where treatment is not effective.
Fleas and keds
Fleas and keds (also called louse flies) are wingless, jumping bugs that can 
infest goats, usually in the spring or summer. All of them are bloodsuckers, 
but they usually are more of a pest than a serious health problem. Goats can 
get fleas from dogs and cats, and they can get keds from sheep.
If your goats have fleas or keds, you probably notice them rubbing, scratch-
ing, and chewing, and you will be able to see the bugs upon inspection. You 
can treat the goat with one of the products that work on lice, such as Co-Ral 
dust or UltraBoss Pour-on.

184
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Ticks
If your goats are pastured in or near woods, they’re a target for ticks. Ticks 
can be more than just pests because they can spread Lyme disease, Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever, and other diseases that affect goats and humans. 
Ticks burrow into the goats’ skin, so make sure to remove them as soon as 
you see them. A tick that has attached to a goat looks like a skin tag and can 
be as big as a pencil eraser.
 
To remove a tick, grasp it with tweezers as close as possible to the head or 
mouth and pull gently until it lets go. Drop the tick into a jar of alcohol to kill 
and preserve it in case you want to have it examined later for disease. To pre-
vent future ticks, you can treat the goat with a pour-on or spray that contains 
the natural insecticide permethrin, such as Ectiban EC.
Minimizing internal parasites
Internal parasites are one of the most common problems of goats, especially 
in warm, wet weather and climates. They mainly affect the goats’ digestive 
systems, although a few migrate to other parts of the body. All mammals nor-
mally have a low level of certain internal parasites — only when the parasites 
get out of control do they cause problems.
Coccidiosis
Coccidia are parasitic protozoa that tend to be a problem in kids or older, 
weakened goats. These single-celled organisms are always in the goat’s envi-
ronment and are normally carried by all goats. Only when they reproduce 
and overwhelm a goat that isn’t resistant to them do they become a problem. 
An overgrowth of coccidia in a goat’s digestive tract is called coccidiosis.
Kids under the age of six months are at highest risk of coccidiosis because 
their immune systems aren’t yet developed enough to ward off the disease and 
because their mothers are likely to be shedding a high number of eggs after 
kidding. These eggs attack the intestinal lining, causing pain and blood loss. 
The main sign of coccidiosis is diarrhea (called scours in reference to livestock) 
although in some cases an affected goat becomes constipated and dies.
 
When an adult goat suddenly dies for no apparent reason, have it checked by 
a veterinarian for coccidiosis and treat the whole herd if coccidiosis is found.
Some goats die very quickly from coccidiosis; a smaller number of kids have 
no signs other than failure to thrive. They don’t gain weight and are small 
and thin but don’t seem sick otherwise. If you are bottle-feeding kids, you 
can give Deccox, a drug that is approved in goats for preventing coccidiosis. 
Save-a-Kid milk replacer contains Deccox, or you can add powdered Deccox 
to milk. Hoegger Goat Supply sells Di-Methox 40%, which they recommend 
adding to kids’ milk to prevent coccidiosis.

185
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
If you don’t bottle-feed and don’t want to give your goats medication unless 
they’re sick, you can help prevent coccidiosis by following the recommenda-
tions in the upcoming section “Helping keep parasite problems at bay” and 
by dealing with diarrhea as soon as you notice it. (For more on diarrhea, see 
the upcoming section “Scours.”)
 
Diarrhea can be a serious problem in kids, dehydrating them fast. If you have 
a kid that has diarrhea for more than a day, loss of appetite, and weakness, 
contact a veterinarian and get a fecal analysis to determine the cause. Do not 
use Corid (amprolium) to treat coccidiosis because it can cause polioencepha-
lomalacia (thiamine deficiency) in goats. (See more on polioencephalomalacia 
in the upcoming section “Feed-Related Problems.”)
Common worms
The most common worms that affect goats are those that live in the goat’s 
stomach and small intestine. The worm that causes the biggest problem, 
particularly in rainy, warm areas such as the southern United States, is 
Haemonchus contortus, or the barber pole worm. It is red and white striped, 
and it sucks the goats’ blood and reproduces rapidly.
Anemia is the most common symptom produced by the barber pole worm. 
(See upcoming “FAMACHA: It’s in the eyes” section for information about 
monitoring for barber pole worm.) You can also identify it by the eggs in a 
fecal analysis.
Barber pole worm can cause bottle jaw, a swelling below the lower jaw. The 
worm is resistant to many wormers because they were overused trying to 
combat it over the years. Effective treatment depends on which dewormer 
works in your area. (See upcoming “Deworming” section.)
Other worms that may take up residence in your goats include the following:
 
✓ Brown stomach worm and bankrupt worm: More common in fall and 
winter, these stomach worms can cause diarrhea, rough coat, and thin-
ness and inability to gain weight. Treatment of these worms depends on 
dewormer resistance. (See upcoming “Deworming” section.)
 
✓ Tapeworms: Tapeworms are easy to identify without a microscope 
because they drop off white sections about the size of a grain of rice 
in the feces. They cause young goats to get pot-bellied and to develop 
poorly because the parasites absorb their food. They can also cause 
diarrhea. A cold freeze can stop the tapeworm cycle in a pasture, but 
otherwise they can survive in the ground for a year. Treat tapeworms 
with Valbazen. (Valbazen can cause birth defects if you give it to does in 
the first 30 days of pregnancy.)
 
✓ Meningeal worm: The meningeal worm is spread by deer, which is 
why you should try to keep deer away from goats. This worm is more 
common in the fall and winter and needs wet weather. Part of its repro-
ductive cycle occurs in snails and slugs.

186
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
 Rather than causing diarrhea, the meningeal worm causes neurologi-
cal problems in goats, including partial paralysis, circling, blindness, 
and difficulty walking. If your goat develops these symptoms, contact 
a veterinarian to determine whether it is meningeal worm and to treat 
it. Treatment may not be effective and requires not only high doses of 
dewormers but steroids.
 
✓ Liver fluke: True to its name, this fluke invades the liver, where it 
causes internal bleeding and consequent anemia. These parasites use 
a certain type of snail in their reproductive cycle and affect goats in 
the winter and spring. In severe cases, the goat will lose its appetite, 
lie down and not get up, and ultimately die. Less severe cases can 
cause thinness, rough coat, rapid heart rate, and bottle jaw. The only 
dewormer that is effective against all stages of liver fluke is Chlorsulan. 
Valbazen can be used to treat mature liver flukes.
 
✓ Lungworms: Lungworms are cool-weather parasites. Some use snails 
and slugs in their reproduction, and others are coughed up by infected 
goats or are released in the feces and then mature. Hot weather and 
freezes kill them.
 
 Lungworms can cause painful breathing, chronic cough, failure to gain 
weight, and death. When you have a goat with a chronic cough and no 
fever or other signs of pneumonia, consider lungworms. They can be 
definitively diagnosed only with a Baermann test, a special fecal exam 
performed by a veterinary lab.
Testing for parasites
In order to properly use dewormers in your goats, you first have to deter-
mine whether your goats have a problem with internal parasites and, if so, 
what parasites they have, especially if the goats are not showing any signs 
of illness. Doing a routine fecal analysis before a goat shows signs helps you 
identify and prevent potential problems before they occur. (See Chapter 10 
for more on fecal analysis.)
 
Giving your goats dewormers routinely and randomly makes parasites resis-
tant to these products, rendering them ineffective.
FAMACHA: It’s in the eyes
FAMACHA is a method for evaluating whether a goat is becoming anemic 
from a parasite overload, most often the barber pole worm. FAMACHA, which 
requires training, involves looking at a goat’s lower eyelid and comparing it 
to a laminated card with five different colors. The lighter the color, the more 
anemic the goat is.
FAMACHA enables you to identify and treat only those goats that have a seri-
ous parasite problem, rather than treating healthy goats. You can get more 
information on this method by contacting the Southern Consortium for Small 
Ruminant Parasite Control (SCSRPC) at www.scsrpc.org.

187
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
Deworming
Sooner or later your goats will develop a problem with parasites, or you’ll 
want to preventively deworm a doe after kidding or a new addition to the 
herd while it’s still in quarantine. You figure out the right dose by first weigh-
ing your goat. Then read the label, which tells you the cattle dose by weight. 
Double the cattle dose for all dewormers except Levamisole (Tramisol), 
which is one and half times the cattle dose.
If possible, amp up the dewormer’s effectiveness by withholding feed for 
12 hours before giving the dewormer. Give the dewormer orally, except for 
moxidectin, by putting it over the tongue into the back of the throat with a 
drench gun or the tip of the deworming applicator. Give moxidectin by sub-
cutaneous injection.
 
Do not use albendazole if the goat has been bred or during the first 30 days of 
pregnancy; it can cause birth defects.
Helping keep parasite problems at bay
Prevent parasite problems by taking a few simple steps:
 
✓ Avoid having too many goats in too small an area.
 
✓ Don’t allow goats to overgraze.
 
✓ Regularly clean the goats’ living quarters of dirty bedding.
 
✓ Don’t feed your goats on the ground.
 
✓ Keep deer, which can be carriers, away from goats.
 
✓ Introduce ducks or geese, which eat the snails and slugs that spread cer-
tain parasites.
 
✓ Deworm goats in quarantine before introducing them to your herd.
 
✓ Perform routine fecal analysis. (See Chapter 10.)
Acquainting Yourself with Goat 
Viruses and Infections
Viruses and infections are common in goats. Goats are more prone to these 
diseases when they are under stress, during weather extremes or changes, 
and when they are overcrowded.

188
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
You can avoid some of these conditions by ensuring that goats are tested 
and found to be negative for the condition before you bring them into your 
herd. Others can be treated with antibiotics when you catch them early 
enough. (See Chapter 10 to find out about testing and about identifying 
illness in your goats.)
Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus 
(CAEV)
Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) is a member of the same virus 
family as HIV. It was named for two of the most common forms of the 
disease — arthritis (inflammation of the joints), which usually is in the form of 
swollen knees, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), which shows up 
as neurological problems. CAEV also can cause chronic mastitis, pneumonia, 
and weight loss. In most cases, goats have no symptoms at all but are still 
carriers.
Researchers don’t completely understand how CAEV is transmitted, but it 
is most commonly spread through body fluids — in the case of goats, colos-
trum, milk, and blood. Goats that live with an infected goat can also get it, 
and in some cases CAEV is believed to be passed in utero. CAEV is currently 
incurable. CAEV is diagnosed by a blood test that indicates whether a goat 
has antibodies to the virus. 
 
To prevent CAEV in your herd, know who you are getting your goats from and 
insist that any new goats or their parents have tested negative for the virus. 
Have your goats tested the first year after you get them, and if they ever leave 
your farm, or new goats or sheep come in, continue to test them annually. 
Breed them only to CAEV-negative bucks.
 
If you have a goat with CAEV, you must keep it isolated from other goats 
that are CAEV-negative, or plan to have all of your goats eventually become 
infected. If possible, do not breed an infected goat to an uninfected buck. (The 
risk of a negative buck becoming infected by a positive doe is unlikely, but 
some risk exists.)
If you have a CAEV-positive doe that kids, take these CAEV prevention steps 
to decrease the kids’ risk of contracting the virus:
 
1.  As soon as the kid is born, put it in a separate box and remove it from 
its mother.
 
2. Wash the kid with mild soapy water, rinse, and dry it.
 
 Dry the kid with a blow dryer or towel, making sure it doesn’t get 
chilled.

189
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
 
3. Put the kid in an area separate from its mother or other goats that are 
CAEV-positive.
 
 You can put multiple kids in the same area as long as all of them are 
kept from CAEV-positive goats.
 
4. Feed the kid within the first half-hour, or as soon as possible.
 
 If you have colostrum that has been heat-treated, or is from a doe that is 
known to be CAEV-negative, or colostrum from a cow known to be nega-
tive for Johne’s disease, give the kid an ounce or two at a temperature of 
about 104° Fahrenheit in a bottle. If you do not have safe colostrum, milk 
some out of the mother, heat-treat it and give to the kid as soon as pos-
sible.
 
 To heat-treat colostrum, heat it to between 135° and 140° Fahrenheit in 
a double boiler and keep at that temperature for one hour. Make sure 
that the temperature does not go higher than 140° Fahrenheit or the 
colostrum will thicken too much. A good method is to pour the heated 
colostrum into a hot metal thermos, put the thermos into a water bath 
and monitor the temperature of the water.
 
 After the first feeding, feed the kids only pasteurized whole goat or cow 
milk, kid or sheep milk replacer, or milk from a doe that is known to be 
CAEV-negative. Note that the kids may be at risk for Johne’s disease 
drinking even pasteurized cow milk. (Check out the section “Johne’s 
Disease” to find out more.)
 
5. Test the kids for CAEV beginning at six months of age and separate 
any that test positive from the CAEV-negative goats.
Abscesses
An abscess is an inflamed collection of pus caused by bacteria. Abscesses 
often appear as lumps in goats’ head and neck region, but they show up in 
other areas, too.
Infectious abscess
Infectious abscesses are usually caused by a foreign object, such as a splinter 
or a thorn, lodging under a goat’s skin and becoming infected. Injections can 
also cause abscesses. Sometimes you see a lump that enlarges, or you might 
just notice the large lump all of a sudden.
Bacteria such as staph and strep populate the abscess as the body mounts a 
defense. If untreated, the abscess can disappear on its own or, more often, it 
will continue to grow. The outer wall softens until it bursts, releasing a foul-
smelling pus. Often the goat loses hair on the site of the abscess.

190
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
You can encourage the abscess to ripen by applying hot compresses, or 
you can lance it with a sharp scalpel. I usually check frequently and wait for 
the outer wall to thin out and make lancing easier. Always wear gloves to 
prevent contamination; use paper towels to absorb the pus, and burn them 
when you are done. Then put warm compresses on the wound several times 
a day to aid in healing. You can also put some triple antibiotic ointment on 
the area.
Infectious abscesses are not a big risk to the rest of the herd if they burst, 
although they can spread bacteria. On the other hand, the type of abscess in 
the upcoming section does put the other goats at risk.
Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA)
Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is a highly contagious disease caused by a bac-
terium, Cornybacterium pseudotuberculosis. These bacteria infect the lymph 
nodes and cause abscesses both inside and outside the body. When the 
external abscesses caused by the bacteria burst, CLA can spread among the 
herd. It can also be spread by body fluids and when an infected goat coughs. 
The bacteria can live in soil, on barn walls, and on other objects for years. 
Although no cure currently exists, you can vaccinate against the disease. 
(See Chapter 10 for more about vaccinations.)
If you discover an abscess that contains thick, greenish material, assume that 
it’s CLA, isolate your goat, and contact your veterinarian for further investiga-
tion. The vet can aspirate the contents of the abscess and have them tested 
by a lab.
 
You can avoid CLA in your herd by asking the person you’re buying goats 
from whether they vaccinate or have had it in their herd, and specifically in 
the animal you are buying or its parents. If you find that you have CLA in your 
herd, separate or remove that goat from your herd because of the risk to 
other goats. 
Hardware disease
Hardware disease is a life-threatening condition caused when a ruminant 
swallows metal, such as a nail or wire, usually in their feed. The metal per-
forates the reticulum when the rumen contracts. (See Chapter 2 for more on 
the reticulum.) Hardware disease is more likely to occur during pregnancy 
because the growing uterus puts pressure on that part of the body. The 
perforated reticulum gets infected and can lead to peritonitis. Symptoms of 
hardware disease are fever, anorexia, increased heart rate, and depression. 
The most common signs of advanced hardware disease are difficulty breath-
ing, extended head and neck, and standing or walking with back hunched and 
elbows out.

191
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
Goats rarely get hardware disease, but if they do, they may need surgery to 
remove the object, although antibiotic treatment can resolve it. To prevent 
hardware disease, use hay with strings rather than wire, don’t allow goats 
access to prior building sites, and remove any metal objects from their reach. 
Goats more commonly swallow strings, which can cause life-threatening 
impaction. Always keep things picked up and away from goat lips.
Johne’s Disease
Johne’s (pronounced YO-nees) disease is an infection of the gastrointestinal 
system caused by mycobacterium paratuberculosis, which is in the same family 
as tuberculosis and leprosy. Johne’s disease is chronic and eventually leads 
to death. A goat with Johne’s may not show signs for years but can still spread 
the disease to herd mates. Signs of the disease are poor coat, diarrhea, and 
wasting away. You can confirm that a goat has Johne’s by blood or fecal test.
Goats can get the disease from sheep or cattle, or even by drinking contami-
nated cow milk, but they can also spread it through oral-fecal contact. One 
infected goat in a herd can eventually spread it to all others and will contami-
nate the area where they live. The bacteria are somewhat hardy and can sur-
vive for months in dirt.
To prevent the spread of Johne’s in your herd, either cull the positive goats 
or separate them and do not breed them. Contact your veterinarian to 
develop a herd-health program.
 
If you have had any goats that didn’t have parasite problems die by just wast-
ing away, consider testing your herd for Johne’s. If you are just getting goats, 
ask whether they have been tested for Johne’s disease and whether the prior 
herd has had any unusual deaths. The only way to confirm that the goat 
doesn’t have the disease is a negative test. (See Chapter 10 to find out about 
testing for Johne’s disease.)
Listeriosis
Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that goats can get from contaminated sile-
age, soil, and feces of other mammals. Some goats are carriers and never 
show signs of the disease. You see it more often in the spring and winter, 
mainly in goats that are indoors all the time.
Goats with listeriosis lose their appetites, become disoriented and 
depressed, walk in circles, and have paralyzed faces and drooling. Adult 
goats are more likely than kids to get listeriosis. It’s often mistaken for polio-
encephalomalacia (see the section “Nutrition-related Problems”), so I recom-
mend treating for that disease as well as listeriosis.

192
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Goats with listeriosis are more likely to survive when you catch the disease 
early and treat it aggressively with steroids and high doses of procaine penicil-
lin every six hours. If your goat has symptoms of listeriosis, contact your veter-
inarian immediately so that you can begin treatment right away. Like any other 
illness, you need to make sure that the goat is eating and drinking enough.
 
Listeriosis is contagious to humans and can be passed in milk, so do not drink 
milk from a goat that has had the disease within the past month. Even pas-
teurization does not kill listeriosis.
Soremouth
Soremouth, also known as orf, is a contagious skin disease that affects goats, 
sheep, and humans. Soremouth usually start as blisters around the mouth 
but can also affect the nose, the udder, the eyes, the throat, the tail, or other 
body parts that have a cut or scratch. In some cases, it can even affect the 
rumen and lungs. After the blister stage, the lesions turn into pustules and 
become scabby when they break. These scabs contain the virus, which can 
stay alive for years, and are contagious.
Because of their developing immune systems, young kids are more suscep-
tible, and if they get soremouth can spread it to their mothers’ udders. Goats 
that contract soremouth normally develop a strong immunity and can’t be re-
infected for a year or longer. Most animals recover easily as the disease runs 
its course, but they are at risk of a secondary infection or fly infestation that 
can complicate the disease.
Soremouth is usually extremely infectious, although in some cases, only a 
few animals are affected. I brought it into my herd with the purchase of an 
asymptomatic goat, and only four out of 20 goats contracted it. I have not 
encountered it in my herd since.
If your goats get soremouth, expect it to last from a week to a month. The only 
thing you need to do is keep the area clean and try to keep flies and other 
insects off of them. (See Chapter 5 to find suggestions for controlling flies.) If a 
goat develops a secondary bacterial infection, contact your veterinarian about 
treating with an antibiotic. In cases where a goat develops soremouth lesions 
in his mouth or throat, you need to make sure that he is able to eat.
When my goats got soremouth, I tried treating one goat with tea tree oil and 
one with triple antibiotic and did nothing to the other two. The course of the 
disease was the same in all cases. If you decide to treat, make sure to wear 
gloves, because you can contract the virus.
You can quarantine the animal to prevent spread of the disease, but in mild 
cases I recommend exposing the other goats so they develop immunity. As 
with other diseases, prevention is the best policy, so ask sellers whether any 

193
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
goats in their herd have soremouth. Another option is to consult your veteri-
narian about vaccinating your goats against soremouth.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs caused by parasites, CAEV, CLA, 
a sudden change in weather, viruses, poor nutrition, the stress of transport, 
or poor ventilation. Healthy goats normally have some bacteria in their lungs 
but have antibodies to protect them. Newborn kids can be prone to pneumo-
nia because they are still developing immunity, but colostrum provides some 
antibodies.
 
The most important things you can do to prevent pneumonia are to provide 
your goats a clean, uncrowded, and well-ventilated environment; make sure 
they are not stressed; and watch for other problems (such as a virus or lung-
worms) that can impair the lungs.
Kids that get pneumonia may exhibit the following symptoms:
 
✓ Coughing
 
✓ Lethargy
 
✓ Moderate fever
 
✓ Rapid breathing
 
✓ Refusal to nurse
 
✓ Runny nose
 
✓ Weight loss
 
If you don’t notice the pneumonia right away, kids’ lungs can be damaged. 
Even kids that recover may be more prone to further pneumonia, develop a 
chronic cough, or not grow well.
Signs of pneumonia in adult goats include 
 
✓ A temperature of 104° to 107° Fahrenheit
 
✓ A moist, painful cough
 
✓ Difficulty breathing
 
✓ Discharge from the nose or eyes
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Depression (dullness, isolation from the herd, and indifference to being 
handled)

194
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
If you have a goat with signs of pneumonia, make sure that it is getting enough 
water. Just like in humans, the adage “Drink water and get plenty of rest” is 
good advice. You may need to tube-feed a kid (see Chapter 13), or have your 
veterinarian put an IV in an adult.
Work with your veterinarian to determine whether an antibiotic or pain medi-
cation is needed and what is appropriate. Some goat owners, particularly 
those with large herds, vaccinate their goats against pneumonia caused by 
two different bacteria, Pasteurella multocida or Mannheimia haemolytica.
Wounds
Goats often get minor wounds on their faces and, in does, on the udder. 
Goats with horns are more likely to give or receive more major wounds, and 
bucks are most likely because they often fight with each other.
To prevent infection, clean a minor wound with warm, soapy water and treat 
with a spray-on antiseptic such as Blu-Kote or a 7% iodine mixture. Check 
the wound regularly to ensure healing and repeat the treatment, if necessary. 
Make sure the goat is current on its tetanus vaccination.
Promptly contact a veterinarian if your goat suffers a major wound or a 
broken bone. 
Ringworm
Ringworm is a fungus that leaves a circular, crusty patch of hair loss, most 
frequently on a goat’s head or neck. It’s contagious to other goats and to 
humans and is sometimes spread by cats that have no symptoms. It usually 
occurs in the winter, when goats spend more time indoors.
Sunlight often resolves ringworm, but if you want to treat it, use gloves and 
wash the affected area with warm, soapy water, rinse carefully, and apply an 
antifungal cream, such as Clotrimazole. In severe cases, isolate the goat until 
the ringworm clears up so it doesn’t spread throughout the herd.
Foot rot
Foot rot is a bacterial infection that occurs when a goat spends a lot of time in 
a wet, muddy area with untrimmed hooves. It causes lameness, foul-smelling 
feet, and black areas where the hooves join the foot.

195
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
You can prevent foot rot by keeping your goats’ hooves trimmed and giving 
them a dry area to live in. If a goat does get foot rot, move him to a dry area, 
and gradually trim down overgrown hooves. (Chapter 9 tells you about trim-
ming hooves.) Treat the goat with copper or zinc sulfate, such as Koppertox 
or Dr. Naylor Hoof n’ Heel, by pouring it on or soaking the feet daily until the 
hooves are back to normal.
Examining Feed-Related Problems
Making sure your goats have proper nutrition is one of the most important 
things you can do as a goat owner. Many health problems can be traced back 
to what your goats ate or didn’t eat.
Scours
Scours is the term that livestock owners use to talk about diarrhea in their 
animals. Scours is one of the most common problems in kids as they adjust 
to food. Too much milk at one feeding or too much grain can cause scours in 
kids. So can coccidiosis, enterotoxemia, a bacterial infection such as E. coli 
or salmonella, or even pneumonia. Adults can also get scours as a symptom 
of another illness or, more frequently, in response to too much grain.
 
You can help prevent scours by keeping the goats in a clean environment, 
increasing milk or feed gradually, and making sure the goats get plenty of 
clean water, exercise, and fresh air.
At the first sign of scours, do the following:
 
✓ Stop milk and grain.
 
✓ If scours are severe, give some kaolin pectin. In mild cases, this is all you 
need to get the goat back to normal.
 
✓ Make sure that the goat is drinking plenty of water.
 
✓ If a goat seems weak, give her some commercial or homemade electro-
lytes. (See sidebar “Making homemade electrolytes.”) Always wait at 
least an hour before giving milk to a kid who has gotten electrolytes, and 
never mix the two.
Contact a veterinarian and ask for a fecal test if
 
✓ Scours continue for several days despite treatment.
 
✓ Scours are frequent and completely liquid.
 
✓ Scours are bloody or black.

196
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ The goat is weak.
 
✓ The goat refuses to eat.
 
✓ The goat exhibits signs of pain such as teeth grinding.
Bloat
Bloat is caused when too much gas is trapped in the rumen. Gas is created 
during digestion, but normally a goat can belch to release it. When the goat 
can’t belch and too much gas builds up, she can die.
Goats are most likely to become bloated in the springtime, when they first 
have access to lush pasture. They can also become bloated from overeating 
grain or from getting something stuck in their throat that blocks the release 
of gas. Alfalfa and clovers put goats at a higher risk for bloat.
 
If your goat’s left side is bulging, he’s lethargic, not eating, and grinding his 
teeth (a sign of pain), he may have bloat. In severe cases a goat lies down and 
doesn’t want to stand up.
If you have a bloated goat, follow this advice:
 
✓ If the bloat is caused by grasses
 
• Using a drenching syringe, give the goat a cup of mineral or 
corn oil.
 
• Offer baking soda free choice (left out in a container so he can 
eat it whenever he wants).
 
✓ If the bloat is caused by grain
 
• Using a drenching syringe, give the goat milk of magnesia. (Give 
15 ml per 60 pounds.)
 
• Remove drinking water until the problem has cleared up.
 
✓ For either type of bloat
 
• Walk the goat.
 
• Massage the goat’s left side.
 
• Situate the goat so that his front legs are higher than his back legs. 
(You can have him stand with his front legs on a step.)
 
• Offer the goat roughage such as straw, tree branches, or black-
berry leaves when he’s ready to eat again.

197
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
Enterotoxemia 
Enterotoxemia is also called overeating disease because it comes about when 
a goat eats too much grain, lush grasses, or milk. This slows digestion and the 
intestine becomes poisoned by Clostridium perfringens type C or D bacteria, 
which normally live there. Enterotoxemia occurs more often in kids but can 
also affect adults — usually when they’re under stress, such as from kidding.
In some cases, an affected goat shows no symptoms and then will go down 
(lie down and be unable to get up) and never recover. More often the goat 
develops a high temperature, severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, 
and loss of interest in food and other goats. Kids with enterotoxemia often 
cry loudly. In some cases, the goat has seizures or throws its head back. 
Treatment is generally ineffective. Sadly, only a necropsy after the goat dies 
can definitely tell you that the goat had enterotoxemia.
Adult goats are more likely to have intestinal bleeding and die from entero-
toxemia — sometimes within 24 hours. They can also get an intermittent 
relapsing, and chronic forms of the disease. Both the intermittent relapsing 
and the chronic enterotoxemia cause a loss of appetite and diarrhea, but 
treatment is more likely to be effective.
If you have a goat with symptoms of enterotoxemia
 
✓ Think about what he ate recently. If the goat recently got into grain 
or you increased the amount of grain fed, you may be dealing with 
enterotoxemia.
 
✓ Stop feeding grain and/or milk. Both of these feeds only add to the 
problem. 
Making homemade electrolytes
You can have a goat that’s dehydrated from 
diarrhea drink this solution; if he is too debili-
tated, give the solution in a feeding tube. This 
mixture gives the goat energy and helps keep 
him hydrated.
You need
 ✓ 1 teaspoon salt
 ✓ 3⁄4 teaspoon lite salt
 ✓ 1 teaspoon baking soda
 ✓ 4 ounces corn syrup
 ✓ Four pints warm water
Mix all ingredients together. Give a large dairy 
goat one pint; give a kid or smaller goat 1⁄2 to 1 
cup every six hours until she regains her energy 
and diarrhea stops.

198
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ Make sure that the goat is hydrated. Dehydration can kill the goat.
 
✓ Feed roughage such as straw or branches. Roughage helps the rumen 
start working again.
 
✓ Give the goat CDT antitoxin as soon as possible. If you give the antitoxin 
and the goat improves, it is likely to have enterotoxemia.
 
Because treatment usually comes too late, prevention is important. Keep the 
goats’ area clean and avoid a sudden introduction of or increase in milk or 
feed. Make sure to keep grain and other concentrates in an area that the goats 
cannot reach. Goats are smart and sneaky; if they know where the food is, 
they’ll try to get to it. Most veterinarians recommend vaccinating with CDT 
toxoid. (See Chapter 10 for more about vaccinations.)
Nutrient imbalances
Nutrition-related problems are often caused by improper feeding — mainly 
when goats get too little or too much of certain trace minerals. You can’t 
always know how much of these minerals are in certain feed or how cer-
tain feeds will react with others, but you can follow certain guidelines. (See 
Chapter 9 for more about feeding.)
Copper deficiency
Copper deficiency is caused when the level of copper in goats’ feed is too low, 
or when too much of another mineral — such as zinc, molybdenum, iron 
or sulfur — in feed prevents them from using the copper that’s available. 
Unfortunately, the only way to definitively determine whether a goat’s copper 
level is adequate is on necropsy.
Signs of copper deficiency include a rough, faded coat, light-colored hair 
around the eyes, bald tail tips, immune deficiencies, mastitis, and myriad 
other problems. The first step in prevention is to using a proper mineral 
block.
 
Never use a combined sheep and goat mineral or a sheep mineral because 
they do not contain adequate copper for a goat.
Talk to breeders and veterinarians in your area to determine whether they 
have had problems with copper deficiency. If you continue to see signs that 
you believe might be caused by copper deficiency, work with a veterinarian 
or veterinary school to develop a solution for your herd.
Hypocalcemia (milk fever) and ketosis
Hypocalcemia, sometimes called milk fever, is a deficiency of calcium that 
some does get during the last month or two of pregnancy, or right after 
giving birth. It occurs because they aren’t getting the right balance of calcium 

199
 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
and phosphorus in their feed and are trying to support multiple fetuses or 
milk heavily.
A doe that develops hypocalcemia gets weak, loses her appetite, stops drink-
ing water, and eventually goes down and sometimes dies. Often the doe 
aborts her kids, which eradicates the hypocalcemia.
 
Ketosis often goes hand-in-hand with hypocalcemia. (See Chapter 12 for more 
about hypocalcemia and ketosis.) In ketosis, the body burns its own fat for 
energy, releasing ketone bodies (a by-product created by the breakdown of 
fatty acids) into the blood. A doe with hypocalcemia gets ketosis because she 
has stopped eating but still needs energy to grow the kids. A doe with ketosis 
goes down and is unable to eat, drink, or kid normally. Getting medical atten-
tion from a vet is urgent; otherwise, the doe and her kids are likely to die.
You can help prevent hypocalcemia by feeding alfalfa and grain to goats that 
are in their last two months of pregnancy and are lactating. Grass hay, which 
is adequate for the other goats, is often not enough for the demands of preg-
nancy, especially when a doe has multiple kids.
If a doe shows signs of hypocalcemia, the first step is to give her Nutridrench 
or oral propylene glycol twice a day and make sure she is getting enough to 
drink; doing so reverses or prevents ketosis. Then contact your veterinarian, 
who can give her CMPK (a combination of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, 
and potassium) to help get her system temporarily back to normal. The vet 
may also need to give the doe intravenous fluids. The most important step 
in treatment is to correct her diet, making sure that she is getting plenty of 
alfalfa and some grain (start slow and increase gradually if she has stopped 
eating).
Iodine deficiency
Goats normally get iodine from their mineral blocks, but eating too much of 
certain kinds of plants — including broccoli, kale, turnips, cabbage, and soy-
beans — can cause them to become iodine-deficient.
An enlarged thyroid gland, or goiter, is a sign of this condition. (The thyroid 
gland is in the goat’s neck just under the Adam’s apple.) Iodine deficiency 
also can lead to problems giving birth, and kids that are born to an iron-defi-
cient doe have short or fuzzy hair and large goiters.
Prevention includes making sure your goats have adequate iodine in their 
minerals and not feeding them large amounts of plants that can lead to iodine 
deficiency. Some people paint iodine on the bare area around the tail to treat 
the goiter. The only other treatment is to increase the iodine in their minerals 
and make sure they don’t eat problem plants.

Polioencephalomalacia
Polioencephalomalacia (goat polio) is a thiamine deficiency that causes cen-
tral nervous system disturbances, including brain inflammation. Goat polio 
is more common in a crowded herd. Bracken fern, moldy hay and grain, too 
much molasses, excess sulfur and the anticoccidial Corid (amprolium) all can 
cause goat polio, which is more common in the winter and occurs more fre-
quently in kids and young goats.
If a goat has lost its appetite and seems blind, staggers, arches its head 
back, or stares upward (called stargazing), think goat polio. The disease can 
be confused with listeriosis (which I discuss in the section “Acquainting 
Yourself with Goat Viruses and Infections” earlier in this chapter). As the dis-
ease progresses, the goat may go down, have seizures, and die within 24 to 
72 hours.
The only effective treatment for goat polio is administration of high doses of 
thiamine. High doses of fortified B-complex vitamins given subcutaneously 
can also help if you can’t get thiamine soon enough. Giving thiamine is safe at 
any time, so don’t wait for a lab diagnosis — if the goat responds to treatment 
and improves, you can conclude that the problem is polioencephalomalacia.
Selenium deficiency
The amount of the mineral selenium in the soil varies depending on where 
you live. The selenium level in soil affects the hay or other food grown on the 
land and consequently the goats that eat it, causing selenium deficiency or 
selenium toxicity.
Selenium works with vitamin E to keep animals healthy. Deficiency in dietary 
selenium and vitamin E can cause a variety of problems in goats, including 
muscle weakness, difficulty breeding and kidding, and stillbirths. In kids, it 
also leads to white muscle disease, in which kids become too weak to stand or 
nurse; sometimes they cough and have trouble swallowing, which can lead to 
pneumonia.
 
Beware of supplementing selenium without knowing whether your hay comes 
from a deficient area because you can cause selenium toxicity. Goats that have 
selenium toxicity can become anemic and blind and have neurological prob-
lems such as staggering or paralysis.
If your area is selenium-deficient, work with a vet to put your goats on a pro-
gram of supplementation, usually injections of BoSe (vitamin E and selenium) 
twice a year — a month before breeding season and then about a month before 
kidding in does. You can also keep BoSe (a prescription drug) on hand and give 
a kid with symptoms of white muscle disease a subcutaneous injection.

 Chapter 11: Addressing Common Health Problems and Ailments
Urinary calculi
Urinary calculi are stones in the urinary system. These stones can affect 
bucks but usually are a problem in wethers, particularly those that were cas-
trated too early. Any stones that form can’t get through the narrow opening 
of these goats’ urethras and so stop the flow of urine, causing death if not 
promptly treated.
 
Urinary stones in goats are usually caused by an imbalance in phosphorus or 
calcium. Phosphorus is in grains, and calcium is in alfalfa, so a simple solution 
to preventing these stones is to not give either of these to a wether. With a 
good-quality grass hay, a good mineral block, and plenty of fresh, clean water, 
wethers have everything they need. If you must give treats to wethers, use 
sunflower seeds and peanuts (in the shell), fruits, and vegetables. Salted, plain 
corn chips are an excellent treat because the salt encourages more water con-
sumption.
 
Urinary calculi are a medical emergency. The most obvious signs of urinary 
calculi are straining and inability to pee. If you notice a male goat stretched 
out trying to pee, check on him and then contact a vet immediately if he isn’t 
peeing. If you don’t deal with the problem right away, the goat will ultimately 
die a painful death as the toxins overcome his body or his bladder bursts.
Poisoning
Goats can be poisoned by a variety of substances, most often plants. (For a 
list of common poisonous plants, see Chapter 7.) Even if you’ve rid your back 
yard or pasture of poisonous plants, your goats can be poisoned by eating 
plants during an escape or when an unwitting person decides to give them 
some dangerous plants that they pruned or harvested. This most often hap-
pens with rhododendron or azaleas.
Certain plants that aren’t normally poisonous can cause nitrate poisoning if 
they’ve had too much fertilizer. These include oats, beets, alfalfa, some types 
of grasses and corn, and others.
Another kind of poisoning is prussic acid poisoning, which is caused by 
cyanide-producing plants such as cherry, corn leaves, certain types of grass, 
apricot, peach, and white clover. Prussic acid poisoning is more likely to 
arise from dried or wilted leaves. If you know that a goat was exposed to such 
a plant and it has bright red mucous membranes, contact your vet.

202
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
In severe cases, poisoning leads to death. Ideally, you’ll get some warning 
that a goat has been poisoned through symptoms such as
 
✓ Foaming at the mouth
 
✓ Vomiting
 
✓ Seizures
 
✓ Staggering 
 
✓ Crying
 
✓ Difficulty breathing
 
✓ Rapid heart rate
 
Any time one of your goats vomits, suspect poisoning. Goats do not normally 
vomit and when they do, it’s serious and you need to contact your vet. Time 
is of the essence when you’re dealing with poisoning, so don’t wait to see 
whether the goat gets better. Try to figure out what happened and contact 
your vet right away.
Treatment for poisoning depends upon the poison, and so the first step when 
you suspect poisoning is to figure out what the goat might have eaten and 
put it in a place that goats can’t get to it. Then call a veterinarian for help.
 
Always keep an activated charcoal product, such as ToxiBan, on hand. Orally 
administered activated charcoal is effective in cases where you know that 
your goat was poisoned by insecticide, rat poison, organophosphate, or alka-
loid (found in some plants). Do not use it for antifreeze poisoning.

reeding season occurs in the fall and is an exciting time of the year that 
you can feel (and hear) in the air. I can tell you from experience that all 
of your does will want to be bred. And if a buck is in the vicinity, even if you 
hadn’t planned to breed all of your does, they won’t let up for months until 
you do.
Be prepared to deal with a lot of craziness during this time and stick to your 
guns about which does you want to breed. Don’t let them get your goat!
In this chapter I cover goat breeding behavior, different ways to get a doe 
bred, and what to expect when she is pregnant.
Preparing for Breeding
Some goats can breed or be bred when they’re as young as two months 
of age, although the majority are not fertile until four to six months old. 
This range arises because goats are generally seasonal breeders and don’t 
develop heat cycles until the fall. Doe kids can usually be safely bred at seven 
months old — which means that they will kid at one year old — unless they 
are underweight or small in comparison to other does their age.

204
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
At the beginning of breeding season you need to do preventive maintenance 
on goats to ensure that they are in optimal condition and because you may 
not want to handle the bucks for a while (at least not without gloves and 
coveralls to protect yourself from the odor, which bucks get from peeing on 
their legs and faces and from scent glands on the head). This includes
 
✓ Giving a BoSe shot, if you’re in a selenium-deficient area (see Chapter 11)
 
✓ Trimming hooves
 
✓ Clipping the belly hair on bucks
 
✓ Testing for CAEV (see Chapter 10 for more about testing)
 
✓ Doing a fecal analysis and/or deworming
Handling the goats during this time gives you the opportunity to completely 
examine them to ensure that they don’t have any problems that may affect 
them during breeding season. In some cases, I discovered that a buck was 
much thinner than he appeared under a bushy coat. This told me that I 
needed to improve his diet and try to get some pounds on him before putting 
him through the ordeal of breeding season.
Running Through Goat Mating Habits: 
Courting Is Crucial!
Like many other animals, humans included, goats have their own mating 
rituals. I wish this book included sound so that you could hear some of the 
noises that come out of the bucks when they want to get the attention of the 
does or breed. The pawing, butting, snorting, and blubbering are all essential 
to breeding. The does play their role, and the bucks play theirs.
Identifying the season for goat love 
Goats are mostly seasonal breeders. Some of the mini breeds can be bred 
year-round, but in my experience their heat is most pronounced in the fall. 
Goats that live closer to the equator also may not have a seasonal heat but 
will ovulate throughout the year.
Beginning in late summer and early fall, the amount of daylight decreases, 
which signals the does to come into estrus (also called heat), which ends 
with ovulation (releasing eggs). From as early as July until January, does go 
into heat about every three weeks. At the beginning of breeding season some 
does short-cycle, which means they come back into heat in a shorter time 

205
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
than three weeks. Normally they cycle every 18 to 24 days thereafter, but if 
they continue to short cycle, you need to talk with your vet, as your doe may 
have a cyst on her ovary and won’t conceive until she gets a drug to break 
the cyst.
The decreasing daylight also signals bucks to go into the male version of 
heat — called rut. All they can think of is breeding (sound familiar?), so they 
stay up late, fight, and sometimes don’t eat right.
Manners, or what to expect from your goat
As the days get shorter, you can expect your goats to get more restless 
because the hormones associated with fertility kick in. Your goats will 
congregate along the fence line that is closest to the opposite sex and start 
wearing a path. During this time you need to start planning the breedings to 
best fit your schedule for kidding five months after the fact.
Does in heat
The heat cycle lasts from a few hours to a few days. You might not be able to 
tell that a kid is in heat but an adult doe usually creates quite a hullabaloo.
A doe in heat frequently exhibits visible physical changes: Her vulva may 
swell and become red, and she may have some vaginal discharge. Besides 
these physical changes, other signs that a doe is in heat are
 
✓ Flagging: One way to tell if a doe is in heat is vigorous tail-wagging 
(called flagging). I don’t know if she is signaling the buck or is just very 
happy.
 
✓ Vocalizing: Unless they want something, goats are usually pretty quiet. 
When a doe is in heat, she may make more noise than usual — from 
short bleats to longer calls.
 
✓ Parading: If a doe in heat can see the bucks, she will walk back and forth 
in his view and rub on the fence more than usual.
 
✓ Acting “buckish”: A doe in heat will mount other goats, or allow them to 
mount her, and may fight with other goats. These dominance behaviors 
are caused by hormonal changes that occur during heat. Some people 
keep a wether (castrated male) with the does as an indicator of heat, 
because he will also mount a doe at this time.
 
✓ Decreasing milk production: A doe in heat may spend so much time 
trying to attract bucks and fighting with the other does that she isn’t 
as interested in food. Because of this and the hormonal changes she is 
undergoing, she may temporarily (or even permanently) decrease her 
milk production.

206
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Bucks in rut
During rut, bucks are ready to breed and can think of nothing else. A buck in 
rut urinates into his mouth and on his chest, face, and beard, turning them 
yellow and sometimes causing urine scald with consequent hair loss. The 
resulting smell, caused by the urine and increased activity in the scent glands 
near the horns, leads people to think that all goats stink. But that smell also 
attracts does and brings them into heat.
During rut, bucks blubber, snort, grunt, and flehm, or make a distinct face 
that includes curling the upper lip. (The sidebar “Flehmen reaction” tells 
you more about this behavior.) They fight other bucks over the does, even 
if those does are unreachable. They mount each other in a wild display of 
dominance.
Bucks in rut can mate up to 20 times a day, although doing so puts them 
under a lot of stress. They often stop eating or eat less during rut, losing 
weight and body condition.
 
Supplement your bucks’ diet with some grain, leafy branches, and even beet 
pulp during this taxing time. If you have more than one buck, and particularly 
if you have more than two, you need to keep an eye on them to make sure that 
one of them isn’t getting injured by the others or sick from lack of food and 
excessive activity.
Flehmen reaction
Especially during breeding season (but at other 
times as well), you see goats holding their 
heads in the air and curling back their upper 
lips. This is called the Flehmen reaction. You 
see it more commonly in bucks, in response to 
a doe’s urine.
The Flehmen reaction causes the goat’s nostrils 
to constrict, pulling urine into the vomeronasal 
organ (an organ consisting of tubes that 
end in a pair of ducts between the nose and 
mouth). The vomeronasal organ helps identify 
whether a doe is in heat by analyzing hormonal 
products in the urine. Does are believed to 
use the Flehmen to detect whether bucks are 
sexually active, bringing them into heat.
I have also witnessed does putting their noses 
into their kids’ urine and flehming. A friend 
suggested that they were evaluating the health 
of the kids, and although no studies have 
investigated this, it makes sense. Other 
substances can trigger the Flehmen reaction, 
too, including feces, cigarette smoke, and wine.

207
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
Doing the deed
When a doe exhibits signs of heat, you can put her with a buck. He will act 
very interested and begin pawing and stomping with a front foot. He will stick 
out his tongue, blubber, and snort. If she urinates, he will put his nose in the 
stream and flehm. The doe will wag her tail repeatedly and stand still when 
the buck tries to mount her, although they may circle and go on with this 
foreplay for five or ten minutes first.
The sex lasts just seconds. I always let a buck breed a doe two or three times 
in a session to ensure that she is pregnant. If she doesn’t come back into 
heat, you can presume they were successful. If you have a young buck or one 
that you want to breed more than two does in a day, I recommend only one 
or two successful matings. Baby bucks have a limited amount of semen 
available.
In rare cases, even when a doe appears to be in heat, she may dislike a 
specific buck and refuse to be bred. Sometimes you can put her in a stall with 
the buck and she comes around, but other times she will do everything she 
can to get away. Older does often don’t like baby bucks, who either don’t 
smell sexy enough yet or are not aggressive enough and don’t woo properly.
 
You can sometimes trick a doe by letting her love a buck she likes through a 
fence and bring the buck you want to use behind her and let him breed while 
she is thinking about the other buck. You can hold a doe in place so the buck 
can breed her, but use your judgment. Like people, goats have preferences 
and may get overly stressed when forced.
Housing a buck after breeding
If you let your buck live with the does during breeding season, you need to 
start making plans for housing him when the kids are born. Not only will he 
be a pest when a doe goes into labor, but the risk of him re-breeding the doe 
too early is very real. That gives you about five months to get another area 
set up, if you don’t already have one.
If you have only one buck, you can put him in a fenced pasture adjacent 
to the does’. That way he can see them and interact with them. If you’re 
planning to move him to a more distant area, consider getting a wether or 
another buck as a companion, so he isn’t too lonely.

208

Finding Breeding Solutions When 
You Have Only Does
Many goat owners don’t keep bucks because they don’t have enough does to 
justify the cost and trouble of keeping one. They need separate quarters and 
another buck or wether for a friend, and they are very aromatic! And if you 
have an urban farm, they may not even be allowed by the municipality you 
live in.
 
When you don’t have your own buck, you need to pay for buck service to get 
your doe bred. Find out from the breeder what he charges for this service, and 
if you plan to register the kids born to your doe, you need to remember to get 
a service memo from the breeder after your doe is bred. A service memo is a 
document signed by the buck owner verifying that his buck bred your doe and 
the approximate date. Most breeders give a second breeding free if the doe 
doesn’t become pregnant.
In this section, I give you ways to tell whether your goats are in heat and get 
them bred if you don’t have a buck.
The invaluable buck rag
A buck rag is a piece of cloth that has been rubbed on the head, neck, chest, 
or beard of a buck that is in rut and then stored in a jar. These parts of his 
body are covered with his perfume. A buck rag is a great tool to tell you when 
a doe is in heat if no buck is around. It usually drives the does crazy!
 
If you’re a novice goat owner and are having trouble telling when one of 
your does is in heat, ask another breeder who has bucks if you can come 
and get a buck rag. Then when you think a doe might be in heat, just pull 
out the buck rag. Although you can’t always tell with a young, inexperi-
enced doe, the buck rag usually elicits a noticeable response. The doe 
starts flagging, getting excited, rubbing on the rag, and vocalizing.
The response you get from a doe that has smelled the buck rag tells you 
whether it’s time to try to bring in a buck, take her on a date, or artificially 
inseminate her.

209
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
Leasing a buck
A common method for getting your does bred without having to keep a buck 
is to lease one. Leasing a buck may not require any additional space, if he can 
live with the does during the time required for breeding. If you have more 
than one breed or does you don’t want to breed, you need a separate pen for 
the leased buck.
I leased a buck for my first two does. The buck, Harley, got to come and 
live with a couple of hot chicks for about six months — probably the best 
six months of his life. The girls and I liked him so much that we let him stay 
almost until the kids were born. (You don’t want a buck in with a doe that 
has recently kidded, because she can get re-bred very quickly.)
Talk to local breeders about leasing a buck. Make sure the buck is healthy. 
(See Chapter 7 to find out about knowing a healthy goat from a sick one.) If 
you can find an acceptable buck, the price is usually reasonable (a lot less 
than keeping one). You will have to negotiate the length of time you keep 
him. Unless you see him breed your goats, you need to have him for at least 
three weeks, so they can go through a full breeding cycle.
Less commonly, a breeder will have a separate space that can accommodate 
one or two does, along with the breeder’s buck, for a short-term live-in 
breeding. If you can stand to have your girls gone for a month or so, consider 
this option.
One-night stands, or driveway breeding
Driveway breeding is the most common method used by goat owners who 
don’t have a buck. Usually you take the doe to the buck.
You need to talk to the buck owner beforehand, so that she will be expecting 
your call. Then when your doe shows signs of heat or responds to the buck 
rag, you put a collar and a long leash on her, load her up in your vehicle and 
drive her to the farm where the buck lives.
Some buck owners have a separate stall to put the breeding animals in, but 
generally you just take the goat out of your vehicle and hang on to her on the 
long leash while the buck owner lets his goat out. When they are done you 
still have control to end the romance and get her back in your vehicle.

210
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Artificial insemination
Artificial insemination (AI) involves collecting buck semen and transferring 
it to a doe’s reproductive tract. The semen is usually frozen and kept in a 
nitrogen tank, and then thawed prior to use.
Artificial insemination is a less common method of breeding goats, usually 
reserved for bucks and does with outstanding genetics. AI enables you to use 
semen from bucks that aren’t available to you and also to use semen from 
outstanding bucks that are deceased. The initial cost for purchasing the 
necessary equipment is high. The biggest cost is a liquid nitrogen tank for 
storing the semen.
If you are interested in this method, talk to other breeders who use it. You 
may be able to cut your costs by sharing a semen tank with other breeders, 
or another breeder may let you store some semen in theirs. You can also 
save by hiring a semen collector to retrieve the semen when she comes to a 
neighboring farm.
Looking Into the Finer Points 
of Goat Pregnancy
After your doe is bred, you don’t need to do much right away. For the first 
three months you won’t even be able to tell that she is pregnant, unless she 
has multiple kids gestating and starts widening early. If she’s still milking 
from the prior year’s kidding, you can continue to milk until she is three 
months along.
You don’t need to change her feed right away, either. As long as she is 
already getting good nutrition, she will be fine. But when she reaches the 
three-month mark, you need to adjust her ration. (Chapter 6 tells you about 
feeding for pregnancy.)
Length of gestation
A goat’s gestation (the time between breeding and birth) is approximately 150 
days, although it can vary between 145 and 155. Nigerian Dwarves frequently 
kid at only 145 days, and goats that have poor body condition or nutrition 
often kid later than 150 days.

211
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
 
Always write on your calendar 145 days after the date that a doe was bred as 
the due date. You can start checking her ligaments and watching her around 
this time. (See the upcoming section “Knowing When She Will Kid (And What 
to Do!”) You can find a due-date calculator online if you want to save the 
trouble of trying to calculate the date.
False pregnancy
False pregnancy, or pseudopregnancy, is not an uncommon phenomenon in 
goats (and some other animals). In a false pregnancy, the goat has all the 
signs of being pregnant, such as an enlarged udder, milk production, and 
uterine cramping. During false pregnancy, a pregnancy test will even come 
out positive because the hormone progesterone is being produced just like 
in a real pregnancy.
False pregnancy is sometimes linked to uterine infection. It can end at any 
time but most often goes full term and ends in a cloudburst, or the release of 
fluid but no kid or placenta. The goat will then go back into her normal cycle 
and can be bred again.
False pregnancy is frustrating for an owner who has waited five months for a 
goat to kid, but usually it isn’t any more than an annoyance.
Dealing with common pregnancy problems 
Most pregnancies are uncomplicated. You can help to ensure that problems 
don’t arise by providing proper feed and shelter and paying attention to your 
herd’s health. 
The upcoming sections tell you about some of the most common problems 
that do occur in pregnancy.
Abortion and stillbirth
Abortion is when a pregnancy ends before it reaches full term. When a kid is 
born dead at term, it is a stillbirth. Both of these problems can have a variety 
of causes, including the following:
 
✓ Malformation or genetic defect: Kids with genetic defects are usually 
aborted early in the pregnancy, and often you may not even know the 
goat was pregnant. These abortions cannot be prevented.

212
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ Stress: Stressors such as poor nutrition, cold weather, overcrowding, or 
poor diet can lead to abortion. You can prevent these stressors by 
providing proper shelter, not housing too many goats in a small area, 
and feeding a balanced diet. (Chapter 6 tells you more about feeding 
during pregnancy.)
 
 Avoid transporting a pregnant doe or moving her to an unfamiliar place 
during her last month of pregnancy. The stresses can cause her to abort.
 
✓ Infectious diseases: Fifty percent of abortions in goats are believed to 
be caused by infection. The list of infectious diseases that can cause 
abortion is quite lengthy. (See Table 12-1.)
 
 Infectious abortions are a risk for the whole herd, particularly other 
pregnant goats. If more than one goat aborts, save the fetus and placenta 
in the refrigerator and call your veterinarian or veterinary school to 
perform a necropsy (examination after death) to determine the cause of 
death.
 
✓ Poisoning: Some plants and medications, such as certain dewormers 
and steroids, can cause abortions in goats. (See Chapter 4 for information 
about poison plants.)
 
✓ Injury: Occasionally a hard butt in the side by another goat will cause a 
doe to abort.

Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia, often called milk fever, is a deficiency of calcium in the blood 
that arises when a doe doesn’t get enough calcium in her diet to support her 
needs and the needs of her unborn kids. It most commonly occurs at the end 
of pregnancy, but does can also get it during lactation, especially if they are 
heavy milk producers.

213
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
Signs that a goat is developing hypocalcemia are a loss of appetite, particularly 
for grain, at 12 weeks of pregnancy or later — even after kidding. This loss 
of appetite leads to progressive weakness, staggering, depression, low 
temperature, and lethargy. These symptoms are caused because the muscles 
are not getting the calcium they need to operate. Eventually, a goat with 
hypocalcemia will go down and not get up and, without treatment, she will die.
You can prevent hypocalcemia by making sure that the doe has an adequate 
diet during pregnancy and lactation. She needs alfalfa for calcium, and getting 
too much grain early on can interfere with her getting it. She needs about two 
parts calcium to one part grain.
The steps you need to take to prevent hypocalcemia are different, depending 
on whether the goat is lactating (and getting grain and alfalfa) at the time she 
is bred:
 
✓ If she is lactating and getting a heavy ration of grain and alfalfa at the 
time of breeding, continue this grain ration throughout the pregnancy. 
Continue giving alfalfa unless you dry her off (stop milking) before she is 
three months pregnant. If you dry her off, switch to grass hay until the 
three-month mark).
 
✓ If she is bred when dry, do not give grain or alfalfa until the last two 
months of the pregnancy. Start slowly with only a handful of grain, and 
gradually increase the amount of grain you give her. Slowly replace her 
grass hay with alfalfa.
 
To feed alfalfa only to does that are pregnant, use alfalfa pellets, which they 
can eat along with their grain on the milk stand.
To treat hypocalcemia, immediately give the doe Nutridrench (according to 
directions on the bottle) or 60 ml of oral propylene glycol twice a day. This 
will give her the energy she needs to go on. Then contact your veterinarian to 
start her on 30 ml CMPK, a prescription combination of calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus, and potassium, subcutaneously every two hours to address the 
mineral imbalance, and provide intravenous fluids, if necessary. You can tell 
that this is working if her heart rate returns to normal. You may need to 
continue giving the CMPK on a daily basis until she kids, especially if she 
develops the same symptoms. (See Chapter 11 for more about hypocalcemia.)
 
If the goat is within five days of kidding and doesn’t get better right away, ask 
your veterinarian for a drug called Lutalyse to induce kidding and eliminate 
the stress of supporting the kids.
Ketosis
Ketosis is a metabolic imbalance that usually goes hand-in-hand with 
hypocalcemia. It is caused when a goat doesn’t get enough energy because 

214

she has stopped eating. The body then releases fatty acids that are used 
by the liver, which produces ketone bodies (by-products produced by the 
breakdown of fatty acids for energy). (See Chapter 11 for more about 
ketosis.)
Ketosis is more common in does that are overweight at the beginning of 
pregnancy and in those that have multiple fetuses. A doe with ketosis has 
sweet-smelling breath in addition to the symptoms of hypocalcemia. Treat 
ketosis with propylene glycol or Nutridrench, and also treat for hypocalcemia. 
(See the section “Hypocalcemia.”)
Getting Ready for Kidding
To make kidding go more easily and protect both dam (mother) and kids, you 
need to take certain precautions before kidding. In this section, I talk about 
routine pre-kidding care for the dam and how to prepare a kidding area.
Preparing the doe
During the last two months of pregnancy you need to do some routine care 
to make sure that the doe and you have an easy kidding. You can take a few 
simple steps to ensure that everything goes well both during and after the 
kidding:
 
✓ Give a BoSe shot. If you are in a selenium-deficient area give (or 
have your veterinarian give) her a BoSe shot, which is a prescription 
selenium/vitamin E combination, five weeks before the expected kidding 
date. Doing so helps prevent uterine dystocia (abnormal labor), aids in 
passing the placenta, and helps prevent white muscle disease in kids. 
(Chapter 13 tells you more about white muscle disease.)
 
✓ Vaccinate with CDT toxoid vaccine. If you vaccinate your goats, give a 
CDT booster shot four weeks prior to the expected kidding date. Doing 
so provides the new kids with some immunity from enterotoxemia and 
tetanus in the first few months of life. Chapter 10 tells you more about 
this vaccine.
 
✓ Trim the tail and udder area. I like to trim the tail and udder area a 
week or so before the expected kidding date to help the doe stay cleaner 
during and after kidding. For goats with hairy udders, a trim makes it 
easier for kids to find the nipple and start nursing. A few weeks after 
kidding, the doe will develop some bloody discharge that builds up 
around the tail area. Removing the hair that the discharge normally 
sticks to minimizes the build-up.

215
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
 
✓ Stop milking. If your goat is still lactating, you need to stop milking her 
for the last two months of the pregnancy so that her energy goes into 
growing the kids and preparing her body for the pregnancy. She won’t 
need as much grain when she stops milking, but don’t decrease it 
suddenly.
Setting up a kidding pen
Start getting a pen ready for kidding a few days before the pregnancy reaches 
the 145-day mark. Clean any used straw or wood shavings from the pen, 
sanitize the walls with bleach water (especially if the pen was used previously 
for a sick goat or for another kidding), and put in a thick layer of fresh straw 
or wood shavings. Sanitize an empty bucket and have it ready for water when 
the time is right.
 
A baby monitor is a big help for identifying when the time has come for you to 
go help with kidding. If you have one, set it up when you prepare the kidding 
pen and put the receiver where you can hear what is going on when you’re not 
in the barn. If your goat is in an early stage of labor you may hear groaning, 
cries, or nothing at all. If the goat is in the second stage of labor (pushing the 
kid out) you are likely to hear loader cries, heavier breathing, or mama talk, a 
series of short cries meant only for newborns. Sometimes you will be alerted 
by the cry of a newborn kid.
Prepare or check your kidding kit to make sure you have all the supplies you 
need and wait for the goat to kid.
Being prepared with a kidding kit
You can take a lot of the stress out of kidding just by being prepared. That 
means having a clean, separate kidding area, knowing when your goat is 
going to kid, and having the supplies that you need for a routine kidding or 
for a kidding that doesn’t go according to plan.
Putting together a kidding kit takes a little time up front, but it saves you time 
and trouble in the long run. At a minimum, make sure you have the following 
items available at kidding:
 
✓ 7 percent iodine for dipping cords
 
✓ A film can or prescription bottle to hold iodine when you dip cords
 
✓ Flashlight, if you don’t have good lighting in your kidding area

216
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ Phone numbers for
 
• Your veterinarian in case of complications that you can’t handle
 
• A more experienced goat owner for questions about kidding that 
you think you may be able to handle
 
✓ Dental floss for tying cord before cutting
 
✓ Bulb suction for clearing kids’ nostrils or airway
 
✓ Old towels (one for each kid you expect, plus an extra)
 
✓ Betadine surgical scrub for washing the goat and your hands if you need 
to assist with the delivery
 
✓ Sterilized surgical scissors for cutting the umbilical cord 
 
✓ Disposable examination gloves
 
✓ K-Y Jelly or obstetrical lube 
 
✓ A feeding syringe and tube for feeding weak kids (See Chapter 13)
 
✓ Empty feed bags to put under goat and to use for after-kidding clean-up
 
✓ Empty pop bottle with Pritchard teat, in case you need to bottle-feed
 
If you don’t have a hot water supply near the kidding area, bring a bucket of 
warm water for washing up. In a pinch, you can use a mild dish soap for 
washing your hands and your doe’s vulva. You can also use soapy water for 
lubrication if you have to assist the doe.
Knowing when she’ll kid 
(and what to do!)
As the time nears for your goat to kid, you may get just as nervous as she 
does. She most likely can kid on her own, but you want to make sure that she 
has a clean, safe place to do so. I give you a few tips on how to tell when your 
goat is getting close to kidding.
Reading the ligaments
A goat’s rump is normally flat and solid, but as a doe gets to the end of 
pregnancy, that changes. Her tailbone becomes elevated, and the ligaments 
that connect it to her pelvis begin to stretch and loosen in preparation for 
the journey the kid (or kids) will make from her body. Sometimes you can tell 
that she will kid soon when you see a hollow on either side of the tail.

217
 Chapter 12: Breeding and Looking After Pregnant Goats
One of the best ways to identify an impending kidding is to feel the two tail 
ligaments located on each side of the tail. Feel a doe that isn’t pregnant and 
you will notice that those ligaments are very firm. The same will be true of a 
doe that is pregnant but not ready to kid.
When these ligaments begin to get soft, and then completely vanish, you 
know that the goat is due to kid within 24 hours. You may make a mistake 
the first few times you try to read the ligaments, but over time you find the 
technique to be almost foolproof. Figure 12-1 shows you how to find the 
ligaments.
 
Figure 12-1: 
Check the 
ligaments 
on a goat to 
tell whether 
she is going 
to kid.
 
A few weeks before the doe is ready to kid, start feeling her ligaments 
routinely. One day you will find that they’ve turned to mush, and then you 
will know that it’s time to put her in the kidding pen.
Identifying other signs of impending kidding
Besides softened ligaments, a doe will show other signs of kidding. Each doe 
might exhibit different signs, so keep an eye out for a change in behavior. 
Some other signs to look for include
 
✓ Isolation: The doe stands off from the crowd, sometimes seeming 
“spaced out.”
 
✓ Mucus discharge: You may observe some whitish or yellowish discharge 
on her vulva.
 
✓ Firm, shiny udder: Her udder may become tight and filled up, called 
bagging up.
 
✓ Loss of appetite: She may become uninterested in food.

218
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
✓ Personality change: She may start fighting with other goats or become 
overly friendly to you when she was previously standoffish.
 
✓ Restlessness: She may lie down, then get up, paw at the ground, and just 
seem uncomfortable.
When you have checked her ligaments and they’re soft, or when you notice 
her exhibiting any or a combination of these signs around her due date, put 
her in the kidding pen, give her some fresh hay or alfalfa and observe her in 
this environment.
When you have determined to your satisfaction that this is the day, turn on 
the baby monitor and leave her to focus on the mysterious process of having 
a kid. Chapter 13 tells you about the kidding process.

In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what to expect from kidding
▶ Dealing with newborn kids
▶ Developing a feeding program 
N
othing is cuter than a baby goat. They usually come into this world 
with only their mother’s help, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared for 
problems, just in case. You also need to know how to help these little guys 
get off on the best foot and how to help their mother recover.
In this chapter, I address what to expect with kidding, how to deal with those 
newborn kids, and developing a successful feeding program to help them 
grow up strong and healthy.
Grasping the Basics of Kidding
For thousands of years, goats gave birth to their kids without any human 
intervention. Those that had problems died, and their kids also may have 
died, while the goats that kidded easily survived. When we began to tinker 
with and “manage” goats, nature no longer ruled and goats that would have 
died began to survive.
Most goats can give birth without human help, but if you want to raise goats, 
you need to know the basics of kidding so you can help when you have to.
Unless you discovered your doe after she started active labor, after you get 
her in the kidding pen, you can leave her to the solitude that most animals 
prefer during labor. You can listen on a baby monitor and check on her inter-
mittently to see how she’s doing as she goes through the stages of labor. 
When she reaches the second stage of labor, you usually know that it’s time 
to be there because her breathing changes, and she makes loud cries as she 
is pushing the kid out.

220
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Knowing what to expect 
from labor and birth
In the first stage of labor the uterus contracts and dilates, forcing the unborn 
kid against the cervix (neck of the uterus). This process usually lasts about 
12 hours for goats that are kidding for the first time, but it can be longer or 
shorter. Every goat is different.
During this stage the goat will be restless, lying down and then getting up, 
unable to get comfortable. She may look at her side, like she can’t figure out 
what is going on. She also may lick herself, or even you, in anticipation of the 
kids coming out. Most goats want to be left alone during this time, and their 
labor may even slow down or stop if people are around. A doe that you’re 
very close to may react the opposite way — wanting you there comforting 
her. Some goats stand up to deliver their kid, and others lie down. Figure 13-1 
shows a doe lying down to kid.
 
Figure 13-1: 
A doe may 
lie down 
to deliver 
her kid.
 
The second stage of labor is when the doe pushes the babies out of her 
uterus. Her contractions get stronger and if the kid is lined up correctly, it 
will start moving down the birth canal.

221
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
 
If you’re listening on a baby monitor when the doe enters second stage, you 
may hear the doe cry out. (On the other hand, like people, some goats give 
birth silently.) From the time the goat starts pushing until the first kid is 
delivered should be only 30 minutes. If it takes longer than this, the kid may 
be malpositioned or the doe may have another problem. Investigate whether 
the kid is stuck or coming out wrong to determine whether you or a vet need 
to intervene.
You will see thicker discharge, sometimes tinged with blood, and then a 
bubble at the opening of the vagina. This is the amniotic membrane. If you 
look in the bubble you usually see a nose and one or two little hooves. 
Figure 13-2 shows you a goat in a normal position for birth.
 
Figure 13-2: 
In a normal 
birth pre-
sentation, 
the goat is 
positioned 
head first, 
with its 
hooves out-
stretched.
 
After the bubble appears, the doe will continue to gradually push the kid out, 
sometimes stopping to gather her strength. Sometimes she will circle around, 
try to get to that bubble, or lick at her sides or your hand, expecting a baby. 
Within a half hour, the baby will slide out, usually to the accompaniment of a 
yelling goat. Often kids are born in the caul (still in the amniotic membrane). 
This provides a cushion for an animal that drops a distance to the ground.

222
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
If the amniotic membrane doesn’t break when the kid comes out, break 
it and clean the fluids from the kid’s mouth and nostrils. The kid should 
breathe, cough, or shake her head to clear excess mucus. If the kid doesn’t 
start breathing right away, sticks her tongue out, or otherwise has difficulty 
breathing, swing it as I describe below.
Breech presentation (back feet first; see Figure 13-3) is another version of 
normal in goats. If kids are small, even a frank breech presentation (tail first) 
doesn’t present a problem. The risk in a breech birth is the possibility of 
inhaling amniotic fluid. A gentle, steady pull on the hind legs in a breech birth 
will help to ensure that the kid’s head comes out promptly.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The kid’s 
back feet 
are posi-
tioned first 
in a breech 
birth pre-
sentation.
 
 
I recommend swinging kids that were born breech to clean out any fluid they 
may have inhaled. I used to do it only when they had trouble getting started 
breathing, but after the death of a breech kid that had seemed all right, I now 
do it with every breech. To swing a goat kid:
 
1. Wrap a towel around the kid (the process can be messy).
 
2. Hold the kid by the feet with one hand and in the area between the 
head and neck with the other hand.

223
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
 
3. Swing it back and forth several times with head facing out to clear the 
lungs.
 
 Make sure you are in an area where you won’t hit anything and be aware 
that the kid is slippery.
 
4. Check the kid’s breathing and repeat the process if it isn’t breathing.
Another position that can cause a problem is front legs back. The birth is 
stalled and you see a nose (sometimes with a tongue hanging out of the 
mouth), but no hooves. That kid has its legs back and unless it’s very tiny, it 
won’t be getting out without some help. 
 
When a kid is in the front legs back position, you have to get the legs out so 
that the kid is in “diving” position, with its front legs stretched out alongside 
its head. Don’t try this unless you have experience or are very comfortable 
assisting. Your hands must be very clean and well-lubricated and you will 
need to push the head back into the mother, follow the neck down to the 
shoulder, locate the leg, carefully draw that hoof up, and bring it out as gently 
as possible to avoid scraping the uterus or vagina. The hooves are soft at 
birth, which helps.
Other positions that require assistance and can be difficult to reposition 
include transverse (across the uterus with a side near the cervix), head back 
(hooves out but head back, usually to one side), or even crown presentation 
(the top of the head coming first). The only doe of mine that ever had a cesar-
ean (surgical removal of the kid) was one with a kid whose crown was pre-
senting first. Neither the vet nor I could get the nose up to get him out.
If you encounter a kid in the wrong position, call a veterinarian or an experi-
enced goat owner to assist you or talk you through it. If you are unable to get 
the kid into the correct position you need to have a veterinarian perform a 
cesarean.
If you plan to bottle-feed the kid or raise it on CAEV prevention (removing 
kids from the mother immediately and feeding only pasteurized milk or milk 
replacer; see Chapter 11), take the kid as soon as it’s born and before the 
dam even sees it, because she will start cleaning it up instinctively. If the kid 
will be dam-raised, then you can help the mom with the clean-up. (See the 
section “What to do for newborn kids” to find out how.)
Handling multiples
If the doe is carrying more than one kid, you may barely be finished with the 
first (or second, third, or fourth) one before the next is on its way. Multiples 
usually are smaller, which means they come out more easily, but they also 
can get tangled up and be malpositioned, so that you or a veterinarian need 
to assist.

224
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
Even when they do well during the kidding, kids from births of three or more 
at a time can get lost in the shuffle and be neglected by a doe or be pushed out 
by a more assertive littermate. Mom has only two teats and if two of the kids 
are big, greedy bucks and one is a small doe, guess who will lose. Plan to 
spend more time and assistance right after kidding to make sure that such 
kids are getting what they need. In some cases, you will have to bottle-feed the 
smaller, weaker kids.
Taking Care of Mother and 
Kids after Kidding
After a kid is born, he needs to be cleaned, undergo a series of minor proce-
dures, and then demonstrate his innate nursing skills. His dam also requires 
attention after her hard work. In this section I tell you what to do for mother 
and baby after a kid is born and how to handle problems with newborn kids.
Caring for the new mother
The first thing to do when a doe is done kidding is to get her a bucket of 
warm water with a little molasses (about two gallons of water with ¼-cup 
molasses) for energy. My goats sometimes drink a whole gallon. Then get her 
some grain and some fresh alfalfa to munch on while her kids learn to walk 
and nurse, and while you wait for the placenta.
After a doe has kidded she goes into the third stage of labor: delivery of the 
placenta. This stage normally can take up to 12 hours, but usually the doe 
passes her placenta within an hour or two of kidding. If she has not done so 
within that time, contact your veterinarian. Dispose of the placenta by bury-
ing it deep, composting it, or burning it.
The dam will try to eat her placenta — most mammals do. I allow her to take 
only a few bites because I think that much might be good for her, but I don’t 
want her to choke on it — something that happened to my first goat, Jinx. 
Clean the kidding area of soaked straw and feed bags and add fresh straw. If 
you will be bottle-feeding, milk the doe out (milk all the colostrum out of her 
udder), heat-treat the colostrum if needed and feed it to kids or freeze it for 
emergency. (See the upcoming section “Caring for newborn kids” for how to 
heat-treat colostrum.)

225
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
Caring for newborn kids
I love watching the newborn kids try to stand, then go to a wobbly walk and 
eventually lurch toward their first food. They may complain about being han-
dled, but they need to be warmed and stimulated so they can get up.
After the birth of a single kid, or between the births of multiple kids, take 
these steps with each newborn:
 
1. Use a towel to help the dam clean the kid.
 
 Make sure you uncover the face first and determine whether the kid is 
breathing. If he isn’t breathing, rub the body to stimulate him; if that 
doesn’t work, swing him as I describe in the section “Knowing what to 
expect from labor and birth.” Stimulating the kid is critical to getting her 
to stand up, walk, and nurse.
 
 If you are on a CAEV prevention program or plan to raise the kids sepa-
rately on a bottle, don’t let the dam clean the kid. Instead wash the kid 
and put him in a separate box from other newborn kids until each has 
been washed and dried. (See Chapter 11 for more information on CAEV 
prevention.)
 
2. Tie the cord with dental floss and cut it about an inch from the kid’s 
body.
 
3. Dip the cord.
 
 Pour some iodine into a film can or prescription bottle and hold it over 
the umbilical cord stump up to the belly. Turn the kid to coat the whole 
cord. Treating the cord with iodine helps prevent navel ill. (See “Dealing 
with kid problems” to find out about navel ill.)
 
4. Check the kid for gender, number of teats, and any abnormalities.
 
5. Feed the kid.
 
 Put the kid under the dam if it will be dam-raised. Watch the kid for the 
next 15 minutes or so. If she has trouble getting latched and sucking 
well, help her out by moving her near the teat or putting the teat in her 
mouth. Some kids really resist; other little pigs (er, goats) latch on and 
don’t back down.
 
 Offer a warm bottle with several ounces of heat-treated colostrum if the 
kids will be bottle-fed. 
 
To heat-treat colostrum, heat it in a jar in a hot water bath to 135° Fahrenheit 
and hold it at that heat for one hour. Do not let the temperature go higher 
than 140° or below 130°. 

226
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
The importance of colostrum
Colostrum is the first milk that the doe produces for her kids; it’s rich in 
nutrients and proteins called immunoglobulins, which provide immunity 
against disease, and it stimulates the kids to expel meconium (the first feces) 
from their intestines.
One of the most important things to do for newborn kids is make sure that 
they get plenty of colostrum soon after birth. Ideally, they get their first 
colostrum within 30 minutes after birth. If you can’t do it in that time frame, 
do so as soon as possible. (Sometimes you have to heat-treat colostrum first, 
which takes about an hour; see the section “Caring for newborn kids.”) Kids 
are able to get the immunoglobulins only in the first few hours after birth.
 
Use one of the dried colostrum alternatives that you can buy at the feed store 
only when you have no other alternative. They don’t provide kids with the 
immunity they need. The ideal is goat colostrum, and disease-free cow colos-
trum is a better choice than the dried products.
When you have a doe that kids, milk out some colostrum to heat-treat, freeze, 
and use in the future for an orphaned kid or one that needs it for another 
reason. Healthy older does can provide greater volume and quality of colos-
trum. A dam produces colostrum for up to four days after kidding, but the 
best colostrum to freeze for later is what she produces during the first day. 
After that, her milk begins to come in and she produces a combination of 
colostrum and milk.
Dealing with kid problems
Kid problems seem to come in spurts — you can go years without problems 
and then one year a series of kids develops the same problem. You can trace 
some of these problems, such as white muscle disease or diarrhea, to a spe-
cific cause, but frequently you find yourself baffled about the cause. All you 
can do is treat the symptoms and watch the other kids to see whether they 
are affected.
In this section I tell you about some common — usually resolvable — problems 
that you may find in your newborn kids. 
Floppy kid syndrome
Floppy kid syndrome (FKS) is a disease in kids from 3 to 10 days old that 
causes sudden weakness and inability to move the legs. It was first docu-
mented in 1987, but its cause is still unknown.
FKS is more common later in a kidding season and can spread rapidly 
through the kids. The kids seem normal at birth and then suddenly don’t 

227
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
want to nurse and have very weak muscles; they stumble like they’re slightly 
drunk and eventually become limp as a wet dishrag. If you pick up one of 
these kids and gently shake her, you can hear liquid sloshing in her belly.
 
Treat any kid that you think might have this problem by giving a half-teaspoon 
of baking soda in 4 ounces of water. You can give this by bottle, but if kids 
refuse or are very weak, give it by tube-feeding. If the kid gets better within 
two hours, you can conclude that it had FKS.
Some kids get better and then relapse. Even if a kid responds to the baking 
soda, remove her from her mother, make sure she is warm, and keep her 
hydrated by giving electrolytes in a bottle for a day or two before resuming 
milk feeding. 
Some kids develop secondary enterotoxemia, which must be treated with 
CDT antitoxin, or pneumonia, which requires antibiotics. (See Chapter 11 for 
more about these conditions.)
White muscle disease
White muscle disease is caused by a deficiency of selenium or vitamin E. 
(Chapter 11 tells you more about selenium deficiency.) Signs of the disease 
include weakness, stiffness, and rapid difficult breathing. The disease is 
most common in kids less than two months old. Because it can cause sudden 
death, white muscle disease can be mistaken for another disease, such as 
parasitism or enterotoxemia. 
You can prevent white muscle disease by injecting the dam with BoSe prior 
to kidding and by giving an injection to the kid within a month after birth. 
As with FKS, you may only know that a kid has white muscle disease when 
he responds to the treatment. Otherwise you may not know until you have a 
necropsy done on a kid that has died.
 
Talk to your vet to find out whether you live in an area that is deficient in sele-
nium before routinely giving your goats BoSe because it can be toxic.
Navel ill
Navel ill (also called joint ill or polyarthritis) is an infection caused by bacte-
ria entering the kid’s bloodstream through the navel. Goats can get navel ill 
during their first month of life. Symptoms include lameness, inflamed painful 
joints, a swollen navel, and fever. The infection arises from unclean condi-
tions and from not treating the umbilical cord with iodine right after birth. 
(See the section “Caring for newborns” earlier in this chapter.)
The infection can spread to the joints from the bloodstream, which is called 
joint ill. To treat joint ill, soak the navel area with a clean, hot, wet cloth, 
remove scabs or pus, and apply iodine. Contact your veterinarian about 
which antibiotic to use.

228
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Hyperflexed legs
Every so often a kid is born with legs that seem to bend backward at the knee 
or that can’t seem to lock the joints. This condition is called hyperflexion. It 
usually corrects itself within a day or two. In cases where a kid doesn’t seem 
to be getting better, you can splint the legs by using a toilet paper roll or 
cardboard, duct tape or medical tape, and a little creativity.
Diarrhea (scours)
Newborn kids frequently get diarrhea (called scours in goats) because their 
immune systems are not yet developed. Kids that don’t ingest colostrum 
right after birth are more likely to get scours, and so are kids that live in 
unsanitary conditions or have inadequate diets. Inadequate diets include 
underfeeding, overfeeding, and poor quality food. 
When you find a kid with scours, evaluate whether he may have eaten too 
much grain or eaten something else that might be causing the problem. 
Eating too much grain or drinking too much milk can cause a kid to get 
enterotoxemia, which is an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the gut. (See 
Chapter 11 for more on enterotoxemia.)
At the first sign of diarrhea, give the kid kaolin pectin, collect feces for analy-
sis, and watch the kid carefully for the next few hours. The fecal exam will 
tell whether the kid has coccidiosis or is overrun with parasites and needs to 
be treated. (Chapter 11 tells you more about these common ailments.) If the 
diarrhea continues or gets worse, contact your veterinarian. Because entero-
toxemia can kill a kid quickly, many veterinarians recommend giving CDT 
antitoxin, even if the kid or his dam have received the CDT vaccine.
You not only want to fight the cause of scours but to make sure that the kid 
stays hydrated. A goat kid can dehydrate fast, leading to death. (Chapter 10 
tells you how to check for and treat dehydration.)
 
Have the goat drink the electrolyte mixture or give it with a feeding tube. Give 
a large goat a pint and a kid or smaller goat ½ to 1 cup every six hours as 
needed. Also make sure that the kid has access to roughage such as willow 
branches, salal, blackberry, or whatever grows in your area.
Most of the time, the scours are transient and go away within a day. Kids just 
have sensitive tummies, and the slightest change can cause diarrhea.
Milk goiter
Milk goiter is a soft swelling of the thymus gland, which is located on the 
neck. It is often mistaken for an enlarged thyroid, which is caused by iodine 
deficiency.

229
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
Milk goiter is not a problem in itself, but it can alarm goat owners and even 
veterinarians who aren’t familiar with it. Milk goiter is found in well-nourished 
kids, most commonly Nubians, but its function isn’t known. The first kid born 
on my farm had it. She was a piggy little girl who nursed for a long time. 
She had the swelling but no symptoms other than being overweight for her 
first year.
If you have a nursing kid with a soft swelling on the front of her neck, with 
no other symptoms, think of milk goiter. There is no good way to distinguish 
milk goiter from enlarged thyroid, but if you think the kid might have iodine 
deficiency, paint the tail web with 7% iodine and see if it helps. The treatment 
for milk goiter is to do nothing and wait for it to subside as the kid gets older.
Tube-feeding a weak kid
When a kid is born too weak, is unable to suck, or is too sick to nurse or 
drink out of a bottle, you need to get fluids into him to keep him alive. If the 
kid is a newborn, he needs colostrum. To boost the kid’s energy, add some 
corn syrup or Nutridrench to the colostrum.
For a weak kid that has already gotten colostrum, use electrolytes, B vita-
mins, probiotics, and goat milk or milk replacer. I keep on hand dried elec-
trolytes I got from my vet. If the goat is being tube-fed because of scours, the 
electrolytes give him energy and give the gut time to heal.
 
Stay away from milk or milk replacer for at least a day and never mix milk and 
water or electrolytes, to prevent digestive problems.
You may have to tube feed a weak kid only one time to get it up and ener-
gized. If you need to tube-feed a kid more than once, do it only every 2 to 4 
hours with the same small amount. Frequent, small feedings are better than 
infrequent large feedings.
To tube-feed a kid, you need the following equipment:
 
✓ Feeding tube
 
✓ 60 cc syringe with an irrigation tip
 
✓ Bowl of clean warm water 
 
✓ 6 cc syringe
 
✓ A helper

230
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
To tube-feed a kid, take the following steps:
 
1. Measure the distance you need to insert the tube so it ends up in the 
kid’s stomach.
 
 Measure from the nose to the center of the ear. Then measure from the 
ear down to the chest floor. Add the two measurements and mark the 
tube at that point. 
 
2. Have someone hold the kid securely so she is sitting up, not on her 
side. 
 
3. Hold the kid’s head straight up so the bottom of the chin and front of 
the neck are in a straight line. (See Figure 13-4.)
 
 If necessary, fold up a towel to prop up the kid’s head. This prevents 
aspiration, in the event the kid coughs up any fluids. 
 
4. Dip the end of the tube in the warm water to soften it, and then insert 
the tube into the kid’s mouth, over the tongue and down the throat 
until the length you marked is all the way in. 
 
 You may be able to feel the tube as it passes down the esophagus. Very 
weak kids won’t even struggle; bigger ones may fight you.
 
 If the kid was crying before you inserted the tube and suddenly stops 
during the process, pull it out until the kid can cry. Then try again. Tube 
feeding into the lungs has the same effect as syringing when the kid 
chokes — the kid can get pneumonia or die.
 
5. Determine whether the tube is inserted correctly by using one of 
these methods:
 
• Smell the end of the tube for the milk smell of the stomach. This 
obviously won’t work for newborns that haven’t had milk yet. 
 
• Listen at the end of the tube for little crackles. If you hear breath 
sounds, withdraw the tube and start over. 
 
• Place the end of the tube into a cup of water. If it blows bubbles, 
you are in the lungs and need to try again.
 
6. Inject about 5 cc of water into the tube with the 6 cc syringe to make 
sure it flows down the tube. 
 
 If not, withdraw it a few inches and try again. This step helps you make 
sure the tube isn’t against the stomach wall or twisted or blocked in 
some way.
 
7. After you have established that the tube is properly placed and the 
tube works, tube-feed the kid.
 
 Put 2 to 4 ounces of the feeding liquid into the syringe and attach the 
syringe to the end of the tube. Don’t use the inside part of the syringe; 
gravity will deliver the fluid to the stomach if you hold the syringe above 
the kid.

231
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
 
Figure 13-4: 
Keep a kid’s 
head up 
when you 
tube-feed it.
 
 
8. After administering the fluids, rinse the tube by adding up to another 
10 cc of water to the syringe. 
 
 This step is not critical, but it helps prevent the kid from aspirating the 
milk or electrolytes when the tube is being removed.
 
9. Remove the syringe and tube.
 
 Remove the syringe from the end of the tube. Then remove the tube 
slowly, with a finger over the end. Putting your finger over the end helps 
prevent excess fluids from getting into the lungs. Removing the tube too 
quickly can cause the kid some discomfort and possible tissue damage.
 
10. Clean and sterilize your supplies after each feeding.
Vaccinating
Most veterinarians recommend that you vaccinate kids with CDT (clostridium 
perfringens Type C & D and tetanus toxoid). This vaccine gives them some 
protection against enterotoxemia and tetanus. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
vaccinations.) 

232
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
If you choose to vaccinate your kids with CDT and their dam was vaccinated 
in the month before kidding, you don’t need to vaccinate the kids until they 
are six to eight weeks old. Give them a booster one month later.
If their dam was not vaccinated and you want to begin vaccinating, give the 
first vaccination when they are three weeks old and a booster a month later.
Feeding the Kids
 
Before your kids are born, figure out what and how you want to feed them. 
You have a lot of choices to make — bottle- or dam-raised, individual or group 
feeding, milk or milk replacer. Their little tummies don’t like change, so make 
a plan and stick to it (unless you have good reason to change the plan, such as 
switching to bottle if the mom gets sick or switching to milk if a kid develops 
diarrhea on milk replacer).
Kids nurse for at least the first 8 weeks of their lives and gradually switch 
over to hay and grain. They start tasting hay and grain as early as the first 
week, but they need to be eating solid food well before weaning. This gives 
you a little extra time to decide on and get a supply of solid food.
Deciding between hand-feeding 
or natural feeding
Dam-raising goats is the easiest way to feed kids after you’re sure that both 
parties have figured out how to do it. You just have to feed the mom and you 
don’t have to manage a frequent feeding schedule. But things don’t always go 
as simply as planned.
If a doe has more than three kids, you usually need to hand-feed a couple of 
them to make sure they are getting enough to grow and thrive. The doe may 
not have enough milk to go around or her health may suffer from feeding all 
those little mouths.
Another reason you may decide not to dam-raise is that a doe has a conta-
gious disease that you don’t want the kids to get. In this case, you will have 
pulled the babies at birth anyway.
Some people prefer to hand-feed their kids for other reasons: they want to 
prevent them from getting a disease the doe might have or they prefer the 
friendliness of hand-fed babies. You can raise kids that aren’t hand-fed to be 
friendly, too — it just takes more time, but these goats are genuinely friendly, 
not just coming around because they think you have food.

233
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
 
If you have the time and are milking the dam anyway, put some of the milk in a 
bottle after the morning milking and feed it to a hungry kid that has been 
locked up all night without his mom. (He may be resistant at first, but after he 
figures out that milk is in the bottle, he will suck it down.) This intermittent 
bottle-feeding has the benefit of associating you with food, which will make 
him tamer and friendlier, but not annoyingly so.
If you decide to hand-feed, you need to decide what method to use and what 
to feed. 
Choosing milk
Raw goat milk is the ideal food for a goat kid. Raw milk helps with immunity 
against diseases, and it contains the good bacteria a new kid needs to popu-
late his gut. If the dam is healthy, raw is best.
If the dam has CAEV or another transmissible disease, or if you are pooling 
the milk to be fed to kids, pasteurize it first. To pasteurize milk bring it to 165° 
Fahrenheit for 30 seconds. Cool as quickly as possible.
 
If you don’t have access to goat milk, or if you want all of the milk for your 
own uses, you can feed your kids cow milk or milk replacer. When feeding cow 
milk to kids, add some half and half because cow milk doesn’t have as much 
fat as goat milk. Feeding cow milk to kids can get expensive fast. You also 
need to make sure that the milk is free from Johne’s disease — something you 
might not be able to do when you buy commercial milk. (See Chapter 11 for 
more about Johne’s disease.)
If you use milk replacer, make sure that it is formulated for goat kids or, if 
a goat formulation isn’t available, use lamb milk replacer. You can also mix 
milk replacer with goat milk.
 
I have not had good luck with milk replacer and don’t recommend using it. 
More of my kids got diarrhea with it than with their mothers’ milk. I also prefer 
the ease of pouring cow milk rather than having to mix it up. 
Feeding individually or as a group
If you have only a few kids to feed, you can feed each one with an empty soda 
bottle with a Pritchard nipple (a red, soft latex nipple designed to replicate a 
ewe’s teat) screwed on the top. To get a kid to drink from a bottle, take the 
following steps:

234
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
 
1. Hold the kid on your lap between your legs with its head up in the 
position he would use when nursing.
 
2. Hold the bottle in your hand and slide it into the kid’s mouth.
 
 You may have to pry the kid’s mouth open the first few times.
 
3. Wrap your hand around the bottom of the kid’s muzzle, making sure 
to leave his nose clear, and hold his mouth closed while also holding 
the bottle in place.
 
 After the kid gets the hang of nursing from the bottle, you can just hold 
it at an angle above the kid and he will take the nipple and nurse.
If you have a lot of kids, you may soon tire of the one-on-one feeding (and the 
other kids jumping all over you at the same time) and consider a way to feed 
more than one at a time. For larger groups of kids, you can buy a milk feeder 
that is basically a bucket with holes drilled in the side and nipples sticking 
out. You can get one of these bucket feeders at a feed store or from a goat 
supply catalog or, if you’re handy, you can make one of your own.
 
Feeding a group of kids a mixture of milk from more than one doe can create 
potential risks for kids if any of the does contributing to that pool develops a 
health problem. Unless the milk is pasteurized, that doe has just potentially 
infected every kid. Unless you know that all of your does are healthy, pasteur-
ize milk before pooling it.
You can also try feeding kids from a shallow pan. To get the kid started, dip 
her mouth gently into the milk. She will start to drink it after she tastes it. 
This is no different than drinking water out of a bucket, which kids pick up 
very easily.
 
Whatever method you choose, make sure to rinse the buckets, bottles, nip-
ples, or other equipment with cool water and then wash and sanitize them 
after each use to prevent the kids from getting sick.
Feeding schedule
Different breeds (and sizes) of goats eat different amounts of food or milk, so 
in Table 13-1, I give you general guidelines for feeding milk or milk replacer. 
This schedule applies only to kids that are hand-fed because those that are 
dam-raised set their own schedules. Give miniature breeds about half the 
amount recommended here.

235

As you decrease the frequency and amount of milk, the kids gradually shift to 
hay and grain.
Introducing solid foods
Kids learn to eat by mimicking their mothers. Those who live with their dams 
often start nibbling on hay or straw at only a few days of age. Kids that are 
raised separately might take a little longer to figure out that hay is food.
Regardless of where they live, make sure the kids have hay at all times so 
they can eat it whenever they want. Hay helps their rumens develop.
If you feed grain to the whole herd at the same time, the kids will be intrigued 
and jump right in to find out what tastes so good. Some will catch on more 
quickly than others — these are the ones to watch for diarrhea and entero-
toxemia due to overconsumption. (See Chapter 10 for more about feed-
related diseases.)
To prevent other goats from eating the kids’ grain, you need to create a creep 
feeder — an area that the little ones can get into but the big ones can’t. You 
can make a separate area with cattle panels, which kids can squeeze through, 
or you can put a cattle panel over the front of a stall. Keep some grain in a 
bowl and try some other treats like sunflower seeds or kelp. Start very gradu-
ally with only a small handful of grain per kid each day, with a maximum of a 
pound (2 cups). 
Check the kids regularly; they’re getting too fat if you can’t feel their ribs. If 
that’s the case, you need to decrease their grain. Make sure the kids always 
have access to clean, fresh water, too.

236
Part III: Glimpsing Goat Health and Breeding 
Weaning kids
The thought of weaning kids makes me laugh because the mom and kids may 
have a different idea. If you don’t have an extra space to move the kids to, 
you may just have to give up your dream of weaning at a certain time. You 
can separate mom and kids at night so that you can milk in the morning, but 
during the day the mother-child pair can do what it wants. They usually cut 
down on the nursing substantially, but I still see them sneaking a drink from 
time to time.
In a case early on in my goat-raising days, I had a kid who tried to nurse her 
mom when the poor doe was in labor. (Someone had told me that the kidding 
doe would feel better to have a friend in the kidding pen, something I have 
generally found not to be the case.)
So, how do you wean a kid? If the kid is on a bottle, weaning is easy. Just quit 
feeding the milk. You will have to listen to some yelling from the kid for a few 
days until she realizes that crying won’t work. I usually stop bottle feeding 
gradually, cutting down to once a day for a week and then stopping alto-
gether.
In dam-raised kids, if you’re lucky the mom will decide that she’s finished 
and walk away when the kid tries to nurse. If you have a certain date in mind, 
though, you have to take things into your own hands and physically separate 
the kid. If you aren’t milking the doe, then a month is usually adequate — her 
milk dries up, and when you put the kid back in nothing is there. 
For a milker, the process can be a little more complicated. I once tried to 
wean a kid by moving her to another pen with some other kids that were also 
being weaned. They lived there for two months and then, thinking the habit 
was broken, I moved them back in with the does. Well, that little goat immedi-
ately rushed up to her mother and began nursing! 
Weaning is not always that complicated. Because I milk my goats, I start by 
locking nursing kids in a separate pen every night when they are about two 
weeks old. Then I get the morning milk. They have some grain, hay, and water 
in the pen, which helps them learn that they can get nourishment in other 
ways. 
I like to leave things to the dam-kid pair to work out how long they will nurse. 
As a result, I sometimes have a fat kid, but usually they discontinue nursing 
no later than six months.

237
 Chapter 13: Now Comes the Fun Part: Kids!
They may be cute, but you can’t keep them all 
So you got your first two does, had them bred, 
and you had two of the cutest sets of goat kids 
ever born. Now the goat area that has worked 
well for two has become home to another 
four goats that are growing before your very 
eyes. And you just love watching those little 
kids bounce around. So how are you going to 
deprive yourself?
If you’re raising goats for meat the answer is 
easy: Raise them and then sell them or butcher 
them yourself. If they’re fiber goats or dairy 
goats you may have the same solution, depend-
ing on your goals and your intestinal fortitude, 
but for a lot of people, selling those cute kids 
is hard.
Set a limit in advance of how many and what 
gender of kids you will keep. Then figure out 
where you can sell them and develop a plan for 
marketing them. (Chapter 7 gives you marketing 
ideas.)

I
f you’ve ever tasted fresh, cold goat milk, you know that the white stuff 
in stores can’t compare! You can drink goat milk raw or pasteurized, or 
you can make it into an endless variety of cheeses, yogurt, and other dairy 
products.
Goat milk is high in vitamin A, butterfat, and protein. It is more digestible 
than cow milk because the fat globules are smaller. Just about anyone you 
talk to knows of someone (usually a baby) who was “allergic” to cow milk and 
whose problem resolved when they switched to goat milk.
Getting milk from goat to table takes time and care. If you’re a novice milker, 
expect a learning curve before you and your animals are completely comfort-
able with the routine. And if you expect to supplement your income (and the 
goats’ feed) by selling milk, you might be in for a rude awakening depending 
on the laws of the state where you live.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of the laws regarding selling milk in the 
United States. I also discuss hand- and machine-milking, how to handle the 
milk, and how to make various products from the milk.
Developing a Milking Routine
Goats are creatures of habit. If you want to maximize the amount of milk you 
get and make milking easier, you need to develop a regular milking routine, 
which means using the same place and same procedure every day.

242
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
A milking routine requires you to
 
✓ Have a milking area separate from the other goats (otherwise they will 
bug you and steal grain from the goat being milked).
 
✓ Milk the goat from the same side every time.
 
✓ Wash the udder first, to encourage the udder to let down (release the 
milk) and to ensure cleanliness.
 
✓ Milk your goats in the same order each time, unless one gets mastitis 
(an inflammation of the udder, often caused by bacteria; see the upcom-
ing section “Preventing Mastitis”). You can choose any order you want, 
but I have found that the goats usually choose the order, with the herd 
queen (most dominant) going first. If you have CAEV-positive goats, milk 
them last or use separate equipment. (See Chapter 11.)
Knowing when to milk
Other than the rare precocious milker (a doe that has udder development and 
milk production without kidding), in order to freshen (produce milk) a goat 
first has to have a kid.
Before she produces true milk, a goat produces colostrum, a rich, immune-
system-boosting fluid that kids need during their first days after birth. (See 
Chapter 13 to find out more about colostrum.) The supply of milk that a goat 
produces is based on the demand for that milk. If you milk only once a day, 
you get less milk than you do with two milkings because the goat produces 
less (unless she has kids still nursing and creating demand). You can milk 
three times a day and get even more milk, but doing so is generally not cost-
effective when you consider the amount of time it takes.
Unless you’re bottle-feeding kids, let them nurse whenever they want for the 
first two weeks. Then put the kids in a separate area each night and milk their 
dams (mothers) in the morning before letting them out for the day. The kids 
keep the dams milked during the day, although you can usually get a little bit 
from an evening milking. That is, until they learn the routine and rush to their 
mothers to get that last drop before being locked up.
If you are bottle-feeding and plan to use the doe’s milk you need to start milk-
ing right after they kid. You can take their colostrum for feeding the kids or 
freeze for later use. 
 
To prepare the does for twice-daily milking, put them through the milking 
routine in the evening whether you milk them or not. That way you can gradu-
ally increase their tolerance to grain in anticipation of weaning the kids and 
milking twice a day. (To understand why you need to gradually increase their 

243
 Chapter 14: Discovering Goat Milk: How to Get, Use, and Sell It
tolerance to grain, see Chapter 10 on enterotoxemia and bloat.) Whether you 
milk once or twice a day, you need to do it at the same time to ensure that 
does don’t decrease production or get uncomfortable from a too-full udder.
Keeping the milk fresh
The axiom “You can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear” applies to goat 
milk as well: You can’t make fresh cheese out of sour milk. The best way 
to keep milk fresh is to drink it as soon as possible. But even before that, 
whether you pasteurize your milk or drink it raw, you need to start out with 
the best quality possible.
Starting with good milk
Starting with good milk means keeping it free of bad bacteria and other con-
taminants when you milk. To do this, you need to
 
✓ Make sure that the goat and her udder are clean.
 
✓ Milk in a clean environment; make sure your hands and equipment are 
clean.
 
✓ Strain the milk into a glass or stainless steel storage container right after 
milking.
 
✓ Chill the milk as soon as possible after milking to inhibit the growth of 
bacteria in the milk that contribute to spoilage. (See the upcoming sec-
tion “Cooling the milk” to find out more about chilling milk.)
 
✓ Keep the milk out of direct sunlight or fluorescent lights, which can lead 
to off-flavors and loss of nutrients.
Pasteurizing
Pasteurization is the heating of milk to destroy bacteria and other harmful 
organisms. It extends milk’s shelf life and is also the only way that you can 
make milk from a goat with a chronic disease safe for feeding to kids.
Unfortunately, pasteurization also destroys good organisms rather than just 
targeting the bad ones. And it changes the flavor of the milk, and of cheese 
made from pasteurized milk.
Like a lot of people, I prefer my goat milk raw because I know that my goats 
are healthy, I don’t use antibiotics or other drugs on my milkers, and I handle 
the milk carefully. At times I have pasteurized milk because it was a from a 
goat with CAEV but I wanted to feed it to bottle babies. (See Chapter 11 for 
more information on CAEV.) 

244
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
To pasteurize milk, follow these steps:
 
1. Put milk in a double boiler or in jars in a pasteurizer or canner and 
heat to 165° Fahrenheit for 15 seconds.
 
2. Cool the milk as quickly as possible, but make sure not to put the hot 
jars in cold water or they will break.
 
3. Store the milk in the refrigerator.
Caring for the udder
The udder is made of delicate tissue (although it doesn’t seem delicate when 
you see goat kids bashing it to let down the milk). The udder is comprised of 
two halves and is held up by ligaments in the front, back, and sides. Each half 
has a mammary gland and one teat. Most of the milk is stored in the mam-
mary gland until the udder is stimulated to let it down for kids or for you at 
milking time.
Good udder care includes these practices:
 
✓ Following a routine and properly milking the goat to avoid overfilling of 
or injury to the udder.
 
✓ Washing and drying the udder and teats before milking to minimize 
bacteria.
 
✓ Sanitizing the teats to prevent bacteria from entering the teat canal after 
milking.
 
✓ Making food available right after milking to encourage the goat to stand 
for a while after milking and allow teat canals to close.
 
✓ Promptly caring for an udder injury if it occurs. Wash a cut or scrape 
with warm, soapy water and keep an eye on any injury for complications 
such as mastitis.
Preventing mastitis
Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland. It is usually caused by 
bacteria, but also may be the result of CAEV. (See Chapter 11 for more on 
CAEV.) Mastitis is more common in older goats that have developed saggy 
udders, which are more easily injured and exposed to bacteria.
 
Keep an eye out for the signs of mastitis, which include hot, swollen udder; 
fever; loss of appetite and energy; bloody, stringy, or bad-smelling or -tasting 
milk; and hard udder. Depending on the severity, the doe may have no signs 
at all.

245
 Chapter 14: Discovering Goat Milk: How to Get, Use, and Sell It
 
You can identify and treat mastitis before it becomes severe by routinely 
using the California Mastitis Test (CMT), which is available through goat 
supply catalogs and feed stores. This simple and inexpensive test identifies 
white cells that signal infection. You just milk a few squirts from each side into 
a different section of a plastic paddle and add the CMT solution. Then you 
swirl it around and, if infection is present, the texture changes.
You can help prevent mastitis by properly milking and caring for the udder, 
regularly cleaning areas where goats spend time lying down, and not bringing 
goats with contagious diseases into the herd.
Keeping records
Tracking milk production (normally by weight) is a good way to figure out 
how much milk your goats are producing from year to year and whether their 
production is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. It also can provide 
a clue that a goat is sick, because her production goes down.
Milking records can range from informally recording milk weights on a piece 
of paper to formally enrolling in a Dairy Herd Improvement Association 
(DHIA) program and receiving monthly reports and records for each doe.
Each month participants in DHIA programs send in a sample of milk, along 
with the weight of the milk from each goat over a 24-hour period, and receive 
monthly reports that provide information on the milk, such as butterfat and 
protein percentages and somatic cell counts (a key to whether the goat has 
mastitis). 
Ending milking (Drying off)
When you are tired of milking, have to go on vacation, or a doe is three months 
into her pregnancy, you need to dry her off — that is, stop milking her. 
To dry off a doe, cut back from milking twice a day to once a day. Then stop 
milking altogether. She may be ready to stop, too — especially if it is winter 
and she has been milking for a long time. At first her udder may swell as she 
accumulates milk that is not going anywhere, so you might be tempted to 
milk out a little at a time. Don’t do it. Doing nothing protects her from masti-
tis and is the best thing to do.
If you are drying off a doe because she has mastitis, buy an intramammary 
antibiotic, such as Tomorrow, and administer it into the affected udder half 
the last day you milk. Make sure not to start milking before the withholding 
time is up.

246
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
Some treatments are for drying off and some are for does in milk, and you 
need to be careful about which one you get. If the doe has an active case of 
mastitis, you’re better off treating the mastitis before drying the doe off. If you 
dry her off while she still has active mastitis she is likely to freshen (start pro-
ducing milk the next time she has kids) with mastitis again.
One thing to consider when deciding to purchase milking does is that ideally 
you need to milk them for at least ten months out of the year. Milking ability 
is a learned trait as well as a genetic one, so if you continually dry your does 
off early, they will begin to dry themselves off even if you decide you want to 
milk them longer this time. Early drying off will decrease the amount of milk 
the doe produces every milking and over her lifetime.
Getting a Grip on Hand-Milking
Hand-milking a goat isn’t really difficult, but you do have to practice to be 
efficient and fast at it. Some goats are like cows and have teats that are large 
enough so you can use all fingers on them, while others are so small that you 
can only use three fingers.
 
Never pull on the teat. This is not how milk is extracted, and it can cause 
injury to the mammary system.
You milk a goat by using one of two methods. With either method, use your 
thumb and forefinger to form a ring around the top of the teat (which stops 
the milk from going back into the udder). In the all-fingers method, use all of 
your fingers to gently press the milk out of the teat. In the other method, gently 
squeeze with your second and third finger (or however many fingers will fit). 
Figure 14-1 shows you how to use your thumb and fingers to milk a goat.
 
To practice milking without fear of injuring the goat, use a rubber glove filled 
with water and tied shut at the top. This will give you an idea of how closing 
the teat (finger) off from the udder (hand) traps the water in the finger, allow-
ing you to “milk” the liquid out by squeezing the teat.

the milk and

Getting the supplies
You need few supplies to milk a goat. They include the following:
 
✓ Milk stand: Although people milk their goats in every situation 
imaginable — tied to the fence, on top of the dryer, in the kitchen — 
I recommend that you invest in a milk stand. A milk stand consists of 
a platform for the goat to stand on and a stanchion that latches and 
holds the goat’s head. It gets the goats off the ground, restrains them, 
and gives them a familiar place to be milked.
 
✓ Stainless steel bucket: Start with a six-quart bucket unless you are milk-
ing Nigerian Dwarves or Pygmies, which require a smaller one because 
they’re shorter.
 
✓ Udder-washing supplies: I use an old plastic coffee can with hot water 
and dish soap (you can alternatively use a dairy-specific sanitizer), rags 
made from towels cut into smaller pieces, and paper towels for drying. 
You need to wash the container after every milking and rinse with boil-
ing water or a bleach solution (one part bleach to ten parts water). Use 
the towels only once and then re-wash. As an alternative, some people 
use baby wipes.
 
✓ Teat sanitizing supplies: You need teat dip and cups (plastic containers 
that hold teat dip solution and have an opening that fits over the teat) or 
spray teat sanitizer, which you can purchase from a dairy supply com-
pany or feed store.
 
✓ Stainless steel strainer and milk filters: Milk filters are flat paper filters 
(somewhat like coffee filters) that fit into a strainer. You can buy strain-
ers and filters from a dairy supply company or feed store.
 
✓ Jars for milk storage: Half-gallon mason jars with plastic lids work great, 
because the plastic doesn’t rust when it gets wet, like metal does.
Running through the hand-milking process
To hand-milk a goat, follow these steps:
 
1. Get the goat onto the milk stand and secure her in the stanchion with 
some grain for her to eat.
 
2. Wash your hands.
 
3. Clean the udder and teats with warm water and soap or sanitize with 
a wipe such as Milk Check Teat Wipes and dry them with a clean 
paper towel. 
 
 Make sure to thoroughly dry your hands.

248
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
4. Wrap your fingers and thumb around each teat to trap some milk 
in the teat (see Figure 14-1) and squeeze to quickly milk one or two 
squirts from each teat into a cup. 
 
 This step allows you to check for abnormalities and removes any milk 
close to the surface of the teat that is more likely to be contaminated 
with bacteria. If the milk is abnormal, dispose of it after milking. (See 
Care of the udder in the Section “Caring for the Udder”.)
 
5. Promptly milk the goat into a sanitized bucket, being careful not to 
pull on the teats.
 
 The less time you spend between washing and milking, the higher the 
milk yield. If you take too long to milk, don’t be surprised if the goat 
starts dancing or causing other mischief if she runs out of grain. You will 
have give her seconds, making an effort not to overfeed her until she is 
used to larger portions.
 
6. When you think the udder is empty, massage the back and bottom 
of the udder and bump it gently with your fist (more gently than the 
babies do!) in the front near the teats to encourage further let-down.
 
7. Pour the milk through a clean, filtered strainer into a clean jar.
 
8. Dip or spray the teats with a sanitizer such as Derma Sept Teat Dip. 
 
 If you use dip cups, use a clean one for each goat to avoid 
cross-contamination.
 
9. Return the goat to the herd.
 
 Make sure you have some fresh hay or alfalfa and fresh water available 
for the goat right after milking. She will eat and drink instead of lying 
down and expose an open teat orifice to bacteria. The orifice gradually 
seals, protecting the goat from mastitis.
 
10. Clean the bucket and strainer.
 
 Rinse the bucket and strainer with tepid water right away. Wash with 
warm soapy water and rinse with boiling water or a solution of one part 
bleach to 10 parts water and air dry. To remove milk stone buildup (resi-
due caused by minerals in milk), use a solution of half white vinegar and 
half warm water.
You are likely to encounter problems with milking from time to time, espe-
cially if you are new to milking. Be aware that the first few days after fresh-
ening, your goat’s milk will still have colostrum in it, which can affect the 
quality. Table 14-1 describes some other problems that you may encounter 
and how to solve them.

249

Table 14-1 
Solving Common Milking Problems
Problem
Solution
Blood in milk
Do CMT (see the section “Preventing mastitis”). If first 
freshener, it may be a broken blood vessel. Continue 
milking and discard milk. Wait to see whether is disap-
pears within a few days.
Problem with letdown
Let kid nurse first. (More common in first fresheners and 
goats that are nursing kids)
Off-flavor milk
Perform CMT. If negative consider illness, odor (bucks), 
or recent food consumed (onions, garlic).
Using a hand-milking machine
 
Goat milkers who have developed pain and other problems with their hands 
may want to try a hand-milking machine such as the Udderly EZ Milker (www.
udderlyezllc.com) or the Maggidans Milker (www.maggidans.com). 
Originally invented to extract colostrum from mares after foaling, these hand-
pump machines have been modified for milking goats.
The hand-milking machines consist of a simple hand vacuum pump, a silicon 
insert, tubing, and a collection jar. You attach the insert to one teat at a time, 
pump to get a vacuum, and then milk then goes down the tube to a collection 
jar. The machines eliminate the need for straining the milk and are said to be 
much easier on your hands.
To clean a hand-milking machine, just rinse the tubing with tepid water right 
away. Wash the machine and tubing with warm soapy water and rinse with 
boiling water or a solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water and air dry. 
To remove milk stone buildup (residue caused by minerals in milk), soak in a 
solution of half white vinegar and half warm water.
Using a Motorized Milking Machine
If you don’t think your hands are strong enough to hand milk, you have a 
problem such as carpal tunnel, or milking your goats by hand just takes too 
long, consider getting a milking machine. Figure 14-2 shows you a bucket milk 
machine, which is the type that small-scale dairy goat farms use, rather than 
one with a direct line into a bulk milk tank.

250

Figure 14-2:

if you don’t

A milking machine is a combination of several components that work 
together to create a vacuum that draws milk from the teats, alternating with 
air, which causes the milk to flow into a container in a rhythmic fashion, simi-
lar to a kid nursing.
New ones are pretty expensive, but you can sometimes find a used one on 
eBay or craigslist for a reasonable price. I thought I wanted one and got a 
reconditioned model. After two uses, I decided it was too loud and too much 
hassle to clean, and so I went back to hand-milking. 
Like any skill, machine-milking takes practice. Try to find other goat owners 
who machine-milk so you can get an idea of what to expect from a milk 
machine and what using one entails.
Here are the steps for milking a goat with a milking machine:
 
1. Sanitize the milking machine with a sanitizer such as Clorox.
 
2. Turn the milking machine on and check that a vacuum is being cre-
ated in each attachment before attaching the inflations to the doe.
 
 Improper vacuum attachment can lead to mastitis. To check whether it 
is working effectively, listen to the machine for a hissing noise with the 

251
 Chapter 14: Discovering Goat Milk: How to Get, Use, and Sell It
cluster vacuum shut off. If it is working properly, the hissing noise will 
decrease.
 
3. Get the goat onto the milk stand and secure her in the stanchion with 
some grain for her to eat.
 
4. Wash your hands.
 
5. Hand-milk one or two squirts from each teat into a cup.
 
 This allows you to check for abnormalities and removes any milk close 
to the surface of the teat that is more likely to be contaminated with bac-
teria. If the milk is abnormal, dispose of it after milking.
 
6. Clean the udder and teats with warm water and soap, or sanitize with 
a wipe such as Milk Check Teat Wipes.
 
7. Thoroughly dry the udder and teats with a clean paper towel.
 
 Never milk a wet udder because doing so can irritate the teats and lead 
to mastitis.
 
8. Place the teat cups of the machine on the goat’s udder and then turn 
the vacuum on.
 
 When the vacuum reaches the proper setting the teat cups stay on the 
goat. You see milk begin to flow through the tubing to the container.
 
9. Remove the machine when you can no longer see a large volume of 
milk going through the tubing.
 
 Make sure you keep an eye on the quantity. Over-milking can cause 
mastitis in machine-milked goats. The udder should shrink as you milk 
it, except during the first few days after kidding, when it may be swollen 
from the hormones released for kidding.
 
10. Hand-milk the last bit of milk to prevent disease and decreased milk 
production.
 
 Milking the last bit of milk is called stripping.
 
11. Dip or spray the teats with a sanitizer such as Derma Sept Teat Dip.
 
 If you use dip cups, use a clean one for each goat to avoid cross-
contamination. If you spray the teats, make sure to thoroughly coat 
each teat end with spray.
 
12. Return the goat to the herd.
 
 Make sure you have some fresh hay or alfalfa and fresh water available 
for the goat right after milking. She will eat and drink instead of lying 
down and expose an open teat orifice to bacteria. The orifice gradually 
seals, protecting the goat from mastitis.
 
13. Clean the milking machine according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Handling Milk to Keep 
It Clean and Fresh
After you milk your goats, you need to take a few steps to ensure that your 
milk is clean, that bacteria growth is minimized, and that the milk stays fresh 
as long as possible. In this section I tell you how to strain, cool, and store 
fresh goat milk.
Straining the milk
Whether you are milking by hand or by machine, you need to immediately 
strain the milk before you use it (unless you will be using it right away to 
make cheese or another dairy product that requires heating). Straining the 
milk removes hair, hay pieces, or any other foreign object that may inad-
vertently get into the milk when you’re milking. Straining also gives you the 
opportunity to take a second look at the milk, in case you couldn’t see an 
abnormality in the initial squirts. (See the sections “Milking By Hand” and 
“Using a Motorized Milking Machine.”)
To strain your milk you need a strainer with a milk filter, which you can find 
in feed stores or goat supply catalogs. If you don’t have a lot of milk — say, a 
few gallons — a mini stainless steel strainer will do nicely. I buy the large milk 
filters and cut them to fit in the mini strainer rather than buying the hard-to-
find and more expensive mini milk filters. The mini strainer sits on the top of 
a half gallon canning jar for straining and immediate cooling.
Cooling the milk
To retain the milk’s flavor and minimize the growth of bacteria, you need 
to cool milk quickly. If you have a timer (or a better memory than I do) you 
can put the milk in the freezer and then take it out before it’s frozen. If not, 
then go to your favorite camping supply department and get some of those 
little plastic liquid-filled ice cubes that can be re-frozen, put your jar of milk 
in a bucket or other container, surround it with ice cubes and put the whole 
works in the refrigerator until it is chilled. Then take out the ice cubes, re-
freeze, and use them after the next milking.
Storing the milk
The easiest way to store milk is in the refrigerator at 40° Fahrenheit or lower. 
I use half-gallon jars with plastic lids. If promptly chilled and stored at the 

253
 Chapter 14: Discovering Goat Milk: How to Get, Use, and Sell It
right temperature, goat milk will last five days or more before it begins to 
develop a “goaty” taste (you know what I’m talking about when you taste it!) 
or starts turning sour.
 
If your milk starts to go bad, feed it to chickens, pigs, or dogs — they love it.
Other ways to store milk require some chemistry — you can ferment it by 
making yogurt or kefir, or you can turn it into cheese. The appendix gives you 
some recipes, and you can find many more on the Internet or in one of the 
many books on cheesemaking.
Staying Legal While Selling Milk
 
In 1924, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) developed a model 
law called the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) to stop milkborne illness. 
The intent of the law was to require that only Grade “A” pasteurized milk 
could be sold to consumers and businesses. So far, all but four states have 
passed the law or a modified version of it.
Although selling anything other than Grade “A” pasteurized milk is illegal in 
46 states, farmers can still sell raw milk legally in 32 states. The states that 
have legalized the sale of milk that’s not from a grade A dairy or pasteurized 
have done so by passing additional laws or administrative rules.
In other cases, small milk producers have gone around the law by selling 
shares in their animals, and some state regulators have chosen not to inter-
vene. The share plan, which has been adopted by some people with cows, 
is like the community supported agriculture (CSA) model, in which people 
invest in (buy a share of) a farm and get vegetables and fruits throughout the 
season — only in this case they get milk.
Even if you can’t sell milk for human consumption, you may be able to sell 
it to people for their pigs, dogs, or orphaned animals. In every state but 
Michigan, goat owners can legally sell raw milk for animal consumption.
Legally selling milk products such as yogurt or cheese without being licensed 
as a dairy is another story. Most states prohibit sales of these items by small, 
unlicensed farmers, although in some states the authorities’ policy is not to 
actively seek out people who are selling these products outside of the law.
 
If you plan to sell your milk or milk products on a small scale, first find out 
what hoops you need to jump through. You can find individual state laws 
and regulations regarding the sale of milk at www.realmilk.com/milk-
laws-1.html.

Goat Meat: From Breeding to 
Selling and Beyond
In This Chapter
▶ Making your own meat breeds
▶ Understanding the meat goat market
▶ Using other parts of the goat
▶ Finding out where to market your goats
P
eople around the world have used goat meat as a staple in their diet 
for centuries. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, goats 
produce very lean meat. It has 25 percent fewer calories than chicken and 
one-third as much fat as beef.
Meat from mature goats is called chevon, and meat from kids is sometimes 
referred to as cabrito. Whatever you call it, it’s a tasty alternative to other 
meats, something that more people are learning every day, as goat meat 
gradually catches on in the United States.
 
If you want to make money raising goats, raising them for meat is an efficient 
way to do so. Demand keeps growing, but most goat meat is still imported to 
the United States from New Zealand; small-scale meat goat farmers can help 
meet the need.
In this chapter I tell you about some of the important considerations for 
selling goats for meat.

256
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Getting the Basics of Raising 
Goats for Meat
Any goat meat is good for eating. You may eat goat meat as a way to deal 
with excess wethers or get food from a predominantly milk or fiber herd, but 
if you’re raising goats for income from meat production, you want goats that 
are solid, well-muscled, and bred for meat. The most common meat goats are
 
✓ Boers
 
✓ Kikos
 
✓ Kinders
 
✓ Myotonic, or fainting goats
 
✓ Spanish, or feral goats
Breeders are cross-breeding some of these goats to each other in hopes of 
producing a better meat goat. Two of these crosses include the TexMaster — 
a cross between the Myotonic and the Boer developed at Onion Creek Ranch 
in Tennessee and the Moneymaker — a cross of Saanen, Nubian, and Boer 
created on the Copeland family farms in California. (Chapter 3 runs through 
goat breeds.)
Because meat goats are still relatively new to the United States market, 
there’s still a lot of room for cross-breeding in a quest to find the ideal. 
Before you decide on a breed, look around to see what’s happening in your 
part of the country and think about whether you might want to work with 
more than one breed.
Cross-breeding standard dairy 
goats to produce meat goats
Most people don’t milk their goats for years at a stretch. Instead, they breed 
them every year and give them a two-month break from milking. (The end of 
a pregnancy is hard enough on a doe without taxing her further by milking.) 
This schedule can easily triple a herd in one short year. Smart breeders keep 
only the best bucks for breeding. The market for pack wethers is limited, and 
standard-sized dairy goat wethers and does are less likely to be in demand as 
pets when people can get cute Nigerians or Pygmies. You have to sell a lot of 
kids if you raise dairy goats, and you may have a tough time finding buyers.

257
 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
One solution to this problem is to cross-breed your standard dairy goats with 
a meat goat, such as a Boer. The offspring of Boer goats crossed with Nubian, 
Alpine, or another dairy breed grow faster than the dairy breeds and appeal 
to people who want to buy goats for meat. Nubian and Alpine crossbreeds 
are the most popular in the market. If you want a smaller meat goat, you can 
buy or make a Kinder goat by crossing a Pygmy and a Nubian to create a 
miniature dual meat and milk goat.
Using crossbreeds also has the advantage of being less expensive for another 
reason: Purebred meat goats can be expensive, in some cases requiring that 
they be shipped from a long distance. If you breed crosses instead of purebreds 
you just have to get one buck with good genetics and use him on any number 
of does.
Using your dairy goats for meat
An alternative to using purebred or crossbred meat goats is to use excess 
dairy goats for meat. Particularly if you have a large goat such as the Nubian, 
you can produce animals that provide meat for sale or for your own use.
Some people don’t like taking their kids to the auction to sell them because 
they consider the treatment they get there inhumane. Instead they slaughter 
the goats themselves and put them in the freezer. Kids make very tender 
meat, while cull does (does that you sell because they don’t fit with your 
breeding program) are less tender and can be used for ground goat or sausage.
Selling Your Products
Demand for goat meat in the United States is rising, but more than half the 
goat meat consumed here comes from New Zealand and Australia. Plenty of 
room for a local market! This section gives you the information you need to 
start filling that gap by selling your own goat meat.
Identifying potential buyers
Start your goat-meat enterprise by finding out who your buyers might be. 
Demand exists for meat goats, as well as for goat meat.

258
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
You can make more money selling meat goats with good genetics behind 
them than you can selling meat. Those likely to be interested in buying meat 
goats include the following:
  
✓ People interested in showing goats: Children in 4-H or Future Farmers 
of America can raise a meat goat as a project, show him at the county 
fair, and then sell him to the highest bidder. Both adults and children 
buy goats for shows sanctioned by meat goat registries, such as the 
American Boer Goat Association (ABGA) or the American Meat Goat 
Association (AMGA). In some cases you can show market wethers that 
aren’t even purebred.
 
✓ Owners of acreage: Goats are now recognized as superior to using 
herbicides to control noxious weeds. Because meat goats are big (in 
relation to other goats) they can more efficiently browse large areas, 
helping with weed control.
 
✓ Goat packers: Meat goat or meat-goat-cross wethers are becoming more 
popular for use as pack animals because they’re large and strong.
 
✓ Other breeders: If you have some good purebreds or a new meat breed 
that you’re developing, you can sell those goats to others who want to 
get into the business or improve their herd.
 
You get the best prices when you sell goats that weigh 40 to 60 pounds. The 
prices continue to go down as the goats become heavier, with those that 
weigh from 80 to 100 pounds bringing the lowest price. If you have to sell your 
heavier goats, do so when no lighter goats are available.
Selling goat meat rather than selling those goats on the hoof (alive) gives 
you the advantage of being able to ensure that they are treated kindly and 
slaughtered humanely. On the other hand, it also requires more work on 
your part — whether you are coordinating all the necessary steps or getting 
qualified as a slaughter facility. You also may have a harder time finding 
customers, but after you do, if you can supply them with the quantity and 
quality of meat they want, you’re in business.
Try the following avenues for finding buyers for your goat meat:
 
✓ Local restaurants: Restaurants that serve people from an ethnic group 
in which goat meat is a staple or people who are interested in less 
common foods may want goat meat for their menus.
 
✓ Prisons: Prisons sometimes buy meat from cull goats at discounted 
prices, ensuring that you can sell meat even from your less desirable 
animals.
 
✓ Farmers’ markets: Farmers’ markets are springing up in many 
communities and draw a wealth of customers hungry for organic 
produce, raw milk and cheeses, and meat from animals that were fed 
and treated well.

259
 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
 
 Farmers’ markets can be a particularly good place to sell goat meat — if 
you live near people who traditionally eat goat meat and the local laws 
don’t prohibit its sale. But people who have traveled and tried goat meat 
in another country or have heard about it and just want to try something 
new are also potential customers.
 
 Be enthusiastic about your product. If you can, give out samples to show 
people how good goat meat really tastes. Provide recipes, information 
on nutritional value, and cooking tips.
 
 The downside to farmers’ markets is that they’re time-consuming — you 
have to travel, set up and break down your vendor booth, and stay put 
to sell your product. (Unless, of course, you want to hire someone else 
to do the work.) On the other hand, they give you a chance to get away 
from the farm and interact with people.
 
✓ People in ethnic communities: People from Middle Eastern, Indian, 
Hispanic, and African origin regularly eat goat meat and are often 
interested in buying one or two goats at a time for a celebration. 
(Table 15-1 lists holidays when goat meat is commonly eaten.) 
 
 A study in 2005 by the Northwest Cooperative Development Association 
in Washington, showed that almost three quarters of people who eat 
goat meat do so for cultural, traditional, or religious reasons.

Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
To maximize your income you need to time your goat sales to make the most 
from the market. You can get the highest prices around Thanksgiving and 
Easter and generally in the fall. Demand is highest at these times because of 
the celebrations when people are more likely to eat goat meat. Summer is not 
a good time to sell your goats.
Selling goats
If you are directly selling your goats to a buyer for meat you have several 
options, you can see the whole animal (privately or at an auction) and leave 
slaughtering up to the customer, or you can have it slaughtered by a mobile 
butcher or licensed slaughterhouse. Unless you are licensed as a slaughter 
plant, you can’t do the slaughtering.
Selling a goat for a customer to take home to slaughter
The easiest transaction is selling a goat to a customer to take home to 
slaughter. When a customer comes to a farm to buy a goat, make sure you 
have separated those goats that are for sale from the ones that aren’t, so that 
you don’t have customers trying to talk you into selling a goat that you don’t 
want to sell.
You need to agree on a price for the goat in advance, unless you want to 
bargain with a customer. If you price the goat by the pound, make sure you 
have a scale so that you can weigh the goat in the presence of the customer.
Then make the transaction, write a receipt for the purchase, load the goat 
in the customer’s vehicle, and you’re done. If you have concerns about the 
goat’s welfare, talk to the customer about care long before you allow him 
to take the goat, and do not allow him to transport the goat in an inhumane 
manner — for example, in the trunk of a car.
Letting a customer slaughter on your farm
One way to make sure your goats are slaughtered humanely is to let customers 
butcher the goats they buy on your farm. If you decide to go with this option, 
remember that the law prohibits you from helping or participating. (See 
“Legal considerations” later in this chapter.) Before you allow customers to 
slaughter a goat on your property
 
✓ Consider the impact of having strangers come to your farm. They can 
bring diseases with them, particularly if they have other livestock, and 
they might run around into places you’d rather they didn’t.
 
✓ Evaluate your legal liability. The section “Legal considerations” runs 
through important points you need to think about before you let anyone 
slaughter an animal on your property.

261
 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
 
✓ Make sure that they are experienced and know what they’re doing. Ask 
whether they have slaughtered a goat before and how they usually do it.
 
✓ Clarify that they must humanely slaughter the goat.
 
✓ If you haven’t picked out a specific goat, separate the goats you’re 
selling from the others to prevent last-minute bartering over a goat you 
don’t intend to sell.
 
✓ If you have a livestock guardian dog or other farm dog, make sure that 
it’s restrained or locked up.
Find out in advance who will be coming to slaughter the goat. A friend of 
mine had some buyers come out to her farm every year and slaughter a goat 
for a celebration. In previous years just men had come, but one year they 
brought children to watch, which made her uncomfortable.
 
If you allow others to slaughter your goats on your farm, provide them a place 
away from your other goats to avoid traumatizing the goats. Be clear about 
who will deal with cleanup and any waste products, such as internal organs, 
and make sure you know your state law regarding such disposal.
You may need to provide the following:
 
✓ A place to hang the carcass to drain the blood
 
✓ Sanitized table for cutting up the carcass
 
✓ Fire pit or blow torch for searing hair
 
✓ Very sharp knife
 
✓ Hose for rinsing blood or washing internal organs
 
✓ Shelter from inclement weather
Hiring a mobile butcher or going to a slaughterhouse
You can have a customer come to your farm to pick out a goat that you 
then have slaughtered. After the customer selects his goat and pays you for 
it, you call a mobile butcher or take the goat to an agreed-upon slaughter 
facility. This method ensures that the goat is slaughtered according to 
accepted methods and nothing goes wrong because professionals are 
doing it.
You can have the customer pay you for the goat and the cost of slaughter 
and the butcher for the cost of cutting and wrapping at the time he picks up 
the meat. (For more on mobile slaughter and taking a goat to a slaughterhouse, 
see below.)

262
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Livestock auctions
Selling goats at a livestock auction is easy, but you won’t get the best prices 
there, and the auction gets a fee from your earnings (usually a percentage 
of the sale). Prices fluctuate, as well, so if you decide to take your goats, do 
so when the auction has a specific day for selling goats, or one or two weeks 
before a major celebration. (Table 15-1 shows you times of celebrations.)
 
A side benefit to auctions is that you can also meet people who are interested 
in buying directly from you in the future. Make sure you have business cards 
ready to hand out.
Advertising
Marketing your meat goats is like marketing anything else. You need to keep 
at it and you need to advertise in a variety of venues in hopes of finding the 
one that pays off.
You’ll find lots of advertising opportunities for meat goats. Some of these 
include:
 
✓ Classified ads: Breed-specific journals and thrifties usually provide 
classifieds for a small fee.
 
✓ Goat shows: Exhibiting at shows enables you to market to other goat 
producers and interested parties watching the show. You can also find 
out about market opportunities by talking to others who are showing 
their goats.
 
✓ Bulletin boards: If you live near a city with a large ethnic community 
that traditionally eats goat meat, advertise on bulletin boards in stores 
or other businesses that serve that community.
 
 After you sell a goat or two to families in the community, you may find 
that customers come to you through word of mouth. I don’t even raise 
meat goats but am asked by acquaintances from time to time about 
selling goats for celebrations.
 
✓ Feature articles: Consider writing an article about your farm or asking 
the local agriculture paper to feature your farm. 
 
✓ Television news: Find a reason to have the local television station 
feature your goats and business on the news. Newscasters regularly do 
animal features because they know that viewers love them. When one of 
my goats had quintuplets I notified both print and television media, who 
were happy to come out.
 
✓ The Internet: Craigslist, Yahoo discussion groups, and various 
agricultural sites provide a venue for advertising goats for sale.

✓ Business cards: Make sure you have plenty of business cards; always 
carry some with you and leave them in stores, auction bulletin boards, 
and other businesses where interested people can take one. You 
never know when you might be chatting with someone in a store who 
expresses interest in purchasing goats or goat meat.
Legal considerations
You need to be aware of certain legal issues relating to selling meat goats and 
allowing related activities on your farm:
 
✓ Illegal drug residues: You need to know the meat withdrawal times — 
the length of time during which a drug can be found in meat after you 
give it to a goat. Under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policy, 
you’re liable for any illegal drug residues found in your goat products. 
Ask your veterinarian about the meat withdrawal time for any drug he 
prescribes or that you give to your goat.
 
✓ Slaughter regulations: Under USDA requirements you can slaughter 
your goats and sell the meat only if you are licensed as a slaughter plant. 
If you aren’t licensed, you can use meat that you slaughter only for home 
consumption or give it away.
 
✓ Landowner liability: If someone gets hurt while on your property with 
your permission and you are benefitting from them being there, you may 
be liable. Liability is a concern if you allow a visitor to slaughter a goat 
that she’s buying from you and something goes wrong.
 
 Make sure you’re covered. Talk to your insurance agent about liability 
insurance that would apply to an accident that came about from a goat 
sale and slaughter.
 
✓ Rental or lease agreement: If you rent or lease your farm property, read 
your lease carefully to make sure you aren’t violating any provisions by 
having other individuals slaughter goats on your farm.
Determining what to charge
The market depends on whether you are selling goats on the hoof or goat 
meat, as well as a lot of factors outside your control, from the number of 
people in your area who are selling goats to the popularity of goat and goat 
meat in your community. To find out what people are getting for live goats:
 
✓ Ask other breeders what they charge.
 
✓ Go to a livestock auction where goats are being sold and see what kinds 
of prices they bring.

264
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
✓ Talk to your local slaughterhouse. Ask the local butcher whether they 
buy goats or can refer you to other meat goat sellers.
 
✓ Contact a local broker or cooperative. You can find a broker or 
cooperative that buys meat goats through your meat goat association.
 
✓ Price goat meat that is being sold in farmers’ markets or specialty 
stores.
 
If you’re selling meat to a customer, you need a licensed butcher. Normally 
customers agree to purchase a goat at a specified price per pound hanging 
weight. You need to make sure they understand that the hanging weight is 
more than the weight of actual meat they will receive. You also need to be 
clear on who will pay for what and make sure they talk to the butcher about 
what cuts of meat they want. The butcher can let them know their options.
Using marketing terminology properly
If you plan to sell your goat meat, make sure that you use the appropriate 
terminology and don’t mislead customers with untrue claims. Here’s a 
rundown of important terms:
 
✓ Organically certified refers to meat from a goat that was raised 
according to the National Organic Program standards and certified 
by an accredited state or private agency. Among those standards are 
dictates that 
 
• You do not use any dewormers or antibiotics in the goat and in its 
dam during the last third of pregnancy or lactation. 
 
• Feed and bedding must be from certified organic sources.
 
• You may vaccinate your goats.
 
✓ Natural means that the goat meat is minimally processed using no 
artificial ingredients, coloring agents, or chemicals. The raw product 
isn’t fundamentally changed.
 
✓ Humanely raised and handled meat is a newer category relating to 
animal welfare. It means the goats are from a farm that is enrolled in 
a private certification program such as Humane Farm Animal Care 
(www.certifiedhumane.com). Currently, such certification programs 
have no standards for goats.
 
Grass fed does not presently have a regulated meaning for marketing, but that 
may change in time.

 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
Slaughtering Goats
If you plan to eat your own goat meat or sell it to other people, you have to 
figure out how you want to get the goat slaughtered. You can butcher your 
own goats for your meat supply, but you can’t legally slaughter goats for 
customers, unless your operation is licensed as a slaughter plant. 
If you plan to use your meat only for home consumption or to give to 
friends, doing it yourself is an inexpensive option. (See the section “Legal 
considerations.”)
In this section I talk about your options for how to get your goats slaughtered 
and give you the pros and cons of each of them.
Doing it yourself
If you’re a do-it-yourself person or a hunter who’s used to butchering animals, 
you probably want to slaughter your own goats for a family meat supply. 
In addition to being less expensive, doing it yourself is easier on the goats 
because they don’t have to deal with strangers or be hauled off to an 
unknown place and handled by people they don’t know.
If you want to slaughter your own goats, talk to other people who raise 
and slaughter their own meat goats or contact your local county extension 
office for information. You can also find instructions and even videos on the 
Internet. The upcoming section “Humanely slaughtering goats” gives you 
pointers on the best way to do your own slaughter.
Using a licensed slaughter plant
If you’re too squeamish to slaughter your own goats or just don’t have the 
time or experience, you can hire a professional to do it. In some areas you 
can find a licensed mobile slaughter company to come to your farm, but 
more commonly you take the goats to a licensed slaughter plant.
One disadvantage of using a slaughter plant is that you lose control of how 
the goat is slaughtered. If you hire a mobile butcher, you will at least be there 
to supervise. But if you take your animal to a slaughter plant or just take him 
to an auction, you will have no idea whether he is being humanely handled 
and slaughtered.

266
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
You can find a licensed slaughter plant by looking in the phone book or 
asking other farmers or the local feed store who is available and who does 
a good job. At certain times of the year, such as in the fall, you may have 
difficulty getting an appointment because they are busy. In addition, you may 
also have difficulty finding a plant that slaughters goats, depending on where 
you live.
Hiring a mobile butcher
The next best option to having your goats slaughtered on your farm is to hire 
a mobile butcher. Mobile butchers are licensed to come to your farm and 
slaughter your animals and then take them to a butcher shop for cutting and 
wrapping. They aren’t available in every area.
I hired a mobile butcher for a pig I raised. It’s better for your animals because 
they don’t get stressed out by being loaded up and driven to a strange place. 
Instead, they can stay home, where they are comfortable and won’t get 
frightened.
A mobile slaughterer has a specially designed truck where he hangs the goat 
carcass to remove the blood. He takes all of the internal organs and waste, 
so you have no clean-up afterward. If you have more than one goat that you 
want slaughtered, you save money by having all of them slaughtered at once.
After slaughter, the mobile slaughterer takes your goat carcasses to the 
shop to cut and wrap the meat. You just pick up your packages and pay the 
butcher.
Humanely slaughtering goats
Muslims and Jews have age-old traditions for slaughtering goats and other 
animals. Both religions require that the animals not be made to suffer. 
Currently accepted standards for humane slaughter emanate from these 
traditions as well as an ethic of kindness. Here are some tips for humane 
slaughter:
 
✓ If a goat is being slaughtered at your farm, make sure that he is away 
from the other animals, so that you minimize the trauma to the others.
 
✓ Keep the environment quiet and calm.
 
✓ If you have more than one goat to go to the butcher, send them together 
so they will have the comfort of their herd for the trip.

267
 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
 
✓ Make the transport environment as comfortable as possible to avoid 
stressing them.
 
✓ Use a knife whose blade is twice as long as the width of the goat’s neck 
to prevent pain during the cut.
 
✓ Don’t unnecessarily bend your goat’s neck when cutting the throat.
 
✓ If you are artificially restraining the goat, make one smooth cut within 30 
seconds of restraint.
Using All of the Goat
If you are particularly practical or environmentally conscious, you probably 
want to use parts of the goat that are left after the rest of it is turned into 
meat. In this section I talk about three possible uses.
Hide tanning
After you’ve skinned a goat, throwing that lovely hide into the compost or 
garbage seems like a shame. You can make a pillow, a rug, a wine bag, a 
drum, or even an article of clothing from a goat skin. I remember a man who 
proudly wore his goat skin vest to our annual goat conference.
 
Tanning a hide isn’t very hard, but it takes some time. For best results use a 
fresh goat skin, rather than one that has been salted or stored in the freezer.
You need the following supplies to tan a goat hide with the hair attached:
 
✓ Water
 
✓ Laundry detergent
 
✓ Bleach
 
✓ Pickling solution
 
✓ Large plastic or glass container (a plastic garbage can will work)
 
✓ Nails and hammer
 
✓ Coarse sandpaper
 
✓ Large stick or baseball bat

268
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Preparing a pickling solution
Before you get ready to tan the hide, make a pickling solution. You can use 
this four or five times as long as you have a place to store it.
 
1. Boil five gallons of water and pour into a plastic (nonreactive) container.
 
2. Add 21⁄2 pounds of alum (ammonium aluminum sulfate or potassium 
aluminum sulfate).
 
 You can find alum at a local pharmacy, farm supply store, or through a 
taxidermy supply catalog. 
 
3. Add 15 pounds of rock salt, stirring until dissolved.
 
4. Cool the solution or store for later use.
Tanning the hide
To tan a hide, follow these steps:
 
1.  Scrape all leftover fat or meat off the hide while it’s fresh.
 
 Place the hide on a smooth board with the fur side down, and use the 
back edge of a knife, held almost flat, to remove the scraps. (This is 
called scudding.) 
 
2. Hand wash the hide in warm water with laundry detergent and some 
bleach.
 
3. Rinse the hide with clear, cold water, making sure to get all the soap 
and oil off. 
 
4. Put the hide in your pickling solution so it’s completely immersed and 
doesn’t have any air pockets.
 
5. Let it soak for two to three weeks, stirring the hide in the mixture 
once or twice per day.
 
 Two weeks’ soaking time is adequate for hides from young goats. 
Overtanning is unlikely with this method, so it’s better to oversoak than 
undersoak.
 
6. When it’s done soaking, remove the hide from the pickling solution 
and repeat Steps 2 and 3 to remove all of the salt.
 
7. Carefully stretch the hide and attach to the wall (or a frame, if you 
have one) with small nails so that the hair side faces the wall.
 
 Make sure that you hang it in an area away from sunlight. A garage or 
barn wall works well. Let the hide dry for four to five days.
 
8. Soften the dry hide by rubbing the non-hair side with coarse sandpaper 
and then folding the hide, non-hair side out, and beating it with a bat 
or heavy stick.
 
 Refold the hide periodically to ensure that you beat all of the hide to 
soften it.

269
 Chapter 15: Goat Meat: From Breeding to Selling and Beyond
Animal feed
Many veterinarians recommend the BARF (bones and raw food) diet for dogs. 
When you slaughter your own goats you can give your dogs the organ meat, 
bones, and other parts of the goat that you aren’t going to use. And it’s 
basically free.
Just separate out the parts that you don’t plan to use, package them in 
plastic bags, or use them with other meat, vegetables, and supplements to 
make dog food, and freeze until you’re ready to use. This lets you provide 
bones and meat for your dogs little by little.
Using the organs for herd health check
 
Sometimes goat herds develop nutritional deficiencies that can’t be diagnosed 
on a live animal. (See Chapter 11 on nutritional deficiencies.) An example 
of this is copper deficiency. The only way you can tell if your goat herd has 
copper deficiency or another mineral deficiency is by analyzing the liver. And 
you can’t have the liver analyzed while the animal is still alive.
When you butcher a goat, you have the perfect opportunity to send a liver to 
the lab for a trace nutrient mineral test. Whether you learn that the goat had 
a mineral deficiency or perfect lab values for minerals, you receive valuable 
information regarding your feeding program. (See sidebar for more on a trace 
nutrient mineral test.)
You can also check the goat’s stomach or intestines for internal parasites, 
the liver for liver flukes, or other organs for abnormalities, depending on 
your level of expertise in evaluating these problems.
Running a trace nutrient mineral test
The trace nutrient mineral test is used to 
diagnose mineral nutritional status in a goat. 
Liver is the preferred specimen for this test. It 
should be kept frozen or refrigerated after you 
obtain the sample and during shipping.
This test determines whether the goat had a 
deficiency or an excess level of the minerals 
cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, 
selenium, and zinc.

Fiber, Breeding, Weed

In This Chapter
▶ Learning about goat fiber and its uses
▶ Showing your goats
▶ Creating miniature breeds
▶ Putting your bucks to work
G
oats offer so many opportunities to enrich your life and produce addi-
tional income, products, and satisfaction. Besides using them for milk 
and meat, or for pets, you can raise them to produce fiber for sale or for your 
own use. And regardless of what kind of goats you choose, you can involve 
them in different hobbies and recreational activities — such as showing, cre-
ating a new breed, or just hanging out to relieve stress.
In this chapter I tell you about raising goats for fiber production, what fibers 
different goats produce, and how to make goat-hair fiber into yarn that you 
can knit with or take to market. I also talk about some basics of showing your 
goat and how to prepare for showing. I tell you about caring for the up-and-
coming mini dairy goats and about some of the other ways that your goat 
herd can pay its way or help you enjoy life more.
Harvesting and Selling Fiber
Humans have kept goats and used the fiber they produce for millennia. You 
find goat fiber in clothing and in fabrics for furniture upholstery, drapes, 
rugs, and even wigs. Cashmere sweaters, made from the undercoat of cer-
tain kinds of goats, are highly prized. And they should be: just one cashmere 
sweater requires a year’s worth of growth from three to four goats.

272
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Depending on the goats you choose and the type of fiber they produce, you 
can harvest fiber by shearing or by hand-pulling. Then you have to clean it, 
separate it, and go through a few other steps to get in shape for spinning.
Many people who raise small herds of goats for their fiber handle all these 
steps themselves, and they form communities so that they can get together 
or share their knowledge with each other. 
In this section I talk about the different kinds of fiber goats produce and how 
to harvest it, process it, use it for your own projects, or sell it.
Reviewing fiber types
Different goats produce different types of fiber, some more valuable than 
others. The three most common types of goat fiber are the following:
 
✓ Mohair: Angora goats produce brown, black, red, and white fiber called 
mohair. (Angora fiber is produced by rabbits.) Their fleece grows about 
an inch each month, and you need to shear them twice a year, usually in 
the spring and fall. You can expect to get an average of 5 to 10 pounds of 
mohair from each shearing.
 
✓ Cashmere: The fiber that comes from any type of goat other than an 
Angora is called cashmere. It’s the undercoat that you see on goats in 
varying degrees at the end of winter. Certain goats are bred for cash-
mere because they can produce up to 6 ounces of cashmere each year. 
The cashmere from solid-colored goats is more valuable than that from 
mixed-colored goats. In order to be considered cashmere, the undercoat 
has to be 19.5 microns in diameter or less.
 
 Cashmere-producing goats have both guard hair (long hairs forming the 
outer coat) and downy fiber (the softer undercoat), which need to be 
separated before spinning. You can do this by hand, but it takes a lot of 
time.
 
✓ Cashgora: Cashmere goat breeders use the term cashgora to refer to 
fiber from cashmere goats that doesn’t meet the criteria for cashmere. 
Some goats can have fiber that is deemed cashgora at one shearing and 
cashmere at another.
Fiber also commonly comes from two miniature fiber goats. Pygora goats are 
a cross between an Angora and a Pygmy, and Nigoras are a cross between an 
Angora and a Nigerian Dwarf. You might think of a Pygora or a Nigora as a 
sort of mini Angora. They can produce three different types of fiber, or differ-
ent variations and combinations among these types: 

273
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
 
✓ Type A is similar to mohair.
 
✓ Type B is like a blend of mohair and pygmy goat fiber.
 
✓ Type C is similar to cashmere.
You can expect a Pygora or a Nigora to produce from 6 ounces to 2 pounds of 
fiber at each shearing. You can shear goats that produce type A or A/Bs twice 
a year. You don’t even need to shear goats with type B and C fiber because 
they shed their downy undercoats in the spring, which means that you can 
comb or pluck the fiber instead.
 
All types of fiber mat if they are left on the goat too long. The upcoming sec-
tion “Shearing: How and when” lets you know when the time is right for 
removing the fiber.
Like cashmere-producing goats, most Pygoras and Nigoras produce guard 
hair and cashmere fiber, which need to be separated before spinning in order 
to create a better yarn. 
Shearing: How and when
You need to shear Angora goats twice a year to get the most fiber. You don’t 
shear cashmere- or cashgora-producing goats; instead you comb or pluck the 
fiber once a year.
 
You need to shear your mohair-producing goats in the early spring and early 
fall. Make sure not to shear cashmere-producing goats, because you will lower 
the value and quality of the fiber by mixing coarser guard hair with the fine, 
valuable cashmere.
Shearing isn’t hard to do, but it’s hard on your back because you have to 
bend over. If you have only a few goats you can use scissors or hand shears. 
If you can afford it and want to do all the shearing yourself, you can also 
invest in electric sheep shears, which range from $300 and up. Otherwise, 
you’re better off hiring a professional shearer to come to your farm. 
Professional shearers charge a per-goat fee.
You can work in tandem with the shearer — assisting, sorting, and bagging 
the fleeces while she shears. You can also give your goats needed vaccina-
tions (see Chapter 10), deworm them, and trim their hooves at the same time 
you’re having them shorn, saving you effort and preventing them the stress 
of getting out and being restrained twice.

274
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
To prepare your goats for shearing:
 
✓ A few weeks prior to shearing, use a pour-on insecticide containing per-
methrin or pyrethrin to kill lice and ticks.
 
✓ If the weather is rainy or snowy, keep your goats confined for 24 hours 
before shearing so that they stay dry.
 
✓ Clean and add new bedding to a dry shelter to keep the goats out of 
inclement weather for a month or so after they have been shorn. They’re 
more prone to health problems such as pneumonia without their protec-
tive coats.
Start your shearing with the youngest goats and work in order of age because 
the youngest usually have the best fiber.
 
When you’re shearing a goat, always use long, smooth strokes. Doing so 
keeps the fleece in longer pieces, which makes it easier to work with and 
increases its value. Be careful not to cut the skin, taking special care on the 
belly, the area where the legs and body meet, the scrotum, and the teats. If 
you do accidentally cut a goat while shearing, treat it with an antibiotic spray 
such as Blu-Kote.
Before you shear, get the following supplies together:
 
✓ Blow dryer
 
✓ Sheep shears 
 
✓ Grooming stand or stanchion
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Paper bags, pillowcases, or baskets to hold the fiber
 
✓ Postal or hanging scale for weighing fiber
Follow these steps to shear a goat:
 
1. Secure your goat on the stanchion or grooming stand.
 
2. Blow any hay or other debris out of the goat’s coat.
 
 Use your blow dryer on high speed.
 
3. Shear the goat’s belly.
 
 Start at the bottom of its chest and move to its udder or scrotal area.
 
4. Shear each side.
 
 Work from the belly up to the spine, back leg to front leg.
 
5. Shear each back leg.
 
 Work from the beginning of the coat upward to the spine.

275
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
 
6. Shear the neck.
 
 Start at the bottom of the throat and work to the top of the chest on the 
bottom and from the chest to the ears on the top and sides.
 
7. Shear the top of the back.
 
 Work from the crown of the head to the tail.
 
8. Remove any excess hair that you missed with your scissors.
 
 One area often missed is in the area of the udder or testicles.
 
9. Release your goat.
 
10. Check the fiber.
 
 Separate any stained or soiled fleece or other contaminants. Weigh the 
unsoiled fleece, roll it up, put it in a paper bag, and mark the bag with 
the weight of the fleece, the goat’s name and age, and the date sheared. 
Store fleece in a dry area.
 
11. Sweep the area. 
 
 Make sure the next goat to be sheared starts with a clean area.
 
Mohair and cashmere fibers are harvested differently. You comb or pull cash-
mere from the goat while you shear mohair. If you shear the cashmere, you’ll 
wind up with a lower quality product because it still contains the coarse guard 
hairs. Because of these longer, coarser hairs, you need to dehair (remove the 
hairs by machine or by hand) cashmere before processing.
Processing the fiber
Before you turn your goat fiber into yarn, you need to put it through several 
processes. To process your fiber, you need to go through the steps in the 
upcoming sections.
Washing
Unless you’re selling your raw fleece to a commercial operation that pur-
chases fiber from many buyers, you need to wash your sheared or plucked 
goat fleece to remove grease, dirt, and other impurities. To wash the fleece, 
you need:
 
✓ Mesh bags 
 
✓ pH test strips
 
✓ Baking soda
 
✓ Hand-washing detergent, such as Calgon
 
✓ Strong rubber gloves

276
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Follow these steps to wash your goat fleece:
 
1. Separate the fleece into smaller locks (bundles) and put them into 
mesh bags.
 
 Do not pack the fleece tightly into the bags.
 
2. Prepare your washing solution.
 
 Put 145° Fahrenheit water in your sink or another container. Wearing 
rubber gloves, check the water’s pH. If it is below 8, thoroughly mix 
in small amounts of baking soda until the pH is 8 or 9. (Neutral pH is 
7.) Then mix in a small amount of detergent. This combination helps 
remove any oils or dirt.
 
3. Wash your fleece.
 
 Place your bags of fleece in the water and soak for 15 minutes, checking 
the water to make sure it remains higher than 125° Fahrenheit.
 
 Pull out a bag and check a lock of fleece. If it is gummy, all of the grease 
is not out and you need to keep soaking it for up to another 45 minutes.
 
4. Wash the fleece a second time.
 
 Refill the sink with 145° Fahrenheit water, using only half the detergent 
and no baking soda. Soak for 15 more minutes.
 
5. Rinse the fleece.
 
 After the grease is out of the fleece, remove the fleece from the water 
and let out the water. Fill the sink with more hot water and soak the 
fleece for 15 to 30 minutes, agitating it with your hand from time to time.
 
6. Rinse again.
 
 Remove the bags, refill the sink, and rinse for 15 to 30 minutes, using 
cooler water each time. 
 
7. Rinse a final time.
 
 Check the pH of the final rinse; it should be 6. If it is higher, add a small 
amount of vinegar to lower the pH. A high pH can make the fiber less 
downy. Soak and rinse for 15 minutes.
 
8. Dry the clean fleece.
 
 Remove the bags, pressing gently, and then remove the mohair from 
the bags. Spread out the fleece to dry on a towel as you would a wool 
sweater. You can use a fan to accelerate drying.
Dyeing
You can use or sell your fiber in its natural color, or you can dye it. If you 
want to dye your fiber, do so after you have washed and dried it. You can 
use a commercial dye, a natural dye, or even Kool-Aid. Goat fibers take dye 
well but they have to be clean or the color will turn out uneven. Dyeing can 
coarsen cashmere somewhat.

277
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
 
You can get more information and tips on dyeing, using natural dyes, and 
books on dyeing at www.allfiberarts.com/cs/dyes.htm.
Carding or combing
Carding and combing are ways to separate the strands of washed fiber to pre-
pare it for spinning into yarn. Both methods blend the fibers and remove hay 
and other contaminants that may still be left in the fiber. They also straighten 
the fibers to make them lie in the same direction. Carding produces a fluffier 
end product than combing because combing better aligns the fibers and 
makes the fleece more compact.
 
The end product of carding or combing is a clump of fiber with individual 
fibers aligned called a rolag, roving, or batt. You create a rolag when you roll 
the finished fiber off the carder. When you form it into a long narrow bundle it 
is called a roving. A batt is simply a clump of carded or combed fiber. You use 
a rolag or a roving to spin. You use a batt (think of cotton batting) to stuff pil-
lows and other items.
You can card your fiber by hand or with a carding machine. You machine-
card with a drum carder or hand card with two hand carders. A drum carder is 
usually a hand-cranked machine with two toothed rollers that card the fiber. 
Hand carders are square or rectangular paddles that look a bit like animal 
grooming brushes with small wire bristles or pins.
To comb your fiber you can use paddle combs. These are similar to hand 
carders, but they are simpler and have only one or two rows of teeth. They 
are good for working medium to long fibers or for working with cashmere, 
where you have to remove the guard hairs as you go along. Combing sepa-
rates the long and short fibers and prepares the fiber for spinning.
 
Combs are sharp, so be careful when handling them and don’t leave them 
where children can get them.
You can find combs or carders at spinning supply stores or at an online spe-
cialty shop such as Pacific Wool and Fiber (www.pacificwoolandfiber.
com) or woolcombs.com (www.woolcombs.com). You can find a number of 
videos that demonstrate carding and combing on YouTube. 
Spinning
Spinning is simply using a tool to twist fiber to make yarn. Handspinning is 
the traditional method and requires a drop spindle (a weighted tool that you 
spin by hand to create yarn) or a spinning wheel (a machine with a wheel 
that you spin by using your feet). Commercial yarn producers use larger 
machines to produce quantities of yarn.

278
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
If you are raising fiber goats and want to get into spinning, I recommend start-
ing with a drop spindle before purchasing a spinning wheel. You can make 
your own or buy one for a reasonable price. You can also learn more about 
using a drop spindle or a spinning wheel from a spinning book at www.joyof
handspinning.com or www.handspinning.com.
You need to practice spinning the drop spindle without yarn to get used to 
working with it. To spin with a drop spindle you attach a piece of yarn (called 
a leader cord) to your spindle and then attach the end of your fiber to that. 
You have to spin in the same direction (normally clockwise) to hold your 
fiber together. As you spin the wheel, you gradually add fiber to the end of 
the rolag or roving you are working with.
Spinning on a wheel requires you to use your hands and feet. You use your 
feet by pushing on a treadle that keeps the wheel moving as you gradually 
add fiber to be spun into yarn. You need to practice to learn to move your 
hands and feet together and get a consistent product. After you get it, the 
process seems like second nature and spinners even say it’s incredibly 
relaxing.
Spinning wheels are expensive, and a variety of types are available. Before 
you run out and buy one, you need to answer several questions.
 
✓ Do you want to spin thin or thick yarn?
 
✓ Do you want a single or double treadle machine?
 
✓ How much money can you afford?
 
✓ How much space do you have to work in? 
 
✓ Is the machine upgradeable so you can modify it to produce a different 
type of yarn?
Talk to other spinners about what type and brand of wheel they use and 
what they recommend. Try out several spinning wheels before buying one if 
you can. If you plan to buy a used one, make sure it is in good working order 
before buying it.
Selling your fiber 
If you have more fiber than you can use, or if you don’t want to use the fiber 
yourself, you can sell it to other textile producers or spinners after you have 
washed it.

The markets for mohair, cashmere, and cashgora vary from year to year. 
Prices can be as low as $3 a pound and as high as $12 a pound for white 
mohair. You can’t usually sell colored mohair commercially but you can get 
as much as $25 a pound by selling to handspinners. The fiber from younger 
goats is more valuable because it’s finer.
Markets for fiber abound. Some ideas for selling your fiber include
 
✓ Farmers’ markets
 
✓ Online sites such as eBay or Craigslist
 
✓ A cooperative (an organization where fiber goat raisers join together to 
sell their fiber in bulk at a fair market price) such as Cashmere America 
Cooperative
 
✓ Conventions such as the Black Sheep Gathering (see sidebar)
 
✓ Advertising on a Web site or in local “thrifty” newspapers
 
If you harvest mohair, you might be eligible for a subsidy through the Wool and 
Mohair Subsidy program offered by the U.S. Government. The United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides subsidies to producers based on 
how much they sell. (But don’t count on this program for income. Some mem-
bers of Congress have been pressuring the Department of Agriculture to elimi-
nate the program.)
A loan program is also available to mohair producers through the 
government — the Wool and Mohair Assistance Loans and Loan Deficiency 
Payments program. You can find out more about these and other goat-
related programs by contacting your local Farm Service Agency (www.fsa.
usda.gov).
Black Sheep Gathering
Every year in Lane County, Oregon, an event 
called the Black Sheep Gathering (www.
blacksheepgathering.org) brings 
together people who raise colored fiber 
sheep, Angora goats, and Angora rabbits. The 
Gathering holds a large trade show with fiber 
supplies; provides educational information and 
demonstrations; sells handspinning fleeces; 
and holds a spinners’ circle. It’s a great place 
to network with other fiber goat breeders and 
learn the ins and outs of producing yarn from 
your goats’ fleece.

Showing Your Goats
Showing your goats is a great way to see how they compare to other goats of 
the same breed, to learn about what makes a good goat for the type you are 
raising, to teach kids (human children, that is) how to prepare and handle 
goats, and to just have a good time and get together with other goat aficio-
nados. Another benefit to showing goats is that it gives you a chance to find 
other goats to purchase and to market your own goats to other people.
 
Whether you show a meat goat, a fiber goat, or a dairy goat, make sure the 
goat is
 
✓ Healthy, with no obvious transmissible diseases such as soremouth, 
pinkeye, or ringworm.
 
✓ Well-nourished and not too skinny or fat.
 
✓ Registered with the appropriate registry. In some cases, such as 4-H 
shows, goats don’t have to be registered.
 
✓ Washed and brushed to remove excess hair and dirt.
 
✓ Fitted (prepared for presentation) according to the breed club or goat 
registry’s requirements for that type of goat and the show rules.
Finding shows
You can find goat shows for the breed you’re raising by 
 
✓ Talking to other goat owners
 
✓ Joining or contacting your local or regional goat club
 
✓ Checking the Web sites of the registry you register your goats with
 
✓ Contacting your local or state fair board to find out when the fair is 
scheduled and get on its mailing list
 
✓ Asking 4-H leaders about shows 
 
✓ Putting on your own show
Make sure to check well in advance for shows to avoid missing registration 
deadlines. A lot of clubs have an annual show, so if you miss it, you have a 
year to plan for the next one.

281
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
Preparing your goat for showing
You can’t just take a dirty, hairy, wild goat from the farm to a show. You need 
to do some basic training and pretty it up a bit first — washing, clipping, and 
trimming hooves. If you can, attend some shows before you show your own 
goats. Then, after you find a show and register, it’s time to prepare.
Clipping your goat
You don’t need to clip fiber goats for a show because they are judged in part 
on their fiber. You may need to clip meat and dairy goats before showing. 
Read the show rules before you clip your goat for a show, so that you meet 
their requirements. Some shows prohibit clipping and others require it.
 
If you do need to clip your goats, do it two weeks before a show. (See Chapter 
9 for information on basic clipping.) This allows any mistakes to grow out and 
makes the goat look better with a slight growth of hair. When a goat show is 
held in the early spring in a part of the country where the weather is still cold 
(a fuzzy goat show), you only need to do minimal clipping.
 
Make sure you let the clippers cool down when they get hot and apply clipper 
oil from time to time to keep them lubricated. These steps help prevent you 
from burning or cutting your goat.
To clip a goat for a show, you need 
 
✓ Clippers
 
✓ Clipper oil
 
✓ Scissors
 
✓ Brush
 
✓ #50 surgical blade
Follow these steps to clip a goat for a fuzzy goat show:
 
1. Secure the goat on a stanchion, by tying it with a short rope to a fence, 
or by having another person hold it.
 
2. Brush and clean the goat.
 
 Brush the goat thoroughly, removing any down. Then clean the goat’s 
coat with a waterless shampoo or use a few drops of mild dishwashing 
soap mixed with warm water in a spray bottle. Mist the coat and dry 
with a towel. Do this several times over the whole body until you can’t 
see any new dirt on the towel.

282
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
3. Clip with the grain of the hair, starting around the neck and cutting it 
shorter in the front.
 
4. Trim the hair with the grain from the front of the throat down to the 
shoulder and around the neck to the back.
 
 Put less pressure on the clippers to remove decreasing amounts of hair 
as you move to the back. Lightly clip to remove any long hair on the 
brisket.
 
5. Remove excess hair, clipping with the grain, between the elbow and 
knee on each leg. 
 
6. Still clipping with the grain of the hair, remove excess hair on the 
flank and belly.
 
7. Lightly clip along the grain to remove any long hair from the escutch-
eon and the back of the thigh.
 
8. Clipping against the grain, trim the sides of the tail and leave a 2-inch 
brush on top. 
 
 Use your scissors to even the end of the brush.
 
9. Working against the grain, remove the hair at the top of the hooves 
and under the dew claw.
 
10. Clip inside the ears.
 
 If your goat has ear tattoos for identification, this will help the judge see 
the tattoos. Use this opportunity to check for tattoos and compare to 
the tattoos on the registration certificate.
 
11. Clip off a doe’s beard, cutting against the grain. 
 
 Leave the beard on a buck; it makes him look more masculine.
 
12. Working against the grain, clip as much hair off your goat’s face and 
ears as you can get. 
 
 You don’t have to trim the bony part of the face because the hair is thin 
here already. Trim up the neck and chin. Trim the cheeks on each side, 
keeping them symmetrical. Trim the poll (top of the head where the 
horns were).
 
13. Shave the udder of a senior dairy doe with a 50 (surgical) blade.
 
 Clip the udder when it’s full so you’re less likely to nick or cut it. You’ll 
also do a better job on a full udder. 
 
 Lift one leg at a time to clip the sides and back of the udder. Hold each 
teat between the thumb and two fingers to avoid nicking as you trim 
around it. 

283
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
 
 If the medial ligament (the attachment in the back that runs between 
the two halves of the udder) has a deep cleft, leave a little hair on the 
bottom of that line so it is not accentuated. If the medial ligament is not 
strong, leave a small amount of hair on the bottom of each half of the 
udder.
 
 If the foreudder attachment (attachment of the front of the udder by the 
belly) isn’t smooth, leave about 2 inches of slightly longer hair down the 
middle of the belly to give it a smoother appearance.
 
14. Brush the hair off your goat and evaluate the result of your clipping.
 
 If necessary, neaten up by removing excess hair that you have missed. 
You can use scissors or press lightly with clippers, going with the grain 
of hair.
 
15. Give your goat a final brushing to remove cut hair and then put her 
away.
Trimming hooves
You need to trim your goats’ hooves a day or two prior to a goat show. 
(Chapter 9 gives you instructions for trimming hooves.) Untrimmed hooves 
affect the way a goat walks and holds itself, which contribute to how a judge 
scores it. Some judges even lift up the goats’ feet and look at the hooves.
 
Take extra care not to cut too deep. You don’t want your goat limping around 
the ring.
Practicing showing techniques
Put a collar on your goat and start lead-training at least six weeks before the 
show and practice at least three times a week. (See Chapter 8 for information 
on lead-training.)
You also need to practice setting up your goat. To set up your goat, stop 
walking, and then go to one side. Make sure the front legs are placed squarely 
under the goat’s shoulders and not splayed out and its back legs are evenly 
aligned with the hips. Stand up and make sure the goat’s back is straight. 
Hold up the lead or collar so your goat holds her head high.
Even when you aren’t being judged on your showmanship abilities, knowing 
how to set your goat up properly shows your goat to its best advantage and 
can contribute to a higher placing in the ring.

284
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Getting your supplies together
The supplies you need to bring depend on whether the show is part of a fair 
that requires animals to remain for a number of days for exhibit or is just a 
local one-day goat show. At some shows, animals simply stay in their trans-
port vehicles rather than moving into temporary pens.
Some basic supplies you need to bring to a show include
 
✓ Feeding supplies: Water buckets, feed bowls, hay racks or bags, hay, 
grain
 
✓ Clean-up supplies: Bleach water or other sanitizer, spray bottle, broom, 
pitchfork
 
✓ Grooming supplies: Clippers, hoof trimmers, stanchion, soap and 
towels, coveralls, brush — for last-minute preparation
 
✓ Showing supplies: Show clothes, show collars, leads, registration 
papers, show program
 
✓ Marketing materials: Farm sign, sales list, educational brochures
 
✓ Miscellaneous: Bedding (if not supplied by the organization holding the 
show), milking supplies, short hose (to attach to water supply), health 
certificates (if required), camera (to photograph winners), chair, goat 
coats (if overnight or cold weather), first aid kit
Earning more than just ribbons
Most goat shows don’t make money for goat owners; they cost money to 
enter. The exception is state or county fairs, which cost to enter but also pay 
premiums when your goats win. The amounts for premiums vary from fair 
to fair, but if your goats place high, you can make some money to help with 
your feed bill.
Fairs also help you make money on your goats indirectly by giving you a 
venue to display them in. You get a chance to promote your goats and edu-
cate the many people who come by. If you have ribbons to display, visitors 
may be even more interested in buying some. In some cases, people I talked 
to at a fair bought goats from me several years later. (See the upcoming sec-
tion “Marketing at shows” for more on how you can attract potential buyers 
and sell your goats.)
If your goats place well in the competition, other breeders who are showing 
their goats or just watching the show may be interested in buying one of your 
herd. On the other hand, if you’re like most of us goat lovers, you may come 
home from the fair with one more — instead of one fewer — goat.

285
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
Marketing at shows
 
Showing your goats is marketing. You’re getting them out in front of potential 
buyers, even if you aren’t aware of it. That’s just one more reason to exhibit 
good showmanship and show off your animals to their advantage.
Your goat pens or exhibit area also can help your marketing efforts. You can 
get a relatively inexpensive sign or banner to attach to pens so people know 
who your goats belong to. Make sure to keep your area neat, and include 
marketing materials there and at any information tables provided. Ideas for 
marketing materials include:
 
✓ Business cards 
 
✓ Sales lists of goats you currently have on the market
 
✓ Educational materials, such as a brochure describing the breed of goat 
you raise, or basic goat care
 
✓ Photos of your goats and information on awards they’ve won
Talk to other exhibitors and any visitors when they’re looking at your goats. 
Politely answer questions and don’t be shy about letting them know about 
goats you’re selling and why they’re a good buy.
Creating Mini Breeds
For some reason, people love miniature animals. My first goats were Nigerian 
Dwarves because I loved their small size, their markings, and the fact that 
they produce such good milk, which has high butterfat and protein and 
makes a proportionately large amount of cheese compared to some other 
dairy goats’ milk.
While I was proud of my Nigerian Dwarves, I soon became enamored with 
the Oberhasli because of its beautiful red and black markings. In addition, 
although I was breeding my goats for milkable udders and had started with a 
champion Nigerian, I liked the idea of creating a new breed and increasing my 
goats’ milk yield, as well as making some money. Urban farmers and people 
with small acreages are more likely to buy miniature, yet functional, goats 
than the larger breeds because they are easier to handle, take up less space, 
and may even be the only kind of goat legally allowed. (For more on choosing 
the right goats for your needs, see Chapter 7.)
When you breed mini-goats, you create a new experimental breed. The Pygora 
is a miniature fiber-producing goat from a cross between the Angora and the 
Pygmy, and the Kinder is a miniature milk and meat goat from a cross between 
a Nubian and a Pygmy. When these breeds were introduced, the Nigerian Dwarf 
was still considered an exotic breed and was more expensive and harder to get.

286
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
Now Nigerian Dwarves are quite popular and easy to find. As a result, hybrids 
using the Nigerian Dwarf are appearing.
 
✓ Mini dairy goats are created by crossing a Nigerian Dwarf with any of the 
standard breeds of dairy goat. (See Chapter 3.) Their breed standards 
mirror those of the full-size goats, except that they are expected to be 
smaller.
 
✓ Mini silkies are another type of goat that is growing in popularity. These 
beautiful little goats come from a cross between a Nigerian Dwarf and a 
Fainting goat. They don’t have to faint because they are instead valued 
for their long, silky coats.
 
✓ Nigoras are miniature Angoras that are bred using the Nigerian Dwarf 
rather than the Pygmy. They produce colorful fiber similar in quality to 
that of the Pygora.
You can breed minis without registering them, and many people who 
want miniature goats don’t care about having registered goats or are even 
opposed to registering their goats. But consider registering or buying reg-
istered minis, because you can’t usually go back and register unregistered 
goats and their offspring.
 
If you’re interested in raising mini goats, contact one of the mini goat regis-
tries for the breed you’re interested in to learn more about them:

My mini-tale of mini-breeding
I started my mini Oberhaslis (I call them 
Oberians) by breeding two Oberhaslis to two 
bucks — one black and one buckskin (tan with 
a black cape and facial stripes). I got lucky and 
got correctly marked first generation (F1) kids, 
but found that in future generations that wasn’t 
always the case; some had white spots that 
aren’t correct for the breed standard. The minis 
are about the size of a large dog. Minimum 
height for does is 21 inches and for bucks it is 
23 inches. Because they are still evolving, these 
height standards will change, too.
They are too new to know what to expect in 
terms of maximum milk production, but they 
can produce more than eight pounds (1 gallon) 
a day. They also eat only two-thirds as much as 
a standard breed.

Offering Buck Service 
I discourage people from buying bucks right off the bat, because they have a 
very strong odor during breeding season, they need to be housed separately 
from does, they can become aggressive, and they often are an unnecessary 
expense for anyone who wants to keep a small herd. As a result, buyers 
return to me asking where they can get their does bred. If I have the right 
buck for them and their goals, we breed one of my bucks to their doe(s) — 
for a price. Hiring out a buck for breeding is called buck service.
You can provide buck service in a couple of different ways, and I have used 
all of them at one time or another:
 
✓ Leasing your buck to another breeder: When you lease your buck to 
another breeder, the buck goes to live at that person’s farm for the 
purpose of breeding does. Before you lease a buck to another breeder, 
make sure you know the living conditions and the health status of her 
goats, and make sure you have a contract. Contract terms need to cover 
at least the following points:
 
• Period of time the buck will stay
 
• Charge for breeding each doe and when that fee will be paid
 
• Agreement that the buck will be adequately cared for
 
• Requirement that the person leasing will communicate with the 
buck owner if the buck gets sick or injured
 
• Who is responsible if the buck gets sick or dies, including timeli-
ness in contacting a veterinarian, who will pay for veterinary care, 
and whether additional money is due if he dies
 
• What the buck will be fed and who will pay for it
 
• How many does the lessee plans to have bred and whether any 
does from another farm may be bred to the buck
 
• Acknowledgment that the buck and does have no known diseases
 
• What happens if the does don’t settle (get pregnant) — most breed-
ers provide a second breeding at no additional cost
 
• Agreement that buck owner will sign a service memo (a document 
required by registries to prove parentage)

288
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
 
✓ Driveway breeding: When you breed a goat by bringing the buck or 
the doe to another farm for only that purpose, it’s called a driveway 
breeding. You can do a driveway breeding at your farm or another farm. 
Usually you bring the doe to the buck, because he is providing the ser-
vice. A driveway breeding has the advantages of exposing your buck to 
much less health risk and letting you control the breeding because the 
goats spend very little time together.
 
✓ Boarding doe(s) with your buck: If you agree to board does for breeding 
with your buck, you need to have a stall where they can be kept sepa-
rate from the rest of your goats. You can let the buck live with them, or 
just bring him in when they are in heat. This helps to ensure the safety 
and health of the doe and the rest of your goats.
 
 I usually suggest that the breeder bring the doe when he knows she is 
in heat or a few days before she is due to be in heat. (See Chapter 12.) If 
we’re lucky, what started out as a boarding becomes a driveway breed-
ing. And if not, I usually keep the doe for a month to ensure that she is 
with the buck 21 days or so later when she goes into heat again.
 
Make sure that you protect yourself and your goats with a contract. Most of 
the same terms apply for boarding a doe and leasing a buck. You especially 
want to make sure that the doe coming to your property is healthy.
Selling Compost
I think every goat owner can agree: goats produce a lot of poop. What do you 
do with all of it? As it turns out, compost made of goat manure and straw 
(goats’ bedding) is great for the garden.
Whether you want to go so far as to develop a system that speeds along the 
process or just pile up the muck and let nature work its magic, the end result 
will be the same: rich, black dirt also known as compost. Compost is good for 
the soil because it helps balance pH, retain moisture, prevent compaction, 
add body, and retain nutrients. Check out Organic Gardening For Dummies to 
get the complete lowdown on compost.
 
You can just put goat manure right on the garden because, unlike chicken and 
sheep manure, goat manure isn’t “hot” — that is, it has a lower concentration 
of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. However, experts recommend aging 
manure for at least six months or composting it to 150° Fahrenheit to prevent 
the spread of diseases such as listeriosis to humans when they eat garden pro-
duce that is contaminated.

289
 Chapter 16: Further Benefits of Goats
I trade compost that accumulates in a pile on my property for meat and vege-
tables from neighboring farmers, because we tend to deal more in barter than 
money in my neck of the woods. If you don’t have a pasture or garden that 
will benefit from the addition of your excess goat compost, you can prob-
ably sell it through word of mouth, by advertising on Craigslist, or by posting 
signs in local stores and watering holes.
Hiring Out for Weed Control
More and more cities and other municipalities are using goats and sheep to 
control noxious weeds. This practice has at least two benefits: It provides 
an alternative to using herbicides, and it creates firebreaks (areas cleared of 
combustible material) that help control wildfires.
You can use your own goats to eat noxious weeds on your property, but if 
you want to make some money and provide your goats with free browse, 
consider hiring them out. You may find more opportunities to do this as laws 
restricting the use of pesticides and herbicides get stricter.
To hire out your goats you need:
 
✓ Good transportation for getting goats to and from the site
 
✓ Portable fencing, so that you keep the goats safe and focused on the 
project for which they’ve been hired
 
✓ A guardian dog or other protection in areas with predators
 
✓ Insurance to cover any mishaps
 
✓ A written contract outlining both parties’ responsibilities
Talk to other goat owners who have rented out their goats for vegetation con-
trol to learn more about other requirements by organizations that hire goat 
herds, how much you should expect to charge, and contract provisions you 
need to include before you offer the services of your goats.
Providing “Goat Therapy”
Anyone who has had goats and really gotten to know them will tell you how 
relaxing they are to be around. Maybe they hypnotize us with the constant, 
repetitive ruminating. (Not to mention that there’s nothing like the hard labor 
of mucking a barn to leave you feeling relaxed.) I call this calming effect goat 
therapy.

290
Part IV: Living Sustainably and Making Money from Your Goats 
I’ve had the good fortune to spend a large part of my career working from 
home, so instead of (or along with) a coffee break I can take a “goat break.” 
After more than ten years with goats I still enjoy walking to the barn to hang 
out with these amazing animals.
They’re usually calm (when not scuffling for food or in heat or rut) and 
enjoy being petted. Although I’m not aware of any studies that have been 
conducted with goats specifically, many studies have shown that having a 
pet can lower your heart rate and prevent depression. And if you need some 
exercise, you can take your goat on a walk.
Because of goats’ gentle nature, a few people have begun to use them as 
service animals for children with autism or to visit elderly people who live in 
nursing homes. (See Chapter 8.) 
When everything else seems to be going wrong, there’s nothing like a little 
goat therapy.

Ten Common Mistakes First-Time 
Goat Owners Make
In This Chapter

▶ Getting the right goats
▶ Making sure you’re ready for goats
A
fter more than a decade of raising goats, I have seen people make a lot 
of mistakes, and I have made some myself. The average length of time 
that a person owns goats is only around five years. One reason is that they 
have unrealistic expectations of what owning goats requires.
This chapter covers some of the most common mistakes that people make 
when they start on their goat adventure. I hope it saves you some time and 
energy and helps keep you from making mistakes.
Getting Too Many Goats Too Fast
Time and again I have seen people decide to get into goats and then go out 
and start buying goats from various farms that are reputed for their quality. 
What they fail to consider is that the goats may not just double in number 
during the first kidding season — they may triple or quadruple if the goats 
are fertile! And these new little goats will grow — leading to cramped quarters, 
more likelihood of disease due to crowding, and more money coming out of 
your pockets for food and equipment.
I started reasonably with two doe kids, planning to breed them that fall and 
milk them in the spring when they kidded. I didn’t realize how cute their kids 
would be and what a hard time I would have giving them up. Each doe had 
a buckling and a doeling that next spring and I just had to keep one of each. 
Within three months I needed a separate space for my buck, which meant 
getting another buck or a wether. This continued for a number of years (think 
rabbits) until I finally came to my senses and reversed the trend.

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
So I am speaking from experience when I say: Start slow and don’t get the 
maximum number of goats that your farm can handle right away. And then 
think about what you are doing when you start breeding your goats. They 
grow exponentially, and all of the kids are way too cute!
Failing to Educate Yourself 
before Getting Goats
I don’t know how many times I’ve heard, “I want to get a couple of goats to 
control the blackberries on my property.” When I ask about fencing, where 
the goats will sleep, or how the potential owners will protect their goats from 
the things they don’t want the goats to eat, they seem puzzled. They hadn’t 
thought about that; in fact, they didn’t even know that these could be problems.
 
Raising goats is a big responsibility. You have these animals’ lives in your 
hands and need to take that seriously. You can’t just put them out in a field 
and expect them to do well. They need to have their hooves trimmed; to be 
monitored for parasites; to be given a safe shelter, clean water, and appropriate 
food; and so on. They require time, money, care, and knowledge to thrive and 
survive.
Not educating yourself about goats and goat ownership is a guarantee for 
either a short-lived goat experience or a much more expensive undertaking 
than you had planned.
Underestimating the Costs
Whether you just want to raise a couple of goats for milk or pets, or a herd 
of meat goats, don’t make the mistake of underestimating setup and ongoing 
costs. I’ve had to add new fencing to my property and replace fencing that 
had worn out a lot more often than I had anticipated. And who realized that 
those plastic water buckets actually break after a few years? Or that rats can 
chew through plastic garbage cans?
One stanchion might work for the two dairy goats you have in the beginning, 
but down the road you find that you need one or two more. And routine 
medications actually expire after a year or two and have to be replaced even 
though you haven’t used them.
Raising goats reminds me of what my grandpa used to say: “If I had a million 
dollars I would go back into farming until the money ran out.”

295
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Mistakes First-Time Goat Owners Make
 
Failing to provide for the goats, in the beginning or along the way, will cost 
more in the long run — whether it be vet bills, losses to predators, the 
annoyance of goat escapes, or even your back when you have difficulty 
controlling the goats to do routine care.
Paying Too Much or Too 
Little for Your Goats
Not all offspring from prize-winning, high-milking, well-muscled, or perfectly 
conformed goats will be champions, good producers, or even acceptable for 
anything other than pets.
Buying goats from a breeder who has a good Web site and sells a lot of goats 
or one whose goat won a junior championship doesn’t guarantee that what 
they sell you will be the best. Find out the going rate for the type of goat 
you want, comparison shop, and if you can, ask other buyers about their 
experiences buying from the seller.
Besides figuring out what the goats are worth to you, consider whether the 
high-priced goats will better meet your needs or pay for themselves in the 
long run. On the other hand, beware of bargain goats. There’s no such thing 
as a free goat! If someone offers goats for next to nothing, ask why. You want 
to get a suitable goat the first time around rather than going through a bunch 
of cheap goats that don’t fit your needs or keeping unsuitable goats because 
you’ve gotten attached to them.
Getting Only One Goat
In almost all cases, getting only one goat is a recipe for trouble. Goats are not 
dogs and do not thrive on human companionship alone.
 
Goats are herd animals and need other goats to keep them healthy and happy. 
A goat without a friend will cry and can even become depressed. Never get 
just one goat; always buy at least two goats so they can keep each other 
company.
Dogs, pigs, and cows are not the best friends for a goat. Sheep, rabbits, and 
horses can be friends with goats. Goats have traditionally been kept with 
racehorses and are known to have a calming effect on them. Remember that 
if you do decide to bond your goat with an animal other than another goat, 
the animal needs to stay with the goat.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
People with small farms who have only a few animals sometimes keep a goat 
and a sheep together. This situation has certain risks:
 
✓ The copper needs of sheep and goats are substantially different, and 
the minerals needed by goats contain a level of copper that is toxic to 
sheep.
 
✓ The only known cases of scrapie (a disease like “mad cow disease”) in 
goats were in goats that were housed with sheep. Sheep can also give 
goats OPPV (the sheep version of CAEV).
 
✓ Male sheep (rams) and female goats can and will interbreed, but the 
fetus normally dies before birth.
Buying Unhealthy Goats
A lot of people are tempted to buy goats at an auction where they can get a 
“good deal.” Although some of these animals may be a good deal, you can’t 
tell by looking at them whether they have an underlying health problem. 
Many owners of large herds take their goats to auction to get them out of the 
herd because they have an illness or don’t meet their herd requirements, so 
either don’t take that chance or be prepared for a negative outcome.
I am not discounting those among us who rescue injured or sick animals. I am 
just warning against inadvertently buying a goat that may be sick. If you have 
other goats, you can bring diseases from the sale barn that affect your herd.
When you buy from a breeder, look closely at the goats and make sure to ask 
about the goats’ health, the herd health, and whether they have been tested 
for certain diseases. Get a contract so that you have legal recourse if you 
later find that the goat had a pre-existing health problem.
Neglecting Routine Management 
and Care
Properly caring for goats is a daily job. In most cases, goats need to be fed 
and given clean water twice a day. In addition, they require periodic hoof 
trimming, routine medical care, handling, and grooming. If you let these 
responsibilities slide, the goat is defenseless, much like a child who relies 
on you.

297
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Mistakes First-Time Goat Owners Make
Neglecting routine care adds to your workload because you have to work 
twice as hard to catch up. Worse, you put your goats at risk of poor health 
when they have to drink from dirty buckets, eat hay off the ground, and walk 
on overgrown hooves. Don’t make this mistake; set a routine that you and 
your goats can rely on.
Overlooking Your Goats’ Dietary Needs
Unless you have a huge acreage that is covered with plentiful weeds and 
other plants that goats like to eat, you need to buy them hay. Don’t expect 
your goats to spend their time eating grass on a lawn; they like a variety of 
plants, which is why they’re considered browsers rather than grazers.
Goats also need mineral supplementation, which varies according to the part 
of the country you live in. Different areas are deficient in different essential 
minerals and you need to provide those in the proper amounts. Dairy goats 
that you are milking also need grain, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds to keep 
their production high and their milk rich in butterfat.
You get back what you put into a goat, and even pets or goats whose job is 
just to clear the property will be healthier if they are fed right. Chapter 6 tells 
you more about feeding goats.
Giving the Goats Too Little Attention
Although they have been domesticated for over 10,000 years, goats are quick 
to return to a feral state. This means that they need attention and handling if 
they’re to remain friendly.
Often, goat owners avoid only certain goats — maybe the smelly bucks or the 
skittish members of the herd that require effort to catch. These goats then 
get harder and harder to catch for routine care.
You can avoid this mistake and make goat ownership easier on yourself by 
taking time to interact with your goats several times a day, when you change 
their water or feed them. At the same time, you can do a daily visual herd 
check to make sure that they aren’t showing any signs of illness.

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Getting a Buck before You’re Ready
Bucks are not for everyone. Raising a buck is a big responsibility and an 
aromatic proposition. Bucks don’t normally make good pets and you 
shouldn’t get one with that idea in mind. If you want pets, start with a 
wethers or, if you must, does. They don’t stink and are not as strong and 
aggressive.
 
If you’re raising goats for milk or meat, ask about leasing a buck from the 
breeder where you bought your does, or doing a driveway breeding instead of 
purchasing your own buck. (Chapter 12 tells you more about breeding.) You’ll 
save money in feed and housing, and your property will smell better.
If you start a herd with two does that you want to breed, I can almost 
guarantee that you will want to keep one of the bucks that is born the next 
year. If you have already purchased a buck, now you will have two fighting, 
reeking animals that need a separate pen.
Because bucks are the basis of your breeding program, think it through 
before you buy your own buck. You won’t regret it.

f you have purebred goats and are interested in competing or want to see 
how your goats compare to others of the same breed, you can show them 
at fairs and other events put on by different goat associations. Showing has 
the added benefit of helping you market your goats. (Chapter 16 tells you 
more about showing goats.)
You can have the greatest goat in the world, but if you aren’t prepared and 
your goat jumps around the ring, tries to lie down when it’s supposed to 
stand, and acts skittish and confused, the judge is less likely to see all of the 
goat’s wonderful attributes. By the same token, if you don’t know how to act, 
you may also lose points as you will not be presenting your animal to its best 
advantage.
If you decide to show your goats, you’ll do better and feel better knowing 
what the judge expects from you. Children in 4-H can learn showmanship at 
their meetings. If you can’t do this, go watch some goat shows to learn, or 
even better, watch 4-H-ers competing for showmanship. Check the schedule 
for your local county or state fair to find out when such a competition will 
occur.
In this chapter I give you ten tips for showing your goat to its best advantage.

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Practice Walking with Your 
Goat before the Show
If a goat show is the first time your goat becomes acquainted with a collar 
and a lead, don’t expect it to do very well. Even a well-trained goat may be a 
little nervous during the show because of unfamiliarity with the show ring, 
but if you lead-train first, at least the goat has an idea of what you expect. 
(To find out about lead-training, see Chapter 8.) A goat with outstanding 
conformation that is leaping around the ring rather than walking slowly and 
calmly will most likely not place as high as it should.
The first time I took my goats to a show I had no idea what to expect. The 
goats were totally out of control and placed fifth and seventh, to the chagrin 
of the person who sold them to me. By the next show we had more experience; 
they knew how to walk and they placed first and second. This gives you an 
idea of how much difference experience walking with a goat can make.
While you’re working with your goat on walking, take the time to set her up 
the way that a judge would like to see her so she also has experience with 
that. (See the upcoming section “Keep Your Goat Properly Set Up” for details 
about how to set her up.)
Thoroughly Clean and Groom 
Your Goat before the Show
Another part of showing your goat to its best advantage is having the goat 
groomed according to the accepted standard for that breed. You can get 
general information about these standards from the registry for your breed 
and specifics from the show registration information. 
Before a show, you need to
 
✓ Buy your goat a nice, clean collar.
 
✓ Trim your goat’s hooves, not only for looks but so that the judge can see 
that she walks correctly and doesn’t have defects of the foot or leg.
 
✓ Bathe and properly comb and/or clip your goat according to the 
standard for that type of goat.

301
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Showing Your Goat
Dress Appropriately
Most goat shows require you to wear certain clothes when showing your 
goats. The standard is a white shirt and a white skirt or pants for dairy goats, 
and a white shirt and black pants for others. Many people wear a white 
shirt with their herd name and logo on it. (You can have these made by a 
company that does embroidery or screen printing.) You won’t be barred or 
removed from a show for wearing other clothes, but if you’re being judged on 
showmanship, you’ll lose points. 
 
Don’t wear flip-flops or soft shoes in the ring in case a goat steps on your foot. 
Try to keep your show clothes clean before you enter the ring.
Keep Your Goat between 
You and the Judge
 
When you show your goat, you want the judge to be able to see it at all times. 
Never get between your goat and the judge.
To change the side of the goat you’re walking next to, do a roll turn. If you’re 
walking clockwise with the lead in your right hand, just before you get to the 
judge, turn around the front of your goat and change to your left hand. You 
can reach over your goat to set the legs that are on the far side from you. 
Always set the legs closest to the judge first; if the judge is in front of you, for 
example, set the front legs first.
Move to the front of your goat when the judge views the goats from the rear. 
As the judge moves to the right side and around to the front of the goat, 
move to the goat’s left side, keeping him between you and the judge. When 
the judge is in front of the goat, remain on the goat’s left side, so the judge 
can see the front view. Hold the goat’s head up with the collar, your left hand 
under the goat’s jaw. As the judge moves to the left of the goat, move back to 
the front of the goat so the judge can see the entire animal.
Keep Your Eyes on the Judge at All Times
The judge will tell you what you need to do and may ask questions about 
your goat. If you’re distracted, you might lose track of what’s going on. Keep 
your eyes on the judge so that you always know what’s happening.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Even though the judges are trained on the same standards for evaluating the 
goats, you will find some variations. Keeping your eyes on the judge lets you 
know what to do next and may even give you clues about what parts of the 
goat the judge is most interested in.
Don’t Talk with Your Neighbor
Talking with the person next to you while the judge is thinking about 
placements, comparing goats, or examining each goat is considered rude, 
distracting, and unshowmanlike. Remember that you are in the ring to show 
your goats to the best of their advantage and focus on the task at hand. The 
judge isn’t supposed to judge the goat based on the handler’s behavior, but 
she has the power to place your goat anywhere.
Remain Calm Even If Your 
Goat Is Misbehaving
Despite being trained and walking on a lead perfectly at home, a goat may 
get bored, scared, or just ornery and misbehave in the show ring. Don’t ever 
hit the goat or treat it roughly. Remain as calm as possible and do what the 
judge asks to the best of your ability. Some goats act up from time to time, so 
you just have to maintain a sense of humor and a good attitude. 
Do What the Judge Asks
You will start by walking the goat into the ring in a clockwise direction. Keep 
your goat under control with her head up, and keep her between you and 
the judge. If your goat doesn’t want to move, gently lift the goat’s tail. When 
the judge asks you to stop, set your goat up in a straight line, facing the same 
direction as the other goats. Stand or squat on the goat’s other side or near 
her head. Stay alert for another request and keep the goat set up.
If you’re asked to change your goat’s place with another goat, turn the goat 
around and move behind the line of other goats to that position. If you’re 
asked to walk your goat to compare with another goat, walk your goat slowly, 
at the same pace and as near to the other goat as possible for easy comparison.

303
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Showing Your Goat
Keep Your Goat Properly Set Up
When you’re showing a goat, the judge will ask you to stop and line up so 
that all the goats face the same direction. Then she will evaluate each goat 
based on the criteria for the breed she is judging. You need to make certain 
you’re showing your goat to his best advantage.
To set up your goat make sure that his weight is evenly distributed. Don’t 
splay the legs. Set up a dairy doe so that you can see a third of the udder 
in front and a third behind the back leg. Set up the rear legs first and then 
the front legs. Hold the goat’s head up. Make sure his front legs are straight 
down from shoulders.
During a show continue to keep your goat set up and show her to her best 
advantage even when the judge is focusing on another goat and even if you 
think the judge has determined the goats’ placements. A judge can change her 
mind at any time during the show. You can relax a little, especially if your goat 
is getting upset about standing so long, but continue to keep your animal in 
place and looking as good as possible until the judge dismisses the class.
Be a Good Loser (or Winner)
After judges determine rankings, they explain their reasons for awarding 
placements as they did. Listen closely to those reasons. Regardless of your 
placing, congratulate the class winners and other goat owners who placed 
ahead of you. Make an effort to learn from the experience. If you lose, don’t 
complain. If you win, be gracious.
 
You may ask the judge about placements after the show is over if you truly 
need help understanding the judge’s reasons. Do not question the judge in the 
ring or delay the next group of goats to be shown by asking questions.

Ten Misconceptions about Goats
In This Chapter
▶ Dispelling misconceptions about goats
▶ Knowing the true characteristics of goats
P
eople have a lot of ideas about goats that simply aren’t true. As a 
result, goats have gotten a reputation that they don’t deserve. When 
the people who hold some of these beliefs actually raise goats, the goats can 
suffer from a lack of proper care. For example, I actually had someone ask 
me whether they could raise a goat in their house and feed it table scraps — 
which leads to the first misconception . . . .
Goats Will Eat Anything
No doubt you’ve seen a cartoon with a goat eating a tin can. That depiction is 
about as real as a wise-cracking rabbit or a caped crusader. Goats don’t eat 
tin cans. The tin can–eating image of a goat probably came about because a 
goat was trying to eat the label off of a can. (Yes, they do eat paper.)
Goats are actually quite picky eaters in a lot of ways. They’re notorious for 
wasting hay — after it hits the ground, hay becomes bedding for all but the 
most starving goat. Goats can be quite difficult about changes in feed until 
they get used to it or realize that’s all they’re getting.
Goats do like variety, and they take little nibbles here and there. They also 
can eat some plants that are considered poisonous to other animals without 
any problem, but they reject many plants out of hand (or hoof). Goats also 
are vegetarians, which eliminates a lot of foods from their diet, and they 
prefer their vegetables raw, thank you very much.
Although goats won’t eat just anything, they will undoubtedly pull a clean 
shirt off the clothesline and possibly take a few bites, just like in the song 
“Bill Grogan’s Goat.”

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Goats Stink
Goats have gotten a reputation for having a strong, disagreeable scent 
because the bucks do have a powerful odor during breeding season, when 
they pee on themselves as a kind of cologne for the ladies. They smell pretty 
mild the rest of the time. The does never have a strong smell, unless they’re 
rubbing up against a buck in love.
Goats create less of a stink in the barn and the barnyard than many other 
animals — including cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep — because of their 
unique poop. A goat that is healthy and isn’t eating too much rich food has 
nicely pelleted poop with only a mild odor.
Goats Aren’t Very Smart
Intelligence in an animal is hard to prove. One of the ways that I gauge the 
intelligence of an animal is how long it takes to learn its name. My first calf 
took three months, while most of my goats learn their names in less than a 
month. I believe that goats’ intelligence is on par with that of dogs.
Goats can learn how to open locked gates. They can identify their owners 
walking two aisles over from their pen at the fair. (I know because my goat 
Jinx could do just that.) I even had a goat that housebroke herself. Goats can 
be taught to pack, to pull a cart, and to go through an obstacle course — all 
indicators that goats are smart.
People who think that goats aren’t smart either have them mixed up with 
sheep or are confusing a goat’s refusal to do what they say with stupidity.
Goats Make Good Lawn Mowers
Goats are browsers, not grazers. Goats mow down blackberries and kudzu; 
sheep mow lawns. Browsers move a lot, preferring leaves, bark, and stems, 
while grazers stand still to eat vegetation at or near ground level. Browsing 
gives goats an advantage when snow is covering plants because the parts 
they prefer are more likely to be exposed. Goats are disadvantaged in terms 
of nutrition, though, because the parts they like may not have the nutrients 
that can be found in grass.
 
Don’t expect goats to mow your lawn like sheep would, but if you have 
pasture they do adapt and learn to use it as a feed source, even though they 
prefer woody browse.

307
 Chapter 19: Ten Misconceptions about Goats
Goat Milk Tastes Bad
The misconception that goat milk tastes bad is one of the hardest to change, 
probably because goat milk can taste bad. Not following sanitary practices, not 
straining the hair and hay out of the milk, not cooling it down fast enough, 
letting it sit too long, and milking near bucks or other odors can cause goat 
milk to go off flavor.
Fresh goat milk tastes even better than cow milk! The milk from a goat is 
sweet, and if it has a high butterfat content — such as Nigerian Dwarf milk — 
it is so rich that it can compete with half and half. I prefer it in my coffee 
because it adds such a great flavor. If you don’t believe me, experiment by 
getting some fresh goat milk and some cow milk and doing a blind taste test. 
Even if you can tell the difference, I bet the experiment changes your mind 
about whether goat milk tastes bad.
Goat Meat Tastes Bad
This misconception goes hand in hand with the belief that goats smell bad. 
I haven’t eaten the meat from a buck, but I have had some of the most 
tantalizing ribs from a friend’s wether. I can assure you that they didn’t taste 
gamey or goaty or anything other than mild and delightful.
Some people are undoubtedly more sensitive to or just dislike goat meat, but 
I recommend that you try it. (You’ll like it!)
Goats Get Most of Their 
Water from Plants
When I first moved to the country, my neighbor had a buck goat, Odin, that 
had been given to him as a gift. That neighbor never gave the goat water 
because he believed that goats get their water from plants and don’t need 
drinking water. Consequently, my daughter and I spent hot summer afternoons 
taking bowls of water to that poor goat as he stood tethered in the orchard. 
He rushed to the bowl and greedily drank it.
Goats need a lot of fresh, clean water and can drink more than a gallon a day. 
It would be hard to get this much water from a plant diet, particularly in a dry 
area. Even in lush areas a goat can get dehydrated from lack of water. And in 
males, lack of water can lead to the formation of urinary stones that can get 
stuck and block the urine, killing the goat.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can get by without giving your 
goats plenty of water (and changing it frequently — not only do goats need 
water, but they like it clean).
Goats Are Only for People 
Who Can’t Afford Cows
This misconception probably came about because people in developed (or 
rich) countries are more likely to use cows for milk and meat than those in 
developing (or poor) countries. But instead of thinking of goats as being for 
poor people, I think the reality is that goats are for practical people.
Goats cost less than cows to feed, need less space, use fewer resources, and 
are cleaner. They are compact, easy for women and children to handle, and 
produce just the right amount of milk and meat for a small family. And they 
are much smarter and more fun!
Only Male Goats Have Beards
Although bucks often have large, impressive beards, a lot of does also grow 
shorter, more feminine beards. Like horns, goats of both sexes have beards.
 
Goats have beards, but sheep don’t. Using this knowledge along with the fact 
that goats hold their tails up and sheep’s tails go down, you can learn to tell 
the difference between sheep and goats.
People who show their goats normally shave off the female beard and leave 
on the male beard because they want to accentuate the masculinity or 
femininity of the animal. This might be one of the reasons that people think 
only the males have beards — that’s what they saw at the fair!
A Dog Makes a Good Friend for a Goat
Goats need other goats. They are herd animals and need the rest of the herd 
or they will be lonely.

309
 Chapter 19: Ten Misconceptions about Goats
Goats’ play is different from dogs’ and they don’t have the right equipment to 
defend themselves successfully against a dog’s teeth. Horned goats do have 
some advantage and could injure a dog. Many dogs find sport in chasing a 
goat — a practice that can cause stress in the goat and even kill it.
My livestock guardian dog, Marley, lived with the bucks and started acting 
like he was a goat. At one point, the bucks even tried to breed him, so maybe 
they thought he was a goat, too. But when it came to playing, they weren’t 
evenly matched. They all learned that he could live with them, but he wasn’t 
a friend.

f you have more than a couple of dairy goats and don’t have a lot of kids 
(human or goat), you may find yourself overwhelmed with goat milk. It’s 
great in coffee, on cereal or just plain, and you can use it to make cheese, 
yogurt, ice cream, and much more.
Cheeses and Yogurt
Cheeses are satisfying to make and can be simple or complicated. Here are 
two different cheeses — one that you can make with basic home ingredients 
and another that requires cheese culture and rennet. Both are easy to make. 
I also give you a recipe for yogurt, which is another simple way to break into 
using your goat milk.
You need the following equipment and supplies to make cheese:
 
✓ 2 or 3 gallon stainless steel pot (never use aluminum).
 
✓ Cheese cloth: Buy it at a cheese supply company or as cotton muslin by 
the yard at a fabric store. Don’t use the cheesecloth sold at the grocery 
store; the weave isn’t fine enough.
 
✓ A stainless steel colander.
 
✓ A twist tie, rubber band, string, or shoelace to secure the cheese you are 
hanging to drain.
 
✓ A cooking thermometer with a temperature range of 0° to 212° 
Fahrenheit.
 
✓ A large spoon.
 
✓ A long knife for cutting the curds.

312
Raising Goats For Dummies 
 1 Warm milk to 86° Fahrenheit and stir in mesophilic culture. Let the mixture ripen for 
one hour.
 2 Mix rennet into cool water and stir into milk. Cover and allow the mixture to set for 
another hour to coagulate. 
 3 Cut curds into 1⁄2-inch cubes and then allow it to rest five minutes.
 
 To cut the curd, use a knife that reaches the bottom of the pot. Slice across the cheese 
in lines from left to right. Turn the pot 90 ° and cut across the previous cuts. Then slice 
at an angle through the cheese at half- inch intervals until the cheese is cut into cubes.
 4 Stir gently for 15 minutes, keeping the curds at 86° Fahrenheit. Cut any pieces that were 
missed so that pieces are uniform in size.
 5 Pour curds into a cheesecloth-lined colander. You can save the whey for ricotta cheese 
or give to chickens, pigs, or dogs.
 6 Tie the bag of curds and hang to drain for four to six hours or overnight. 
 7 Remove cheese from cheesecloth, slice in half, and lay the cheese in a bowl.
 8 Salt all surfaces, cover with a plate or plastic wrap, and allow to set at room temperature 
for 24 hours. 
 
 During the 24 hours, intermittently drain whey that is expelled from the cheese and 
re-salt the cheese. 
 
Feta Cheese
The beauty of this cheese is that it is very forgiving — if you add the rennet late, cut the 
curds late, or let it hang or expel whey for a longer time than the recipe calls for, it will 
still turn out fine. You also cannot oversalt it because it is a salty cheese and the salt 
helps remove the whey.
Preparation time: About 10 minutes
Cook time: 75 minutes, plus about 32 hours’ hanging time 
Yield: 2 pounds
2 gallons goat milk
1⁄4 teaspoon mesophilic culture (a culture that 
is destroyed at higher temperatures). You can 
get this at a cheese supply store
1⁄4 teaspoon liquid vegetable rennet or 1⁄2 
rennet tablet. (Get it at a cheese supply store.)
1⁄4 cup cool water 
Kosher or any non-iodized salt

Simple Cheese
This straightforward recipe is a good place to start your goat-milk recipe exploration.
Preparation time: 15 min
Cook time: 15 minutes, plus about 3 hours of hanging time
Yield: Approximately1 pound cheese 
1 gallon goat milk (never use ultrapastuerized 
milk from the store because it will not turn into 
cheese)
1⁄4 cup vinegar or lemon juice
Kosher or any non-iodized salt, to taste
 1 Slowly heat the milk to 195° Fahrenheit.
 2 Stir in the vinegar and keep the milk at 195° Fahrenheit, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 
15 minutes. The milk will gradually start to curdle, first with very small curds and then 
larger. When the curds stay separate from the milk when you stir, they’re ready.
 3 When a soft curd has formed, pour into a cheesecloth-lined colander.
 4 Sprinkle salt, according to taste, over the curd, then remove cheese in cheesecloth and 
hang to drain for several hours.
When the cheese reaches the desired consistency, add whatever ingredients you like to 
flavor it, such as salt, herbs, or even fruit and powdered sugar to taste, and refrigerate. The 
cheese keeps for about a week.

Drinks
I’m a big fan of drinking goat milk straight, but you also can turn it into 
tasty beverages like koumiss, a fermented, carbonated dairy drink that was 
traditionally made from mares’ milk in central Asia.
 
Yogurt
Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains friendly bacteria to aid the digestive 
system. It is good for goat owners and their goats. If you have a goat on antibiotics for 
any reason and you don’t have a probiotic on hand, give it a couple tablespoons of 
yogurt to replace the good bacteria that the antibiotic kills.
Homemade goat milk yogurt doesn’t turn out as thick as the grocery-store yogurt you’re 
used to, so don’t be put off thinking you made a mistake. It makes great smoothies!
Follow these steps in the evening for yogurt the next morning.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Setting time: 8 hours
Yield: 2 quarts
A half gallon of goat milk
1 to 2 tablespoons plain yogurt

Koumiss
Koumiss has been used medicinally in various times, and depending on the level of 
fermentation can contain varying degrees of alcohol. This version uses yeast to start 
the fermentation. 
Before you start, sanitize everything that will contact the drink mixture, using one 
tablespoon of bleach to one gallon of water. Soak bottles, containers, and utensils for 
15 minutes, rinse in hot water making sure to remove all traces of bleach.
Preparation time: 30 min (plus 24 hours sit time and 24 hours storing time before 
refrigeration)
Cook time: 30 minutes 
Yield: About 1 gallon
One gallon goat milk
2 tablespoons honey
1⁄8 teaspoon champagne yeast
1/4 cup water
 1 Heat one gallon goat milk to 180° Fahrenheit in a stainless steel pot and remove any film 
that forms.
 2 Add 2 tablespoons honey and allow the mixture to cool to 70° Fahrenheit.
 3 Dissolve 1⁄8 teaspoon of champagne yeast (you can buy this at a beer makers shop) in 1⁄4 
cup 115° Fahrenheit water and let it stand for 10 minutes.
 4 Stir yeast mixture into the milk. Cover with a clean cloth and allow to stand at room 
temp until it foams (about 24 hours). 
 5 Pour koumiss into sanitized beer bottles that can withstand carbonation pressure. Fill 
only to 1 inch below the bottom of the neck of the bottle. 
 6 Store koumiss at room temperature for 24 hours, then refrigerate. Shake the bottles 
gently every few days but not just before opening.

Popovers
Savory popovers are great for breakfast or alongside dinner.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Bake time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 dozen
4 large eggs
2 cups flour
2 cups goat milk
1 teaspoon salt
 1 Preheat oven to 450° Fahrenheit.
 2 Grease a popover pan or muffin tin and dust it with flour so the batter will have 
something to climb as it rises.
 3 In a large bowl, beat eggs slightly with a wire whisk.
 4 Add milk, flour, and salt and beat until smooth. Do not overbeat.
 5 Fill muffin cups two-thirds full. 
 6 Bake for 20 minutes and then lower oven temperature to 350° Fahrenheit. 
 7 Bake until the popovers are well-browned and crusty, about 10 minutes longer. 
(If the popovers aren’t brown enough, they collapse when they cool.)
 8 Remove from oven and serve immediately.
Note: Avoid opening the oven until the last five minutes to prevent popovers from 
deflating.
