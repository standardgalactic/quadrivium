Flex sensor 
A ﬂex sensor is a device made of a thin, ﬂexible 
material of which the resistance changes (it increases) 
as it ﬂexes. Hence, its name. 
You can use these sensors to detect stress in machines 
or structures, but also in things like this "power glove": 
There's lots of other uses, like in biometrics, in ﬁtness products, and in gaming devices. 
Let's have a look at the ﬂex sensor in action.

Assembly 
This is what we are going to build: 
You will need: 
• The Arduino 
• A ﬂex sensor (you can get one from Sparkfun 
for around $12) 
• A 1kΩ resistor (to build a voltage divider) 
• Three jumper wires. 
Here’s the completed circuit:

Sketch 
And, here's the script. All we need to do is to read the voltage at analog pin 0 and print it in 
the monitor. 
void setup() { 
 
// initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second: 
 
Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
// the loop routine runs over and over again forever: 
void loop() { 
 
// read the input on analog pin 0: 
 
int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); 
 
// Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023)  
 
//to a voltage (0 - 5V): 
 
float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); 
 
// print out the value you read: 
 
Serial.println(voltage); 
} 
Upload it to your Arduino and open up the monitor. Bend the sensor back and forth. See 
how the output ﬂuctuates as the sensor's shape changes? 
What's inside a ﬂex sensor? 
A ﬂex sensor is made of carbon resistive elements surrounded by a plastic ﬂexible 
protective cover. As the elements are bend, their resistance increases as a function of its 
radius because the resistive material becomes slightly thinner. In eﬀect, when the material 
becomes thinner, there is less carbon to conduct electricity, therefore the resistance 
increases.
