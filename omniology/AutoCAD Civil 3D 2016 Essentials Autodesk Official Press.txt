Acknowledgments
What an amazing year it has been! I get to continue writing this series and 
updating it for yet another great release of Autodesk® AutoCAD® Civil 3D® soft-
ware. And after a wonderful 16 months on the Premium Support Services team 
at Autodesk, I have changed roles and I’m now serving as Community Evangelist 
for InfraWorks® 360. This new role gives me the opportunity to focus on reach-
ing the Autodesk infrastructure software (including InfraWorks, Civil 3D, and 
others) community and try to be a positive force to inform and enable this great 
group of people.
In addition, I will be updating the entire InfraWorks 360 series of books to 
address all the exciting changes there. These are certainly exciting times to be 
involved in the civil/infrastructure design industry and to be using Autodesk 
products. I’m blessed to be in such a wonderful position to observe and participate 
in the transformation that is taking place. For years, we have been talking about 
3D and BIM in the civil/infrastructure industry and now we’re finally putting our 
money where our mouths are. There will be big changes over the next few years, so 
invest in yourself through training and learning, and hold on and enjoy the ride! 
I’ve said it before on past books and I’ll say it again on this one: This book was a 
team effort. Kudos to Stephanie McComb for getting the book off the ground and 
for keeping it moving along throughout the process. Thanks to the wonderful 
editors, Christine O’Connor and Kathryn Duggan, for correcting all my mistakes 
(there were many) and making the book hold up to the high standard of quality 
that is characteristic of Wiley/Sybex. It was an honor to once again work with 
my good friend Joshua Modglin and to know that, as technical editor, he had my 
back on the technical aspects of the book.
And as always, thanks to my wife, Dixie, and my four children for enduring yet 
another “book season” and all of the not-so-fun stuff that comes with it. I love 
you all, and I do it all for you.

Introduction
When the first version of this book was born just over four years ago, my hope 
was for it to be one book in a long and successful series that would educate, inspire, 
and even excite many people about using the Autodesk® AutoCAD® Civil 3D® soft-
ware. In order to make that happen, I decided that each book in the series had to 
meet the following criteria:
▶
▶It should be basic enough to enable anyone to learn Civil 3D.
▶
▶It should be in-depth enough to enable a person to be productive 
using Civil 3D for basic tasks.
▶
▶It should foster understanding by associating the things you do in 
Civil 3D with familiar things you see every day.
▶
▶The examples and exercises should be based on the real world.
▶
▶The book should not simply demonstrate random software features 
but should also teach the process of project completion using Civil 3D.
Since the first version of the book was released, I have received tons of great 
feedback about how well this book functions in many learning environments. I 
have also used the book myself to teach classes in a corporate environment, and 
I am very pleased with how it performs. I am confident that the goals I listed 
have been met, and for that reason I have held to the same writing style, format, 
and delivery that proved to be so successful in the previous versions.
As you work your way through the book as a teacher, a student, or an end 
user, you’ll find that the first two chapters, although very important, are more 
general and introductory. After that, you’re going to take a journey through the 
completion of a residential land development project—start to finish. In fact, the 
example project is based on a residential development that was built about 10 
years ago, not far from my home. The topics are presented as though you have 
never touched a CAD program before, and wherever possible, there are sidebars 
and other forms of augmentation that relate what you’re doing to the real world.
You’ll also find that as I wrote this book, I tried to sympathize with future 
readers by thinking back to my college days when I was learning about survey-
ing and civil engineering for the first time. There were many times when I felt 
frustrated and lost because I was learning new and foreign concepts and did not 
see how they related to the real world. I can remember being out in the field dur-
ing my surveying class—looking through the survey instrument, writing down 
measurements, and having no idea why. That wasn’t an enjoyable feeling, and it 

	
I nt r o d u c t i o n 	
x i i i
isn’t one I want you to experience as you learn the new and foreign concepts in 
this book. Eventually I learned all about surveying, and now I have an in-depth 
understanding of how those measurements relate to designing and building 
roads, buildings, and other things—but it took many years. It’s my sincerest 
hope that this book gives you a head start on some of those types of concepts 
while at the same time relating them to Civil 3D in ways that hit home for you.
What’s New in This Book?
If you already own AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 Essentials, you’ll be happy to know 
that AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016 Essentials has been updated to address important 
changes in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016. All applicable images have been updated 
in this version of the book to account for changes to the user interface and 
changes to functionality.  The dataset files have also been updated to ensure 
compatibility with AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016.
Who Should Read This Book?
This book should be read by anyone who needs or wants to begin learning 
AutoCAD Civil 3D. It’s appropriate for ages ranging from high school to retire-
ment, and although it’s intended for those who have no experience or skill with 
Civil 3D, it can also serve as a great resource for refreshing your knowledge base 
or filling in any gaps. In addition, this book can be used as a resource for  
preparing to take the AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016 Certified Professional exam. See 
www.autodesk.com/certification for more certification information and 
resources. You can also refer to this book’s appendix to see which certification 
topics are covered and where they can be found in the book. 
In addition to those pursuing a certification, here are some specific examples 
of individuals who would benefit from reading this book:

What You Will Learn
This book covers the basic skills and concepts needed to begin using Civil 3D to 
design land development projects. The concepts include those related to Civil 3D 
as well as those related to civil engineering and surveying in general. It doesn’t 
cover all topics or all Civil 3D features, but it provides a solid foundation you 
can use to perform basic tasks. This foundation can then serve as a stepping-off 
point as you learn more advanced skills and work toward an in-depth under-
standing of Civil 3D.
The first two chapters will give you a basic understanding of Civil 3D and help 
you to understand and appreciate how it “thinks.” The remaining 16 chapters 
will teach you how to use the tools that Civil 3D provides to complete a typical 
land development design project.
What You Need
Specific hardware requirements for running AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016 had  
not been released as this book went to press. See the Autodesk website  
(www.autodesk.com) for current requirements.
To perform the exercises in this book, you must have AutoCAD Civil 3D 2016 
installed on your computer. It’s recommended that you use the default software 
setup with two exceptions: Change your drawing screen color to white, and dock 
the command line at the bottom of the screen. This book contains many screen 
captures of Civil 3D drawings, which were all produced with these distinctive 
changes to the user interface. Also, at times, the exercises refer to drawing enti-
ties by color, which is sometimes dependent on the background color.
To complete the exercises, you’ll need to download the necessary files from 
www.sybex.com/go/civil3d2016essentials. Here you’ll find a list of Zip files, 
one for each chapter. When you unzip the file for the first chapter to the local C: 
drive of your computer, a folder named Civil 3D 2016 Essentials will be cre-
ated with the chapter folder inside it. As you unzip additional chapter files to the 
local simply merge the new Civil 3D 2016 Essentials folder into the old one. 
The resulting files and folders will appear similar to the following image:

	
I nt r o d u c t i o n 	
x v
Zip files are available in imperial and metric units. As you complete the exer-
cises, metric values will be shown in parentheses. The imperial and metric 
values for a given item usually are not equivalent, to avoid using irregular val-
ues for the design. For example, the value for the width of a sidewalk would be 
shown as 3’ (1m) even though 3’ doesn’t exactly equal 1m.
Finally, be sure to check the book’s website for any updates to this 
book should the need arise. You can also contact me directly by email at 
CivilEssentials@gmail.com or visit my blog at http://ericchappell 
.blogspot.com to read even more about the book and Civil 3D in general.

Chapter 1
Navigating the  
User Interface
If you’re new to the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software environment, then 
your first experience has probably been a lot like staring at the instrument 
panel of an airplane. Civil 3D can be quite intimidating, with lots of buttons, 
strange shapes, and unusual icons—all packed into a relatively small area. In 
addition, you may be even more intimidated by the feeling that there is a lot 
of power under the hood.
This leads us to our main objective for this chapter, which is to alleviate 
that feeling of intimidation and make you feel much more at ease within the 
Civil 3D environment. Let me start you down that path by saying that there’s 
a big difference between an airplane and Civil 3D. In Civil 3D, if you really 
mess up, you can simply close the drawing file without saving. When piloting 
an airplane, it’s a little more difficult to undo your mistakes.
After completing this chapter, you will have achieved a greater comfort 
level within the Civil 3D environment by being able to identify the main user 
interface components and utilize them for basic functions. You will also be 
able to use two specific features that will serve you well throughout the pro-
gram: the Transparent Commands toolbar and the Inquiry Tool.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Navigate the Civil 3D user interface
▶
▶Launch general commands through the application menu
▶
▶Launch key software commands and functions using the ribbon
▶
▶Navigate the design contents using the Toolspace
▶
▶Navigate the model using the drawing area
▶
▶Communicate with Civil 3D using the command line
▶
▶Access and modify design information using Panorama

Getting to Know the Civil 3D User Interface
To begin learning about the Civil 3D environment, let’s take our airplane anal-
ogy down a notch and think about this as learning to drive an automobile. When 
your parents first sat you down at the wheel and talked about the car’s controls, 
they probably didn’t mention the air conditioning or the radio. Those, of course, 
are important parts of the driving experience, but I’m betting they started with 
the most important parts, such as the steering wheel, the gas pedal, and, most 
important of all, the brake pedal. We’re going to approach your first experience 
with “driving” Civil 3D in much the same manner.
There are many, many parts to the Civil 3D user interface. For the purpose of this 
book, I’ll cover just the ones that will be most important in enabling you to navigate 
the software effectively. Figure 1.1 shows the major components of the user interface.

Exercise 1.1: Use the Application Menu to  
Open a File
In this exercise, you will use the application menu to open a file.
	
1.	 Launch Civil 3D by double-clicking the Civil 3D 2016 Imperial 
(Metric) icon on the desktop of your computer.
	 2.	 Click the application menu icon.
	 3.	 On the application menu, click Open.
	 4.	 Browse to the Chapter 01 class data folder, and open User Interface.dwg.
	
5.	 Open the application menu once more, and investigate the commands 
that are listed there. You’ll notice that most of them have to do with 
creating, opening, saving, and printing drawing files.
	
6.	 Keep this drawing open for the next exercise.
Because nothing changes in this drawing file as a result of the exercise steps, 
no User Interface – Complete file is necessary. 
It’s All in How You Look at It
This drawing, like many other drawings you’ll open while working through this 
book, is set up with three viewports. The one on the left is top-down, or plan 
view, showing the entire project. The one at the top right is also plan view, but 
it is zoomed in to a different part of the drawing. The lower-right viewport is a 
3D view. These are three views of the same design, and what happens in one will 
happen in the other two. Think of it as three cameras showing three different 
viewpoints of the same subject, with each viewport being like a television monitor.

done so, download

Working with the Ribbon
The ribbon is located at the top of your screen, and it is the launching pad 
for most of your Civil 3D commands. The commands that it contains are 
organized into groups through the use of tabs and panels. The ribbon itself is 
divided into a series of tabs that include Home, Insert, Annotate, and so on, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.3.
F i g u r e   1 . 3    Tabs arrange large numbers of similar Civil 3D commands into groups.
Each tab is divided into panels. For instance, the Home tab shown in 
Figure 1.4 includes the Palettes, Create Ground Data, Create Design, Profile & 
Section Views, and Draw panels.
F i g u r e   1 . 4    Panels provide another level of grouping within a ribbon tab.
Because Civil 3D groups the commands in this way, you never have to choose 
from more than a handful of commands once you’ve taken your best guess at 
the correct tab and panel. Also, you’ll find that the more you use Civil 3D, the 
better you will get at knowing the location of the commands. It’s not so much 
memorizing their positions as it is learning how Civil 3D “thinks”—that is, the 
way in which it relates commands to one another and categorizes them into 
tabs and panels.
One other thing you should know is that most panels expand downward to 
show you the less frequently used commands in a particular category. You’ll 
know that a panel expands when you see a downward-pointing white triangle 
next to its name. For example, Figure 1.5 shows the Home tab’s Create Design 
panel expanded with more commands. Don’t forget to look on these hidden pan-
els when searching for commands.

6  
C h ap t e r 1  • N av i g a t i n g  t h e U s e r I nt e r f a c e 
F i g u r e   1 . 5    Most panels expand downward to reveal more commands, as is the case with the 
Create Design panel on the Home tab of the ribbon.
One of the best features of the ribbon is its ability to respond to what you 
select in the drawing area. For example, if you click a Civil 3D alignment, the 
ribbon changes and serves up alignment-related commands on a special tab. 
The same is true for surfaces, parcels, and so on. These special tabs are referred 
to as contextual ribbon tabs. They are a huge help when you’re first learning 
Civil 3D and a huge time-saver even after you’ve become a master.
Another Great Way to Find Commands
Sometimes you really have no idea where to even begin looking for a com-
mand. The application menu has a handy tool that will help you find just about 
any command, regardless of where it is in the user interface. Simply click the 
application menu and type a keyword in the search bar. You’ll be given a list of 
commands that match your keyword. You can launch a command right from the 
list by clicking it, or you can learn where the command is located by looking at 
the information shown to the right of it.

Exercise 1.2: Use the Ribbon to Launch 
Commands
In this exercise, you will familiarize yourself with the ribbon’s tabs and panels.
	
1.	 Launch Civil 3D 2016, and open the file named User Interface.dwg.
	
2.	 Click the Home tab of the ribbon to bring it to the forefront (it may 
be there already).
	
3.	 Click the downward-pointing white triangle at the bottom of the 
Create Design panel and note how it expands down, as shown previ-
ously in Figure 1.5.
	
4.	 Click the Insert tab of the ribbon. Here, you see words like insert, 
import, and attach, which are all ways of bringing information into 
the drawing.
	
5.	 Click the other tabs of the ribbon, and see whether you can relate 
some of the words you see in the commands to the title of each rib-
bon tab.
	
6.	 Place your cursor in the left viewport, and roll the mouse wheel 
forward to zoom in to the drawing. Keep zooming in until you can 
clearly see the road centerlines labeled with stationing numbers 
(these are Civil 3D alignments). Click one of the road centerlines, and 
note that the ribbon displays a contextual tab to make alignment 
commands accessible (see Figure 1.6).
F i g u r e   1 . 6    The ribbon displays the contextual Alignment: Main Road A tab because an 
alignment has been selected in the drawing (the name of the tab you see may be slightly different 
depending on which alignment you selected).

Working with the Toolspace
Think of the Toolspace as the Civil 3D “command center” where all Civil 3D 
data and settings are laid out in a nice, orderly arrangement. It has several main 
functions that are represented by the different tabs it can contain. Altogether, 
the Toolspace can house four tabs: Prospector, Settings, Survey, and Toolbox.
Prospector Tab
Prospector is arguably the most important part of the Civil 3D user interface. 
As you build your design, Prospector arranges the different components of your 
design in a tree structure (see Figure 1.7). Why a tree structure and not just a 
list of items? Later in this book, you’ll study how Civil 3D creates relationships 
between different parts of your design. In some ways, this tree structure helps 
represent some of those relationships as a hierarchy. Another, more practical 
reason for a tree structure is that it’s an efficient way to show a long list of items 
in a relatively small area—the branches of the tree can be collapsed to make 
room to expand other branches.

Another way to think about Prospector is that it arranges your design cat-
egorically rather than spatially. In other words, in your drawing area, you might 
see road centerlines crossing through parcels, which cross through contours, 
which cross through survey points. Everything is in the right place spatially, but 
from an organizational standpoint, it’s kind of a mess. Prospector sorts out this 
mess and puts all the points in one place, all the parcels in one place, and so 
on. Prospector also knows exactly where those objects are in the drawing. You 
can right-click an object in Prospector and use the Select command or Zoom To 
command to locate that object within the drawing.
Exercise 1.3: Explore the Model with the 
Prospector Tab
In this exercise you will use the Prospector tab of the Toolspace to explore  
the model.
	
1.	 Launch Civil 3D 2016, and open the file named User Interface.dwg.
	
2.	 If the Toolspace is not already open, click Toolspace on the Home tab 
of the ribbon.
	
3.	 Click the Prospector tab of the Toolspace to bring it to the forefront.
	
4.	 Explore the tree structure of Prospector by clicking the plus signs to 
expand the different branches.
	
5.	 Expand Alignments ➢ Centerline Alignments ➢ Main Road A ➢ 
Profiles. This hierarchical arrangement provides effective organi-
zation and suggests a relationship between the alignment and its 
profiles.
	
6.	 Click within the left viewport to activate it. Then, on the 
Prospector tab, right-click Side Road B, and select Zoom To. 
Notice how Prospector knows the location of the alignment 
named Side Road B, even if you don’t.
	
7.	 Keep this drawing open for the next exercise.
Because nothing changes in this drawing file as a result of the exercise steps, 
no User Interface – Complete file is necessary.
It’s important to point out that Prospector isn’t just a place for viewing your 
design; it’s also a place where you can change the appearance of your design,

of functions are accessed through contextual menus such as the one used in 
step 6 of Exercise 1.3. A good rule of thumb when using Prospector is, “When in 
doubt, right-click it.”
Settings Tab
Civil 3D has a lot of settings that control nearly every aspect of how the software 
behaves. In fact, one of the things that makes Civil 3D so powerful is that you 
can customize its settings to accommodate nearly any type of design, any com-
pany standard, or any other factor that defines the environment within which 
you use it. The Settings tab is where these settings are managed; however, you 
won’t be spending much time here in the early part of your Civil 3D career. This 
area is more often the territory of a CAD manager or Civil 3D guru.
Exercise 1.4: Explore the Drawing Settings with 
the Settings Tab
In this exercise, you will use the Settings tab of the Toolspace to explore the

Survey Tab
The Survey tab is specifically designed for working with survey data. You could 
call it “Prospector for surveyors” because it serves the same functions and works 
in much the same way as the Prospector tab. It displays survey data in a tree 
structure, and it allows you to launch commands through contextual menus.
Toolbox Tab
As if Civil 3D didn’t have enough stuff packed into it already, the Toolbox is a 
place where other add-ons can be plugged in. Your company may have some 
custom programming that is designed to run in Civil 3D, or you may have some 
add-on modules provided by Autodesk. This is the place where you can load and 
run these additional enhancements to Civil 3D.
Using the Drawing Area
The drawing area is where you can actually see and “touch” the design model you 
are creating. The design model is most often viewed from above, referred to as plan 
view, but it can be viewed from any perspective. For example, because Civil 3D spe-
cializes in representing designs as 3D models, you may want to display your model 
using a 3D view. Figure 1.8 shows a model in both plan and 3D views.

Using the Command Line
Think of the command line (see Figure 1.9) as a “chat window” where you talk 
with Civil 3D. Nearly everything you do is reported on the command line along 
with the response from Civil 3D. A response can be a request for more informa-
tion, report of a result, or notification of a problem. It’s good to get into the habit 
of always watching the command line, because it often tells you what to do next. 
You can also launch commands from the command line, but you will likely find 
it much easier to use the visual interface provided by the ribbon and other tools.
F i g u r e   1 . 9    A view of the command line while a transparent command (covered later in this 
chapter) is used to draw a line. Notice how the command line reports that the LINE command has 
been started and then prompts for the first piece of information: the “first point.”
Using Panorama
Panorama is a multipurpose window that is used to show and/or modify many 
different types of information. It works by displaying a tab for the information 
that you or the program has called for. For example, the Events tab (also known 
as the Event Viewer) shows up when Civil 3D needs to tell you something about 
the drawing. In another example, if you launch the command to edit the geo-
metric details of an alignment, the Alignment Entities tab appears. As shown in 
Figure 1.10, while Panorama displays information for one task, it also displays 
tabs for other tasks that you can access with a single click. This enables you to 
multitask within the same window.

Using the Transparent Commands Toolbar
As you may already know, civil engineers and surveyors draw things a little dif-
ferently than architects or mechanical engineers. They use things such as bear-
ings, curve deltas, northings, and eastings to define geometry. The Transparent 
Commands toolbar enables Civil 3D users to draw things based on the special 
geometric concepts that are unique to civil engineers and surveyors.
For example, when drawing a line, you can use the Northing Easting trans-
parent command to specify the first point and the Bearing Distance transparent 
command to specify the endpoint (see Figure 1.11).

Exercise 1.6: Use Transparent Commands to 
Draw Like a Civil Engineer
In this exercise, you will use one of the Transparent Commands to draw a line 
by bearing and distance.
	
1.	 Launch Civil 3D 2016, and open the file named Line By Bearing.dwg.
	
2.	 Click the Type a command prompt on the command line. Type LINE, 
and press Enter.
	
3.	 When prompted to specify the first point, click a point near the center 
of the screen.
	
4.	 When prompted to specify the next point, click Bearing Distance on the 
Transparent Commands toolbar. Refer to Figure 1.11 for the location of 
this command.
	
5.	 When prompted for a quadrant, either type 1 and press Enter or click 
in the upper-right quadrant created by the crosshairs on the screen.
	
6.	 When prompted for the bearing, type 45 and press Enter.
	
7.	 When prompted for the distance, type 500 (150) and press Enter. 
Press Esc twice to exit the command. You have just drawn a line that 
is 500 feet (150 meters) long at a bearing of N 45° E.
	
8.	 Save and close the drawing.

Using the Inquiry Tool
Most of the time, you’ll be the one providing the information for a drawing. 
Sometimes, however, you need your drawing to tell you something. That’s 
where the Inquiry Tool comes in. The Inquiry Tool is a separate window whose 
sole purpose is to give you information about things in the drawing. There is a 
long list of drawing items from which to choose, and beneath each item is a list 
of things that you can ask about (see Figure 1.12).

Another Civil 3D feature that enables you to draw like a surveyor or civil engineer 
is a set of specialized line and curve commands. These commands are mixed in 
with the basic AutoCAD line and curve commands on the Draw panel of the rib-
bon. You can find specialized line commands by expanding the Line icon to reveal 
commands like Create Line By Bearing, Create Line By Point # Range, and so on. 
There is also a Curves icon that expands to reveal commands like Create Curve 
Through Point and Create Multiple Curves. Finally, the Best Fit icon expands to 
include commands for best-fit lines and curves. The following image shows the

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you are more comfortable in the Civil 3D user 
interface and can begin navigating it to get where you need to go. You understand how to 
use the application menu to access files and do other general tasks. You can use the ribbon to 
access Civil 3D commands and the Toolspace to explore the model contents and the drawing 
settings. You understand where Panorama fits in to the overall user interface makeup. You can 
use transparent commands to perform basic drafting using terms and geometric concepts that 
are unique to those working in the civil engineering and surveying fields. Finally, you can use 
the Inquiry Tool to answer questions about your design.
Now that you have a feel for the Civil 3D user interface, you are ready to move on in your learn-
ing experience. Next you will study the nature of the Civil 3D environment in all its dynamic 3D 
glory, and you will begin to build and create a design, learning new tools and concepts as you go.

Chapter 2
Leveraging a Dynamic 
Environment
Let’s switch back to the airplane analogy again. So far we’ve sat down in 
the cockpit and talked about the most important gauges and controls. In 
several cases, we’ve even pushed a few buttons and looked behind a few hid-
den panels. You now have a greater familiarity with the user interface.
In this chapter, we’re going to take the plane for a ride and observe and 
discuss how it works. How does it turn? How fast can it go? And, most 
important, how do the parts work together? You won’t be able to fly solo 
after completing this chapter, but you will gain the experience of applying 
specific instructions, producing specific results, and discussing those results.
How does this translate to the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software? Civil 3D has 
a unique, dynamic environment that is all about leveraging interactions and 
relationships. If you capitalize on this while you’re working with Civil 3D, 
you will be much more productive and efficient. After completing this chap-
ter, you will understand the dynamic capabilities of the Civil 3D environment 
and the importance of taking advantage of those capabilities.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Understand and leverage the connection between objects and styles
▶
▶Understand the connection between labels and label styles
▶
▶Understand the connection between objects
▶
▶Understand the connection between objects and labels
▶
▶Appreciate the richness of the 3D model

Connecting Objects and Styles
The word object is usually considered pretty generic, but in the world of Civil 3D 
it means something very specific. A Civil 3D object is an intelligent piece of your 
design model that stores information about itself and has the ability to interact 
with other objects in the drawing. Another characteristic of a Civil 3D object is 
that it is affected by a Civil 3D style. A Civil 3D style is a collection of settings 
that control the appearance and behavior of a Civil 3D object.
The relationship between objects and styles is one of several key relationships 
that you must understand and be able to take advantage of when using Civil 3D. 
Here are a few examples of Civil 3D objects that you’ll encounter in this book as 
well as in a production environment:
Surface    A 3-D model typically used to represent the shape of the ground, 
either existing or proposed
Alignment    A series of 2-D lines, arcs, and spirals typically used to represent a 
linear feature such as a road centerline
Profile    A series of lines and curves that represent changes in elevation along 
an alignment

Recap of Important Definitions
A Civil 3D object is an intelligent piece of your design model that stores informa-
tion about itself and has the ability to interact with other objects in the drawing.
A Civil 3D style is a collection of settings that control the appearance and behavior 
of a Civil 3D object.
What Is Elevation?
Depending on where you are in your civil engineering or surveying learning 
experience, the term elevation may be foreign to you. One way to visualize this 
concept is to think of it in terms of a piece of grid paper laid out over an area of 
land with the horizontal lines running west to east and the vertical lines run-
ning south to north. Elevation would be coming straight up out of the paper. 
So, the top of a hill would have a greater elevation than the bottom of a ravine. 
Another way of thinking about this is in terms of an XYZ coordinate system. X and 
Y would be the lines on the grid paper, and Z (elevation) would be coming out of 
it. Because Civil 3D combines general AutoCAD® software and civil engineering 
commands, elevation and the z-axis are the same.
One more thing—depending on where you live in the world, it may be appropri-
ate to use the word level instead of elevation.

C h ap t e r 2  • L e v e r a g i n g  a  D y n a m i c E nv i r o nm e nt
Each of the objects listed previously can be controlled by styles. For example, 
surface styles can be used to show a surface in many forms, including contour 
lines, a 3-D grid, a series of arrows pointing downhill, shading representing dif-
ferent elevation ranges, and more (see Figure 2.1). In addition to changing the 
overall appearance of an object, styles can control specific details that differ 
slightly between similar configurations. For example, in one case there may be 
surface contours that need to be shown on an existing layer, whereas in another 
case the same contours are shown on a proposed layer (see Figure 2.2). The 
configuration is the same (contours), but the way that configuration is displayed 
(which layer) is different between two different styles.
F i g u r e   2 . 1    The same surface is shown in four different configurations using four different 
styles (from left to right): contours, elevation banding, TIN lines and contours, and slope arrows. 
F i g u r e   2 . 2    The contours on the left are displayed using proposed layers that are typically 
darker and more prominent. The contours on the right are displayed using existing layers that are 
typically lighter, so they appear more as background information.

Exercise 2.1: Apply Styles to Objects
In this exercise, you will use styles to change the appearance and behavior of 
Civil 3D objects.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Objects and Styles.dwg located in the 
Chapter 02 class data folder. 
The plan view of the surface in the left viewport should appear 
similar to the first image shown in Figure 2.1.
	
2.	 Click one of the contour lines in the drawing to select the surface 
object.
	
3.	 If the Properties palette is not visible, click Properties on the 
Home tab of the ribbon.
	
4.	 In the Properties window, change the Style property to Elevation 
Banding (2D). 
The surface will display as colored bands, representing different 
ranges of elevations, similar to the second image in Figure 2.1.
	
5.	 Change the Style property to Contours & Triangles. 
The surface should now appear similar to the third image in 
Figure 2.1. The triangles are the fundamental framework of the sur-
face and give it the shape that it has.
	
6.	 Change the Style property to Contours 1' and 5' (Design) (0.5 m and 
2.5 m (Design)). 
The surface should now resemble the left image in Figure 2.2.
	
7.	 Change the Style property to Contours 1' and 5' (Background) (0.5 m 
and 2.5 m (Background)).

What Are Contours?
Contours are lines that are used to represent topography or changes in elevation 
across the ground. Most people experience contours in things like trail maps that 
cover a large area (square miles or square kilometers) in comparison to what we 
typically see in Civil 3D. By definition, contours are lines that connect points of 
equal elevation. If you took a giant horizontal blade and passed it through the 
ground at equal elevation intervals, you would get contour lines. In flat areas, 
the lines would be far apart, and in steep areas, the lines would be close together. 
With practice, you can look at a contour map and visualize the 3D shape of the 
land that the map represents.

You can view the results of successfully completing this exercise by opening 
Objects and Styles - Complete.dwg.
As you worked through the previous exercise, did you notice that no extra 
steps were required to update or redraw the surface when a new style was 
assigned or the style was edited? The effect was immediate—as soon as you 
modified the assigned style or assigned a different style, the appearance of the 
surface changed. This is because of a dynamic relationship between the object 
and its style, a relationship that is honored throughout the software.

Editing a Style vs. Assigning a Different Style
In steps 4 through 7 of the previous exercise, you changed the appearance of the 
surface by assigning a different style to it. This is the way to do it 99 percent of 
the time. In steps 8 through 10, you edited the style that was already assigned 
to the surface. Editing styles is typically the responsibility of a CAD manager. In 
fact, in many companies, end users are not permitted to modify or create styles. 
However, it is still important to understand that when a style is modified, any 
object using that style will change its appearance or behavior to honor the new 
version of the style.
Connecting Labels and Label Styles
Labels are an important part of any design because they provide specific infor-
mation about the design that is often necessary for it to be properly constructed. 
Civil 3D enables you to create many different types of labels that associate them-
selves with the different types of Civil 3D objects. Labels are Civil 3D objects 
too, and just like the objects listed in the previous section, their appearance and 
behavior are controlled by styles. Also, just as with the relationship between 
objects and their styles, labels react when a different style is assigned or the 
assigned style is modified.
Here are some label types that correspond to the Civil 3D objects listed in the 
previous section:
Surface Spot Elevation Label    This type of label is typically used to display 
the elevation of a key point in the design, such as a low point that water will 
drain toward or a high point that water will drain away from.
Alignment Station Offset Label    This type of label is used to express the 
location of a feature in reference to a linear object. For example, you can express 
the location of a manhole by saying that it is a certain distance along the length 
of the road (station) and a certain distance to the left or right of it (offset).

Profile Grade Break Label    This type of label is used to show the location and 
elevation of a slope change along a profile. For example, if the profile slopes upward 
and then changes to a downward direction, the highest point where the change 
occurs is considered a grade break and is a common location to place a label.
Station and Offset
Long linear designs such as roads and pipelines often use station and offset 
notation to express locations. Stations themselves are usually expressed in a 
special notation that has a plus sign in it.
For example, if you’re working in imperial units, a station of 2+00 refers to a 
location that is 200 feet “down the road” (assuming the road begins at station 
0+00). To get to station 2+00, offset 12', you would travel down the road exactly 
200 feet, turn right exactly 90 degrees, and travel exactly 12 feet.
If you’re working in metric units, a common format is to use three digits after the 
plus sign. In this case, a station of 0+200 refers to a location 200 meters down 
the road. To get to station 0+200, offset 4 m, you would travel 200 meters down 
the road, turn right exactly 90 degrees, and travel exactly 4 meters.

Parcel Segment Label    This type of label is typically used to express geomet-
ric information about a line or curve that forms part of a legal boundary. For 
example, it is common to label the bearing and distance of a straight line seg-
ment along a property boundary.
Exercise 2.2: Apply Label Styles to Labels
In this exercise, you will use label styles to change the appearance and behavior 
of labels.

Styles and Company Standards
Civil 3D styles can make it easier for end users to meet company standards and can 
make graphical output more consistent. With a good set of styles that integrate 
company standards, all that an end user has to worry about is choosing the right 
style from a manageable list of choices. Conversely, if end users have to create 
their own styles, labels, and/or other graphical components, their drawings will 
most likely vary and may not comply with those standards.
Connecting Objects to Objects
The most important type of relationship that you’ll see in this chapter is the one 
between objects. A typical land development project is a collection of dozens of 
mini-designs that often tie in to one another. For example, a road is designed by 
first drawing the 2D path of its centerline, then the proposed changes in eleva-
tion along that centerline, and finally the lanes, curbs, and sidewalks extending 
outward from that centerline. To provide drainage during a rainstorm, ditches 
must be installed along the sides of the road. The location and depth of these 
ditches can be traced back through the design process the entire way to the 
layout of the road centerline. If the layout of the centerline needs to change for 
some reason, that change must propagate downstream through the design pro-
cess, ultimately changing the location and depth of one or more ditches.
Before Civil 3D, the many implications of such a change had to be addressed 
manually. An engineer or designer would have to inspect the road elevations, 
curbs, sidewalks, and ditches and manually address any changes required 
because of a change “upstream” in the design. With Civil 3D, you can build rela-
tionships between design objects and cause these changes to take place auto-
matically, saving time and money and reducing opportunity for human error.
Exercise 2.3: Explore Object Relationships
In this exercise, you will study how object relationships are leveraged to make 
design changes in a drawing.

2.	 Press the F3 key, and observe the command line. If it reports <Osnap 
On>, then press F3 again. If it reports <Osnap Off>, this is the correct 
condition for this exercise, and you can move on to the next step.
	
3.	 Click the top-right viewport, which shows a profile of the road 
design. The black lines represent the elevations along the centerline 
of the new road. The blue lines represent storm drains and pipes 
connecting them.
	
4.	 Click the black line representing the road profile. Zoom in until 
you can clearly see the triangular grip located at the intersection of 
two lines.
	
5.	 Click the triangular grip, and drag it upward to a location just below 
the top edge of the profile view grid, as shown in Figure 2.6.
Notice that the 3-D view (bottom-right) of the road automatically 
updates, including the height of the Inlet 2 drain. In the profile view 
(top-right), the top of the drain is elevated to match the road.

scenes. The following is a general account of the events that took place when 
you changed the location of the triangular grip:
▶
▶The slopes of the lines leading into that triangular grip were changed 
to match the new location of the grip.
▶
▶The parabolic curve geometry at the location of the grip was updated 
automatically.
▶
▶The corridor object, which represents a 3-D model of the road, 
was automatically rebuilt and updated to match the new profile 
geometry.
▶
▶A surface representing the pavement, concrete, and earthen embank-
ment elevations of the corridor was automatically rebuilt.
▶
▶The storm drain updated its top elevation to match the surface in the 
previous step.
▶
▶The 3-D representation of the storm drain was automatically updated 
(bottom-right view).
▶
▶The profile view representation of the storm drain was automatically 
updated (top-right view).
A simple grip edit triggered a chain of events that might have taken an hour 
or more to update manually. In addition to all this, other changes took place 
that did not affect the design of the storm drain. This is the power of the Civil 
3D dynamic environment. You should know, however, that the existence of 
these relationships is not necessarily automatic. They have to be considered and 
at times consciously built in to the design by the Civil 3D user.
Connecting Objects to Labels
There is also an important relationship between objects and labels. Labeling is 
one of the most time-consuming aspects of preparing a set of construction doc-
uments. Although it is a very important part of the process, it really has nothing 
to do with the design. Usually, labels are placed when the design is already com-
plete, as a means of communicating the necessary information for constructing 
the design in the field. The big advantage of the dynamic relationship between 
objects and labels is that it enables the user to create a single label that is valid 
for the life of the object. As the object changes, the label changes with it—so 
the label is always up to date and never has to be edited manually.

Exercise 2.4: Explore the Relationship Between 
Objects and Labels
In this exercise, you will study how dynamic labels respond when changes are 
made to the objects they annotate.
	
1.	 Open Objects and Labels.dwg located in the Chapter 02 class data 
folder. Notice the elevation label, which currently reads 190.02 (57.92).
	
2.	 Click one of the dark gray contour lines. On the ribbon, click Edit 
Surface ➢ Paste Surface.
	
3.	 Select Main Road A FG, and click OK. Press Esc to clear the selection.
In the top-right viewport, notice how the label updates and now 
reads 187.33 (57.07).
	
4.	 In the top-right viewport, pan southward and note the station value 
of 10+95.68 (0+333.96) and the offset value of 68.49L (20.88m L) in 
the label to the south of the spot elevation.
	
5.	 Click the road centerline to select it and display its grips. Then click 
the triangular grip and drag it west to a point near the west edge of 
the road, as shown in Figure 2.7.
F i g u r e   2 . 7    Grip-editing the alignment
After a pause while Civil 3D rebuilds several aspects of the design, 
the label updates once more. Because the road is no longer influenc-
ing the elevation of this spot, the label reverts to its original value of 
190.02 (57.92). The station offset label now displays updated values 
for station and offset.

Appreciating the Richness of the 3-D Model
Even though what you have done to this point may seem a bit foreign at the 
moment, at some point you will realize that all you’re doing with Civil 3D is cre-
ating instructions for how to build something. If you’ve ever assembled a piece 
of furniture or a bicycle that you bought at a store, you can relate to this con-
cept. The primary purpose of Civil 3D is to help you prepare the instructions for 
how to build a land development project.
Thirty years ago, the method used to prepare land development plans was 
relatively the same as it had been for hundreds of years: plans were drawn on 
paper, providing only a two-dimensional depiction of what was to be built. The 
information that existed for the design was limited to what could be displayed 
on paper. Then, with the advent of computers, something magical started to 
happen. Virtual versions of design components could be modeled electronically. 
They could be represented in all three dimensions and even have additional 
information attached to them. Now, instead of using an ink line on paper to 
represent a pipe, you could do it with a 3-D cylinder that also stored the pipe’s 
material, structural characteristics, and flow characteristics. This “smart” 
object could be ported to hydraulic design software for further analysis in con-
junction with local rainfall data to determine whether it was large enough to 
handle a storm with a specific likelihood of occurring within the life span of the 
pipe. And so on, and so on.
Thus, in 30 years we have progressed from ink on paper to 3-D intelligent 
objects. The step from drawing with a pen to drawing with a mouse came early 
in that evolution—not 3D or intelligent, but lines on a screen that could be 
printed. Civil 3D contains all the basic tools to represent designs in this manner, 
and unfortunately, many users create only basic 2-D drawings even though they 
have access to the dynamic 3-D environment that you’ve seen in this chapter. 
My sincere hope is that you will not be this type of end user but instead will 
squeeze every dynamic relationship possible into the models you build with Civil 
3D. You may not realize the full potential of the dynamic relationships you build 
until you have the opportunity to use them, but you can bet that they will pay 
dividends on every single project. The following are examples where it is essen-
tial to have a dynamic 3-D model.

3 2  
C h ap t e r 2  • L e v e r a g i n g  a  D y n a m i c E nv i r o nm e nt
Building Information Modeling
Building information modeling (BIM) has been a hot topic in the design, con-
struction, and facilities management fields for quite some time now. Although 
some would argue that Civil 3D has little to do with the B (building), it definitely 
has the I (information) and the M (modeling) aspects. Many civil engineering 
projects are incidental to building construction and therefore present an oppor-
tunity for Civil 3D models to be integrated with BIM. No model, no BIM.
GPS-Guided Machine Control
Imagine being able to download the instructions to assemble your bike and then 
upload them to your own personal robot, which would assemble the bike for 
you. That might sound like science fiction, but something similar is common 
practice in the land development industry. Models built with Civil 3D are being 
uploaded to GPS-guided earthmoving machines. These giant “robots” synchro-
nize GPS-based locations of themselves and their digging implements with the 
dimensions of the Civil 3D model until the real dirt and rock are a match to the 
model. Without a model, there is no GPS-guided machine control.
Construction Simulation
If you think about it, one thing that Civil 3D enables you to do is to simulate 
the project before having the contractor attempt to build it in the field. Why do 
this? It’s a lot cheaper to undo a CAD command than to undo the placement of 
several truckloads of concrete. Contractors are taking this one step further by 
simulating the construction itself. The sequence of operations, staging of mate-
rials, arrangement of equipment, and many other aspects can all be simulated 
with several products available on the market. These 4-D (3-D + time) or even 
5-D (3-D + time + cost) simulations are becoming commonplace in nearly all 
major construction projects. No model, no simulation.
Visualization
Visualization is itself a form of simulation. With design software now commonly 
producing 3-D models, the leap to 3-D visualization is much shorter and easier 
to accomplish than ever before. Clients, review agencies, and the public are 
beginning to expect renderings and even animations of proposed designs to be 
available for them to assess. No model, no visualization.
Building your designs as dynamic models does take a bit more effort and time, 
but as you develop more and more skills, the extra time and effort become a 

	
S h a r i n g D at a i n a D y n a m i c E nv i r o nm e nt 	
3 3
smaller fraction of the overall process. The resulting models are much more use-
ful, much more information rich, and much more valuable to your clients and 
the other parties involved in your projects. There’s no telling how this informa-
tion will be used, but one thing is for sure: It won’t be used at all if it’s not there.
In addition, building designs as dynamic models improves the quality and effi-
ciency of the design process. Designers who make full use of the dynamic model 
produce better designs by creating more design iterations and what-if scenarios 
than those who don’t. They can respond more quickly to design changes, reduc-
ing the overall cost involved in designing the project and increasing the bottom 
line. Leveraging the dynamic model isn’t just cool, it’s also practical and very 
smart from a business perspective.
Sharing Data in a Dynamic Environment
So far, you have studied many ways in which relationships and interactions are 
used to make Civil 3D a powerful design solution, but all these relationships 
have been confined to a single drawing or a single user. What happens in a team 
environment? Are there ways in which whole drawings can interact with one 
another? Can multiple team members establish dynamic relationships between 
their designs? The answer is yes, and the feature that makes it possible is the 
data shortcut.
Earlier, in the section “Connecting Objects to Objects,” you observed how a 
profile, a road design, and a pipe system design can be related to one another. 
Now, imagine a design team where Joe designs the profile in one drawing, Susan 
designs the road model in another drawing, and Jill designs the pipe system 
in yet another. Data shortcuts make it possible for these designs to be linked 
together just as you witnessed earlier—even across drawings.
A data shortcut is a link to a Civil 3D object that enables another drawing to 
get access to that object. For example, if you create a profile that represents the 
proposed centerline elevations of a road, you can publish a data shortcut for that 
profile, which makes that profile “visible” to other drawings. You or someone 
else can then open another drawing and use that data shortcut to access the 
profile. Once you have accessed the profile, you can use it as part of another 
design, such as the case with the road model.
When a data shortcut is created, it is displayed in Prospector beneath the 
Data Shortcuts heading (see Figure 2.8). Data shortcuts are stored within a 
data shortcuts projects folder. This enables related data shortcuts, such as those 
pertaining to a given project, to be grouped together in one location. The folder

Once a data shortcut is made available, you can use it to create a data reference

to them indicates that they are data references. In Figure 2.9, the Existing Ground

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand the dynamic environment of Civil 
3D. You comprehend how styles are applied to objects to change their appearance and behavior. 
This includes objects such as alignments and surfaces and also labels. You understand how 
objects are connected to one another and interact automatically so that you don’t have to 
spend extra time “fixing” your design when something changes. You appreciate the richness 
of a 3-D model and understand how powerful it is for performing design in today’s fast-paced 
and demanding world. And, finally, you can share data within a team by using data shortcuts 
to share design data between drawings.
Now that you understand and appreciate the dynamic Civil 3D environment, you will move 
forward into the next chapters with greater insight. As you progress through this book, be 
on the lookout for instances where this dynamic environment offers power and efficiency. 
Remember these examples and take them with you when you begin designing your own proj-
ects using Civil 3D.

Establishing Existing 
Conditions Using 
Survey Data
With our tour of the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software user interface and our study 
of its capabilities behind us, it’s now time to do what we came here to do: Use 
Civil 3D to complete a land-development project. To begin to understand the task 
ahead, let’s imagine land development as creating a sculpture, but on a very large 
scale. If sculptors were to create works of art from wood, they would probably 
begin by studying the original piece of wood, assessing its dimensions, shape, and 
surface features. These elements would all factor into how the sculptors would 
approach their work. A sculptor with some computer savvy might even model the 
original piece of wood on a computer and plan out each cut of material.
In this chapter, we are going to explore the first activities that are per-
formed during a land-development project: the measurement, mapping, and 
modeling of the land in its existing form. To plan out how the land will be 
reshaped, you must first understand how it’s shaped right now. This is analo-
gous to the sculptor’s measurement and assessment of their medium. The 
measurement and mapping of land is known as surveying, and the data that 
is collected during the process is known as survey data.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Understand the purpose and function of survey data
▶
▶Create a survey database
▶
▶Import survey data
▶
▶Automate field-to-finish

▶Edit survey points

What Is Survey Data?
Think back to the last time you played connect-the-dots to draw a picture. Ever 
wonder who made the dots and how they were made? I’m no expert, but I’m 
guessing someone took the original picture, laid a piece of tracing paper over it, 
and made dots along the edges of key features in the picture. Someone skilled at 
this would make just enough dots to define the features but not so many as to 
make them confusing or wasteful. The dots are a way of capturing an image and 
transferring it to another location.
In land development, the land is the picture and the surveyor is the one who 
makes the dots—referred to as points. Obviously, tracing paper can’t be used, so 
the surveyor lays an imaginary grid over the land (a coordinate system) and cre-
ates the points as information by recording their coordinates on this grid paper. 
The tools the surveyor uses are extremely accurate and are capable of capturing 
the location of each point within a tolerance of about 1⁄8 of an inch (3 mm). 
Something different about the surveyor’s “dots” is that their location is recorded 
in all three dimensions. This enables a technician to play connect-the-dots in 
3-D to create a 3-D model in addition to a 2-D map of the features of the land. 
Another difference is that a surveyor’s dots have description codes next to them 
instead of just numbers. A description code identifies the type of feature that a 
dot, or point, is intended to represent (see Figure 3.1).

If you’re thinking that it takes a lot of points to capture several acres of land, 
you’re absolutely right. How can you keep track of all those points? How can 
they be easily turned into a 3-D model of the land? Is there some way of auto-
mating the connect-the-dots process? Civil 3D has the answers to these ques-
tions, and in this chapter, you’ll learn how you can use Civil 3D to transform 
raw field points into maps and 3-D models of the land.

Reality Capture
The technology of reality capture has become more and more common in the 
last few years. Reality capture refers to the use of high-density laser scanners to 
collect millions or even billions of data points. The resulting data is often referred 
to as a point cloud because, due to its density, the data often looks like a cloud 
or fog. With this approach, there is no need to play connect-the-dots because 
the data points are so close together that they define the shape of the land.
Although it’s not covered in this book, you should know that Civil 3D has the 
ability to import and use point cloud data to create a model of an existing piece 
of land. The image here shows an example of point cloud data that has been 
imported into Civil 3D.
Creating a Survey Database
In Chapter 2, “Leveraging a Dynamic Environment,” you learned about the 
importance of relationships in Civil 3D and saw firsthand how Civil 3D makes 
use of interactions between different object types. When you’re dealing with 
survey data, these relationships are managed in a survey database. The raw data 
is linked with the screen representation of the points in the survey database, 
which is linked with the linework generated by connecting those points, and 
so on. The survey database is unique in Civil 3D in that it’s stored outside the 
drawing file.

Exercise 3.1: Create a Survey Database
In this exercise, you’ll create a survey database.
	 1.	 Open Civil 3D, and click New on the application menu. When prompted 
for a template, browse to the Chapter 03 class data folder and open 
Essentials.dwt.
	
2.	 Click the Survey tab of the Toolspace.
	
3.	 Right-click Survey Databases, and select Set Working Folder.
	
4.	 Browse to and select the Chapter 03 class data folder, and click OK.
The Survey Working Folder
The working folder is simply the location where survey databases are stored. 
In this exercise, you’ll create a survey database named Essentials. This will 
create a folder in Chapter 03 named Essentials.
	
5.	 Right-click Survey Databases, and click New Local Survey Database.
	
6.	 Type Essentials as the new database name, and click OK.
The Essentials database is now shown on the Survey tab. Note the 
components of the survey database, such as Import Events, Networks, 
Figures, and Survey Points (see Figure 3.2). The survey database estab-
lishes and manages relationships between these different components.

There is no “Complete” drawing for this exercise because you did not modify 
a drawing file. You did create a new survey database, but it’s currently empty. 
In the next exercise, you’ll use the Essentials 1 survey database, which has 
already been created for you. 
Importing Survey Data
After creating a survey database to receive the data, the next step is to transfer 
the raw data into Civil 3D so that the analysis and mapping can begin. There are 
several ways to accomplish this, but in this chapter you’re going to do it the way 
a surveyor would do it. The process of importing data requires some important 
questions to be answered. For your first try, however, you’re going to accept all 
the defaults and see what happens.
Exercise 3.2: Import Survey Data
In this exercise, you’ll import survey data into a survey database and into a 
drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Import Survey Data.dwg located in the 
Chapter 03 class data folder.
	
2.	 On the Home tab of the ribbon, click Import Survey Data.
	
3.	 Select the Essentials 1 survey database, and click Next.

Survey Data Sources
Survey data can come in several forms, depending on the hardware and/or 
software used to create it. Here are a few of the most common forms:
Field Book File    This is considered a legacy format unique to Autodesk 
products such as Land Desktop and older versions of Civil 3D. Many surveyors 
have moved on from field book files but some have done so fairly recently. For 
that reason, you might still find them to be somewhat common. One difference 
with field book files is that they can store the measurements exactly as they 
were taken in the field. The other formats listed here contain points that have 
been reduced to coordinates.
LandXML File    Many civil engineering and surveying programs can export 
data in the form of LandXML, including Civil 3D. This nonproprietary format 
enables data to be exchanged between programs created by different software 
companies.
Point File    The point file is probably the most generic and universally accepted 
way of delivering point data. This type of file is plain text and can be opened in 
a program like Microsoft Notepad. Regardless of age, cost, or origin, nearly all 
surveying and civil engineering programs are capable of producing this type of file.
Points From Drawing    With this option, you can open a drawing that 
already contains points and add them to your survey database. Remember that 
the survey database is stored outside the drawing, so the points you see in the 
drawing are a representation of what is stored there.
	
6.	 For Files Of Type, select the Text/Template/Extract File (*.txt) option. 
Then select Topo Survey.txt, and click Open.
	
7.	 Under Specify Point File Format, scroll down and select PNEZD 
(Comma Delimited).
PNEZD represents 
the order of the data 
columns in the text 
file: Point number, 
Northing, Easting, Z 
coordinate (elevation), 
and Description.

9.	 In the Import Options dialog box, check the boxes next to Process 
Linework During Import and Insert Survey Points.
	
10.	 Verify that Current Figure Prefix Database and Current Linework 
Code Set are both set to Sample.
	
11.	 Click Finish.

Importing Points without a Survey Database
Sometimes you may want to import points straight into your Civil 3D drawing 
without the extended data-management capabilities of the survey database. You 
can do this using the Points From File command on the Insert tab of the ribbon, 
as shown in the following illustration.
The resulting dialog box (shown next) provides only one choice for file format—a 
text file—and no association with a survey database or linework code is set.
For that reason, some of the features you’ll learn about later in this chapter will 
not be utilized. These include the automatic generation of linework, accuracy 
adjustment, and others.
(Continues)

	
Au t o m at i n g F i e l d-t o - F i n i s h 	
4 5
The differences continue as you work with the points you’ve imported. Points 
created without the management of the survey database are easily edited. You’ll 
find that points created using the Points From File command can be moved as 
easily as moving a circle or a polyline. They can also be freely edited using the 
Properties window. Using the Points From File function is definitely quicker 
and simpler than using the Import Survey Data command; however, there are 
considerable differences in functionality. When you choose which method to use, 
be sure to consider the level of protection, ease of editing, ability to generate 
linework, and interrelationship between points and survey measurements. Each 
method serves a different purpose and should be chosen appropriately.
Automating Field-to-Finish
The term field-to-finish refers to the process of transforming raw survey field 
data into a finished drawing. Before computers, the point data collected in the 
field was plotted on paper by hand, and draftspeople skillfully connected the 
dots and employed other methods to create the desired topographic map. The 
process was manual in the truest sense of the word. Next came the first CAD 
programs, in which points could be plotted on a computer screen and the dots 
connected using primitive entities such as lines, arcs, and polylines. This is what 
many would now refer to as a “manual” process.
As you might guess, the process of making a drawing out of point data is 
quite tedious and presents an opportunity for automation. Imagine using the 
result from the steps in the previous section (see Figure 3.3) to create a map 
of the land. With no information accompanying the points, it would be nearly 
impossible. In the following sections, you’ll see how to use several Civil 3D fea-
tures to automate this process, resulting in a drawing that is 80- to 90-percent 
complete immediately after you import the raw field data. However, as is usu-
ally the case, the more automation you want, the more setup you’re required 
to perform. Automation is another way of saying that you’re going to make a 
bunch of decisions ahead of time and ask the computer to carry out those deci-
sions when needed.
The following Civil 3D features enable you to convert raw field data into 
drawing information.

of surface features 
combined with contour 
lines representing the 
third dimension.

Linework Code Set
To create linear features using connected points, someone has to tell those features 
when to start, when to end, when to draw curves, when to draw straight lines, and 
so on. In other words, it can be a bit more complicated than “Draw a line from 
point 1 to point 2.” Field crews use codes to carry out these geometric instructions. 
For example, they might include the string BEG when locating the first point on 
a fence line, which means to begin a new feature at that point. The linework code 
set correlates these field codes with instructions that control the generation of 
linework in the drawing. This is the way of telling Civil 3D that BEG means “begin 
drawing here,” BCV means “begin curve here,” and so on. Another way to think of a 
linework code set is as a translator between field language and Civil 3D language.
Exercise 3.3: Apply a Linework Code Set
In this exercise, you’ll assign a linework code set to your drawing and apply it to 
points that have been imported.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Linework Code Set.dwg located in the 
Chapter 03 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Survey tab of the Toolspace.
	
3.	 If the contents beneath the Essentials 2 survey database are not 
visible, right-click Essentials 2 and select Open For Edit.
If you receive an error message here, you may not have installed the 
datasets correctly. Refer to the introduction for instructions on installing 
the datasets.
	
4.	 Expand Import Events. Right-click Topo Survey.txt, and select 
Properties.
	
5.	 Click the Browse icon next to File to open the text file. Notice the 
codes BEG, BCV, ECV, and END. 
These are the codes used in the field to represent Begin Feature, 
Begin Curve, End Curve, and End Feature. If you scroll down in the 
text file, you’ll also see the CLS code, which represents Close Feature.

Properties dialog box.

Point Styles
Not all points are meant to be connected with other points. Some represent 
stand-alone features such as power poles, manholes, or trees. These types of 
features are typically represented with a symbol that either resembles their true 
form or uniquely identifies them. With the Point Styles feature, a symbol can 
be used to mark a point, meaning the likeness of a power pole, manhole, or tree 
can be used instead of an x or a dot.
Point Label Styles
For some points, you might want labeling to be included automatically. For exam-
ple, you may want trees to be labeled with their common names or manholes to 
be labeled with their top elevations. When the annotation is very uniform, point 
label styles can be employed to provide the desired labels automatically.
◀
You should see a series 
of lines appear in the 
drawing. As you'll learn 
later in this chapter, 
these lines represent 
features like tree lines, 
fences, roads, and 
streams.

Description Keys
As discussed, it takes a lot of points to capture several acres of land effectively. To 
make things even more challenging, field crews often use abbreviated versions of 
descriptions to represent points, such as EP for edge of pavement, CLRD for cen-
terline of road, and so on. The result is hundreds or even thousands of points all 
clumped together and labeled with cryptic abbreviated descriptions.
Description keys solve this problem by automatically sorting the points onto the 
appropriate layers, rewriting the abbreviated descriptions to full-length descrip-
tions, and automatically applying point styles to control the appearance of the 
points. For example, a description key takes a point coded as PP, places it on the 
utility layer, displays it as a power pole, and rewrites the description to say POWER 
POLE. Imagine the time saved when this is done automatically for 10,000 points.
Exercise 3.4: Configure and Apply a 
Description Key
In this exercise, you’ll configure a description key for the tree points in your draw-
ing. You’ll apply the description key and observe the automation that it enables.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Description Keys.dwg located in the 
Chapter 03 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Settings tab of the Toolspace, and expand Point ➢ 
Description Key Sets.

What’s Up with the Dollar Signs?
In the previous exercise, you used a code of $1″ $2 to create the full description 
for the trees. The $ is a special code that tells Civil 3D you want to use part of 
the raw description in the full description. The parts of the raw description are 
separated by spaces and numbered from left to right, starting at zero. Thus, 
in the raw description TR 12 OAK, TR is $0, 12 is $1, and OAK is $2. So $1″ $2 
becomes 12″ OAK. With metric values in the raw description TR 300 OAK, TR is 
$0, 300 is $1, and OAK is $2. So $1mm $2 becomes 300 mm OAK. This is a great 
way for the person in the field to control the outcome in the drawing with as 
few keystrokes as possible.

linework commands, but what happens to those features once they are drawn?

property line or breakline? The figure prefix database is the means by which 
these decisions can be made up front for specific codes. For example, any feature 
drawn through points coded EP (edge of pavement) will be drawn on the pave-
ment layer and tagged as a key component for establishing a hard edge in the

Survey Figures
At this point, you may be wondering what the word figure means or, specifi-
cally, what a survey figure is. A Civil 3D survey figure is the program’s way of 
representing a linear feature that has been defined using survey data. A survey 
figure is commonly used to represent visible features such as fence lines, edges 
of pavement, and treelines as well as topographic features such as tops and bot-
toms of embankments. The topographic feature line layers are usually turned 
off when the drawing is plotted. Survey figures can be referenced by other Civil 
3D objects such as surfaces, feature lines, and corridors, enabling design work 
to tie into existing features and topography, where applicable.

Point Groups
Point groups are another way of managing large amounts of point data. This 
feature enables you to sort points based on a number of factors, such as descrip-
tion, elevation, point number, and manual selection. You can set up point 
groups ahead of time so that points can be automatically sorted into groups as 
they are imported into the drawing. You can also create new point groups on 
the fly to sort points as you go.
Once points have been grouped, you can use them to study and manipulate 
multiple points at once. The groups are listed in Prospector, and you can view 
the points contained in each group simply by clicking the group name and 
viewing the contents of the point group in the item view at the bottom (see 
Figure 3.5). In addition, many point-editing commands allow you to select 
points by group, enabling you to modify large numbers of points at once.

Point Groups vs. Description Keys
At this point, you may be scratching your head a bit, thinking that a few minutes 
ago you learned that description keys control the point style and point label style 
assigned to a point. Well, you’re right—they do. However, you may have also 
noticed that when you assign these styles using description keys, the choice at 
the top of the list in each case is <default>. This choice could (and maybe should) 
be changed to say ByPointGroup, because that’s what it essentially means. When 
you configure your description keys to use <default> as the style, you’re deferring 
the decision about what style to use for the point groups. If you choose anything 
else, you’re making that decision right then and there.
You should find 
<default> at the top of 
the list. You may need 
to scroll up.
◀
◀
All Points is a special 
point group that must 
exist in all drawings. 
As the name implies, it 
always contains all the 
points in the drawing.
This is an example of 
using a group to make 
a selection of points. 
Imagine selecting all 
these road points one 
by one.
◀
◀
You have just created 
a file that contains 
only points in the 
Roads point group. 
You might do this if a 
road designer asks for 
point information on 
a road that has been 
surveyed.

Feel better about it? Well, unfortunately, there’s another feature to consider 
that makes this a little more complicated but also gives you even more flexibility 
when stylizing points. One of the properties of a point group is the ability to set 
up an override. When you set up a point style or point label style as an override, 
it means you’re going to apply that style regardless of whether it’s <default> 
or something else. The Overrides tab in the Point Group Properties dialog box 
enables you to do this.
If you’re wondering whether point groups or description keys are best to use, the 
answer is both. By thoroughly understanding how each method can be applied 
to your point data, you can use both point groups and description keys to stylize 
and organize your points in the best way possible. When you’re starting out, 
however, you may want to pick one method or the other, completely develop 
that method, and then sprinkle in the other method little by little, observing 
and understanding how the two work together.
Evolve Your Standards
In the previous exercises, you made some corrections and assigned a specific 
linework code set and figure prefix database to the data you imported. In an 
actual production environment, the changes you make to the description key 
set should be incorporated into the company template so that the tree points 
are handled correctly for all future jobs. The point groups you create could also 
be included in the company template so that they’re available on all future jobs. 
In addition, the linework code set and figure prefix database that you use could 
be assigned as defaults so that they are automatically applied to future data 
imports. A CAD manager typically handles this type of configuration manage-
ment, but end users like you usually identify the needs for the changes. When 
you’re working with Civil 3D in a production environment, be sure to work with 
your CAD manager to make sure you and your coworkers are leveraging the 
configuration of Civil 3D as much as possible.

Editing Survey Points
As discussed, it takes many points to survey a piece of land—that’s hundreds 
or even thousands of individual measurements and hand-typed field codes. On 
nearly every project, there will be items that require editing. Once the data has 
been imported into Civil 3D, the field crew is off to its next job, and the task of 
fixing things up belongs to you.
For several reasons, editing survey points is a bit different from editing “regu-
lar” points, properly referred to as COGO points. One reason is that survey points 
are considered “sacred” and are not typically moved or modified in any way 
without considerable thought and/or the supervision of a surveyor. The second 
reason, related to the first, is that Civil 3D uses a separate survey database sys-
tem to store points. The points in the drawing are essentially locked and can’t be 
changed unless the information in the survey database changes. With this sys-
tem, a surveyor can send out the drawing file without sharing the survey data-
base that goes with it. When the points in the drawing are separated from the 
survey database, they become locked and can’t be easily modified. In this way, 
the survey database gives control of the points to the person who created them.
Exercise 3.7: Edit Survey Points
In this exercise, you’ll edit a survey point to correct a field coding error. You’ll dem-
onstrate that access to the survey database is necessary for editing survey points.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Edit Survey Points.dwg located in the 
Chapter 03 class data folder. If a survey database is open, right-click 
it and select Close Survey Database.
	
2.	 Locate and zoom in to the red point along the west treeline, as shown 
in Figure 3.6.
	
3.	 Open the Properties window, and then select the red point. Note that 
there is a typo in the raw description. It should say TR 12 PINE (TR 
300 PINE) instead of TTR 12 PINE (TTR 300 PINE). You can’t edit 
the raw description here because the data is stored in the survey 
database.

Survey Points vs. COGO Points
As previously mentioned, there are two types of points: COGO points and survey 
points. How can you tell the difference? Here are a few characteristics of each 
to help you distinguish between the two:
Survey Point Characteristics
▶
▶Only survey points are displayed on the Survey tab (COGO points are not).
▶
▶Survey points are displayed on both the Prospector and the Survey tabs.
▶
▶Survey points have an icon next to them that looks like a survey target 
(an hourglass inside a box overlaid on crosshairs).
The survey database 
is needed to edit the 
points. This is how the 
points are kept safe 
when the drawing is 
shared outside the 
survey office.

database is the result 
of correctly completing 
the previous exercise.

vided to ensure that 
you start the current 
exercise with the cor-
rect version.

Editing Survey Figures
Mistakes in the field can lead to errors in the way linework is drawn. Once 
again, the changes need to be made a certain way because you’re dealing with 
special survey objects, this time survey figures. Survey figures are linked to the 
survey database, but unlike survey points, they can be edited without accessing 
the survey database. If you edit survey figures in this way, you need to be aware

When this occurs you should take steps to keep them in sync to ensure that the 
correct data is used in the future.
Exercise 3.8: Edit Survey Figures
In this exercise, you’ll edit several survey figures to correct errors that took 
place due to incorrect translation from the field to the drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Edit Survey Figures.dwg located in the 
Chapter 03 class data folder.
	
2.	 If the contents beneath the Essentials 5 survey database are not 
visible, right-click Essentials 5 and select Open For Edit.
	 3.	 In the top-right viewport, locate the building that is missing its 
north side. Click the building figure line, and then click Survey 
Figure Properties on the ribbon. Notice that point 285 is missing a 
CLS (close) code that would provide the north side of the building by 
closing the rectangle.
	
4.	 Click point 285 in the point list; then set the Closed value to Yes, and 
click OK. The shape of the building is now closed. Because you used 
the Survey Figure Properties command to edit this figure, the draw-
ing and the survey database are in sync.
	
5.	 Press Esc to clear the previous selection. Pan to the southeast until 
you can see the building to the west of the 6″ (150 mm) pine. This 
building should appear as two separate buildings.

Creating Additional Points
You may occasionally need to create your own points to establish key locations 
in the drawing. For example, early in the design, you may want to show specific 
locations for proposed test borings or property corners that need to be found. 
Another example is that you may have a point file that you would like to import 
into the drawing without including it in a survey database. Civil 3D has a multi-
tude of tools designed to create points easily and efficiently. They are found on a 
special toolbar that opens when you click the Point Creation Tools command on 
the Home tab of the ribbon.
In many ways, the points you create using these tools are treated in the same 
manner as those created by importing survey data. They can be placed in point

groups and can respond to description keys. They can also be affected by point 
styles and point label styles. There are differences, however, between these 
points and those created by importing survey data. For example, Civil 3D can’t 
automatically generate linework by importing points in this manner. Also, these 
points don’t have the protection of the survey database, allowing them to be 
edited by anyone who opens the drawing. Regardless of how they are created, 
all points can be exported to a file that can be uploaded to a portable device and 
taken to the field to be staked out.
Exercise 3.9: Import Points and Create  
Points Manually
In this exercise, you’ll begin by importing points that represent property cor-
ners that were found on the site. Then you’ll create stake-out points to assist 
field crews in locating several missing property corners. You’ll also create points 
along the proposed road centerlines. These points will represent the locations of 
soil-test borings to be performed on the site.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Stake Out.dwg located in the Chapter 03 
class data folder. 
This drawing contains a calculated property boundary recon-
structed from a deed or other source of information. It also contains 
a preliminary layout of the road centerlines that will be used to deter-
mine soil-test boring locations. You’ll begin by inserting points into 
the drawing that represent property corners located in the field.
	
2.	 On the Insert tab of the ribbon, click Points From File.
	 3.	 In the Import Points dialog box, select PNEZD (Comma Delimited)  
as the format. Then click the plus sign icon and browse to the 
Chapter 03 class data folder.

Then select Found Corners.txt, and click Open.
	
5.	 Click OK to dismiss the Import Points dialog box.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand the world of survey data as it exists 
in the Civil 3D environment. You understand that survey data must reside in a survey database 
that exists separately from the drawing file. You know how to import data into the survey 
database and display it in your drawing as points and linework. You know how to automate 
the organization and graphical properties of the points and linework using linework code sets, 
description keys, the figure prefix database, and point groups. You can edit survey points and 
survey figures by accessing the survey database and making changes using the appropriate 
tools. Finally, you know several additional methods for importing points and creating them 
manually.
With the knowledge and skills you have gained in this chapter, you’re ready to begin working 
with survey data in Civil 3D: turning it from raw field data into a drawing representing the 
existing conditions of a project.

This file could be sent

Chapter 4
Modeling the Existing 
Terrain Using Surfaces
In Chapter 3, “Establishing Existing Conditions Using Survey Data,” you 
learned how to establish the existing conditions of a project by playing a very 
elaborate game of connect-the-dots. So far, you’ve been solving the connect-
the-dots puzzle in only two dimensions—creating the treelines, fence lines, 
buildings, trees, and so on. Now, you’ll use the same data to establish the 
third dimension of your existing conditions model, and you’ll do that using 
AutoCAD® Civil 3D® surfaces.
Many would say the goal in this process is to generate existing contours for 
the project. Twenty years ago, that would have been the case, but in this era 
of 3-D modeling, the result of your efforts will serve a much greater purpose. 
Although it’s true that you’ll be able to create contours from your surface 
model, you’ll also create an accurate 3-D representation of the ground that 
can be used in many ways throughout the project.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Understand the purpose and function of surfaces
▶
▶Create a surface from survey data
▶
▶Use breaklines to improve surface accuracy
▶
▶Edit surfaces
▶
▶Display and analyze surfaces
▶
▶Annotate surfaces

Understanding Surfaces
As you might guess, the 3-D game of connect-the-dots is a bit more sophisti-
cated than the 2-D version. In addition, you need the result to be a 3D model 
rather than just lines. To accomplish this, Civil 3D uses a computer algorithm 
that connects the dots in the most efficient and accurate way possible. This 
algorithm is known as a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) algorithm. 
The TIN algorithm works by connecting one point to at least two of its 
neighbors using 3-D lines. Because each point connects to two or more of its 
neighbors, the resulting model looks something like a spider web made up of 
triangles (the T in TIN). Because the spacing between points is typically non-
uniform, the triangles come in many shapes and sizes, which is why it’s called 
irregular (the I in TIN). The network (the N in TIN) part comes from all the 
points being connected by lines and the points and lines being related to one 
another. Figure 4.1 shows a surface with its TIN lines visible.

make up the surface model.

There’s even more to it than the triangles, though. In fact, the triangles are 
just a handy visual representation of the algorithm at work, and by themselves, 
they aren’t all that useful. What is useful is that the algorithm can calculate the 
elevation of any point within the area covered by the TIN model. So, even if you 
pick a point in the open space inside a triangle, the elevation will be calculated. 
This is what makes the TIN model a true model. It can be sliced, be turned on 
its side, have water poured on it, be excavated, and be filled in—all virtually, of 
course. The capability of using surface models for these types of calculations 
and simulations is what makes them so useful and puts them at the core of Civil 
3D functionality.
Creating a Surface from Survey Data
You create a surface in Prospector by simply right-clicking the Surfaces node of 
the tree and selecting Create Surface, as shown in Figure 4.2. The newly created 
surface appears in Prospector immediately, but it can’t be seen in the drawing 
until some data is added to it. The fundamental components of a surface are 
points and lines. It’s your job to supply the source of the points, and Civil 3D 
takes care of drawing the lines. At this phase of the project, you’ll be using sur-
vey points as the initial source of surface-point data.

Components of a Surface
As shown in Figure 4.3, you can use many potential types of information to create 
a surface and control its shape. The following list describes each one briefly:
Boundaries    Boundaries are used to control where the surface is. A boundary 
around the edge of a surface can keep it contained within a certain area. Another 
type of boundary can keep a surface out of an interior area, like a pond or building.
Breaklines    Breaklines force TIN lines to align with them. In this way, they 
help to define hard edges such as edges of embankments, curb lines, ditch lines, 
and so on.

Contours    Usually, we think of contours as the end product of building a 
surface, but they can also be used as a source of data for a surface.
DEM Files    DEM stands for digital elevation model, and it’s typically associ-
ated with large-scale mapping that has relatively low accuracy. DEMs can often 
be found alongside large-scale mapping data and are typically only accurate 
enough for rough analysis or calculations.
Drawing Objects    Drawing objects are AutoCAD® software entities such as 
lines, blocks, and even text. These items can be used to help define a surface as 
effectively as survey points, as long as they’ve been created at the appropriate 
elevations.
Edits    Edits aren’t actual data, but they do contribute to the makeup of a 
surface. There are many ways in which a surface can be edited to improve its accu-
racy or usability. Some of these editing methods will be covered in this chapter.
Point Files    You’ve already learned that a point file is a text file containing 
x, y, and z data. So far, you’ve used these files to create Civil 3D points in the 
drawing, but the same data can also be imported directly into a surface.
Point Groups    In Chapter 3, you learned that one of the benefits of point 
groups is that they enable multiple points to be selected simultaneously. Using 
one or more point groups to define a surface is one of the most important and 
most common uses of point groups in Civil 3D.
Point Survey and Figure Survey Queries    These queries are created 
using the survey functionality and utilize a sophisticated way of selecting points 
and figures based on survey properties. These queries are not covered in this 
book, but information about them is available within the Civil 3D help content.

This way of studying 
the surface gives a real

as a “solid” model in 
which the area inside 
the triangles has sub-
stance. It’s also a great

and the surface model 
(see Figure 4.5).

Using Breaklines to Improve Surface 
Accuracy
The TIN algorithm creates surfaces by drawing 3-D lines between points that are 
closest to each other. In certain instances, this is not the most accurate way to 
model the surface, and the TIN lines must be forced into a specific arrangement. 
This arrangement typically coincides with a linear feature such as a curb, the top 
of an embankment, or a wall. This forced alignment of TIN lines along a linear 
feature is best handled with a breakline. In Figure 4.6, the blue lines represent the 
edges of a channel and the TIN lines are shown in red. In the image on the top, 
the blue lines have not been added to the channel surface as breaklines, result-
ing in a rough and inaccurate representation of the channel. In the image on the 
bottom, the breaklines have been applied and force the TIN lines to align with the 
edges of the channel, producing a much smoother and more accurate model.

From Prospector, you can add breaklines by right-clicking the Breaklines 
node for a given surface and selecting Add (see Figure 4.7). When it comes to 
survey data, there is an even easier way. From the Survey Toolspace, you can 
right-click Figures and select Create Breaklines. This opens a list of all your 
survey figures with some checked as breaklines and some not (see Figure 4.8). 
How does the command know which is which? This was specified in the figure 
prefix database you learned about in Chapter 3. As the figures were created, they 
were automatically tagged as breaklines or non-breaklines according to the code 
assigned to the points that define them.

Exercise 4.2: Add Breaklines
In this exercise, you’ll add breaklines to a surface and observe their effect on the 
accuracy of the surface.

Chapter 04 class data folder.
	
2.	 On the Survey tab of the Toolspace, right-click Survey Databases and 
select Set Working Folder.

Breaklines in the Field
As you study the list of figures in this exercise, are you wondering why some are 
designated as breaklines and others are not? Breaklines are linear features that 
mark a change in the slope of the ground. Some of these are quite obvious, such 
as a set of bottom of bank (BOB) points or top of ditch (TOPD) points. Others serve 
double duty, such as an edge of pavement (EP). This survey figure marks the line 
where pavement ends and dirt begins, but typically there is also a change in slope 
at this line between the slope of the ground and the manmade slope of the road. 
For this reason, EPs are often tagged as breaklines. Other features obviously 
have nothing to do with the slope of the ground, such as a right of way (ROW), 
treeline (TL), and fence line (FENC); therefore, they aren’t checked as breaklines.

You should notice a change in the contours along the red break-
lines. These breaklines define the swales, edges, and ridges that were 
recognized in the field and explicitly located as terrain features. In 
addition, notice that contours now cover the road area to the north. 
The surface in this area is made strictly of breaklines.

This exercise shows you the importance of breaklines. Connecting a bunch 
of points together with 3-D triangular shapes does not necessarily generate an 
accurate surface. In certain areas, the shapes themselves have to be manipu-
lated so that they align with terrain features in order to model their form accu-
rately. Figure 4.10 compares the surface with and without breaklines in both 
2-D and 3-D views.

Breakline Settings and Options
The Add Breaklines dialog box has several options and values to choose from. 
Here is a brief explanation of each:
Type    Of the five types listed here, only two are important to discuss at this 
time: proximity and standard. Standard breaklines have two jobs. First, they 
control the alignment of TIN lines, as discussed previously. Second, their vertices 
are a source of additional point information in the drawing. As you might recall, 
the only point group you added to the surface is Ground Shots, so you’ll need the 
points to come along with any breaklines you add. For this to work, the vertices 
of the breaklines must be 3-D and must be at the correct elevations.
(Continues)

7 6  
C h ap t e r  4 • M o d e l i n g t h e E x i s t i n g Te r r a i n U s i n g S u r f a c e s
Proximity breaklines have only one job, which is to control the alignment of TIN 
lines. Therefore, proximity breaklines only need to be 2-D, but they must have 
points in their proximity so that they can “steal” their elevations. If you had 
added all the survey points to your surface, then the survey figures could have 
been added as proximity breaklines.
Weeding Factors    Sometimes, the items you use for breaklines can have 
too many vertices on them, and you’ll want to eliminate some of them so that 
your surface isn’t overloaded with data. The selective removal of points based 
on distance and angle is known as weeding.
Supplementing By Distance    Sometimes your breaklines will have long 
stretches without any vertices in them. Because new TIN lines are created only 
where there are points, and points are created only where there are vertices, some 
supplemental vertices may be needed to improve the accuracy of the surface. 
When you check the box next to Distance, Civil 3D creates more points along the 
breakline that are spaced out according to the value you provide.
Supplementing By Mid-Ordinate    Curves are a bit of a challenge because 
TIN lines are straight and curves are, well, curved. For that reason, any curves in 
a breakline are approximated with a series of short TIN lines. Just how short and 
numerous these lines are depends on the mid-ordinate setting. Mid-ordinate is a 
geometric term that refers to the perpendicular distance between an arc and its 
chord. When this distance is short, the chord is also short, and multiple instances 
of it can fit within the length of the arc. This might seem like a strange way to 
define this behavior, but what’s handy about it is that a single mid-ordinate 
value works pretty well for a fairly wide range of curve radii. The following image 
shows the effect of the mid-ordinate setting on a surface. The image on the left 
uses a value of 0.1, and the image on the right uses a value of 1.0.

Editing Surfaces
With the inclusion of points and breaklines in the surface, you have essentially 
provided all the data that will be needed to create the surface model. However, 
you should continue manipulating this data until you achieve the most accurate 
representation possible of the existing ground surface. You can edit surfaces in 
many ways. In the following sections, you’ll learn about three surface-editing 
methods: adding boundaries, deleting lines, and editing points.
Adding Boundaries
As discussed earlier, boundaries are a way of defining where the surface is and 
where it isn’t. In the example project, you don’t want the surface to exist out-
side the area that has been surveyed. Why would the surface extend beyond the 
survey data? If the edge of an area represented by the points happens to bend 
inward, the lines will extend across the “bay” (see Figure 4.11) and will create 
misrepresented surface data in that area. One way to avoid or correct this situa-
tion is to provide an outer boundary that prevents the surface from existing in 
these areas.
Erroneous TIN Lines
“Bay”
F i g u r e   4 . 1 1    Erroneous TIN lines created across a bay in the surface data
Another common example of surfaces being where they shouldn’t be is within 
the shape of a building. It’s considered poor drafting practice to show contours 
passing through a building. After all, the ground surface isn’t accessible in that 
location. Another type of boundary, called a hide boundary, can be used to remove 
surface data from within a surface, thus creating a void, or “hole,” in the surface.

Types of Boundaries
The four types of boundaries you can create with Civil 3D are as follows:
Outer    An outer boundary establishes a perimeter for the surface. No surface 
data can exist outside an outer boundary. This type of boundary is commonly 
used in most surfaces.
Hide    A hide boundary creates a void, or “hole,” in the surface. Hide boundaries 
are commonly used to remove surface data within buildings.
Show    A show boundary creates an island of data within a hide boundary. An 
example of a show boundary is a courtyard within the footprint of a building.
Data Clip    The first three types of boundaries hide the surface data after it has 
been created. A data-clip boundary is a special type of boundary that prevents data 
outside it from ever becoming part of the surface. Data-clip boundaries are used 
in cases where a small surface is made from source data that covers a large area.
Exercise 4.3: Add Boundaries
In this exercise, you’ll add boundaries around the buildings that will remove 
surface data from within their footprints.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Surface Boundaries.dwg located in the 
Chapter 04 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click one of the surface contours in the top-right viewport. Then, on 
the Tin Surface: EG tab of the ribbon, click Add Data ➢ Boundaries.
	
3.	 Enter Bld1 as the boundary name, and select Hide as the type. Make sure 
the box next to Non-Destructive Breakline is checked, and click OK.
	
4.	 Select one of the buildings in the top-right viewport, and press Enter.
You should immediately see a hole appear in the surface shown 
in the lower-right viewport. If you’ve selected a building with con-
tours running through it, you’ll see the contours disappear in the 
upper-right viewport. It appears that they have been trimmed, but 
actually, the surface data has been removed from within the shape 
of the building.

through them. Use a name other than Bld1 or the software won’t 
accept your boundaries.
	
6.	 In the lower-right viewport, zoom in to the area of the buildings, and 
notice that there are now voids where the buildings are located, as 
shown in Figure 4.12.

Deleting Lines
Another, less eloquent way of removing unwanted TIN lines is to delete them from 
the surface rather than use a boundary to do it for you. This method is best when 
you need to remove only a few TIN lines in isolated areas. There are two impor-
tant things to remember when deleting TIN lines. First, in order for the lines to 
be deleted, they must be visible, which means you must apply a style that displays 
them. Second, you can’t use the AutoCAD ERASE command to remove them; 
instead, you must use the Delete Line command created specifically for surfaces.
◀
Remember that con-
tours aren’t the only 
things surfaces are 
used for. No matter 
how you look at this 
surface, you don’t want 
data to appear where 
the buildings are.

Editing Points
As you have learned, the fundamental building blocks of surfaces are points 
and lines. The points are derived from some other source of data, such as stan-
dard breaklines, contours, survey points, and so on. If there is an error in one 
of those source objects, there will be an error in the surface as well. When this 
occurs, you can either edit the source data and rebuild the surface or edit the 
surface itself.
Exercise 4.5: Edit Points
You have already learned about editing survey source data (survey points and 
survey figures). In this exercise, you’ll edit the surface.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Points.dwg located in your 
Chapter 04 class data folder.
The two right viewports are zoomed in to the location where the 
driveway meets the road on the north side of the property. In this 
area, one of the surface points is incorrect. In the plan view on the 
top right, the effects of the incorrect point can be seen in the densely 
packed contours. In the 3-D view on the bottom right, the erroneous 
point appears as a downward spike in the surface.
	
2.	 Click one of the contours to select the surface, and then click Surface 
Properties on the ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Surface Properties dialog box, click the Information tab and 
change Surface Style to Triangles And Points. Click OK.
The display of the surface changes to lines and points, with the 
points appearing as plus-sign markers.
	
4.	 Click any TIN line to select the surface, and then click Edit Surface ➢ 
Modify Point on the ribbon.
	
5.	 When prompted to select a point, click the point in the 3-D view that 
is located well below the other points (see Figure 4.14). Press Enter.

Displaying and Analyzing Surfaces
Because you’re working with surface objects in Civil 3D, you can do much more 
than simply show contours. Civil 3D surfaces can help you tell many different 
stories about the shape of the land and how water will flow across it. They are 
able to do this through multiple types of analyses as well as the ability for styles 
to display analysis results in nearly any way you wish. With these tools at your 
disposal, you can study the terrain thoroughly and make smart choices about 
the direction of your design early in the process.
Analyzing Elevation
Elevation analysis allows you to delineate any number of elevation ranges and 
then graphically distinguish the different ranges by color. This is a useful tool 
in many instances, especially when you’re working with someone who doesn’t 
know how to read contours.

Analyzing Slope
Another important aspect of the terrain is the slope. Areas with very steep slopes 
are difficult to navigate either by construction vehicles or the eventual occupants 
of the property. Flat slopes are much more accessible, but if they are too flat, 
then drainage problems often occur. One of your tasks as a designer is to ensure 
that your project has the right slopes in the right areas. By studying the slopes of 
the existing topography, you can locate features where slopes are good or deter-
mine that terrain modifications will be necessary to create good slopes.
Civil 3D can display slopes in two ways. The first is to show the slopes as col-
ored ranges like the ones you saw in the previous section. The second is to use 
slope arrows that can be color-coded to indicate what range they’re located in, 
with the added benefit of always pointing downhill to show you the direction of 
water flow.
Exercise 4.7: Analyze Slope
In this exercise, you’ll perform a slope analysis on a surface in your drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Slope Analysis.dwg located in the 
Chapter 04 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click one of the contours to select the surface, and then click Surface

3.	 On the Information tab of the Surface Properties dialog box, change 
Surface Style to Slope Banding (3-D).
	 4.	 Click the Analysis tab. Change Analysis Type to Slopes, and click the 
downward-pointing arrow.
	
5.	 Click OK. Press Esc to clear the selection of the surface and zoom in 
to the 3-D view of the surface in the bottom-right viewport.
In the 3-D image on the bottom right, the darkest reds signify 
the steepest slopes. This enables you to see that the area north of 
the farm is fairly flat pasture land while the area to the south of the 
farm slopes dramatically toward the stream farther to the south (see 
Figure 4.16).
	
6.	 Access Surface Properties again, and change the style to Slope Arrows.
	
7.	 On the Analysis tab, choose Slope Arrows as the analysis type, and

In this view, the darker blues and blacks are the steepest slopes, 
and the arrows themselves always point downhill. As you study the 
arrows, you should notice a drainage divide that runs west to east 
through the farm buildings; it’s delineated in red in Figure 4.17. Rain 
falling to the north of this area drains to the road, and rain falling 
south of it drains to the stream.

Performing Other Types of Analysis
In addition to analyzing elevations, slopes, and slope arrows, you can perform 
the following types of analyses:
Contours    Contours can be used to analyze a surface. They can be color-
coded, and you can create a legend table that shows the area and/or volume the 
contours represent.
Directions    With this type of analysis, you can see a visual representation of 
your surface slopes. For example, you can use the analysis to see which parts of 
your surface slope to the south and which slope to the north.
User-Defined Contours    Contours are usually placed at even intervals, such 
as the 1' (0.5-meter) contours with which you have been working so far. What 
if you want to show a contour that represents elevation 92.75? That’s done as a 
user-defined contour. A user-defined contour is an individual instance of a con-
tour, usually at an irregular interval.
Watersheds    A watershed analysis outlines areas within the surface where rain-
fall runoff flows to a certain point or in a certain direction. This type of analysis 
is yet another way of studying the drainage characteristics of the terrain.
Exploring Even More Analysis Tools
There are even more ways of analyzing your surface that aren’t found in Surface 
Properties. For example, the following tools are especially useful on many 
projects:
Water Drop Tool    With the Water Drop tool, you can click any point on your 
surface and Civil 3D will trace the downhill path of that point until it reaches 
a low point or encounters the edge of the surface. This is a very detailed way to 
study how water will flow across the ground.
Catchment Area Tool    With this tool, you can click a point on the surface and 
Civil 3D will draw a closed shape that represents the area that flows to that point. 
This is very useful when you’re analyzing the effects of rainfall on your project.
Quick Profile    With the Quick Profile tool, you can display a slice of your sur-
face to get an edge-on view of it. This can help you understand the slope of the 
land and the location of high and low points.
You’ll learn more about these tools and get hands-on experience with them in 
Chapter 18, “Analyzing, Displaying, and Annotating Surfaces.”

Annotating Surfaces
As you have read, surfaces are used to tell a story about the shape of a piece of 
land. I have presented nearly a dozen different ways to tell that story, but I have 
yet to discuss the most obvious and most common way: telling the story with 
text. In the following exercise, you’ll use three types of labels to annotate a sur-
face: spot elevation labels, slope labels, and contour labels.
Exercise 4.8: Annotate a Surface
In this exercise, you’ll annotate a surface using spot elevation labels, slope 
labels, and contour labels.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Labeling Surfaces.dwg located in the 
Chapter 04 class data folder.
The top-right viewport is zoomed in to the north end of the project 
near the location where the magenta centerline meets the centerline 
of the existing road. Your task is to label the elevation of the existing 
road where these two centerlines meet.
	
2.	 Click one of the contours to select the surface, and then click Add 
Labels ➢ Add Surface Labels on the ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, select Spot Elevation as the label type.
	
4.	 Verify that the spot elevation label style is set to Elevation Only – 
Existing and the marker style is set to Spot Elevation.
	
5.	 Click Add. Snap to the northern endpoint of the magenta centerline. 
A label is placed at the location you selected (see Figure 4.18).

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand the role of surfaces in land-devel-
opment projects. You can create surfaces from survey data and perfect them by adding break-
lines and boundaries. You can modify surfaces by deleting lines and editing points. You can 
get answers and tell stories about surfaces using analysis types such as elevation banding, 
slope banding, and slope arrows. Finally, you’re able to provide additional information about 
a surface using several different types of labels.
Now that you’ve learned this major step in establishing the existing conditions of your project, 
you’re ready to begin learning about the tools used to transform your project through design.


Chapter 5
Designing in 2-D 
Using Alignments
Now that the existing conditions of the project have been thoroughly 
established, you’re ready to move on to designing the new work to be con-
structed on the site. A common way of beginning this design is to lay out 
a 2-D version of some of the key features of the project. If this were a com-
mercial site project, you might start by drawing the outlines of buildings, 
sidewalks, and parking lots. For an environmental project such as wetland 
relocation, you might begin by drawing a 2-D outline of the new wetland 
boundary. Because our example project is a single-family residential develop-
ment, the key features are the roads. Thus, you would begin your design by 
drawing a basic version of them in 2-D. As you’re about to learn, alignments 
in AutoCAD® Civil 3D® are the best tool for establishing this basic geometry 
and then using it as the basis for additional design.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Understand alignments
▶
▶Create alignments from objects
▶
▶Create alignments using the Alignment Creation Tools
▶
▶Edit alignments
▶
▶Apply design criteria files and check sets

Understanding Alignments
You can think of the basic road geometry discussed in the chapter introduction 
as a single-line form of the roads, as shown in Figure 5.1. The lines that you 
draw will typically represent the centerlines of the roads, and eventually you’ll 
build the rest of each road around those centerlines.
F i g u r e   5 . 1    A single-line drawing of the subdivision roads (in red)
Civil 3D alignments are designed specifically for the task of representing 
the initial single-line version of a linear design feature. They are also used to 
establish the backbone of linear designs such as roads, railroads, channels, and 
pipelines. The lines, arcs, and spirals that make up an alignment have the abil-
ity to interact with one another. This enables you to edit part of the alignment 
and have the other parts fix themselves automatically. Also, other design objects 
such as profiles, sections, and corridors can be built around alignments. You’ll 
learn more about these other design objects later in this book.
Creating Alignments from Objects
A common way of creating an alignment is to use the basic AutoCAD® software 
geometry that’s already in the drawing. You may be using someone’s “sketch,” or 
maybe you’ve chosen to draw the initial version of the layout this way because of 
the simplicity of the AutoCAD tools. Whatever the case, Civil 3D makes it fairly 
easy to convert simple AutoCAD entities into alignments.

Exercise 5.1: Create Alignments from Objects
In this exercise, you’ll create alignments from polylines in the drawing that rep-
resent road centerlines. 
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Alignment from Objects.dwg located in 
the Chapter 05 class data folder.
Because alignment design is strictly a 2-D type of design, the draw-
ings in this chapter aren’t set up with multiple viewports.
	
2.	 On the Home tab of the ribbon, click Alignment ➢ Create  
Alignment From Objects.
	
3.	 When the command line prompts you to select an object, click the 
longest magenta polyline, labeled Jordan Court.
	
4.	 Press Enter.
A black arrow should appear on the polyline, indicating the program’s 
guess at the direction of the alignment.
	
5.	 If the arrow is pointing toward the south, press Enter. If it’s pointing 
north, press R and then press Enter.
Believe it or not, the choice here is very important. The direction of 
the alignment will affect the configuration and labeling of many more 
components of this design as it progresses.
	
6.	 In the Create Alignment From Objects dialog box, do the following:
▶
▶For Name, enter Jordan Court.
▶
▶For Type, verify that Centerline is selected.
▶
▶For Site, verify that <None> is selected.
▶
▶For Alignment Style, verify that Proposed is selected.
▶
▶For Alignment Label Set, verify that _No Labels is selected.
▶
▶Uncheck the box next to Add Curves Between Tangents.
▶
▶Verify that the box next to Erase Existing Entities is checked.
▶
▶Click OK.
	
7.	 Click the newly created alignment, and then click one of the magenta 
polylines.
Notice how the polyline grips are different from the alignment 
grips (see Figure 5.2).

Alignments Are Smarter
As you investigate the grip-editing behavior of the alignment versus the polyline, 
what do you find? You should notice that the alignment wants to follow a very 
basic geometric rule that the polyline doesn’t worry about too much: maintain-
ing tangency. Whether you move or stretch a straight line portion (aka tangent) 
or modify a curve, the adjacent lines and curves morph themselves to remain 
tangent (shown here). This is a good thing because driving your car down a road 
where the curves and lines aren’t tangent could be hazardous to your health.

Alignment Terminology
Before jumping into the next exercise, you may want to review the following list 
of terms that you’ll find throughout the Alignment Creation Tools commands as 
well as other places in Civil 3D:
Tangents (Alignment Segments)    The straight-line portions of an 
alignment
Tangent (Geometric Condition)
▶
▶Touching or passing through at a single point
▶
▶In the case of a line and arc: perpendicular to a line drawn from the 
intersection point to the center point of the arc
▶
▶In the case of two arcs: intersecting in such a way that a line drawn 
from the center point of one arc to the center point of the other arc 
passes through the intersection point
Curves    The curved portions of an alignment that have a constant radius
Spiral    The curved portions of an alignment that change in radius from one 
end to the other
PI (Point of Intersection)    The place where two tangents intersect or 
would intersect if they were extended
PC (Point of Curvature)    The place where the curve begins
PT (Point of Tangency)    The place where the curve ends
Free    A line, curve, or spiral that is dependent on another alignment segment 
at both ends
Floating    A line, curve, or spiral that is dependent on another alignment 
segment at one end
Fixed    A line, curve, or spiral that is not dependent on another alignment 
component at either end

Using Temporary Geometry
Existing physical and legal boundary features almost always influence the layout 
of any land-development design. In a residential project such as the example in 
this book, the goal is to create as many optimally sized lots as possible within 
the available area. Every lot must also be accessible from roads built through 
the site. With these things in mind, along with the geometry of the existing 
property boundaries, terrain, and other constraints, it’s frequently helpful to 
create some temporary geometry to guide you in the creation of the alignments.
In the drawing for this exercise, the blue linework is provided for you and rep-
resents geometry that references existing features of the site. Dimensions and 
notes have also been provided to help explain the reasoning behind this geom-
etry. The following list represents key points to consider when you’re creating 
this temporary geometry: 
▶
▶150' (45-m) offset from the road centerline to the backs of the lots to 
accommodate a 50' (15-m) right-of-way, an adequate front yard, a single-
family residence, and an adequate rear yard.
▶
▶Perpendicular intersection with the existing road that is ideal for safety 
and accessibility.
▶
▶Avoidance of the steep area to the south.
▶
▶Uniform geometric properties where possible, such as 90° angles, parallel 
lines, and so on. This is recommended for simpler, more efficient stake-
out and construction.
▶
▶Avoidance of the farmhouse and buildings, because that part of the 
property will be deeded back to the original owner.
In the real world, you’ll need to come up with this temporary geometry on your 
own. In fact, this is what design is all about: using your knowledge and creativity 
to come up with a technical solution to a need or problem. Creating the align-
ment is the easy part. Coming up with the temporary geometry as described 
here is the real challenge.

Editing Alignments
Of course, nobody gets it right the first time. As a general rule, you’ll find your-
self laying things out about 10 percent of the time and spending the remaining 
90 percent making edits. That’s totally OK; it’s the way Civil 3D was designed to 
be used. In fact, it’s highly recommended that you do a rough layout of the basic 
design elements at the beginning of a project and then spend the rest of the 
time adjusting, refining, and improving that initial layout until it’s the way it 
needs to be. This is also a great approach because it matches up with the general 
nature of land-development designs, which typically change frequently through-
out the life of the project.
Editing Alignments with Grips
As you learned in the first section of this chapter, alignments are different. 
They’re smarter and more sophisticated than basic AutoCAD entities. They have 
more types of grips, and the way they respond to geometric changes is more 
intelligent. You can leverage this to make quick visual edits to your alignment 
without ever typing a number or entering a command.
Exercise 5.3: Experiment with Alignment Grips
In this exercise, you’ll experiment with the different grips that can be used for 
editing alignments.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Graphical Editing.dwg located in the 
Chapter 05 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment to display its grips. Click the 
upright triangular grip on the second curve, and move your cursor to 
a new location without clicking the new location.
This grip is located at the PI. As you move it, the curve always remains 
tangent and the radius of the curve remains constant (see Figure 5.4).

done so, download 
and install the files for 
Chapter 5 according to

3.	 Press Esc, and click the circular grip at either end of the curve. Move

These grips are located at the PC and PT. As you move them, the

is accomplished by changing the radius of the curve (see Figure 5.6). 
You can use this grip to make the curve pass through a specific point.

This type of grip is located at either the beginning or the end of

In the case of this alignment, the curve just before the endpoint 
changes the locations of its beginning and ending points to remain 
tangent at both ends (see Figure 5.8).

Another method for editing the alignment design numerically is referred to as 
component-level editing. With this approach, you open the numerical data for a 
piece of the alignment (such as a line, curve, or spiral) in a separate window. You 
do so by clicking the Sub-entity Editor button on the Alignment Layout Tools 
toolbar and then using the Pick Sub-entity tool to choose the part of the align-
ment you want to edit.

Applying Design Criteria Files and  
Check Sets
When you’re laying out a design, how do you know whether you’re doing it 
right? What should the curve radii be? Should there be a minimum tangent 
length between curves, or is it OK to have back-to-back curves? How does the 
expected speed of traffic affect the answers to these questions?
The answers to these types of questions can differ, depending on the project. 
For road design, the government entity that accepts responsibility for the road 
is most likely calling the shots when it comes to design standards. That may be 
the state Department of Transportation (DOT), county planning commission, 
or even the community homeowners association. In other cases, you may be 
designing roads or other linear features on private property that isn’t governed 
by any official design standards. In this case, you’ll have to utilize your knowl-
edge and experience to create the best design. Whether the design standards 
come from you or someone else, it’s helpful to have tools that ensure that your 
design meets the requirements assigned to it.
Design criteria and check sets are two ways of telling Civil 3D what your 
design standards are and asking Civil 3D to tell you when you’ve violated those 
standards by displaying a warning symbol (see Figure 5.15). These two features 
are customizable, so you can use them to represent any standard or combina-
tion of standards that is necessary.

Applying Design Check Sets
A design check set is a collection of one or more design checks. There are four 
types of design checks: line, curve, spiral, and tangent intersection. When a 
design check set is applied to an alignment, Civil 3D flags any violations with a 
triangular yellow shield marked with an exclamation point. You can hover over 
the shield to get more information about the violation, as shown previously in 
Figure 5.15.
Preloading Your Design Standards
If you work for a company that does projects in different jurisdictions that have 
different design requirements, it would be a good idea to talk with your CAD 
manager about separate templates, one for each jurisdiction. Not only can these 
templates establish graphical standards as discussed previously, but they also can 
be set up with preloaded design-criteria files and design check sets that represent 
applicable design standards. With this type of setup, you can simply choose the 
right template before starting your design and proceed with confidence that a 
warning symbol will pop up if you have not met a requirement of the county, 
state, or client for whom you’re designing.
Exercise 5.7: Apply a Design Check Set
In this exercise, you’ll apply a design check set to the Jordan Court alignment 
and then make edits based on the results.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Design Check Set.dwg located in the 
Chapter 05 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment, and then click Alignment

Applying Design Criteria Files
Design criteria files are another way of having Civil 3D check your design as 
you go. From an end-user standpoint, there isn’t much difference between a 
design check set and design criteria file: they’re both something you assign 
to your alignment so that certain design parameters can be checked. From 
a setup standpoint, they’re quite different. Design check sets are a group of 
design checks that are relatively simple and are managed through the Settings 
tab of the Toolspace. A design criteria file is a single file, and it’s potentially 
much more sophisticated. There is a special tool for editing design criteria files 
called the Design Criteria Editor. Civil 3D comes with AASHTO design criteria 
files that can be used as is or copied and modified to meet local requirements. 
Autodesk also provides numerous country kits that include even more design 
criteria files that meet the requirements of various design authorities around 
the world.

Exercise 5.8: Apply a Design Criteria File
In this exercise, you’ll apply a design criteria file to the Jordan Court alignment 
and then make edits based on the results.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Design Criteria Files.dwg located in the 
Chapter 05 class data folder.
Note that currently only one warning symbol is shown for the 
Jordan Court alignment.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment, and select Alignment Properties 
on the ribbon.
	
3.	 Click the Design Criteria tab. Check the box next to Use Design 
Criteria File.
	
4.	 Click the button to the right of the file path, and select the file named 
Autodesk Civil 3D Imperial (2011) Roadway Design Standards 
.xml (Autodesk Civil 3D Metric (2011) Roadway Design 
Standards.xml). Click Open.
	
5.	 Uncheck the box next to Use Design Check Set.
	
6.	 Click OK, and press Esc to clear the grips.
New warning symbols appear on the first, second, and fourth 
curves (the one on the third curve was there previously). As you can 
see, the design criteria file is a bit more stringent than the design 
check set of the previous exercise.
	
7.	 Hover your cursor over the warning symbol farthest to the north.
	
8.	 Select the alignment, and click Geometry Editor on the ribbon.
	
9.	 Click Alignment Grid View on the Alignment Layout Tools 
toolbar.
	
10.	 Note that the minimum radius is listed in Panorama. Change the 
radius of items 2, 3, and 7 to 155 (48).
Do not edit item 5; it should remain set to 50' (15 m).
	
11.	 Close Panorama, and observe the change to the alignment.
	
12.	 Save and close the drawing.

You Have the Power
Design check sets and design criteria files don’t change your design. They simply 
tell you when one of the rules has been broken. Depending on many factors, 
there will be times when you fix the issue to satisfy the rule and times when you 
don’t. In the previous case of the 50' (15 m) radius, you know that Phase II of the 
project will create a T intersection at this location, which makes the sharp turn OK.
Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you have an understanding of alignments: their 
purpose, how to create them, and how to modify them. You’re able to create alignments from 
objects already in the drawing or create them from scratch using the Alignment Creation Tools. 
You can edit alignments graphically and numerically using a number of approaches. These 
include grips, Alignment Editing Tools, Alignment Grid View, and component-level editing. You 
now know how to apply design check sets and design criteria files to enable Civil 3D to keep 
track of how well your design adheres to your standards. Generally speaking, having completed 
this chapter, you’re ready to begin working with alignments in a production environment.

Chapter 6
Displaying and 
Annotating 
Alignments
As you’ll find with nearly every design component you create for a land-
development project, creating the design is only half the job—you must 
also address the graphical appearance and annotation of what you’ve cre-
ated. Alignments serve as the basis for further design of a linear feature, 
but they also serve as a means of expressing the geometry of the feature to 
reviewers and contractors. The alignment by itself doesn’t tell this story in 
enough detail and must therefore be stylized and annotated appropriately. In 
addition, alignments often serve as baselines used to express the location of 
other features within the project.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use various styles and annotations to 
convey important information about alignments.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Apply alignment styles
▶
▶Apply alignment labels and label sets
▶
▶Create station/offset labels
▶
▶Create segment labels
▶
▶Apply tag labels and tables

Using Alignment Styles
As with other styles you have learned about, alignment styles are, as their name 
implies, used to control the appearance and behavior of alignments. By applying 
different styles, you can graphically distinguish between existing centerlines, 
proposed centerlines, and so on. You can even use styles to display an alignment 
as something that is not a centerline at all, such as a property line or even a util-
ity line. Figure 6.1 illustrates how styles enable alignments to represent many 
different things.
F i g u r e   6 . 1    Different alignment styles are used to represent the right-of-way, edges of 
pavement, and centerlines in this drawing.
Alignment styles have two major ways of affecting the appearance of align-
ments. First, they control which components of the alignment are visible, and 
second, they control the graphical properties such as layer, color, and linetype of 
the components that are displayed.
Exercise 6.1: Apply Alignment Styles
In this exercise, you’ll use alignment styles to control the appearance of 
alignments.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Alignment Styles.dwg located in the 
Chapter 06 class data folder.
The drawing contains a dozen different alignments that are 
intended to serve different purposes. Currently, all the alignments 
look the same because they have been assigned a style of Standard.

With this style, markers are placed at the beginning, end, points of 
curvature (PCs), points of tangency (PTs), points of reverse curvature 
(PRCs), and points of intersection (PIs). In addition, line extensions 
are displayed with the tangents extending to the PI markers. You 
would use this style for the polished look of a final plan but probably 
not for design.
	
6.	 Pan south until you can see the Madison Lane alignment. Change 
the style of this alignment to Layout.
	
7.	 For the alignments that run parallel to the Jordan Court centerline 
and extend the full length of the centerline, assign the C-ROAD-
RWAY style.
This displays the alignments on the right-of-way layer, enabling 
them to take on the appearance of property lines.

Applying Alignment Labels and Label Sets
Alignments (and, as you’ll learn later, profiles) have a special kind of annotation 
that is applied either to the entire alignment at once or to a range of stations 
within the alignment. This annotation repeats at specified increments or when 
specific types of geometry are encountered. This type of annotation is very use-
ful because it changes as the alignment changes, even if new geometry is added 
or the length of the alignment changes. In all, you can add seven types of align-
ment labels in this way. This chapter doesn’t cover all seven types, but you’ll 
learn about the following three alignment label types:
Major Station Labels    Placed at the major station increment, which is larger 
than the minor station increment. They typically include a tick mark along with 
a numerical label calling out the station.
Minor Station Labels    Placed at the minor station increment, which is 
smaller than the major station increment. These typically consist of tick marks.
Geometry Point Labels    Placed at key geometric points along the alignment, 
such as the beginning of the alignment, ending of the alignment, places where 
there are curves, and so on.
Exercise 6.2: Apply Labels to Alignments
In this exercise, you’ll use the Add/Edit Station Labels command to add station 
labels, station ticks, and geometry labels to the Jordan Court alignment.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Alignment Labels.dwg located in the

Using Alignment Label Sets
As you might guess, the collection of labels used in the previous exercise is quite 
common: station and tick at the major station, just a tick at the minor station, 
and labels calling out key geometric features. What if you could gather those 
three label types together in a nice, neat package and apply them all at once? 
That’s the exact purpose of a label set.

Editing Alignment Labels
Working with alignment labels is a bit different than working with other labels 
because alignment labels exist in groups. If you click a major station label, for 
example, all the major station labels for the entire alignment will be selected. 
So, what if you want to change something about just one label? The answer is to 
use your Ctrl key when selecting individual labels in a group.
Another type of label edit that you’ll be introduced to in this chapter is flipping. 
Flipping a label simply means switching it over to the other side of the line.
Exercise 6.4: Edit Alignment Labels
In this exercise, you’ll edit the labels for Jordan Court such that the geometry 
labels are moved outside the right-of-way lines. You’ll also flip a geometry point 
label and grip-edit an individual station label to resolve a labeling conflict.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Alignment Labels.dwg located in 
the Chapter 06 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click one of the geometry point labels on the Jordan Court align-
ment. Then click Edit Label Group on the contextual ribbon tab that 
appears.
	
3.	 Click in the Style column to the right of Geometry Points. Select 
Perpendicular With Tick And Line – Offset, and click OK.
F i g u r e   6 . 5    Changing the style of the geometry point labels improves their appearance and

Dragged State
In step 7, when you use a special grip on a label to drag it to a new location, a 
leader magically appears. This happens because the leader is turned on in the 
dragged state configuration of the label style. The dragged state of a label can 
dramatically change the look of that label when it’s dragged to a new location. 
In addition to the appearance of a leader, you might see a change in text height 
or orientation, the appearance of a border around the text, and several other 
changes.
Creating Station/Offset Labels
As mentioned earlier, an alignment is often used as a baseline, enabling other 
features to express their locations in relation to that baseline. This is typically 
done with station offset notations, and, of course, the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® pro-
gram provides you with labels to do just that. This type of label is referred to as 
a station/offset label.
◀
Note how the 0+00 
(0+000) station label 
for Madison Lane is 
conflicting with the 
centerline of Jordan 
Court.

Unlike the label groups you learned about earlier, station/offset labels stand 
alone instead of being part of a set. They are capable of reporting the station and 
offset of a point that you select as well as the alignment name, coordinates of 
the point, and other types of information.
You can create station/offset labels as either fixed or floating labels. If they 
are fixed, then they hold their positions and update the station and offset values 
when the alignment is edited. If they are floating, then they maintain their sta-
tion and offset values and move with the alignment when it’s edited. Like spot 
elevation labels, station/offset labels are paired with a marker.
Exercise 6.5: Create Station/Offset Labels
In this exercise, you’ll add station/offset labels to define the road geometry at the 
intersection of Jordan Court and Madison Lane.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Station Offset Labels.dwg located in the 
Chapter 06 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment, and then click Add Labels ➢ 
Station/Offset – Fixed Point on the contextual ribbon tab.
	
3.	 While holding down the Shift key, right-click and select Endpoint.
	
4.	 Click the northern end of the northern arc. A new label that refer-
ences the Jordan Court alignment is created at this location.
	
5.	 While holding down the Shift key, right-click and select Endpoint. 
Then click the southern end of the southern arc.
	 6.	 Press Esc twice to end the command and clear the selection of the 
alignment. Click the Madison Lane alignment, and then click Add 
Labels ➢ Station/Offset – Fixed Point on the contextual ribbon tab.
	
7.	 While holding down the Shift key, right-click and select Endpoint. 
Click the western end of the northern arc.
	
8.	 While holding down the Shift key, right-click and select Endpoint. 
Then click the western end of the southern arc.
	
9.	 Press Esc twice to end the labeling command and clear the selection 
of the alignment.
	
10.	 Click one of the labels, and then click the square grip and drag it to a 
new location that is clear of other lines and text. Repeat this for the 
other labels to improve their appearance and readability.

Creating Segment Labels
So far, you have seen label groups that label the entire alignment at once and 
station/offset labels that are typically used to label something other than the 
alignment. What about the individual parts of the alignment? How do you tell 
reviewers and contractors how to re-create those alignments in the field? The 
answer is segment labels. Segment labels allow you to label things such as bear-
ings, distances, and curve data. By providing this information as text in the 
drawing, you give viewers of the drawing the information they need to stake out 
the alignment in the field. You’re also sharing information about the geometric 
“performance” of the alignment that might answer questions such as these: Are 
the curves too sharp for the expected speed? Is the alignment parallel to other 
important features? Are intersecting roads perpendicular to one another?
Segment labels stand alone like station/offset labels; however, you can create 
them in bulk if you so desire. For example, all the tangents of an entire align-
ment can be labeled at once if you choose that option when creating the labels.

Exercise 6.6: Create Segment Labels
In this exercise, you’ll add segment labels to define bearing, distance, and curve 
information for the Madison Lane and Jordan Court alignments.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Segment Labels.dwg located in the 
Chapter 06 class data folder.
	 2.	 Click the Madison Lane alignment, and then click Add Labels ➢ Add 
Alignment Labels.
	
3.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Label Type, select Single Segment.
	
b.	 For Line Label Style, verify that Bearing Over Distance is 
selected.
	
c.	 For Curve Label Style, verify that Curve Data is selected, and 
then click Add.
	
4.	 Zoom in, and click one of the tangents of Madison Lane.
Notice the bearing and distance label that is created.
	
5.	 Press Esc to end the labeling command. Click the newly created label, 
and then click Flip Label on the ribbon.
This swaps the position of the bearing and distance.
	
6.	 Select the label again, and this time select Reverse Label.
	
7.	 Click Add in the Add Labels dialog box. Then click the curve and 
the other tangent of Madison Lane to create two more labels in the 
drawing.
	
8.	 Press Esc to end the labeling command. Click the curve label, and 
then click the label’s square grip and drag it to a clear location in the 
drawing.
	
9.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, change Label Type to Multiple Segment. 
Change Curve Label Style back to Curve Data.
	
10.	 Click Add, and then click anywhere on the Jordan Court alignment.
All tangents and curves are labeled at once.

Why Be a Bear about Bearings?
If this is the first time you’ve seen bearings, you may not know what is going on 
here. A bearing is a way of expressing the direction of a line. In this exercise, the 
bearing of the eastern tangent of Madison Lane is S67°27'02.54"W. That means if 
you face south and then turn yourself toward the west about 67°, you’ll be facing 
roughly in the direction that this line is pointing. Because there are 90° between 
south and west, you’ll actually be facing more west than south.
When the bearing is reversed, it’s like you’ve done an about-face and you’re now 
facing 67° east of north. This doesn’t change the appearance of the line, and it 
might seem picky to distinguish between SW and NE in this case. But when you 
think about it, the stationing of this road is increasing in a certain direction (west 
in the case of Madison Lane), which establishes the direction of the alignment. 
For consistency, it’s a good idea for the direction of your bearing labels to agree 
with the direction of your alignment.

Using Tag Labels and Tables
Sometimes, it’s better to put all the geometric data for an alignment in a table 
rather than labeling it right on the alignment itself. This can clear up a clut-
tered drawing and provide space for other types of annotations. You can accom-
plish this in Civil 3D by using tag labels and tables.
A tag label is a special kind of label that assigns a number to a curve, tangent, 
or spiral. Common examples are C1, S1, and L1 for a curve, spiral, and tangent, 
respectively. Tag labels can be created ahead of time if you know you’re going to use 
a table, or you can convert regular labels to tag labels on the fly. In fact, you can 
convert just a few of the labels to tag labels and use a combination of a table and 
in-place labels to convey alignment information. This is common in cases where 
certain segments of an alignment are too short to have a label fit on them nicely.
As Murphy’s Law would have it, the numbers you get when creating tag labels 
are almost never what you want them to be. This is no fault of the software; in 
fact, the reason for this happening so frequently is that the software is doing its 
job. Each time you create a tag label, Civil 3D bumps the next tag number up by 
one. Because most designs are laid out and labeled more than once (lots more, in 
most cases), your next tag number is likely to be set to something other than 1.
Fortunately, Civil 3D is quite good at enabling you to correct your tag labels. 
There is even a Renumber Tags command designed for that specific purpose.
Exercise 6.7: Create Tag Labels
In this exercise, you’ll create and renumber tag labels for the Jordan Court 
alignment.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Tag Labels.dwg located in the Chapter 06 
class data folder.
	 2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment, and then click Add Labels ➢ Add 
Alignment Labels on the contextual ribbon tab.
	
3.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, select Multiple Segment as the label 
type.
	
4.	 Verify that Circle Tag is selected for both Line Label Style and Curve 
Label Style.

Creating Tables
Once you have created all the tag labels and numbered them correctly, you’re 
ready to create a table. Civil 3D provides four types of alignment tables that you 
can insert into your drawing: line, curve, spiral, and segment. A segment table is 
a combination of the other three tables.
◀
There are eight tags in 
all: L1–L4 and C1–C4.

1 2 8  
C h ap t e r  6  • D i s p l ay i n g  a n d A nn o t at i n g A l i g nm e nt s
When you create a table in your drawing, you have full control over which data 
is included in it. You can choose to provide table data for the entire alignment, you 
can tell Civil 3D to seek out certain label styles and include them in your table, or 
you can handpick the labels from the drawing by selecting them directly.
As you’ll find with all Civil 3D tables, they are dynamically linked to the 
objects for which they display data. In the case of alignments, as the alignment 
is modified, the table updates automatically. There is even an option to create 
additional table entries as new tangents, curves, or spirals are created in the 
process of editing. Imagine how much time is saved by not having to go back 
and check all the numbers in a table each time an alignment is tweaked.
Exercise 6.8: Create a Table
In this exercise, you’ll create a table for the tag labels you created and renum-
bered in the previous exercise.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Create Table.dwg located in the Chapter 06 
class data folder.
	 2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment, and then click Add Tables ➢ Add 
Segments on the contextual ribbon tab.
	
3.	 In the Alignment Table Creation dialog box, click the Select By Label 
Or Style option.
	
4.	 If you’re unable to read the label style names, click and drag the 
lower-right corner of the dialog box to the right to increase its size. 
Then click and drag the line between the Label Style Name and 
Selection Rule column headings to widen the Label Style Name col-
umn. Repeat these actions as needed until you can see the full names 
of the label styles listed.
	
5.	 Check the boxes in the Apply column for Alignment Curve: Circle Tag 
and Alignment Line: Circle Tag.
	
6.	 Click OK. Click a point in an open area of the drawing to insert the table.
The table reflects the geometric data for the alignment (see Figure 6.9).

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you’re able to annotate alignments. You can apply 
styles to change the appearance and content of alignment labels that already exist in a drawing. 
You can apply groups of labels to handle stationing, tick marks, and geometry points through-
out an entire alignment. You know how to leverage label sets so that you can be more efficient 
when using the same label configurations with multiple alignments. You can label individual 
points of interest with station/offset labels and convey even more geometric information using 
segment labels. When drawings become too cluttered, you can use tag labels and tables to 
provide a clean and organized approach for displaying information about an alignment. Now 
that you have completed this chapter, you’re ready to begin creating and modifying alignment 
labels and tables in a production environment. 


Chapter 7
Designing Vertically 
Using Profiles
Now that the paths of the roads have been established as alignments 
representing their centerlines, we’ll look at the answers to these questions: 
What will it be like to travel along those paths? Will the terrain be steep 
or flat? Will it change much from one end of the road to the other? Will it 
require earth to be moved to smooth out the bumps in the road?
In Chapter 4, “Modeling the Existing Terrain Using Surfaces,” you learned 
how existing ground surfaces can be used to analyze the shape of the 
ground. Although surfaces can be quite effective for this purpose, you’re 
looking for something that tells you specifically what the terrain is like in 
relation to the road alignment. Once you have learned that, you’ll be looking 
for an effective way to redesign the terrain to create a nice, smooth road.
Whether you’re analyzing the terrain along an alignment or redesigning 
it, the tool that is most effective is the profile. Profiles allow you to show a 
slice through the ground along a specific alignment. This provides you with 
a clear and direct visualization of changes in terrain so that you can assess 
existing conditions and improve your design if necessary.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Create surface profiles
▶
▶Display profiles in profile views
▶
▶Create design profiles
▶
▶Edit profiles

▶Apply design check sets and criteria files

Creating Surface Profiles
One of the first steps in designing the vertical aspect of a linear feature is to analyze 
the shape of the existing terrain along that feature. You’ve learned how surfaces are 
used to create 3D models of the shape of the ground. You’ve also learned that there 
are many potential uses for surfaces other than displaying contours or labeling spot 
elevations. One of these uses is the creation of profiles from surface data, which 
helps with the design of linear features such as roads, channels, pipelines, and so on.
When a profile is created based on the data within a surface, it’s aptly named 
a surface profile. A surface profile maintains a dynamic link to the surface it 
references. In fact, a surface profile is tied to both the alignment and the surface 
used to create it. If either one changes, the surface profile is updated.
Exercise 7.1: Create a Surface Profile
In this exercise, you’ll create a surface profile along the Jordan Court alignment.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Surface Profile.dwg located in the 
Chapter 07 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court alignment in the drawing, and then click 
Surface Profile on the contextual ribbon tab.
	
3.	 In the Create Profile From Surface dialog box, verify that Jordan 
Court is selected as the alignment.
	
4.	 Under Select Surfaces, select EG. Click Add, and then click OK.
	
5.	 In Prospector, expand Alignments ➢ Centerline Alignments ➢ Jordan 
Court ➢ Profiles. You should see EG – Surface (1) listed under Profiles.
You should also notice a small orange triangle next to Jordan 
Court. This indicates that there are objects in the drawing that are 
dependent on this alignment. In this case, the dependent object is 
the profile you just created.
	
6.	 Right-click EG – Surface (1) and select Properties.
	
7.	 On the Information tab of the Profile Properties dialog box, change 
Name to Jordan Court EGCL. Click OK.
Although Prospector shows you that a profile has been created, you 
have nothing graphical to view. To display a graphical representation 
of the profile in your drawing, you need a profile view, which takes us 
to the next section.

Displaying Profiles in Profile Views
In the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software, you must use a profile view to display a 
profile. A profile view is basically a grid that represents stations in the x direc-
tion and elevations in the y direction. The stations along the alignment and 
their corresponding elevations are plotted on this grid, and the resulting line 
represents changes in the terrain along the alignment. The profile view also 
includes various types of labels, such as axis labels and axis titles, to provide 
context to the display of the profile. Profile views can be further augmented with 
bands, which will be covered in Chapter 8, “Displaying and Annotating Profiles.”
Exercise 7.2: Create a Profile View
In this exercise, you’ll create a profile view to display the surface profile that you

Now you have your first look at the nature of the terrain along the Jordan 
Court alignment. As you study the profile, you see a relatively flat area at the 
beginning, a fairly steep drop into a low area, and then a gradual rise for the 
remaining third of the alignment. The appearance of the line is somewhat jag-
ged, which indicates moderately rough terrain. In just a short time, you have 
created a graphical depiction of what it would be like to travel down the path of 
the road as it exists right now. From this image, you can begin to visualize the 
adjustments that will be needed to create a smooth and safe driving experience.
Creating Design Profiles
Earlier, you used a surface profile to determine the nature of the existing ter-
rain along the path of Jordan Court. As the surface profile shows, the current 
state of this path isn’t suitable for driving, so it must be transformed into some-
thing with much more subtle geometry. In other words, a new profile must be 
designed for the road. In Civil 3D, this type of profile is often referred to as a 
design profile or layout profile.
Like alignments, design profiles consist of straight-line segments (called 
tangents) and the curves that connect them. The curve geometry is a bit dif-
ferent, but essentially you can think of a design profile as an alignment turned 
on its side. The process of laying out a profile is very similar to laying out an 
alignment, right down to the Profile Layout Tools toolbar, which bears a strik-
ing resemblance to the Alignment Layout Tools toolbar.

Profile Terminology
Familiarizing yourself with the following terms will be helpful as you work with 
design profiles:
Tangent    The straight-line portions of a profile.
PVI (Point of Vertical Intersection)    The location where two tangents 
intersect.
PVC (Point of Vertical Curvature)    The beginning of a vertical curve.
PVT (Point of Vertical Tangency)    The end of a vertical curve.
Parabolic Curve    A vertical curve that doesn’t have a constant radius and 
follows the shape of a parabola.
Circular Curve    A vertical curve that has a constant radius.
Asymmetric Curve    A vertical curve that is created from two back-to-back 
parabolic curves.
Crest Curve    A vertical curve at the top of a hill where the grade leading into 
the curve is greater than the grade leading out. The PVI is located above the curve.
Sag Curve    A vertical curve at the bottom of a valley where the grade leading 
into the curve is less than the grade leading out. The PVI is located below the curve.

Editing Profiles
As you learned in Chapter 5, “Designing in 2D Using Alignments,” it is common 
(and often recommended) to lay out a rough version of a design and then apply 
a series of refinements to achieve the final design. This is especially true with 
profiles because the first pass is usually an attempt to match existing ground as 
closely as possible without creating too many of your own bumps in the road. 
Why try to match existing ground? Quite simply, it’s cheaper. The closer your 
new road matches the existing terrain, the less earth will need to be moved to 
construct it. The cost of moving earth is measured by the volume of earth that 
is excavated, so less digging equals less cost.
After you create the initial profile that roughly matches existing ground, 
you must then refine the design based on various factors such as performance 
requirements for the road, avoiding overhead and underground obstacles, and 
ensuring that rainwater will drain properly. Many times, the adjustments you 
make are based not only on your own ideas but also on the input of others 
involved in the project. Whatever the case, a good set of tools for editing profiles 
is going to come in handy. Civil 3D provides a robust set of tools for editing pro-
files graphically and numerically.

Exercise 7.4: Edit a Profile with Grips
In yet another respect, profiles are similar to alignments in that they come 
equipped with specialized grips that enable editing to be done efficiently. In this 
exercise, you’ll use grips to edit the Jordan Court design profile.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Graphical Editing.dwg located in the 
Chapter 07 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the blue Jordan Court FGCL profile to display its grips. Click 
the upright triangular grip located in the circle marked A1, and drag 
it to the center of the circle marked A2, as shown in Figure 7.3.

This is an example of 
moving the PVI grip, 
which changes the

the curve tangent at 
both ends.

This type of grip moves 
the PVI along the slope 
of one of the tangents.

Profile Locking
You may wonder what happens to a profile when the alignment is edited. For 
surface profiles, the answer is simple: the profile updates to match the new path 
of the alignment. For design profiles, the answer is a little more complicated due 
to a feature called profile locking. You’ll find this feature as a tab on the Profile 
Properties dialog. With this feature, you can link profile geometry with align-
ment geometry, and Civil 3D will attempt to keep key features of both aligned.
Exercise 7.5: Edit a Profile Using the Profile 
Layout Tools
Grips are wonderful tools for editing geometry that is already there, but what 
if you need to add a PVI or draw a curve? For that, you need the Profile Layout 
Tools toolbar (see Figure 7.8). This toolbar is the same one you would use to cre-
ate a profile initially.

Exercise 7.6: Edit a Profile Using Profile  
Grid View
At times, you may want to adjust your design by telling Civil 3D the exact 
dimension of a portion of the profile. You can do this in one of two different 
ways. The first is using Profile Grid View, which opens a tab in Panorama. This 
tab shows the geometry of the profile in table form and enables you to edit some 
of the values to adjust the design. The second way, using component-level edit-
ing, will be covered in the next exercise.
In this exercise, you’ll use Profile Grid View to make some edits to the PVI sta-
tions and elevations of the Jordan Court design profile.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile Grid View.dwg located in the 
Chapter 07 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court FGCL profile, and then click Geometry Editor 
on the ribbon.
	
3.	 Click Profile Grid View to open the Profile Entities tab and display the 
numerical version of the profile geometry.
	
4.	 Change the Station value for Item 3 to 2+70.00 (0+080.00) and the 
PVI Elevation value to 188.00 (57.00). 
	
5.	 Change the remaining items as follows:
Item
Station
PVI Elevation
4
8+55.00 (0+260)
196.50 (60.0)
5
10+50.00 (0+320)

Keep It Simple
As you might have guessed, the main objective of Exercise 7.6 is simplification 
of the profile design. In most cases, the stations or elevations don’t need to be 
located with a precision of 0.01, so why not round them off to nice, even num-
bers? The contractor and surveyor who are staking out the design in the field 
will appreciate this rounding because there will be fewer digits to keep track of 
and a bit less potential for error.
The PVIs of items 1, 2, and 9 were not rounded because these are specific loca-
tions and elevations that need to be met. Items 7 and 8 were already entered 
as round numbers when you used the Insert PVIs – Tabular command in the 
previous exercise.
Exercise 7.7: Edit a Profile Using  
Component-Level Editing
The second method for editing the profile design numerically is referred to as 
component-level editing. With this approach, you open the numerical data for a 
piece of the profile (such as a line or vertical curve) in a separate window. You do 
this by clicking the Sub-entity Editor button on the Profile Layout Tools toolbar 
and then using the Pick Sub-entity tool to choose the part of the profile you 
want to edit.
In this exercise, you’ll use component-level editing to make some more 
changes to the Jordan Court design profile.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile Component Level Editing.dwg 
located in the Chapter 07 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court profile, and then click Geometry Editor on 
the ribbon.

Using Design Check Sets and Criteria Files
You first learned about design criteria files and check sets in Chapter 5. These 
two features enable you to check your design on the fly to catch any errors or 
design flaws as you work. Of course, what’s considered right can differ from 
place to place and from design type to design type, so these checking tools are 
customizable. The task of setting them up is usually left to a CAD manager or 
one of the top CAD users in your company or organization. This is true of most 
Civil 3D customizations.
As discussed in Chapter 5, the actual details of how design criteria files and 
check sets are configured can be driven by government entities, such as a 
department of transportation or planning commission, or according to your 
own personal design standards or those adopted by your company. Whatever the 
case, you should be careful not to rely on them 100 percent. Even while using 
design criteria files and check sets, a solid understanding of design principles 
is a must. These tools are just a way of making sure you’re applying what you 
already know, not a substitute for knowing it in the first place.
Exercise 7.8: Apply a Design Check Set
As you learned earlier, a design check set is a collection of one or more design 
checks. For profiles, there are two types of design checks: line and curve. When 
a design check set is applied to a profile, Civil 3D flags any violations with a

disappear, indicating that you have satisfied the design check for both 
tangents.

Exercise 7.9: Apply a Design Criteria File
As you did with alignments, you can assign design criteria files to a profile. The 
general behavior of design criteria files is the same as it is for design checks: 
they display warning symbols when certain design parameters aren’t met. 
However, behind the scenes, design criteria files are much more sophisticated 
than design check sets, and you can use them to check more types of geometric 
criteria.
In this exercise, you’ll apply a design criteria file to the Jordan Court profile 
and then make some edits to address design violations.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Design Criteria File.dwg located in the 
Chapter 07 class data folder.

What’s So Special about K?
The K value is a way of expressing the abruptness of a vertical curve. If you’ve 
ever been driving on a country road and caught air at the top of a hill or smacked 
your head on the dashboard at the bottom of a hill, then you’ve experienced a K 
value that is too low for your speed. The K value is calculated as a ratio between 
the curve length and the change in grade. Longer, more subtle curves have a 
higher K value, which equates to greater safety because the change in grade is 
spread out over a longer distance.
Headlight sight distance is an important design parameter for all road designs. If 
the peaks and valleys of the road don’t allow headlights to illuminate obstacles 
within an acceptable distance, then the road is considered unsafe. The accept-
able distance varies based on design speed. Obstacles need to be detected much 
farther away at higher design speeds to allow the driver enough time to react.
Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you’re able to create, display, analyze, and modify 
profiles—both existing and proposed. You can show the nature of the existing terrain along 
an alignment by creating a surface profile and showing it in a profile view. You can construct 
the proposed elevations of a road or other item by creating a design profile. Once the design 
profile is in place, you know how to edit it using a variety of tools—some graphical, some 
command driven, and some numerical. You can check your design by applying design check sets 
and design criteria files and then make edits to address violations reported by those features. 
You’re ready to begin working with profiles on real projects in a production environment.

Chapter 8
Displaying and 
Annotating Profiles
Now that you have captured the nature of the existing ground along the 
road centerlines using surface profiles, and you have reshaped it using layout 
profiles, it’s time to specify how you intend your design to be built. A wavy 
line in the drawing simply isn’t enough information for a contractor to start 
building your design. You need to provide specific geometric information 
about the profile so that it can be re-created in the field. This is done with 
various types of annotations available in the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software.
It’s also important that the framework in which the profiles are displayed 
is properly configured. As you learned in the previous chapter, the grid lines 
and grid annotations behind your profiles form a profile view. In this chap-
ter, you’ll look at applying different profile view styles to control what infor-
mation about your profiles is displayed and in what manner.
Finally, it’s often necessary to show other things in a profile view that might 
impact the construction of whatever the profile represents. Pipe crossings, 
underground structures, rock layers, and many other features may need to be 
displayed so that you can avoid them or integrate your design with them. One 
way of showing these items in your profile view is through a Civil 3D function 
called object projection.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Change the display of profiles with profile styles
▶
▶Configure profile views using profile view styles
▶
▶Share information through profile view bands
▶
▶Add detail using profile labels
▶
▶Work efficiently using profile label sets

Applying Profile Styles
As with any object style, you can use profile styles to show profiles in different 
ways for different purposes. Specifically, you can use profile styles to affect the 
appearance of profiles in three basic ways. The first is to control which compo-
nents of the profile are visible. You might be surprised to know that there are 
potentially eight different components of a profile, and you can change a pro-
file’s appearance dramatically by changing the visibility of those components. 
The second is to control the graphical properties of the components, such as 
layer, color, linetype, and so on. Finally, a profile style enables you to control the 
display of markers at key geometric points along the profile. Once again, you 
might be surprised at the number of types of points that can be marked along a 
profile: there are 11 of them.
Exercise 8.1: Apply Profile Styles
In this exercise, you’ll assign different profile styles to a profile and observe the 
different ways profiles can be represented.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile Styles.dwg located in the 
Chapter 08 class data folder.
Because the majority of the work in this chapter is done in profile 
view, the drawings aren’t set up with multiple viewports.
	 2.	 In the Jordan Court profile view, click the red existing-ground profile, 
and then click Profile Properties on the ribbon.
	
3.	 On the Information tab of the Profile Properties dialog box, change 
the style to _No Display. Then click OK.
The profile disappears from view.
Using a Style to Hide an Object
In step 3 of Exercise 8.1, you use the style _No Display to hide the profile—some-
thing you might normally do by turning off or freezing a layer. This method of 
making things disappear via style is used quite a bit in Civil 3D. In fact, if you 
look in the stock template that ships with Civil 3D, you’ll see a _No Display style 
for nearly every object type.

Using this approach has a couple of advantages over turning layers on and off. 
First, many Civil 3D objects have multiple components that can be displayed on 
different layers. Changing one style is more efficient than changing several lay-
ers, so it becomes easier and quicker to control the visibility of components by 
style. Second, you may not know which layer or layers need to be turned off to 
make the object disappear from view. By simply applying the _No Display style, 
you make the items disappear without considering layers at all.
	
4.	 Press Esc to clear the selection of the existing ground profile. Then 
click the black design profile for Jordan Court. Right-click, and select 
Properties.
	
5.	 In the Properties window, change the Style property to Layout, and 
press Esc to clear the grips.
The profile now shows curves and lines as different colors and 
includes markers that clearly indicate where there are key geometry 
points (see Figure 8.1). This might be helpful while you’re in the pro-
cess of laying out the profile, but it may not work well when you’re 
using the profile to create a final drawing.
F i g u r e   8 . 1    The Layout profile style displays lines and curves with different 
colors as well as markers at key geometric locations. 
	
6.	 Select the Jordan Court profile again. In the Properties window, 
change the style to Basic.

You can also use 
the specific Profile 
Properties command 
to access the style 
assignment. To show it 
a different way, how-
ever, in step 5 you use 
the generic Properties 
command instead.
This is a very simple 
style that shows just 
the basic geometry 
with no markers or 
color differences.

Applying Profile View Styles
Styles are especially important when you’re working with profile views because

Exercise 8.2: Apply Profile View Styles
In this exercise, you’ll assign different profile view styles and observe how they 
can change the way profile information is presented.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile View Style.dwg located in the 
Chapter 08 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click one of the grid lines of the Jordan Court profile view, right-
click, and select Properties.
	
3.	 In the Properties window, change the style to Major & Minor Grids 
10V. Press Esc to clear the selection.
Note the additional grid lines that appear (see Figure 8.3).
F i g u r e   8 . 3    Additional grid lines displayed as a result of applying the Major & 
Minor Grids 10V profile view style
	
4.	 Select the profile view grid, and change the style to Major Grids 5V.
With this change, the vertical exaggeration is reduced to 5. This 
makes the profile appear much flatter.
	
5.	 Change the style to Major Grids 1V.
It’s OK to Exaggerate Sometimes
Vertical exaggeration is a common practice used to display information in profile 
view. In most places, the earth is relatively flat, and changes in elevation are 
subtle. To make the peaks and valleys stand out a bit more, the elevations are 
exaggerated while the horizontal distances are kept the same. The result is a 
profile that appears to have higher high points, lower low points, and steeper 
slopes in between. This makes the terrain easier to visualize and analyze.

done so, download 
and install the files for 
Chapter 8 according to 
the instructions in this 
book’s Introduction.
◀
10V refers to a vertical 
exaggeration that is 
10 times that of the 
horizontal. Note that in 
the Properties window, 
the current profile view 
style is named Major 
Grids 10V.
◀
This displays the profile 
in its true form, as it 
really exists in the 
field. Think about 
which profile would 
be easier to work with: 
the exaggerated one, 
where the peaks and 
valleys are obvious, or 
this one, which is true 
to scale but much more 
difficult to analyze?

When this technique is used, you’ll likely see a pair of scales assigned to the 
drawing: one that represents the horizontal scale and one that represents the 
vertical scale. For example, a drawing that has a horizontal scale of 1" = 50' and 
a vertical scale of 1" = 5' is employing a vertical exaggeration factor of 10. For a 
metric example, a horizontal drawing scale of 1:500 and a vertical drawing scale 
of 1:50 also achieves a vertical exaggeration of 10.
The following three profile views have a vertical exaggeration of 10, 5, and 1, from 
left to right. The same existing ground profile is shown as a red line in all three.
	
6.	 Change the style of the profile view to DOT.
This is an example of how the graphical standards of a client or 
review agency can be built into your Civil 3D standard styles, making 
it easy to meet the requirements of others.

Applying Profile View Bands
Profile view bands can be added to a profile view along the top or bottom axis. 
You can use these bands to provide additional textual or graphical informa-
tion about a profile. They can be configured to provide this information at even 
increments or at specific locations along the profile.

Exercise 8.3: Apply Profile View Bands
In this exercise, you’ll configure bands for the Jordan Court profile view so 
that information about stations, elevations, and horizontal geometry can be 
displayed.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile View Bands.dwg located in the 
Chapter 08 class data folder.

change Object Style to Major & Minor Grids 10V.
	
4.	 Click the Bands tab. Verify that Profile Data is selected as Band Type.
	
5.	 Under Select Band Style, choose Elevations And Stations.  
Then click Add.
	
6.	 In the Geometry Points To Label In Band dialog box, on the Profile 
Points tab, select Jordan Court EGCL as Profile 1, as shown in 
Figure 8.4. Click OK.
A new entry is added to the list of bands.

see the Profile 2 column. Click the cell in this column, and select 
Jordan Court FGCL.
	
8.	 Click OK to dismiss the Profile View Properties dialog box and return 
to the drawing. Zoom in to the bottom of the profile view.
Across the bottom of the profile view, there is now a band that 
labels the stations and elevations at even increments (see Figure 8.5).

11.	 Under Select Band Style, choose Geometry, and click Add.
Band Sets
Right after step 11 you could have clicked Save As Band Set and stored the two 
bands as a new band set. This band set could then be imported into another 
profile view at a later time. This feature is handy when you repeatedly use the 
same list of bands, enabling you to avoid rebuilding the list each time.
	
12.	 Click OK to dismiss the dialog box and return to the drawing.
The new band is a graphical representation of the alignment geom-
etry. Upward bumps in the band represent curves to the right, and 
downward bumps represent curves to the left. The beginning and 
ending of each bump correspond with the beginning and ending of 
the associated curve. There are also labels that provide more specifics 
about the horizontal geometry.

Applying Profile Labels
Profile labels are similar to alignment labels. They’re applied to the entire profile 
or to a range within the profile, and they show up wherever they encounter the 
things they’re supposed to label. For example, if a vertical curve label is applied 
to a profile that has three vertical curves, then three vertical curve labels will 
appear. This approach offers two advantages. The first is that you can label 
multiple instances of a geometric feature with one command. This becomes 
significant when you’re working on a long stretch of road with dozens of verti-
cal curves. The other advantage is that labels appear as new geometric features 
are added. Continuing to use vertical curves as an example, if you apply a verti-
cal curve label to a profile, curve labels will appear or disappear automatically 
whenever you create or delete vertical curves.
Exercise 8.4: Apply Profile Labels
In this exercise, you’ll configure the labels for the Jordan Court design profile so 
that tangent grades and curve data are labeled.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile Labels.dwg located in the 
Chapter 08 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Jordan Court FGCL profile, and then click Edit  
Profile Labels on the ribbon.

Creating and Applying Profile Label Sets
In the previous exercise, you used several types of profile labels to annotate the 
design profile for Jordan Court. Each one had to be selected and added to the 
list of labels, making this a multistep process. A profile label set enables you to 
store a list of labels for use on another profile. The settings for each label—such 
as weeding, major station, minor station, and so on—can also be stored in the 
label set. This is quite helpful if you use the same profile labels for multiple pro-
files. A label set can even be stored in your company template so it’s always there 
for you to use.
Exercise 8.5: Apply Profile Label Sets
In this exercise, you’ll use a label set to capture the label configuration for 
Jordan Court and apply it easily to Logan Court.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Profile Label Set.dwg located in the 
Chapter 08 class data folder.

Creating Profile View Labels
You have just seen how useful profile labels can be because they are applied to 
the entire profile and continuously watch for new geometric properties to label. 
However, this dynamic nature may not be ideal in certain situations, or you may 
need to provide annotation in your profile view that isn’t related to any profiles 
in that view. Profile view labels are the solution in this case.
Profile view labels are directly linked to the profile view: the grid, grid label-
ing, and bands that serve as the backdrop for one or more profiles. Because of 
this, you can use labels that are independent of any profiles. For example, you 
might use a station and offset label to call out the location of an underground 
obstruction crossing through the profile view. Because this object isn’t directly 
affected by any profile in the drawing, it wouldn’t make sense to associate this 
label with a profile. Instead, you would use a profile view label that is specifically 
intended for this object.
Three types of profile view labels are available in Civil 3D: station elevation, 
depth, and projection. You’ll work with the first two in the next exercise, and the 
third will be covered later in this chapter.

Remember Exaggeration?
The roughly 1-foot (0.3-meter) depth shown by the label might seem small to 
you, based on the dramatic plunge of the V in the profile. Remember that this 
profile view is exaggerated in the vertical aspect by a factor of 10. If you were 
to measure this same depth using the DISTANCE command, you would get 
about 10 feet (3 meters). Profile view labels automatically factor in the vertical 
exaggeration of your profile view.

Projecting Objects to Profile Views
At times, it may be necessary or helpful to show more in a profile view than just 
the existing and finished profiles of your design. Features such as underground 
pipes, overhead cables, trees, fences, and so on may be obstacles that you need 
to avoid or features that you need to integrate into your design. Whatever the 
case, Civil 3D object projection enables you to quickly represent a variety of 
objects in your profile view and provide the accompanying annotation.
Projecting Linear Objects
When you project an object to a profile view, different things can happen 
depending on the type of object you have chosen. For linear objects such as 3D 
polylines, feature lines, and survey figures, the projected version of the object is 
still linear, but it will appear distorted unless it’s parallel to the alignment. This 
can be a bit tough to envision, but just imagine a light being shone from behind 
the object in the direction of the alignment. The projection of this object seen in 
a profile view would be somewhat like the shadow cast by the object. The parts 
of it that are parallel to the alignment would appear full length, and the parts 
that aren’t parallel would appear shortened.
Based on the settings you choose, the elevations that are applied to a projected 
linear object can vary. For linear objects that are already drawn in 3D, you can 
choose to use the object elevations as they are. For 2D objects that need to have 
elevations provided, the elevations can be derived from a surface or profile.
Projecting Blocks and Points
Objects that indicate location—such as AutoCAD points, Civil 3D points, and 
blocks—are handled a bit differently than linear objects. They are represented 
with markers or as a projected version of the way they are drawn in plan view. 
This can lead to a distorted view of such objects because of the common practice 
of applying a vertical exaggeration to the profile view. The options for assigning 
elevations to these types of projections are the same as the options for linear 
objects, with one addition: the ability to provide an elevation manually. This 
allows you to specify the elevation graphically or numerically, independent of a 
surface, a profile, or the actual elevation of the object you’ve selected.

12+00 (0+360). These are caused by the alignment turning away from 
the water pipe at this location, which produces some odd projection 
angles and distorts the projected appearance of the water pipe.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you can configure and label profiles so that they 
display information the way you need it to be displayed. You can apply profile styles and pro-
file view styles to change the appearance of the graphical information. You can add bands to 
show additional information about the design in profile view. You’re now able to add labels to 
convey detailed information about your profile design. And finally, you can project objects to 
your profile views, placing them in a useful context so their proximity with other objects in the 
design model can be assessed. You’re ready to begin configuring, annotating, and enhancing 
profiles in a production environment.


Chapter 9
Designing in 3D 
Using Corridors
Long before AutoCAD® Civil 3D® objects, CAD, or even computers 
existed, engineers were designing roads and other linear features in three 
stages: alignment, profile, and cross section. I suspect the reason for this 
is that it’s much easier to think of a design one dimension at a time rather 
than think of all three dimensions at once. This was especially true before 
designs could be visualized in 3D on a computer screen. This approach to 
linear design has carried right through to the present day and is still evi-
dent, even with cutting-edge technology such as Civil 3D. 
You have already learned about the alignment and profile stages of this 
design approach. In this chapter, you’ll learn how assemblies are used to 
provide the third stage of the design process: the cross section. Then you’ll 
combine all three elements (alignments, profiles, and assemblies) to take 
this three-stage design process to the next level: a dynamic three-dimen-
sional model.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

that are dynamically linked to one another. A good way to begin understanding 
how corridors work is to study how these different components come together 
to become a 3D representation of your design.
Understanding the 3D Chain
In Chapter 5, “Designing in 2D Using Alignments,” you used alignments to design 
the 2D path of a linear feature, in this case a road. In Chapter 7, “Designing 
Vertically Using Profiles,” you designed the vertical path of the road using profiles. 
When combined, the alignment and profile form a three-dimensional pathway 
called a 3D chain. The 3D chain serves as the backbone of your design.
3D chains can actually be seen in your drawing, but only if you view the draw-
ing from a 3D perspective, as shown in Figure 9.1.
F i g u r e   9 . 1    The blue lines represent 3D chains formed by combining alignments with 
profiles to form a three-dimensional pathway.
Because the 3D chain is dynamically linked to both the alignment and profile, 
a change to either one will automatically prompt a change to the 3D chain and 
subsequently update the corridor.
Understanding the Assembly
An assembly is a representation of the cross-sectional geometry of the feature 
you’re designing. It establishes the overall shape of the cross section and distin-
guishes the areas within it. For example, a typical road cross section can have areas 
of asphalt pavement, base material, curbs, and sidewalks, as shown in Figure 9.2.

F i g u r e   9 . 2    A Civil 3D assembly that establishes lanes, curbs, sidewalks, and grading
The parts of an assembly are called subassemblies. They are dynamically linked 
to one another and therefore have the potential to affect one another. For exam-
ple, if a curb subassembly is located at the edge of a lane subassembly, the curb 
subassembly will automatically move outward if the lane width is increased.
Understanding Assembly Insertions
To create a corridor, Civil 3D inserts instances of an assembly along a 3D chain at 
regular intervals. These assembly insertions can be thought of as the ribs of the 
3D model, providing shape to the road one assembly at a time (see Figure 9.3).
F i g u r e   9 . 3    Assemblies inserted at intervals along a 3D chain
Because the assembly insertions are dynamically linked to the 3D chain, any 
change to the alignment or profile will prompt a change in the corridor. The 
assembly insertions are also dynamically linked to the assembly itself, so any 
change to the assembly will also prompt an update to the corridor.

Understanding Corridor Feature Lines
To provide a framework in the longitudinal direction, Civil 3D draws feature lines 
from assembly to assembly (see Figure 9.4). The feature lines employ a coding system 
to determine which points they are drawn through each time they cross an assembly.
F i g u r e   9 . 4    The red lines are feature lines that connect like points on each assembly insertion.
The feature lines are linked to the assembly insertions, which are linked to the 
3D chain, and so on. I’ll stop calling out relationships specifically and cover it all 
by saying that everything within a corridor is essentially related.
Understanding the Corridor Surface
As you view the assembly insertions along the 3D chain previously shown in 
Figure 9.3, imagine this as the structural framework of a ship or an airplane. With 
the framework in place, now imagine the hull or fuselage being installed on the 
vessel. This is a great way to envision the role of a corridor surface (see Figure 9.5).

Although they appear in Prospector like other surfaces, corridor surfaces are 
built directly from the corridor and maintain a link to the corridor. They can be 
displayed as contours, used to create surface profiles, and perform every other 
function normally associated with surfaces.
Creating an Assembly
As mentioned previously, an assembly consists of smaller components called 
subassemblies. To create an assembly, you begin by creating an assembly base-
line, which is represented by a simple vertical line with a single base-point 
marker at its midpoint. Then you proceed by inserting individual subassemblies 
that represent elements such as lanes, curbs, ditches, and so on.
Before building an assembly, it’s a good idea to have at least a sketch of the 
typical cross section of your design so you have something to reference as you 
work. Having detailed dimensions is helpful but not critical—the subassemblies 
can be changed with relative ease, even after the corridor has been built.

What Are Subassemblies Made Of?
Subassemblies are made up of three fundamental components: points, links, and 
shapes. A point is self-explanatory, a link is a line that is drawn between two 
points, and a shape is the result of three or more links forming a closed shape, as 
shown in the following diagram. Each point, link, and shape in a subassembly has 
at least one code. These codes are used to identify the purpose of a component 
and control its style, behavior, and relationship to other parts of the design. A 
collection of styles that apply to multiple codes is called a code set style.

Creating a Corridor
Considering the complexity and sophistication of a corridor, the process of cre-
ating one is actually quite simple. Once the alignment, profile, and assembly 
are in place, it’s just a matter of telling these three objects that they belong 
together. Of course, the design is far from complete at this point, but as you’ll 
see in the next exercise, creating the initial version of a corridor involves only a 
few steps.

Applying Corridor Targets
One thing that makes corridors so powerful is their ability to interact with 
other objects in the drawing. Corridors are able to morph themselves into dif-
ferent shapes and sizes in order to respond to existing features or components 
of newly designed features. This is made possible through the use of special

subassemblies that can be stretched, twisted, and reconfigured as the design 
progresses along the corridor. What makes these subassemblies special is that 
they utilize corridor targets.
Three types of targets can be applied to a corridor: surface targets, width or 
offset targets, and slope or elevation targets.
Understanding Surface Targets
Surface targets are used in a number of cases where the corridor needs to inter-
act with a surface, such as when a slope is projected from a design elevation 
to the point where it intercepts an existing ground surface. This is referred to 
as daylighting. For example, in a section of road design that is above existing 
ground, daylighting can be used to create the embankment from the elevation 
of the road to the original ground elevation (see Figure 9.8).

on either side
Although daylighting is the most common example of surface targeting, there 
are other examples such as establishing the cross slope of an existing road, setting 
the top elevation of a retaining wall, setting the depth of a pipe, and many others.
Understanding Width or Offset Targets
Another type of target used in corridor design is referred to as a width or offset 
target. As the name suggests, this type of target is used to vary the width of an 
object or the distance between a point and the centerline (also known as offset). 
For example, an alignment can be used as a target that controls the outside 
edge of a lane. As the path of the alignment moves away from the road center-
line, the lane widens. As the path of the alignment moves toward the road cen-
terline, the lane narrows (see Figure 9.9).

F i g u r e   9 . 9    A width or offset target (in red) applied to a corridor to widen the lane and 
create a pull-off area
In addition to alignments, you can use feature lines, survey figures, and poly-
lines as width or offset targets. Lane widening is probably the most common 
use of a width or offset target, but there are many other uses. For example, you 
can use a width or offset target to control the location of a ditch, the width of a 
shoulder, or the distance between a shoulder and a guardrail.
Understanding Slope or Elevation Targets
Slope or elevation targets are used to control the elevations of one or more com-
ponents of a corridor. For example, these targets can control the elevations of a 
roadside ditch to ensure that it drains to a specific point, regardless of the slope 
of the adjacent road (see Figure 9.10). Profiles, feature lines, survey figures, and 
3D polylines can be used as this type of target.

Tying Proposed Elevations to Existing Elevations
The concept of daylighting is found throughout all types of land development. 
As I’ve mentioned, one of the fundamental activities of land development is 
changing the shape of the land. This means portions of the development will 
have new elevations that are above or below the existing elevations. Because 
things such as roads and parking lots aren’t much good underground and can’t 
simply float in midair, there must be some way of transitioning between new 
elevations and existing elevations. The most economical material that can be 
used to construct that transition is soil, but soil isn’t stable on steep slopes. 
Therefore, the transition between new and existing elevations is done with 
relatively mild slopes such as 3:1 (three units horizontal to one vertical). One of 
the most important components of your land-development design will be this 
tie-in between proposed elevations and existing elevations.

Enabling Target Behavior
Before you can use targets within your corridor, you must apply subassemblies 
that have targeting capabilities. Civil 3D comes with hundreds of subassemblies, 
each designed for a different purpose or application. Some of these subassem-
blies can use targets, and some can’t. For example, the BasicLane subassembly 
that you used earlier doesn’t have the ability to target anything. So if you would 
like to use a width or offset target to incorporate a turning lane, a pull-off 
area, or some other feature into your corridor, you’ll have to use a different 
subassembly.
Exercise 9.3: Apply Subassemblies That Can  
Use Targets
In this exercise, you’ll add subassemblies that will enable the corridor lane width 
to vary and the corridor to tie to an existing ground surface.

Assigning Targets
You use the Target Mapping dialog box to assign targets within a corridor. This 
dialog box lists the three types of targets (surfaces, width or offset targets, and 
slope or elevation targets) along with subassemblies within your corridor that 
are able to use each type of target (see Figure 9.14). Targets don’t have to be used 
whenever they are available. In fact, for many corridors, the majority of the tar-
gets are set to <None>.

Notice that you didn’t 
have to set the Side 
property to Left or 
Right. Civil 3D has a 
special feature that 
automatically guesses 
which side of the 
assembly you’re on.

Take the time to 
rename your subas-
semblies using logical, 
easy-to-remember 
names. This not only 
makes it easier to keep 
track of these things as 
you continue to work 
on your corridor, it also 
helps if you have to 
pass your work on to 
someone else.

In step 3, you’re prompted to select a region to edit. A region is essentially a part 
of your corridor that begins at one station and ends at another. All corridors start 
out with a single region that extends the full length of the corridor. As a design 
evolves, however, you’ll typically break up the corridor into multiple regions.

You should now see additional geometry along the edges of the 
corridor (see Figure 9.16). This represents the daylighting that has 
been applied. The daylighting geometry is noticeably wider in some 
areas than in others. These are areas that are below existing ground 
through which a ditch has been constructed. This automatic creation

Creating Corridor Surfaces
In Chapter 4, “Modeling the Existing Terrain Using Surfaces,” you learned 
about the benefits of using a surface to model the existing terrain. A surface 
provided a model of the land and enabled you to do things like display contours, 
label elevations, and create surface profiles. Imagine having all those capabili-
ties with a corridor as well. This is made possible through the creation of a cor-
ridor surface.

1 8 6  
C h ap t e r  9 • D e s i g n i n g i n  3 D U s i n g C o r r i d o r s
Cut and Fill
The terms cut and fill are used quite a bit in relation to land-development 
activities. For example, in the BasicSideSlopeCutDitch subassembly, the word 
cut refers to a condition where the road is below existing ground and therefore 
has to project a slope upward in order to daylight. Another way to envision this 
is that earth must be cut away in order to construct the road in these areas. The 
opposite of cut is fill, which refers to conditions where an area must be filled 
in with earth to create a design feature. Cut and fill can also be used to refer 
to quantities of earth, where cut represents the volume of earth that must be 
removed to build something and fill represents the volume of earth that must 
be brought in to build something.
Corridor surfaces are unique in that they exist as an integrated part of the 
corridor, although they show up in Prospector like any other Civil 3D surface. 
You use the Corridor Surface dialog box to create the initial corridor surface, 
and then you choose the data within the corridor that is to be added to this 
surface. You can choose links and feature lines based on the codes assigned to 
them. You can also click the Boundaries tab and add a boundary to the surface. 
Often, the simplest way to apply a boundary is to use the corridor extents as the 
outer boundary. You can also create boundaries automatically based on coded 
feature lines within a corridor, interactively by selecting individual feature lines 
within the corridor, or manually by selecting a polyline that already exists in the 
drawing.

codes aren’t particularly useful for creating surfaces, several are. The datum 
code, for example, is used to represent links that form the underside of the 
materials that make up the road. Why is this important? These links represent 
the trench, or roadbed, that must be excavated to accept road materials such as 
stone, concrete, and asphalt. The excavation of the roadbed often represents 
one of the most important aspects of constructing the project: earthmoving.
Intersections
One of the most sophisticated applications of targets and regions is the design 
of an intersection. Here you’ll find multiple baselines, regions, and targets that 
are necessary to tie two roads together as well as provide a smooth transition 
between them. For this reason, Civil 3D provides the Create Intersection com-
mand that automates the creation and management of these relationships.
After launching the Create Intersection command, you’re presented with the 
Intersection Wizard, which contains the following series of dialog boxes that 
request information about the design:
General    In this dialog, you specify general information about the intersection 
such as its name, description, and associated styles. Most important, you choose 
from one of two types of intersection designs: Primary Road Crown Maintained 
and All Crowns Maintained, as shown here.

Geometry Details    In this dialog, you choose a profile for each alignment, 
which will drive the centerline elevations of each road. You also define important 
horizontal geometry specifications by modifying the Curb Return Parameters 
and Offset Parameters settings. You provide vertical design specifications by 
addressing the Lane Slope Parameters and Curb Return Profile Parameters set-
tings. A portion of the Geometry Details dialog box is shown here.
Corridor Regions    In this dialog box, you specify the different assemblies 
that will be assigned to different portions of the intersection design. This group 
of assemblies and their assignments is called an assembly set. Assembly sets are 
typically set up by a CAD manager or lead CAD person and will most likely be 
provided for you, at least for your first few designs.

After you complete the Create Intersection command, your drawing contains 
a full, 3D representation of the intersection, as shown in the following image. 
The intersection design consists of new baselines, regions, and targets. As you 
make changes to your design, the relationships between the many intersection 
components will be honored, keeping the design in sync within itself as well as 
with adjacent portions of the corridor.
Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand the anatomy of a corridor and how 
alignments, profiles, and assemblies are combined to build a 3D corridor model. You can create 
an assembly representing a typical road cross section and then create a corridor using that 
assembly along with an alignment and a profile in the drawing. You can utilize target-capable 
subassemblies and configure the corridor to use the available targets to provide daylighting 
and changes in lane width. And finally, you’re able to create corridor surfaces so that important 
surface information can be used elsewhere in the design.
You’re now ready to begin creating and working with corridors in a production environment.

Chapter 10
Creating Cross 
Sections of the 
Design
One of the requirements for a successful and efficient design process is 
the ability to visualize the design in many different ways. So far, you have 
explored how profiles can give you more insight into your design by provid-
ing you with an alternate way to see and interact with it. In this chapter, 
you’ll examine the use of cross sections to visualize and display your design 
in yet another way: by slicing through it in a perpendicular direction.
In the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software, there are two primary approaches 
to viewing and documenting your design in cross-section view. For design 
purposes, you use a Civil 3D feature called the Section Editor that enables 
you to analyze and modify your design section by section. For documenta-
tion purposes, you use sample lines, sections, and section views. The sec-
tion view, just like the profile view, is the backdrop that houses the sections 
while providing a grid and annotations to go with them. There are also some 
things that sections can do that profiles can’t, such as slice through corri-
dors and create multiple section views at once.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Use the Section Editor
▶
▶Create sample lines
▶
▶Create section views
▶
▶Sample additional sources

Using the Section Editor
To understand what the Section Editor is and how it works, let’s review how a 
corridor is built. An alignment and a profile are combined to create a 3D chain, 
and then an assembly is repeatedly inserted along that 3D chain to create the 
full model. As you construct the assembly, you’re looking at a static version of 
the cross-sectional geometry of the road. This version doesn’t reflect the way in 
which the subassemblies interact with the targets you have assigned to them. 
However, the Section Editor enables you to view each assembly insertion in 
cross-section view, including any interactions involving targets. In addition, you 
can use the Section Editor to make edits to each corridor section and perfect 
your design down to the smallest detail.
When you click Section Editor on the ribbon, a Section Editor tab pro-
vides you with the tools you need to configure and navigate in the editor (see 
Figure 10.1). It can be very helpful to divide your drawing area into two or three 
viewports so you can see the section viewer alongside the “normal” view of your 
drawing. In fact, a great feature of the tool is that it displays a marker on the 
alignment and profile that indicates the location of the section you’re viewing. 
Thus, with three viewports available (plan, profile, and section), you can view 
your design from three different perspectives at once.
F i g u r e   1 0 . 1    The Section Editor ribbon tab
As the name implies, you can also use the Section Editor to edit your corridor 
design. This is done with the Parameter Editor command found on the Section 
Editor ribbon tab. This command shows all the subassemblies and their associ-
ated settings at a specific location on the corridor. These settings can be overrid-
den one corridor section at a time, or the overrides can be applied to a range of 
stations. The changes you make here are stored as overrides within the corridor.

What’s In a Name?
Think back to the previous chapter when you spent some time in Exercise 9.3 
renaming the individual subassemblies that made up the composition of the 
road. You should recognize the names Left Daylight and Right Daylight here 
in Exercise 10.1. This is an example of how spending a few extra seconds on 
bookkeeping helps things go much more smoothly when you’re further along 
in the design process. It’s an even bigger help when you’re working on a team; 
your teammates will thank you when your good bookkeeping makes their jobs 
easier and saves them time.
Creating Sample Lines
With a profile, the alignment serves as the path along which the profile is cut. 
For a cross section, the sample line assumes this role. When sample lines are 
created, they are associated with an alignment. Multiple sample lines are typi-
cally created simultaneously, so Civil 3D requires that sample lines be placed 
in a sample line group. An alignment can host multiple sample line groups 
if necessary. So the placement of sample lines in the alignment hierarchy is 
Alignment ➢ Sample Line Groups ➢ Sample Lines.
After launching the Sample Lines command on the ribbon, you’re prompted 
to select the parent alignment. Then you’re asked to name and stylize the sam-
ple lines and choose the sources that will be sampled to create cross sections. 
You can sample four types of objects: surfaces, corridors, corridor surfaces, and 
pipe networks. Finally, you’re presented with the Sample Line Tools toolbar, 
which contains an array of commands for creating and modifying the sample 
lines in a sample line group.

C h ap t e r 10  • Cr e a t i n g  Cr o s s  S e c t i o n s o f t h e  D e s i g n
On the Sample Line Tools toolbar, a pull-down menu provides several meth-
ods for placing sample lines along the alignment (see Figure 10.5). A description 
of each method is as follows:
F i g u r e   1 0 . 5    The Sample Line Tools toolbar showing the different methods available for 
sample line placement
By Range Of Stations    This method creates multiple sample lines with prede-
termined swath widths at a specified increment along the alignment. It’s great 
for creating large numbers of sample lines that are evenly distributed along the 
alignment. These sample lines are perpendicular to the alignment.
At A Station    This method is probably the simplest. You supply the station 
value, left swath width, and right swath width for each sample line you want to 
place. You can specify the station value graphically by clicking a point in the 
drawing or numerically by typing the value at the command line. This method 
is good if you only need to draw a few sample lines at odd locations. These sam-
ple lines are perpendicular to the alignment.
From Corridor Stations    This method creates a sample line wherever there is 
an assembly insertion on the corridor. This is a great solution when you would 
like to create and display cross sections for design purposes. Of course, one of 
the sources for your sample lines must be a corridor.
Pick Points On Screen    As the name suggests, with this method you click 
points on the screen, in effect drawing the sample line. This is ideal for irregu-
larly shaped sample lines that have multiple vertices and/or aren’t perpendicular 
to the alignment.
Select Existing Polylines    This method yields the same result as Pick Points 
On Screen, but you use it when you have already drawn a polyline representing 
the path of the sample line.

Swath width is the 
distance from the 
alignment to either the 
left or right end of the 
sample line.

Creating Section Views
Now that you have sample lines in the drawing that have captured section data 
from the sources you’ve chosen for them, you need a means by which to display 
that data in your drawing. Just as a profile needs a profile view to make it visible, 
a cross section needs a section view. Section views are similar to profile views. 
They usually display a grid and some grid labels as a backdrop to the data they 
house. The section view is dynamically linked to the sample line and associated 
data sources. This means, as with other Civil 3D objects, that if the sample or 
source data is modified, the section view will update automatically.

Style by Design
You may have noticed that many of the styles that were selected while creating 
this section view had the word design in their names. The significance of this 
is that the styles you chose were set up to aid the designer during the design 
process but may not be appropriate for final documents such as construction 
drawings. For example, the elevation and slope labels on the section would be 
much too small to read if this drawing were plotted. For design, however, they 
come in handy—enabling the designer to zoom in and quickly get information 
about key geometry. Leveraging styles by having some for design and others 
for documentation can be very useful.
Creating Multiple Section Views
For some projects, you may be required to provide documentation of cross sec-
tions at regular intervals along your design. This is especially common for road 
design projects, because a cross-section view is traditionally used to construct 
▶
This section view could 
be helpful in assess-
ing the design at a 
specific location. Note 
how the information 
is displayed in a way 
that aids in the design 
of the road. You could 
create additional sec-
tion views at other key 
locations along the 
design of the road.

the road. Although newer techniques and technologies have replaced the use of 
cross sections to some extent, the creation of cross-section sheets is still a com-
mon practice for these types of designs.
For most projects, there are too many section views to fit on a single sheet, so 
multiple sheets are required. This means the section views must be created in 
groups that each fit efficiently in the printable area of a typical sheet. This “per 
sheet” arrangement is handled through a group plot style.
Exercise 10.4: Create Multiple Section Views
In this exercise, you’ll use a new sample line group configured for section sheets 
to create multiple sheets containing section views.

Why More Sample Lines?
As you may recall, the first sample line group you created used the From Corridor 
Stations method to create the sample lines. This creates a sample line and the 
potential for a section view at each assembly insertion of the corridor. This con-
figuration is specifically for design purposes so the designer can see a section 
view at any key point in the design if desired. Now you need to create section 
views that meet the requirements for construction drawings. For this applica-
tion, you’re often required to show cross sections at regular intervals. Here, 
the intent is related not to the design process but to documentation. Because 
you can create multiple sample line groups for any given alignment, you could 
set up one sample line group for design purposes and one for documentation 
purposes. In fact, if you use Prospector to browse to the sample line groups of 
Jordan Court in this example, you’ll find that the Design sample line group still 
exists but that the styles have been set to hide the sample lines and their labels.

Sampling More Sources
So far, you have seen that corridors can be sampled and shown in a cross-sec-
tion view, but what about other sources of data? It turns out that sample lines 
can also slice through surfaces and pipe networks. In this section, you’ll learn

how to sample and display data from these sources. In addition, you’ll learn how 
to add more sources of data to an established set of sample lines and section 
views so you don’t have to start over when new data becomes available.
Exercise 10.5: Sample More Sources
In this exercise, you’ll add more data sources to your drawing, sample them, and 
show them in section views.

15.	 Use the LandXML command to import Subsurface Rock.xml. Use 
the Sample More Sources command to add the new surface named 
Rock to the section views. Set its style to Rock.

then click View Group Properties on the ribbon.
	
17.	 Click <Edit> in the Label Set column next to Rock. Select _No 
Labels, and click OK. Click OK again to return to the drawing.
	
18.	 Study the section views again. 
In a real-life situation, you may need to inform the engineer that 
the waterline design requires the excavation of a significant amount 
of rock. Also notice that around station 9+00 (0+270), the rock layer 
is very close to the surface—you may want to consider raising the 
road a bit in this area to avoid costly rock excavation.

The labels should be 
removed.

The scenario here may 
be that an engineer 
has asked you to check 
the waterline design

What Do You See?
As you pan from section view to section view, what story are you being told about 
the construction of this road? Which section views do you feel represent areas 
that require more time, effort, and money to build as opposed to others? In the 
first section views, you can see that the road cross section is much wider on the 
left side to account for the turning lane that you built into the corridor. As you 
progress further, you see sections that are very close to existing ground eleva-
tions, sections that are some distance above existing ground (a fill condition), 
and sections that are some distance below existing ground (a cut condition). 
How will the relationship of the road elevation to the existing ground elevation 
affect drainage for the homes that will be built along the road? Did you notice 
that ditches have been created in places where the road is in a cut condition? 
The amount of information and the number of additional questions generated 
by these simple pictures of the design are remarkable. The following images 
show some of the highlights of the design.
Station 1+50 (0+050) showing the widened left lane.
Station 4+50 (0+140), which is in an area that is very close to existing ground.
Station 13+50 (0+410) is in an area that is in cut. Note the ditches that are created.
Station 19+50 (0+600) is in an area that is in ﬁll. 
Note that no ditches are created in this condition.

Now You Know
Now that you’ve completed this chapter, you’re able to use the Section Editor to view and 
edit corridors in section views. You can create sample lines and choose the information that 
will be captured and presented in the section views. You know how to create section views, 
individually and in groups that are arranged in sheets. And finally, you can add more sources 
to section views in the drawing to show additional information that supplements the road.
Now that you’ve completed this chapter, you’re ready to begin working with sections and sec-
tion views in a production environment.

Chapter 11
Displaying and 
Annotating Sections
As you have learned, creating a design is only part of the story—you 
also have to display and annotate it in ways that effectively represent your 
design for its intended purpose. This also applies to sections. As you’ll see 
in this chapter, there are styles that control the appearance of the sections 
themselves as well as the section views that house them. There are labels 
that attach themselves to the sections and labels that can float in the section 
views. In fact, the methods you used to stylize and annotate sections and 
section views are very similar to those used for profiles and profile views.
Of course, there are also differences. For instance, you have to address the 
stylization and labeling of a corridor section, which you don’t need to do with 
profile views. Another difference is that section views typically are created in 
bulk, so their arrangement and grouping into sheets must also be managed.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

Applying Section Styles
Before I jump into section styles, I’ll discuss the difference between sections 
and corridor sections. Sections are derived from surfaces, and they can be 
thought of as a very close relative to surface profiles. Like surface profiles, they 
are typically represented by a single line and can be annotated using a label set. 
Corridor sections are something quite different. You can think of a corridor 
section as an assembly superimposed on a section view. It consists of subassem-
blies, points, links, and shapes. Because of the differences between sections and 
corridor sections, the methods you use to stylize and label them are different.
With that out of the way, let’s look at section styles. Section styles are used to 
change the appearance of a section either directly or by displaying it on a differ-
ent layer. The most common application of a section style is the differentiation 
between sections that represent existing and proposed ground surfaces. You can 
also use section styles to show point markers at each vertex in the section line.
Exercise 11.1: Apply Section Styles
In this exercise, you’ll apply section styles to differentiate between sections that 
represent finished ground, existing ground, and rock surfaces.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Section Styles.dwg located in 
the Chapter 11 class data folder. 
Here, you see three section views that were plotted to investigate 
the shallow rock layer. The section views show a corridor section, 
existing ground surface section, and rock section.
	 2.	 Click the lowest section in the 8+50.00 (0+260.00) section view, and 
then click Section Properties on the Section: Rock ribbon tab.
	
3.	 On the Information tab of the Section Properties dialog box, change 
Object Style to Rock. Click OK to close the dialog box. Press Esc to 
clear the selection. 
The rock section now appears as a gray dashed line.
	
4.	 Repeat the previous two steps for the section that appears above the 
rock layer, this time assigning a style of Existing Ground.
The section representing existing ground now appears as a red 
dashed line along with the rock section from the previous step (see 
Figure 11.1).

Applying Section Labels
At times, you may need to annotate sections with information about their eleva-
tions, slopes, offsets, and so on. As you learned in Chapter 8, “Displaying and 
Annotating Profiles,” label sets enable you to apply multiple labels at once as 
well as apply important configuration settings to the labels such as increment, 
weeding, and so on. For sections, the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software environment 
provides the following four types of labels that can be compiled into a label set:
Major Offset Labels    These labels are placed at constant increments along 
the section. You can use this label type to label offset, elevation, instantaneous 
grade, and many other properties.
Minor Offset Labels    These are the same as major offset labels except they are 
created at a smaller increment and must exist as children of the major offset labels.
Segment Labels    You use this label type to label the grade, length, and other 
properties of the line segments that make up the section.
Grade Break Labels    You use this label type to label the offset, elevation, and 
other properties of grade breaks—the locations where segments meet.
The first two types are created at increments, so they are spaced evenly across 
the section. The last two are created at individual components of the section, so 
they are placed wherever these components exist. Because sections sometimes 
have many short segments, you can configure the label sets to skip points that 
are close together to prevent labels from overlapping.
Exercise 11.2: Apply Section Labels
In this exercise, you’ll configure labels to show information on the elevations of 
the rock layer in each section view.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Section Labels.dwg located in 
the Chapter 11 class data folder. 
	 2.	 Click the rock section on the lowest section view, and then click Edit

Here you see the same 
three section views 
from the previous exer-
cise. The section view 
styles have been modi-
fied to create some 
extra space beneath 
the sections.

3.	 In the Section Labels – Rock dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Type, select Grade Breaks.
	
b.	 For Section Grade Break Label Style, select Rock.
	
c.	 Click Add.
	
d.	 For Dim Anchor Opt, select Graph View Bottom.
	
e.	 For Dim Anchor Val, enter 0.
	
f.	 Click OK.
You should see three labels along the bottom of the section view 
with lines extending upward from each one.
Anchors Aweigh
In step 3 of Exercise 11.2, you adjusted two settings relating to anchors. The 
concept of anchors is unique to certain types of labels that appear in section 
views and profile views. As a label style is composed, certain key points can be 
located at an anchor point whose location will be determined at the time the 
label is applied. This gives you some additional control over the placement of the 
labels. For example, in the previous steps, you specified that the labels should 
be aligned to the bottom of the grid by assigning Graph View Bottom as the Dim 
Anchor Opt setting. The Dim Anchor Val setting is an offset from the anchor point, 
which enables you to fine-tune the position of the label even more. An easy way 
to find out whether a label style that you have selected can respond to anchors is 
to look for a second grip. When initially created, this grip will be located where 
the anchor options specify. The grip can be moved to a location of your choice, 
providing even more flexibility with label placement.
	
4.	 Press Esc to clear the selection from the previous step. Click one of 
the labels, and then click Edit Label Group on the ribbon.
	
5.	 In the Weeding column, change the value to 5 (2). Click OK. Press 
Esc to clear the selection.

With the options you 
have selected, only 
three labels appear. 
It would be better to 
increase the number 
of labels to include 
more points along the 
section. In steps 4 and 
5, you’ll adjust the 
Weeding setting to 
provide more labels.

C h ap t e r 11  • D i s p l ay i n g  a n d A nn o t at i n g S e c t i o n s
As shown in Figure 11.2, more labels appear because the Weeding 
setting allows the space between the labels to be as small as 5 feet (2 
meters) rather than 100 feet (25 meters).
F i g u r e   1 1 . 2    A label set has been applied to the rock section to provide 
information about the elevations of the rock layer.
	
6.	 Apply the same labels to the rock section in the other two section 
views.
There Are Label Sets for Section Views Too
You learned about label sets in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 when dealing with align-
ment and profile labels. The same label set functionality is available for section 
views too. Try it for step 6 in Exercise 11.2. Instead of manually setting up the 
rock labels, use the Save Label Set function to save the first configuration, and 
then use Import Label Set to apply it to the other section views.

Controlling Corridor Section Display with 
Code Set Styles
You have already seen how section styles can be used to change the appearance 
of sections, but what about corridor sections? As stated earlier, the way this is 
handled is different and is done through the use of a code set style. The setup of 
code set styles is complicated, and it’s often left to the expertise of a CAD man-
ager or very experienced Civil 3D user. However, once code set styles are created 
and made available to you, the task of assigning them to a corridor section is 
fairly simple.
Code Set Styles
Let’s take a closer look at code set styles. First, it will be easier if you think of 
a corridor section as an assembly. You have already learned that assemblies 
are made up of smaller parts called subassemblies. You have also learned that 
subassemblies are made up of smaller parts called points, links, and shapes. 
Points, links, and shapes all have at least one code assigned to them, and this 
little string of text is the key to how code set styles work.
For example, one code that is used quite often is Pave. The BasicLaneTransition 
subassembly in your corridor uses a rectangular shape to represent the lane, 
and the Pave code is assigned to this shape as a property of the subassembly.
Shapes have styles just like all the other Civil 3D objects you have studied. For 
example, you can create a shape style called Hatched Pavement that displays 
the outline of the shape and fills it with a dot hatch to represent the pavement 
material. Another shape style might be Basic Pavement, which shows just an 
outline and no hatching.
Even for a simple assembly, the number of codes that are involved can grow quickly. 
And the number of styles can grow quickly as well—for example, you may want to 
apply a different style to each code to visually differentiate pavement from curbing 
from sidewalk, among other things. One job of a code set style is to match up multiple 
codes with multiple styles and store them all under one name. So, for example, you 
may have a code set style called Basic that uses the Basic Pavement style for any 
shape coded Pave. This might be only one of several or even dozens of match-ups 
between style and code in this code set style. Then, in another code set style named 
Detailed, you may decide to use the Hatched Pavement style for any instances of the 
Pave shape code. Again, this might be one of many code-style match-ups.

Now, with both code set styles in place, you can quickly change the appearance of 
your corridor section to take on either a Basic or Detailed appearance by simply 
switching the code set style, as shown in the following diagrams.

Applying Labels with Code Set Styles

exaggeration, and both can use bands to provide supplemental information 
along the bottom or the top of the view. In fact, the only significant difference 
between profile views and section views is that profile views display stations 
(read along the alignment) whereas section views display offsets (read perpen-
dicular to the alignment).
Exercise 11.5: Apply Section View Styles
In this exercise, you’ll experiment with changing the section view style for an 
individual section view as well as for a group of section views.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Section View Styles.dwg 
located in the Chapter 11 class data folder. 
	 2.	 Click the lowest section view, and then click Section View Properties 
on the ribbon.
	
3.	 On the Information tab of the Section View Properties dialog box, 
change the style to Design 10V Major And Minor – No Padding. Click 
OK. Press Esc to clear the selection.
All That with One Style?
In step 3 of Exercise 11.5, when you changed the section view style from Design 
5V Major And Minor to Design 10V Major And Minor – No Padding, the following 
changes were made to the section view:
▶
▶The vertical exaggeration changed from 5 to 10, causing the elevation 
changes in the sections to be much more dramatic.
▶
▶The elevation grid interval changed to increase the frequency of both the 
major grids and minor grids along with their associated labels.
▶
▶The space beneath the sections (padding) was removed.
▶
▶The minor interval of the offset grid lines was increased.
This is a classic example of the power of styles. To make these changes manually 
would have taken several minutes to figure out—even for an experienced user. 
Instead, all you have to do is assign a different style, and all the changes are 
applied instantaneously.

This view is similar to the previous one, but this time there is no 
vertical exaggeration.
	
5.	 Use the Section View Properties command to change the style to 
Design 1V – No Grid. 
Because this section view style excludes the grid and labels, you 
might use it to create illustrations for a report.

Design 5V Major Only. 
This view is similar to the other views immediately above it, except 
the minor grids aren’t displayed.

select View Group Properties on the ribbon. 
This opens the Section View Group Properties dialog box.
	
8.	 On the Section Views tab, click in the Style column in the first row 
across from Section View Group – 1.
The new section view style applies a vertical exaggeration of 2, so 
the section views take up more space top to bottom. In the next step, 
you’ll rearrange the views on the sheet so they’re easier to read.

Applying Section View Bands
You may need to display additional information about the sections to accom-
pany what is conveyed by the section view. Bands can be a useful tool for this 
purpose, enabling you to display information both graphically and textually. 
There are two types of section view bands, as described here:
Section Data Bands    You use this type of band for labeling offset and eleva-
tion data at regular increments along the section view.
Section Segment Bands    You use this type of band to label length and slope 
information about individual segments. Because the individual labels are cre-
ated segment by segment, they aren’t evenly spaced across the band as you see 
in a section data band. Weeding can be applied to improve situations where seg-
ments are short and labels overlap.
Exercise 11.6: Apply Section View Bands
In this exercise, you’ll apply section view bands to an individual section to dis-
play information for stations, elevations, and rock depth. You’ll then apply bands 
to a group of section views and update the layout of the section views to account 
for the additional space taken up by the bands.

Applying Group Plot Styles
Throughout this chapter, you have been working with several sheets’ worth of 
section views all neatly arranged within predefined sheet borders. You may be 
wondering what controls this behavior, and if you guessed that it’s some sort of 
style, you’re correct. The arrangement of multiple section views is accomplished 
by a group plot style.
A group plot style uses an assortment of settings to configure the layout of 
multiple section views. When section view groups are created, there are two 
placement options: Production and Draft. When a section view group is created 
using the Production placement option, the layout of section views is made to 
fit on individual sheets. The size and shape of the individual sheets come from a 
template (.dwt) file. When the Draft placement option is used, the section views 
are laid out as a single group and aren’t bound within a given area.
Another function of group plot styles is to overlay a grid on the sections. With 
this approach to sheet creation, the section views don’t typically have their own 
grid but are superimposed on a grid that covers the entire sheet.

Creating Section View Labels
So far in this chapter, you have seen how to create many different types of anno-
tations. There are label sets that are applied to sections, labels applied to cor-
ridor sections through code set styles, labels applied to section views and bands, 
and even labels attached to objects that have been projected to section views. 
One limitation of these labels is that they’re all connected to something and 
therefore get their information and location from another object. What if you 
need to create a basic, all-purpose label that can be used to convey offset and 
elevation on a section view? To do this, you create a section view label.
Section view labels are attached to the section view itself. They can be placed 
anywhere in the section view and used to label just about anything.

Exercise 11.8: Create Section View Labels
In this exercise, you’ll create a section view label that calls out the location of 
the curb flowline in a section view.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Section View Labels.dwg 
located in the Chapter 11 class data folder. 
The drawing is zoomed in to the first section view on Jordan Court 
where the road is widened to accommodate a turn lane. The scenario 
for this exercise is that you have been asked to include offset and ele-
vation information for the curb flowline so that the contractor knows 
exactly where to place the curb in the widened area.
	
2.	 On the Annotate tab of the ribbon, click Add Labels. In the Add 
Labels dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Feature, select Section View.
	
b.	 For Label Type, select Offset Elevation.
	
c.	 For Offset Elevation Label Style, verify that Offset Over 
Elevation is selected.
	
d.	 For Marker Style, verify that Basic is selected.
	
e.	 Click Add.
	
3.	 Click one of the grid lines of the section view. Right-click while hold-
ing down the Shift key, and then select Endpoint. Click the flowline 
of the left curb.
	
4.	 Press Esc to clear the current command. Click the newly created 
label, and drag its square grip up and to the left to improve its 
readability.
	
5.	 Click the label, and then click Edit Label Text on the ribbon. This 
opens the Text Component Editor dialog box.
	
6.	 In the window on the right, click just to the left of the word Offset to 
place your cursor in the position before it. Type CURB FLOWLINE, 
and press Enter. 
The result should look like Figure 11.11.

Be Careful
Although the label in Exercise 11.8 is pointing to the curb, it isn’t attached to it. 
If a change in the design causes the curb to move, the label might not be point-
ing to the right spot and will need to be updated manually. This isn’t a difficult 
thing to do, but it’s something that could easily be overlooked. A more permanent 
solution would be to incorporate the label into a code set style.
Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you’re able to apply section styles, code set styles, 
and section view styles to change the appearance of cross sections for your designs. You’re 
also able to add labels through code set styles, section labels, and section view labels. You can 
display additional information in your section views using bands. Finally, you know how to use 
group plot styles to configure an array of section views that are formatted to fit on various 
sheets for easy documentation.
You’re now ready to begin displaying and annotating sections and section views in a produc-
tion environment.

Chapter 12
Designing and 
Analyzing Boundaries 
Using Parcels
In the previous chapter, you completed the road-design portion of the 
example project by creating and displaying cross sections. With the roads 
in place, it’s now time to look at another aspect of the design: the layout of 
real-estate lots. Although the road design and lot layout are very different 
types of designs, they are still dependent on one another because the roads 
determine the front boundaries of the lots. In the example project, you won’t 
return to road design, but in a real project, there are often adjustments to 
the road layout that can affect the lots as well as other design aspects.
As the designer in this project, you’ll be asked to design the layout of the 
single-family lots as well as open space areas, community areas, utility ease-
ments, and so on. The developer makes money by selling the lots, so the more 
lots there are to sell, the more profit there is to be had. So why not make a 
thousand tiny little lots? Well, of course, if a lot is too small to fit a house, 
it will be nearly useless and won’t sell. In addition, other aspects determine 
minimum size requirements for lots, such as the market the developer is tar-
geting and/or zoning laws. Your job as the designer will be to create as many 
lots as possible while meeting these minimum size requirements.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

Understanding Parcels
Quite often, a land-development project involves the purchase, consolidation, 
or subdivision of a piece of real estate. Even if this isn’t the case, the boundary 
of the developed property must be accurately depicted in the design drawings. 
It must also be marked in the field to ensure that neighboring properties aren’t 
encroached on. Yet another potential aspect of a land-development project is accu-
rately determining the location of rights-of-way and easements, whether existing 
or proposed. Through parcel objects and their associated commands and annota-
tions, the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software environment provides you with tools for 
creating, analyzing, and displaying legal boundaries efficiently and accurately.
Understanding Parcel Objects
As you have seen with other Civil 3D features, Civil 3D makes use of specialized 
objects to perform specific tasks. Creating parcels is no different. It involves the 
use of specialized objects whose behavior makes the process of creating and modi-
fying parcels as efficient as possible. The objects that are applied in this case are 
called parcel segments. You can think of parcel segments as lines and curves that 
have been identified as sides of a parcel. They can be drawn from scratch using 
a special toolbar, or they can be created by converting lines, arcs, and polylines. 
Parcel segments must be assigned to a site so Civil 3D understands that they 
should react to one another. When parcel segments in the same site form a closed 
shape, that shape becomes a parcel object. This is a unique arrangement because 
you can’t directly create a parcel object; instead, you create other objects to form a 
closed area, and then Civil 3D creates the parcel object for you (see Figure 12.1).
F i g u r e   1 2 . 1    The four parcel segments on the left don’t form a closed shape; therefore, no 
parcel is created. On the right, a parcel object is created automatically, as shown by the black outline 
and the LOT 1 label.

 
Un d e r s t a n d i n g P arc e l s	
2 3 1
In the same manner, any modifications to the fundamental objects that make 
up a parcel will result in an automatic update to the parcel itself. This is most 
evident when parcels are labeled with area, bearing, and distance information.
Understanding Sites
Placing objects within the same site is how you tell Civil 3D that you want these 
objects to “see” each other and interact. You can also prevent objects from inter-
acting by placing them in different sites. The sites are listed in Prospector, and 
you can create as many as you need in a given drawing (see Figure 12.2).
F i g u r e   1 2 . 2    Sites listed in Prospector, with the contents of one site expanded 
When parcel segments are placed in the same site in such a way that they cre-
ate one or more closed shapes, the closed shapes automatically become parcels. 
Alignments, feature lines, grading groups, and survey figures can also occupy 
sites. These objects are able to interact with parcels and with one another. For 
example, if an alignment crosses through a parcel, the alignment automatically 
subdivides the parcel to create two parcels. For this to take place, the parcel and 
the alignment must be in the same site. By the same token, you can prevent the 
alignment from subdividing the parcel by placing the alignment and parcel in 
separate sites. In the left image of Figure 12.3, the alignment and parcel are in 
different sites and therefore don’t interact to create two parcels from one. In the 
right image of Figure 12.3, the alignment has been moved to the same site as 
the parcel, causing it to be subdivided automatically.

Creating Parcels from Objects
One way you can create parcels is to select lines, arcs, and polylines that already 
exist in your drawing and convert them into parcel segments. This technique 
is often used when the parcel geometry is especially complex or must be drawn 
based on other geometry in the drawing. Civil 3D provides a few tools for draw-
ing parcel segments directly, but many more drawing and editing commands 
are available in the AutoCAD part of Civil 3D. For this reason, you may find it 
easier to create the necessary geometry using the AutoCAD drafting commands 
rather than the Civil 3D commands.
Converting basic AutoCAD entities to parcel segments is relatively simple. 
You launch the command from the ribbon; select the lines, arcs, and/or circles 
that you would like to convert; and then provide some information about the 
parcel segments you’re about to create. If the selected objects intersect to create 
closed shapes, Civil 3D takes care of the rest. You’ll know the parcels have been 
created when the labels appear in the drawing area and the parcels are listed in 
Prospector.
Exercise 12.1: Create Parcels from Objects
In this exercise, you’ll create parcels from geometry provided for you. You will 
first create the overall project parcel, then the right-of-way parcel, and finally, 
large parcel areas that will be subdivided into individual lots at a later time.

Creating Parcels by Layout
Earlier in this chapter, you read about the advantage of using basic AutoCAD 
drafting commands to produce parcel geometry. As mentioned, these commands 
are great for drawing lines and curves based on general geometric principles. But 
what if you need to create parcels that occupy a certain area, parcel segments 
that are perpendicular to a road frontage, or parcels that meet a minimum depth 
requirement based on zoning laws? These are all criteria that are specific to 
property boundaries, and they are all built into the Civil 3D Parcel Layout Tools 
toolbar. When you launch the parcel layout tools from the ribbon, they appear on 
a specialized toolbar similar to what you have seen for alignments and profiles. 
Parcel Terminology
Certain terms are unique to property boundary design. Here are a few that you’ll 
want to become familiar with:
Parcel or Lot    This is a piece of land delineated by a legal boundary.
Bearing    This is a horizontal direction expressed in degrees east or west of a 
north or south direction. For example, N 25° E means to face north and then rotate 
to the right 25°. Bearings are often combined with distances to mathematically 
define a parcel line.
Right-of-way    This is a strip of land used for transportation purposes. It’s 
commonly expressed as a constant width on either side of a road centerline.
Frontage    For lots along a road, this is the length of the front line that is coin-
cident with the edge of the right-of-way. Increased frontage typically increases 
the value of a piece of land.
Setback    This is the required distance between a property line and a building. 
Often the front, rear, and side setbacks are expressed separately.
Easement    This is a strip of land that someone is given the right to use for a 
certain purpose, but not to own. For example, a utility easement might give a 
utility company the right to install and maintain a utility line within a certain 
area of a person’s property. 
Zoning    Zoning is a way of dividing large areas of land into zones and dictat-
ing different land-use requirements for each zone. For example, in one zone, 
the minimum lot size might be 5 acres (2 hectares), whereas in another, it might 
be 0.25 acres (0.10 hectares). Zoning boundaries and regulations are typically 
determined by a local government entity.

Using the Parcel Sizing Tools
The next set of tools on the Parcel Layout Tools toolbar that you’ll learn about 
is by far the most powerful: the parcel sizing tools. These tools enable you to lay 
out multiple lots within a predetermined area, with each lot meeting the size 
parameters you specify. These tools will create the bulk of the lots in a residen-
tial land-development design such as the example project you’re working on.
You can use the following three tools to create new lots based on size:
Slide Line – Create    This tool creates one or more lots by sliding a line along 
the frontage until all size and dimension requirements are met.
Swing Line – Create    This tool creates one or more lots by rotating a line 
around a fixed swing point and intersecting it with a lot line across from the swing 
point. The result is one or more lots that radiate outward from the swing point.
Free Form Create    This tool creates a lot by attaching one end of a line to a 
parcel segment and extending that line along a specified angle (usually perpen-
dicular) until it intersects another parcel segment.
Exercise 12.3: Create Parcels Using the Parcel 
Sizing Tools
In this exercise, you’ll create several new parcels using the parcel sizing tools on 
the Parcel Layout Tools toolbar.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Using the Parcel Sizing Tools.dwg 
located in the Chapter 12 class data folder.
	
2.	 On the Home tab of the ribbon, click Parcel ➢ Parcel Creation Tools.
	
3.	 On the Parcel Layout Tools toolbar, expand the button containing the 
parcel sizing tools, and click Slide Line – Create.
	
4.	 Click OK to dismiss the Create Parcels – Layout dialog box. When 
you’re prompted to select a parcel, click the label that reads Property : 
25 at the southwest end of the project.
	
5.	 When you’re prompted to select the first point on the frontage, click 
the western endpoint of the lot line you previously created at station 
4+20.38 (0+128.13), as shown in Figure 12.9.

Using Parcel Sizing and Layout Parameters
The Parcel Layout Tools toolbar includes commands for creating new parcel 
geometry as well as editing it. The toolbar expands downward to reveal parame-
ters that determine the dimensions of the lots that are created. This enables you 
to include size requirements in your parcel design that may have been requested 
by the developer or dictated by zoning laws.
The layout parameters available to you are listed here. The image next to each 
parameter matches the schematic preview shown in the bottom of the Parcel 
Layout Tools toolbar as you click each parameter:
Minimum Area    This is the minimum area occupied by the lot. Minimum 
area is a common requirement that designers must meet to satisfy zoning 
requirements.
▶
You can type a number 
followed by the unit 
(without a space), and 
that number will be 
converted to the cur-
rent units.
▶
To use a Midpoint 
object snap, hold down 
your Shift key and 
right-click; then select 
Midpoint. A new parcel 
line and a new parcel 
are created.

	
Cr e at i n g P arc e l s by L ay o u t 	
2 4 3
Minimum Frontage    This is the minimum length of the lines or arcs that 
make up the side of the lot that is coincident with a road right-of-way. This 
is also a common parameter that designers must meet to satisfy zoning 
requirements.
Use Minimum Frontage At Offset    Some zoning regulations allow the front-
age to be measured at the building setback line rather than at the frontage line 
itself. This would enable you to create a larger number of smaller lots, especially 
when creating lots along the outside of a curve.
Frontage Offset    This parameter is typically used to define the building  
setback line.
Minimum Width    This is the minimum width allowed for the  
resulting parcel.
Minimum Depth    This is the minimum depth allowed for the parcel,  
measured perpendicular to the frontage at its midpoint.
Use Maximum Depth    This parameter prevents the development of exceed-
ingly deep lots, potentially enabling the area to be subdivided more efficiently.
Maximum Depth    This is the maximum depth allowed for the parcel,  
measured perpendicular to the frontage at its midpoint.
Multiple Solution Preference – Use Shortest Frontage    When multiple 
solutions are possible, the one that produces the shortest frontage is selected.
Multiple Solution Preference – Use Smallest Area    When multiple solu-
tions are possible, the one that produces the smallest area is selected.

C h ap t e r 12  • D e s i g n i n g  a n d A n a l y z i n g B o u n d ar i e s U s i n g P arc e l s
In addition to the parcel-sizing parameters, there are parcel-layout parameters 
that affect the creation of multiple parcels. The first is Automatic Mode, which 
determines whether parcels are created individually or all at once, as follows:
Automatic Mode – On    Multiple parcels are created within the selected area 
based on the parameters that have been specified.
Automatic Mode – Off    Parcels are created one at a time, and you’re 
prompted for information for each parcel.
The second parcel-layout parameter is Remainder Distribution, which 
determines what is done with the “leftover” area after all parcels that meet 
the size requirements have been created. The Remainder Distribution options 
are as follows:
Create Parcel From Remainder    A new parcel is created that is smaller than 
the specified sizing parameters.
Place Remainder In Last Parcel    The last parcel is oversized by adding the 
remainder to it.
Redistribute Remainder    All parcels are oversized by a small amount so that 
the leftover area is spread across all parcels.
Exercise 12.4: Create Multiple Parcels
In this exercise, you’ll create multiple parcels by using the Slide Line Create 
command with Automatic Mode turned on.

Editing Parcels
As you have seen with other design elements, the ability to edit parcels is even 
more important than their initial layout. Civil 3D provides you with three fun-
damental tools to edit your parcel geometry: grips, Edit Geometry commands, 
and Parcel Layout Tools.
Editing Parcels Using Grips
Graphically editing parcels is fairly simple when compared to editing alignments 
or profiles. There are only two types of grips to learn: the square grip and the 
diamond-shaped grip. The square grip is simply the standard grip that allows 
movement in any direction with no restriction. The diamond-shaped grip is 
displayed on parcel lines that have been created using the Parcel Layout Tools. 
These grips slide one parcel line along another parcel line or curve while main-
taining the angle (usually perpendicular) between the two lines.
Exercise 12.5: Edit Parcels with Grips
In this exercise, you’ll experiment with grip-editing parcel lines and observing 
their behavior.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Parcels Using Grips.dwg 
located in the Chapter 12 class data folder.

the screen, and notice the behavior of this grip. 
	
4.	 Hold down the Shift key, and right-click to reveal the object snap 
context menu. Select Nearest.
	
5.	 Pick a point somewhere along the property line that forms the east-
ern side of the lot. 
	
6.	 Press Esc to clear your selection. Click the line that forms the south-
ern boundary of this parcel. 
Notice that a single diamond-shaped grip appears.
	
7.	 Click the diamond-shaped grip, and slide it along the parcel line it’s 
attached to. Slide it north to the curved areas, and notice how it stays 
perpendicular to the parcel segments it’s attached to (see Figure 12.15).
F i g u r e   1 2 . 1 5    As it’s moved with the diamond-shaped grip, the parcel line 
stays perpendicular to the parcel segments it’s associated with.

Editing Parcels Using the Edit Geometry 
Commands
When you need to modify the parcel lines and curves themselves, you can use 
the commands found on the Edit Geometry panel of the Parcel ribbon tab. The 
commands included on this panel are as follows:
Insert PI    Inserts an angle point into a parcel line segment.
Delete PI    Removes an angle point from a parcel line segment.
Break    Creates a gap in a parcel segment.
Trim    Shortens a parcel segment using some other entity as a  
cutting edge.
Join    Joins two parcel segments together.
Reverse Direction    Changes the direction of the parcel segment.
Edit Curve    Allows you to change the radius of a parcel curve segment.
Fillet    Replaces an angle point with a parcel curve segment that is tangent  
at either end.
Fit Curve    Replaces a series of parcel line segments with a parcel curve 
segment.
Stepped Offset    Similar to the AutoCAD offset command, except that it 
prompts you for an elevation; the resulting entity is a polyline, not a parcel 
segment.
Exercise 12.6: Edit Parcels with the Edit 
Geometry Commands
In this exercise, you’ll improve the geometry of several parcels using the Edit 
Geometry commands on the ribbon.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Parcels Using Edit Commands

You may have noticed that the dialog box that appears when you’re editing the 
curve refers to the entity as a feature line. Parcel segments are close relatives of 
feature lines, and many of the feature-line commands can be used on them. In 
fact, all the Edit Geometry commands in this section work for feature lines too.

of the Parcel ribbon tab includes, such as Insert PI and Delete PI. You’ll also find 
editing versions of the parcel-sizing commands that you used earlier to create 
parcels. The Slide Line – Edit and Swing Line – Edit commands work much like 
their Create counterparts, but instead of creating new parcel lines, they slide or 
rotate existing parcel lines to meet new size requirements. In addition, you can 
create a parcel union that combines multiple parcels into a single identity. There 
is also a command that will dissolve this union, returning the component par-
cels to their individual status.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you’re able to create parcels by converting objects in 
the drawing and by drawing your own parcel geometry from scratch. You can create parcels that 
automatically meet area, frontage, and other requirements, and you can do this for individual 
parcels or large numbers of them. You can edit parcels using grips, commands on the ribbon, 
and commands on the Parcel Layout Tools toolbar.
You’re ready to begin creating and modifying parcels in a production environment.

Chapter 13
Displaying and 
Annotating Parcels
In the previous chapter, you used AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software to design 
a layout for subdividing the original project parcel into many smaller parcels. 
The reason for this was to create pieces of land that were the right size and 
shape for selling to prospective homeowners. However, before any sales can 
take place, that subdivision plan typically has to be reviewed and approved 
by an agency that oversees planning for that region. In many places, it must 
also be presented as an official legal document to be recorded at the local 
courthouse. Because of the need to create documentation of your layout, 
you must now address the appearance of the layout as well as the annota-
tion needed to convey important information about it. In this chapter, you’ll 
study the use of parcel styles, parcel labels, and tables to effectively display 
and annotate your parcel layout.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Apply parcel styles
▶
▶Apply parcel area labels
▶
▶Create parcel segment labels
▶
▶Edit parcel segment labels
▶
▶Create parcel tables

C h ap t e r 13  • D i s p l ay i n g  a n d A nn o t at i n g P arc e l s
Applying Parcel Styles
Parcels can represent individually owned lots, public areas, road rights-of-way, 
easements, and so on. When different types of parcels are shown on the same plan, 
there must be some way of visually differentiating them. When using Civil 3D, this 
is best handled through parcel styles.
Using Parcel Styles to Control Appearance
Using a parcel style, you can control the appearance of the edges of a parcel as 
well as any hatching that is applied to the area. The hatching can be applied 
through the entire area or as a strip along the edges. Using these capabilities, 
you can graphically differentiate one type of parcel from another.
Exercise 13.1: Apply Parcel Styles
In this exercise, you’ll apply different styles to differentiate types of legal parcels. 
These include adjoiner parcels, rights-of-way, individual lots, open space lots, 
and easements.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Parcel Styles.dwg located in 
the Chapter 13 class data folder. 
The drawing contains a complete parcel layout, and all the parcels 
have been assigned a style of Standard.
	 2.	 Click the Standard : 3 label located near the center of the area con-
taining the farm buildings. On the ribbon, click Parcel Properties.
	
3.	 On the Information tab of the Parcel Properties dialog box, change 
Object Style to Adjoiner. Click OK. 
The linetype of the parcel segments changes to a double-dashed 
pattern. Also, the label changes and now reads Adjoiner : 3.
	
4.	 Press Esc to clear the previous selection. Click the Standard : 6 label 
located in the cul-de-sac of Madison Lane. Right-click, and select 
Properties.
If you haven’t already 
done so, download 
and install the files for 
Chapter 13 according to 
the instructions in this 
book’s Introduction. 
Because working 
with parcels is done 
in 2D, the drawings 
in this chapter aren’t 
set up with multiple 
viewports as in other 
chapters.
▶
One way to select a 
parcel is to click its 
label. You can’t select 
a parcel by clicking one 
of its segments.
▶
▶
This parcel is renamed 
automatically because 
of a setting in the style 
that combines its style 
name with a number.

5.	 Using the Properties window, change Style to ROW. Press Esc to clear 
your selection.
The right-of-way area is now outlined by a dashed line and has 
been hatched with a dot pattern.
	
6.	 Use either the Parcel Properties command or the Properties window 
to change the large parcels at the northeast and southeast corners of 
the site (Standard : 7 and Standard : 4) to a style of Open Space. 
These parcels are now outlined in green and hatched with a green 
crossing pattern.
	
7.	 Zoom in to the 90° bend on Jordan Court, and note the narrow 
Standard : 1 parcel located there. 
	
8.	 Change the style of the Standard : 1 parcel to Easement. 
The area is hatched with a diagonal stripe pattern.
	
9.	 Click one of the remaining parcels that is still labeled Standard, and 
change its style to Lot. 
	
10.	 Go to Prospector, and expand Sites ➢ Lot Layout. Click Parcels to 
display all the parcels in the item view at the bottom of Prospector.
	
11.	 In the bottom section of Prospector, scroll to the right until you can 
see the Style column. Click the Style column heading to sort the par-
cels by style.
	
12.	 Click the first parcel with a style of Standard. Then press and hold 
the Shift key, scroll down, and select the last parcel with a style of 
Standard. 
	
13.	 Right-click the Style column heading, and select Edit. In the Select 
Style dialog box, select Lot and click OK.
Now, all the parcels you selected in Prospector have been assigned 
the Lot style (see Figure 13.1).
Using the Properties 
window is faster 
because you can 
change both parcels 
at once.

Applying Parcel Style Display Order
It’s quite common for adjacent parcels to share one or more segments. If the 
adjacent parcels have different styles assigned to them, you can control which 
style is used for the shared segments via the Site Parcel Properties dialog box. 
To access this dialog box, right-click Parcels in Prospector and select Properties. 
The Parcel Style Display Order list is displayed on the Composition tab, as shown 
in Figure 13.2. When two different styles are used for adjacent parcels, the style 
that is higher in this list is assigned to the shared segments. You can control the 
result for the shared segments by using the arrow keys or by dragging and drop-
ping the style names to change the order of the list.

F i g u r e   1 3 . 2    Parcel Style Display Order shown in the Site Parcel Properties dialog box
Typically you’ll want certain types of parcel line styles to always override others. 
For example, right-of-way lines are considered one of the most important bound-
aries in the drawing, so their style is often placed at the top of the list. As a result, 
the color and linetype of the right-of-way lines are uninterrupted throughout the 
drawing. On the other hand, the lot lines are considered one of the least impor-
tant, so their styles are typically placed at the bottom of the list.
Exercise 13.2: Control Parcel Style Display Order
In this exercise, you’ll apply the Parcel Style Display Order function to control 
the display behavior when parcels of different styles share common segments.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Parcel Style Display Order.dwg 
located in the Chapter 13 class data folder. 
	
2.	 In Prospector, expand Sites ➢ Lot Layout.
	
3.	 Right-click Parcels, and select Properties.
	
4.	 On the Composition tab of the Site Parcel Properties dialog box, click 
ROW under Parcel Style Display Order.
	
5.	 Click the upward-pointing arrow icon multiple times until ROW is at 
the top of the list. Click OK.
Lot : 23 is now bounded by a purple dashed line on the south and 
east sides and a blue dashed line on the north and west sides. The 
ROW parcel style is being displayed “on top of” the Lot style, as dic-
tated by Parcel Style Display Order (see Figure 13.3).

Applying Parcel Area Labels
The labels you have seen at the center of each parcel are known as parcel area 
labels. They don’t have to contain information about the area of the parcel; 
however, they often do. You can create parcel area labels by using the Add 
Labels command as you have done before to create other labels. One unique

capability of parcel area labels is that they can also be assigned through the 
Parcel Properties command. As with all other labels you have learned about, the 
appearance and content of parcel area labels are controlled by styles.
Exercise 13.3: Apply Parcel Area Labels
In this exercise, you’ll apply parcel area label styles in a number of ways. For 
adjoiner parcels, you’ll use them to display ownership information. For the ROW 
parcel, you’ll remove the area label because it isn’t needed. Finally, for individual 
lots, you’ll apply a style that shows only the lot number.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Parcel Area Labels.dwg 
located in the Chapter 13 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Adjoiner : 3 label, and then click Parcel Properties on the 
ribbon.
	
3.	 Click the Composition tab of the Parcel Properties dialog box. For 
Area Selection Label Style, select Existing Description And Area.
	
4.	 Click the Information tab. In the Description box, enter JOHN

This is a possible format for labeling a parcel that isn’t part of the 
main project but is adjacent or nearby. It includes the owner’s name 
plus the deed book and page where the official documentation of the 
parcel is recorded. Notice how this label style combines the hand-
entered Description value along with the calculated area value.

Creating Parcel Segment Labels
The most common use of parcel segment labels is to provide numerical infor-
mation that defines the geometry of property boundaries. This numerical 
information appears as bearings and distances for line segments and curve data 
for curve segments. When an adequate numerical description of a parcel is pro-
vided, the parcel can be re-created either on paper or in the field.
To add labels to parcel segments, you use the Add Labels command. You can 
label the segments one by one, or you can provide labels for all the segments 
that make up a parcel.
Exercise 13.4: Label Parcel Segments
In this exercise, you’ll use parcel segment labels to provide bearings, distances, 
and curve data in your drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Parcel Segment Labels.dwg 
located in the Chapter 13 class data folder.
	
2.	 Zoom in to lots 32 and 33 near the center of the project.

4.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, select Parcel as the feature. Click Add.
	
5.	 Click the north side of lot 33. 
A new bearing and distance label is added.
	
6.	 Click the east and west sides of lot 33. 
Two more bearing and distance labels are created. The labels will 
be created at the location you click, so you should click near the mid-
point of the line.

boundary of the lot. 
A curve label is created that displays the delta, length, and radius.

type, and then click Add.
Labeling Lines and Curves
Thus far in this chapter, you’ve learned how to label parcel segments, but what 
about plain old lines, arcs, and polylines? Do these entities have to be converted 
to parcel segments in order to be labeled? The answer is no. Civil 3D enables you 
to label basic AutoCAD entities using the same Add Labels command you used 
for labeling parcel segments. Just remember that you need to choose Line And 
Curve as the feature in the Add Labels dialog box, as shown here.
	
9.	 Click the parcel area label for lot 32. When you’re prompted to select 
a direction, press Enter to accept the default direction of clockwise. 
All segments for lot 32 are labeled simultaneously.

Curve Data
Many geometric properties can be used to define a curve. The most common 
properties are shown in the following drawing and then described:
▶
▶Length: The length of the curve, measured along its arc.
▶
▶Radius: The distance from the center point of the curve to a point on  
the curve.
▶
▶Chord: The straight line from the beginning point of the curve to the ending 
point of the curve. The bearing and distance of this line can be labeled.
▶
▶Delta: The change in direction between a line tangent to the curve at 
its beginning point and a line tangent to the curve at its ending point.
▶
▶Tangent: The distance between the point of curvature (PC) and the point 
of intersection (PI) or between the point of tangency (PT) and the PI.
Depending on the requirements, you may need to include different combinations 
of these curve dimensions. Typically, you must create multiple curve-dimension 
labels in order to provide enough information to reconstruct a curve.

Editing Parcel Segment Labels
Once you have placed parcel segment labels in the drawing, you usually need 
to do some work to change their position, style, orientation, and whatever 
else is necessary to create a readable, professional-looking legal document. 
Fortunately, Civil 3D provides a number of ways for you to do this.
Applying Segment Label Styles
You can use parcel segment label styles to change the appearance, content, and 
behavior of the segment labels. For example, when labeling an existing property 
line, you could assign a different style that displays the bearing and distance 
text slanted—a common practice for differentiating text that refers to existing 
features. In another part of the drawing, you might assign a different style to a 
curve label so that the appropriate combination of dimensions is shown accord-
ing to local requirements.
Exercise 13.5: Apply Parcel Segment Label Styles
In this exercise, you’ll apply different parcel segment label styles to differentiate 
between different types of labels and to control the content that is shown for 
each label.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Parcel Segment Label Styles.dwg 
located in the Chapter 13 class data folder.
	
2.	 Zoom in to the bearing and distance labels along the west side of 
the project. 
Currently, these labels are all shown in a proposed style with both 
bearing and distance.
	 3.	 Click the label for the west side of the John Smith property, and then 
click Label Properties on the ribbon.
	
4.	 In the Properties window, change Line Label Style to (Span) Bearing 
And Distance With Crows Feet [Existing]. 
The color and text style of the label are changed, and the label now 
reflects the full length of the line.
	 5.	 On the Annotate tab of the ribbon, click Add Labels.
	
6.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Feature, select Parcel.
	
b.	 For Label Type, select Single Segment.

This side of the project 
is actually a mixture of

up to span across the 
outside of multiple 
end-to-end segments 
and display the overall 
length. Crow’s-feet are 
the curved tick marks 
at either end of the 
line that indicate the 
extents of the distance 
that is being labeled.

Editing Parcel Segment Labels Graphically
You can use a number of methods to graphically edit parcel segment labels. 
The labels are equipped with special grips that enable you to move them easily. 
You can also capitalize on their built-in dragged state in areas where there isn’t 
enough room for the label to be placed right on the line or curve. In addition, 
you can flip labels to change which side of a line or curve they are placed on, 
and you can reverse labels to change a NE bearing to SW and vice versa.
Exercise 13.6: Edit Parcel Segment Labels 
Graphically
In this exercise, you’ll employ several graphical editing techniques on parcel 
segment labels in your drawing. These include grip-editing, flipping, and revers-
ing labels as well as moving them to initiate their dragged state.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Labels Graphically.dwg located 
in the Chapter 13 class data folder. The drawing is zoomed in to lot 68.
Notice the bearing and distance labels for the west sides of lots 68 
and 62. The bearing is listed twice, which is redundant.
	
2.	 Click the label on the west side of lot 68, and then click Label 
Properties on the ribbon.

The bearing for the 
individual segments 
can be omitted because 
the bearing on the

the Properties window.
	
4.	 With the label still selected, click Flip Label on the ribbon. 
The label is now displayed on the west side of the line.
	
5.	 Click the diamond-shaped grip of the label, and slide it south to the 
line that is shared between lots 68 and 62. 
This bearing now serves both lots. Notice that this is a NE bearing, 
whereas those to the east are SW bearings.
	
6.	 With the label still selected, click Reverse Label on the ribbon. The 
bearing now reflects a SW orientation.
	
7.	 Press Esc to clear your current selection. Then repeat steps 2 through 
4 for the label on the west side of lot 62 using a label style of Distance. 
The label should now show only the distance, and it should be 
located on the east side of the line.
	
8.	 Use the Add Labels command to add a new distance label to the west 
side of lot 68. Don’t forget to flip the label so that it’s shown on the 
inside of the lot.
	
9.	 Click the curve label at the northwest corner of lot 68. Click the square 
grip, and drag it to the south and east. Place it in the open space 
between the lot 68 area label and the northwest corner of the lot. 
The label is reoriented, and a leader appears that points back to the 
curve (see Figure 13.5).

Creating Parcel Tables
As you can guess, property drawings can become cluttered with many labels 
for areas, bearings, distances, and curve dimensions. As the drawing becomes 
more complex, it might make sense to put all that information in a table instead 
of trying to place it directly on the lines and curves. Line labels can be replaced 
with tags such as L1, L2, and so on, and the same can be done for curves. These 
abbreviated labels take up much less space than the full bearing and distance 
labels, making the drawing appear less cluttered and easier to read. Of course, 
the trade-off is that now the person viewing the drawing will have to scan back 
and forth between the drawing and the table to obtain all the information that 
pertains to a given parcel. This is why not all drawings use tables to store par-
cel information. A drawing can be read more easily, and information obtained 
from it more efficiently, if the labels are placed directly on the lines and curves. 
However, for some drawings you simply can’t show the information directly on 
the lines and curves, and you must use a table.
Creating Area Tables
You can use area tables to display information about each parcel in the drawing. 
Depending on the table style you use, you can vary the amount of information 
as well as the formatting.
One thing you’ll probably need to do prior to creating an area table is renumber 
the lots. You do this by using the Renumber/Rename command on the ribbon.
Exercise 13.7: Create an Area Table
In this exercise, you’ll first renumber the lots in the drawing. Then you’ll cre-
ate an area table that shows the lot number and corresponding area for each 
lot parcel.

Creating Parcel Segment Tables
The process of creating parcel segment tables is similar to the way you create 
area tables. You can select the segments that are listed in the table based on 
their label style or select each segment individually. When a segment is listed 
in the table, its label is transformed into a tag that simply assigns a number to 
the segment. Usually, you’ll want to renumber these tags to follow a sequential 
order that matches how they are laid out in the drawing. You can do this using 
the Renumber Tags command on the ribbon.
You can create three types of segment tables: line, curve, and segment. The last 
type (segment) is simply a combination of line and curve data in the same table.
Exercise 13.8: Create a Parcel Segment Table
In this exercise, you’ll create a parcel segment table that will contain curve tag 
numbers and corresponding curve geometry information. This will improve the 
appearance and clarity of the drawing by taking crowded curve labels and mov-
ing their information to a neat, organized table.

Designing Gravity 
Pipe Networks
With the completion of parcel design, you’re ready to move on to another 
major area of design: pipe design. One type of pipe design that you must 
address as a designer is the safe and efficient collection and conveyance of 
water that falls on a site during a rainstorm. This type of pipe design is part 
of a larger design process called stormwater management. Because the 
development of land often involves turning absorbent surfaces (soft grassy 
soil, trees, and forest floors) into impervious surfaces (pavement, concrete, 
and asphalt rooftops), rain that falls on a developed site will travel farther 
and much faster when compared to rain that fell on the site before it was 
developed. This water on the move can cause erosion or flooding, so it must 
be safely collected and placed in surface channels or underground pipes. The 
pipes and channels then carry the water to a safe place where it can be dis-
charged without doing harm.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

Understanding Gravity Pipe Networks
Pipe network design in the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software is divided into two 
types: gravity networks and pressure networks. Because the performance 
requirements for these two types of systems are so different, the approach to 
designing and constructing them is also quite different. In this chapter, we’ll 
cover gravity pipe network design.

2 7 4  
C h ap t e r 14  • D e s i g n i n g  G r av i t y Pi p e  N e t w o r k s
For a gravity pipe network design to be a success, it must meet the following 
basic requirements:
▶
▶The pipes must be sloped enough for water to flow through them.
▶
▶The pipes must be large enough to allow the expected amount of 
water to pass.
▶
▶The pipes must be far enough underground to avoid being damaged 
by freezing or by activities on the site.
▶
▶The pipes must not be so far underground that it’s cost prohibitive to 
install them.
▶
▶Structures must be provided that allow people to access the pipes to 
perform maintenance.
▶
▶In the case of stormwater management, structures must be provided 
that allow surface water to enter the pipes.
These requirements relate to two basic types of gravity pipe design compo-
nents: structures and pipes. This chapter describes these components as well as 
their relationship to each other when represented in a Civil 3D pipe network.
Understanding Structures
Structures provide access to the pipes underground. This access can be for 
people, or it can be for rainwater that is flowing across the surface of the ground, 
also known as runoff. In the case of stormwater management design, structures 
called inlets or catch basins are placed on the site at locations that are best for 
collecting runoff. Typically, the runoff falls through a grate into a concrete cham-
ber and then out through a pipe toward its final destination. For other types of 
pipelines, manholes and cleanouts are placed at predetermined increments so 
that workers can access the pipes to perform maintenance. Manholes are also 
used to create a bend in a pipeline when one pipe enters in one direction and a 
second pipe exits in another. Whatever the case, the placement of these struc-
tures is part of the pipe network design process, and it isn’t done arbitrarily.
Understanding Pipes
Pipes are used to safely convey water to a predetermined destination. In the case 
of stormwater pipes, collected runoff commonly passes through one or more 
forms of onsite treatment and then empties into a nearby stream or ditch. In the 
case of a sanitary sewer, the journey can be much longer—connecting to a local 

 
Un d e r s t a n d i n g G r av i t y Pi p e  N e t w o r k s	
2 7 5
sewer main, and then merging with any number of larger and larger mains until 
the water reaches a treatment plant. In some cases, the length of that journey 
can be quite a few miles.
In these systems, the flow of water depends on gravity. This means part of 
your job as the designer is to ensure that all the pipes are pointing downhill. 
That may sound like an easy task by itself, but when you introduce other design 
requirements, it can become quite challenging. For example, you also need to 
ensure that the pipes are at a depth that is neither too shallow nor too deep. 
Another part of the design is to ensure that the pipes are large enough to convey 
the amount of water that is expected. This part is usually handled by a licensed 
engineer or trained designer and is beyond the scope of this book.
Exploring the Pipe Network
Civil 3D enables you to create objects that represent structures and pipes. It 
also establishes relationships between the structures and pipes as well as other 
important design elements such as surfaces, alignments, profiles, and profile 
views. The pipes, the structures, and their associated relationships are referred 
to as a Civil 3D pipe network. In Figure 14.1, a plan view of a few pipes and 
structures is shown on the left, and the same pipes and structures are shown in 
profile view on the top right and 3D view on the bottom right.

right-click each component to access various context commands for it. You can 
also use the item view at the bottom of Prospector to edit information about each 
component. Figure 14.2 shows the contents of a pipe network in Prospector.

The shape, dimensions, and behavior of a pipe network component are deter-
mined by the part that represents it. Parts are stored in a parts list, which is a 
kind of library from which you can select parts for the different components in 
your pipe network. Most companies have several parts lists, each one containing 
parts for a certain type of system such as storm, sanitary, or water. Parts lists 
can be stored in a template file so they are available in each new drawing that is 
created from that template. Figure 14.3 shows an example of a very basic parts 
list that would be used for storm sewer design.

Creating Gravity Pipe Networks
Gravity pipe networks can be created in two basic ways. The first is to create a 
pipe network from one or more objects that have been drawn beforehand, such 
as lines, arcs, or a polyline. With this approach, all the pipes and structures are 
created at once. The other approach is to create the pipes and structures one by 
one. This is referred to as creating a pipe network by layout.
Creating a Pipe Network from Objects
At times, you’ll find it easier to start with AutoCAD® commands to sketch your 
pipe network using basic entities. This approach works well because Civil 3D 
provides a command that converts these basic entities to pipe networks: the 
Create Pipe Network From Object command. This command creates pipe net-
works from Civil 3D alignments and feature lines as well. One disadvantage to 
this method is that the same parts are used for pipes and structures throughout 
the entire network.
Exercise 14.1: Create a Pipe Network from Objects
In this exercise, you’ll use the Create Pipe Network From Object command to 
create several sanitary sewer networks from polylines provided in the drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Pipe Networks From Objects.dwg 
located in the Chapter 14 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the left viewport, zoom in to the beginning of the Jordan Court 
alignment at the north end of the project. 
Note the heavy green polyline marked SAN that has been sketched 
in to represent the location of a new sanitary sewer pipeline.
	
3.	 On the Home tab of the ribbon, click Pipe Network ➢ Create 
Pipe Network From Object.
	
4.	 Click the green polyline with the SAN label on it. Press Enter to 
accept the current flow direction.
	
5.	 In the Create Pipe Network From Object dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Network Name, enter Sanitary.
	
b.	 For Network Parts List, select Sanitary Sewer.

Creating a Pipe Network by Layout
If you haven’t sketched the pipe design, or when you want more control of the 
design as you go, the best choice is to create a pipe network by layout. This is 
done by using the Pipe Network Creation Tools command. After you launch this 
command and enter some information about the pipe network, you’re presented 
with the Network Layout Tools toolbar (see Figure 14.5). This is similar to the 
toolbars you have used for other layout designs, such as creating alignments by 
layout or profiles by layout.
F i g u r e   1 4 . 5    The Network Layout Tools toolbar
From the Network Layout Tools toolbar, you can choose pipes and structures 
from a parts list and then use commands on the toolbar to insert those parts 
into the drawing. You can change parts at any time and apply different types 
and sizes as you go. As you draw pipes and structures, special icons next to the 
cursor inform you when you’re connecting parts to one another. For example, 
Figure 14.6 shows a pipe being drawn between two inlets. The yellow icon 
indicates that the pipe will be connected to the inlet when the user clicks the 
mouse.
Now all the sketch 
polylines have been 
converted to sanitary 
sewer pipes and 
structures.

Notice that one of the 
pipes along Madison 
Lane is located at a 
much lower elevation 
than the others. This 
will be addressed later 
in this chapter.

being overloaded, additional inlets have been placed between low 
points and high points to collect some of the runoff. Figure 14.7 fur-
ther illustrates inlet placement in the drawing.

Drawing a Pipe Network in a Profile View
Viewing a pipe network in a profile view is critical to performing an accurate 
design. The depths, slopes, and elevations of an underground pipe system are 
every bit as important as the horizontal location of each component on the plan. 
Civil 3D enables you to represent a pipe network in profile view, which is the ideal 
way to visualize and modify the vertical aspect of a pipe network design.
You can use the Draw Parts In Profile command to draw an entire network in 
profile view or to draw select parts. When this is done, the pipes and structures 
shown in plan view are the same pipes and structures shown in profile view. Any 
change or addition to the pipe network will be visible in both views.
Exercise 14.3: Draw a Pipe Network in Profile View
In this exercise, you’ll use the Draw Parts In Profile command to show the 
storm network in a profile view.

Editing Gravity Pipe Networks
As you might guess, the tools for editing pipe networks are even more extensive 
than the tools used to create them. This is one reason the recommended way to 
approach pipe design is to perform a rough layout and then use the editing tools 
to perfect the design. As you’re about to learn, Civil 3D provides many ways to edit 
pipe networks. In the following sections, the ways to edit pipe networks are pre-
sented in four groups: grips, editing tools, properties, and the Pipe Network Vistas.
Editing Pipe Networks Using Grips
Grips are a great tool for making quick and simple graphical edits. Civil 3D pro-
vides the following specialized grips for pipes and structures:
Structure – Square Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the location of the 
structure without changing its rotation. As a structure is moved, the ends of 
any pipes that connect to it move with it.
Structure – Circular Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the rotation of the 
structure without changing its location.
Structure – Top Triangular Grip – Profile View    This grip changes the 
elevation of the top of the structure. Use caution when editing the top of a struc-
ture because, depending on its properties, the software may automatically reset 
it to match a surface.
Structure – Bottom Triangular Grip – Profile View    This grip changes 
the elevation of the sump (inside floor) of the structure. This elevation can’t be 
placed above the invert (bottom of the inside wall) of the lowest incoming pipe.
Pipe Midpoint – Triangle Grip – Plan View    This grip is used to change the 
diameter of a pipe. Dragging it away from the pipe increases the diameter, and 
dragging it toward the pipe decreases the diameter. This grip can be used in 
conjunction with the AutoCAD Dynamic Input feature to view the diameter or 
even type it in.

2 8 6  
C h ap t e r 14  • D e s i g n i n g  G r av i t y Pi p e  N e t w o r k s
Pipe Midpoint – Square Grip – Plan View    This grip moves the pipe to a 
new location without changing its angle or its slope.
Pipe Endpoint – Square Grip – Plan View    This grip moves the location of 
one end of the pipe while keeping the other end fixed. In profile view, it main-
tains the current elevation of that end of the pipe.
Pipe Endpoint – Triangular Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the length 
of the pipe while maintaining the angle of the pipe and the location of the oppo-
site end.
Pipe Endpoint Grips – Profile View    These grips change the elevation of a 
pipe at its endpoint. The diamond-shaped grip at the top sets the crown (top 
of the inside wall) elevation. The diamond-shaped grip at the bottom sets the 
invert (bottom of the inside wall) elevation. The triangular grip sets the cen-
terline elevation. These grips can be used in conjunction with the AutoCAD 
Dynamic Input feature to view the elevation or even type it in. They don’t 
change the horizontal location of the pipe’s endpoint.
Pipe Midpoint – Square Grip – Profile View    This grip changes the eleva-
tion of the pipe without changing its slope. It doesn’t affect the location of the 
pipe in plan view.
You should note that when you change the location of the endpoint of a pipe 
in plan view, the structure connected to it doesn’t move with it. To place the 
structure at the end of the pipe, you must move the structure as a separate 
action. If you don’t update the location of the structure, the pipe may reset to 
match the structure at some point in the future.
Exercise 14.4: Edit a Pipe Network Using Grips
In this exercise, you’ll use grips to make some adjustments to the storm 
network.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Pipe Networks Using Grips.dwg 
located in the Chapter 14 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the plan view on the left, zoom in to the inlets located at station 
5+50 (0+170).

3.	 Click both inlets to select them, and then click the circular grip on 
the inlet to the east.
	
4.	 Click the square grip of the west inlet. 
This rotates the east inlet to align it with the west inlet, which also 
aligns the east inlet with the curb.
	
5.	 If it isn’t already turned on, click the Dynamic Input icon at the 
bottom of your screen to turn it on.
	
6.	 Zoom in to the pipe at station 5+50 (0+170), and select it. Click the 
triangular grip at the midpoint of the pipe.
	
7.	 Drag the grip away from the pipe, and click when the dynamic input 
text box reads 1.5 (0.450). Or you can just type 1.5 (0.450) in the box, 
as shown in Figure 14.11. 
This changes the diameter of the pipe to 18 inches (450mm).

Editing Pipe Networks Using Editing Tools
Another way to edit a pipe network is to use the Network Layout Tools tool-
bar, which is the same toolbar you used initially to create the pipe network. To 
launch the toolbar in editing mode instead of creation mode, you use the Edit 
Pipe Network command.
In addition to the Network Layout Tools toolbar, there are several com-
mands located on the ribbon and in a context menu that give you even more 
functionality:
Swap Part    This command calls up the current parts list, and it enables you to 
select a part and replace it with any part in the parts list.
Disconnect Part    This command disconnects a pipe from a structure, enabling 
you to connect it to a different part or move it independently of other parts.

Connect Part    This command connects a pipe to a structure to reestablish the 
dynamic behavior of connected parts.
Split Network    This command divides a network into two separate networks.
Merge Networks    This command combines two or more networks into a 
single network.
Exercise 14.5: Edit Pipe Networks Using  
Editing Tools
In this exercise, you’ll use the ribbon commands and Network Layout Tools 
toolbar to edit the storm and sanitary networks in your drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Pipe Networks Using Editing 
Tools.dwg located in the Chapter 14 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click any storm pipe or structure in the drawing, and then click Edit 
Pipe Network on the ribbon. 
This opens the Network Layout Tools toolbar.

Editing Pipe Networks Using Properties
Many of the values you need to change when editing pipes and structures can 
be found in their properties. There are two ways to access the properties of a 
pipe or structure: the Civil 3D method and the AutoCAD method. To use the 
Civil 3D method, you select a pipe or structure and then click Pipe Properties 
or Structure Properties on the ribbon. This method provides extensive informa-
tion about the pipe or structure, much of which can be edited to change the 
design. The one disadvantage of this method is that you must launch the Pipe 
Properties or Structure Properties command separately for each pipe or struc-
ture you want to edit.
With the AutoCAD method, you select the pipe or structure and then use the 
Properties command from the ribbon or the context menu. Here you’re given 
access to a limited number of properties, but the advantage is that you can 
modify multiple pipes or structures simultaneously.
Exercise 14.6: Edit a Pipe Network Using 
Properties
In this exercise, you’ll fix the issue with the sanitary pipe that is located far 
below the others. You’ll use properties to complete this task. The problem with 
the incorrect pipe elevation was brought to your attention during the first exer-
cise in this chapter, when the sanitary sewer pipe networks were first created.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Pipe Networks Using 
Properties.dwg located in the Chapter 14 class data folder. 
In this exercise, you’ll focus on the sanitary sewer pipes that lie in 
Madison Lane. In the profile view on the top right, notice that the 
pipe beginning at the intersection with Logan Court and ending at 
the Madison Lane cul-de-sac has been incorrectly placed at a very 
low elevation.
	
2.	 In the upper-right viewport, zoom in to the Madison Lane profile and 
note the label at the right end that reads ELEV = 180.972 (55.160). 
This elevation corresponds with the center point of the cul-de-sac, 
which is also the location of the manhole.
	
3.	 Click in the left viewport, and then zoom in and click the manhole 
located at the center of the Madison Lane cul-de-sac. Click Structure 
Properties on the ribbon.

4.	 On the Part Properties tab of the Structure Properties dialog box, do 
the following:
	
a.	 For Automatic Surface Adjustment, select False.
	
b.	 For Insertion Rim Elevation, enter 180.972 (55.160).
	
c.	 Click OK.
In the 3D viewport, you’ll see the manhole become very tall, like 
the one just down the road from it.
This corrects the top elevation of the structure, but the pipe still 
requires some editing.
	
5.	 Press Esc to clear the selection of the manhole. Then, in the left 
viewport, select the pipe that begins at the Madison Lane cul-de-sac. 
Right-click, and select Properties.
	
6.	 In the Properties window, change Start Invert Elevation to 176.972 
(53.941).
	
7.	 With the pipe still selected, click Pipe Properties on the ribbon.
	
8.	 On the Part Properties tab of the Pipe Properties dialog box, enter 
-1.5 for Pipe Slope (Hold Start). Click OK. 
The effects of these pipe edits are much more obvious in the 3D 
viewport. The pipe is corrected, but the sump of the manhole at the 
cul-de-sac is still incorrect.
	
9.	 Press Esc to clear the selection of the pipe. Click the manhole at 
the center of the Madison Lane cul-de-sac, right-click, and select 
Structure Properties.
	
10.	 Although it’s already set to 2.000 (0.600), type 2 (0.6) for Sump 
Depth, and press Enter. Click OK. 
The manhole depth is updated because the apparent change to the 
sump depth triggered a recalculation of the manhole dimensions. If 
you’re zoomed in closely to the profile view in the top-right viewport, 
it may seem as though it has disappeared.

Editing Pipe Networks Using the Pipe Network 
Vistas
The pipe network editing methods you’ve learned about thus far in this chap-
ter are great for working with individual pipes and structures, but what if you 
want to see the entire network or make edits to multiple parts simultaneously? 
Luckily, you can do these things with the Pipe Network Vistas command, which 
opens Panorama and displays two tabs: Structures and Pipes. Each of these tabs 
displays all the pipes or structures in the entire network in a spreadsheet format, 
enabling you to view and edit the properties of multiple components at once.
The Pipe Network Vistas button is located near the right end of the Network 
Layout Tools toolbar (see Figure 14.15).

Chapter 15
Designing Pressure 
Pipe Networks
Now that you have studied gravity pipe networks, it’s time to move on 
to a different type of pipe design: one that involves pipes under pressure. If 
you’re unfamiliar with pipe design, you may be surprised to discover that the 
design process for gravity and pressure systems is quite different. For this 
reason, the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software provides two unique tool sets: one 
for gravity pipe design and one for pressure pipe design.
Pressure pipe design most commonly refers to water supply lines but it can 
also apply to natural gas and sanitary sewer lines. These pipelines provide 
valuable utility services to the new residents of the land you’re developing 
and must undergo extensive design to ensure that they function as intended 
and integrate well with surrounding features, whether new or existing.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Understand pressure pipe networks
▶
▶Create pressure pipe networks
▶
▶Edit pressure pipe networks
Understanding Pressure Pipe Networks
Gravity system designs and pressure system designs are quite different and 
must be addressed using different tools. For a pressure pipe network design 
to be a success, it must meet the following basic requirements:
▶
▶The bends and curves must be constructed according to industry-
standard fittings and allowable joint deflections.
▶
▶The pipes must be sized according to specific flows and pressures.

2 9 8  
C h ap t e r 15  • D e s i g n i n g  P r e s s u r e  Pi p e  N e t w o r k s
▶
▶The pipes must be far enough underground to avoid being damaged 
by freezing or by activities on the site.
▶
▶The pipes must not be so far underground that it is cost prohibitive 
to install them.
▶
▶Appurtenances such as valves and hydrants must be included in the 
design to allow the lines to be controlled, accessed, and maintained.
These requirements relate to three basic types of pressure pipe design compo-
nents: fittings, pipes, and appurtenances. This chapter describes these compo-
nents as well as their relationship to each other when represented in a Civil 3D 
pressure network.
Understanding Fittings, Angles, and 
Appurtenances
Pressure pipe fittings serve two purposes. The first, like structures in gravity sys-
tems, is to enable two or more pipes to connect. For example, a tee or wye fitting 
provides a connection for three pipes, and a crossing fitting provides a connection 
for four. The second purpose of a fitting is to create a bend in the direction of the 
pipeline, the angle of which is typically dictated by manufacturing standards. For 
example, elbows are commonly available in 90°, 45°, 22.5°, and 11.25° versions. For 
this reason, bend angles are a big part of pressure pipe design.
In addition to bend angles, a slight amount of deflection is allowed within 
connections. This deflection angle is part of the design and varies depending on 
how the pipes or fittings have been manufactured. This allowable deflection also 
enables a series of pipes to form a curve by providing a little deflection at each 
joint but without bending the pipes. Therefore, pressure pipes can be laid out on 
a curve, with the radius determined by the allowable deflection.
Another factor that can be incorporated into the design is the allowable bend-
ing radius of the pipes. Bending the pipes is another way a system can be laid 
out along a curve. The allowable bending radius is a function of the size, mate-
rial, and manufacturer specifications of the pipe.
Because of available fittings, allowable deflection angles, and allowable bend 
radius, each bend in a pressure pipe is a design in itself. As a designer, you’ll be 
required to choose the right combination of fitting, deflection angle, and bend 
radius to make each bend in the pipeline.
Appurtenances are another component of pressure pipe designs. The chal-
lenge with appurtenances is that they usually require consideration for human 
access. For example, a fire hydrant must be properly located at ground level so 
that firefighters or maintenance personnel can access it.

Understanding Pressure Pipes
Like gravity pipes, pressure pipes are used to convey a substance, but the main 
difference, of course, is that the substance is moved by pressure rather than 
gravity. For this reason, elevations aren’t nearly as important to ensure adequate 
flow. They are important, however, to ensure that the pipeline has adequate 
cover to prevent freezing or physical damage and that it avoids underground 
obstacles, including other pipes. In the event of a conflict, because pressure pipe 
flow isn’t dependent on elevation, a designer will typically bend a pressure pipe 
to avoid a gravity pipe rather than the other way around. As discussed previ-
ously, the required bends are a design challenge because of the limitations of 
available fittings and deflection angles.
Exploring the Pressure Network
Civil 3D enables you to create objects that represent fittings, pipes, and appur-
tenances. It also establishes relationships between these components as well 
as relationships with other important design elements such as surfaces, align-
ments, profiles, and profile views. The pipes, fittings, and appurtenances and 
their associated relationships are referred to as a Civil 3D pressure network. In 
Figure 15.1, a few pipes and fittings are shown in plan view on the left, profile 
view in the center, and 3D view on the right.
F i g u r e   1 5 . 1    A pressure network shown in plan view (left), profile view (center), and

Each component of a pressure network is shown in Prospector beneath the 
Pressure Networks node. From here, you can right-click each component to 
access various context commands for it. You can also use the item view at the

bottom of Prospector to edit information about each component. Figure 15.2 
shows the contents of a pressure network in Prospector.
F i g u r e   1 5 . 2    A pressure network shown in Prospector
Just as in gravity networks, the shape, dimensions, and behavior of a pres-
sure network component are determined by the part that represents it. Pressure 
networks have their own parts lists, separate from gravity networks. Most com-
panies have several parts lists, each one containing parts for a certain type of 
system such as water, sanitary, or natural gas.
Creating Pressure Pipe Networks
As with gravity networks, pressure networks can be created in one of two ways. 
The first is to lay out the pressure network using basic AutoCAD® entities such 
as lines or polylines and then convert those objects to a pressure network. 
Another is to create the pressure network using layout tools. One difference 
with pressure networks is that the layout tools are housed in the ribbon rather 
than on a toolbar. The specialized ribbon tab (see Figure 15.3) is launched by 
using the Pressure Network Creation Tools command.

Creating a Pressure Network from Objects
At times, you’ll find it easier to start with AutoCAD commands to sketch your 
pressure network using basic entities. This approach works quite well because 
Civil 3D provides a command that converts these basic entities to pressure net-
works: the Create Pressure Network From Object command. This command 
creates pipe networks from Civil 3D alignments and feature lines as well. One 
disadvantage of this method is that the same parts are used for pipes and fit-
tings throughout the entire network.
Exercise 15.1: Create a Pressure Network from 
Objects
In this exercise, you’ll create a waterline pressure network along Madison Lane 
by converting objects in the drawing. You’ll also draw that pressure network in 
profile view.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Pressure Networks from 
Objects.dwg located in the Chapter 15 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the left viewport, note the heavy blue polyline along Madison 
Lane labeled with W, indicating a schematic location for a proposed 
waterline.
	
3.	 On the Home tab of the ribbon, click Pipe Network ➢ Create 
Pressure Network From Object.
	
4.	 Click the heavy blue polyline, and press Enter to accept the default 
direction assumed by the command.
	
5.	 In the Create Pressure Pipe Network From Object dialog box, do the 
following:
	
a.	 For Network Name, enter Madison Lane Water.
	
b.	 For Network Parts List, select Water Supply.
	
c.	 For Size And Material, select 4 INCH (100mm) DUCTILE IRON.

Pressure Networks from Feature Lines
You may have noticed the Use Vertex Elevations option in the Create Pressure Pipe 
Network From Object dialog box. If you create a pressure network from a feature 
line, you can use this option to set the elevations of the pipes and fittings based 
on the elevations of the feature line. You can also choose the reference point 
that is used when assigning elevations such as Outside, Top, Crown, Centerline, 
and so on. This is an effective way to convert a rough 3D sketch of a pressure 
pipe design into a full-fledged 3D pressure network model.
Creating a Pressure Network by Layout
Another way to create pressure networks is using the Pressure Network Creation 
Tools command. When you launch this command, you will see a specialized 
ribbon tab (as shown previously in Figure 15.3) that contains tools for pressure 
network layout. From this specialized ribbon tab, you can choose the pipes, 
fittings, and appurtenances from the parts list and use the commands on the 
ribbon to insert those parts into the drawing. You can change parts at any time 
and apply different types and sizes as you go.
To guide your design, Civil 3D provides a compass (see Figure 15.5), which displays 
the bend angles and deflections available at a given point, based on information 
stored in the parts list. The compass automatically “snaps” your cursor to an available 
bend angle to prevent you from laying out a nonstandard bend in the pipeline.

Another fundamental difference with pressure network layout is that you pro-
vide a value for cover, and Civil 3D automatically sets the elevation at each end 
of a pipe according to that value. You can change the cover value as you design.

Editing Pressure Pipe Networks
Before editing a pressure network, it’s best to display it in profile view so that 
you can analyze your design from more than one perspective. This is done 
using the Draw Parts In Profile View command, much as you did with grav-
ity networks. And just like gravity networks, pressure networks can be edited 
using four basic approaches: grips, layout tools, properties, and Pipe Network 
Vistas. Of these four approaches, the grips and layout tools approaches differ 
◀
Notice the difference 
in the compass, which 
now shows available 
bend angles rather 
than deflections. The 
available angles are 
based on the fittings 
listed in the parts list.

considerably from how they are applied in gravity systems. The sections entitled, 
“Editing Pressure Networks Using Grips” and “Editing Pressure Networks Using 
the Plan Layout Tools” explain the details of how these two approaches are 
applied to pressure networks. 
Editing Pressure Networks Using Grips
Grips are a great tool for making quick and simple graphical edits. Civil 3D pro-
vides the following specialized grips for pressure pipes and fittings:
Fitting – Square Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the location of the fit-
ting without changing its rotation. As the fitting is moved, the ends of any pipes 
that connect to it will move with it.
Fitting – Arrow Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the direction of the fit-
ting by flipping it around the axis of the connecting pipe.
Fitting – Diamond Grip – Plan View    This grip slides the fitting along the 
pipe it’s connected to without changing the rotation angle of the fitting.
Fitting – Plus Grip – Plan View    This grip creates a new pipe projecting from 
the end of the fitting, with the angle restricted to the allowable deflection at the 
joint. This grip doesn’t appear in a location where a pipe is already connected.
Fitting – Diamond Grip – Profile View    This grip changes the elevation of 
the fitting.
Pipe Endpoint – Square Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the location 
of one end of the pipe without changing the location of the other. It’s available 
only if neither end of the pipe is connected to a fitting.
Pipe Endpoint – Diamond Grip – Plan View    This grip swings the pipe 
around a fitting at the opposite end. A graphic displays the allowable deflection 
but doesn’t restrict movement to stay within it. This grip doesn’t change the 
length of the pipe.

	
E d i t i n g P r e s s u r e Pi p e N e t w o r k s	
3 0 7
Pipe Endpoint – Plus Grip – Plan View    This grip creates a new fitting and 
pipe projecting from the end of the pipe you’ve selected. The angle of the new pipe 
is restricted to the allowable angles as per the fittings in the parts list. This grip 
doesn’t appear in a location where a fitting is already connected.
Pipe Endpoint – Triangular Grip – Plan View    This grip changes the length 
of the pipe while maintaining the angle of the pipe and the location of the oppo-
site end. If the pipe is curved, it maintains the radius of the pipe while extending 
it along its own curvature.
Pipe Midpoint Grip – Plan View    For a straight pipe, this grip changes the 
location of the pipe without changing its rotation. It disconnects the pipe from 
any fittings it’s attached to. For a curved pipe with a connection at both ends, 
this grip changes the radius of the curve without changing the location of 
either endpoint. If one or both of the ends aren’t connected, it works the same 
as if it’s a straight pipe.
Pipe Endpoint Grips – Profile View    These grips change the elevation of a 
pipe at its endpoint. The diamond-shaped grip at the top sets the crown (top 
of the inside wall) elevation. The diamond-shaped grip at the bottom sets the 
invert (bottom of the inside wall) elevation. The triangular grip sets the cen-
terline elevation. These grips can be used in conjunction with the AutoCAD 
Dynamic Input feature to view the elevation or even type it in. They don’t 
change the horizontal location of the pipe’s endpoint.
Pipe Endpoint – Triangle Grip – Profile View    This grip changes the length 
of the pipe while holding its slope.
Pipe Midpoint – Square Grip – Profile View    This grip changes the eleva-
tion of the pipe without changing its slope. It doesn’t affect the location of the 
pipe in plan view. It disconnects the pipe from any fittings or appurtenances it’s 
connected to.
Pipe Midpoint – Circular Grip – Profile View    This grip curves the pipe by 
holding the endpoints and forcing it to pass through the new location that you 
select for the grip. Movement isn’t restricted based on allowable deflections.

Exercise 15.3: Edit a Pressure Network Using Grips
In this exercise, you’ll make some adjustments to the layout of the waterline 
pressure network along Jordan Court. You’ll use some of the specialized grips to 
make these adjustments in plan and profile.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Pressure Networks Using 
Grips.dwg located in the Chapter 15 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the left viewport, zoom in to the circle marked D1, and click the 
90° elbow fitting near its center. Click the fitting, and then click the 
square grip.
	
3.	 Snap to the center of the circle marked D2. The fitting moves to the new 
location along with the ends of the two pipes that are connected to it. 
The geometry of the fitting looks a bit odd at the moment because 
the fitting should be changed to a 45° elbow. This will be addressed in 
a later exercise.
	
4.	 In the lower-right viewport, click the curved pipe between E and F1; then 
click the triangular grip at circle F1. Snap to the center of circle F2.
	
5.	 Click the plus-sign grip at circle F2. On the ribbon, select EG as 
the surface, and change the Cover value to 4.5 (1.5). Select 6 INCH 
(150mm) DUCTILE IRON as the pipe size, and snap to the center of 
circle G.
	 6.	 Press Esc to end the current command and clear any selections in 
the drawing. Click the pipe between E and F2, and then click Draw 
Parts In Profile on the Pipe Networks: Water Main ribbon tab.
	
7.	 Click one of the grid lines of the Jordan Court profile view. 
The water pipe should appear in the profile view.
	
8.	 Press Esc to clear the current selection. Select all pipes and fittings 
from circle E to circle A; then use the Draw Parts In Profile command 
to add them to the profile view. 
The waterline should now appear in the profile view, as shown in 
Figure 15.7.
▶
If you haven’t already 
done so, download 
and install the files for 
Chapter 15 according to 
the instructions in this 
book’s Introduction.
The location of the next 
fitting will be outside 
the area covered by 
the Road FG surface, 
and it will therefore 
be based on EG surface 
elevations.
▶
▶
Notice how the end of 
the pipe isn’t located 
at the elevation of 
the center of circle G, 
even though that’s 
where you snapped. 
Civil 3D calculated the 
elevation based on the 
surface and the Cover 
value you specified.

Checking Design and Depth
Before performing any edits on a pressure network, you may find it helpful to 
use the Design Check and Depth Check commands to identify necessary edits. 
Both these commands are found on the Pressure Networks ribbon tab. The 
Design Check command checks for issues with deflection, mismatched pipe 
diameters, open connections, and radius of curvature. Depth Check finds issues 
with minimum and maximum cover.
Exercise 15.4: Check Design and Depth
In this exercise, you’ll check the waterline along Jordan Court for deflection and 
depth issues.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Checking Design and Depth.dwg located 
in the Chapter 15 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the pipe that runs from circle D2 to circle E. Then click Design 
Check on the ribbon.

ribbon tab, which is the same one you used initially to create the pressure 
network. To launch the ribbon in editing mode instead of creation mode, you 
select a component of the pressure network and then click Edit Network ➢ Plan 
Layout Tools (see Figure 15.8).

Editing Pressure Networks Using the Profile 
Layout Tools
As you may have noticed in Figure 15.8, there is also a Profile Layout Tools 
command. The editing tools available for pressure networks in profile view are a 
bit more numerous when compared to gravity networks. For example, with pres-
sure networks, you can add new pipes, add fittings, extend pipes, and perform 
several other functions that aren’t possible with gravity pipes. When you click 
the Profile Layout Tools command, the Pressure Network Profile Layout ribbon 
tab opens (see Figure 15.9); it provides many useful editing commands that are 
carried out in profile view.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand pressure networks and how they 
differ from gravity networks. You’re able to create pressure networks by converting objects 
already in the drawing or by creating them from scratch using the layout tools. You know 
several methods for editing pressure networks, including the use of grips, Plan Layout Tools, 
and Profile Layout Tools. 
You’re ready to begin creating and editing pressure networks in a production environment.

Chapter 16
Displaying and 
Annotating Pipe 
Networks
As you have learned with other types of design that I have discussed to 
this point, simply designing an object or a system isn’t the end of the story. 
Your ability to share important information about the design is as important 
as the design itself. After all, without the effective sharing of information, 
the design can’t be properly reviewed or constructed. Pipe network design is 
no different, and it relies heavily on graphical appearance and annotation to 
convey design information.
In this chapter, you’ll study the use of pipe, structure, fitting, and appur-
tenance styles to control the appearance of pipe networks in plan and pro-
file view. You’ll also learn about annotating pipe networks using labels and 
tables. In a more general sense, you’ll learn how to combine all these fea-
tures to effectively communicate the intent of your design to others.
In the previous two chapters, gravity and pressure networks were pre-
sented separately because they each require a unique approach for layout 
and design. The stylization and annotation of gravity and pressure networks 
are virtually the same, however, with the only exception being the differ-
ence between fitting styles and structure styles. For this reason, most of the 
information in this chapter doesn’t need to be duplicated for both types of 
networks as it was in the previous chapters.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Display pipe networks using styles
▶
▶Annotate pipe networks in plan view
▶
▶Annotate pipe networks in profile view
▶
▶Create pipe network tables

Displaying Pipe Networks Using Styles
Pipe and structure styles are two of the most sophisticated styles in the 
AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software. They provide many options for displaying the 
components of your pipe network design in plan, profile, model (3D), and even 
section view. It’s important to have many options for displaying pipe networks 
because often you have different types of systems in the same drawing that need 
to be differentiated graphically.
Applying Structure, Fitting, and Appurtenance 
Styles
Civil 3D styles provide a number of fundamental ways to display structures, fit-
tings, and appurtenances. In plan view, you can display a structure as an outline 
of its 3D form, or you can use an AutoCAD® block as a symbol representing the 
structure. When you use a block, you can determine its size according to the 
drawing scale, a fixed scale, or the actual dimensions of the part. Figure 16.1 
shows a structure represented using an AutoCAD block on the left and as an 
outline of its 3D shape on the right.

There are three ways to display a structure in profile view (Figure 16.2).
Solid    The structure is shown as a slice through the 3D model of the part, 
which means the size, shape, and dimensions are an accurate representation 
(see Figure 16.2, left). Any detail within the interior of the part is visible with 
this option.
Boundary    An outline of the 3D model of the part is shown (see Figure 16.2,

Block    A block (see Figure 16.2, right) is inserted and sized based on one of sev-
eral options. The most common option is to scale the block vertically to match 
the height of the part and horizontally to match the width of the part. A block 
can provide the desired appearance of the part, but because of the horizontal and 
vertical scaling, it may not be an exact dimensional match to the actual part.

Centerline    The Centerline option (see Figure 16.3, left) is the simplest choice 
and represents the fitting or appurtenance as a single line.
Catalog Defined Block    The Catalog Defined Block option (see Figure 16.3,

User Defined Block    The User Defined Block (see Figure 16.3, right) option 
allows you to use any AutoCAD block to represent the fitting or appurtenance.

In profile view, there are no options for the display of fittings and appurte-
nances; fittings are simply represented as an outline, and appurtenances are 
represented by a symbol that resembles their type.
As a designer, it isn’t likely that you’ll be responsible for configuring styles or 
having to choose which display configuration to use—these things are typically 
taken care of by a CAD manager. However, knowing the ways in which struc-
tures, fittings, and appurtenances can be displayed will be helpful when you’re 
asking your CAD manager to build some styles for you.
Exercise 16.1: Control the Display of Structures
In this exercise, you’ll assign different styles to gravity and pressure structures 
to change their appearance. You’ll observe the changes made to the appearance 
of those structures and see how they can potentially affect your design.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Structure and Fitting 
Styles.dwg located in the Chapter 16 class data folder. 
	 2.	 In the left viewport, click the sanitary manhole (the one with the S 
inside the circle), and then click Structure Properties on the ribbon. 
This opens the Structure Properties dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Information tab, and then select C-SSWR – Outline as the 
style. Click OK. 
This style shows the outline of the actual 3D part, which reveals 
that the manhole is actually much larger than the symbol suggests.
	 4.	 Press Esc to clear the selection of the sanitary manhole. Click the 
storm manhole (the one with the D inside the circle), and then select 
Structure Properties on the ribbon.
	
5.	 Change the style of this manhole to C-STRM – Outline. Click OK 
to dismiss the Structure Properties dialog. Press Esc to clear the 
selection.
With both manholes shown at their actual size, there is an obvious 
conflict (see Figure 16.4). Next you’ll use styles to change the appear-
ance of some pressure network structures.
	
6.	 In the left viewport, pan northward to the beginning of Jordan Court 
where the new water line ties to the existing water line. Click the tee 
fitting and the two elbow fittings near the connection point.
	
7.	 Right-click, and select Properties. Change the Style property to Water 3D.

It’s Not Called 3D for Nothing
The true form of a Civil 3D pipe or structure is a 3D object. For example, a manhole 
structure is typically some form of cylinder and is often somewhat complex, 
including tapers, eccentric cylinders, and so on. Some of the ways in which 
structures can be displayed involve slicing through this shape or showing an 
outline of it. In the following image, the same structure is shown from a 3D 
perspective (left), in plan view as an outline (center), and in profile view as a 
slice through the part (right). By using 3D representations of structures in your 
drawings, you can design more accurately and ensure that your structures aren’t 
conflicting with other underground objects.

manhole.

Applying Pipe Styles
A pipe object is a bit simpler than a structure object in that it’s essentially the 
extrusion of a circle, an ellipse, or a rectangle. Even so, the graphical represen-
tation of a pipe is broken down into numerous parts, each of which can be styl-
ized differently. Figure 16.5 shows a pipe and its components in profile view.
Pipe Hatch
Pipe Centerline
Inside Pipe Walls
Outside Pipe Walls
F i g u r e   1 6 . 5    A pipe in profile view
You can use pipe styles to control the various pipe components as follows:
Pipe Centerline    In addition to controlling the visibility and graphical proper-
ties of the pipe centerline, such as layer, color, and linetype, you can also control 
the width of the centerline in several ways, including setting it to match the 
diameter of the pipe. The striped appearance of the storm pipes you have seen in 
the example drawings was achieved by setting the centerline width to the inside 
pipe diameter and using a dashed linetype. 
▶
This may be acceptable 
for some instances, but 
when you need to see 
the exact dimensions 
of a manhole, you 
would use a different 
style.

 
D i s p l ay i n g Pi p e  N e t w o r k s U s i n g S t y l e s	
3 2 3
Inside and Outside Pipe Walls    You can use styles to control the visibility 
and graphical properties of the inner and outer walls.
Pipe End Line    This is a line drawn across either end of the pipe. The style can 
determine whether this line is drawn to the outer pipe wall or inner pipe wall.
Pipe Hatch    You can use a pipe style to hatch a pipe across its inside or outside 
diameter or in the area between the inner and outer walls. The pattern, scale, 
and rotation of the hatch can be specified as part of the style.
Crossing Pipe    You can use a pipe style to show a pipe as though it’s cross-
ing through the profile view rather than oriented parallel to it. This typically 
takes the form of an ellipse, either because of vertical exaggeration or because 
the pipe crosses through at an angle. This is extremely useful for ensuring that 
crossing pipes don’t conflict with one another. In profile view, you can control 
the visibility and graphical properties of the crossing pipe components such as 
inside walls, outside walls, and hatching.
Again, you aren’t likely to be responsible for creating the styles that configure 
these different display options. However, if you have a basic understanding of 
what is possible, you can more accurately request the specific styles you need 
from your CAD manager.
Exercise 16.2: Control the Display of Pipes
In this exercise, you’ll alter the appearance of two pipes by changing their style 
assignment. In one case, this change will be apparent in plan view, and in the 
other it will be shown in profile view.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Applying Pipe Styles.dwg located in the 
Chapter 16 class data folder. 
In this drawing, the left view is zoomed in to Logan Court where a 
sanitary pipe crosses a storm pipe, and the same pipes are shown in 
profile view on the top right and 3D view on the bottom right.
	
2.	 In the left view, click the green pipe labeled SAN. Click Pipe 
Properties on the ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Pipe Properties dialog box, click the Information tab. Change 
the style to C-SSWR – Double Line, and click OK.

shown as a double line 
representing the inside 
diameter.

sented as an ellipse. The ellipse is placed at the location where the 
storm pipe crosses the alignment (see Figure 16.6).

Profile View Overrides
The Profile View Properties dialog box has a special Pipe Networks tab that lists 
all the pipes and structures in the drawing. You can display any of them in a given 
profile view by simply checking a box in the Draw column. You can even perform 
a style override so that a pipe or structure can be displayed in a given profile 
view using a different style than the one assigned to it in the Pipe Properties 
dialog box. This is especially handy when you need to show a pipe using a crossing 
style in one profile view and using a “normal” style in another. The following 
image shows the Pipe Networks tab of the Profile View Properties dialog box.
Annotating Pipe Networks in Plan View
For a pipe system to function properly, it must be installed with a considerable 
amount of accuracy. And for this to take place, detailed information must be 
conveyed to the contractor installing the pipes and structures in the field. The 
most common way to do this is to add text to your drawing. With stations and 
offsets, you provide the horizontal location of each structure, and with slopes 
and elevations, you dictate the depth of each pipe and the slope needed for water 
to flow through it properly. These values are typically expressed to the near-
est hundredth of a foot or thousandth of a meter. It’s amazing to think that a 
trench can be excavated and a heavy concrete pipe laid in it with such accuracy, 
but it happens every day.
So far, you have worked with functions that create pipes and structures, edit 
their design, and control their graphical appearance in the drawing. In the fol-
lowing sections, you’ll learn how to annotate your design, which is arguably 

3 2 6  
C h ap t e r 16  • D i s p l ay i n g  a n d A nn o t at i n g Pi p e  N e t w o r k s
even more important than the design itself. The lines and symbols provide a 
useful picture of the design, but the stations, offsets, elevations, slopes, and so 
on provided by your annotations are used to make precise measurements that 
locate and orient each pipe and structure in the field.
Renaming Pipes and Structures
Many pipe network designs involve a large number of pipes and structures. For 
this reason, it’s good design practice to have a naming and/or numbering sys-
tem that helps you keep track of these many components. Before labeling pipes 
and structures, you should spend some time renaming them according to the 
system you’ll use.
Exercise 16.3: Rename Pipes and Structures
In this exercise, you’ll do some “bookkeeping” to rename the pipes and struc-
tures in the Storm1 network according to a numerical sequence.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Renaming Pipes and Structures.dwg 
located in the Chapter 16 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the viewport on the left, click the inlet at station 5+50 (0+170) that 
is on the east side of Jordan Court. Right-click, and select Properties.
	
3.	 In the Properties window, change the name to INLET-01. Press Esc 
to clear the selection, and then click the inlet across the street from 
INLET-01.
	
4.	 In the Properties window, change the name to INLET-02. Press Esc 
to clear the selection.
	
5.	 Click the pipe between INLET-01 and INLET-02, and change its name 
to STM-01.
	
6.	 Change the name of the pipe exiting INLET-02 to the north to STM-02.
	
7.	 Change the name of the manhole near station 3+50 (0+110) to STMH-01.
	
8.	 Continue working along the pipe network, renaming the inlets, 
pipes, and manholes according to this sequence. When you get to the 
final structure, the endwall, name it ENDWALL-01.
	
9.	 In Prospector, expand Pipe Networks ➢ Networks ➢ Storm1. Under 
Storm1, click Pipes.

Creating Labels in Plan View
To create labels in plan view, you use the Add Labels command. You can create 
labels one by one or for all the parts of the network at once. After the labels are 
in place, you may have to drag them to clear areas in the drawing so that they 
can be read more easily.
Exercise 16.4: Create Plan View Labels
In this exercise, you’ll create all the plan view labels at once for the Storm1 net-
work. The labels will be cluttered, but you’ll address that in the next exercise.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Labels in Plan View.dwg 
located in the Chapter 16 class data folder.
	
2.	 On the Annotate tab of the ribbon, click Add Labels.
	
3.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Feature, select Pipe Network.
	
b.	 For Label Type, select Entire Network Plan.
	
c.	 For Pipe Label Style, select C-STRM – Pipe Data (One Line).
	
d.	 For Structure Label Style, select C-STRM – Structure Data.
	
e.	 Click Add.
	
4.	 Click any pipe or structure in the storm network near the entrance to 
Jordan Court. 
Labels are added on every pipe and structure in the network, which 
makes the drawing look cluttered (see Figure 16.9).

Editing Labels in Plan View
After creating pipe network labels in your drawing, you may need to do a fair 
amount of editing to improve their appearance and readability. This can involve 
assigning different styles and/or moving the labels using their grips.
Exercise 16.5: Edit Plan View Labels
In this exercise, you’ll address the cluttered labeling created in Exercise 16.4. 
You’ll do this through a combination of grip-editing and assigning different styles.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Labels in Plan View.dwg 
located in the Chapter 16 class data folder.
	
2.	 In the left viewport, zoom in to INLET-01, which is on the east side 
of Jordan Court near station 5+50 (0+170). Click the label, and then 
click the square grip. Drag the label to an open area in the drawing 
where it isn’t conflicting with any other text or linework.

Annotating Pipe Networks in Profile View
Profile view is just as important as plan view for illustrating the design and 
providing important textual and numerical information about it. For this rea-
son, you’ll frequently have to provide profile labels in addition to plan labels. 
Often, you’ll duplicate the information shown in plan view, enabling the con-
tractor or the reviewer of the drawing to have the information they need in 
both places, without having to flip back and forth between drawings.
You don’t need to rename the pipes and structures for the profile view if you 
have already done so in plan view. This is because the plan and profile versions 
of the pipe network are the same objects viewed from different perspectives. In 
other words, renaming a pipe in plan view automatically renames it in profile 
view because the two versions of the pipe represent a single object.
Creating Labels in Profile View
Once again, creating pipe network labels in profile view is done using the Add 
Labels dialog box. You can use either the Entire Network Profile option to label 
all the pipes and structures at once or the Single Part Profile option to label 
them one by one.

Editing Labels in Profile View
Just as in plan view, you’ll most likely have to change the initial placement and 
styles of your profile view labels in order to make them easier to read. As you did 
before, you can assign different styles to change formatting, and you can use 
grips to move the labels. For some label styles, you have an extra grip located at 
the dimension anchor. The dimension anchor is a floating point that can only be 
moved vertically. This can be useful because you often need to move a label up or 
down to improve readability while maintaining its horizontal position on the pro-
file view. Additional dimension anchor settings enable you to position a label based 
on the location of a part or the profile view grid. Simply put, the dimension anchor 
gives you more options and more flexibility for label placement in profile view.

Creating Pipe Network Tables
As you have learned in previous chapters, tables are an effective way to convey 
information about a design. The main advantage of tables is that they organize 
the information in an orderly fashion, making it easy to read. The disadvantage 
is that the reader has two places to look for information: the main drawing for 
the graphical representation of the design and the table for the numerical and 
textual information. For this reason, tables are typically used if the main draw-
ing would be too cluttered or difficult to read if the textual and numerical infor-
mation were included in it.
In previous chapters, you created tables for parcels and alignments. One fun-
damental difference when working with pipe network tables is that they don’t 
need to reference labels in the drawing. For parcels and alignments, you had to 
create tag labels and then create the tables by selecting those labels. For a pipe 
network, the table references the pipes and structures directly, so no tag labels 
are required. However, it’s good practice to provide labels in the drawing that 
identify each pipe and structure so the reader of the drawing can see how they 
relate to the table.
Exercise 16.8: Create a Pipe Network Table
In this exercise, you’ll create a pipe network table and then create a series of 
labels in the drawing that will correlate the drawing objects with the table. 
You’ll edit these labels so that they are clear and legible.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Pipe Network Tables.dwg 
located in the Chapter 16 class data folder.
	
2.	 On the Annotate tab of the ribbon, click Add Tables ➢ Pipe 
Network ➢ Add Structure. This opens the Structure Table  
Creation dialog box.
	
3.	 For Table Style, select C-SSWR – Structure & Pipe Data.
	
4.	 Verify that By Network is selected and that Sanitary is chosen under 
Select Network. Click OK.
If you haven’t already 
done so, download 
and install the files for 
Chapter 16 according to 
the instructions in this 
book’s Introduction.

With these settings, 
all the pipes and struc-
tures in the sanitary 
pipe network will be 
included in the table. 
There is also a Multiple 
Selection option, 
which enables you to 
handpick the items you 
want represented in 
the table.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you’re able to change the appearance of struc-
tures and pipes by assigning different styles to them. You have learned the importance of 
good bookkeeping when working with pipe networks, and you know how to rename pipes  
and structures according to a logical labeling system. You can also create annotations for  
pipes and structures and edit them to create clear labeling in a drawing. You can do this in 
plan view as well as profile view. Finally, you’re able to create tables that show pipe network 
information and create labels in the drawing that show the correlation between the informa-
tion in the table and the items it represents. 
You’re ready to begin displaying and annotating pipes in a production environment.

With the labels you 
have added, a person 
reading the drawing 
can match the name 
of a pipe or structure 
with information in 
the table.

Designing New 
Terrain
With the completion of the pipe networks, the design of the road is nearly 
finished. It’s now time to move on to the next area of the design: the shap-
ing of the land, or grading, of the adjacent areas. In Chapter 9, “Designing 
in 3D Using Corridors,” you designed a 3D model of the road in the form of 
a corridor. This model will serve as a basis for much of the adjacent design 
that will take place, such as the shaping of individual lots and grading in the 
stormwater management area.
Each of these areas has unique design objectives. The individual lots will 
be shaped so that homes can be built on them without requiring significant 
earthmoving. The stormwater management area will require a pond to serve 
as a means of collecting and treating the stormwater runoff. These designs 
will serve as opportunities for you to study the two primary grading tools con-
tained in the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software: feature lines and grading objects.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

Understanding Grading
Grading is the term that is most often used to describe the shaping of the land 
as a construction or design activity. From a design perspective, it’s usually con-
sidered different than corridor design, which is also a form of terrain shaping 
but most often used for long, uniform, linear designs such as roads, channels, 
and so on. The term grading is typically used to describe shaping the land in 
small areas or modeling features that aren’t long and uniform.
The final product of a grading design is a surface—the same type of object you 
used to model the existing terrain in Chapter 4, “Modeling the Existing Terrain 
Using Surfaces.” As you may recall, to create a surface representing existing 
ground (EG) elevations, you use breaklines drawn along linear terrain features 
such as curb lines, ditch lines, and so on. You can use the Civil 3D tools to make 
these breaklines from data collected in the field by surveyors. To create a design 
surface, you draw breaklines along curbs and ditch lines that are going to be built 
in the field. The process is fundamentally the same as creating an EG surface 
except that, in this case, the linear features are part of your design. For example, 
in Figure 17.1, you see the grading design for a pond represented by the red and 
blue contours. Civil 3D tools were used to draw the edges of this pond according 
to the required design specifications such as size, shape, depth, and so on. The 
objects representing the edges were then used to build a pond surface.

Understanding Feature Lines
In Chapter 4, you used survey figures to serve as breaklines in the EG surface. 
For a design surface, you’ll use feature lines for most of your breaklines. Survey 
figures and feature lines are fundamentally similar: They are three-dimensional 
linear objects that can be named, stylized, and shown in Prospector. The pri-
mary difference is that you design feature lines, whereas survey figures are 
driven by data collected in the field.
Understanding Sites
When working with feature lines, you have to consider the use of sites. Feature 
lines in the same site are “aware” of one another and will try to interact if the 
opportunity presents itself. For example, if one feature line crosses over another 
feature line in the same site, one of the feature lines will bend so the two share 
the same elevation at the intersection point. The point where they intersect is 
called a split point. In cases where this interaction needs to be prevented, you 
can simply place each feature line in its own site. Figure 17.2 shows two crossing 
feature lines in plan view (left) and 3D view (right). Because these two feature 
lines are in the same site, a split point is created, causing the red feature line to 
bend so that it can match the green feature line.

Understanding Feature-Line Geometry
Feature lines have two types of points that define their geometry: PIs and  
elevation points. A PI is represented by a square grip and can be modified in 
all three dimensions. An elevation point is represented by a circle grip and has 

3 4 2  
C h ap t e r  17 • D e s i g n i n g N e w Te r r a i n
more constrained editing behavior. Figure 17.3 shows both types of grips on the 
same feature line. The elevation of an elevation point can be edited, but its loca-
tion in plan view must slide along the feature-line geometry determined by the 
PIs. This constrained behavior is actually quite handy because you can create 
many elevation points on a simple plan view shape such as a rectangle.

Creating Feature Lines
Civil 3D provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating feature lines. They 
can be drawn from scratch, by converting an AutoCAD® polyline, or by extract-
ing them from more complex Civil 3D objects such as corridors or profiles. 
When drawing a feature line from scratch, you must provide the elevation of 
each PI. For all other methods, the elevations are obtained from the object you 
have selected.
Exercise 17.1: Create Feature Lines
In this exercise, you’ll create feature lines representing elevations along a lot 
boundary as well as elevations for a building pad within the interior of the lot. 
You’ll create one feature line from a corridor, another from scratch by drawing 
it, and a third by selecting objects in the drawing.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Feature Lines.dwg located in 
the Chapter 17 class data folder. 
This drawing is zoomed in to lot 25 in the top-right and bottom-
right viewports. Also notice that the corridor layer has been thawed 
to reveal the road corridor.

Using Edit Geometry Commands
The feature-line geometry-editing commands provided by Civil 3D are as 
follows:
Insert PI    Use this command to insert a new PI at a point you specify. A PI can 
be edited in all three dimensions.
Delete PI    Use this command to remove PIs from the feature line.
Break    Use this command to break one feature line into two feature lines. You 
can do this by creating a gap between the two feature lines, or you can have 
them meet end to end.
Trim    Use this command to shorten a feature line by making it end precisely at 
another object.
Join    Use this command to join two or more feature lines to make one feature 
line. If there is a gap between the two feature lines, it must lie within a certain 
tolerance or they won’t be joined.
Reverse    Use this command to change the direction of the feature line. This 
swaps the beginning and ending points as well as reverses the direction of sta-
tioning. This can affect editing and labeling.
Edit Curve    Use this command to change the radius of a feature-line curve.
Fillet    Use this command to add a feature-line curve where there is currently 
a PI. The command includes options to set the radius of the curve and to create 
multiple fillets at once.
Fit Curve    Use this command to replace a series of line segments with an arc. 
This helps to simplify the feature line by replacing multiple points with an  
arc. This command differs from the Smooth command in that you can control 
where curves are created. Also, the curves it creates are static, meaning they 
don’t change when adjacent geometry changes.
Smooth    Use this command to replace PIs with curves. This command  
is different from the Fit Curve command in that it creates curves for the  
entire feature line and the curves are dynamic, meaning they remain tangent  
as the feature line is modified.

C h ap t e r  17 • D e s i g n i n g N e w Te r r a i n
Weed    Use this command to simplify a feature line by reducing the number of 
vertices. The command includes several options for determining which vertices 
to remove.
Stepped Offset    This command creates a new feature line that is parallel to 
another. The command includes several options for determining the elevations 
of the new feature line.

Using Edit Elevation Commands
The feature-line elevation-editing commands provided by Civil 3D are as follows:
Elevation Editor    Use this command to open the Grading Elevation Editor tab 
in Panorama. From here, you can perform a number of edits while viewing all 
the feature-line data at once.
Insert Elevation Point    Use this command to create one or more elevation 
points on a feature line.
Delete Elevation Point    Use this command to simplify a feature line by 
removing elevation points from it.
Quick Elevation Edit    Use this command to interactively edit the elevations 
and slopes of a feature line. The command uses tooltips to show you elevations, 
slopes, and slope directions.
Edit Elevations    Use this command to edit individual points and segments on 
the command line.
Set Grade/Slope Between Points    Use this command to set a constant grade 
through multiple points. You do this by specifying a start point and an endpoint, 
and the command calculates the elevations of any points in between.

	
E d i t i n g F e at u r e L i n e s	
3 4 9
Insert High/Low Elevation Point    Use this command to have Civil 3D cal-
culate a high or low point on a feature line. You do this by selecting two points 
and specifying the slope that should be projected from each point. Civil 3D then 
calculates the intersection of the two slopes and creates a point at the correct 
location and elevation. This command is especially useful for setting high and 
low points along curb lines to control drainage.
Raise/Lower By Reference    Use this command to adjust all the elevations of 
a feature line simultaneously by specifying a reference point and an elevation 
difference.
Set Elevation By Reference    Use this command to calculate the elevations of 
individual points on a feature line by specifying a reference point and an eleva-
tion difference for each point.
Adjacent Elevations By Reference    Use this command to project the eleva-
tions from one feature line to another while providing an elevation difference, if 
desired. This command is especially useful for parallel feature lines such as curb 
lines or wall lines.
Grade Extension By Reference    Use this command to calculate the elevation 
of a point on a feature line by extending the grade of another feature line.
Elevations From Surface    Use this command to project a feature line onto 
a surface. This command has the option to create elevation points at locations 
where the feature line crosses triangle edges in the surface. When this option is 
used, the feature line becomes an exact match to the terrain represented by the 
surface.
Raise/Lower    Use this command to edit all the elevations of a feature line 
simultaneously by providing an elevation difference.
Exercise 17.3: Edit Feature Lines with Elevation 
Commands
In this exercise, you’ll use the feature-line elevation-editing commands to place 
the lot 25 building pad at the correct elevation and to make the back-lot lines for 
lots 25 and 26 match existing ground elevations more closely.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Editing Feature Line Elevations.dwg

at an elevation slightly higher than the highest lot corner.
Your Pad or Mine?
For land-development projects that involve buildings, it’s common for the contrac-
tor to prepare a flat area where the building will be placed. This is often referred 
to as the building pad. In a residential development such as the example in 
this book, a building pad is often prepared for each lot to accommodate the 
home that will be built.

feature lines rather than designing them yourself. Examples of this situation 
would be projecting a slope through a certain distance or elevation or finding 
the intersection of a slope with a surface. For these cases, Civil 3D provides the 
grading object. Figure 17.8 shows a pond design composed of several grading

objects, each one using a different set of parameters to calculate an edge that 
defines the shape of the pond.
F i g u r e   1 7 . 8    A pond design composed of grading objects
A grading object is a collection of feature lines whose geometry, location, and 
elevation are calculated by Civil 3D based on design parameters that you have 
applied to a feature line. That’s quite a daunting definition, so here’s a look at it 
broken down into several parts:
▶
▶A grading object is a collection of feature lines (and other things not 
important to name at this time), so it behaves as one object. The fea-
ture lines in this collection have many of the same characteristics as 
individual feature lines as well as some unique characteristics that 
relate to being part of a grading object.
▶
▶Everything about a grading object is calculated by Civil 3D. Very 
similar to the way Civil 3D calculates a corridor, grading objects can’t 
be edited directly, but they respond automatically when their design 
parameters are edited. This is a little different from an individual fea-
ture line, which you can grip-edit at will.
▶
▶You assign the design parameters to a feature line. To create a grad-
ing object, you start by picking a feature line in the drawing. The 
design parameters you provide, such as slope, distance, elevation, 
and so on, are projected from this feature line to create the resulting 
grading object. A feature line that serves as the basis for a grading 
object is called a baseline.

Understanding Grading Criteria
The design parameters you apply to a grading object can require multiple pieces 
of information. For this reason, Civil 3D utilizes a system of grading criteria, 
which enables you to refer to a set of instructions by name rather than hav-
ing to re-specify them for each grading design. For example, you might have 
criteria with the name Curb, which instruct Civil 3D to project upward at a 
very steep slope for a very short distance. Similar criteria with names like Pond 
Embankment, Ditch Slope, and so on might be created alongside your Curb 
criteria. You can organize your named grading criteria even further by group-
ing them into grading criteria sets. For example, you might have one criteria set 
for pond grading, another for parking lots, another for athletic fields, and so on. 
Figure 17.9 shows grading criteria that would be used to create the inside slope 
of a pond.
F i g u r e   1 7 . 9    An example of grading criteria typically used for the inside slope of a pond
Understanding Grading Groups
A grading group is a named collection of grading objects that enables you to 
perform certain important functions with multiple grading objects simultane-
ously. For example, you can create a surface from a grading group or calculate 
cut and fill values by comparing a grading group to a surface in the drawing.
Understanding Grading Objects and Sites
Like feature lines, grading objects must exist in a Civil 3D site. When two or 
more grading objects occupy the same site, there is potential for them to inter-
act. There is also the potential for grading objects to interact with other feature 
lines in the same site. This interaction can benefit some designs, but there are 

 
Cr e at i n g G r a d i n g O b j e c t s	
3 5 5
cases where this interaction will cause the design to be incorrect. Therefore, it’s 
important to proactively manage sites while you’re working with grading objects 
and feature lines.
Creating Grading Objects
You begin creating a grading object by launching the Grading Creation Tools 
command. This opens the Grading Creation Tools toolbar (see Figure 17.10), 
which is similar to the Alignment Layout Tools and the Network Layout Tools 
toolbars that you used in previous chapters. Like those toolbars, the Grading 
Creation Tools toolbar provides the commands to configure your design, create 
new design objects, and edit those objects.

Exercise 17.4: Create Grading Objects
In this exercise, you’ll build a pond using grading objects.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Creating Grading Objects.dwg located in 
the Chapter 17 class data folder. 
The drawing is zoomed in to the proposed location of a stormwater 
detention pond. You’ll use grading objects to build a model of the 
pond, starting with the green feature line that represents the top 
inside edge of the pond.
I Thought Detention Was a Bad Thing
The pond you design in this exercise is referred to as a detention pond. Its func-
tion is to slow the release of stormwater to the same rate that existed prior to 
development. When it rains, runoff is collected by the inlets and conveyed to 
the pond through underground pipes. The pond outlet is restricted to reduce 
the flow of water. This causes the water to back up, hence the need for a pond 
to detain it. After the storm is over, the water will stay in the pond for a bit until 
it empties out.

What’s the reason for all this? Before grass, soil, and forest were replaced with 
pavement, runoff water was released from this area of land at a relatively slow 
rate. Now, less of the water is being absorbed, and it’s traveling much faster 
along the pavement and concrete that carries it. This increase in flow and velocity 
causes erosion damage and must be mitigated. A common way to accomplish 
this mitigation is by including a pond in your design.

Editing Grading Objects
Because of the dynamic nature of grading objects, any edits to a feature line 
that serves as a grading-object baseline will automatically trigger an update of 
the grading object. This makes most grading-object editing fairly easy. In addi-
tion, there are two tools you can use to edit the criteria that were used to create 
the grading object: Grading Editor and Edit Grading. The Grading Editor com-
mand opens Panorama, enabling you to edit the criteria in a table format. The 
Edit Grading command is a command-line interface.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand feature lines and grading objects. 
You’re able to create feature lines from objects in the drawing or by drawing them from scratch. 
You can edit feature-line geometry and elevations using the appropriate tools. You also can 
create and modify grading objects to design specific terrain shapes.
You’re ready to begin performing grading design in a production environment.

Chapter 18
Analyzing, 
Displaying, and 
Annotating Surfaces
In Chapter 17, “Designing New Terrain,” you experienced a few examples 
of using the AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software to design new terrain in the form 
of lot grading and pond design. With more time, you would have completed 
the shaping of all the lots, resulting in a grading design for the entire proj-
ect. Now that all the major grading design components are complete (roads, 
lots, and a pond in this example), it’s time to combine them into one com-
plete design. Once you have done this, you can analyze the design to ensure 
that it meets several additional design and construction requirements. This 
analysis may result in the need for an adjustment to the design, at which 
time you’ll begin an iterative process: design, analyze, adjust, design, ana-
lyze, adjust, and so on. You’ll repeat this cycle until the design is the best 
that time and resources permit. When the design is optimized, you can then 
provide annotation that provides the necessary information for the contrac-
tor to build your design for the land’s new shape.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
▶
▶Combine design surfaces
▶
▶Analyze design surfaces
▶
▶Calculate earthwork volumes
▶
▶Label design surfaces

Combining Design Surfaces
In Chapter 17, you created a pond design that resulted in a surface represent-
ing the shape of the pond. You also performed some lot grading, and if you had 
continued working on the lot grading for a few hours, you eventually would have 
finished all the lots, creating a surface that covered nearly the entire project. 
In Chapter 9, “Designing in 3D Using Corridors,” you created a corridor surface 
to represent the model of the roads. This approach of designing the shape of 
the terrain in parts is common and recommended. For even the most talented 
designer, it’s difficult to design all aspects of a project at once. It’s easier, and 
often more efficient, to divide the design into “mini-designs” such as the road, 
lots, and pond that you experienced for yourself.
Once the parts are in place, it’s then time to combine them into one master sur-
face. To accomplish this, you use a simple but very powerful capability of surfaces in 
Civil 3D: pasting. Just as you’re able to paste a paragraph of text into a document, you 
can paste one surface into another. The similarities between surfaces and documents 
end there, however. For example, when you paste one surface into another, the  
pasted version is a live copy of the original, meaning if the original is modified,  
the pasted version is also modified. To find the command to paste surfaces, right-click 
Edits in a surface in Prospector or choose the Surfaces ribbon tab (see Figure 18.1).

When you’re working with multiple pasted surfaces, you can use the order 
in which they are pasted to achieve a desired result. The way this works is 
that when two overlapping surfaces are pasted, the second one overwrites the 
first in the area where they overlap. You can control the order in which sur-
faces are pasted on the Definition tab of the Surface Properties dialog box (see 
Figure 18.2). Here you can rearrange the order of operations not just for pasting 
surfaces but for other operations as well.

Exercise 18.1: Combine Surfaces
In this exercise, you’ll create an FG Final surface by combining surfaces 
representing lot grading, road elevations, pond grading, and a small area of 
daylighting.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Combining Surfaces.dwg located in the 
Chapter 18 class data folder. 
In this drawing, the lot grading design is complete, as shown by 
the blue, red, and green feature lines. There is also a small area 
between lots 73 and 76 where a grading group was used to calculate 
daylighting.
	
2.	 In Prospector, expand Surfaces, and note the surfaces that are listed. 
Right-click Surfaces, and select Create Surface. 
	
3.	 On the Create Surface dialog, enter FG Final in the Name field, and 
select Contours 1' and 5' (Design) (Contours 0.5m and 2.5m (Design)) 
as the style. Click OK. 
The new FG Final surface is listed in Prospector.

In the road areas, the contours you saw in step 5 are replaced with 
contours that accurately represent the road elevations. In the 3D 
model, the roads are accurately represented, and if you zoom in, you 
can see the curb and the crown of the road clearly. The interior lot 
area is empty because this area has a hide boundary applied to it in 
the Road FG surface.

Modular Design
In the preceding exercise, you saw five design surfaces listed in Prospector, each 
representing its own mini-design. The origin of these surfaces is as follows:
Lots – Exterior    This surface is created from the feature lines used to grade 
all the lots except those enclosed between Jordan Court, Madison Lane, and Logan 
Court. The feature lines were added to the Lots – Exterior surface as breaklines. 
A polyline was drawn along the back edges of the lots and added to the surface 
as an outer boundary. The surface was allowed to triangulate across the road and 
interior lot areas. The following image shows the Lots – Exterior surface in 3D.
Lots – Interior    This surface is created from the feature lines used to grade 
all the lots enclosed between Jordan Court, Madison Lane, and Logan Court. The 
feature lines were added to the surface as breaklines. A polyline was drawn along 
the front edges of the lots and added to the surface as an outer boundary. The 
surface was allowed to triangulate across the pond area. The following image 
shows the Lots – Interior surface in 3D.

features available in Civil 3D. I’ve grouped these features into three categories: 
surface analysis, hydrology tools, and quick profiles.
Using Surface Analysis
In the context of this category, surface analysis refers to the functions that 
appear on the Analysis tab of the Surface Properties dialog box. Here you can 
perform detailed analyses relating to elevations, slopes, contours, and water-
sheds (see Figure 18.5). The results of an analysis are shown graphically in the 
drawing and, depending on the type of analysis, can appear as shaded areas, 
arrows, contours lines, or even 3D areas—all color-coded for the identification 
of different ranges of data. In addition, you can create a legend to help convey 
the meaning of each color.
F i g u r e   1 8 . 5    The Analysis Type choices available on the Analysis tab of the Surface 
Properties dialog box
Performing an analysis can be thought of as a two-step process. The first step 
is to create the analysis ranges in the Surface Properties dialog box. This step 
doesn’t produce anything visible in the drawing, but it creates the data that will 
be used to generate graphical output. To create something visible in the draw-
ing, you must perform the second step, which is to assign a style to the surface 
that displays the components of that analysis. For example, to display the slope 
arrows for a surface, you must first create the slope ranges and then apply a sur-
face style that has slope arrow display turned on.
Exercise 18.2: Analyze Surfaces
In this exercise, you’ll perform a slope analysis to identify steep slope areas in 
the project. You’ll then adjust one of the lots to demonstrate how an analysis 
can be used as a design tool.

More about Slopes
Slopes are a significant aspect of land development design. For every project, 
certain slope ranges are targeted for specific purposes. These ranges can vary 
from project to project. 
For the example project, you’re interested in knowing where there are excessively 
flat areas (yellow, 0%–2%) because those areas could potentially have drainage 
problems. Yellow areas on building pads are OK because there will be buildings 
in those locations, but yellow areas on roads could represent drainage issues. 
Green areas (2%–10%) represent slopes that can be traveled safely on foot or 
with a vehicle. You want the entire road surface to be green, and there should 
be enough area between each building pad and the street to install a driveway.

Orange areas (10%–34%) represent places where travel isn’t possible but where 
the slopes are still stable and safe from collapse. In this project, you would expect 
the pond embankments and the backs of some of the lots to be orange. Orange 
areas on the road and entire front yards that are orange aren’t acceptable. 
Finally, red areas represent slopes that are too steep for the soil to support. 
These areas would be subject to collapse and are considered dangerous. Red 
areas must be removed.

Edit Elevations panel of the ribbon, click Raise/Lower.
	
9.	 When you’re prompted on the command line to specify an elevation 
difference, type -5 (-1.524) and press Enter. 
After a pause, the surface rebuilds, and the red area in lot 70 is 
removed. The front yard is still green, which means it’s in the slope 
range to install a driveway (see Figure 18.7).

Using Hydrology Tools
Civil 3D provides two very useful tools to help you analyze the drainage perfor-
mance of your surface: Water Drop and Catchments. The Water Drop tool shows 
you the theoretical path of a drop of rain as it flows downhill from a location 
you specify. By analyzing this path, you can determine the direction of flow and 
find low spots where water will stop flowing and begin to accumulate. A catch-
ment shows you the area that drains to a point you specify. This is helpful for 
stormwater-management design, such as determining how large an inlet open-
ing needs to be based on the size of the area contributing runoff to it.
Exercise 18.3: Analyze Hydrology
In this exercise, you’ll use the Water Drop tool to analyze the flow of runoff to 
two inlets. Then you’ll use one of the catchment tools to determine the area 
contributing runoff to that inlet.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Using Hydrology Tools.dwg located in the 
Chapter 18 class data folder. 
	
2.	 Click the Analyze tab of the ribbon, and then click Flow

would like to select the surface from a list. 
	
4.	 On the Select A Surface dialog, click EG-FG Composite, and then 
click OK. 
	
5.	 On the Water Drop dialog, click OK to close the Water Drop dialog box. 
In the left viewport, click a point in lot 29 near the road. A blue 
water-drop path is drawn from lot 29 down the curb line to the inlet 
near station 2+50 (0+080). You can see the path in the lower-right 
3D viewport as well.
	
6.	 With the Select point: prompt still active, click a point near the 
southeast corner of lot 23. 
	
7.	 Press Esc to clear the current command. On the Analyze tab 
of the ribbon, click Catchments ➢ Create Catchment From 
Surface. 
	
8.	 When prompted to specify a discharge point, in the left viewport, use 
the Center object snap to choose the center of the red circle at the 
end of the second water-drop path you created. 
If you haven’t already 
done so, download 
and install the files for

Using a Quick Profile
In Chapter 7, “Designing Vertically Using Profiles,” you learned how to create 
surface profiles using alignments and surfaces. You also learned that a profile 
is a useful tool that enables you to slice through your design and view it from a 
different perspective. Well, what if you could create a profile from a whole list of 
entities that are readily available in your drawing? You can, and the command 
that does it is called Quick Profile.
The Quick Profile command creates a temporary profile along the path of a 
line, an arc, a polyline, a parcel line, a feature line, a survey figure, or a selected 
series of points. Once you have selected the object to represent the path, you’re 
presented with a dialog box that enables you to select any surface in the drawing 
that you would like to display in the temporary profile view. If you have selected 
a 3D object such as a 3D polyline or feature line, you’re also given the option to 
represent that object as a profile.
If you modify the object you used to define the path of the profile, the quick 
profile view updates automatically. This is a great tool for viewing slices of your 
design at many different locations very efficiently. Quick profiles are intended to 
be temporary, and they disappear whenever you save the drawing.
Exercise 18.4: Analyze Using a Quick Profile
In this exercise, you’ll use quick profiles to study the interaction between exist-
ing ground and proposed ground in the pond area and in the area between the 
interior lots.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Using a Quick Profile.dwg located in the 
Chapter 18 class data folder. 
In this drawing, a heavy red polyline in the left viewport crosses 
through the entire project at the location of the pond.

A new profile view shows existing ground in red and proposed 
ground in black. As you study the profile, you should be able to iden-
tify the shape of the road in two locations and the shape of the pond 
in between (see Figure 18.8).

Calculating Earthwork Volumes
Moving earth is one of the most expensive construction activities in a land 
development project. For this reason, there are two important questions you’ll 
need to answer about nearly every grading design you do:
▶
▶How much earth must be moved?
▶
▶How much earth must be brought to or transported away from the 
project site?
As a designer or an engineer, one of your most important tasks is to answer 
these questions with the smallest values possible. The less soil that is required 
to be moved for a project, the more money you save the client and/or owner. 
Transporting soil to or from the site is also a very costly construction activity, so 
it’s also one you should minimize.

 
C a l c u l at i n g E ar t hw o r k Vo lu m e s	
3 7 7
Understanding Earthwork Volumes
When talking about earthmoving, you’ll often use the terms cut and fill. Cut 
is soil material that is removed from the ground, and fill is soil material that 
is added to it. When an excavator takes a scoop of soil out of the ground, that 
soil is called cut. When that scoop is carried to another location on the site and 
dumped, the soil becomes fill. Grading the site is nothing more than a complex 
series of scoops and dumps—that is, cuts and fills. At the end of the project, 
all the scoops added together represent the cut value, and all the dumps added 
together represent the fill value. If these values are equal, then no soil needs to 
be transported to or from the site, thus reducing the cost of construction (not to 
mention the environmental impact). When cut and fill are equal, the condition 
is referred to as a balanced site. As a designer, you should strive to balance the 
earthwork of your designs whenever possible.
Using the Volumes Dashboard
Although you can use several methods to calculate earthwork volumes in Civil 
3D, I’ll cover only one of them in this book in detail: the Volumes Dashboard. 
The Volumes Dashboard command is found on the Analyze tab of the ribbon. 
Clicking this opens Panorama, which displays the Volumes Dashboard tab. 
Here, you can add or create one or more TIN volume surfaces and the cut and 
fill results are shown. You can also create bounded volumes, which are smaller 
areas within a volume surface that might represent individual lots or project 
phases. You can even generate detailed reports that are displayed in a browser or 
in Civil 3D, as shown in Figure 18.10.

Exercise 18.5: Analyze Earthwork
In this exercise, you’ll use the Volumes Dashboard to analyze the cut and fill for 
the entire project as well as three individual lots.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Calculating Volumes.dwg located in the 
Chapter 18 class data folder.
	
2.	 Click the Analyze tab of the ribbon, and then click Volumes 
Dashboard.
	
3.	 On the Volumes Dashboard tab of Panorama, click Create New 
Volume Surface. In the Create Volume Surface dialog box, do the 
following:
	
a.	 For Name, enter Earthwork.
	
b.	 For Style, select _No Display.
	
c.	 For Base Surface, select EG.
	
d.	 For Comparison Surface, select FG Final.
	
e.	 Click OK.
What’s a TIN Volume Surface?
As you may recall from Chapter 4, “Modeling the Existing Terrain Using Surfaces,” 
the acronym TIN stands for Triangular Irregular Network, which is a method of 
creating surfaces by drawing lines between 3D points to form triangles. A TIN 
surface is any surface that is created using this method. When you create a TIN 
volume surface, Civil 3D superimposes one TIN surface over another and creates 
a point at each location where the triangle edges cross. New triangles are then 
created by connecting the calculated points. The resulting surface has the same 
distinctive triangular shapes, but instead of elevations, the values it represents 
are differences in elevation between the two surfaces. These differences in eleva-
tion are referred to as cut when they are negative and fill when they are positive.
The cut and fill results are shown in Panorama. Here, you see that 
the Cut Volume value is much smaller than the Fill Volume value. 
The project isn’t balanced, and the requirement for extra fill means

soil will have to be delivered to the project site. The design should be 
adjusted to bring it closer to balance. This can be accomplished by 
lowering the profiles and building pad feature lines to create more 
cut while eliminating the need for fill.
	
4.	 Click Earthwork, and then click Add Bounded Volume. When you’re 
prompted to select a bounding object, click the parcel area label of lot 1. 
	
5.	 Repeat the previous step for lots 2 and 3. Click the plus sign next to 
Earthwork to expand the information below it. 
Other Volume Methods
Civil 3D provides three additional methods for calculating cut and fill:
TIN Volume Surface    You can create a TIN volume surface without using the 
Volumes Dashboard by simply using the Create Surface command and choosing 
TIN Volume Surface as the type. You can view the volume results for the surface 
by opening Surface Properties and clicking the Statistics tab.
Grading Volume Tools    You use the Grading Volume Tools with grading 
groups that have been assigned a volume base surface. Not only can the Grading 
Volume Tools report cut and fill, but they can also be used to adjust the design 
and even balance the design automatically.
Quantity Takeoff Criteria    You use Quantity Takeoff Criteria to gener-
ate section-by-section volume calculations based on a sample line group. This 
method is nearly always associated with a corridor model for a transportation 
design project.

Labeling Design Surfaces
As you have done with every other type of design in this book, you need to anno-
tate your surface design. As with all annotation, the information you convey here 
is almost as important as the design itself, particularly with regard to grading.
From a strictly documentation standpoint, the primary final product of a 
grading design is a set of design contours. By themselves, the contours aren’t 
very useful for construction. Once they are labeled, however, they begin to 
show the contractor exactly how to shape the land to meet its desired func-
tion. In some areas, contours alone don’t provide enough detail and must be 
supplemented with labels that call out specific elevations and slopes. Labels 
that refer to the elevation of a single point on a drawing are often referred to 
as spot elevations or spot grades.
Although it was some time ago, you learned how to create contour, spot, and 
slope labels in Chapter 4. You’ll apply those skills once again, but this time you’ll 
label proposed elevations rather than existing elevations.
Exercise 18.6: Label a Design Surface
In this exercise, you’ll create contour, spot elevation, and slope labels for lot 2. 
You’ll use these labels to adjust the design of lot 2.
	
1.	 Open the drawing named Labeling Design Surfaces.dwg located in 
the Chapter 18 class data folder. 
	 2.	 Click the Annotate tab of the ribbon, and then click Add Labels.
	 3.	 In the Add Labels dialog box, do the following:
	
a.	 For Feature, select Surface.
	
b.	 For Label Type, select Contour – Multiple.
	
c.	 Click Add.
	
4.	 When you’re prompted to select a surface, click one of the red or blue 
contours in the drawing. 
	
5.	 When prompted to specify the first point, pick two points that draw a 
line through the contours in the front yard of lot 2 (see Figure 18.11).

The New Way to Build
Although contours are the most common final product of a design surface, 
there are other ways your grading design can be used. One in particular is 
becoming more popular every day: a machine model. Contractors are now able 
to use GPS-guided excavation machines that can synchronize their operation 
with a computer-generated model representing the design of a project. Where 
does this model come from? You guessed it: Civil 3D and other programs like it. 
Although the contractor will often have your model checked and reworked before 
uploading it to a machine in the field, it all starts with your grading design in 
Civil 3D. A well-defined, accurate, finished ground surface translates directly to 
a well-built, well-functioning project.

Now You Know
Now that you have completed this chapter, you understand the concept of building your grading 
design in parts, and you know how to combine those parts by pasting surfaces. You’re able to 
analyze surfaces and use the results to make changes to your design. You have practiced the 
application of slope, hydrology, and earthwork analyses and can apply those on projects of 
your own. Finally, you can label your design surface, not only to provide information to people 
viewing the drawings, but also as a tool to identify design issues and correct them.
You’re ready to begin compiling, analyzing, and labeling design surfaces in a production 
environment.
