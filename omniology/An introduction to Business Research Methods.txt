Introduction
1.2.1	
Research methods as an area to study 
As a student of Business Research Methods, you will be wearing two hats. One hat or role is that of a 
student who wishes to pass exams in this area, so you will need to learn enough about research methods 
to write an assignment of appropriate standard and/or to pass the examination. This is your academic role, 
and this means we must look at research methods from an academic point of view. All academic work, 
as you already know, must take account of published literature (textbooks, journal articles, professional 
articles, relevant website information, company literature etc). So we will be looking at research methods 
literature, in order that you can use it to help you understand the chapters, and use the literature in your 
assessment. You may continue your studies and do further academic work at a higher level; again you 
will need to use research methods ideas and theories from the literature directly in that study.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
But there is another hat, that of manager, research consultant or practitioner, for which this short book 
aims to prepare you. Sometimes, your academic assignments may require you to step into the role of 
consultant. So sometimes in this book, you will need to imagine yourself in the role of manager or 
consultant, needing to answer questions in real-time, carry out research to answer vital questions for 
the business you are in.
Most of you reading this book may not wind up as researchers in an organization or ever have the title 
of “researcher”, but in fact, as a manager or a professional in an organization, you will be expected to 
operate in a logical and scientific manner. Most of the research that is being done in an organization is 
not in the Research and Development department. In fact, it’s done throughout the organization.
As an accredited professional in an organization, particularly one with a university or graduate education, 
you will be expected to work with sound research-oriented skills. In most organizations, the responsibility 
for thinking in a systematic and logical manner is everyone’s responsibility, rather than being concentrated 
in just one function of the business or just being “management’s responsibility”.
Take a moment to think through the differences between these research roles, between your academic 
hat and your business hat.
1.2.2	
Research methods versus research methodology
Many authors use these terms interchangeably, but there is a correct way of using them. As students of 
“Research Methods”, we must know the difference. What is it? Textbooks treat this in varying ways but 
research “methods” usually refers to specific activities designed to generate data (e.g. questionnaires, 
interviews, focus groups, observation) and research “methodology” is more about your attitude to and 
your understanding of research and the strategy or approach you choose to answer research questions. 
This chapter will start with a good look at research methodology, and then will go on to look at 
research methods.
1.3	
The nature of business research
If you have ever used the phrase “research shows that…” in an assignment or conversation, you will 
not be doing this again! Understanding Research Methods helps us to be specific about the research 
we discuss, and to make sure that research comes from a valid source and was collected and analysed 
appropriately. Many surveys are conducted every day throughout the world to prove a particular point, 
to support an ideological argument, or just to sound authoritative. We hear them and see them in the 
news media all the time. Some of this “research” is a “vox pop” where someone, often a journalist, has 
asked a few people in the street their view of a Government policy, or a product or service, or a current 
crisis. This is quite different from the kind of business research we are discussing on this chapter.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
In business, and for academic research, the questions we ask must be valid and fair, relating directly to 
our need for information, in other words our research must have a clear objective purpose, we are not 
collecting information for its own sake. 
We must also collect that information (data) in a fair and systematic way. For example, we should 
think about who we ask for information, and how they will understand our questions. If we cannot ask 
everyone involved, then we must be able to justify why we ask only a certain section of that population. 
We must also analyse our data with great care in a systematic way. The rigour of our analysis will have 
a major effect on whether our research results are valid or not. If we are trying to determine which of 
a range of new technologies to invest in, then it will be very important that we don’t skew our results 
towards a technology or application created by someone we know, or that we don’t miss out certain 
relevant technologies, as these inaccuracies will lead to a poor investment decision. 
1.3.1	
What might be special about business research?
If we contrast research in business with, for example, research into chemistry, one particular issue is clear: 
business research is not a single pure academic discipline like chemistry. If we conduct research in the 
field of chemistry, we will certainly have to know a lot about chemical concepts, the laws of chemistry 
and the history of scientific development in chemistry as well as the context of current chemical research. 
There will be much to learn about the field before we could become successful researchers in that field, 
contributing to new knowledge. 
However, in business the issues are not so narrowly focused. We will need to understand things about a 
range of stakeholders; for example, managers, staff, customers and owners, about business entities such as 
companies and partnerships and co-operatives, about economies and how they affect business operations, 
about products and services and how they vary over time, how they can be produced efficiently, about 
money and what regulates its availability, how it produces profit, and Governments and how their policy 
affects business operations, customers’ income and needs etc. 
We can see that business is an umbrella term for many different things, and involves a number of different 
academic disciplines, such as mathematics, psychology, sociology, physics, economics, politics, history 
and language. So when we research into business or management, we will be drawing on a number of 
different disciplines and domains. Business research is multi-disciplinary.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Business research can also be conducted at different levels. We may want to find a way to predict when a 
particular project might move to the next stage of the product life cycle. This could involve a substantial 
piece of work involving customers, competitors and markets as well as product strategies for resource 
use, marketing and sales. We could try some trend analysis and aim to forecast future growth or decline 
in sales of our product against the competition, we could do some desk research into government policy 
affecting this market, we could interview experienced managers in the field to find out their subjective 
views about the product’s predicted life. This is a complex piece of research, since there are so many 
variables and stakeholders involved in influencing a product’s life cycle. 
Alternatively, we may want to find out how sales have changed over a period of five years. This will 
involve “fact finding”, and may be simple to collect from financial statements, and be expressed in a 
clear chart showing sales figures over time. Easy. But what if there were major changes to products or 
services during that time? Or a move of premises which caused a slump in sales during a short period? 
Or a re-branding exercise? We would have to decide what depth or what level to use for our research, 
and for this we would need to know its purpose. 
You might be thinking that this sounds a bit complicated. After all, not every manager or employee has 
studied business research methods, yet they still have to make decisions affecting the business on the 
basis of what they find out. Fair point. Millions of business decisions are made daily across the world 
without detailed research. What we are trying to do by studying Business Research Methods is to give 
you the choice to do the research systematically and rigorously. That way, your decisions will improve, 
and you won’t be tempted to go with the first option, which may not be the best one.
Does this mean a lot of theory? Not necessarily a lot, but some will be helpful, in order to interpret the 
“facts” that we find. Usually business research will be conducted to achieve a practical outcome, and 
that practical outcome will be best understood in a context. A theoretical context, for example industrial 
sociology, or economics, may help us to analyse a situation more effectively and critically. It may even 
help us to challenge or move that theory forward. While this book is not about critical thinking skills, 
it should be clear to you that that is a fundamental skill to learn in your studies. It does not mean being 
“critical” in a negative sense. It means asking searching questions to challenge the assumptions people 
make, looking not just for what is said but also for what is not said and considering the reasoning behind 
conclusions drawn. For a good presentation further expanding on critical thinking, watch the following 
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oefmPtsV_w4
Bryman and Bell (2011) discuss the distinction between “grand theory” i.e. a theory dealing with abstract 
ideas and/or relationships between factors and “middle range” theory which deals with a more limited 
context (2011). Additionally, Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2012) provide a summary of some research 
on “what theory is not”.

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
1.3.2	
Modes of knowledge 
One way of thinking about the knowledge that is created through business research is provided by Gibbons 
et al (1994). These researchers talked about “Mode 1 knowledge” as that which is created by academics 
for an academic intellectual purpose, to further and add to what is known. This has to do with basic 
research and tends to be built on the foundations of what was known before, just as in any academic 
essay, you must discuss what is known (published) before you start to do your own research or consider 
how that knowledge might be further discussed or developed. Who wants Mode 1 knowledge? Usually 
other academics. An example of Mode 1 business knowledge could be: the concept of economies of scale. 
The researchers distinguish this from “Mode 2 knowledge”, which is practical applied knowledge and 
comes from collaborating with practitioners or policy makers, for example managers in organizations. 
Who wants Mode 2 knowledge? People making business decisions or developing policy as well as 
academics interested in applied research. This kind of knowledge is much more dependent on an 
understanding of context because it is essentially “real world” knowledge. It is no use knowing that 
generally there are economies of scale if your business has overstretched itself by investing in a larger 
factory and profit has reduced as a result. An example of relevant Mode 2 knowledge here would be: 
how to calculate depreciation on capital investment with a particular country’s accounting standards and 
how this might be used in conjunction with business strategy objectives for expansion. 
Huff and Huff (2001) also suggest a third mode of knowledge. “Mode 3 knowledge”. This is k nowledge, 
which is neither produced specifically for academic purposes nor for direct application to practical 
need, but for understanding the bigger picture in relation to society’s survival and the “common good”. 
An example of Mode 3 knowledge might be: the impact of capitalism on developing countries in the 
African continent. This kind of information does not have specific immediate practical value (and would 
not find a business sponsor), and it may not result from academic enquiry, yet it could be of profound 
importance to international economic and social policy and business organizations in Africa. 
Have a look on the web, use Google Scholar or another academic database or search engine, to find an 
example of business research and then classify it into Mode 1, 2 or 3 knowledge. 
1.4	
What kind of business problems might need a research study?
Most work in business organizations, in whatever sector or ownership, will require research activities. 
We have already discussed the idea that business research in the context of this course is likely to involve 
some theory or concept as well as purely practical questions such as “how does the product range compare 
in terms of contribution to profit?” Or “which method of training has produced more output – coaching 
or a group training course?”

15 
Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Both these questions have potential for theory application as well as simple numerical survey, but some 
research problems are more obviously underpinned by theoretical ideas. For example, those which seek to 
generalize or to compare one organization with another: “what are the most effective ways of introducing 
a new employee to the organization?” or “how do marketing strategies differ in the aerospace industry?” 
When choosing an area for research, we usually start either with a broad area of management, which 
particularly interests us e.g. marketing or operations management, or we start with a very practical 
question like those in the last paragraph, which need answers to help with managerial decision-making. 
Refining from this point to a researchable question or objective is not easy. We need to do a number 
of things: 
•	 Narrow down the study topic to one which we are both interested in and have the time to 
investigate thoroughly 
•	 Choose a topic context where we can find some access to practitioners if possible; either a 
direct connection with an organization or professional body, or a context which is well 
•	 documented either on the web or in the literature 
•	 Identify relevant theory or domains of knowledge around the question for reading and 
background understanding.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
•	 Write and re-write the question or working title, checking thoroughly the implications of 
each phrase or word to check assumptions and ensure we really mean what we write. This is 
often best done with other people to help us check assumptions and see the topic more clearly. 
•	 Use the published literature and discussion with others to help us narrow down firmly to an 
angle or gap in the business literature, which will be worthwhile to explore. 
•	 Identify the possible outcomes from this research topic, both theoretical and practical. If they 
are not clear, can we refine the topic so that they become clear? (For example, ask yourself the 
question, if I find an answer, then what use is it?)
1.5	
What are the key issues in research methods we need to understand?
1.5.1	
Research is a messy activity! 
Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2012) provide a flow diagram of the research process. This helps us to 
see the process as a logical progression, which has certain stages, and this process would apply whether 
your research is for an academic purpose or a business purpose. However, this model could give a rather 
misleading impression, as the authors mention. Let’s take just two of the early stages: formulating the 
research topic and critically reviewing the literature.
Formulating the research topic, as we have seen above in the previous section, can take quite a time. 
We start with a broad idea of an issue or area for research such as the impact of flexible working on an 
organization , and this goes through many iterations before it turns into a working title and clear set of 
research questions. Often the working title does not get finalised until very near the end of the research, 
when the process and outcomes are clearer, but because this is the first thing which appears in the process, 
it can seem, often wrongly, to be a first stage. At best, the first stage is a tentative idea, sometimes a leap 
in the dark, an idea we want to test out. All it needs to do at this stage is give us a direction for research 
and some ideas about what to read and where to look for information. Much later, the research topic 
will be the label given to the completed research and will be how others navigate their way to our work, 
so by then it must be clear and precise. 
Critically reviewing the literature – this stage seems to come early on in the research, and that is how it 
should be, since we must read what is published on a topic before we can begin to formulate clear ideas 
about how to proceed with primary research and which questions still need answers. However there 
is no one set time period in which we read the literature. We read as early as possible to get an idea of 
what is published, but we must keep on reading throughout the research as new items may be published 
in the area, and the primary research may lead us to form new questions of the literature, which involve 
new literature searches. 
However, when we write up the research, it is likely that the literature review will appear to be an early 
and separate stage in the research process. In reality, it is iterative and “messier” than this.

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
1.5.2	
The researcher affects the results of research. 
Researchers try very hard to be objective and balanced in their enquiries and their writing. However 
there is no such thing as totally impersonal objective research. Imagine a scientific model, which sets 
out a hypothesis or a contention such as “H1: this new computer keyboard will improve typing speeds” 
and then seeks evidence to prove or disprove the hypothesis, (this is usually referred to as deductive 
research). This could be considered the closest to “objectivity”, especially when it is possible to experiment 
on one group and have a “control” group of similar subjects for comparison. For our hypothesis, we 
could divide all the keyboard users in our organization into two groups, time their typing speeds on 
the old keyboard on a particular task and then, from the speeds produced, set up two groups, each of 
which had a similar profile of typing speeds. Then we give a new task at the same time to each group, 
giving one group the new keyboard. Measure the results to test the hypothesis.
This sounds pretty objective. 
So in what way could we say that we, as the researchers, will influence the results?
Because researchers are people, not machines, not only will their method of research affect their results, 
but their values will also affect results. The researcher’s mindset and personal values and experience 
will provide a filter for which method they use and what they see in the research results. This is often 
a consequence of the classic functional design model, where employees with similar disciplines (e.g. 
marketing, accounting, operations etc.) are grouped together for administrative purposes. An unintended 
consequence of this is “groupthink” (Janis 1983). When an employee wears her “researcher hat”, regardless 
of their discipline, they try to set aside as much as possible their internal bias and opinions. 
Malcolm Gladwell (2000, 2005, 2008) helps readers to understand how we often make quick decisions 
based upon subconscious processes working within our own minds. His words will help you see the 
world differently and explain bias in everyday decision making.
In our example about keyboard speeds above, can you see any possibility of bias in the research method? 
Can you see any assumptions or values? Can you see any ways in which we might look for particular 
results to confirm what we think? 
Just to illustrate this idea a little further, imagine a company in which profit levels are falling. The finance 
director may see a financial problem here and will research sales and cost trend data, looking for that 
financial problem. The marketing director will look for problems in the marketing strategy, or more 
likely the way other people in the business have prevented the marketing strategy from being carried 
out effectively. The non-executive director may see an industry trend as the problem, and will research 
professional literature to support his or her idea. Each is likely to find the problem they look for, and 
they may all be right to some extent.

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
In business research, we must try our hardest to look for possible bias in both how we conduct the research 
and in what we think we have found. But since we cannot eradicate all bias, we must also be explicit 
about the perspective which may colour our research, so that readers of our results can understand we 
do not find “the truth”, just one version of that truth in a particular context. 
1.5.3	
The difference between qualitative and quantitative research
As we move through this book, we will be looking at a wide range of ways to approach business research, 
especially in the third chapter when we look at research designs. For now, it is simply important to 
distinguish two major approaches: qualitative and quantitative. Of course, by now in your studies, you 
will have noticed that nothing is really “simple” in academic work! So in order to talk sensibly about 
qualitative and quantitative approaches we also have to introduce a few other ideas.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Deductive versus Inductive 
As mentioned above, a deductive approach begins by looking at theory, produces hypotheses from that 
theory, which relate to the focus of research, and then proceeds to test that theory. But that is not the 
only way to use theory in research. An inductive approach starts by looking at the focus of research (the 
organization, a business problem, an economic issue etc.) and through investigation by various research 
methods, aims to generate theory from the research. A simple way to put it would be: deductive reasoning 
moves from the general to the specific and inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. For 
deductive reasoning to work, we need to have confidence in the general premise, or theory, on which it 
is based. For inductive reasoning to work, we need to make careful observations of the specific situation 
and to consider possible causal links in that situation in order to produce a reliable idea or theory which 
relates to other situations too. For a good presentation further expanding on inductive and deductive 
reasoning, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBxE0y7b464
Divergent and Convergent thinking
Inductive reasoning requires divergent thinking. However people are better at convergent thinking. In 
the diagram below, try to connect all nine dots with four straight unbroken lines.
Figure 1 Nine dots puzzle
Divergent thinking solves the nine dot puzzle. See below. You have to think “outside the box” for the 
solution. This is helpful in the problem identification or “problematisation” phase of research.

Figure 2 Nine dots solution
In school, we are often taught not to “colour outside the lines”. Even answers to the most perplexing 
problems, requiring rigorous research, are often out there in the fringe of our perception. That’s what 
makes solving them so tricky. Once we have identified the underlying problem, having engaged in a 
creative and divergent process, allowing lots of answers and problems to be generally possible, then it’s 
time to move to a more convergent or evaluative thinking model to complete the research and look for 
the solution.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Failure to explore the problem thoroughly at the start regularly happens in business. Time pressures, boss 
pressures, customer pressures all force people to act quickly without thinking things through. As a researcher, 
you need to resist the urge to jump to a conclusion; aim to explore the problem creatively, widening out the 
possible ways forward, before you use convergent and evaluative research approaches to reach a solution.
Positivist versus Interpretivist
A positivist approach is usually associated with natural science research and involves empirical testing. 
Positivism states that only phenomena which we can know through our senses (sight, smell, hearing, 
touch, taste) can really produce “knowledge”. It promotes the idea of experimentation and testing to prove 
or disprove hypotheses (deductive) and then generates new theory by putting facts together to generate 
“laws” or principles (inductive). Positivists suggest that this kind of research can be “value free” (but 
see our discussion on bias above). Finally positivist research is about objective rather than subjective 
(normative) statements and only the objective statements are seen to be the proper domain of scientists. 
You can find examples of this approach in randomized controlled trials used for testing new medicines. 
A control group is used where the new medicine is not used, or a placebo is used, and the test results of 
this group are compared with results from a group using the new medicine. This aims to find the truth 
about the new drug – did it help or didn’t it. In business research, such trials are rarely possible because 
of the difficulty of creating useful control groups, and the difficulty of narrowing down one changed 
variable (like the drug in a controlled trial).

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
We contrast this with the idea of “interpretivism”. This is much more common in the social sciences, 
in which business and management belongs. Because business and management involve people as well 
as things, the interpretivist argument promotes the idea that subjective thought and ideas are valid. 
This idea is broadly based on the work of Max Weber (1864–1920) who described sociology as a social 
science “which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action in order to arrive at a causal 
explanation of its course and effects” (1947, p. 88). An interpretivist researcher aims to see the world 
through the eyes of the people being studied, allowing them multiple perspectives of reality, rather than 
the “one reality” of positivism. 
Objectivist versus constructivist 
This is a different angle on the ideas above. Objectivism states that social entities (like organizations, 
societies, teams) have an existence, which is separate from the people in them. You will have discussed 
the company as a legal entity earlier in your studies, we know it has a legal existence. So from a legal 
point of view, objectivism is fine. Suppose now we consider the idea of a “learning organization” (Senge, 
P. M. 1990). Clearly people in organizations can learn, but to what extent could we say the organization 
itself learns? Who teaches it? Who assesses that learning? This is a big debate, but we are using this idea 
to show that an objectivist view would say there definitely is an entity (the organization) independent 
of the people in the organization which can learn and foster learning. Constructivists would say on the 
contrary that the organization has no independent reality. It is constructed in the minds of those who 
think about it. So every time we think about an organization, we are “constructing” it into some kind 
of reality. From this perspective, the organization only has an existence in the minds of people, whether 
they are the staff or managers, customers, suppliers, contractors, government, professional bodies or, of 
course, business researchers.
Quantitative versus qualitative?
So where do these different ideas take us in relation to understanding qualitative and quantitative research 
strategies? We can use the other concepts above to help us build a picture: 
A quantitative approach to research is likely to be associated with a deductive approach to testing theory, 
often using number or fact and therefore a positivist or natural science model, and an objectivist view 
of the objects studied. 
A qualitative approach to research is likely to be associated with an inductive approach to generating 
theory, often using an interpretivist model allowing the existence of multiple subjective perspectives and 
constructing knowledge rather than seeking to “find” it in “reality”.

Research problems and questions and  
how they relate to debates in Research Methods.
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
In current business and management research, you are likely to find a mix of both quantitative and 
qualitative strategies, looking at observable objective facts where they might be seen to exist, through 
the use and manipulation of numbers, and looking also at the perceptions of those involved with these 
“facts”. So in a practical sense, we try to use the best of both worlds to investigate the messy reality of 
people and organizations. Sound business research often uses both strategies in coming to valid and 
accurate conclusions for the problem solving process.
You may wish to search the web for an article in the International Journal of Social Research Methodology 
which is the transcript of an interview with the famous social anthropologist Peter Townsend (Thompson, 
P 2004). Although this is not research directly related to business, you should be looking in this article 
to find some understanding of the complexity and messiness of research, the influence of the researcher 
on the research and some of the differences between qualitative and quantitative methods. 
1.6	
Questions for self review
1.	 What is the difference between Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge and why does it matter in 
business research? 
2.	 What do you think will be the most difficult part of identifying research chapters for study 
and why? 
3.	 Do you prefer the idea of conducting quantitative or qualitative research? Is this just about 
statistics versus interview research methods? Check what each of these means in terms of what 
you believe is the nature of knowledge and what you believe about business organizations.

How does literature relate to research?
In Chapter 1 we discussed superficial research studies and the idea that theory was going to be relevant 
to good quality business research, whether or not immediate practical questions needed an answer. We 
also talked briefly about what theory was and what it was for. We identified deductive research, which 
looked first at theory and identified propositions or hypotheses, which the research was meant to confirm 
or disprove, and we found the opposite direction, inductive research which begins with the study of a 
situation and then seeks to generate theory.
Any research study, inductive or deductive, which you undertake for academic purposes, will always 
require a review of relevant literature, and that will be a “critical” review, not just a description of what 
others have said. When you are working in an organization, you may find that there is no time to conduct 
a full literature review, but this chapter will try to convince you that a clear idea of the theoretical context 
of a piece of research, helps you to clarify its purpose and outcomes, and make clear for which situations 
your findings do or do not hold. We all need to get into the habit of literature searching before working 
out how to research a particular topic.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
At the very minimum, it is desirable to search professional or industry sources of information before 
completing a research study of any kind at work. This will demonstrate your professionalism and the 
breadth of your understanding of the field. Anyone can ask a few people to fill in a questionnaire, but 
not everyone can make sense of the answers! 
Robert Sutton presents the case for using scholarly research in business in an article in Strategy and 
Leadership (2004). See if you can track down this article on the web and see what you think of his views. 
There is a strong case there for what we do when we search for and review what others have published 
in the field. Most business problems can be illuminated by finding out what others have thought before 
and then trying to apply some of their ideas – this is a natural response, as we chat with friends or 
colleagues about problems. How much better then to look for and use the extensive work researchers 
have put in on similar problems and gain the advantage of their scholarly work, provided we can put it 
into our own context. 
2.3	
what kinds of literature should we search for?
At an early stage in trying to identify a research project, any kind of literature may help us. So a Google 
search (www.google.com) or using Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com) or any other general search engine 
will help us experiment with key words until we begin to find material which is helpful. 
As soon as we get a clearer idea of what is out there, we need to identify specific kinds of literature, so 
that we can judge the relative merit of what we find for our research study. 
2.3.1	
Primary literature sources 
These are the sources, which are the least accessible, often being company literature or unpublished 
research, private correspondence and can include conference proceedings. What is their value? In some 
cases this is very valuable information, which relates directly to the research problem in which you are 
interested. For example, suppose you are researching corporate advertising to children, an area, which 
is sensitive. Much information about what companies decide, and why, will be contained in company 
documents and emails. However access to primary sources is becoming easier as the web provides an 
instant publishing medium. 
Blogs and personal websites are able to bring primary literature directly to the public, however we should 
bear in mind that in such direct personal publication, there is no vetting or monitoring process as there 
usually is in a secondary source. DO NOT confuse primary literature sources with “primary research”. 
The latter means research you have conducted yourself for a specific purpose (which produces more 
primary literature i.e. yours).

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
2.3.2	
Secondary literature sources
These sources are much more easily available in the public domain. They include published books and 
articles in journals, news media and published business, government and international body publications. 
Why are they secondary sources? Usually they reproduce in a different format what was original primary 
work. For example, a researcher will often first reveal their findings at a relevant conference and these may 
get published later in an academic journal. Similarly business consultants will report research findings 
to their clients – often the company in which or for which the research was completed – but later may 
seek permission to disseminate findings more publicly, perhaps in an anonymised or generalized form, 
in a professional journal or news report. 
Value is high but information in these publicly available media is likely to be less current than primary 
sources, due to the time it takes to check, review, authorise and publish. However, the web is making a 
huge difference here. Already many academic journals and professional publications are available full 
text on the web. In some cases, there is no time difference between primary and secondary sources. 
For academic research, peer-reviewed journals, such as the Journal of Management Studies, are considered 
more reliable sources than trade magazines or news channels, as the material will have to by monitored 
by experts in the relevant field, who are not in the business of selling publications. The process of peer 
review is usually rigorous. When someone submits a paper to an academic journal, the editor will first 
check it fits with the aims and scope of the journal, then check the content is relevant and clearly written 
and well argued. Only then does the paper normally get sent to other academics not known by the author, 
who are asked to read and review the paper and suggest improvements and whether they think it is fit 
for publication. At least two, sometimes more, such referees are approached with the paper. Only when 
they have sent in their reviews (and these are unpaid and have to be fitted in around other academic 
teaching and research so they may take some time), can the editor consider their suggestions and send 
them back to the author. Then the author has the choice to accept and modify their paper, which again 
takes some time, before resubmitting the amended paper. This process of peer review may happen two 
or three times for each paper until everyone believes the paper is fit for publication. Then it gets into 
a queue for the publisher to release, often electronically first, then on paper if it is a print journal. This 
whole process can take more than a year, which explains the time lag on published academic work and 
the serious rigour introduced by peer review.
Textbooks may also be peer-reviewed to some extent, but due to the time lag of publication, and the need 
to reach a wider readership in order to recoup the costs of publication, they tend to be less specialised 
than journal articles and possibly less current.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
It is also possible to find academic journal articles which are themselves reviews of academic literature. 
While most articles will mention and relate to studies to the published field, a published literature review 
will provide a deep and wide range critique within a particular field. Of course, the review will only be 
useful at a time close to its publication, since there will usually be additions to the field after that time 
which are not included. There is a rigorous method for undertaking such reviews, known as “systematic 
review”. A systematic review is a type of literature review which tries to find, evaluate and synthesize all 
good quality research evidence on a particular topic or research question. The review includes a thorough 
assessment of methodological quality, looking in detail at how research questions in this literature were 
connected to existing literature at the time, and how research methods were chosen and how rigorously 
they were used. All this detail is to help the reader judge the reliability and quality of the research. Such 
systematic reviews enable findings to be checked by readers as they show an audit trail of review, and 
are usually high quality scholarly works. To undertake a systematic review, we have to do a thorough 
search of the literature for relevant papers and show where and how we searched in the review itself. This 
could be listing the databases and citation indexes searched, plus journal websites and hand-searched 
individual journals and other sources. Remember that although most literature can be tracked down 
somehow on the Web, much literature is not easily found through standard search engines, and some 
will be inaccessible online (the content may be subscription only or just the abstract and citation will be 
there, or it is unpublished). This thorough search is conducted against clear criteria, determined by the 
research question. The outcome is a synthesis of known research on the question or topic and will be 
transparent and easy to follow. If there are limitations to the research review, these will be clearly stated.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Consider doing a brief search using either Google Scholar (www.scholar.google.com) or another database 
or search engine such as Emerald for a “systematic review” of an area of business literature. Read the 
abstract, or the full article if you prefer, and familiarise yourself with a good quality literature review. 
Moving from a basic Google.com search to using Google Scholar is an easy transition as they both work 
in much the same way. Google Scholar is a free, searchable database providing sources for both digital and 
hard copies of text from a variety of publishers, including books, articles, papers, theses and dissertations, 
abstracts and technical reports from business, governments, universities and academic publishers. There 
is another great reason for using Google Scholar in your literature search: it offers citations – links to 
the number of times a particular paper has been cited by others – which can help us determine the 
popularity and to some extent the quality of a paper before you even open it. Do bear in mind though 
that citations take time to appear. If the paper was published in the last year or two, it is unlikely that 
other papers will have been published citing it given the time it takes to publish after peer review.
2.3.3	
Tertiary literature sources 
These are collections of, or gateways to, secondary sources. They include encyclopaedias, dictionaries, 
citation indexes, catalogues and web-based portals, databases and journals’ contents pages. We use tertiary 
sources to track down secondary literature which is relevant to our field of study. 
Useful lists and details of primary, secondary and tertiary literature sources are given in most business 
research methods textbooks; for example (Saunders, M., Lewis, P. & Thornhill, A. 2012 pp. 66–67). 
2.4	
Effective literature searching
Most of you will have received guidance on literature searching at some point in your studies. Just in 
case you don’t remember it, or you would like a refresher, here are some tips. If you are comfortable 
with literature searching, skip this section and go to 2.5. 
Sometimes searching for academic literature is simple. You want academic information on a specific 
topic or by a particular author. You put the information into a web search engine and there it is. 
But sometimes it can seem like looking for a needle in haystack.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
For these times, consider a three stage search: 
Stage 1
1.	 First, make sure you are using appropriate search terms. Perhaps you don’t know enough about 
the topic to use the right vocabulary for searching. Or someone mentions a theory or idea, 
which means nothing to you. As a first step, just enter whatever you do know into Google or 
Wikipedia. Remember that to narrow a search engine search you need to lengthen (i.e. make 
more specific) the search string. E.g. rather than just looking for “motivation”, try more detail 
“Herzberg’s theory of motivation”. Hopefully that will bring you fewer and more relevant 
results. Using Google Scholar instead of general Google search will help to eliminate many of 
the commercial and marketing oriented “hits” which are associated with your search terms.
2.	 Are there American/UK English words and spellings to look out for? Use AND & OR to refine 
your search. Use ‘truncation’ (e.g. sociol+ to find sociology or sociological). Use ‘wild cards’ 
(e.g. p*diatrics to allow for different spellings of paediatrics or pediatrics). 
3.	 Once you have some results, scroll through and look for academic domain names in your 
results. E.g. …ac.uk or ….edu.au Such academic sites are more likely to give you reliable general 
information. There are often course outlines on the web for Higher Education courses, which 
give basic information on topics or theories. Use these academic links to find more vocabulary 
to describe your topic search. A little reading at this point will help you narrow your second 
stage search.
4.	 Alternatively, you could look in a relevant book for useful keywords and definitions. Try using 
the index!
Stage 2
5.	 Now you have better vocabulary to describe what you are looking for, try a relevant database 
or portal (tertiary literature source). Examples for business research are Emerald (www.
emeraldinsight.com good range of academic management journals, often fulltext), ABI/Inform 
Global (www.ovid.com wide range of periodicals and reports), Business Source Premier (http://
www.ebscohost.com/academic/business-source-premier again a wide range of journals but 
also useful sources such as Harvard Business Review, Academy of Management Review and 
professional journals), and the Social Sciences Citation Index (http://thomsonreuters.com/
social-sciences-citation-index/ this only has abstracts and titles but gives a wide search of what 
is currently being published in the social sciences). 
6.	 Within the portal or database, use your more specific search terms and make sure you are 
looking in the right place e.g. full text or abstract or keywords rather than journal title. 
7.	 Hopefully this search will find some useful academic articles. Read the abstracts and if they 
look appropriate, try to go to full text if available. If not available see step 9.

31 
Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
8.	 Consider downloading 3 academic articles, which relate to your chosen topic. If they are Full 
text, then scroll straight to the reference list at the end. Compare them and see which authors 
and works appear in more than one of the three lists. If you find some, you have probably 
found important academic sources on your topic. Go back to your academic database (such 
as Emerald full text) to key in these author names or titles to find good quality information 
on your topic. 
Stage 3 
9.	 Often the full text version of the articles you want is not available. It may ask you to subscribe 
or pay, or it may simply not be online as full text. In this case, print off the abstract and 
journal details of articles and take them to your library. In some cases an inter-library loan or 
a photocopy can be procured for you. 
10.	Don’t give up on important articles just because they aren’t fully online. Physically going to the 
library may lead you to other similar information which is also not online. Also books! Loans 
of articles and books can take some time so don’t leave this until the assessment deadline. 
11.	Finally, remember that searching for relevant literature is just one, quite time-consuming, stage 
of research. Leave plenty of time to do this, because much of what you find and read will not 
be useable in your final research study, but without searching and reading a wide range of 
literature, you are less likely to find the really appropriate sources that you need.

2.4.1	
How do we know when we have found enough? 
It is impossible to answer this question accurately. However, when you begin to find references to the 
same ideas and authors in several articles you have found, you should start to feel more comfortable that 
you have covered a good range of the literature for this topic. While you are still discovering yet more 
and more angles to the topic in your reading, keep on reading. 
In most academic domains there are “seminal” articles or books, which are widely cited by other authors 
in the field. These are usually important to read, preferably in the original version if you can get hold 
of them. They will be the key pieces of literature, which have shaped the thinking of researchers and 
practitioners in the field. We had an example of this in the last chapter when we discussed interpretivist 
research approaches and mentioned Weber (1947). Many writers on research methods, and sociology 
and philosophy, use his work, so although it was written many years ago, it is still widely cited. 
2.4.2	
How up to date should references be? 
As just mentioned, seminal works may go back a very long way in time. However, if we are discussing a 
relatively modern issue, for example employment protection legislation, then we need to use absolutely 
up to date references to show we understand current trends. It is not that older articles are less important, 
just that they may have been superseded in the field. Some academic journals regularly invite contributors 
to critique or respond to new articles. If you are using one of these journals (an example would be 
Interactive Learning Environments on learning technology published by Taylor and Francis), then it is 
worth reading through the response articles as they often produce valuable critiques of the main article. 
As a general rule, look for academic references within the last three years for preference, going back 
further if you cannot find enough useful material. 
If you are using professional journal or media information (e.g. in UK Financial Times or People 
Management, a professional HRM magazine) then aim to use very current material, within the last 
two years if possible. Out of date news items are rarely useful in academic work, unless you are doing 
a historical analysis.

Critical analysis of literature
2.5.1	
What does “critical” mean?
The following table is an extract from The Study Skills Handbook (Cottrell, S., 2008). You might consider 
using this when you are drafting a piece of work. Check for those parts of your writing, which do the 
things on the left, and look across to see how you can redraft them into a critical analytical style.

2.5.2	
Critiquing a published article
Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2012) discuss Mingers’ idea of four aspects of a critique (2000 pp. 225–6) 
i.e. critiques of rhetoric, tradition, authority and objectivity.
You could add a practical critique to this list, for example ask the question “How does this article or idea 
relate to a specific organization, sector or problem?” Could the findings be generalized to a particular 
context? If the author did not set out to generalize the findings or apply them to a particular context, 
then we cannot be negative about this, since it was not the author’s purpose. Yet some concepts can be 
particularly useful in delivering an insight to a practical business situation. 
For example, Herzberg’s ideas on a two factor theory of motivation (1966) could be perceived as a 
universal generalization about how we understand what motivates staff. This finding could be practically 
applied by minimising focus on dissatisfiers and maximising the focus on motivating factors. A narrower 
context might render the theory less powerful, for example a workplace where staff delivered a routine 
public service with few opportunities for intrinsic motivating factors (no career development or job 
change possibilities, no reward potential) where extrinsic dissatisfiers could be more useful in relation 
at least to staff retention.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
If you have difficulty thinking critically about something you are reading, you may wish to try applying 
the following set of questions, developed by Professor Tom Bourner (2003). 
1.	
What explicit assumptions are being made? Can they be challenged? 
2.	
What implicit/taken-for-granted assumptions are being made? Can they be challenged? 
3.	
How logical is the reasoning? 
4.	
How sound is the evidence for the assertion(s)? 
5.	
Whose interests and what interests are served by the assertions? 
6.	
What values underpin the reasoning? 
7.	
What are implications of the conclusions? 
8.	
What meaning is conveyed by the terminology employed and the language used? 
9.	
What alternative conclusions can be drawn from the evidence? 
10.	 What is being privileged and what is off-the-agenda in this discourse? 
11.	 What is the context of this discourse? From what different perspectives can the discourse be viewed?
12.	 How generalisable are the conclusions? 
Source: Bourner, T. (2003). “Assessing Reflective Learning.” Education and Training. 
Now I am going to introduce one more way of critically reviewing academic literature – it is practical 
and may save you some time in the long run. This is a method designed by UK academics Mike Wallace 
and Alison Wray and it is starting to be widely used in the UK in universities.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and 
critically reviewing relevant literature
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
It consists of first producing a synopsis of anything you read, it may be an article or a chapter of a book. 
You have to ask Five Critical Synopsis Questions of this article or chapter as follows (and, of course, 
note down your answers). 
1.	
Why am I reading this? 
2.	
What are the authors trying to do in writing this? 
3.	
What are the authors saying that’s relevant to what I want to find out? 
4.	
How convincing is what the authors are saying? 
5.	
In conclusion, what use can I make of this? 
From your answers to these questions, you can write a critical summary through the following structure: 
Title 
Introducing the text – use Question 1 to write this 
Reporting the content – use Questions 2 and 3 to write this 
Evaluating the content – use Question 4 to write this 
Drawing your conclusion – use Question 5 to write this. 
When you are producing a literature review which will compare a number of articles or chapters about 
a subject, if you have completed the synopsis questions, again you have a ready-made set of information 
with which to compare articles: 
So a comparative critical summary would take this structure: 
Title 
Introducing the text – use answers to Question 1 for all texts 
Reporting the content – use answers to Questions 2 and 3 for all texts to answer this 
(you can synthesise the answer rather than dealing with each one in turn) 
Evaluating the content – use answers to Question 4 for all texts to answer this (you 
can easily compare each text this way) 
Drawing your conclusion – use answers to Question 5 to compare how useful each of the texts is in relation to your 
research question. 
This method is quite simple in structure, but will produce really good academic critical analysis if you 
think carefully about your synopsis in the first place.
2.5.3	
Are there different ways of reading academic literature?
It is always tempting to read without writing. Reading for academic purposes, however, invariably 
means reading with a computer or mobile device to hand, or pen and paper, so that notes can be made 
during reading. 
Even just highlighting important extracts as you read can be futile if you are not going to go back over 
the highlighted text and read it again to make useful notes.

Putting the problem into context: identifying and

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
What kind of notes do you make? First it will be vital that you note down bibliographic details (the 
information you would include in a reference) if you are making notes outside the text itself (on a 
separate piece of paper, in a notebook, in a database or citation software). Always remember key details 
such as volume and issue numbers of journal articles, access dates if retrieving articles online, editors if 
you are reading a contributed chapter in a book. On top of this, we need to note responses to what you 
are reading e.g. surprise, disbelief, admiration, links to other things you have read, questions. Doing 
this helps to ensure you don’t just record a description, but that you are starting to respond critically to 
what you read. 
2.5.4	
Should I deal with each reference separately in the literature review? 
It is possible to do this, but it is not best practice. If you look at an article from a peer-reviewed academic 
journal such as Personnel Review, you will rarely find a section on the literature, which deals with each 
piece separately. Instead you find that authors summarise and synthesise ideas from the literature, listing 
references together where they all take a particular perspective, discussing them separately only when 
the difference between them is important to the article or research study. 
This means that we can start to see some stages in preparing a literature review: 
•	 General keyword search to learn about the topic area
•	 More specific search (online and in libraries) to identify high quality literature (academic and 
professional) which relates to the topic area and research questions
•	 Using really relevant and good quality articles to identify others in the field through their 
bibliographies
•	 Reading as much of what we find as possible until we are not finding new ideas Noting in a 
retrievable format not only what these articles and chapters say but their bibliographical details 
(including access dates for web material) and your critical responses to them and links with 
other literature (similarities, differences)
•	 Reviewing notes and discarding items which do not fit the research study
•	 Making new notes of the themes in the relevant literature 
•	 Writing the literature review on the basis of these themes, including appropriate referencing. 
Summarising what you have learned from the literature review relating to your research study. 
For example, what gap your primary research needs to fill, or what hypotheses you could test from the 
literature.

2.5.5	
Should I include my own opinions?
Just recording your likes and dislikes about a piece of writing is insufficient, since this just tells us about 
you, not about the piece of writing. Often universities spend some time encouraging students not to 
include their own opinions in their academic work, and this is because many students do include very 
subjective reactions to theories, models or concepts, without arguing logically for their view or supporting 
it with evidence from published literature. 
However, your opinion is important. Provided your opinion is based on evidence and logical reasoning, 
and is expressed fairly and objectively, it is valuable. You will find that the simplest place to express your 
opinions, and develop them, is either in class, if you attend a class, or online in a discussion forum about 
this topic or study. A discussion forum thrives on argument and people expressing ideas and being open 
to others’ ideas. However, your academic assignment will need careful and cautious monitoring of how 
you express your views, to ensure that you express a balanced view, having weighed up, and referenced 
where possible, both sides of an argument. 
Consider searching for an academic article, preferably a systematic review as mentioned above, on a 
business topic which interests you, follow the general search advice in these notes until you have tracked 
one down. Read and make notes on the article and then develop a 250 word critical response to the 
article, using the technique described above. This should provide you with useable notes for revision 
later, as well as good notes on the article if you are using it for an assignment.

Using Harvard referencing style
For any research of professional standard, consistent referencing of all sources of information used is 
vital. You will already have been doing this in your degree course, but at this stage in your studies you 
will be penalised if the referencing style is not correct. When you have produced your own research 
studies and published them, you will want them to be correctly referenced so that no-one uses your 
work without attributing it to you. 
The Harvard style is the most common referencing style in use in universities across the world, but 
other styles do exist. The main point about Harvard style is that it does not use footnotes, which can 
interrupt the flow of the text, and its bibliography is ordered alphabetically by author surname. Most 
in-text referencing includes simply the author surname(s) and year of publication, plus page number if a 
direct quotation is given. This means it is easy to find that reference in the surname ordered bibliography. 
The basic bibliographic style is author, year of publication, title, publisher, so even for web pages without 
clear guidance on referencing, we have to look for an author (perhaps the institution hosting the site – this 
is called a “corporate author”?), a year of publication (is there a recent revision or last updated date?), a 
title (even of the page used) and a publisher (this could also be the hosting institution). 
Managing your references and citations is an important aspect of conducting your literature search and 
it is essential in maintaining an accurate and up-to-date bibliography. In the past, this was an onerous 
task. Today, modern word-processing software (e.g. Microsoft Word) have built-in reference management 
tools. It is important to keep track of your references as you work on your literature review.
Additionally, Zotero (www.zotero.org) provides a free stand alone online system for collecting, organizing 
and maintaining your references and citations. Your academic institution may also provide you with a 
paid-for program such as Endnote. All these programs allow for easy integration into your literature 
review. They also allow you to choose from the most popular style guides – which could be Harvard 
style, or APA, Chicago, MLA or Turabian for example).

Different perspectives of knowledge and research which
underpin research design
“Whether we are considering the physical sciences, the life sciences or the social sciences, the research 
process begins with an interesting thought about the world around us. Without this there is no 
research. The interesting thought or research question is the common starting point of all research 
work in all fields of study. From this point research is always concerned with the emergence of 
theory whereby concepts and notions develop through the application of ideas, the observation of 
evidence and the evaluation of results. It is worth always keeping in mind that the final result of 
research is to add something of value to the body of theoretical knowledge.” (Remenyi, D. 2002) 
This is a great starting point, because this chapter is about how you start a research study – and the first 
step is usually a thought or an idea or an unsupported opinion. But do we really start there? Or do we 
have to take account of what is already there in our minds? For example we may have strong opinions, 
or no opinions, about reality, the world, politics, history, people etc. When that “original thought” occurs 
to us, it comes up already embedded in a context of what we already think we know about the world.

Choosing research approaches and strategies
You might like to look online for an article by Bannister (2005) which has an intriguing discussion of 
“realities” and the kinds of filters applied by people directly experiencing an event, researchers looking 
at the event through their eyes and readers of that research applying a third set of filters to reality. 
In Chapter 1 we discussed ideas about positivist and interpretivist research approaches. 
Basically this is a debate about the nature of knowledge, which is also called “epistemology”. Questions 
asked are “to what extent can we know something is true?” “does a phenomenon (e.g. gender discrimination 
at work) have an objective existence, or is it only existing in the minds of those who discuss it? Can we 
investigate it directly, or must be interpret its meaning from what people say about it? 
Then there is “ontology”. We have already begun to look at ontology through Chapter 1’s discussion of 
objectivism and constructivism. This is like epistemology but deals not with the nature of what we can 
know or reveal as “true” but with the nature of social entities such as organizations. Again the question 
is how and if they exist. We regularly refer to teams in business studies. What are teams? An objectivist 
view of a team is that it exists in itself, beyond the team members. A constructivist view of a team is 
that every time team members interact, they have a concept of team which is there in their minds and 
which can alter over time depending on how they interact, but does not have an independent reality. 
Questions like this are relevant to business research because they will affect the kind of research strategy 
we choose. A further idea which will be helpful in looking at where researchers are coming from is the 
idea of paradigm.

3.3	
Identify differing research paradigms for business
3.3.1	
What is a paradigm? 
Try web-searching for the word “paradigm”. Is it only researchers and academics who use this term? Is it 
helpful – or could you find a better word which is less academic? Kuhn (1970) describes it as a cluster of 
beliefs, which guide researchers to decide what should be studied and how results should be interpreted. 
Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill cite research by Burrell and Morgan (1979) which offers four paradigms 
for social sciences research, within which business research is just one type: 
•	 Functionalist (problem-solving and rational approach to organizations) 
•	 Interpretive (organizations only understood through perceptions of people about those 
organizations) 
•	 Radical humanist (organizations are social arrangements and research is about changing them) 
•	 Radical structuralist (organizations are a product of structural power relations, where conflict 
is inherent) 
These paradigms are held by the authors to be inconsistent and mutually exclusive with each other, 
in other words, if you hold one paradigm, you cannot also hold a different one. They therefore foster 
different research methods and focus on different areas for study. For example a functionalist paradigm 
takes a classic survey approach to issues, which are thought to have objective reality. A climate survey 
of employees would be an example, made to assess something “real” such as how employees feel about 
working in an organization, and using a questionnaire with both quantitative and qualitative questions 
to gain descriptive responses about that “reality”. 
An interpretive paradigm uses a qualitative research method such as discourse analysis, unstructured 
interviews to investigate perceptions and constructions of reality by “actors” in organizations, i.e. 
employees, managers, shareholders etc. 
A radical humanist paradigm would suggest again a qualitative method but looks not necessarily at the 
perceptions of social actors in the organization but seeks to probe a deeper level of values and social 
definitions, which underpin the organization. A relevant method would be grounded theory, which 
looks for theory through a structured method of investigation of what is said or written (inductive) and 
produces categories of idea, which can then be used to characterize, develop or change organizations. 
A radical structuralist paradigm may suggest a historical analysis of power in the organization, by 
developing case studies or seeking to symbolize transactions between actors in the organization, for 
example an analysis of employee relations over time.

Choosing research approaches and strategies
This is one attempt to pull together the ontological and epistemological debates about conducting 
social science research. It is the ontological and epistemological stance of the researcher which affect 
the methodology and specific methods they choose for their research. Does this make sense to you? 
We are talking about how you think about the world and the stuff you find in it; for example whether 
you believe in objective truth, or whether you find all things subjective. What kind of status business 
organizations have, and the policies and plans and structures and cultures they develop. As researchers 
we have to develop a clear sense of how we understand the world so that we don’t make the mistake of 
thinking everyone else thinks about it the same way. We have to learn to be as objective as possible, to 
recognize when our assumptions and philosophies may cloud our thinking and try to dispel them for 
the purposes of research. 
3.4	
Key differences between qualitative and quantitative research methods and 
how and why they may be mixed
You can have integrated paradigms as just mentioned, but you can also have a mix of qualitative data 
from a case study approach and the perspective of “grounded theory” (Glaser, B.,& Strauss, A. 1967; 
Locke, K., 2001; Strauss, A. & Corbin, J., 1998) and quantitative data from a subsequent survey. We 
will go into detail about grounded theory when we cover qualitative data analysis. For now, you should 
know that this approach is interpretive, as written and verbal data are collected and transcribed so that 
the texts can be fragmented into ideas, categories and themes by the researcher. So such a mix involves 
mixed methods as well as an integrated paradigm.

An introduction to  
Business Research Methods

Choosing research approaches and strategies
Research approaches or strategies need to be seen as related but distinct from the actual methods used 
in research. Make sure you understand what methods are; for example: experiment, interview, survey, 
case study, action research, grounded theory, ethnography, archival research. This is by no means an 
exhaustive list of research methods, but it is a useful broad range to keep in mind at this stage. 
Why should a business researcher want to mix qualitative and quantitative research methods? 
It is increasingly usual for business research to mix methods of data collection and analysis. This can 
be done by using different data collection methods which are all either quantitative or qualitative (e.g. 
web and paper survey, or interviews and focus groups) (a multi-method approach), or you can use both 
qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods (e.g. survey and interview and action 
research) (a mixed method approach). One of the reasons for this is “triangulation” where different 
methods of data collection and analysis will both enrich and confirm the picture you collect of a situation. 
Often survey results are used to map out a broad view of the research question, and to provide themes 
or areas for investigation in more depth through interview. Triangulation can also provide a check on 
findings from a particular method. 
It will also be important to decide whether research should take a point in time approach, i.e. look at a 
phenomenon (a new training course, induction process, technology, product launch) at a particular time 
from the perspectives of more than one person – this is cross-sectional research, or whether you have 
the opportunity to look at a phenomenon over a time period (for example tracking a new product from 
launch to maturity, looking at industry trends over time, or following cohorts of new employees through 
their employment over an extended period) – this is a longitudinal study. Most academic studies for 
qualifications tend to be cross-sectional as they are completed in a very limited time period. Longitudinal 
studies usually require external funding to protract the period of research. 
3.5	
Criteria of validity and reliability in the context of business research
3.5.1	
Reliability 
Another term for consistency or repeatability over time. Reliability is required of research studies. We 
must try to design research which is auditable i.e. transparent and clear so that the reader can either 
undertake the same method themselves and produce the same results, or at least the method is clear 
enough to instill confidence in the reader that the results were not fudged in any way. (Triangulation will 
help here).People not involved in studying business research will often confuse reliability with validity, 
but in fact just because something is reliable, it does not mean it is also valid. However, measurement 
and observation cannot be valid if the study is not reliable.
The concepts of participant error, participant bias, observer error and observer bias are factors which can 
affect the reliability and validity of collecting data and information in survey and experimental research.

3.5.2	
Validity 
Validity refers to the accuracy of a measurement or observation. There are three main ways of 
characterizing validity in research studies. It is important that research methods have “face validity” 
and “construct validity” and “internal validity”. Face validity means effectively that the non-researcher 
or lay person can broadly see that this is a valid method of researching this question; i.e. “on the face 
of it” it makes sense as a method. Face validity is important to encourage participation in surveys or 
interviews, as well as other experimental or research designs. We want to be able to answer the question 
“why do you want to know that?”. This is a bit like your personal credibility in the business world, which 
is influenced by your own behaviour and the extent to which it is professional.
Construct validity is a more complex idea and means that the method must actually measure what you 
think it measures. There are, for example, statistical ways of checking surveys and questionnaires to check 
that the questions are really asking what you think (factor analysis and item response theory). Construct 
validity is particularly important in questionnaires which are not administered face to face by a researcher 
but sent by post, email on done online, as there is no chance then to discuss and clarify the meaning of 
a question. Sometimes results can be invalidated because respondents have misunderstood a question 
and answered in a way which was not intended. This is also referred to as “measurement” validity. We 
can illustrate this idea by the famous IQ test which was intended to measure intelligence (IQ stands for 
Intelligence Quotient) but includes items which bias towards particular ethnic groups and educational 
norms. Or we could ask the question, do examinations test knowledge? Is their measurement validity 
strong? Or do they actually test something else, for example examination technique and memory skills? 
Internal validity relates to causality, i.e. does factor X cause factor Y to happen? It is sometimes easy to 
assume causality when in fact there is only association of two factors. For example, does strong motivation 
cause or lead to effective teamwork, or does effective teamwork lead to or cause strong motivation? In this 
case causality can work either way or may be quite independent concepts. We cannot assume causality 
either way. In business research it is easy to make assumptions about a factor (or “independent variable”) 
causing an effect (or “dependent variable). To test internal validity we have to ask the question, does 
the independent variable account completely for a change in a dependent variable, or are other factors 
affecting this outcome? Usually in business organizations, there are very few simple cause and effect 
relationships. Does a performance bonus make someone work harder? 
Other kinds of validity which are sometimes talked about include: external validity (this is more often 
called generalisability, i.e. can we generalize the results of our study to other contexts or situations?) and 
ecological validity (this relates to whether the act of researching a situation itself has an effect on that 
situation; it may be that findings from a business research study are clear within the study, but when 
applied to a different “ecology” i.e. outside the research study in “real life”, they no longer apply). This 
is discussed further in Chapter 5: Choosing samples from populations.

Choosing research approaches and strategies
3.6	
Your choice of research strategy or design
A research design is a grand plan of approach to a research topic. It takes quite a lot of work and reading, 
as well as simply understanding your views as a researcher. For a start, there will be no one right way of 
conducting business research – this will depend on a number of factors such as research topic, audience 
for the research (you, your university tutor or your company for example), time and other resources 
available to you, and the kind of study which is considered appropriate for that topic. There will also be 
other practical considerations such as access to information and people.
Suppose you wanted to investigate what shoppers thought about a particular marketing strategy associated 
with an organization. Can you stand outside its shop and ask passers-by questions? From an academic 
perspective, it is never that simple. There are ethical issues (you would need permission from the retailer 
to stand outside accosting customers), practical issues (you may cause an obstruction or even a breach of 
the peace in a public place!), sampling issues (which ones do you talk to because you will have to make 
a choice), what language will you use for your questions (relevance to the interview subject, their ability 
to understand the questions), their motivation to respond (why should they? Do you offer an incentive? 
Will that affect results?) and how do you analyse the results (quantitative analysis of tick box answers? 
Textual analysis of their comments? Both? Record their body language as well?). And so on. Many of 
these questions are practical and detailed, but underpinning your approach there will be philosophical 
assumptions which you must make explicit.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Choosing research approaches and strategies
So designing your research will be vital and choosing a strategy will mean you have considered your 
views on truth and knowledge, social entities, what business research can and cannot achieve and how 
all this will affect what you actually do to answer a research question. 
So we have talked about the underpinning role of philosophy and research strategy, which then guides 
your choice of research method (e.g. survey, interview, grounded theory etc.) and whether they should 
be mixed, i.e. both qualitative and quantitative. These questions need settling and justifying before you 
rush off to ask people questions. 
3.7	
Classification of research
It is also helpful to think about different models of business research. Most subject disciplines are 
represented by various theories and models which give us language and ways of thinking to describe 
and understand real situations. When we look at business research, this is no different. The Figure below 
offers a way of classifying different approaches to business research.
Figure 4 Classification of approaches to business research
The figure shows four distinct types of business research. First we have exploratory research in which 
we are trying to identify or clarify a problem. Sorting out real problems from symptoms of the problem 
happens here. This phase is often qualitative, divergent and inductive in nature. The outcome is a better 
definition and understanding of a problem.
Descriptive research answers research questions which are largely “factual” in nature. These questions 
include those which start with “how”, “what”, “where”, “when”, “how much” and “how often”. In business 
these questions can often be solved by finding people with the answers, or by doing some simple digging 
for information (this kind of question is not usually suitable for an academic business research project 
as it is quite limited in scope).

Choosing research approaches and strategies
Correlational research looks for relationships between variables. These relationships may be correlational 
in the statistical sense which means that when one variable varies, another varies too, though not 
necessarily in the same direction. Correlation is an association of variables but that doesn’t mean the 
relationship is one of cause and effect. For example it may be found that more mistakes occur in the office 
when the boss is present. That doesn’t necessarily mean the presence of the boss has a direct causal effect 
on mistakes (it might! But it is not proven unless a different kind of research is undertaken). Determining 
cause and effect among and between variables is the fourth kind of research shown in this figure.
Causal or experimental research tests hypotheses and is designed to explain “why” something 
happened, i.e. to show cause and effect relationships. Conducting true experimental research in a 
business environment is not an easy thing to do. However there are variations of experimental research 
which do allow for making reasonably accurate “cause and effect” statements about phenomena and this 
is called “quasi-experimental” research.
3.8	
The Business Research Process
The figure below introduces an outline of the business research process, looking at its stages systematically.
This graphical representation looks like a static 5-step, two-dimensional process which appears linear. 
In practice we don’t always start at one end and follow each step through to the outcome. Remember, 
business research is often “messy”. So think of this diagram as the “line of best fit” for how business 
research is conducted. In the real world, business research is a dynamic, multi-dimensional and non-
linear process. Conducting business research is a bit like designing a bicycle and riding it at the same 
time. Downstream processes can affect previously determined upstream conclusions.

Phase 1 – Analyse – is critical. This phase of the business research process is primarily qualitative 
exploratory research as explained above. If you do not separate symptoms from problem at this stage, 
you may identify the wrong problem and come up with the wrong solution. This phase is often missed 
out or rushed through but that is neither efficient nor effective for a business organization. 
3.9	
The Academic business research process
We began this book explaining that we were talking about two different roles or “hats”. Figure 5 is 
addressed to the business role – this is what a manager or consultant is aiming to do for a business 
research project. However this book is also designed to help students of business, and you may find 
some small differences here in the process of achieving an academic business project. The steps are very 
similar but you need to pay attention to an assignment brief and the specific requirements of your study 
institution for the project. You are also required to produce conclusions in an academic project, not just 
recommendations for action. So below is the process to follow when conducting an academic business 
research project. Just like the business process, this diagram can be a bit misleading in that it looks 
linear, but in practice will be much messier. It is offered as a guide, not a requirement. Throughout this 
process, academic students are advised to keep in touch with their tutors/supervisors and above all, to 
keep a record of everything you do related to the research study for easier writing up later.

Questions for self review
1.	 Review the ideas of epistemology/ontology, research paradigms, validity and reliability, mixed 
and multi-methods and triangulation. How do all these relate to yourself as a researcher? 
2.	 If you used a mixed method approach, what reasons would you give to justify this choice? 
3.	 Which classification of research are you most comfortable with? Which do you think might 
be your weakness?

Understand how ethical issues arise in business research at every stage
4.2.1	
What do we mean by Ethics? 
Discussions of Ethics tend to sound worthy, sometimes border on the philosophical, and occasionally stray 
right off the point. Why should this be? Ethics relate to moral choices affecting decisions and standards 
and behaviour. So it is quite hard to lay down a set of clear rules, which cover all possible moral choices. 
Especially in research, where the practical aspects of a study (e.g. how and when to meet people for 
interview, which data to sample, how to deal with someone changing their mind about being part of a 
study, coming across information which you aren’t really supposed to have etc. and the potential isolation 
of you as the researcher (not being in a group or class all doing the same thing, but following your own 
research with your own objectives and contacts), as well as possible inexperience of research at this 
stage of your studies, can all contribute to a feeling of doubt and worry about what to do for the best. 
Sometimes it can be quite a shock, when you have been used to being given pretty clear ideas about how 
to do something, to find you have to make your own decisions about how things will be done. Ethical 
choices we have never imagined can just creep up and hit us. An obvious example would be when, as a 
very honest student, we start to collect some data together and realize that one source of data is completely 
out of step with the rest. As a professional researcher, that is an interesting challenge, which will create 
its own new pattern of research and investigation. But as a business student with a fast approaching 
hand-in deadline, the temptation to lose the odd data can be great.

Ethics in business research
We are not suggesting that we have to be great moral advocates here, perhaps that is a matter for our 
own consciences, but we must anticipate as much as we can the moral choices and dilemmas, which 
the practice of research will bring, and try to find appropriate ethical ways of dealing with them. 
Fundamental to our understanding of ethics in Business research is the idea that all research involving 
human subjects needs to be governed by good ethical practice, as well as any relevant legislation (e.g. 
protection of personal data). When we conduct primary research there are some key standards of good 
ethical practice to consider:
•	 Non-maleficence
•	 Beneficence
•	 Autonomy
•	 Justice
4.2.2	
How ethical issues can arise right through the research process
How can these broad philosophical notions affect our research study? Here is a brief list of the kinds of 
issue, which can arise at different points in the research process: 
•	 Access – physical, cognitive, continuing – just getting at the appropriate people can be frustrating 
and tempt researchers to cut corners. Don’t be tempted. 
•	 Participant acceptance/access (not just those in authority) – for example, you have permission 
to ask people in customer-facing positions some questions, but they don’t know you and are 
not sure how far to trust you – are you a representative of management? 
•	 Time – people just don’t respond in time for you to achieve project 
•	 Your identity as researcher – what do they know about your study? And how the data you 
collect will be used? And whose data is it, if they spoke or wrote it? 
•	 Re-phrasing research questions on basis of feasibility (not wrong) i.e. you find that your initial 
idea won’t work because you cannot gain access to the right people, so you may need to review 
your research question to one which is feasible, provided it is still valid and ethical. 
•	 Convenience sampling – e.g. using people we know to take part, which could produce 
participants who simply want to please you with their answers; or excluding troublesome views 
or statistics. E.g. including a poor sales year in an otherwise rising trend. Reality is messy – do 
we want to smooth the mess and create simple answers, or do we want to understand messy 
reality in order to change or anticipate it? 
•	 Data recording – what if tape or digital recorder doesn’t work? Can data be recreated from 
your notes? Do we pretend it worked? 
•	 Interviewing – e.g. what if the first interview turns up new ideas, which are then used in 
subsequent interviews – can you include that first one in your data set? What if an interviewee 
starts to see things in a new light and uncovers painful memories or ideas? Latter can also 
happen in focus groups- conflict, personal animosity could develop – how can this be handled?

Ethics in business research
•	 Your role in the data – we have already mentioned this, the researcher is not an object but 
a human being to whom people will react. What effect does this have on your data? Does it 
affect validity of results? 
•	 Transcripts – if you transcribe an interview or conversation, what happens to it? Whose is 
it? How do you label it (Jo Bloggs’ interview?). And how exactly do you transcribe? Do you 
include repeated phrases or words? Do you attempt to record body language which may affect 
the meaning of what is said? 
•	 Cheating in analysis when results don’t fit – this can affect both quantitative and qualitative 
research methods. Remember that provided the process was justified and conducted ethically 
and professionally, then a not very exciting outcome does not really matter. We cannot all 
discover gravity or relativity, but we can all design sound research plans and carry them out 
professionally. 
•	 Confidentiality in the report of your research – how do you ensure it? 
•	 Anonymity in the report – how do you deal with it? 
•	 Use of research data for new purposes – can you recycle data? How could you get ethical 
approval for this?

Ethics in business research
This link has some great information on statistical analysis, which we will return to later in the text 
when we discuss quantitative techniques. However this particular link shows with examples how easy 
it is to present data in such a way that they tell an inaccurate story, using value judgments, inadequate 
data summaries, inappropriate graph scales, incorrect pictogram sizes, coincidences and generalizing 
from small samples. 
Peter Corning (2011) writes in “The Fair Society” about how former British politician Benjamin Disraeli 
is noted for the famous quote “…there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.” Disraeli’s 
quote prompted the book “How to lie with Statistics” (Huff, D. 1954). Corning (2011) expands on this 
by classifying statistical trickery into several categories, including statistical cherry picking, the magic of 
averages, creative graphing, crunching diversity, small samples and mindless extrapolation. These books 
illustrate how facts can be distorted to present any perspective one wants to promote. Being aware of 
these techniques sometimes (consciously or subconsciously) used by researchers in presenting their 
findings is important in ensuring at least that you are an effective consumer of research.
There is also some useful discussion of ethical research issues in an article by Jane Richardson and Barry 
Godfrey (2003) which focuses on ownership and authority to use interview transcripts which may be 
in the public domain. 
4.3	
Ethical criteria used in Higher Education business research studies
Here are some broad pointers, check they make sense to you: 
1.	 Honesty and avoidance of deception (covert studies will rarely be sanctioned with HE and 
would always require ethical committee approval) 
2.	 Following ethical codes of any professional body involved or associated with this kind of 
research 
3.	 Full information about the purpose of the study and the researcher’s status and role 
4.	 Not to cause harm (including embarrassment, stress, discomfort, pain) by any action or 
omission of the research study 
5.	 Gaining informed consent to participate in the research study unless this would both invalidate 
the research and its absence could be approved by a research Ethics committee 
6.	 Respecting participants’ right to refuse to take part (at any stage) 
7.	 Respecting participants’ wish or need for anonymity and confidentiality 
8.	 Clarifying to participants and gatekeepers potential limits on anonymity and confidentiality 
9.	 Respecting assurances given to participants and gatekeepers concerning anonymity, 
confidentiality and use of data 
10.	Maintaining objectivity during data collection, analysis and report stages 
11.	Justifying and offer an audit trail for data collection and analysis 
12.	Where any possible question arises from the above, seeking the advice of the university or 
college ethical committee (though this may be a requirement of all research).

4.4	
Strategies to ensure ethical issues in business research are 
addressed appropriately
Some key themes and strategies to anticipate and deal with them are given below. 
4.4.1	
Stakeholder analysis 
For Ethics generally in business research, it can be helpful to start by working out who the stakeholders 
are in your proposed study. This may include the research participants, their managers and other team-
members, “gatekeepers” who may be senior managers or specific post-holders who can authorize your 
research, shareholders (in a private quoted company) who may be impacted if your research is detrimental 
to the company and is leaked, customers for the same reason but could be any kind of organization, 
yourself as researcher, yourself as student, competitors to this organization or activity?, suppliers? Can 
you identify any more stakeholders? Some will be specific to the kind of research study undertaken, for 
example a study of recruitment practices could affect potential employees. 
Once you know who might be affected by your research study, you could design a simple risk analysis:
– for each stakeholder identify the type of risk from your research, its potential impact (low, medium 
or high) and the probability that it will happen (unlikely, possible, probable). Entering this into a grid, 
will give you a clear idea of priorities in designing an ethical study, and should lead you to think about 
strategies to reduce undesirable impacts. 
Participant anonymity is usually a basic requirement in business research, unless using a research method 
where a particular identity is relevant to results and participants agree their association with the research. 
So what does participant anonymity involve? It is not usually just a case of not putting their names in 
the final report. It will be important to decide whether you need to devise a code for each participant 
(so you know who they are but they cannot be named by others), or whether this is not needed by the 
study so no-one will have a code or a name. Can you refer to their title, role, function, department, 
site etc.? All these, in conjunction with your results, may reveal identity. Is it appropriate to record the 
participant’s names on questionnaires? (this issue is not just to do with Ethics, since anonymity also affects 
how we answer questionnaires). Can you stop yourself referring to someone, in your study, to others in 
their company, who might try to identify them? If you have, for good reason, collected personal details, 
have you checked whether you comply with the requirements of any data protection legislation in your 
country? Why do you need to know someone’s age or gender or ethnic group? Does it really affect the 
research outcomes and thus will be important data to collect? Or could you redesign your study so that 
this kind of data was not important and need not be collected?

Ethics in business research
4.4.2	
Informed consent
Once you know where to look for participants in your study, and you have identified how to achieve 
ethical involvement for them and their organization, there is the practical business of achieving their 
consent. Informed consent requires you to prepare for all research participants some documentation 
which shows them what you are doing and why, what their role in the research is, what will happen to 
the data you collect from them and what they are agreeing to do. It will also usually set out how you will 
keep and dispose of the data and how the required confidentiality will be ensured. It will also set out 
how the participant can withdraw their consent at any time and you will not proceed with their data/
interview etc. This is very detailed and seems like a lot of work, but in fact a short text can often achieve 
all the requirements of informed consent. This, or a brief statement referring to this documentation, 
must then be signed by your participants. Remember that no undue pressure should be brought to bear 
on any participant or gatekeeper, since this, however well-intentioned, will influence their involvement 
in your research and will prove not only unethical, but may also invalidate results.

Ethics in business research
4.4.3	
Objectivity 
Let us assume that your motives are honest, in which case there are just two issues to tackle here. The first 
issue is the way data are collected and recorded. You may be using a specially designed relational database 
in which to record observations and related information, or we may be talking about a highlighter pen 
and notes in the margin of an interview transcript, or a clipboard and pencil. Whatever method is used 
to collect, and transfer data to a retrievable record, then it must be designed for purpose, systematic and 
capable of capturing all relevant details. Take for example a semi-structured interview method: what 
kind of system could be used to record the interview? 
Video recorder? Digital voice recorder? Tape recorder? Notepad and pen? Pro-forma with main questions 
and spaces to record answers? Reflect for a moment on what kind of issues could arise which might 
affect research objectivity depending on choice of system. 
Could any of these systems fail? If so, what would you do? How could you ensure continuing objectivity? 
The second issue is when a research study is under way and something unexpected happens to cause a 
problem with your data. This might be a rogue result which doesn’t fit the rest of the data. Or a failed 
tape recording. Or a key participant withdrawing from the study, as they have a right to do. At this stage 
of the research, however honest we are, there will be a temptation to fix the problem. So we should 
anticipate this temptation and understand, before it happens, that that is the road to failure in research. 
Academic and professional audiences will not be fooled, because they will understand and look for such 
issues. The moral responsibility of the researcher is considerable and when researchers are found to have 
transgressed, they are likely to be held to account in the media. To test this, search the web for media 
coverage of “fixed” or falsified research and its implications. Sadly, there are many examples to be found, 
but at least these will have been held to public account. 
4.4.4	
Practitioner researcher or internal researcher
This is an extreme case of having a potential unintended effect on the outcomes of your research. If you 
are researching an organization of which you are part, (even if you just have a casual or part-time job 
there) then you already have an understood role or status within this organization. It will be difficult for 
you suddenly to put on an “objective researcher” hat, and even if you could do this successfully, how easy 
would it be for your colleagues, or subordinates or managers to see you differently in this role? However, 
an internal researcher may be in a position to conduct a kind of research, which may be impossible from

Ethics in business research
It can be very tempting to undertake participant observation in a covert way in your own organization, 
but this clearly raises ethical issues and possible bias. Could you possibly find more useful and reliable data 
covertly than openly declaring your intention and gaining official agreement for access? In a few cases, 
the answer may be yes, but if so, there must be approval from any research Ethics committee relating to 
your studies or research (or professional body Ethics approval e.g. relating to your work function) and 
in retrospect you must inform those involved that the study took place and why access was not officially 
sought in advance. Assurances must then be given about the use to which the research data will be put 
and to what extent it will be anonymised. Spying is not research! 
4.5	
Plagiarism
It has always been possible to copy information from other sources into your work and pass them off as 
your own. However, with the rapid expansion of digital media and mobile web access this process has 
become much easier. Whenever cases of plagiarism are discovered in academic work, there are serious 
implications for the student, resulting in cancelled marks and sometimes greater sanctions such as forced 
withdrawal from a course. Digital applications are not just good for finding and copying someone else’s 
work as your own, they are also available to educational institutions to find plagiarism when it occurs. 
Clearly plagiarism is an ethical issue. While many excuses, including cross-cultural practice, are offered, 
it can never be good ethical practice to use someone else’s work without reference or acknowledgement. 
This includes putting quotations from other people’s work into quotation marks to demonstrate the 
existence of another source, as well as “in text” referencing and inclusion of full source details in the 
reference list. This does not just apply to text, but also of course to videos, music and graphics of any 
kind. Most business research projects undertaken for academic credit do not require images etc. but if 
they are necessary in your work, always look for graphics licensed by authors under a Creative Commons 
licence, and check the particular conditions under which it may be possible to use the graphic or image.

Understand how and why sampling relates to business research
Problem 1: the world is large and full of people. To find out things about people we need to ask (research) 
them. We usually can’t ask all of them because the numbers make this impossible. So we ask some of 
them. We sample the population. 
Problem 2: we wanted to find out things about people, so we researched a sample of them. To what extent 
do our results relate to all people, and to what extent do they only relate to our sample? 
Problems 1 and 2 put sampling in a nutshell. Sampling is a practical way of studying people and their 
activities, thoughts, attitudes, abilities, relationships etc. in relation to business. But because we are not 
asking everyone in the chosen “population” (which could be the members of a company, or all sales 
managers in the United States, or all applicants for a particular job – any group we define in relation 
to our research objective), then how can we have any certainty that our results can be representative of 
the whole population? 
The crunch is that we don’t want any old sample, we usually want a sample to be representative of a group 
(population). That would mean that our findings can be generalized to the whole group. To make this 
happen, we have to learn about a number of issues and technical words and phrases in sampling. In the 
next section there is a brief glossary based on Box 4.1 in Bryman and Bell (2011):

Choosing samples from populations
5.3	
Identify and use a range of probability and non-probability 
sampling techniques
The table below is a glossary of techniques associated with sampling. To learn more about each technique, 
read the textbook and web search further. 
Convenience sampling: 
Sample is chosen for ease or convenience rather than through random sampling. This 
sounds underhand but is often used, at least in pilot studies or short term projects where 
there is insufficient time to construct a probability sample. Therefore, where this is used, 
the results cannot be generalized to the population (though many newspapers would like 
you to believe otherwise!).
Generalisability: 
being able to use sample results as if they applied to the whole population – this must be 
based on sound sampling processes
Multi-stage cluster 
sampling: 
When drawing a sample from a geographically dispersed population, the logistics 
suggest that cluster sampling can help. The sampling frame is first broken into clusters 
(eg geographic areas), and a random or systematic sample taken. Then the population of 
each cluster is sampled randomly to provide random sampling which is logistically feasible. 
This can of course introduce bias, but using both cluster and systematic sampling can 
usually produce effective samples.
Non-probability sample: 
Random selection was not used so some units in the population may have had a higher 
chance of being selected (e.g. pointing to a crowd and saying “You, you and you!” to the 
people in front) Non-response: a source of non-sampling error when someone in the 
sample does not respond (e.g. to questionnaire or interview). A fair amount of this is 
normal and there are many reasons for it to happen (e.g. away on holiday, lack of time, 
lack of interest, doesn’t understand question etc.).
Non-sampling error :
as sampling error but these differences do not result from the sample chosen, instead they 
result from the sampling process (e.g. non-response, errors in sample frame, wording of 
questions, data analysis)
Population: 
the full universe of people or things from which the sample is selected
Probability sample: 
a sample selected using random selection (this is not the same as “selected randomly” – 
Why?) so that each unit in the population has a known (e.g. a 10% or 50%) chance of 
selection. Probability samples keep sampling error low and usually offer a sample which 
can be seen to be representative
Quota sampling: 
Regularly used in market research and opinion polling. Like a stratified sample, this 
sample is chosen to include a certain proportion of particular variables (e.g. gender, age 
group, ethnicity, socio-economic group). Unlike a stratified sample, there is no random 
sampling stage; the choice of respondent is up to the interviewer provided the profile/
quota is accurate.
Representative sample: 
one which reflects the population accurately – showing the same distribution of 
characteristics or variables as the whole population
Sample: 
the section of the population chosen for study
Sampling error: 
the difference of results between a sample and that of the whole population
Sampling frame: 
a list of all people or units in the population from which a sample can be chosen

Choosing samples from populations
Snowball sampling: 
Similar idea to convenience sampling, the researcher contacts an initial group of people 
relevant to the research topic, and then uses this group to contact others for the research. 
There is no sampling frame here, so it is not random, but sometimes it is difficult to 
pre-define the population (e.g. staff in a company who contribute creative ideas). This 
technique is often used in qualitative approaches.
Purposive sampling: 
Using your own judgement to select a sample. Often used with very small samples and 
populations within qualitative research, particularly case studies or grounded theory. 
This approach cannot yield any statistical inferences about the population. Cases may 
be selected for being unusual or special or particularly related to your research question.
Stratified sampling:
Random samples are just that and they can appear surprisingly “biased” or unrepresentative 
of the population (eg it would be possible for a random sample to include only one gender, 
which might affect your results). Stratified sampling specificies any characteristics, which 
you wish to be equally distributed amongst the sample, e.g. gender or work department. 
Provided the sampling frame can be easily identified by these characteristics, then strata 
for each characteristic are identified and within each group, random sampling or systematic 
sampling can proceed.
Systematic sample: 
Doing without random numbers in selecting a “random” sample. Sample is chosen 
directly from the sampling frame (which ideally should not be in any specific order 
except alphabetical). Once you know the sample proportion required e.g. 1 in 20, start 
with a random number generated item in the list, then choose every 20th name until the 
sample is complete.
Random sampling:
(also called probability sampling – see explanation above). Define the population. Define 
the sampling frame (F) (this may be the same or it may exclude certain groups or individuals 
as not relevant to the study). Decide the sample size (Z). Apply consecutive numbers to the 
full sampling frame (F=N). Using a table (or computer programme) to generate random 
numbers, collect Z amount of different random numbers within the range 1-N. Apply the 
chosen random numbers to the sampling frame to identify your random sample
Random number tables: 
Lists of numbers which are randomly generated – there is an example of such a table at 
Appendix 4 in the textbook. Used in random sampling. Use whatever digits in the random 
numbers apply within your sampling frame total and ignore duplicates. You may find it is 
simpler to use Excel spreadsheet function to generate random numbers. Formula to find 
a random number between 0 and 100 is =RAND()*100 Use F9 key to recalculate
Sampling fraction:
Number required for sample divided by number in total sampling frame expressed as a 
fraction or percentage. 
Of all the sampling techniques included in the table, quota sampling and convenience sampling, to some 
extent snowball sampling, are the least “statistical” in nature. These techniques offer varying levels of 
generalisability but are always less than a random sampling method. Think about these three techniques 
and decide how justified you think each is for conducting business research. 
5.4	
Select appropriate techniques for different research studies
When we are designing a research study, the most common question about sampling is – how large 
should the sample be? In the definitions of random sampling above, we have ignored this question so it 
is now time to tackle it. Unfortunately there is no right answer to sample size. You cannot just apply a 
consistent proportion to the total sample frame. Instead the following issues need consideration:

Choosing samples from populations
5.4.1	
Absolute sample size:
it is more important to look at the absolute size of a sample than its relative size in relation to the total 
population. Imagine 10% of a population as a possibly sensible sample. If the population total is 100,000, 
then your sample size is 10,000 – yes this would probably be a good sample size (but see the next problem 
on this list). However if we apply a 10% sample size to a population of 10, we have a sample of 1 unit or 
person. We can see that this unit or person could be quite unrepresentative of the total population by 
itself. So relative sample size is not important. Absolute size is. The bigger the sample size, the more the 
sample is likely to represent the population and the lower is likely to be the sampling error. (Referred 
to as the Law of Large Numbers). 
5.4.2	
Statistics and the Central limit theorem:
 the larger the absolute size of a sample, the more closely its distribution will be to the “normal distribution” 
(What is this? If you have not done any work on statistics before, do some quick web-searching or 
look at the index of the textbook to find out). If you wish to conduct a statistical analysis on your data, 
the minimum size of sample for any one category of data should be 30, as this is most likely to offer a 
reasonable chance of normal distribution. If your sample frame is 30 or less, then it would be wise to 
include the whole frame, rather than sampling.

Choosing samples from populations
5.4.3	
Margin of error:
The expected margin of error is affected by absolute size of sample within a population. Note that a 
5% margin of error (which is the same as saying 95% certainty) is the maximum normally appropriate 
for rigorous research. If your population size was 50, you would have to include at least 44 of them to 
achieve a 95% certainty that the sample would represent characteristics of the population. A very high 
proportion of the population will be needed to achieve 99% certainty. There is a diminishing need 
for higher samples at the high population end of the table (the figures to achieve 95% certainty for a 
population of 1m are the same as for a population of 10m). 
5.4.4	
Time and cost:
Bryman and Bell (2011) suggest the law of diminishing returns kicks in at around a sample size of 
1000 – i.e. that precision in the data increases up to a sample total of 1000, but then begins to decrease, 
making it less worthwhile to interview or survey more than 1000. Of course, the population you are 
researching may be way below 1000 in total, and it may in any case be very costly or time-consuming 
to use a large sample size. Practical considerations are important in research studies. Just bear in mind 
that if you choose a sample size which is small in absolute terms, then you must justify this action and 
take into account the fall in generalisability and representativeness which may result. 
5.4.5	
Non-response:
this is described as normal in the glossary above. Inevitably your respondents are less likely to be as 
motivated as you, the researcher, about your research, so some – and sometimes a majority – will not 
respond, ie refuse to take part. On top of this, some of those who do respond may not produce “useable” 
data (e.g. you may find that a high proportion of questions in a survey are unanswered, or that some 
people or units in your sample frame have moved away, changed job, stopped functioning in the role you 
expected etc.). All this is taken into consideration when a) choosing your sample size and b) calculating 
the actual response rate. 
Number of useable responses 	
	
	
× 100%
Total sample – unsuitable or uncontactable units 
5.4.6	
Variation in the population:
if the population you are studying is highly varied, then the sample size will need to be larger than if 
you are studying a population with less variation (e.g. people who have chosen to join a membership 
organization).

Understand and assess representativeness of samples and generalisability 
from samples 
Even if we use probability sampling techniques, we can only hope to produce generalisable outcomes 
in relation to the population we were sampling. So if all questionnaire respondents are chosen from 
one company or organization, the best to hope for is that our results can be generalized to the whole 
workforce of that company or organization. We cannot assume that these results will in fact describe 
other workforces, as very different conditions and variables may apply in other organizations. 
The Sample versus the Sampling Frame. This issue has to do with the accuracy or “completeness” of the 
Target Population. Suppose you want to conduct research on all people with telephones in a given city. 
Where would you get the “list” of these people? Whatever “object” or device you use is the “sampling 
frame”. What are some potential problems that lie between the composition of the actual population, 
the sample and the sample frame?
A sampling dilemma: You are a store owner and you want to know the average age and income of your 
“customers”. How would you identify them? What is your sampling frame? Do you really ever entirely 
know who all your customers are? Think about how customer “churn” (turnover) impacts your estimate.
In a similar way, we could conduct a large sample study by random sampling a country’s population based 
on official census statistics, and if the study was large and rigorous, we might propose conclusions, which 
apply to this country’s population (with a specified degree of confidence in the statistics). However, we 
cannot then generalise these conclusions to other countries without further research, nor can we apply 
these conclusions over time to the same country, as major variables could have changed over time. Think 
back here to what we discussed earlier about epistemology – what we can really know. 
We find this kind of generalization being made all the time in the media. For practical time and cost 
reasons, media production teams often take quota sampling research (or research done by more dubious 
methods) and suggest its applicability to everyone watching or listening to a programme. Look out 
for examples and try to find out what kind of sampling was applied to their research. Remember the 
Ethics discussion about not causing “harm” – how does this relate to TV, radio or webcast research you 
come across? 
If you are worried about the representativeness of your sample, in some cases it may be possible to 
check this by using a test of statistical significant difference to compare the profile of characteristics 
in your sample with that of another data list e.g. a census or company database. Clearly if there is no 
statistically significant difference between your sample and the full population data list, you have added 
more authority to the representativeness of your sample.

Choosing samples from populations
If you are using a non-probability sampling technique then even the flimsy size rules associated with 
probability sampling fall away. Your sample size for purposive or snowball sampling will really depend 
on your research questions and objectives. In qualitative research, the focus will not be on trying to 
estimate things about a population, but in trying to understand or relate the data to theory or ideas. 
How many people do you need to talk to, to understand their perception of something for example? It 
could be just one. Or it could be several or many. The question is here, what are you trying to find out 
and what sample size would give me confidence that my results had validity? We will go further into this 
when we discuss different qualitative methods, but often a good lead can be taken from research studies 
in peer-reviewed academic journals, where information has been given about sample size in relation to 
research question. Find one that is close to your area of study (which you would want to do anyway in 
your literature review) and check the sample size studied in this type of enquiry.

Choosing samples from populations
After you have completed the exercise, answer the following 4 questions:
•	 What was the average diameter of your (non-random) selection?
•	 What was the average diameter of the random selection?
•	 Which was closer to the actual average diameter of the population (all 60 circles)?
•	 If you increased your sample size from 5 to say 25, how do you think it might affect the average 
diameter of your selection?
Explain how this simulation could apply to a real world business environment or example (i.e. translate 
the “dots” into employees, or customers, or products of the assembly line etc.) and describe how the 
simulation would apply. Try to incorporate correct terminology from the chapter into your explanation.

Anticipating how the research design is affected by data collection and 
analysis tools 
It is never too early to start to think about data analysis. A common problem with research studies is 
that we focus mostly on our research questions and finding samples, discussing methods etc. and don’t 
ask simple questions about what data we are looking for and how we will then analyse that data. Asking 
these questions early on, can avoid much disappointment later, when we realise that the data collected 
simply can’t be analysed in a straightforward way. 
Suppose for example that you want to know the three most useful management textbooks that a large 
group of 100 managers have found effective. The question might look like this: 
Q1 What are the three management books which have been most useful to you so far in your management 
career? 
You might leave three lines of space so that the respondents can write in their answers. 
Think about how this might be coded as a question response for analysis. Since most managers will 
not choose the same three, you will have a wide range of different answers. We cannot code each book 
separately with a sample size of 100 and 300 potential books in the answer range. So can we make any 
useful data out of this question?

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
You might answer that you wouldn’t ask this kind of question anyway! However it is a form of question 
which is quite common e.g. What five competencies are needed by successful salespeople?, What are 
the three most important experiences which have helped you to achieve your current senior role? What 
three benefits do you feel you have gained from mentoring? Etc. etc. 
It is possible to turn the question into a list of possible answers from which respondents have to tick three 
which apply to them. This means you can give each possible answer a unique code in advance and then 
count the frequency with which each code is used. However if you want your respondent to have a free 
answer choice, because perhaps you really don’t know what you might find out, then we have to delay 
coding until we have received some answers. If we take the first 50 responses and make notes on the 
characteristics, which define the responses, it becomes possible to group the responses. Once grouped, 
a code can be assigned to each group and you can then go back and code each answer according to this 
pre-defined group. In our question, we might find that answers include classical management textbooks 
from the twentieth century (coded 1), simple How to… guides (coded 2), books by management “gurus” 
e.g. Tom Peters, Charles Handy etc. (coded 3), books which are not about management directly but have 
given readers inspiration (coded 4) and books which don’t fall into those categories (coded 5). We now 
have 5 unique codes and can go through all the responses collecting numerical data for each code. Now 
we have a data set for analysis.

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
A much more simple issue is the questionnaire which contains only yes/no answers. Think about analysing 
this data. A set of data results is going to look pretty boring, and how much is it going to tell you about 
your research question? In the next chapter we will investigate questionnaires further, but for now, we 
need to think about the data which will result from our questions, how useful it might be, and how we 
might analyse it. 
6.3	
Recognising different levels of data for analysis
Think of “Numbers” as the official language of business. All competent business people speak in numbers. 
Business professionals don’t just say ‘we did well yesterday”. We say “productivity was 8,000 units, a .5% 
increase from yesterday”. We also don’t merely say “margins are fine”. We say “margin is 3.76%”. It’s the 
difference between being qualitative or quantitative. And statistical method is the way we “process” 
this data. 
Another name for numbers is data and another purpose of business research is to take this data and 
convert it into meaningful information and knowledge for use by the organization in order to improve 
the quality of decision making. The business research process helps the business professional collect 
meaningful data and convert it into knowledge, information and power. This is what is meant by what 
we often hear as knowledge is power in the organization. As a business professional you are paid by your 
organization for what you know. Your knowledge is power and that’s what you bring to the organization. 
Not all data and numbers are the same. In fact, data can be classified into four levels, forming a hierarchy 
from the lowest level of data to the highest level of data. The statistics that you can generate and use 
depends upon the level of the data you have to work with. It’s not that low level data is useless, it’s just 
not as robust as high level data. And because of its hierarchical nature, data at higher levels can be treated 
as if it’s at a lower level, but lower level data cannot be treated as higher level data. 
6.3.1	
Nominal Data. 
The first or lowest level of data is nominal. Nominal data uses numbers to represent a category. Nominal 
level data does not imply any form or rank order of importance or power. Numbers are merely used 
to classify things into categories. A survey asking people where their car was made, using numbers to 
represent these countries makes sense from a data processing perspective. A “1” is assigned for GB, “2” 
for USA, “3” for Germany. “4” for Japan, etc. The “number” merely classifies the category and assigns it 
a number. A social security number, a phone number, your student number, and an employee number 
are examples of nominal data. The numbers on the strip assigned to football players is also a nominal 
level number. Nominal level data can have 2 or more categories. When Nominal level data have just 2 
categories (yes/no; on/off, etc.) it is referred to as a dichotomous variable. Dichotomous variables are a 
special case of nominal level data.

6.3.2	
Ordinal Data. 
The second level of data is called Ordinal data. This has all the properties of nominal data but it also infers 
a rank or order of importance from lowest to highest. Ordinal data is often the result of questionnaires 
where grouping data makes sense. For example, questionnaires might ask how old are you? (1) 18 to 
25, (2) 26 to 40, (3) 41 to 55, (4) 55 to 67 or (5) 68 or older. Ordinal level data “ranks things from low 
to high, but there is not an implied equal interval between one number and the next.
Nominal and ordinal level data collectively are often referred to as “low level” (or qualitative) data
6.3.3	
Interval Data. 
The next highest level of data is called Interval level data. Interval data has all the properties of ordinal 
level data but it is more powerful than ordinal level data because a scale value is used. That is, interval 
level data implies an “equal interval” between one number and the next – that’s the distance between one 
number and the next. This data is meaningful but it lacks an arbitrary zero. Data from the social sciences 
is often at the interval level, because of this issue – it lacks an absolute zero. As a result, researchers 
often treat interval level data as if it is ratio level. The interval data level was created in order to allow 
“quasi-ratio” data to be treated as such for statistical purposes.
6.3.4	
Ratio Data: 
The highest level of data is called ratio level data. It has all of the properties of interval level data but it 
also has an absolute zero. An absolute zero means that “0” indicates the absence of that property, making 
ratios meaningful. This is the most versatile data for analysis purposes. For example, your age, specific 
salary, your weight, the number of employees in your company is ratio level data. 100 employees is twice 
as many as 50. A person weighing 200 pounds weighs twice as much as a person weighing 100 pounds.
Interval and Ratio level data are collectively referred to as “high level” (or quantitative) data.

Coding and entering data for computer analysis
6.4.1	
Data matrix 
In order to analyse quantitative data, once we have identified the kinds of variable we are collecting, we 
can then set out the data in a matrix. This can be done in Excel or another spreadsheet first, or put directly 
into a statistical package such as SPSS for Windows. To make the transition from, say, questionnaire to 
data matrix, answers will need coding. For example, nominal variables will be text names and will need 
to be given a unique number to allow entry into a statistical package. Non-responses will also need a 
unique recognisable number (which doesn’t appear elsewhere in the data). Dichotomous responses such 
as Male/Female will also need a number e.g. Male= 1; Female= 2.

6.4.2	
Coding
Most sources recommend that you keep a “code book” or list of exactly how the codes you devise for 
your data relate to the questionnaire or other research element. This is vital for two reasons. The first 
is that codes are often worked out on scraps of paper quite quickly; if the paper is lost and you have a 
break between entering your data and coming to make sense of it, it is possible you will have a hard 
time remembering exactly what the results mean. 
The second is that it is important not to lose sight of the question when analysing the results of quantitative 
data. Unusual patterns in the data must be scrutinised and going back to exact coding and possible 
different interpretations of the question wording, which may have caused the response, will be vital. So 
keep a retrievable, clear and accurate record of coding as the link between respondent and data. 
6.4.3	
Using SPSS for Windows 
Coding is a way of enlisting the help of computer analysis techniques – whether these involve using a 
spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel, or a package like the commonly used SPSS (Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences) for Windows package which is specifically designed to analyse quantitative data from 
social sciences research. SPSS for Windows is the most commonly used tool to produce all statistical tests 
and analysis outlined in the sections below. Using the package is very straightforward, provided you have 
access to it on a computer. Start the program, which should put you into the SPSS Data Editor, which 
has two components: Data View and Variable View. Screen tabs allow you to switch between these two 
views. Data View is the screen through which you enter your data (like a spreadsheet). You must enter 
your data so that each column represents a variable, and each row represents a case. For example, if you 
have information on the age, salary and qualifications of 100 employees, you enter the variable data for 
each employee along a row, with column headings of age, salary, qualifications. 
It is probably obvious, but in data view you will not enter any text. To describe your variables, you go to 
Variable View. Text variable names can be a maximum of 8 characters with no spaces. This means it is 
helpful to make a rough plan of how you will enter data into SPSS – in which order you will show the 
variables and what variable names you will use. There is a field called “variable label” in which you can 
put more detailed text if needed. It is also possible to enter labels for Values (all except interval values), 
so for example you may have a variable labelled Gender, which has values labelled Male and Female, 
though you have coded Male as 1 and Female as 2 in the Data view. Value and variable labels will be 
used by SPSS in the Output charts. 
When you perform an analysis with SPSS (by clicking Analyse and entering any relevant information 
about what you want done) it is held as Output in an Output viewer screen (which only appears after 
an analysis has been done).

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
While not particularly difficult, statistical formulas and calculations can be lengthy (depending on the 
size of the data set) and thus often prone to simple calculation errors. The beauty of using SPSS, or any 
other statistical software program is that the researcher can focus on understanding the statistics and 
interpreting them rather than on calculating the statistics. The researcher need only focus on careful 
data planning and data entry. Once entered into the software, the program then creates an electronic 
version of the original data and codebook.
6.4.4	
Weighting cases 
It is possible to weight cases when using stratified random sampling and when there is an unequal 
response rate for different strata. This is simple to do and researchers do this from time to time, but it 
does impose constraints on how statistical inferences can be drawn, since cases in the lower response 
stratum are treated as if there were more of them than there are (i.e. higher weighting in the dataset). 
Best avoided if possible unless you are really confident in statistics. 
6.5	
Choosing appropriate ways to present data through charts, tables and 
descriptive statistics
You may have a clear idea of what you are looking for in the data, but once the data is entered into either 
a spreadsheet or an analysis package like SPSS, other possible ways of analysing the data become apparent.

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
We usually begin by attempting to describe particular values, their range, their central tendency, their 
dispersion around the mean. We can look at the data trends over time, and look for proportions in the 
data. This is called univariate analysis because we are looking usually at one variable at a time. 
Once we have a clear picture of how the individual variables are behaving, we can start looking for 
relationships between variables – bivariate analysis. A range of methods is shown below for these two 
kinds of analysis. 
6.5.1	
Frequency tables – univariate. 
Tables show a list of categories (types of response) and the numbers of people responding to each. 
Sometimes just as a number, sometimes a percentage of the total choosing this response. When building 
a frequency table for interval level variables, categories will usually be grouped (if not the table would 
probably be too long). Make sure your groups of categories are exclusive eg for ages 21–30, 31–40 etc. 
not 20–30, 30–40 as this leads to difficulties of coding for age 30. 
6.5.2	
Bar charts, histograms and pie charts – univariate 
These are generally used for nominal or ordinal variables, so bars will be separated along the x axis. If 
using an interval variable, then a histogram would be used rather than a bar chart. It looks very similar 
but the axis shows a continuous interval range and adjoining “bars” are not separated. Note that pie 
charts should not show more than six segments – more than this will be very difficult to read, so either 
use a bar chart, or group the data before producing the pie chart. 
6.5.3	
Measures of central tendency – univariate 
This will be mean (average), median (midpoint value in ranked list) or mode (most frequently occurring 
value) in a range of values. The measure is a single figure so is not representable in a chart, however, a 
series of means, medians etc. can be charted or shown in a table. Mean can only be calculated for interval 
level variables. Median can be calculated for interval or ordinal variables. Mode can be calculated for 
any variable. 
6.5.4	
Measures of dispersion – univariate 
This will be the range (difference between maximum and minimum value in a list of interval variables), 
the inter-quartile range (data must be in rank order, then this will show the difference within the middle 
50% of values) or the standard deviation (data should be normally distributed for this to be effective). 
The standard deviation is the average amount of variation around the mean (calculated by taking the 
difference between each value and the mean, totalling these differences and dividing the total by the 
number of values). A higher standard deviation therefore means greater variation around the mean.

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
We might use a box plot to look at both central tendency and dispersion in a chart format (SPSS can 
produce these from your data). The box plot shows where the median of the data lies and how the data 
clusters around that median or middle value. 50% of the data will lie in the “interquartile range” shown in 
the box plot as a rectangle with the median line cutting vertically through it. In this example, the median 
is off-centre to the left, so we can see that this set of values is “skewed positively”, rather than showing 
a classic normal distribution (see notes on sampling). The plot shows with an extended horizontal line 
the extent of the lower quartile (i.e. the 25% of the data with the lowest values) and the higher quartile – 
same but for the highest values. There are two more values from the data set which sit outside the range 
of most of the data, called “outliers” – they are on the right of the chart. This kind of chart is useful 
when in your research you want to give an interquartile range (“half of the values are between x and 
y”) and to see whether a normal distribution applies. This will also affect your later statistical analysis. 
6.5.5	
Charts, diagrams and tables – the detail 
It is probably quite obvious, but all diagrams etc. which are presented in a research report will need to 
be checked for detail. When you are putting the last minute touches to a report before a deadline (at 
study and at work) it is easy to imagine that everyone will know what this graph shows. This leads to a 
big problem if we leave it at that. You must check each graph to ensure it has a clear title, the units of 
measurement involved are shown, any data source is shown, the sample size is shown where relevant, 
the axes are labelled, the variables read in a comparable way if more than one chart uses the same axes 
and variables e.g. left to right or top to bottom and there is a key or legend which is readable (importing 
from Excel often leads to very tiny illegible legends – they must be reformatted). It can also be helpful 
to introduce a chart in the text with an idea for the reader of what it will show, then after the chart in 
the text, explain what you think it showed. Of course, readers will want to make up their own minds, 
but it is helpful to let them know what you think they should look for in the chart. 
6.5.6	
Trends over time 
Usually shown in a line graph where time is on the horizontal axis. This is always a good first step. Then 
if you wish to look at a trend over time for a single variable, the most common method is the use of 
index numbers – such as the FTSE100 index of share movements over time based in London (FTSE 
stands for Financial Times Stock Exchange) or the Standard and Poor (S&P) 500 based in New York. 
The base period is usually represented by the number 100 (or 1000 as in FTSE). 
The FTSE100 is an index of the stock value of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, whereas the S&P 500 represents an index value of the 500 largest companies on the NYSE or 
NASDAQ. Rather than the mere “average price” of the component stocks, these indices are “weighted” 
by the market value of each company providing for a more meaningful metric.

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
In a simple index, each value is converted to an index number by dividing the data value for the case 
by the data value for the base period and multiplying by 100. Why bother converting each value to an 
index number? Generally because it makes comparison across time or numbers much simpler – can be 
done at a glance. 
Try to find an example (from the web or media) of a trend using index numbers. 
Suppose we want to take the trend further and estimate where it will go after the actual data we have to 
hand? Here we are into forecasting and we will be covering this in our last but one chapter. 
6.6	
Selecting appropriate statistical tools for the research variables
6.6.1	
Relationships between variables – bivariate analysis 
.Relationships between variables means the variation in one variable coincides with variation in another 
variable, it does not imply a causal or “cause and effect” relationship, i.e. it does not necessarily follow that 
one will be an independent and one a dependent variable. Though this can sometimes seem obvious – 
e.g. if the two variables include something like age or gender which can influence the other variable but 
not be influenced by other variables. (Presumably the amount you eat could be influenced by your age, 
but your age could not be influenced by the amount you eat!).

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
6.6.2	
Contingency tables or cross-tabulations – bivariate 
Set up as a frequency table including column percentages but showing both variables against the chosen 
categories. If one variable is suspected of being the independent variable, this is shown as a column 
variable not a row variable. Such tables are used to look for patterns of association in the data. Frequency 
tables display low level data – just a frequency count of how many times an event occurs.
6.7	
Measures of Correlation – the correlation coefficient
A correlation coefficient is a statistic which is designed to quantify the degree of correlation between two 
variables. Generally speaking, a correlation coefficient will be expressed as a number which will either 
be positive or negative. The “sign” (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship, i.e. 
+1 is a perfect positive relationship (as one variable increases, the other increases, and -1 is a perfect 
negative relationship (as one variable increases the other decreases). The absolute value of the number 
indicates the strength of the relationship. The value will be between 0 (indicating no relationship) and 
1 (indicating a perfect relationship). Calculating correlation coefficients is easy, BUT they are subject 
to error due to the numerous (albeit simple) calculations which have to be made. Using a statistics 
program such as SPSS makes the calculations easy as all the researcher has to do is enter the raw data. 
The program does the error proof work (assuming error proof data entry)!
There are 4 different types of correlation coefficients which are described below. The choice of which to 
use depends upon the level of data being used for the variables being correlated.
6.7.1	
Pearson’s r (also called the Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient 
(PMCC)) – bivariate
The Pearson r looks for a relationship between two interval level variables. Before calculating a Pearson 
r, it is worth constructing a scatter diagram for the two variables, as it should only be used when there 
is a broadly linear relationship, it will not hold for a curve relationship. The scatter plot provides a visual 
image of the correlation.
6.7.2	
Spearman’s rho (ρ) – bivariate 
The Spearman rho is used when at least one of the two variables is ordinal level data , and the other is 
ordinal or interval level data. This calculation produces the same kind of outcome as Pearson’s r, i.e. a 
positive or negative relationship between 0 (no relationship) and 1 (perfect relationship). 
6.7.3	
Eta – bivariate 
Eta is used to explore relationships between an interval level variable and a nominal level variable. Eta 
can only show strength of relationship, not direction. It does not assume a linear relationship.

6.7.4	
Phi coefficient (Φ) and Cramér’s V – bivariate 
Phi is used for exploring a relationship between two dichotomous variables, Cramér’s V does the same for 
two nominal level variables. Phi outcomes are like Pearson’s r and Spearman’s rho and can vary between 
0 and + or –1. Similar to the Eta, Cramér’s V can only show strength of relationship, not direction (the 
coefficient is always positive). 
6.8	
Regression analysis
Regression analysis is a coefficient of determination (it can also be called a regression coefficient). It can 
be calculated by squaring the value of Pearson’s r and multiplying it by 100. This produces a percentage, 
which describes the proportion of variation in one dependent variable accounted for by the other 
independent variable. So if we explored the relationship between age and weight in a sample, producing 
a Pearson’s r value of -0.35, then the coefficient of determination would be 12.25%, which suggests that 
in our sample 12.25% of the variation in weight was accounted for by variation in age. A similar analysis 
where more than one independent variable is involved is called multiple regression analysis. (This will 
be discussed further in Chapter 11)
6.9	
Statistical significance
A way of testing the level of confidence we can have that a probability sampling technique has generated 
results, which can apply to the full population. Such a test can also estimate the chances of no relationship 
in fact existing between two variables, when bivariate analysis suggests that there is. We often use the 
word “significant” to mean the same as important when we are writing text. Your understanding of the 
phrase “statistical significance” should prevent you from now on from using “significant” in academic 
work, unless you are relating this to a statistical test. 
To calculate statistical significance, we set up a “null hypothesis” i.e. that two variables in the sample are 
not related. Then decide the level of statistical significance we find acceptable, i.e. the level of risk that we 
would reject the null hypothesis (i.e. say the variables are related) when in fact they were not related. It 
is usual to say that the maximum level of 0.05 is acceptable (i.e. p<0.05). This suggests that in no more 
than 5 cases out of 100, will we be wrong (i.e. suggest a relationship which is not there) – the same as 
saying we have 95% certainty that the relationship is correct. We can choose a more stringent level of 
certainty (e.g. p<0.01 where there is only a 1 in a 100 chance of our relationship not existing when we 
say it does). This would, however, increase the risk of a “Type 2 error”, which means confirming the null 
hypothesis (that there is no relationship) when in fact there is a relationship.

Quantitative research methods: collecting and analysing data
We should bear in mind that the likelihood of a statistically significant result will increase with sample 
size – for the obvious reason that the bigger the sample in relation to the population, the less likely that 
any analysis on the sample will differ from the population by chance. So if we think there is likely to be 
low statistical significance, we should increase sample size if possible, to make the analysis more sensitive 
to statistical significance. Very small samples, below 30, are more likely to show an unacceptable p level 
i.e. above 0.05 probability that the difference is caused by chance. 
We use a chi-square test (x 2) to produce our level of statistical significance ( or probability level). This 
test looks at each cell in a contingency table and calculates the expected value if there was no relationship 
but the value was a product of chance, works out the difference between each expected value and the 
given value and sums the differences. This produces a single chi square value for the table, which is not 
important in itself, but is produced with a statistical significance level (ρ). This is the number we are 
looking for, to check against our desired level of certainty. The chi-squared test can only be used with 
nominal level data and provides a useful method for determining statistical significance when dealing 
with such low level data.
As well as applying chi-square tests to contingency tables, tests of statistical significance should be applied 
to all bivariate analysis outcomes (coefficients) such as Spearman’s rho and Pearson’s r. This helps us to 
be sure that the correlation we expect from the sample, really does exist in the population.

6.9.1	
Testing whether groups are different – multivariate analysis 
If we want to test whether the distribution of a variable in a sample is similar to or different from the 
distribution of a population or census which is already known, then we can use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test (only if data is ranked). The test produces a D statistic, which is used to calculate whether the sample 
distribution differs from the full population distribution by chance only. 
Where we have a quantifiable variable which can be split into two independent groups of values using 
a descriptive variable, we can test the probability of the groups being significantly different using an 
independent groups t-test. The lower the t statistic, the more likelihood of any difference in the two 
different groups being caused by chance. 
Similarly a paired t-test can be used to measure similar pairs of variables, e.g. a machine’s speed of 
operation before and after maintenance. The paired t-test is used when the measures being compared 
are from the same group (e.g. before/after).
Differences between three or more groups can also be tested to see if they are likely to be occurring by 
chance or if there is really a “statistically significant difference” – this is done using one-way analysis of 
variance, ANOVA, and produces an F statistic plus a significance probability level. A high F statistic and 
a significance p level of below 0.05 should offer a “statistically significant” result, ie not one occurring by 
chance. An ANOVA example might involve members of three or more different groups of staff producing 
values for “degree of learning” after a training course. The ANOVA test can establish whether different 
results in degrees of learning after training which seem to be shown by the different staff groups could 
occur by chance, or whether there is a “statistically significant” difference between them. There are some 
data requirements for ANOVA, but broadly this can be used provided there are at least 30 values in each 
group and each value is independent of others. Whereas t-tests compare either two different groups, or 
the same group twice, ANOVA allows the researcher to compare 2 or more groups at the same time. 
Both t-tests and ANOVA require high level data.
This chapter has been very factual and is not easy to take in, unless you are already familiar with statistical 
analysis and find it easy to follow. It is intended just to give some revision pointers based on earlier 
reading or teaching you may have experienced. 
You might like to consider the following question to think through this area. If I asked the question: 
“Please rank order the following benefits of a colour laser printer: speed, professional output, capacity 
for more than one ream of paper, faster speed on black and white print, capability to back copies, other”. 
Then what kind of values will be produced if 100 people respond to this question? (a) how would we 
code each response, including the “other” response? (b) and what kind of technique could we use to 
analyse the response data, and here we could assume that we know whether the respondent actually 
uses laser printers or not.

Appreciate and overcome the difficulties associated with 
questionnaire design
Questionnaires can be a powerful source of information. But effective questionnaire design is of utmost 
importance if you want to get the information you desire. To begin with, you must decide what the purpose 
(objective) of the questionnaire is, and ultimately what are the research questions you want to answer as 
a result of using a questionnaire. From there you then begin to design questions which accomplish your 
objective. You also need to consider the length of the questionnaire. Respondents who begin to suffer 
from “survey fatigue” will often either fail to finish the questionnaire or just mindlessly rush through the 
questions to finish it quickly. As a researcher, you want to eliminate both of those possibilities.
What kind of difficulties and problems arise with questionnaires? Surely it is quite straightforward to 
write them? It is said that a person’s wisdom can be judged by the questions they can compose rather 
than the answers they know! In fact, designing questionnaires is particularly difficult. What do we need 
to think about when designing effective questionnaires? 
1.	 The format and design of the questionnaire – not too offputting, not too long, not too difficult 
to read, easy to know what you have to do to complete it 
2.	 How much general information do you need to have about the respondent? If you need 
biographical data such as age and gender etc., why is that? What extra value will it add to 
your research question? Should you start with easy questions like gender or end with them?

Questionnaire design and testing
3.	 What proportion of open and closed questions should be in the questionnaire? Closed questions 
start with a verb (Do you come here often?) and invite a simple yes/no answer. Or they may be 
“forced-choice” i.e. only a limited number of alternative answers are available to choose from. 
They are easy to code but limiting in detail. Open questions give much richer information but 
are widely variable across responses and therefore harder to code and analyse. 
4.	 What kind of questions can we ask? Straight questions with a clear answer? Questions about 
which people must reflect? Tickbox questions or written answer questions? Numerical scale 
questions? These are rating scale questions which allow the respondent to mark a numerical 
scale in response to a question; for example “How important is it to have a clear organizational 
policy on harassment at work?” Answers may range from 1 (not important at all) to 4 (very 
important). Likert scales often have middle points which allow a neutral response. How do we 
lay out the questions? For example, if they are scale responses – do we lay them out horizontally 
or vertically? 
5.	 How much space on the page do you give someone to write an answer to an open question? 
6.	 Should you include check questions, for example asking the same thing two different ways to 
ensure you are getting consistent answers? 
7.	 How much information do you give the respondent about why you are asking the questions? 
Technical research detail? Just enough to know who you are and how data will be used? 
8.	 How do they get it back to you? If email – what does that do to anonymity? Should you include 
stamped addressed envelopes, drop boxes? 
9.	 Should you communicate with potential respondents before the survey itself? And after delivery 
to encourage completion? How many times could you prompt for a reply? 
10.	Should you use post, fax, email or online surveys? 
11.	What happens if the response rate is too small to be useful? 30% is considered a minimum but 
this will depend on the volume of response.
12.	What if some of the questions are misunderstood? How can I prevent this happening? 
13.	Should I use incentives for survey return? How does that affect results? 
14.	How many surveys should be used for a pilot survey to test the questions? Can we use pilot 
responses in the results? 
15.	Where do I keep returned surveys? 
16.	How much do I have to spend on printing and/or designing and/or posting out and chasing 
questionnaires? Can they go out with other mailings to save cost, or will this lower the 
response rate? 
You may like to search online for an article by Vidal Diaz de Rada on Questionnaire Design (Diaz de 
Rada, V., 2005). This author discusses some of the formatting details for questionnaires such as size, 
colour and cover page. All these factors play an important role in your response rate by those asked to 
complete the questionnaire.

Questionnaire design and testing
These are all practical questions which are best answered in the context of your specific research questions 
in relation to the actual population who will receive the questionnaire. You probably already have views 
about the answers, but if not, these are all detailed practical issues which you will have to decide before 
sending out your questionnaire. 
7.3	
Choosing from a range of question formats
Textbooks generally list the following as types of closed questions used in questionnaires: 
1.	 List – select any answer of those provided (offer an “other” category if necessary)
2.	 Category – select one answer (also called multiple choice) 
3.	 Ranking – put answers in order 
4.	 Rating – score or give a value to answers 
5.	 Quantity – respond with amount 
6.	 Grid – complete a matrix to provide more than one answer

Questionnaire design and testing
We could add to the list above:
1.	 Personal factual attribute question – e.g., age, employment status, qualifications 
2.	 Likert rating scale – strength of response (e.g., strongly agree through strongly disagree) 
indicated against numeric scale of 1 to 5 with a neutral midpoint
3.	 Rating scale – strength of response indicated against verbal scale 
4.	 Rating scale – strength of response indicated against bipolar or self-anchoring numeric scale 
(opposite statements at either end of numeric scale) 
5.	 Semantic differential scales – opposite adjectives at each end of numeric scale 
6.	 Frequency scale – verbal scale or numeric between always and never 
7.	 Fill in the blank (open response)
8.	 Dichotomous choice (e.g. Yes/No, True/False, Agree/Disagree)
9.	 Match pairs 
You may be able to think of more? Remember closed questions are designed to check facts or perceptions, 
confirming information and producing answers which either qualify the respondent in some way, or 
give comparable data across your sample. 
Open question formats include: 
1.	 Open list – number of answers required, type of answer free 
2.	 Open essay – often used as a final option to let respondent comment 
3.	 Personal question about opinion – free answer 
4.	 Personal question about behaviour – free answer 
5.	 Vignette or scenario – question is set in an example context, answer usually open 
See if you can devise a business research question for each of the formats above. It is only by doing 
this, that we get an idea of any problems in wording. Wording of the questions on surveys is one of the 
significant challenges in designing effective questionnaires. Preparing meaningful and carefully thought 
out response sets to the questions is also an important part of survey design.

Questionnaire design and testing
In addition to having an objective for the questionnaire when you begin, you should also start by listing 
what information you want to collect, and then design questions which elicit that information; you also 
need to consider the type of information you want to collect and the level of data your questions will 
provide. For example, you may want to know the age (or income, etc.) of your respondent. You can ask 
that as an open ended question and request they fill in the blank with their actual age (or income), or you 
can design a closed ended question with 5 different ranges of ages (or incomes) which the respondent 
can choose from. While the question is the same, the answers yield very different levels of data which 
will impact the kind of analysis you can perform on the data. Also, when asking more personal questions, 
you may get a more honest answer if ranges are used. But range data will be at the ordinal level of data, 
while asking for actual numbers provides ratio level data. You have to decide what level of data you need. 
Don’t ask for actual numbers if all you are going to do with it is categorize it later on anyway. When 
designing ranges, think about the highest value likely to be in the population. Typically, 5–7 categories 
is standard, so divide the highest number by 5–7 to establish the range which the categories should 
include. Unless you absolutely know the highest value, leave the last range open (if asking age, the last 
category should say “xx or older” rather than xx–yy). If too many respondents fill in just one category 
you probably did not consider this range issue carefully enough! Be sure to collect all the information 
you need, but do not collect information you will not need or use. This is a common problem novice 
survey designers often face.

Questionnaire design and testing
There is another kind of question in many questionnaires and that is a filter question (sometimes a 
whole filter section). Filter questions are used when some parts of the questionnaire are not relevant to 
all respondents. We may use a filter question such as “If your answer is no, please move to question x”. 
Or we can clearly label sections “if x applies to you, please omit this section”. The important thing will 
be clarity and avoiding filters if at all possible, since they are often a cause of error and non-response. 
When designing questionnaires, it is worth referring to a book on this subject by A.N. Oppenheim. The 
second (2000) edition of this classic work (originally written in 1992) includes far more information on 
questionnaires than most of us will need, but discusses specific issues very clearly. 
7.4	
How to design, pilot and administer questionnaires
Remember that questionnaires are not just the self-completion kind sent through the post or email 
or found on the web. Questionnaires are also created for structured interviews and semi-structured 
interviews either face-to-face or conducted over the telephone (we will look at these in detail in the 
chapter on interviewing). Well-designed questions are the skeleton of any good research study. Even 
when we don’t ask them directly of respondents, we often have to prepare them to collect data – for 
example when preparing to conduct participant observation, it will help to have clear questions in mind 
and perhaps some kind of pro-forma for us to complete during the experience. 
Here are twenty tips to avoid question pitfalls: 
1.	 Keep checking back to your research focus – is this question really necessary and relevant? 
2.	 For every question, aim to jot down the maximum number of ways in which you think it can 
be answered – this immediately identifies problems with wording and is even better done by 
someone else for you 
3.	 Check you can answer the question “what do I want to know” for each of your questions. This 
should help to avoid ambiguity 
4.	 Closed questions are easier to use for data but including only closed questions will provide 
you with limited data. Unless you believe you can anticipate everything a respondent will say, 
use some open questions as well. 
5.	 Check for vague terms in the question e.g. often, usually, sometimes, this year, most, few – 
people will have different meanings for these terms so their answers will not necessarily coincide 
with what you intend. 
6.	 If you are asking a “why” question, think about the frame of reference of your respondent – are 
they likely ever to have thought about this “why”? If not, can you make it easier to answer? 
Perhaps offer alternative answers with an “other” category? 
7.	 Check for “leading” questions where you lead a respondent to agree or disagree with something. 
8.	 Have you checked for double-barreled questions? Look for the word “and” in your questions! 
Allow respondents to answer one thing at a time.

Questionnaire design and testing
9.	 Check the questionnaire’s spelling and grammar – both are vital to ensure transmission of 
accurate meaning and maintain researcher credibility. 
10.	Avoid technical words and acronyms (e.g. management jargon such as incremental, optimum, 
marginal, strategic, motivation, ROI [return on investment] etc.) unless you are sure the 
respondents are familiar with them. 
11.	If you are using verbal scales for response e.g. poor, acceptable, good, excellent, check that 
every question using this scale makes sense when answered this way. What if it said “does the 
pay package meet your needs?” the response scale should be adverbial e.g. not at all, to some 
extent, well, extremely well. Otherwise we should rephrase the question. 
12.	Should you use five intervals in a scale or four? Five intervals will encourage a central tendency, 
i.e. respondents find it easier to give a mid-point reply than an extreme reply. So given Very 
poor, Poor, Average, Good, Excellent, there are likely to be a lot of Average answers. Four 
intervals are better as they force respondents to commit themselves on the positive or negative 
side, but should also include a Not Sure or Not Applicable, usually located at one end of the 
scale for ease of coding. For similar reasons, if using a large number of rating questions, 
switch some around (i.e. they should not all be expressed just positively or just negatively) so 
that respondents have to think, rather than running quickly down a ticklist. They will need 
switching back before coding. 
13.	If you are using yes/no or true/false questions, make sure that no-one is likely to want to give an 
answer which is not available (e.g. sometimes). Make sure the question is truly a dichotomous 
choice.
14.	If you are asking for company information e.g. sales or customer profiles etc. – are you sure all 
respondents will be able to answer this? Could you just find this out from a senior manager 
or contact, rather than asking everyone in your sample? 
15.	Are some of your questions actually the kind of things only staff with some considerable 
experience of the company will know? If so, do you have an attribute question to qualify 
whether they have that experience? 
16.	Can you make the layout and format easier to read? 
17.	Have you clearly shown how to respond to each question (e.g. tick or circle (difficult on email 
forms as this requires symbol, a X is easier) and how to return the form? 
18.	Have you checked whether you have authority to send this questionnaire (if it is to an 
organization’s staff etc.)?
19.	Have you piloted this questionnaire, and pre-piloted (an earlier draft stage) if you know you 
will only get one chance to get these questions answered by this sample? 
20.	Have you kept a note of all changes you have made to your questionnaire and why? This will be 
helpful when you are writing up your research method and should remind you of the learning 
you have achieved.

Questionnaire design and testing
There are a number of articles on web-based questionnaires in recent issues of the International Journal 
of Social Research Methodology (Fox, J., Murray, C. et al. 2003; Heerwegh, D., Vanhove, T. et al. 2005) 
and the Electronic Journal of Business Research Methods (McCalla, R.A. 2003). Look through them 
and consider what you believe to be the most important differences between web-based and postal 
questionnaires. We know that the web offers us speed and often ease and convenience of use. We also know 
that some companies offer simple online questionnaire building sites which may be free or involve just a 
small charge (e.g. www.surveymonkey.com) and this can help give a quick questionnaire a professional 
look and offer automatic response summaries. If you are a member of a higher education institution or 
organization which has a professional online survey tool, such as Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), then 
be sure to use this rather than a free version, as your formatting and potential for data analysis will be 
much more professional. 
Survey Monkey and Qualtrics provide a means to both design and deploy your surveys through email, 
the web, and other online portals including mobile devices. Using such online questionnaire and survey 
design resources can help make the survey research process efficient. A note of caution is that resources 
such as these place the ability to conduct a questionnaire or survey into the hands of virtually anyone. 
While these programs make creating questions easy, they do not make the survey design process foolproof. 
Many a bad question, or even entire survey has been deployed by “amateur” researchers using high 
power research tools. And the downside of using these online tools is that they do have some limitations 
regarding the types and layout of your questionnaire.

Questionnaire design and testing
But of course the choice of a web survey or physical print survey (posted or emailed) will always depend 
on the population you are targeting and the context of your research. Clearly some populations will not 
have web access and/or may not like using the web interface. Others, for example people seeking a job 
online, would be ideal candidates for web survey. There is some evidence that if a group to be surveyed 
is offered a choice of online or physical questionnaires, they will respond better to physical print copies if 
these are administered together in one place and time, but better to online questionnaires if not co-located.
7.5	
Questions for self review
1.	 Why do most questionnaires for self-completion have a lot of closed questions? 
2.	 What incentive would it take for you to answer a 20 item questionnaire, a 50 item questionnaire 
and a 100 item questionnaire? Think about your response in relation to how many items you 
might include. 
3.	 What is a Likert scale? What different kinds of scale questions are there? 
4.	 How would you design the category ranges of a question if you were interested in knowing 
the ages of parents of nursery school children versus the age of patients in a nursing home?
5.	 Why should a questionnaire always have a covering letter/email?

1.	 identify the value of secondary data to business research 
2.	 understand what to look for as secondary data and where to find it

8.2	
the value of secondary data to business research
8.2.1	
Broad data groupings available 
Survey secondary data will usually have been analysed for its original purpose and could be a national 
periodic compulsory census, a regular e.g. annual survey or a one-off survey. You should be aware that 
this may not be raw data, i.e. some filtering and data decisions will have had to be made (e.g. coding of 
non-responses, grouping of data etc.). 
8.2.2	
Contextual background 
Much business research will require an awareness of industry, national or sector context (for example if 
you are conducting primary research in a healthcare organization, it will be useful to set the context for 
this by comparing national or international healthcare statistics, or you may be reviewing your local area’s 
labour force and want to see how this relates to your country’s or other country’s labour force statistics). 
If you would like to try out a search for some international labour force statistics on the web, then 
conduct the following experiment. Try Google first and note down what you can find in 10 minutes. 
Then try Eurostat (the European Union statistics website) and note down how long it takes to find labour 
force statistics for member countries and any other issues which arise. Then try www.esds.ac.uk which 
should give you access to OECD Labour Force statistics. You may also want to try the US Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov) and select “international comparisons”. Note down how long this takes 
and what kind of information seems to be available. This experiment should give you a clear idea of 
how complex some secondary data can be and the types of data, particularly statistical data, which is 
easily available to the researcher.

Using secondary data
If you are likely to use such sources, think about: 
1.	 How the different sources compared 
2.	 How long did it took to use each source Would this be easier next time
3.	 How the labour force statistics compared? Were you finding similar statistics
8.3.3	
Quick and cheap data 
Secondary data is often cost-free and, especially if it can be gained over the web or from your local / 
university library, this should be quick to find. Secondary data can be classified as proprietary or public 
access. Proprietary data is that which has restricted access, whether it be protected from use by others 
without permission, or whether it is accessed through a subscription to a service providing the data. 
When using proprietary secondary data it is important to be sure you have the right permission to use the 
data. As students enrolled at the university, often time you have access to such proprietary data through 
your university library. For example, Lexis-Nexis, Hoovers and Mergent-online are private sources to 
extraordinary amounts of business intelligence and secondary data. However, for example if you just go 
to “mergent.com” you will be taken to its website, but in order to access its databases, you will have to 
have a subscription and login to the service. If your university (or public) library holds a subscription 
to Mergent, you would access it through the library’s gateway to these databases. Often, students are 
not aware of the sources of private domain business intelligence to which they have subscription access 
through their place of study. Take time to visit your university library (either online or in person) to 
explore the possibilities. Additionally, many businesses often have subscriptions to such databases for its 
employees to access and use. As knowledge-based professionals, it’s important for you to know where 
to find and how to use such business intelligence and data to assist you in performing your job, and in 
helping make your employer successful.
8.2.4	
Longitudinal and cross-cultural data source 
Much national and international data is collected on a periodic basis over time, so allows longitudinal 
research studies – not normally possible through primary research in view of cost and time constraints. 
Similarly cross-cultural studies can use large survey data, when conducting this as primary research is 
particularly complex. For more information on cross-national studies and some of the problems which 
can arise see Lynn’s article on this in International Journal of Social Research Methodology (Lynn, P. 
2003), available fulltext online.

Meta-analysis made possible 
Meta-analysis (conducting research on other people’s research, therefore at one removed from it) can 
also produce surprising fresh insights – partly on the basis that at this perspective it may be easier to 
see “big picture” patterns. Meta-analysis also involves the process of trying to integrate the quantitative 
and qualitative results of numerous research studies employing various methodologies and designs; all 
of which are on a similar topic or thesis. Meta-analysis (opposed to a literature review) seeks to draw 
more comprehensive conclusions and often involves quantitative methods of data analysis and synthesis 
of these multiple, but common-topic research studies. Meta-analysis operates under the Gestalt principle 
of “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.
8.3	
What to look for as secondary data and where to find it
8.3.1	
what is secondary data? 
Secondary data is data, which the researcher did not collect for themselves directly from respondents or 
subjects. This means that secondary data was not collected with the researcher’s purpose and objectives 
in mind. It may have been collected 
•	 by other researchers, perhaps in the process of academic studies (could be available in journal 
articles, or published doctoral theses or conference proceedings) or 
•	 in the process of normal operations (e.g. an organization’s “grey” material – information 
it publishes internally such as sales figures, information about product launches, company 
minutes etc., or an individual’s personal diary or learning log) 
•	  by institutions, whose job is to collect data (e.g. government or regional offices of statistics 
and information, international bodies whose purpose is information collection e.g. OECD or 
academic, media and professional bodies set up for the purpose of collecting information and 
data directly and from these government or international bodies). 
For many business research studies, especially qualitative ones, it will be difficult to find exactly the kind 
of data needed, since it is unlikely you would be doing the research were it not for the fact that it hadn’t 
been done before! So most studies will need to design collection methods for primary data. However, 
there is a vast amount of secondary data out there, much of it surprisingly accessible over the web, which 
may save us considerable time or give us a useful benchmark or context in which to set up our research 
design or a way of triangulating our results. 
Where your research relates to a national or international level of operation, it is likely that national 
and international statistics will form part or all of your study, since these studies take time and money 
to achieve. Much of this kind of data. e.g. census data will be available free over the web or free from 
a variety of Government offices. Secondary data may be documentary, survey or multiple source, i.e. a 
mix of documents and surveys.

8.4	
the disadvantages of using secondary data in business research
8.4.1	
Difference of purpose 
Because the original researchers had a different purpose and constraints from your current project, 
there may be inconsistencies or elements of the research which are not compatible with your own. This 
could include currency, terminology, samples, market changes, boundary changes, new discoveries or 
technology since the research was carried out etc. Additionally, secondary data may not be in the form 
in which you would like to use it. As a result, secondary data may need to be transformed and “recoded” 
from its original format. For example, you may find specific secondary data on the “subjects” of your study; 
however you need to know “annual income” but it may be found as “monthly income”, in which case you 
will need to multiply by 12 in order to use it in the form you require. Or in doing international business 
research, you may have company financial data reported in the currency of each country but will need 
to convert it into a common currency appropriate for the audience to which your research is directed. 
8.4.2	
Cost or access constraint 
For secondary data, this problem arises mostly when searching for corporate data, either directly from 
companies or via agencies for market research data such as Mintel and KeyNote. In some cases the latter 
may be accessible through university libraries – it is always worth asking. 
8.4.3	
Aggregation and presentation of data 
Other researchers, working for other research purposes, will often aggregate data in a way, which is not 
useful for your own research, for example showing regional rather than city data, or street rather than 
household data, or not disaggregating by gender. The presentation of data will depend on the purpose of 
the original research too – especially if the research is done for a media purpose, where headline stories 
sell media. There may be some apparent distortion in the data because of this.

Using secondary data
You should find the section “Census and Sensitivity” on your screen. This is a four page section with 
some online questions about the UK Census and issues about the actual data counted. Work through 
the questions (there are Hint buttons if you find the questions difficult). This activity should help you to 
understand the constraints which surround population census data. This can be very difficult to compare 
across countries and over time, although that is the reason it is collected. The reasons for this include 
the inevitable shift in question focus over time, and changes in technology which mean the format of 
questions and the flexibility of response changes over time too. Despite this, census data is a major helpful 
source of general population statistics and is collected in most countries of the world. So when you are 
trying to discuss a statistical background to a research issue, this can be a very useful source, provided 
you are aware of constraints of comparison. 
8.4.4	
Data quality 
From this book, you will be getting an idea of the attention to detail and careful planning and thought, 
which goes into good quality research. This is one thing which is difficult to check when using secondary 
data. Instead, the best we can usually do is to ensure the credibility and professionalism of the source 
institution, rather than the data. Be particularly careful when using secondary data from internet sources, 
where organizations are not known to you, as anyone can put up false data on the web without challenge. 
This also leads us to be particularly cautious about references sources.

Using secondary data
A further step in assessing data quality will be to critically evaluate the research methods used to collect 
the secondary data. It is often reasonable to contact the data source to establish their methods, if you are 
considering using their publicly available data. Government sources usually publish detailed technical 
background alongside the data to enable you to interpret the data appropriately. 
8.4.5	
Measurement validity 
Think back to our discussions on epistemology – we cannot expect secondary data to be some kind of 
“truth”. The data will reflect the purposes, and pre-conceptions, of the original researchers. It would also 
be useful to think back here to your reading on the taxonomy of facts (Bannister, F. 2005). 
8.4.6	
Data coverage and cleansing
Does the secondary data cover the exact population in which you are interested? Are there any unwanted 
exclusions or inclusions, which may affect the way you use this data? Because secondary data was not 
originally designed to be used by you, it often needs to be “cleansed” for secondary usage. Cleansing 
involves eliminating extraneous data which may have been included in the original data which is of no 
use to you, as well as performing the necessary “data transformations” needed to get the original data 
in the form which you need it to be in (as discussed earlier).
8.4.7	
Data use 
Unless you are simply going to quote from the secondary data as background information, you are likely 
to want to download or enter secondary data to run statistical analysis of some kind. Some data will be 
in a format ready for this – e.g. from www.bized.co.uk/timeweb. Some may not. 
8.5 Big Data – This is a buzzword in the 21st century as massive increases in data collected from business 
transactions – indeed any transaction – over the web can be stored and analysed. This data might come 
from a wide array of sources such as financial transactions, accounts, customer behaviour, buying patterns, 
medical records, surveillance, as well as social media sources like Facebook and Twitter. This data does 
not come in simple formats, but in semi-structured or unstructured formats such as Web clickstreams, 
logs, machine data, location data and of course text. The sheer volume of such data makes it hard to see 
how to derive value, but this is what data analytics is all about: mining large and complex data sets to 
find information at a level which is helpful for better decision making in business. 
However, don’t be put off. Fundamentally, big data is about applying statistical understanding to wide 
and messy data sets. It uses the same tools we have already discussed but generally employs software to 
spot patterns and trends, and produces output in user-friendly formats such as infographics and data 
visualisations. Business organisations such as eBay, Walmart, Amazon and Facebook make a virtue 
from the huge volumes of data their business generates, running systems which aim to identify trends 
(descriptive statistics) and relationships (inductive statistics) in the data for business use.

Using secondary data
If you wish to access some of the outputs from such organisations, take care to find the assumptions on 
which data is collected and processed. For example, Twitter can make data available, but rarely will it 
actually allow anyone outside the business to see the core data (called FIREHOSE) on which its sample 
data is based. Linked data sets tend to be error prone and errors at this scale can be seriously prejudicial 
to the results. The other problem here is that data requires context to make it meaningful. Just crunching 
vast quantities of data together may be less than helpful without clearly tracking source contexts.
8.6	
Questions for self review
1.	 Why bother with primary research when you can use secondary data? 
2.	 What are the potential problems of using national survey data? 
3.	 What is a meta-analysis? How does it differ from Big Data?
4.	 Where would you be able to find a range of OECD survey data reports online?

Key issues in qualitative data analysis
Clearly qualitative research is a different kettle of fish from a quantitative study – we explored the 
differences in earlier chapters. At first sight, it may seem that qualitative research is more difficult to 
pin down, less precise. In fact, qualitative methods are usually governed by clear rules and offer a way 
of exploring issues, which cannot easily be expressed by number. 
An article by Rowlands (2005) offers a detailed justification of a qualitative approach to research on 
SMEs and training practice. This is a useful read to discover the steps taken in justifying a qualitative 
method. Qualitative methods are increasingly accepted in social science and business research as this 
branch of enquiry differentiates itself from a scientific positivist paradigm. Human organizations and 
human behaviour are difficult to hold still and isolate, since they change constantly and can offer different 
dimensions of themselves to different audiences. Think about the function of Public Relations and the 
different faces of an organization which may be shown to shareholders, customers, staff, suppliers for 
example. So it rarely makes sense to look only at numerical measured evidence when trying to understand 
what is going on in an organization or other group of people. This is not to rule out quantitative study – 
naturally there are financial data and other quantitative data which can be established and monitored 
around business organizations and which will be of vital importance in their study and their day-to-day 
management. But there is also clearly a place for perception studies, looking at what people think or feel 
is going on at work, as this will also affect day-to-day and strategic long-term practice in organizations. 
Some key differences between quantitative and qualitative method are shown below (Bryman & Bell, 
2011) Some of these distinctions are arguable – for example “structured” vs “unstructured”, macro vs 
micro. Also, we should bear in mind that mixed quantitative and qualitative methods can usefully be 
used, where elements of both approaches can be used both to triangulate results and to develop richer 
pictures still of the phenomenon under investigation.

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
It is helpful to reflect on the influence of the researcher in qualitative research. As we have already 
discussed, there is a researcher influence to some extent in all research and analysis, however qualitative 
methods are more likely to suggest subjectivity. For this reason, it is essential to reflect on ways in which 
your qualitative data and analysis could be affected by your standpoint and contextual understanding, as 
well as your expectations of the research, and to make this explicit within your research report. It will 
also be necessary to be very clear and explicit about the method of research and analysis adopted, just 
as we must be in quantitative research. 
9.3	
the range of qualitative research methods applicable to research topics
9.3.1	
Principal Qualitative methods 
Action research 
Appreciative Inquiry
Case study 
Ethnographic research / Participant observation 
Focus groups 
Interviews – structured, semi-structured, unstructured 
Life history research 
Participant diaries 
Structured observation 
Some quick web searching will give you plenty of information on these different qualitative methods. 
Action research for example will involve the researcher as an active participant in the situation under 
study. As an actor in the organization in which they may be employed, an action researcher seeks to 
explore and understand the world of which they are a part, and action research can help all involved in that 
business situation to understand better what is happening through a time of radical change – for example 
business restructuring, redundancy etc. German Psychologist Kurt Lewin is known to be the “father of 
action research”. He noted that action research involved a 3-step process of planning, taking action, and 
then reflecting on the results, feeding back into its next cycle. It’s a cycle of continuous improvement. 
Case study research will involve more than one way of deriving data about the case or organization/
unit under study. This may include collecting and analysing documents, talking to people, survey 
data, participant observation, consumer research and any other data collection techniques which offer 
qualitative information about the case. A case study investigates a single subject at a more micro level; 
that is the unit of analysis is just one subject, whether it is a person, an organization or institution. Think 
of a case study as one in which the “N” is just one (“N=1”). The intention of the case study is Gestalt in 
nature. A paper by Walsham (2006) discusses the nature of interpretative case studies and methods for 
carrying them out in Information systems, business and other areas of social sciences. Another useful 
source reference is Yin: Case Study Research – Design and Methods which is now in its fifth edition 
(published by SAGE publications).

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
A more recent development in qualitative research methodologies is that of Appreciative Inquiry 
(Cooperrider, D.L. & Srivastva, S., 1987). As a problem solving technique, Appreciative Inquiry (AI) 
focuses on what is ‘right” about situation or condition rather than the traditional approach to look at what 
is wrong. The AI process involves a 4 step methodology. 1) Discover or focus in on what is working well 
in a system, 2) Dream or envision other process that would work well 3) Design by focusing in on one of 
the dreams that would work best in the situation and 4) Deploy or implement the proposed improvement.
Ethnographic research comes from the study of anthropology, where “tribes” are lived in and observed 
for purposes of research. This kind of research will raise ethical issues, especially about the impact of 
the research on the life and behaviour of the group studied. The presence of a researcher in any group is 
likely to affect how people behave to one another. In a less deep and sustained involvement, participant 
observation may offer similar researcher impact on results.
Action research, case studies and ethnographic research tends to be more naturalistic in its process, in 
that there is no direct intervention or artificiality as found when quantitative, and even other forms of 
qualitative research such as focus groups, interviews etc. are conducted.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
9.3.2	
Approaches to Qualitative analysis 
Analysis method
Outline definitions
Analytic induction 
Systematic analysis of text or other qualitative data to build categories and sub-
categories within the data – attempting to construct a rich picture from data.
Cognitive mapping 
Determining how individuals construct mental models, often using visual or spatial 
means (diagrams, pictures) to produce a map of relationships between concepts as 
understood by the subject.
Data display and analysis 
Analyzing data by first reducing qualitative data to a simple set of ideas, then 
displaying those ideas in order to draw and check conclusions from the data.
Discourse analysis 
Analysing language used by subjects to determine how the world of a subject is 
constructed through the use of language.
Feminist research 
Seeing reality through the perspective of gender. Feminist research tries to revise how 
organisations are understood, challenging male-oriented values and paradigms.
Grounded theory 
Inductive approach to building theory from data, usually from interviews and 
observations. Various versions exist, but the principal method is to code phenomena 
within the data (e.g. an interview transcript) and to repeatedly revisit the data in order 
to refine and “saturate” the categories derived, before meaningful theory can be built.
Historiography 
Involves the study of historical method, for example when revisiting an event, this 
would mean analyzing the epistemological position taken when versions of the event 
are written and challenging the authenticity of such positions.
Narrative analysis 
Collecting and analyzing qualitative data without fragmenting it – this method 
preserves the narrative/story of the data to maintain a sense of time, place and 
sequence in the data.
Phenomenography 
Seeks to describe the way different people view a phenomenon, usually based on 
interview data taking an interpretivist approach The aim is to develop an intense 
picture of the phenomenon by defining the outcome space (different people’s views 
of the same thing) and investigating relationships within that space.
Phenomenology 
Approaches social phenomena from the perspective that they are socially 
constructed. Concerned with discerning meaning within the phenomena.
Template analysis 
Creating a hierarchy of categories from the data and using this as a template to 
explore qualitative data examples
These approaches may overlap in some cases: for example grounded theory is a very detailed 
iterative method of, usually, interview transcript analysis and thus involves some similar activities to 
phenomenography, where such transcripts may also be interrogated by the researcher in a very detailed 
and iterative way. The aim in both cases is to dig into the text to look for categories or themes in the 
data which may be built into rich ideas or theories. Both are examples of inductive research i.e. theory 
building rather than theory testing.

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
While these different methods of qualitative analysis are very distinct – any research methods textbook 
or website will give full descriptions – they all involve a rigorous attempt to look at qualitative data 
(descriptions, discussions, activities, ideas presented verbally, audio-visually or in text) which offer a 
range of research interpretations. It may be the case that different researchers using the same analysis 
method on the same data could find different ideas and theories. They will be interpretations and subject 
to debate and challenge. Qualitative analysis must therefore be as rigorous and transparent in method 
as possible, to allow readers of such research to understand how conclusions and findings are achieved. 
They may not be exactly reproducible, as would be expected in experimental science, but that does not 
invalidate such results. The outcomes of qualitative research, like those of quantitative research, may be 
disputed; which is why it is vital to detail the methods used for collecting and analysing the data, and 
to explain as clearly as possible the researcher’s own paradigm or philosophy about research, so that 
readers may understand where the ideas come from and how they may be filtered by the researcher. 
9.3.3	
What are the key operations required in qualitative data analysis? 
•	 Where data is derived from interviews – individual or group, structured or semi-structured or 
unstructured – there will be a need to transcribe the recording of that interview before analysis. 
This brings its own problems of time, cost, method and detail. 
•	 Development of themes, categories or ideas (from the literature (which may then be used to 
offer a hypothesis for testing in the data- deductive approach) or from the data itself (inductive 
approach). This is often referred to as thematic analysis.
•	 Unitising, coding or finding units of meaning within the data, which relate to or add to or 
amend the categories 
•	 Constant comparative method leading to saturation of categories – this terminology comes 
from grounded theory but the activity is not confined to this approach; a constant iterative 
process of checking how the data meanings fit the categories or themes 
•	 Understanding the variation and role of language as an intermediary in the communication 
of ideas 
•	 In many cases, the production of researcher summaries, log books, contextual notes to help 
provide further explanatory detail to transcripts or observations

how qualitative data can be prepared for analysis
In most cases, this will involve some kind of transcription. Although simply taking notes of observations, 
and in some cases in interviews, may be sufficient, a transcript is important for conversations in which 
the researcher wishes to play some part, so that they are not required to both write notes and conduct 
an interview or group discussion. However, recent advances in computer software provide programs 
which automatically transcribe voice to text with considerable accuracy. This has eliminated many of 
the administrative inefficiencies in conducting interviews and focus groups. (You will need to be sure to 
observe legal and ethical implications and obtain permission and / or authorized consent when recording 
and transcribing input from your subjects). Nuance’s Dragon 13 is one such program benefitting from

This will mean gaining agreement for recording, finding a suitable instrument for recording and 
transcription and undertaking the transcription itself. Suitable recording equipment will not be too 
intimidating for the interviewee(s), will be reliable (!), will have a reliable power supply, will have a 
microphone which can pick up every speaker clearly including the researcher, and will produce adequate 
sound quality for transcription. Remember that interviewees may begin by speaking clearly and loudly 
as they are aware of the recording, but voice tone and pitch may soften later, so set the recording level 
high. Always test the recorder at the start of an interview.

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Increasingly, digital voice recorders are being used for this purpose as they are small, relatively inexpensive 
and can record longer sessions than many audio tapes. You may wish to use both a conventional audio 
tape recorder and a digital recorder to make quite sure a useful recording is made. Digital recorders 
are useful as interviews can be played back to the researcher through MP3 players or computers with 
speakers, removing the need for sitting by a tape player. Do not be tempted to voice record without 
gaining full agreement from the interviewees (as small digital recorders are now able to do this), clearly 
this data cannot be used ethically if collected without consent. Beware voice-activated equipment (which 
switches off when there is nothing being said) as this can lose definition owing to the transition from 
off to on when a voice is heard. 
It can be possible to pay someone to transcribe interview data for you, which can be helpful if there is a 
great deal of interview data. However, this does deny the researcher the opportunity of getting to know 
the interview in great detail during transcription; sometimes it is preferable to do this personally – or 
it may be the only alternative available. 
When transcribing, maintain a context sheet to record non-verbal interventions or interruptions, as this 
data may affect how the transcript is understood. Transcripts should ideally be double-spaced to allow 
for coding and other notes to be made on the document. Decide rules for referring to individuals in 
the interview (actual names are not usually typed up for reasons of confidentiality). You will also need 
to decide how to type up repetitions of words and phrases, as this is common in speech patterns but 
usually adds little to the data. Bear in mind that a good typist can take 4–8 hours to type up one hour 
of interview, this is a very time-consuming process. 
Respondent validation: it may be helpful to send transcripts for checking by the interviewees. This helps 
to build credibility in the transcripts, but is not always acceptable to the interviewee. At minimum, 
you the researcher must check every transcript against the recording, as it is easy to make mistakes in 
transcription (sometimes a mind-numbing process) yet such errors may lead to considerable effects 
on analysis.

computer based methods for qualitative data analysis
Computer aided qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) is increasingly available, though like voice 
recognition software, this will not necessarily reduce analysis time by a great deal and will not be that 
straightforward.

Qualitative research methods: collecting 
and analysing qualitative data
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
CAQDAS can produce quantitative data from qualitative methods, for example by producing frequency 
data on particular events, words etc. However, its main use is the qualitative analysis of such data as 
interview transcripts or narratives. They do this by organising the data, providing instant access to all 
data once entered, searching and retrieving particular words or phrases. One such CAQDAS program is 
NVivo. NVivo, like other CADQAS programs, classifies, sorts and arranges prose, and provides output 
which can be integrated into other software platforms such as MSWord, Excel, or SPSS. The program 
allows the researcher to analyze large amounts of prose-based information and identify trends and themes 
which are extracted. NVivo helps those doing qualitative research by organizing and analyzing prose 
information for the researcher to gain insight on, interpret, construct conclusions, and take action on.
If NVivo is not available as a package on your computer, then visit the website of its supplier  
www.qsrinternational.com and download a demonstration of the software to investigate what it will do 
and how it feels.

Practical issues in conducting interviews,  
focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
10.2	
Practical considerations relating to participant observation
10.2.1	
Ethnography or participant observation? 
Both ethnography and participant observation involve submersion of the researcher into the context under 
study. As mentioned in the previous chapter, ethnographic research has a more social anthropological feel 
and may focus more on business “tribes” and organizational settings such as departments and functions, 
or different national sites of operation. The focus will be on the community described and its symbols, 
culture, interactions, rituals, language etc. Participant observation will be used to allow the researcher 
direct experience of a specific situation or event, perhaps working in a factory or office setting during a 
transition period. However, in some texts, the two terms will be used interchangeably, so when discussing 
practical issues, we can classify them broadly together. 
10.2.2	
Access 
Both approaches involve intense involvement of the researcher in the field, in order to feel like an “insider” 
and try to understand and explain what that feels like. This is usually difficult to do in the short term, 
so a time commitment to the research will be the first hurdle. In some cases, where a researcher is also 
employed in the organization being studied, this should not prove too problematic (but does raise other 
issues of covert research to be covered next). Where the researcher has no other role in the organization 
being studied, there will probably be protracted negotiations to allow this kind of long-term access. 
Think about how you might gain access to an organization for this kind of study? Letters? Emails? 
Contacts? How do you convince them of your credibility and trustworthiness? 
10.2.3	
Covert or overt research? 
If research is undertaken covertly, without authority, then problems of access and of reactivity disappear. 
However, a number of others appear instead. For example the sheer practical difficulty of taking detailed 
research notes when you are meant to be working on the job! Also being unable to use other research 
methods during this period such as interviews. There is anxiety about possible discovery of the researcher 
role and activities, anxiety which is well-founded, since if the covert research is discovered, there is a 
strong chance the study will have to be abandoned before completion. 
Most of all, however there is a problem of Ethics, since participants in the research will not have the 
opportunity for informed consent and their privacy is violated. This can damage the research and 
researcher if it is discovered, but can also damage the reputation of research in general amongst those 
whose trust was betrayed. 
Is there a happy medium? For example, is it possible to have senior management authority but not to 
divulge your intentions to colleagues? What kind of difficulties might this cause? Or could the broad 
purpose of “research” be discussed openly, but the specific focus and question be kept secret?

Practical issues in conducting interviews,  
focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Whichever conclusion you reach, your research report will have to show clear details of the overt or 
covert nature of your research, and there would need to be very good reasons for a covert approach. 
Think about a scenario in which you would be tempted to try covert participant observation. For example, 
suppose your place of work was threatened by relocation to a new venue and you wanted to study the 
effects of this move on the team’s performance. As part of the team, you are now in a double role – 
team-worker and researcher. Think about the challenges and constraints this imposes on you. You want 
to use covert observation because you feel that if you tell the team you are watching their reactions and 
conversations, they will either reject you as a team-worker or will change their behaviour because they 
are being watched. Could they get to know about your role as researcher somehow? That might seriously 
affect your chances of continued employment in the team, since, even with your manager’s agreement 
to the research, your colleagues may feel they cannot trust you again. 
10.2.4	
Relationship-building 
Whatever approach is taken to participant observation, the researcher will need to develop skills of 
relationship-building, 
•	 to allay colleagues’ suspicions about being a representative or spy from top management, 
•	 to maintain a degree of objectivity while in the organization (rather than helping to affect the 
very relationships being studied e.g. a particular view of management or other functions or 
companies) and finally 
•	 to develop key informants who can be used to provide broad organizational background and 
check out stories you are told, or help you to find appropriate people to get to know. 
For example, a recent student conducted a study on flexible working in her own organization. As a 
representative of HR, her role actually precluded the hearing of much gossip and informal talk, as HR 
could be seen as “the enemy” in relation to contracts negotiation. However, her gender, together with 
strong interpersonal skills, enabled her to get to know about unofficial flexible working through informal 
networks built on trust over time. This research ultimately exposed serious double standards in the way 
flexible working was represented by some managers in the company. 
10.2.5	
Roles for participant observers 
Bryman and Bell (2011) discuss research by Gold in 1958 setting out four roles for participant observers: 
complete participant (covert observer), participant-as-observer (complete participant but overt researcher 
too), observer-as-participant (primary role is researcher but can participate in work) and complete 
observer (no participation in work and little communication with those observed). Further views of the 
different possible roles are offered by Gans and Bryman & Bell. The sense of exchange is usually helpful, 
since research data can be gained in exchange for consultancy advice, survey work or straight labour. 
Perhaps the biggest temptation is to “go native” ie to become fully absorbed into the perspective of the 
participant role, and thus to lose the objectivity of the researcher role.

10.3	
Practical issues relating to interviews
10.3.1	
Structured, semi-structured, unstructured 
If an interview is fully structured in format, does this mean it is quantitative research? To some extent 
yes, in that clear questions are asked in a consistent way, similar to the administration of a questionnaire 
by telephone. However the mere fact that the interviewer and interviewee are face-to-face brings another 
dimension to the research method. When we can see our interviewees, we introduce the concept of 
non-verbal communication – not just from them (which helps us understand more about them) but 
also from us – which can steer or emphasise certain areas, mislead or explain further items which would 
otherwise be misunderstood or left blank and so on. 
Semi-structured interviews will be based on a question guide, the contents of which will always be asked 
of respondents. However, since this is not fully structured, the interviewee is allowed to go where they 
want with the questions and to divert to other things which interest them. Since the focus of a qualitative 
interview is the interviewee, not the interviewer, this is fine. 
Unstructured or in-depth interviews can go right off the point – and that may be the point, i.e. to discover 
much more about the interviewee by what they say and think, than how they answer specific questions.

Practical issues in conducting interviews,  
focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
The interviewer’s role is to manage the process (e.g. the time if a particular duration has been promised, 
the key questions are asked and the conversation stays broadly around the research question). The 
interviewee can be subject to very few constraints. 
Many of the issues we raised around the design of questionnaires in an earlier session apply here to 
questions used in interviews (for example no leading questions or double questions). Where some are 
prepared in advance, it is advisable to give a copy to the interviewee in advance if possible, so that rather 
than “whatever comes into their head at the time”, the interviewer will have the benefit of a reflective 
response. Some structured questions in an interview can help to provide consistency where multiple 
cases are studied or where more than one interviewer is used. 
10.3.2	
The issue of time 
When setting up an interview, time booked will take on great importance to the organization and the 
individual, who will be trying to fit this interview in around other duties of the day. However, it is 
normally the case that, once the interview has started, the interviewer will find difficulty in stopping 
the interview, as the interviewee enjoys the experience and begins to use it for personal reflection or 
simply the enjoyment of discussing a work issue with an adult in a way they cannot do with colleagues. 
From the perspective of planning, especially if carrying out several interviews in one visit, the interview 
period should be realistic but not too long, whereas a considerable margin of time should be allowed 
between interviews in case of expected over-run. 
As with any work interview, including a selection interview, it is vital that the visitor to the organization 
(the researcher) turns up on time and in time to begin at the agreed start time, after getting to the 
right place and setting up and testing the recording equipment. So arriving at least 10 minutes early is 
usually helpful. 
10.3.3	
The interview guide 
Preparing key questions in advance is very important if you aim to both achieve your research outcomes 
and be consistent and professional in your approach to interviewing. However, being over-dependent on 
the pre-prepared interview questions can be dangerous. A professional interviewer is genuinely interested 
in the interviewee’s perspective and so will flex the questions to follow new directions suggested by the 
interviewee. Flexibility will make each interview more enjoyable to conduct, rather than feeling slavishly 
controlled by the pre-set guide. Finally, there is a common tendency for an interviewee to anticipate 
later questions, often without any prompts from the interviewer. It will be important to allow them to 
go there, rather than saying “I wonder if we could leave that point as it comes up later.” Inevitably this 
will cause the interviewee and interviewer to forgot what was just said, so you probably won’t get it later.

focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
However, if later questions are covered early on, don’t worry about running out of questions. Confident 
interviewers, by demonstrating empathy and genuine regard for the interviewee, can always facilitate 
further discussion by simple prompts such as “can you tell me more about…?” “that’s an interesting point, 
I hadn’t thought of that, so what exactly do you mean by…”, “I’m not sure I have fully understood, can 
you explain that a little further…or give me an example?”. (Such questions assume you have not run out 
of time, and the initial questions are all answered.) 
10.3.4	
Interview behaviour 
Research cited in Bryman and Bell (2011) by Kvale suggests that an interviewer should be:
•	 Knowledgeable 
•	 Structuring 
•	 Clear 
•	 Gentle 
•	 Sensitive 
•	 Open 
•	 Steering 
•	 Critical 
•	 Remembering 
•	 Interpreting 
They also add the adjectives: balanced and ethically sensitive to the list. To this list, we can add interview 
competencies suggested by Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2012): 
•	 Opening the interview 
•	 Using appropriate language 
•	 Questioning 
•	 Listening 
•	 Testing and summarising understanding 
•	 Recognising and dealing with difficult participants 
•	 Recording data

10.3.5	
After the interview 
Urgent action is needed to make notes about what happened. These are contextual notes, which will 
later shed much light on the event. You might note down personal impressions of how it went, where it 
happened, specific comments on the outcomes, the setting in which it took place, the state of mind of 
the interviewee from your current perspective etc. It will also be necessary to arrange to transcribe the 
interview from the recording as quickly as possible. Within a day or so, it is easy to remember what an 
interviewee was trying to express, even if the recording is not good. Later on, this will become very difficult. 
You may wish to search for an article on interviewing (Carter, J. 2004) which offers some useful ideas 
about the practical challenges. 
10.4	
Practical issues relating to focus groups
A focus group method is a focused group interview. There will be several participants, the researcher as 
facilitator and a method of recording what is said, preferably video recording, as audio can be difficult to 
follow when several people are speaking. Video recording will also give much richer contextual evidence 
about how people interact. However resistance to video recording is much greater than audio recording.

Practical issues in conducting interviews,  
focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
Another key difference with a focus group is that there is usually a specific topic on which discussion 
is to be held, rather than a whole series of topics. The point of interviewing in this way is to explore the 
joint construction of meaning around a specific topic and to see how group dynamics and interaction 
work in this process. 
Focus groups are not easy to run, although get easier with practice. Focus groups can be creative places, 
but can also be full of challenge and conflict – this needs a light touch of management from the researcher, 
only to ensure good standards of communication and respect are encouraged, not to stop conflict since 
this can be a productive source of creativity and meaning development. Issues can surface in a much 
freer way in a focus group than in an individual interview, and can be considered a more naturalistic 
context for testing and developing ideas. 
In order to decide how many focus groups to hold and who should attend, some of the sampling issues 
discussed earlier should be discussed, such as stratified or snowball sampling. For example, are there 
variables, which must be represented in focus group membership (e.g. different departments, levels of 
work, length of experience etc.) – this may increase the number of groups held. Broadly however, focus 
groups can continue to be held until the ideas and themes raised become familiar and can be anticipated 
by the researcher (saturation of categories). To some extent, feasibility and cost/time issues will also 
dictate number of groups held. 
Each individual focus group should consist of participants of a rather homogenous grouping. Then, 
collectively, all focus groups pertaining to a common theme can be integrated to sort of differences and 
similarities among the groups. For example, an organization may wish to determine the “organizational 
climate” among its employees. Several individual focus groups would be necessary. One may consist of 
“rank and file” / hourly employees, one group would consist of supervisors, one of middle management, 
and one of upper level executives. Mixing employees of different ranks in a single focus group is possible 
but can inhibit or contaminate the information collected. Similarly, a marketing department may wish 
to conduct a series of focus groups on customer preferences. Stratifying their customers against key 
demographics and creating focus group sessions for each of these demographics would be necessary. 
Homogeneity among individuals in any one focus group is particularly helpful. 
Size of groups will depend on practical factors, including size of available rooms, but ideally six to eight 
will be the easiest number to manage. While attendance may be easy to control within an organization, 
inter-organizational studies will prove harder to schedule, with no-shows a common feature if people 
have to travel to attend the focus group.

Practical issues in conducting interviews,  
focus groups, participant observation
An introduction to  
Business Research Methods
The facilitator role varies greatly in focus groups, partly depending on the understanding of the process 
by participants. Too much control from the facilitator will make it difficult for a free flowing discussion 
to construct meaning and reveal new insights. Too little control from the facilitator may lead to lack of 
time discipline and the ignoring of some of the key issues. Some greater control is usually helpful at the 
outset, in setting ground rules for the session and explaining that the facilitator does have the right to 
intervene for time or agenda reasons, or perhaps to request an explanation. Once this is set up, the group 
can be encouraged to warm up on its own, and will soon get going, provided they trust the researcher. 
Where steering is needed, the facilitator can then intervene as needed. 
Analysis of the focus group is done once the focus group is completed and the recordings are transcribed, 
and evaluated. Hyden and Bulow (2003) have produced a useful account of focus group methodology 
which may help you to review this approach.

2.	 How could you adapt a semi-structured interview process to be conducted by email? 
3.	 What do you think would be your biggest challenge in conducting research interviews? What 
could you do about this? 
4.	 Why do you think focus groups are so widely used to test new products and new policy ideas?

Forecasting trends
11.2	
Why forecasting is not widely covered in the business research 
methods literature 
Surprisingly few research methods textbooks contain sections on forecasting trends. Why surprising? 
Because, in business, this is a key activity. We can see that the main business of a researcher is to look 
backwards and try to see what was happening in a particular situation involving particular variables 
and people. If research is rigorous, then it may be possible to apply lessons from the past to a current 
situation. But it is not seen as the job of an academic researcher to try to predict the future. Attempts to 
do this are found only in concluding paragraphs of research articles, and they will often be suggesting 
more research in what appear to be developing trends. The Makridakis et al book mentioned above 
remains one of the seminal works on forecasting.
This is not coy. It is simply because predicting and forecasting trends is a very risky business, and rigorous 
research aims to avoid very high risk strategies. Yet people do, of course, predict trends. Management 
gurus and writers frequently aim to identify what is about to happen in business. If we see them as credible 
people, we may be persuaded by their predictions. But reality often proves them wrong. Some predictions 
in business will be about the next wonder product. New Product Development is always highly risky but 
is engaged in order to develop profit streams, deal with product life cycles and develop businesses. The 
risk is clear if we think about the current split between companies developing two different technologies 
for enhanced DVD performance. In early 2007, the market was impossible to call – would we be buying 
High Performance or Blue? Some companies are producing equipment compatible with both systems to 
avoid what happened when the last major split in this market caused the death of Betamax video systems 
in favour of VHS. Now in 2014 these physical video playback media are being replaced with internet-
delivered video through a variety of sources. Could this all have been predicted? If so, how? Read on.
Surely we can do better when forecasting something we know about – such as next year’s company sales 
figures? The evidence shows us that in fact we are poor at predicting even figures with which we are 
intimately involved and which directly affect our company’s future. To start with, we confuse personal 
views and impacts with professional forecasts. If we ask a sales person to predict the level of her/his 
sales next year, that prediction will be partly based on market knowledge, partly on protecting their 
own position in the company, partly on an estimate of the outcomes of getting it wrong. People, unlike 
machines, are complex and unpredictable. For example, if sales people predict a high increase in sales, 
targets are likely to be set high, making it hard for them to achieve targets. On the other hand if they 
set them to show any kind of downturn, the sales people themselves will probably get the blame. So 
predictions tend to be cautious when personal targets and responsibility could be at stake. Equally if we 
have a new business idea and want to borrow money from the bank, it is likely that we will over-estimate 
potential sales, and the time at which our cash flow will turn positive.

Forecasting trends
Even when we are simply trying to predict sales forecasts, there will be many different people and 
departments of a business involved in this prediction. Information from inside and outside the company is 
relevant, and the quality of both may vary. Since many people are involved and different variables studied, 
any errors or inconsistencies or communication failures will make this a very imprecise activity indeed. 
To quote a larger example cited by Makridakis et al (p. 491), look at the Eurotunnel project involving 
major engineering work between UK and France to build a rail link under the sea. In 1986, passenger 
estimates were 16.5million for the first year of operation. In 1993 this forecast was reduced to 13 million. 
In 1994 it was reduced to 6 million. The first full year (1995) produced 3 million passengers. The actual 
cost of building was also more than twice the initial estimate and the intended data of opening was 
missed by almost two years. Such big projects as this, and for example bids to host the Olympic games 
(as in UK 2012) are frequently subject to major revisions as more actual data becomes available.
Just because the idea or technology is possible, it isn’t necessarily feasible or implementable; and just 
because it is feasible, doesn’t mean people will want to do it. Can you think of examples of possible 
technologies, which either are or are not feasible technologies, which are not wanted? 
Forecasting is nonetheless an important business activity underpinning the accurate determination and 
acquisition of resources (human, capital, buildings, money, energy, materials etc.) and the scheduling 
of their use.

Forecasting trends
Clearly this chapter is more focused on research in business, than on academic research about and for 
business. But as we discuss the issues in forecasting, the debates we have been having will begin to recur; 
for example the extent to which the researcher’s assumptions affect the outcomes of that research, the 
opportunities and risks associated with quantitative data and its analysis, and an attempt to understand 
how qualitative research can contribute to this field. All these ideas apply to forecasting trends. 
11.3	
Existing methodologies for forecasting
Forecasting methodologies can be divided into:
1.	 quantitative techniques, which generally use historical time series data as the basis for projection, 
and regression analysis to determine the relative importance and relationships of variables, 
2.	 qualitative techniques, using scenarios which are known to explore the unknown, and 
3.	 creative techniques, which aim to suggest possible alternatives where there is no factual basis 
of information. 
11.3.1	
Quantitative techniques 
These assume some historical, numerical data is available and that the patterns found in the data may 
continue (assumption of continuity). 
Managers frequently use numerical data in an intuitive way, using their judgement and experience (or the 
toss of a coin!) to predict how trends will move. This is so widespread as to be a norm in much business 
practice – why is this, when formal quantitative techniques using statistics both exist and can tell us more 
about the possible trends? It seems that we are seduced by numbers and react emotionally to them – 
usually seeing them as important because they are numbers, not from any intrinsic importance. (This 
explains why spurious research studies can get great media coverage by producing shocking statistics – 
you may wish to look at the book Bad Science by Dr. Ben Goldacre for some interesting examples). 
Time series forecasting 
This is about finding patterns in historical data and extrapolating them into the future. This approach 
does not attempt to understand why the data behave as they do, because the data is seen as too complex 
to understand or difficult to break down and use, or because we don’t need to know what affects the data 
pattern, only the outcome of the data values. Such techniques are used to plan and schedule outcomes 
in business. The assumption of time series forecasting is that past behaviour/performance of a system 
will predict future behaviour/performance of the same system. In times of significant change, this 
assumption is rarely true.

Forecasting trends
Explanatory models 
Here we do look at why the data behave as they do, and attempt to identify the key variables affecting 
the data values. It is unlikely that the variables we investigate will account for all the change in the data 
value, so an element of error is introduced to represent what we cannot explain. Such models are used 
for policy formulation. Identifying the key variables is a challenge in explanatory forecasting models.
11.3.2	
Qualitative techniques 
These may be used alone or in conjunction with quantitative techniques and involve the contribution of 
experts. Such experts may be professional forecasters and planners, or consultants with a deep knowledge 
of an industrial sector, or facilitators who know how to harness the knowledge of in-company talent 
to produce forecasts for the medium and long term. Qualitative approaches may be used for strategy 
formulation and product development. A Dephi study is one such qualitative technique utilizing the 
judgement of a panel of experts and synthesized into a final report and prediction by the panel facilitator. 
11.3.3	
Creative techniques 
These are used broadly when neither of the other sets of techniques can help because there is a lack of 
historical data. For example, how do we extrapolate trends for new technologies, which have only just 
arrived? How do we predict macro level changes such as climate change, when vast computing power 
is needed for the number of potential variables, and much of what is known is estimation not proven 
knowledge? 
The answer is to use the power of the human brain to make connections between the forecasting problem 
and other knowledge. The use of analogy, for example, i.e. finding a storyline, which may be made to 
fit the problem in order to explore possible outcomes or add to possible predictions, dates back at last 
to Aristotle. Analogies may be taken from a different discipline (e.g. biology related to engineering) 
or fiction (well known plotlines which can be applied to a situation to develop possible outcomes), or 
simply factual stories of other products, or business decisions. Makridakis in Chapter 9 describes three 
helpful characteristics, which seem to apply to long term predictions: 
•	 Accurate over the long term but impossible to identify when (e.g. Roger Bacon predicting 
submarines in 1260) 
•	 Disbelief from most people, even those directly affected, about the potential of new inventions 
(famous example of the chairman of IBM predicting a maximum demand for computers of 100 
in the early 1950s, similar reluctance to predict the spread and use of mobile phones) 
•	 Over-prediction of the benefits and scale of new technology once it has started to spread (this 
is the “paperless office” type prediction).

Forecasting trends
Scenario-building is another creative technique in future forecasting, in fact for many global businesses, 
there are departments specialising in this area of research. 
Scenarios are built on some historical information, plus subjective interpretations, hunches and specific 
assumptions. Their purpose is not necessarily to provide accurate predictions, but to challenge linear 
models of prediction, since actual change is not usually linear, but most predictive methods produce linear 
outcomes. Big business must invest in this type of activity to protect its territory and find opportunities 
before the competition. 
11.3.4	
Forecasting stages 
1.	 Define the problem and the need 
2.	 Collect information – quantitative and qualitative data 
3.	 Exploratory analysis – look for patterns in the data, possible trends, seasonality, cyclical patterns, 
relationships in the variables 
4.	 Select forecasting techniques e.g. exponential smoothing, regression and more advance 
statistical models or opting for qualitative or creative techniques 
5.	 Use the model and evaluate the forecasts produced.

Basic forecasting tools
Here are the popular ones: 
•	 Time series – much of the secondary data discussed in our earlier chapter is produced in this 
format, so could be used for prediction. Clearly cross-sectional data is all from one time period 
so cannot be used for time series. 
•	 Graphical summaries – line graphs of a variable against time (horizontal axis), shows trends 
in historical data, special events, cyclical or seasonal patterns (latter from monthly data). 
A seasonal plot will use a line graph over the period of a year, with different annual data 
plotted together to show similarities and differences. A scatter diagram will be useful to show 
cross-sectional data in how one variable relates to another, this may be of use for explanatory 
modelling. Where a linear trend can be seen in a graph, a “straight line” forecast can be made 
(though will not necessarily be accurate!). 
•	 Numerical summaries – univariate statistics e.g. mean, median, mode, standard deviation 
and bivariate statistics e.g. co-variance and correlation have been discussed in our chapter on 
quantitative techniques. All help to get to know the data in preparation for forecasting. All 
statistics can be shown over time. Time series data can compute autocorrelation, which can 
be shown clearly in a graphical way e.g. correlogram. 
•	 Averaging –a simple forecast method uses an average of monthly data over a time period of 
some years to be the predicted forecast figure for that month in the next year. 
•	 Prediction intervals – used to give an estimate of the range within with the actual value will fall, 
if the forecast value and Mean Squared Error has been computed. The formula uses a standard 
z-value, which is associated with a particular probability level – i.e. in the example z=1.645 is 
associated with a 90% probability level. 
Fn+1 ± z..MSE
•	 Least squares estimates – a way of estimating values for which the mean squared error (MSE) 
is at a minimum. It is an estimation of goodness of fit of a relationship between variables. 
•	 Accuracy of linear regression, when using an explanatory model and a particular variable has 
impact on the forecast. In other words this is about working out the relationship between one 
dependent variable (to be forecast) and an independent variable which could explain how the 
dependent variable changes. If there is more than one independent variable, multiple regression 
is used. Forecasting is done by understanding the relationship between the dependent and 
independent variables, such that we can use new values for the independent variable(s) and 
predict corresponding values for the dependent variable. The dependent variable is often 
referred to as the “outcome variable” (the thing being predicted) and independent variables are 
often referred to as “predictor variables” as they are the variables used to make the predictions. 
The accuracy of multiple regressions improves as the number of non co-linear variables are 
introduced into the regression equation.

Forecasting trends
•	 Transformations and adjustments – include mathematical transformation of the data values (e.g. 
square root or logarithm) of each value to smooth the variation and make forecasting simpler, 
calendar adjustments to take account of different lengths of months in some data given per 
day, adjustments can also be made for numbers of trading days in a month or for inflation or 
population change. A simple moving average (e.g. averaging the value before during and after 
the period and using this as the new data value) will provide a simple and understandable 
smoothing technique to allow patterns in the data to be more visible. 
11.5	
Measures commonly used to evaluate forecasts
11.5.1	
Statistical measures 
Comparing forecast and actual figures per time period will give a data series which can be averaged to 
give mean error of the forecast. However, positive and negative errors will tend to cancel each other, so 
mean error is likely to be quite small. It should, however, tell us of systematic forecasting error. 
Mean Absolute Error is computed the same way but taking all differences between actual and forecast 
as positive. Mean Squared Error squares each difference and produces a similar clearer picture of the 
error in forecasting, than the Mean Error. 
A more useable error can be calculated through Percentage Error (PE), where each value of the difference 
between actual and forecast is divided by the actual value, giving a percentage error value. From these 
PEs, a Mean Percentage Error can be calculated, which is a useful meaningful estimate of error provided 
there is a meaningful origin to the scale used and the time series does not contain zeros. 
11.5.2	
Out-of-sample accuracy measurement 
This method simply divides the data set in two and uses part of it to estimate parameters and set up 
the forecast model. This is then tested on the second part of the data for accuracy (referred to as the 
in-sample or training set. The test data can then be used to determine how well the model will actually 
forecast a new set of data.
11.5.3	
Comparing forecast methods 
The naïve method of making forecasts uses the more recent data as the prediction, (or doing the same 
but with seasonally adjusted data) and computes the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage 
Error of these naïve predictions when compared with actual data. The naïve method is used to compare 
the results of more sophisticated forecasting techniques to actual results.

Forecasting trends
11.5.3	
Theil’s U-statistic 
The Makridakis text (1998) suggested offers a good description of U-statistic. This is essentially a 
coefficient. Note that the value of the U-statistic suggests the accuracy of a forecast as follows: 
U=1 then the naïve forecast is as good as the forecasting technique being evaluated 
U<1 then the forecasting technique is better than the naïve method 
U>1 then the naïve method is better than the forecasting technique. 
11.5.4	
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of forecast error 
ACF is used to identify any pattern in errors after a forecasting model has been used. You can calculate 
the autocorrelation function to see if there is a pattern of error which could be avoided. Again the 
Makridakis text (1998) provides a good explanation of detail. 
11.6	
Exploring the value of forecasting methods in business practice
Statistical methods of forecasting are not nearly as widely used in business as we might expect. 
Moving average and exponential smoothing, plus simple linear and multiple regression analysis, are the 
most widely known methods of quantitative technique for forecasting.

Forecasting trends
While time series methods are generally found to be more accurate in prediction than explanatory 
models e.g. using regression, it is the latter which is seen by managers to be the most effective technique. 
Makridakis, et al conclude that: 
•	 Simple methods for forecasting are at least as good as complex statistical methods 
•	 Some methods are better for short time horizons than others. 
•	 Different methods vary in accuracy depending on the method of evaluating accuracy 
•	 Averaging of forecasts using more than one method results in more accurate predictions. 
•	 Short term predictions can take advantage of inertia in business phenomena and use this with 
seasonality and cyclical patterns to make useful forecasts 
•	 Medium term predications are likely to be affected greatly by economic and environmental 
changes, so may vary in effectiveness depending on assumptions about the direction and speed 
of these changes. 
•	 Long term predictions will decrease the effectiveness of statistical modelling at the business 
level and the use of creative technique may be the way forward here. 
•	 Key advice for improvements in forecasting includes the keeping of accurate records – without 
these we have only intuition.

5.	 recognize different methods of presenting and disseminating research.
12.2	
Your personal approach to writing a research report
Which parts of a research study appeal to you most? 
1.	 Exploring and defining a research problem.
2.	 Reading and reviewing the literature.
3.	 Designing the research methods. 
4.	 Conducting the research.
5.	 Analysing data. 
6.	 Writing the research report.
Did anyone answer “6”? Probably not!
For most of us it is other parts of the research process, which appeal most, yet without stage 6, no-one 
else will ever reap the benefit of our work. It is a fundamental principle of research that we must publicise 
and disseminate what we find in some way, and that way usually involves writing reports.

Reporting research results
One of the big issues with writing reports is that we leave it until near the end, believing it to be a 
simple part of the work, which can be sorted at the last minute, before a deadline. Of course, we are too 
intelligent really to believe this, but this is how we behave. One good answer to this problem is to plan. 
Not a rough idea of stages, which gets lost during the research and quickly becomes meaningless, but a 
proper Gantt chart of activities, showing: 
1.	 how long we expect each activity to take, 
2.	 which, if any, are dependent on the completion of other activities, 
3.	 what resources are needed for each activity, 
4.	 any help needed from others and 
5.	 by when each activity will be completed. 
My best students, who complete detailed Gantt charts, are the ones who give me a new updated 
copy showing actions achieved at every supervisor meeting, who include those supervisor meetings as 
milestones in the chart, and who plan to start writing way ahead of deadlines. As the supervisor, this 
works well, as it allows me to decide how comfortable I am with their level of writing, and enables me 
to make vital improvement suggestions at an early stage if they are necessary.

Reporting research results
In the book “How to get a PhD” by Phillips and Pugh (2010) they state that “writing is the only time 
when we really think.” Do you agree with this statement? I am not sure I do, but I do know that writing 
and thinking are inextricably bound together, so if no other thoughts are happening, start writing. 
12.2.1	
How you write 
Do you have particular rituals and routines to get yourself started on writing? Most of us do. There is no 
one right way, we are all different. Some people just write, others need to collect everything they need 
together first. Others start with a coffee or sit in a particular place to write. What about you? 
12.2.2	
When you write 
Do you need to set chunks of time aside? It is rare to be able to write in a sustained way in short pieces 
of time such as half an hour. Most of us need at least an hour or two to think ourselves into the piece of 
writing and make some progress. It can then take another half hour of immersion each time you start 
after a break. It is also important to make sure you are physically and mentally fresh to write. Whether 
you write best at night or in the day, there will need to be some energy and sustained focus, which 
usually only comes when you are in good form. The alternative is to wait until pure adrenalin forces you 
to write at the last minute, when there is no option. Not a great idea, especially for a piece of work like 
a research report, where, if you are fresh, new and often valuable ideas will come to you as you write. 
12.2.3	
Tools to help you write 
Simply understanding everything you can do with your word-processing software is a good start. That 
particularly includes using heading styles in Microsoft Word™, since this saves time if you have to produce 
a table of contents for your work. If you haven’t used this feature, check it now before you have to write 
your report. 
Other tools include those which can help you get your ideas together, such as mindmapping software 
(e.g. Mindgenius™, or www.bubblus.com). If you haven’t come across these pieces of software, don’t 
worry, they are not essential. They are a great aid if you regularly have to produce written work of some 
length and like the creative approach of mind-mapping. However it is also very easy to produce a mind 
map on paper! 
Finally specific citation software programs can be a great help if you intend to research on a regular basis 
and need to build a good retrievable archive of references. Packages include Endnote™ and Procite™ – 
all the packages mentioned can be found on the web. A citation software package is simply a tailored 
database, which prompts you to record all the relevant details of a reference as you enter it, has space for 
notes on your reading of it, and can automatically work alongside Word to insert text references and an 
automatically generated bibliography. All you have to do is choose the format. Student versions of these 
packages are available. If you do not want to go this far, think about how you will keep your references 
in a retrievable format to save time when writing up. Chapter 2 presented additional details on how to 
keep track of references and citations using a variety of style manuals.

The differences between writing a report for a business audience and for 
academic purposes
12.3.1	
Business reports 
Here there is a need for clarity, brevity and simplicity. Be sure to include an executive summary which 
focuses on the problem and suggested action. Sometimes there will be a corporate house style to adopt. 
12.3.2	
Academic reports 
There is still a need for a clear, succinct style but using appropriate terminology, for example on research 
methodology, which will not be everyday language. Avoid using description wherever possible and instead 
take a critical analytical approach (discussed in the chapter on literature reviews). Pay special attention 
to academic referencing and avoid plagiarism. Read and use peer-reviewed academic journal articles to 
set the tone of academic writing. 
Find a good academic journal article and consider trying to rate the suitability of the writing, the sections 
used and the persuasiveness of the article. Remember that in articles there are very strict and short word 
limits, which means we rarely see a detailed research method description, except where this is the point 
of the article, and we also rarely see a full literature review, which would be expected in work written 
for formal academic assignments or research reports for funding bodies, masters’ theses and doctoral 
dissertations.
12.3.3	
Elements of an academic research report: 
The organization of your research report is of utmost importance. But do not overlook a well-designed 
cover page (and table of content for lengthier works). And while it may seem simple, having a succinct 
descriptive and interesting title is worth spend some time preparing. You want to capture your audience’s 
attention from the start, and this is where it begins, 
The typical organizational format for a research paper includes the following parts:
Abstract, – written last as this must include a flavour of results, don’t repeat phrases from the main text. 
If we don’t get the reader’s interest in the short abstract, they are unlikely to read the rest of the report. 
Introduction, – must immediately grab the reader’s attention, often by a dramatic statement of the 
problem or situation to be researched. 
Background, – usually starts with a broad picture and gradually refines it to the narrow focus of the 
research (a filter).
Literature review, – see the earlier chapter on this subject

Research objective and method justification, – most of this book has been about this section, but it 
must not appear as a stand-alone section. Every section including this one should follow logically from 
the previous one and lead naturally to the next. So, for example, the literature review section should 
end with a direction for the primary research, which is then picked up in the research method section. 
Findings, try to offer the findings of your research in as pure a form as possible. This doesn’t mean 
giving raw data, it means finding a way to present that data so the characteristics of the data are clear 
to the reader, without interpreting the data, so that the reader is dependent on your view and cannot 
see the data for themselves. Visual methods such as charts and tables can summarise and present data 
effectively, but not pages and pages of them which soon cause overload. 
Discussion and analysis, this is the real test of your ability to synthesise what you found in the literature 
review and in your primary research and to pull out from that synthesis what seem to you to be the 
most important points. It is not a place to put any description. Writing should be clear but intense – all 
sentences must add value. 
Conclusions, not just a summary of what you found and have already said in the analysis, the conclusions 
section should step back a little and take an objective view of the outcomes – theoretical and practical – 
from the whole project – there should be no new references at this stage, but a clearly persuasive account 
of what has been achieved

Recommendations. – may be detailed and practical or may simply urge further research in an area which 
has been uncovered by your research. Where practical suggestions are made, they must be feasible, 
not “blue sky” ideas. Preferably there should be suggestions about how they could be taken forward – 
sometimes with a tabular implementation plan. 
Appendices. – in an academic piece of work, the appendices are not there to gain extra marks. They are 
there for two possible reasons: a) to add information to the main text where word length or focus did 
not allow their inclusion or b) to maintain a complete record of relevant information, particularly for 
your future use of this document. Keep appendices to a minimum. 
12.3.4	
Style and grammar 
This is important whether you are writing in your first or a second language. In both cases it will be 
wise to ask someone you trust to sub-edit your text. None of us is our own best editor, as many errors 
can easily slip through. If you are submitting an initial draft section to a supervisor, then errors are not 
so critical, but they must not be at a level, which obscures the meaning! 
If you are concerned about points of pronunciation and grammatical style, the best place to check is 
an English language national newspaper style sheet. These are available online at the paper’s website eg 
The Times, or The Telegraph in UK. These are often better than out of date grammar textbooks, as they 
incorporate current changes of accepted style, but do not lead change, reflecting acceptable style in the 
world of the reader. 
12.3.5	
Bullet points 
This is a key issue for academic work in the 21st century, as students increasingly find bullet points 
acceptable, and modern business favours the use of bullet points to encapsulate an argument quickly 
and clearly (in Microsoft Powerpoint™ style). There is nothing wrong with using bullet points in business 
reports, they can often cut wordy paragraphs and get straight to the point. However, in academic work 
it is usual to avoid them if possible, using them only when giving a list of examples which require no 
further explanation, or summarising the points which are then explained in more detail below. Why? 
Because an academic reader, specifically a marker of academic work, cannot tell from a bullet point 
whether you have understood something or merely copied out a list. 
12.3.6	
Use of first person 
Whether you use the word “I thought or I did…” in your academic writing will vary according to the 
purpose of the section of writing. However the general rule is not to use the first person except in two 
specific cases: first in a reflective section, where it is entirely legitimate to speak in the first person about 
your learning and experience, and second, in narrative accounts or certain types of qualitative data 
analysis, where this is a usual convention.

In all other cases, it is best to write objectively from the standpoint of a third person, provided you don’t 
have to tie yourself up in knots stylistically to achieve this! 
12.3.7	
A few more words of wisdom 
A common issue in academic writing is the use of verb tenses, as much of your writing may be taking 
place as things happen, results come in etc., thus encouraging you to use the present tense. However, as a 
general rule, it is better to use a consistent past tense as you are writing up a report of something, which 
has happened. Again, certain types of qualitative writing will demand a current tense, and of course 
quotations and transcripts should reflect exactly what was said, however it is usual to spend some time 
converting text to a past tense so that it reads consistently. 
Lengthy sentences and paragraphs can get in the way of meaning. Try to ensure that sentences introduce 
only one idea, and paragraphs group around one idea, rather than letting them include many, which 
makes it harder for the reader to understand. 
Subheadings can also help to break up long areas of text on a page and should be used where sensible. 
Most importantly, your academic writing is for a particular purpose: to persuade the reader of your 
ideas, which requires an engaging, clear and rhetorical style. 
12.3.8	
Logical structure of research reports 
A final point: the logic of your written report. For any audience, logical argument and flow from one 
section to another is vital. In an academic research report, it can be helpful to draft an audit of how 
specific findings in your research relate to particular literature and particular ideas, which then feature 
in your conclusions. In this way, all conclusions should be traceable back to the findings they came from 
and a logical flow established. 
If you are not regularly used to writing such research reports or dissertations, then consider logic this 
way: in a really good piece of fiction writing, the reader is led along by always wanting to know what 
happens next. How can you apply this to your research report? The introduction should cause the 
reader to understand why you looked at the literature, what problem you wanted to solve or question 
you wanted to answer. When we read the literature review, we find out what that told you, but are left 
understanding that the literature didn’t fully answer all your questions, or perhaps raised new ones. We 
find this out in the conclusion of the literature review and are left wanting to know how you are going 
to answer those remaining questions. So we read on to the research method, in which you tell us why 
you chose this particular way of finding answers to your research questions, and then, in the findings, 
what you actually found as the answers.

But that isn’t enough. We are often left at the end of the findings section thinking –“how did that relate 
to what we heard about in the literature?” So we want to read on to the discussion to find out. By the 
end of the discussion, we know what you found and how it stacked up with the literature, but we are 
tempted to say “so what?” You answer this in the conclusion and recommendations by explaining what 
that means for the big questions you raised in your introduction, and what else remains to be done if 
there are unanswered questions which your research triggered. 
All this means that each section concludes with a “cliff-hanger” – an unresolved question or problem 
which makes the reader want to read more in the next section. Putting in conclusions like this to each 
section, helps the reader to see the logic of your work. 
12.3.9	
Logic as a “U” shape. 
You may also think about a “U” shape pattern to this structure, where the introduction and context begins 
at high level with “big picture” issues – maybe about the economy or the state of an industry sector. As 
you proceed through your research report, you drill down into more detail, so that by the time we read 
the findings, we are reading very detailed information in a particular context of your research, which 
you have found at the bottom of the hole you have dug to find out more about your question.

Then you start to take us back to the surface as you relate this detailed set of findings to the published 
literature, climbing back up eventually to conclusions at “big picture” level. Now we can see the whole 
problem again, but now we have your original primary research to add to our knowledge about that 
problem, and guide us where to go next in further research. 
12.4	
Producing an oral presentation of key findings
In business, it will be usual practice to present an oral presentation of a report, possibly using the 
report itself as a “leave-behind” for readers to follow-up their undoubted interest in your subject! If 
using Microsoft Powerpoint™ software to present the gist of your ideas, then it is simple to produce 
clear and professional-looking slides for projection which set out the background, your objectives, your 
understanding of the context, your method(s) and your results, together with next steps/ recommendations 
for action. Remember that when presenting orally, we must speak directly to the audience and encourage 
their involvement. At the least this will involve a pause at some point for questions, but for preference 
time will be designed in to get some audience participation at an earlier stage. Unless you are very 
familiar with the audience, it is good practice to ask something early on, which tells you a little about 
their experience of the topic, so that you can involve them in your talk. 
Any presentation will be enhanced by visual aids rather than endless bullet-style slides. Writing the 
bullets can be helpful for us to remember what we want to get across, but the actual presentation may 
keep the bullets only for us, and for summary use, and focus on simple and dramatic visuals (photos 
for preference) which relate to your research, the problem or the outcome. Presenting to an in-company 
audience means not only a house-style (often branded slides) but also using your researcher’s objectivity 
to add depth to a focused corporate message. This is quite different from an academic presentation, which 
will use your objectivity to show your academic credibility and focus on the extent of your knowledge 
of published sources as well as the research you have achieved yourself. 
Whether in the academic written report, the business report or a presentation, well-selected quotations 
from your research data, which reveal and give a flavour for your findings, are of high value. Not too 
many, just a few to show your connection with the “real world” which your research was conducted and 
how it relates to your findings and recommendations. 
Whatever you do, you should not use your PowerPoint slides as a script to be read to your audience. 
Having just concluded your research project, you should now be the master of its content. Use your 
presentation to capture your audience’s attention and focus in on key points you want to get across to them.

We have mentioned social media sparsely in this book, but here is where it can come into its own. 
Professional use of social networks can be a great way to make an impact with your research and create 
a following. Social media platforms regularly change and mutate, but at the time of writing, it would be 
wise not to over-use Facebook to try to make serious professional connections – that is not its purpose. 
However LinkedIn currently offers a much more professional network for summarizing your research 
and promoting your key ideas. Blogging and micro-blogging (Twitter) can also produce great connections 
for research. You may want to use a filtering technique, such as Lists in Twitter to make sure you can 
regularly check professional contacts and posts concerning research without having to wade through 
lots of personal chat. 
Whatever platforms you choose, make your research report work for you. You began with a big idea 
and have had to work hard to make it into good research based on valid evidence. Now apply it, use it 
and promote it to those interested – perhaps your participants/respondents, perhaps an organization 
who might value your results. See whether your academic supervisor is prepared to co-author a research 
conference paper on your work, using their connections to support your scholarship. Or if you produced 
this research for your organization, see who in senior management might value your results. Your business 
research is only valuable if people get to hear about it.
