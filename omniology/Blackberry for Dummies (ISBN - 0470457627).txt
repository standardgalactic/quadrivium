BlackBerry For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
xviii

Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to the third edition of BlackBerry For Dummies. 
The BlackBerry is the best-selling smartphone in North America, and 
we assume that you own one. This is a great book to have around when you 
want to discover new features or need something to slap open and use as a 
quick reference. If you are new to the BlackBerry and have some basic ques-
tions (such as “What is a BlackBerry?” or “How can a BlackBerry help me 
be more productive?”), you can benefit by reading this book from cover to 
cover. If you bought the previous editions of our book and recently got a new 
BlackBerry, this third edition bridges the gap and gets you up to date on the 
latest innovations that have been added to your device. No matter what your 
current BlackBerry user status — BUS, for short — we’re here to help you get 
the most out of your BlackBerry.
Right off the bat, we can tell you that a BlackBerry is not a fruit you find at 
the supermarket but rather is an always-connected handheld device that 
has e-mail capabilities and a built-in Internet browser. With your BlackBerry, 
you are in the privileged position of always being able to receive e-mail and 
browse the Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry has all the features you expect from a personal 
organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and did we men-
tion that a BlackBerry also has a built-in mobile phone? Talk about multitask-
ing! Imagine being stuck on a commuter train: With your BlackBerry by your 
side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a conference call — all from 
the comfort of your seat.
That’s not all. BlackBerry goes a step further to make it more fun for you to 
own this device. You can snap a picture with its camera, listen to your music 
collection, and enjoy capturing and watching video.
In this book, we show you all the basics but then go the extra mile by high-
lighting some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features of the BlackBerry. 
Your BlackBerry can work hard for you when you need it, as well as play 
hard when you want it to. (Need we say that we’re ready, willing, and able to 
show you where to get great games for your BlackBerry?)

About This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a comprehensive user guide as well as 
a quick user reference. This book is designed so that you certainly can read it 
from cover to cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter after 
the other. Feel free to jump around while you explore the different 
functionalities of your BlackBerry.
We cover basic and advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider 
the most practical and frequently used. If you use or want to use a certain 
function of your BlackBerry, we likely cover it here.
This book is also targeted to the latest models as of this writing. Without 
going into the many model numbers, if you see a camera lens in your device, 
this book is intended for you. If you own a BlackBerry that doesn’t have a 
camera, you should get the second edition of this book. If your BlackBerry 
is a touch-screen model, you should pick up BlackBerry Storm For Dummies 
(published by Wiley and also written by us).
Who Are You?
In this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but because we’ve 
never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you find that some of these 
images are true about you, this might just be the book for you:
 
✓ You have a BlackBerry, and you want to find out how to get the most 
from it.
 
✓ You don’t have a BlackBerry yet, and you’re wondering what one could 
do for you.
 
✓ You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the 
jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA stands for per-
sonal digital assistant, by the way. Take that, you jargon, you!)
 
✓ You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful and 
cool things with a BlackBerry without bogging you down with unneces-
sary background or theory.
 
✓ You’re tired of hauling your 10-pound laptop with you on trips, and 
you’re wondering how to turn your BlackBerry into a miniature traveling 
office.
 
✓ You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical 
activities in your life, such as sending and receiving e-mail, checking 
your calendar for appointments, and surfing the Web.
 
✓ You like to have some fun with, play games on, and be entertained by a 
device but don’t want to carry an extra game gadget in your bag.

 Introduction
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies, 3rd Edition, consists of five parts, and each part con-
sists of different chapters related to that part’s theme.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry
Part I starts with the basics of your BlackBerry: what it is, what you can do 
with it, and what the parts are. We describe the differences between owning 
a BlackBerry with a SureType versus a QWERTY keyboard. We also show you 
how to personalize and express yourself through your BlackBerry. This part 
wraps up with must-knows about security and where to go for help when you 
get into trouble with your BlackBerry.
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive 
with Your BlackBerry
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA. We 
show you how your BlackBerry keeps your contacts in Contacts as well as 
how to manage your appointments and meetings in Calendar. We also show 
you how to create a to-do list and have Calendar manage your to-do’s for you 
so that you don’t miss a task. As you’ll see, most BlackBerry applications 
interconnect, working hard for you. And finally, you’ll never forget your pass-
words anymore by keeping your BlackBerry organized and secure through 
the Password Keeper application.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online 
with Your BlackBerry
Part III shows you how you can use the true strengths of the BlackBerry — its 
always-connected e-mail and its Web-surfing functionality — but it doesn’t 
stop there. We also point out how you can use other forms of messages on 
the BlackBerry that you might not have known about, such as PIN-to-PIN mes-
sages and BlackBerry Messenger. We also describe the fun features of your 
BlackBerry, such as using its camera to take pictures and capture videos, lis-
tening to music, and watching videos. Rest assured that your BlackBerry will 
be a good companion when you’re traveling because we also show you how 
to use its GPS. And for those who want to extend their BlackBerry’s useful-
ness beyond the out-of-the-box applications, we recommend and describe the 
best applications to enhance your lifestyle.

BlackBerry For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you some of the 
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry, including making back-
ups and installing BlackBerry applications from your PC to your BlackBerry. 
You also find out how to port data from your older devices — BlackBerry 
or not — to your new BlackBerry. We didn’t forget to cover important stuff 
such as data-syncing your appointments and contacts with desktop applica-
tions such as Outlook and Lotus Notes. And for those who have multiple 
BlackBerry devices at home and are willing to take the extra effort, we 
describe how to use BlackBerry Unite, software that you can download free 
from Research In Motion’s Web site that allows you to manage near-real-time 
synchronization of data through a PC connected to the Internet.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens, and this book is no different. 
In Part V, we show you where to get cool BlackBerry accessories, download 
useful applications, visit useful mobile Web sites, and (of course) get great 
games to play on your BlackBerry. In addition, we keep this list up to date on 
our Web site at www.blackberryfordummies.com.
So Many Models, So Little Time
When you first visit the Web site for Research In Motion (RIM, the brains 
behind the BlackBerry device), you might be overwhelmed by the many 
variations of BlackBerry. These devices comes in many colors, some with 
QWERTY keyboards, some with a QWERTY-like keyboard (which RIM calls 
SureType), some with a camera, and some with two screens. Whew!
Don’t worry, it isn’t as complicated as it seems; let us break it down for 
you. (Remember that we’re not talking about the touch-screen BlackBerry 
here.) We generally don’t like to generalize, but you can pretty much divide 
the BlackBerry with keyboard into two categories: the SureType and the 
QWERTY. And why did we make such a separation? You operate the two 
models a bit differently. But that doesn’t mean that the functions underneath 
are different. Beneath the surface, they are quite similar. For example, both 
models can do e-mail, but how you get to your e-mail application is a bit dif-
ferent in each. It’s that simple. Of course, there are other small (yet impor-
tant) differences, which we denote in this book with a Pearl icon (see the 
following section). The Pearl icon covers the traditional Pearl model and the 

5
 Introduction
Pearl Flip, which is the only BlackBerry flip phone as of this writing. Pearl Flip 
is actually a Pearl that features a different hardware look and an extra screen, 
but the user experience should be very similar to that of a Pearl.
This book is written with the latest models of the SureType and QWERTY 
types in mind. If you have a slightly older model, not to worry; you’ll find this 
book useful because the functionality is still similar. You just might discover, 
however, that some of the newer functions we cover may not be available 
on your particular (older) BlackBerry. Of course, you can always refer to the 
second edition of this book.
Icons in This Book
 
If a paragraph sports this icon, it means we’re talking about BlackBerry 
devices that are provided by your employer.
 
Text marked with this icon applies to the BlackBerry Pearl or the BlackBerry 
Pearl Flip, which use the SureType technology. Other BlackBerry models use a 
full QWERTY keyboard. On the Pearl’s and Pearl Flip’s SureType keyboard, 
many keys share letters.
 
This icon highlights an important point that you don’t want to forget because 
it just might come up again. We’d never be so cruel as to spring a pop quiz on 
you, but paying attention to these details can definitely help you.
 
This book rarely delves into the geeky, technical details, but when it does, this 
icon warns you. Read on if you want to get under the hood a little, or just skip 
ahead if you aren’t interested in the gory details.
 
Here’s where you can find not-so-obvious tricks that can make you a 
BlackBerry power user in no time. Pay special attention to the paragraphs 
with this icon to get the most out of your BlackBerry.
 
Look out! This icon tells you how to avoid trouble before it starts.

Your BlackBerry

In this part . . .
T
he road to a happy and collaborative relationship 
with your BlackBerry starts here. Chapter 1 covers all 
the nuts and bolts: how the BlackBerry works, its look and 
feel, and its connectivity. Chapter 2 describes the major 
differences among BlackBerry models. Chapter 3 discusses 
customizing your BlackBerry and also offers timesaving 
shortcuts.

Chapter 1
Your BlackBerry Isn’t a Fruit
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out your BlackBerry behind the scenes
▶ Seeing what your BlackBerry can do
▶ Handling the hardware
B
ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a BlackBerry (and 
we’re pretty sure that you’re not eating it). We’re just curious, though — 
what actually convinced you to buy this particular handheld mobile device? 
Was it the always-connected e-mail, the multimedia player to replace your iPod 
or iPhone, or a really good sales pitch? We know; the list could go on and on — 
and we might never hit on the exact reason you got yours. For whatever reason 
you bought your BlackBerry, congratulations; you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy your BlackBerry are clearly at it again. 
This time, your intelligence led you to pick up this book, perhaps because 
your intuition told you there’s more to your BlackBerry than meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your BlackBerry can help you do more than you 
thought. For example, your BlackBerry is a whiz at making phone calls, but 
it’s also a computer that can check your e-mail and surf the Web. We’re talk-
ing World Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is always at your finger-
tips instead of sitting on some desk at home or at the office:
 
✓ Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner?
 
✓ Need to know — right now — what’s showing in your local movie the-
aters, or what the weather will be like tonight, or what’s the best place 
to shop the sales?
 
✓ Need to know your current location and get directions to that cozy 
bed-and-breakfast, or retrieve news headlines, or check stock quotes?
 
✓ Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online?
 
✓ Hankering to network with your old classmates?
You can do all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry.

10
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of the box, 
it provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do lists, 
manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, a PDA, 
a GPS, and a full-on media player all built into one makes you a powerful 
person. With your BlackBerry (along with this resourceful book), you really 
can increase your productivity and become better organized. Watch out, 
world! BlackBerry-wielding powerhouse coming through!
If you stick with us, you find out all you need to get the most out of your 
device or maybe even save a troubled relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit 
of an exaggeration, but we got your attention, right?)
How It All Works: The 
Schematic Approach
For those who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to go far; 
the following sections are just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry actually works, you might also 
be wondering why you didn’t get your BlackBerry from RIM (Research 
In Motion) rather than from a network service provider such as AT&T or 
T-Mobile. Why did you need to go through a middle person? After all, RIM 
makes the BlackBerry.
That’s an excellent question — and here’s the quick-and-dirty answer: RIM 
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its 
technology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system 
all by its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) 
with what developed into its network service providers — the usual suspects 
(meaning the big cellphone companies). These middlemen support the wireless 
network for your BlackBerry so that you can connect to the BlackBerry Internet 
service — and get all those wonderful e-mails (and spend so much valuable 
time surfing the Internet). See Figure 1-1 for an overview of this process.

Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return, 
RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the BlackBerry they offer 
for sale. For example, a T-Mobile BlackBerry looks different from a similar 
model you get from Vodafone.
 
Which leads to another question: Do BlackBerry functionalities differ from 
phone model to phone model? Quick answer: On the core BlackBerry applica-
tions (such as Tasks and Address Book), you find no major differences. Other 
features, such as Instant Messaging, might or might not be supported by the 
network service provider.
Just to keep the score card straight, when we talk about features available 
from one network service provider that aren’t available from others, we point 
them out.
Connecting to your computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. People spend so 
much time using them, and so much information is stored in them. No sur-
prise that BlackBerry works hand in hand with your PC. The USB cable that 
comes with your BlackBerry does more than just charge your device.

12
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Part IV helps you use your PC connection with the help of BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager and all the utilities that come with it. For instance, in Chapter 15, 
you find how to sync your device with the Personal Information Manager 
data that you keep in your PC. You can also read Chapter 16 for directions 
about switching from another device (even a non-BlackBerry device) to a new 
BlackBerry. For example, you find out how to import your contact list into your 
new BlackBerry. Chapter 18 tells you how to protect your data. Last, Chapter 
19 talks about installing new applications to your BlackBerry with the help of 
your PC.
Note that if you have a Mac instead of a PC, you can still sync with the 
PocketMac Sync on your Mac. Research In Motion does not actually support 
the application but does provide the software for free.
BlackBerrying the world 
with your BlackBerry
If you received your BlackBerry from T-Mobile or AT&T, chances are that 
your BlackBerry will continue to work when you travel to, say, London 
or Beijing. All you need to worry about is remembering to turn on your 
BlackBerry (and maybe the extra roaming charges).
Because your BlackBerry is quad band, it works in more than 90 countries. 
What is quad band? Basically, different cellphone networks in different 
countries operate on different frequencies. For example, the United States 
operates on 850 and 1900 MHz, Canada operates on 850 and 1900 MHz, and 
Europe and Asia Pacific operate on 900 and 1800 MHz.
 
Your quad-band BlackBerry is designed to work on 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 
MHz, and 1900 MHz, so you’re covered almost wherever you go. Check with 
your network service provider to see whether your BlackBerry will work 
at your destination before you hop on a plane, just to be sure.
 
Nothing stands still in this world, and this saying is proven by the fact that 
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) has spawned High Speed 
Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), technologies that have been growing 
because they work on the same GSM phone infrastructure. This HSDPA is now 
available in the United States through most major network service providers. 
HSDPA competes in the marketplace against CDMA’s (Code Division Multiple 
Access) EvDo.
What’s it to you? CDMA and GSM aren’t compatible. Your phone works on 
only one technology. When you travel outside North America, you face the 
burning question: CDMA or GSM? (Read: Will my BlackBerry work on this 
country’s network or won’t it?)

13
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Isn’t a Fruit
If you currently work with GSM, you should be okay to travel outside the 
United States. Most non–North American countries are on GSM networks. If 
you’re a CDMA kind of person, you might have some “issues,” as they say. 
When in doubt, talk to your network service provider.
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
In the BlackBerry world, always-connected e-mail used to be the primary 
factor that made BlackBerry very attractive and was likely first in the long 
list of reasons you got yours. And, if you need to go global, you can use your 
BlackBerry in more than 100 plus countries. Just hop off your flight, turn on 
your BlackBerry, and voilà: You can receive and send e-mails whether you’re 
in Hong Kong, London, or Paris. Your significant other can get in touch with 
you wherever you are — just to say hi or to remind you that you promised 
Aunt Edna a bottle of Chanel No. 5.
 
One caveat here — you need to make sure that your network service provider 
has the technology to go global. See the preceding section of this chapter for 
more info. Generally speaking, you can receive and send e-mails just like you 
do when you’re at home.
Know your BlackBerry history
Your BlackBerry is truly a wondrous thing, 
boasting many features beyond your ordinary 
mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity 
didn’t happen overnight. Like any other good 
product, BlackBerry has come a long way from 
its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the PalmPilot ruled the PDA 
world, Research In Motion (RIM, the maker 
of the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab, ignor-
ing the then-popular graffiti input method, 
and designing a device with a QWERTY 
keyboard — the kind of keyboard people 
were already used to from working on their 
computers. RIM didn’t stop there, however. It 
added an always-connected e-mail capability, 
making this device a must-have among gov-
ernment officials as well as finance and health 
professionals.
To meet the needs of government officials 
and industry professionals, RIM made reli-
ability, security, and durability the priorities 
when manufacturing its devices. Today, the 
BlackBerry comes from the same line of RIM 
family products, inheriting all the good genes 
while boosting usability and adding more func-
tions to its core BlackBerry applications. As a 
result, BlackBerry is popular among not only 
prosumers (professional customers) but also 
consumers. Starting with BlackBerry Pearl, 
RIM has been targeting the mainstream con-
sumer market. Clearly, with BlackBerry, RIM is 
winning the hearts of consumers while main-
taining its hold on the enterprise market.

14
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Although e-mail is BlackBerry’s strength, that’s not the only thing it can do. 
The following sections go beyond e-mail to point out some of the device’s 
other major benefits.
All-in-one multimedia center
Previously, many people hesitated to buy a BlackBerry due to the lack of mul-
timedia functions. They wanted a camera and audio and full video playback. 
BlackBerry has changed all that and has more features than you may expect. 
Not only does BlackBerry have a high-resolution camera — but it also has a 
memory slot for a microSD chip (see Chapter 2). What does that mean?
Well, it means your BlackBerry can function as the following:
 
✓ A music player
 
✓ A video player
 
✓ A portable flash drive
 
✓ Your personal photo collection
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, with the new BlackBerry Web browser, you can surf the Net nearly as 
smoothly as you do on a desktop computer. Even better, you can continue 
chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, just as if you never left 
your office. You’ll get an alert when your stock is tanking. True, that isn’t fun, 
but you want this information as fast as possible.
Intrigued? Read how BlackBerry can take full advantage of the Web in 
Chapter 9.
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to 
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize my 
day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all means go ahead and hire a per-
sonal assistant. The next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA). Just 
like people come in many flavors, so do many PDAs.

15
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Isn’t a Fruit
Whip out that BlackBerry of yours and take a closer look. That’s right; your 
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA, helping you do all this and much more:
 
✓ Remember all your acquaintances (see Chapter 4)
 
✓ Manage your appointments (Chapter 5)
 
✓ Keep a to-do list (Chapter 6)
A computer in the palm of your hand
Remarkable communication device? Check.
Full-fledged PDA? Check.
Full-featured media player? Check.
These capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the 
device because of its size: Your BlackBerry is also a powerful computer.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, with no fiddling, it comes with 
a great set of organizational and productivity tools in the form of programs. 
Software developers besides RIM are taking advantage of this growing market — 
which means that hundreds of applications are out there for you. For exam-
ple, you can download graphic-intensive games or a mortgage calculator.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry supports the downloading of applications 
through BlackBerry Browser. And of course, downloading of the application 
can be done both wired and wireless (or OTA — over the air). By the time 
you read this book, Research In Motion will have rolled out the Application 
Store Front, which is a single icon that allows you to browse through applica-
tions made by third-party developers. (For more information on downloading 
third-party applications, see Chapter 9.)
 
To be honest, we have no way to foresee how many applications will be on 
the market when you’re reading this book. And the price of an application 
varies, depending on how sophisticated the program is, so we can’t really give 
firm numbers. But if you’re curious, check out Chapters 14 and 21, where we 
describe some of the best business applications. You should be able to find 
some treasures suited to your field of work.

16
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Look Dad, no hands!
Your BlackBerry is equipped with an earphone that doubles as a mic for 
hands-free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription for prevent-
ing the stiff neck that comes from wedging your BlackBerry against your ear 
with your shoulder. At the minimum, it helps free your hands so that you 
can eat Chinese takeout. Some places require you by law to use an earphone 
while driving (but only when you’re talking on a cellphone, of course).
 
We recommend that you avoid using your cellphone while driving, hands-free 
or not.
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard wired earphones. BlackBerry also 
supports cool wireless earphones based on Bluetooth technology. How could 
a bizarrely colored tooth help you here? Bluetooth is the name for a (very) 
short-distance wireless technology that connects devices. See Chapter 12 for 
how to connect your BlackBerry to a Bluetooth headset.
Chewing on Hardware
Reliability and quality were probably your main concerns when you decided 
on a BlackBerry. Will the product last? Will it perform like the manufacturer 
says? Will you regret having bought this item six months down the road?
The following sections look at some of the hardware features that make the 
BlackBerry device a wise purchase.
Saving power
Anyone with BlackBerry experience knows it’s a highly efficient power 
consumer.
The addition of a color, high-resolution screen, GPS and Bluetooth support 
have weakened the power efficiency. Power requirements have increased so 
much that you need to recharge roughly every two days. But hey, now you 
have a GPS on deck!

17
 Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Isn’t a Fruit
Putting a sentry on duty
The virtual world isn’t exempt from general human nastiness; in fact, every 
day a battle is fought between those who are trying to attack a system and 
those who are trying to protect it.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being cracked by 
a hacker or infected by a virus. Viruses try to replicate themselves and gener-
ally bug you.
Fortunately, security is a BlackBerry strong point. Viruses often come as 
e-mail attachments. However, BlackBerry supports very few file types out of 
the box (mostly images and documents). You won’t face threats from e-mails 
with these attachments. And data that you send to or get from the PDA is 
encrypted (coded) to prevent snooping.
 
RIM also has a Signature process for application developers that forces devel-
opers to identify themselves and their programs if they’re developing any 
applications for the BlackBerry that need to integrate with either BlackBerry 
core applications or the OS.
Remember the I love you and Anna Kournikova viruses? These are virtual 
evils transmitted through e-mail, scripts, or sets of instructions in the e-mail 
body or attachment that can be executed either by the host e-mail program 
or, in the case of an attachment, by the program associated with the attached 
file. Fortunately, BlackBerry’s Messages does not support scripting lan-
guages. BlackBerry’s viewer for such files doesn’t support scripting either, so 
you won’t be facing threats from e-mails having these attachments.
 
The security measures RIM implemented on the BlackBerry platform have 
gained the trust of the U.S. government as well as many of the Forbes Top 500 
enterprises in the financial and health industries.

egardless of whether you previously owned a BlackBerry, you might 
have heard that the new BlackBerry is totally different. You might 
be wondering how you spot a new BlackBerry. Looks aren’t deceiving in this 
case. From the outside, the new BlackBerry is a lot slimmer than the older 
BlackBerry handhelds. The new design has a brighter and higher-resolution 
screen. But what makes it fundamentally different is the fact that it has a 
trackball.
What? No more trackwheel? Where is the trackball? What can you do with it? 
How can you navigate your BlackBerry better with the trackball? Those are 
some of the questions that we answer in this chapter. Bear with us and you 
will be master of your BlackBerry in no time.
Anatomy 101: The Body and 
Features of Your BlackBerry
In this and the following sections, we show you all the keys and features on 
your BlackBerry Bold, Pearl Flip, or Curve 8900. The three models are shown 
in Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3, respectively.

First, the major features:
 
✓ Display screen: The graphical user interface (GUI) on your BlackBerry.
 
✓ QWERTY keyboard: The input for your BlackBerry — very 
straightforward.
 
✓ SureType keyboard: The input for your BlackBerry Pearl. We cover 
how to type with the SureType keyboard in the later section, “SureType 
keyboard.”
 
✓ Escape key: This key is used to cancel a selection or return to a previ-
ous page within an application. If you hold it down, it returns you to the 
Home screen from any program.

23
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
 
✓ Menu key: This key displays the full menu of the application you are 
using.
 
✓ Trackball: You navigate the display screen of your BlackBerry with the 
trackball. It allows you four directional movements. When you press 
the trackball, the short menu of the application you are using appears.
 
✓ Convenience keys: Depending on the BlackBerry model you have, you 
have one or two convenience keys. By default, the convenience keys are 
preprogrammed to open an application. In Chapter 3, we show you how 
to reprogram the convenience keys so that they display the programs 
you use the most.
 
✓ MicroSD slot: Although it is hidden inside your BlackBerry and can be 
revealed only by removing the battery, the microSD slot is a crucial ele-
ment to your BlackBerry media experience.
 
✓ Send key: Because your BlackBerry can also function as a cellular 
phone, this key allows you to go straight to the Phone application, 
regardless of which application you are currently using. When you are 
already in the Phone application, the Send key starts dialing the number 
you entered.
 
✓ End key: While on a phone call, use this key to end your call. If not on a 
phone call, this key allows you to jump straight back to the Home screen 
from wherever you are.
 
✓ Power key: Press and hold the Power key to turn your BlackBerry on or 
off. On the 8800, pressing Power also turns on an extra backlight. This 
feature is very useful when you’re in direct sunlight.
 
✓ Mute key: Mutes a call when on a call.
 
If you owned an older BlackBerry (one with a trackwheel), the Menu key 
essentially replaces the trackwheel click but with added functions, like quick 
access to the short menu. With the new BlackBerry, you can also click the 
trackball to confirm selection choices.
Two types of context menus can appear on your BlackBerry, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
 
✓ Full menu: This menu lists all the options and features you can perform. 
Full menu is access by pressing the Menu key.
 
✓ Short menu: This is an abbreviated list of the full menu (Figure 2-4). 
Short menu is access by pressing the trackball when you are not 
prompted by a dialog box.

Display screen
When you first turn on your BlackBerry, the display screen displays the 
Home screen, which is your introduction to the graphical user interface (GUI) 
of your BlackBerry. The different icons represent the different applications 
found in your BlackBerry. See Figure 2-5 for an example of what your Home 
screen might look like.
 
Depending on the theme you’re using, you might see your applications listed 
in text form rather than as icons. Remember that how your GUI looks depends 
on how you want it to look because the font and theme are customizable. For 
more on personalizing your BlackBerry, see Chapter 3.

 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
QWERTY keyboard
For those non–BlackBerry Pearl owners, this section is for you.
Unlike some PDA manufacturers — they know who they are — RIM chose as 
the input method for the BlackBerry the same QWERTY keyboard you know 
and love from your personal computer. We think that was a great decision 
because it means that we don’t have to master some new way of writing — 
graffiti or whatever — to get data into our BlackBerry. All we have to do is 
type on a familiar keyboard — and we already know how to do that.
Whether you use your pinky or your index finger, how you type on your 
BlackBerry is up to you. However, most people find that typing with two 
thumbs is the most efficient method.
SureType keyboard
 
If you have the BlackBerry Pearl, this section is for you. The Pearl doesn’t 
have a full QWERTY keyboard; rather, it works with a QWERTY-based key-
board known as the SureType keyboard. The idea is that many keys share 
letters (refer to Figure 2-2 to see how this looks) and that the SureType 
technology is smart enough to find what key combinations come up with the 
words you want. Basically, with SureType, you can now type with only one 
thumb, and your BlackBerry Pearl learns the words that you frequently use.
Here are tips to speed the learning curve when using SureType technology:
 
✓ Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType 
learns what you want to type next time.
 
✓ If SureType gets the word you’re typing right on the first try, simply 
use the Space key to move on instead of clicking the trackball or 
pressing Enter.
 
✓ Take advantage of Custom Wordlist, which is a list of words that you 
define. More on this later in the “Custom Wordlist” section.
 
✓ Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more 
you use it, the smarter it becomes in adapting to your style.
SureType versus multitap
On your Pearl, you can type in another mode: multitap. The regular way — at 
least we think of it as the regular way — is the multitap approach. The best 
way to explain multitap is by example: Say you want to type an h character 

26
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
on the Pearl. You search out the h on your keyboard but then notice to your 
dismay that the h shares a key with the letter g. What’s a person to do? Do 
you really want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?
Actually, there’s a perfectly easy solution to your problem. To get the letter g, 
you tap the GH key once. To get the letter h — the second letter in the key’s 
pair — you tap the key twice — hence, the term multitap.
What about SureType? When you are in SureType mode, your Pearl tries 
to help you do the communication thing by figuring out what word you are 
typing. For example, if you want to type the word hi, you start by pressing 
the GH key and then the UI key. Doing so prompts SureType to display a list 
of words it thinks might be what you’re aiming for, as shown in Figure 2-6. If 
the first listed word is what you want, simply press the Space key. The word 
is automatically selected, and you can continue to type. If what you really 
wanted to type appears a little later in the list, simply scroll to it by using the 
trackball and press the trackball to select it. Over time, SureType learns the 
words you’re most likely to use and sticks those at the top of the list. Yup, 
that’s right — it gets smarter the more you use it.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Now, did 
you want to 
type hi 
or gi?
 
Custom Wordlist
SureType keeps all the words it has learned in a safe place — a Wordlist, to 
be precise. It turns out that you can review your SureType Wordlist — and 
even add to it — using the Custom Wordlist option. (Using this option to add 
words or proper names to the list means that SureType doesn’t have to learn 
them when you are in the act of typing.)
To see or add words by using the Custom Wordlist option, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select the 
Options (wrench) icon.
 
2. Select Custom Wordlist.
 
 This opens Custom Wordlist. This is where you can see all the words 
that SureType has learned. (If you purchased your BlackBerry recently, 

27
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
there might be only a few words or even no words in this list, depending 
on how often you’ve used SureType mode to type.)
 
3. From within Custom Wordlist, press the Menu key and then select New.
 
 Doing so brings up a dialog box that prompts you to type in a new word, 
as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
4. To save your changes, press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Adding our 
favorite, 
btw, to 
Custom 
Wordlist.
 
Getting people’s names right is tough with SureType, but thankfully, you can 
make sure that SureType automatically learns all the names in Address Book 
as follows:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select the 
Options icon.
 
2. Select Language.
 
 You now see the Language option screen, where the handy Input Option 
button makes its home.
 
3. Scroll to the Input Option button and select it.
 
 This displays the Fast Options screen with the following options:
 
• Frequency Learning: If turned on, the word used most frequently 
appears first in the SureType Wordlist while you type.
 
• Auto Word Learning: If turned on, SureType learns as you type.
 
• Use Address Book as Data Source: If turned on, SureType learns all 
the names in your Address Book.
 
4. Make sure that the Use Address Book as Data Source option is 
turned on.
 
 If it isn’t, scroll to this field, press the trackball, and then select On from 
the drop-down list.
 
5. To save your changes, press the Menu key and then select Save.

28
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Escape key
Simple yet useful, the Escape key allows you to return to a previous screen or 
cancel a selection. The Escape key is the arrow key to the right of the trackball.
Trackball
You can perform two functions with the trackball: scrolling and pressing 
down. When you scroll with your trackball, you can navigate the display 
screen in four directions. In a text-filled screen such as the body of an e-mail, 
you can usually navigate through the text in four directions.
Depending on where you are on the BlackBerry’s screen, different situations 
determine what happens when you press the trackball, also called the track-
ball click:
 
✓ Display a drop-down list: When you are in a choice field, pressing the 
trackball displays a drop-down list of choices for that field.
 
✓ Confirm a choice: The trackball can also function as a confirmation key. 
For example, when you need to select a choice in a drop-down list, you 
can press the trackball to confirm the highlighted choice.
 
✓ Display a short menu: When you are in a text-filled screen (e-mail body 
or Web page), pressing the trackball displays a short menu (refer to 
Figure 2-4, right), which is just an abbreviated version of the full menu. 
You get the full menu by pressing the Menu key.
Menu key
The Menu key brings up the full menu for the application you are using. 
When you are on the Home screen, pressing the Menu key displays a list of 
applications installed on your BlackBerry. If you want to change the order of 
the applications in the list, see Chapter 3.
 
When you are on the Home screen, the behavior of the Menu key depends 
on the BlackBerry theme. The behavior just described is based on the 
default theme. See Chapter 3 for more on changing themes.

29
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
The microSD slot
Your BlackBerry comes with some internal memory, 1GB if you have the 
BlackBerry Bold. If you are a music or video fan, you know that 1GB is not 
going to keep you entertained for a long commute. But no need to worry. 
The folks at Research In Motion have incorporated a microSD slot into your 
BlackBerry so that you can add extended memory and store all the media 
files you want in your BlackBerry.
You can purchase a microSD card separately for a relatively low price these 
days. At the time of this writing, a 4GB microSD card costs about $20.
General Navigation Guidelines
In the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book, as well as throughout the book, 
we show you shortcuts that are application specific. In this section, however, 
we go over general shortcuts and navigation guidelines. On a Web page or an 
e-mail full of text, you can perform the following tasks:
 
✓ Move to the top of the page: Press the T key.
 
✓ Move to the bottom of the page: Press the B key.
 
✓ Move to the top of the next page: Press the Space key.
 
✓ Select a line: Press and hold the Shift key and scroll the trackball 
horizontally.
 
✓ Select multiple lines: Press and hold the Shift key and scroll the track-
ball vertically.
 
✓ Copy selected text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the trackball.
 
✓ Cut selected text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the Delete key.
 
✓ Paste text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the trackball.
 
✓ Insert an accented character: Hold down a letter key and scroll the 
trackball.
 
✓ Insert a symbol: Press the Sym key and press the letter below the 
symbol.
 
✓ Cap lock: Press the Alt and right Shift keys.
 
✓ Num lock: Press the Alt and left Shift keys.

30
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
Here are the keys for the BlackBerry Pearl:
 
✓ Num lock: Press Shift and Alt.
 
✓ Move to the top of the page: Press the ER key.
 
✓ Move to the bottom of the page: Press the CV key.
 
✓ Move to the next page: Press the M or Space key.
 
✓ Move to the previous page: Press the UI key.
 
✓ Move to the next line: Press the BN key.
 
✓ Move to the previous line: Press the TY key.
 
✓ Switch between multitap and SureType mode: When typing in a text 
field, press and hold the * key.
Switching applications
When you are navigating in an application, an option called Switch 
Application appears when you press the Menu key. Switch Application, which 
is similar to Alt+Tab in Windows, lets you multitask between applications 
(see Figure 2-8).
 
Figure 2-8: 
Switch 
Application 
menu.
 
Another way to switch applications is to press the Alt and Escape keys. (The 
Alt key is located to the left of the Z key, and the Escape key is the arrow key 
to the right of the trackball.)
 
If you always use a particular application, such as the Tasks application, you 
can program the convenience key so that you can get to your favorite applica-
tion even more quickly than by using the Switch Application function.

31
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
Changing options
Throughout this book, you see examples of an options field being changed to 
a different value. The easiest way to change the value in a field is to first use 
the trackball to scroll to the field. Then press the trackball to display a drop-
down list of choices (see Figure 2-9), and finally press the trackball again on 
your choice.
 
Figure 2-9: 
An example 
of an option 
field’s drop-
down list.
 
General Keyboard Shortcuts
 
If you have a BlackBerry Pearl or Pearl Flip, this section does not apply to you. 
All the shortcuts described here are for QWERTY-based BlackBerry models only.
In many instances in this book, when we ask you to go to a BlackBerry appli-
cation (Profile, for example), you have to first scroll to it from the Home screen 
and then click the trackball. You might be thinking “Hey, there must be a short-
cut for this,” and you’re right. This and the following sections cover such gen-
eral keyboard shortcuts, all in the name of making your life easier. (Shortcuts 
that are more application-specific are covered in the chapter dealing with the 
particular application.)
Before you get all excited about shortcuts, you need to take care of one bit 
of housekeeping. To use some of these general keyboard shortcuts, you first 
have to make sure that the Dial from Home Screen setting — buried deep 
within the Phone application — is turned off.

32
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Inquiring minds want to know, so we’ll tell you. The Dial from Home Screen 
option is designed for users who make frequent BlackBerry phone calls. If 
you are not a frequent phone user and want to access all applications with a 
press of a button, get ready to ditch Dial from Home Screen.
Here’s how to turn off the Dial from Home Screen setting:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, highlight the Phone application 
and then press the trackball.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select the Options icon.
 
 A screen that lists a range of options appears.
 
3. Select General Options.
 
 The General Options screen appears.
 
4. Highlight the Dial from Home Screen field and then select No.
 
 Doing so shuts down the Dial from Home Screen option, enabling you to 
use Home screen shortcuts.
 
5. To confirm your changes, press the trackball and then select Save 
from the menu that appears.
 
If you’re a frequent phone user on your BlackBerry, as opposed to an e-mail or 
Internet user, you might not want to turn off the Dial from Home Screen 
feature.
Using Home screen shortcuts
After you disable the Dial from Home Screen feature, you are free to use any 
Home screen shortcut. (The name for these shortcuts is actually a pretty 
good fit because you can use these shortcuts only while you are on the Home 
screen.)
Other Pearl shortcuts
The Pearl has a few other shortcuts you may 
find useful:
 ✓ Switch between current profile and vibrat-
ing profile: From the Home screen, press 
and hold the # key. If you don’t know what a 
profile is, refer to Chapter 3.
 ✓ Key lock your Pearl: From the Home screen, 
press and hold the * key.

33

Okay, here goes. To call up the application listed in the first column of 
Table 2-1, press the key listed in the table’s second column.

Other (non-Home screen) shortcuts
The following shortcuts can be used at any time, regardless of which screen 
you’re currently in — or whether you have Dial from Home Screen enabled, 
for that matter:
 
✓ Soft Device Reset (also known as the 3-Button Salute): Pressing Alt+
cap+Del forces a manual soft reset, which is just what you need when 
your BlackBerry has crashed or when you install an application and it 
needs a manual reset. A hard reset can be done by pulling out the battery 
from the back of the BlackBerry. What’s the difference between a soft 
reset and a hard reset? Without getting into the technical jargon, from a 
BlackBerry user’s perspective, a hard reset takes longer and is usually the 
last resort to solve any issues before contacting the help desk.
 
✓ HelpME: In the BlackBerry world, SOS is actually spelled Alt+cap+H. Use 
it when you’re on the phone with technical support. (It gives support 
personnel info such as your BlackBerry PIN, memory space, and version 
number so that they have information about your BlackBerry when they 
try to troubleshoot your problems.)

34
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
 Note: Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a security password; rather, it is a 
unique number that identifies your BlackBerry, sort of like a serial 
number. But unlike a serial number, you can message another BlackBerry 
by using PIN-to-PIN messages. For more on PIN-to-PIN messages, see 
Chapter 8.

egardless of how long you’ve had your BlackBerry — one week, one 
month, one year, or five years — you’ll want to have it around for 
as long as you possibly can. (Or, at least until you have the bucks for that 
way-cool new model that’s surely coming down the pike.) And, for the 
duration that you do have your device, you’ll want to trick it out so that 
your BlackBerry doesn’t feel and sound exactly like the millions of other 
BlackBerry devices out there. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry is defi-
nitely a fashion statement, so you better feel comfortable with what that 
statement is saying.)
In addition to customizing your BlackBerry so that it expresses the inner you, 
you want to make sure that you keep your BlackBerry in tip-top shape by 
watching out for things such as your BlackBerry battery life and information 
security. Luckily for you, this chapter puts any and all such worries to rest by 
filling you in on all you need to know to keep your BlackBerry a finely tuned 
(and yet quirkily personal) little PDA.
Making Your BlackBerry Yours
BlackBerry devices are increasingly popular, so much so that close to 8 
million BlackBerry smartphones are out there serving the needs of people 
like you. Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish 
your BlackBerry from your colleagues’ is high on your list of priorities.

36
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
Your wish is our command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in 
the following sections and you, too, can have your very own personalized 
BlackBerry.
Branding your BlackBerry
Like any number of other electronic gadgets that you could possibly own, 
your BlackBerry comes to you off the shelf fitted with a collection of white-
bread factory settings. This section helps you put your name on your 
BlackBerry, both figuratively and literally. You can start by branding your 
name on your BlackBerry. Follow these steps:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, and then press the 
trackball.
 
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Owner setting and 
then press the trackball.
 
 You see places to enter your owner information.
 
3. Enter your name in the Name field and your contact information in 
the Information field.
 
 The idea here is to phrase a message (like the one shown in Figure 3-1) 
that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan who might find 
your lost BlackBerry and want to get it back to you.
 
 If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry for a while, the standby screen 
comes on, displaying the owner information that you entered. Read how 
to lock your BlackBerry, either manually or by using an auto setting, in 
the later section “Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe.”
 
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing 
Save from the menu that appears.
 
Figure 3-1: 
List your 
owner 
info here, 
shown on a

37
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
Choose a language, any language
Branding your BlackBerry with your own John Hancock is a good start, but set-
ting the language to your native tongue so that you don’t need to hire a transla-
tor to use your BlackBerry is equally important — and equally easy. You can 
also set your input method of choice here, which can affect whether AutoText 
shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what that means in the next section.
Here’s how you choose a language:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options (wrench) icon, and then 
press the trackball.
 
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting 
and then press the trackball.
 
 Here you can choose the language and input method of your choice.
 
3. Select the Language field and then scroll the drop-down menu to 
select your native tongue.
 
 Depending on your network provider, as well as what region (North 
America, Europe, and so on) you’re in, the language choices you have 
can vary. Most handhelds sold in North America default to English or 
English (United States).
 
 If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages into 
your BlackBerry by using Application Loader in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager. For more information on Application Loader, see Chapter 19.
 
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing Save.
 
 Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s on the screen? But don’t 
think that you’re finished quite yet. You still have some personalizing to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry user has to admit that typing on a full key-
board is easier than thumb-typing on a BlackBerry. In an attempt to even the 
score a bit, your BlackBerry comes equipped with an AutoText feature, which 
is a kind of shorthand that can cut down on how much you have to type. 
Even if you have the BlackBerry Pearl with SureType technology, you can still 
benefit by using the AutoText feature. (For more on SureType technology, 
see Chapter 2.)
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up — 
you then just type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with that 
abbreviation. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word for 
because, anytime you type b/c, you automatically get because on-screen.

38
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
Your BlackBerry comes with a few default AutoText entries. Here are some 
useful ones:
 
✓ mypin — displays your BlackBerry PIN.
 
✓ mynum — displays your BlackBerry phone number.
 
✓ myver — displays your BlackBerry model number and OS version.
 
The whole AutoText thing works best if you set up your own personal code, 
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we’re discussing 
AutoText as part of our personalization discussion.) To set up your own code, 
do the following:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, 
and then press the trackball.
 
2. Scroll to the AutoText option, and then press the trackball.
 
 Here, you can choose to see (or search for) existing AutoText words or 
create new ones.
 
3. Press the Menu key, scroll to New, and then press the trackball.
 
 The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
4. In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace (in 
this example, b/c). In the With field, type what replaces your charac-
ters (in this example, because).
 
Figure 3-2: 
Create 
AutoText 
here.
 
 
5. In the Using field, choose between the SmartCase and Specified Case 
options.
 
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for 
that, such as the first word in a sentence.
 
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text found in 
the With field.

39
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
 
 For example, say you have the AutoText bbg set up for the term black-
berryGoodies.com and you want it to appear as is, in terms of letter 
cases (the first b is not capitalized). If you were to choose SmartCase 
for this particular AutoText, it would be capitalized as the first word in 
a sentence, which is not what you want. On the other hand, if you use 
Specified Case, your AutoText always appears as blackberryGoodies.com 
no matter where it is in the sentence.
 
6. Scroll to the Language field and then select All Locales from the list 
of options.
 
 Our preference for this setting for any self-created AutoText is All 
Locales. What this means is that regardless of the language input 
method (for example, English UK or English US or French), any self-cre-
ated AutoText is available for you to use. So, in the case of the AutoText 
bbg (blackberryGoodies.com), whether you are typing in French or 
Chinese, you can use this AutoText. On the other hand, if you select 
only the French input method for bbg as the Language field, you would 
be able to use this only if your input method is set to French in the 
Language option.
 
 You can choose the input method in the Language options. We go over 
choosing a language input method next.
 
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing 
Save.
If you specify a language input method other than All Locales, your input 
method setting in the Language option must match the Language field in 
AutoText to use your newly created AutoText. Follow these steps:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, and then press the 
trackball.
 
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting, 
and then press the trackball.
 
 Here you can choose the language and input method.
 
3. Select the Input Method field and then select the input method you 
need from the list.
 
 For your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t choose 
All Locales as the language for your AutoText), this option needs to 
match the input method set in your Language option.
 
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing Save.

Getting your dates and times lined up
Having the correct date, time, and time zone is important when it comes to 
your BlackBerry for, we hope, obvious reasons. Many of the fine features 
that make up the BlackBerry core experience, as it were, depend on the time, 
date, and time zone being accurate.
Need an example? How about your BlackBerry calendar events? Imagine, if 
you will, that you have set up a make-or-break meeting for 9 a.m. (in your 
time zone) with a client in Paris, France, which is in who-knows-what time 
zone. You definitely want to be on time for that appointment, but you prob-
ably won’t be if you’re planning on having your BlackBerry remind you — 
that is, if you haven’t set up the appropriate date, time, and time zone. Follow 
these steps to do that:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, and then press the 
trackball.
 
2. Scroll to the Date/Time setting and then press the trackball.
 
 The Date/Time screen appears.
 
3. Scroll to your time zone and press the trackball.
 
 The Date/Time screen confirms the time zone that you chose.
 
4. Scroll to the Time field and use the trackball to adjust the proper hour 
and minutes.
 
5. Scroll to the Date field and use the trackball to adjust the date 
appropriately.
 
6. Scroll to the Date/Time Source field and press the trackball.
 
 This sets your date and time source to your service provider’s server 
time. See Figure 3-3.
 
7. To confirm your changes, press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 Doing so saves your date and time settings in perpetuity — a really long 
time, in other words.
Customizing your screen’s look and feel
Right up there with making sure that your date and time settings are accurate 
is getting the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. Now we 
know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or Bookman 
as long as you can read the text, but we also know that some of you won’t stop 

41
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
configuring the fonts until you get them absolutely right. For all you tweakers 
out there, here’s how you play around with your BlackBerry’s fonts:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, and then press the 
trackball.
 
2. Scroll to the Screen/Keyboard setting and then press the trackball.
 
 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields, 
as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
3. Highlight the Font Family field and then select a font from the drop-
down list.
 
 You can choose from three to ten fonts, depending on your provider.

4. Continuing down the Screen/Keyboard screen, highlight the Font Size 
field, and then select a font size.
 
 One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the font size, the more you 
can see on-screen; however, a smallish font is harder on the eyes.
 
 Note: As you scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, notice 
that the text The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 
in the background takes on the look of the selected font and size so that 
you can preview what the particular text looks like. (In case you were 
wondering, this sentence uses every letter in the alphabet.)
 
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and choosing Save.
Similar to setting Font Size, you can also play with Font Style to set it to Bold, 
Italic, or Plain.
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen 
as well as a few other viewing options, including how to program the 
Convenience key to exactly what is convenient to you:
 
1. Press the Menu key, scroll to the Options icon, and then press the 
trackball.
 
2. Scroll to the Screen/Keyboard setting and then press the trackball.
 
 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with its various customizable 
fields. (Refer to Figure 3-4.)
 
3. Highlight the Backlight Brightness field and then select the desired 
brightness from the drop-down list.
 
 You can choose from 0 to 100, where 0 is the darkest and 100 is the 
brightest.
 
4. Highlight the Side Convenience Key Opens field and then select what 
you want your left-side key to open when you press it.
 
 If you have a BlackBerry Pearl, you see Left Side and Right Side 
Convenience Key options. Perform Step 4 for both the left- and 
right-side Convenience keys.
 
5. Select the Backlight Timeout field, press the trackball, and choose the 
amount of time for the backlight timeout.
 
 You can choose from ten seconds up to two minutes. The lower this 
setting, the less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key). 
However, a low setting helps you conserve battery life.
 
 
When you’re outdoors with a bright sun on your BlackBerry, you’ll prob-
ably have difficulty reading your BlackBerry screen. Press and quickly 
release the Power button (in the upper-left corner of your BlackBerry). 
This brightens your BlackBerry screen so that you can see it even under 
a bright sun.

43
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
 
6. Highlight the Trackball Horizontal Sensitivity field and then select 
how sensitive you want the trackball to be horizontally.
 
 You can choose from 20 to 100, where 20 is the least sensitive and 100 is 
the most sensitive.
 
7. Highlight the Trackball Vertical Sensitivity field and then select how 
sensitive you want the trackball to be vertically.
 
 Again, 20 is the least sensitive, and 100 is the most sensitive. Keep in 
mind that if your trackball is too sensitive, it will be hard to control.
 
8. To confirm your changes, press the Menu key and select Save.
Choosing themes for your BlackBerry
Your BlackBerry is preloaded with different themes, which are predefined 
sets of looks (wallpaper, fonts, menu layout) for your BlackBerry. You can 
download themes from BlackBerry’s mobile Web site.
Regardless of what BlackBerry model you have, follow these steps to change 
your theme:
 
1. Press the Menu key and then select the Options icon.
 
2. Select the Theme setting.
 
 You see a list of available themes.
 
3. Scroll to and select the theme you want.
 
 You see a preview of the theme you’ve selected. See Figure 3-5.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Activate.
 
 You should be able to see the change immediately.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Preview of

You can download other themes. Just remember that you have to use your 
BlackBerry, not your PC, to access the following URLs:
 
✓ http://mobile.blackberry.com
 
✓ http://blackberrywallpaper.com
Wallpaper for your BlackBerry
Like your desktop PC, you can customize the BlackBerry Home screen with 
personalized wallpaper. You set an image to be your BlackBerry Home screen 
background by using the BlackBerry Media application. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select the Media 
application.
 
 This opens the Media application, where you see different categories: 
Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.
 
2. Scroll to and select the Picture category.
 
 Doing so brings up two folders: The Preloaded Media folder stores pic-
tures that came with your BlackBerry, and the Device Memory folder 
stores pictures that you took with your camera.
 
3. Scroll to and select one of the folders.
 
 This lists all the pictures in the folder.
 
4. Select the picture you want to use for your Home screen background.
 
 The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Set as Home Screen Image.
 
 The picture is now your new Home screen wallpaper.
 
6. Press and hold the Escape key (to the right of the trackball) to return 
to the Home screen and see the result.
You can download free wallpapers from the following Web sites (as long as 
you use your BlackBerry, not your PC, to access the URLs):
 
✓ http://mobile.blackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrywallpapers.com
 
✓ www.blackberrygoodies.com/bb/wallpapers
After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you want, there’s 
just one thing left to do before you can move on. You need to get your 
BlackBerry to sound the way you want it to.

45
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
Let freedom ring
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little 
electronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes 
this is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know 
when an appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has 
arrived, and so on. Basically, your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it knows 
something it thinks you should know, too. Figure 3-6 lists the kinds of things 
your BlackBerry considers bark-worthy, ranging from browser alerts to tasks 
deadlines.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Set 
attention-
needy 
applications 
here.
 
Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks 
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, whereas 
other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their BlackBerry 
under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are well aware of 
this and have devised a great way for you to customize how you want your 
BlackBerry to bark at you — they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile, or you can create 
your own profile. The upcoming sections take a look at both approaches.
Whether you create your own profile or customize a predefined profile, each 
profile is divided into seven categories that represent the application for 
which you can define alerts:
 
✓ Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push, which is just 
a Web page sent to your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Calendar: Alerts you when you have upcoming appointments.
 
✓ Level 1 (urgent e-mail messages): Alerts you with a special tone when you 
have an urgent e-mail. What’s considered an urgent message? E-mail can be 
defined as urgent by your sender. Also, a BlackBerry PIN-to-PIN message 
can be considered urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN, see Chapter 8.

46
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Messages [Email]: Alerts you when a new e-mail message is in your inbox.
 
✓ Phone: Alerts you if you have an incoming call or a new voice mail.
 
✓ SMS Text: Alerts you when you have an SMS message.
 
✓ Tasks: Alerts you of an upcoming to-do deadline.
You can personalize all the listed applications according to how you want to 
be alerted. Because the way you customize them is similar, we use one appli-
cation, Messages, as an example in the text that follows, as we customize a 
predefined profile that comes with your BlackBerry.
After this, we go over creating a profile from scratch. You might be wonder-
ing: Why do I need to create a profile if I can personalize the predefined ones? 
Well, for those of you who like to keep the predefined settings the way they 
are, creating a profile is the way to go.
Using factory settings
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded profile, just do 
the following:
 
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Profile application.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles (Quiet, Vibrate, 
Normal).
 
2. Scroll to the end of the list and select Advanced.
 
 A screen appears listing different profiles.
 
3. Scroll to the Normal profile in the list, press the Menu key, and then 
select Edit.
 
 The Normal screen appears, listing the applications with alert capabili-
ties that we mention in the preceding section. (Refer to Figure 3-6.)
 
4. Select the Messages [Email] application.
 
 You’re faced with the Messages for Normal profile, which is divided into 
an Out of Holster section and an In Holster section, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
A holster (in this context) is simply the belt clip or case that houses your 
BlackBerry while you’re not using it. BlackBerry is smart enough to know 
when it is in a holster.
 
 You can choose another application and follow the next steps to 
personalize the other applications listed in each profile.
 
5. Highlight the Out of Holster field and then select a tone from the drop-
down list of alert options.
 
 Doing so enables sound in the Out of Holster mode.

47
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
 
Figure 3-7: 
Choose 
a tone to 
alert you 
when your 
BlackBerry 
is out of its 
holster.
 
 
6. Highlight the Ring Tone field and then select the tune you like from 
the drop-down list.
 
 As you scroll through the tunes and pause, your BlackBerry plays the 
tune so that you know what it sounds like before you change it.
 
7. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
As you might have guessed from how Messages in the Normal profile is 
divided, your BlackBerry can notify you in different ways based on whether 
your BlackBerry is in plain view (Out of Holster) or tucked away next to your 
belt (In Holster). To set up a different sound for In Holster mode, just put the 
necessary info in the fields for the In Holster section — and be sure to choose 
a different tune this time. (Choosing the same tune kind of defeats the pur-
pose, doesn’t it?)
 
If you’re like us and you get more than 200 e-mails daily, you probably don’t 
want your BlackBerry sounding off 200 times a day. You can set up your 
BlackBerry so that it notifies you only if an e-mail has been marked as urgent, 
requiring your immediate attention. You can do this by setting the notifica-
tion for your Messages application to None for both In Holster and Out of 
Holster. Then in the Level 1 option (refer to Figure 3-6), you can set your 
desired notification for both In Holster and Out of Holster. That way, you 
have conveniently filtered out any unnecessary e-mail notifications, leaving 
just the urgent stuff to sound off to you.
Creating your own profile
You need to know which applications on your BlackBerry have alert capabili-
ties because you can then personalize each “Hey, you!” to your liking. You 
can have your BlackBerry so personalized that you can tell whether you have 
a phone call or an incoming message just by how your BlackBerry sounds.

48
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
If you’re already familiar with the different applications and are clear how 
you want each one to alert you, go on and create your own profile. As we 
mentioned before, you can achieve the same result by personalizing the pre-
defined profiles that come with your BlackBerry. But if you are one of those 
who like to keep the predefined profiles the way they are, create a new pro-
file by following these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Profile application.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles (Quiet, Vibrate, 
Normal).
 
2. Scroll to the end of the list and select Advanced.
 
 A screen appears listing different profiles.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select New.
 
 A new Profile screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-8, prompting you to 
name your profile.
 
Figure 3-8: 
A menu that 
lets you 
create your 
own profile.
 
 
4. In the Name field, enter a name for your profile.
 
 For this example, just type My Profile.
 
5. Configure your new profile.
 
 Refer to Steps 3 through 7 of the previous section to customize each one 
of the seven applications.
 
6. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 Your newly created profile appears in the Profile screen.
 
7. Select My Profile, as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
 Doing so allows you to start using your newly created profile.

49
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
 
Figure 3-9: 
See your 
newly 
created 
profile here.
 
 
You can switch between your current profile and the Quiet profile by pressing 
and holding the # key. This works on all BlackBerry smartphone models.
Regardless of whether the ring tone is for an incoming call or an incoming 
e-mail, you can download more ring tones to personalize your BlackBerry. 
Also, you can use any MP3 files in your Media application as your personal-
ized ring tone. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select the Media 
application.
 
 This opens the Media application, where you see different categories: 
Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.
 
2. Select the Music category.
 
 Doing so brings up folders named Preloaded Media and Device Memory. 
If you have a microSD card inserted, you also see the Media Card folder.
 
3. Select one of the folders.
 
 This lists all the music in this folder.
 
4. Highlight the music file you want to use for your ring tone.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Set as Phone Tune.
 
 This sets the music file as your new phone tune.
 
6. Press and hold the Escape key (to the right of the trackball) to return 
to the Home screen.
You can also download free ring tones at http://mobile.blackberry.

Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
The folks at Research In Motion take security seriously, and so should you. 
Always set up a password on your BlackBerry. If your BlackBerry hasn’t 
prompted you to set up a password, you should immediately do so. Here’s 
how it’s done:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Options (wrench) icon.
 
2. Select the Password option.
 
3. Highlight the Password field and then select Enabled.
 
 All this does for now is enable the Password feature. You won’t be 
prompted to type a password until you save the changes you just made.
 
4. Click the Set Password button.
 
 At this time, you should be prompted to enter a new password, as 
shown in Figure 3-10.
 
 Note that if you have set a password before, the button will be called 
Change Password.
 
5. Type a password, and then type it again for verification.
 
 From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry and want to 
use it again, you have to type the password. How do you lock your 
BlackBerry? Good question. Keep reading.
 
Remember that when you set your password on a BlackBerry Pearl, you 
must make sure that you know what letters your password uses and not 
just which keys you pressed. You need the same password if you link your 
BlackBerry with BlackBerry Desktop Manager for synchronization. For more 
on BlackBerry Desktop Manager, refer to Chapters 15, 16, 18, and 19.
 
Figure 3-10: 
It’s time to 
enter a new 
password.
 

51
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — And Keeping It Happy
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password 
won’t help much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry 
when you’re not using it. (You don’t want people at the office or sitting at 
the next table at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone his-
tory when you take a bathroom break, do you?) So, how do you lock your 
BlackBerry? Let us count the ways . . . we came up with two.
You can go the Autolock after Timeout (also known as Security Timeout) 
route by following these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Options icon.
 
2. Select the Password option.
 
 The Password screen appears.
 
3. Highlight the Security Timeout field and then select the desired 
minutes.
 
 The preset times range from 1 minute to 1 hour.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 If you’re more the hands-on kind of person, you can go the Manual Lockout 
route by scrolling to the keyboard Lock icon on your Home screen and press-
ing the trackball. (Pressing K while at the Home screen does the same thing. 
Make sure to turn off the Dial from Home Screen option. See Chapter 2 for 
more info on using Home screen shortcuts.)
As a shortcut, to lock your BlackBerry, just press and hold the asterisk (*) key.
No matter what route you take to lock your Blackberry, you use your (newly 
created) password to unlock it when you get back from wherever you’ve been.
Block That Spam
With your existing BlackBerry OS, you can block certain e-mails, SMS num-
bers, or BlackBerry PINs from getting to your inbox. It’s like having your own 
spam blocker on your BlackBerry!
To set up your personal spam blocker, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Options icon.
 
2. Select the Security option.

52
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 
 
3. Highlight the Firewall option and press the trackball.
 
 This opens the Firewall screen.
 
4. Highlight the Status field and select Enable.
 
 This enables the spam blocker.
 
5. Under Block Incoming Message, make sure what you want to block is 
selected:
 
• SMS: Select this check box if you want to block SMS messages.
 
• PIN: Select this check box if you want to block BlackBerry PIN 
messages.
 
• BlackBerry Internet Service: Select this check box if you want to 
block e-mail messages (for example, the e-mail account that you 
set up from Google or Yahoo! mail).
 
• Enterprise Email: Select this check box if you are within a large cor-
porate e-mail network and want to block the enterprise e-mail.
 
6. In the Except Messages From area, select the desired options:
 
• Contact: Select this check box if you want to block everything 
except the e-mails and phone numbers in your Contacts.
 
• Specific Address: Select this check box if you want to block every-
thing specified by you (you can set up the list below).
 
7. Press the Menu key and select Configure Exception.
 
 This opens the Firewall exception screen.
 
8. Press the Menu key and select the desired options:
 
• Add Email: You can specify the e-mail you want to block by select-
ing this check box.
 
• Add PIN: You can specify the BlackBerry PIN you want to block by 
selecting this check box.
 
• Add Phone Number: You can specify the SMS number you want to 
block by selecting this check box.

Part II
Getting Organized 
and Productive with 
Your BlackBerry

In this part . . .
T
his part covers how to use your BlackBerry to its fullest 
to get — and keep — you organized. Peruse the chapters 
here to find out how to use Contacts, keep appointments, 
keep on track with to-do lists, and keep your passwords 
safe and easy to retrieve.

Chapter 4
Keeping Track of Your 
Acquaintances
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring BlackBerry Contacts
▶ Adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts
▶ Transferring contacts from cellphones to your BlackBerry
▶ Finding a contact in Contacts
▶ Organizing Contacts
▶ Sharing BlackBerry contacts
T
he idea of storing contacts was around long before the BlackBerry was 
conceived. The Contacts feature (formerly called Address Book) on the 
BlackBerry serves the same function as any list of contacts: It is an organiza-
tional tool that gives you a place to record information about people. This tool 
gives you a central place from which you can retrieve information so that you 
can reach your contacts by phone, cellphone, e-mail, snail-mail, or the speedy 
messaging of PIN, SMS, MMS, or BlackBerry Messenger. Depending on the type 
of work you do, Contacts is likely an essential tool, and your BlackBerry is 
there at the ready.
You can benefit from using BlackBerry Contacts if you answer yes to any of 
the following questions:
 
✓ Do you travel?
 
✓ Do you meet clients frequently?
 
✓ Do you spend a lot of time on the phone?
 
✓ Do you ask people for their phone number or e-mail address more 
than once?

56
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Do you carry around the old-fashioned paper day planner with a section 
allocated for recording contacts? Or do you write phone numbers of 
acquaintances on the back of business cards?
 
✓ Is your wallet or purse full of these “important” business cards, but you 
can never seem to find the ones you need when you need them?
Regardless of how you keep your contact information, it’s time to get down to 
business and organize your contacts by using your BlackBerry. In this chapter, 
we show you how to make your BlackBerry a handy, timesaving tool for man-
aging your contacts’ information. Specifically, you find out how to add, change, 
and delete contacts as well as how to locate them later. You’ll also be amazed 
at how well Contacts is integrated with all the other BlackBerry features you’ve 
come to know and love — phoning contacts, adding invites to your meetings, 
adding contacts to BlackBerry Messenger, and composing e-mails.
 
If you’re one of those, um, stubborn folks who insist that you don’t need 
Contacts — “I’m doing just fine without it, thank you very much!” — think of it 
this way: You’ve been using a virtual contact list all the time — the one buried 
inside your cellphone. And that address book often isn’t even a very good one! 
When you’re ready to join the rest of us in this millennium, read this chapter 
to see how to transfer all that good contact info from an old phone into your 
new BlackBerry-based Contacts.
Accessing Your Contacts
The good people at Research In Motion make it easy for you to find Contacts. 
Start by taking a look at the BlackBerry Home screen. The Contacts icon 
looks like an old-fashioned address book. (Remember those?) If you have a 
hard time locating it, Figure 4-1 shows what it looks like in both BlackBerry 
incarnations. (For more information about the BlackBerry models and their 
differences, check out this book’s Introduction.) To describe Contacts in this 
chapter and for most of the illustrations throughout this book, we use the 
BlackBerry Bold model.
Opening Contacts couldn’t be simpler. Follow these steps:
 
1. Use the trackball to highlight the Contacts icon.
 
2. Click the trackball.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Enter.
 
Your BlackBerry Contacts feature is accessible from a number of applications, 
including Phone, Messages, and Calendar. For example, say you’re in Calendar 
and you want to invite people to one of your meetings or appointments. Look 
no further — Contacts is on the menu, ready to lend a helping hand.

You can also get to Contacts by pressing A while at the Home screen. Go to 
Chapter 2 for more on Home screen shortcuts.
Working with Contacts
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting because you just know that your 
newest toy is chock-full of features you’re dying to try out. Imagine having 
a new BlackBerry, for example. The first thing you’ll want to do is try to call 
or e-mail someone, right? But wait a sec. You don’t have any contact infor-
mation yet, which means you’re going to have to type in someone’s e-mail 
address each time you send an e-mail — what a hassle.
It’s time to get with the plan. Most of us humans — social creatures that we 
are — maintain a list of contacts somewhere, whether in an e-mail program 
such as Outlook or Lotus Notes, in an old cellphone, or maybe on a piece of 
paper kept tucked away in a wallet. We’re pretty sure that you have some 
kind of list somewhere. The trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry 
device so that you can access the info more efficiently. The good news for 
you is that the “getting contact info into your BlackBerry device” trick isn’t a 
hard one to master. Stick with us, and you’ll have it down pat by the end of 
this chapter.
 
Often the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry is 
to enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time and energy in 
maintaining some type of contacts application on your desktop computer, 
you might want to hot-sync that data into your BlackBerry. (For more on 
synchronizing data, check out Chapter 15. It gives you details on how to syn-
chronize some of your desktop application data — contacts, e-mails, appoint-
ments, and memos stuff.) You can also transfer your old cellphone contacts to 

58
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
your BlackBerry. Intrigued? Then check out the “Transferring Contacts from 
Cellphones” section, later in this chapter. Do you have an address book in 
another smartphone, such as a Palm Treo or a Windows Mobile? No problem. 
Most of these devices allow you to sync to a desktop computer application 
such as Outlook. But this is not a book about other smartphones, so please 
refer to your other device’s instructions on how to sync it to your desktop. 
After the data is in the desktop, you can check out Chapter 15 for details on 
synchronizing it to your BlackBerry.
Creating a contact
Imagine you’ve just run into Jane Doe, an old high school friend you haven’t 
seen in years. Jane is about to give you her number, but you don’t have a pen 
or pencil handy to write down her information. Are you then forced to chant 
her phone number to yourself until you can scare up a writing implement? 
Not if you have your handy BlackBerry device on you.
With BlackBerry in hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Contacts application.
 
 Contacts opens. You can also access Contacts from different applica-
tions. For example, see Chapter 7 to find out how to access Contacts 
from Messages.
 
2. Highlight Add Contact and then press the trackball.
 
 The New Contact screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
3. Scroll through the various fields, stopping and entering the contact 
information that you feel is appropriate.
 
 Use your BlackBerry keyboard to enter this information. For an overview 
of the different keyboard types, see Chapter 2. Note, however, that all 
BlackBerry keyboards look (and work) alike. When entering an e-mail 
address, press the Space key to insert an at symbol (@) or a period (.).
 
 We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact infor-
mation. You should strive to enter as much info as you possibly can. 
Maybe the benefit won’t be obvious now, but in the future when your 
memory fails you or your boss needs a critical piece of info that you just 
happen to have at the ready, you’ll thank us for this advice.
 
 To create another new blank e-mail field for the same contact, press the 
Menu key and then select Add Email Address. You can have up to three 
e-mail addresses per contact.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
Figure 4-2:

 If a contact has an extension for his or her phone number, no problem. 
When calling such a contact from your BlackBerry, you can instruct 
BlackBerry to dial the extension after the initial phone number. When 
entering the phone number into the New Contact or Edit Contact screen, 
type the primary phone number, press the trackball, select Add Pause 
from the menu that appears, and then add the extension number.
 
4. When you finish entering the contact information, press the trackball 
and then select Save.
 
 At this point, you should see your Jane Doe added to the list, as shown 
in Figure 4-3.

Contacts 
screen after 
adding 
Jane Doe.
 
 
The menu is always available through the Menu key, but just for convenience, 
we prefer to use the trackball when a menu is available through it. Also, when 
a menu is available through a press of a trackball, it’s always a shortened 
menu list. The application is smart enough to figure out which menu items to 
display based on where you are.

Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Taking notes
The Notes field on the New Contact screen (you might need to scroll down 
a bit to see it) is useful for adding a unique description about your contact. 
For example, use the field to jog or refresh your memory with tidbits such 
as Knows somebody at ABC Corporation or Can provide introduction to a 
Broadway agent. Or perhaps your note is something personal, such as Likes 
golf; has 2 children: boy, 7 & girl, 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s up to you. 
Again, the more useful the information, the better it will serve you.
Adding your own fields
Perhaps you’d like to add contact information that doesn’t fit into any of 
the available fields. Although you can’t really create additional fields from 
scratch, you can commandeer one of the User fields for your own purposes.
The User fields are located at the bottom of the screen; you have to scroll 
down to see them. Basically, you can use these fields any way you want 
(which is great), and you can even change the field’s name. (Face it, User field 
is not that helpful as a descriptive title.) For example, you can rename User 
fields to capture suffixes (such as MD, PhD, and so on). Or how about profes-
sion, birth date, hobbies, school, or nickname? When it comes down to it, 
you decide what information is important to you.
 
Keep in mind, though, that changing the field name for this particular contact 
changes it for all your contacts.
To rename a User field, follow these steps:
 
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate to one of the User fields.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Change Field Name.
 
 Note: The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the 
cursor is in a User field.
 
3. Use the keyboard to enter the new User field name.
 
4. Press the trackball or the Enter key to save.
 
 You’re all set.
Adding a picture to a contact
Most modern phones can display a picture of the caller. And BlackBerry is 
no stranger to this neat feature. For this to work, you first need the obvi-
ous, a picture of your friend or acquaintance. After you have the picture in a 
digital format that your device supports, you can get it into your BlackBerry 
through e-mail or copy it to the microSD card. Don’t worry — we won’t leave 
you helpless if you don’t know how to get media to that microSD; Chapter 12 
is your gateway to media satisfaction.

61
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
After a picture is inside the BlackBerry, adding it to one of your contacts is a 
snap. Follow these steps:
 
1. On a contact’s Edit screen, press the Menu key and then select Add 
Picture (see Figure 4-4).
 
Figure 4-4: 
Add a 
picture 
here.
 
 
2. Use the trackball to navigate to the drive and folder that contain the 
picture.
 
 You can use multiple locations for storing media files such as pictures. 
Chapter 12 gives you the scoop.
 
3. Select the picture you want.
 
 The picture you choose is displayed in full on the screen.
 
4. Press the trackball and then select Crop and Save.
 
 You’re all set. Just save this contact to keep your changes.
 
5. Press the Menu key and select Save.
Assigning a tone
Oh no, you’ve been awakened with your BlackBerry ringing in your night-
stand. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could tell who’s calling? Ring tones help you 
decide whether to ignore the call or get up and answer it. Hopefully, you can 
easily switch to Sleep mode if you decide to ignore the call.
Follow these steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
 
1. Press the trackball and then select Add Custom Ring Tone from the 
menu (refer to Figure 4-4).

62
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
2. Press the trackball.
 
 A list of ring tones from which you can choose is displayed. You can 
also select Browse to navigate to the drive and folder containing the ring 
tone. You can use multiple locations for storing media files such as ring 
tones. Chapter 12 gives you the scoop.
 
3. Select the ring tone you want.
 
 The ring tone appears in the Custom Phone Tune field. To save these 
changes, save this contact.
 
4. Press the Menu key and select Save.
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you receive an e-mail message or get a call from someone, you have 
contact information in Messages or Phone. (RIM makes this easy for you 
because Messages and Phone can recognize phone numbers or e-mail 
addresses and then highlight that information for a quick cut and paste.) 
Maybe that info isn’t complete, but you definitely have at least an e-mail 
address or a phone number. Now, if you’re pretty sure that you’ll be corre-
sponding with this person and he or she isn’t yet listed in Contacts, it’s just 
logical that you’d want to add the information.
If you have a sharp eye, you might have noticed that Phone lists only outgo-
ing numbers. That’s half of what you need. Oddly enough, you can access 
the history of incoming phone calls inside Messages. To do so, in Messages, 
press the trackball and click View Folder on the menu that appears. Scroll 
and click Phone Call Logs.
 
Like e-mail, a call log entry stays in the list as long as you have free space in 
your BlackBerry. This could mean months or years depending on your model 
and usage. When BlackBerry runs out of space, it starts reclaiming space a 
chunk at a time by deleting read e-mails and phone call logs, starting from the 
oldest.
When you have an e-mail or a phone log open, just scroll to an e-mail address 
or a phone number and press the trackball while that piece of information is 
highlighted. An Add to Contacts option pops up on the menu. (This particu-
lar menu item is located at the bottom of the list, so you might have to scroll 
to see it.) Select Add to Contacts, and a new New Contact screen appears, 
prefilled with that particular piece of information. Now just enter the rest 
of the information you know about the person, and it’s ready to be saved to 
Contacts. This is just one more sign of BlackBerry’s ongoing attempt to make 
your life easier.

63
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
Viewing a contact
Okay, you just entered your friend Jane’s name into your BlackBerry, but you 
have this nagging thought that you typed the wrong phone number. You want 
to quickly view Jane’s information. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Contacts application.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and highlight the contact name you want and then press the 
trackball.
 
 Pressing the trackball or the Enter key while a name is highlighted is the 
same as opening the menu and choosing View — just quicker.
 
 View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. (It doesn’t bother showing fields in which you haven’t 
entered anything.)
 
Figure 4-5: 
View mode 
for a 
contact.
 
Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. Given that fact, your contact information is 
sure to change as well. If you want to keep the information you diligently put in 
Contacts current, you’re going to have to do some updating now and then.
To update a contact, follow these steps:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name, press the Menu key, and then 
select Edit.
 
 The Edit Contact screen for the contact name you selected makes an 
appearance.

64
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
 In Contacts (or any BlackBerry application, for that matter), displaying a 
menu involves a simple press of the Menu key. You see the Edit option 
on the menu right below View.
 
3. Scroll through the various fields of the Edit Contact screen, editing the 
contact information as you see fit.
 
 If you want to replace only a few words or letters located in the middle 
of a field (instead of replacing all the text), scroll the trackball while 
pressing and holding the Alt key (located to the left of the Z key) to posi-
tion your cursor precisely on the text you want to change. Then make 
your desired changes.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 The edit you made for this contact is saved.
 
When you’re editing information and you want to totally replace the entry 
with a new one, it’s much faster to first clear the contents, especially if you 
have a lot of old data. When you are in an editable field (as opposed to a 
selectable field), just press the Menu key and then select Clear Field. This fea-
ture is available in all text-entry fields and for most BlackBerry applications.
Deleting a contact
When it’s time to eradicate somebody’s contact information in Contacts 
(whether it’s a case of duplication or a bit of bad blood — yes, we admit to 
have occasionally stricken somebody from our Contacts list in a fit of pique), 
the BlackBerry OS makes it easy to delete a contact.
Here’s how to delete a contact:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name you want to delete, press the 
Menu key, and then select Delete.
 
 (If you don’t initially see the Delete option, scroll down to the bottom part 
of the screen.) A confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
3. On the confirmation screen, select Delete.
 
 The contact you selected is deleted and disappears from your contact list.

65
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
Figure 4-6: 
The con-
firmation 
screen 
when you’re 
about to 
delete a 
contact.
 
 
Sometimes dealing with the confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to 
delete several contacts in a row. If you are 100 percent sure that you want to 
ditch a number of contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by set-
ting the Confirm Delete option to No on the Contacts Options screen. See the 
“Setting preferences” section, later in this chapter, for more on Contacts 
Options.
 
It also pays to spend a little bit of time adding your own contact record(s). We 
recommend adding at least one record for your business contact info and one 
for your personal contact info. This saves you time having to type your own 
contact information every time you want to give it to someone. You can share 
your contact record by sending it as an attachment to an e-mail (see the later 
section, “Sharing a Contact”).
Transferring Contacts from Cellphones
Suppose you have an old cellphone that has served you well for many years. 
Most likely you’ve accumulated contacts on that phone by painstakingly 
typing them each time in the past. You’d really like to have the same contacts 
on your BlackBerry as you have on your cellphone, but you just cannot bear 
the thought of typing them all again. You think to yourself, “There has to be a 
way.” Good news: You’re right; there is.
Copying contacts from a SIM card
We’ve copied contacts from Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and Samsung cell-
phones — and in theory, our method should also work on other phones. The 
trick is to use the SIM card as an external storage device — sort of like a floppy 
disk. What exactly is a SIM card? The acronym stands for Subscriber Identity 
Module. The non-head-scratching definition describes an electronic chip that 

66
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
is capable of storing information such as your phone numbers and contacts. 
Basically, you store your old phone’s contact list on the SIM card, insert that 
SIM card into your BlackBerry, and then upload the contacts from your SIM 
card. (For all the gory details, check out the steps later in this section.)
This sounds easy to do, but it might be tricky depending on the type of phone 
you have. A caveat: You can do this only on a GSM phone. (GSM is short for 
Global System for Mobile Communications, probably the most popular stan-
dard for mobile phones in the world.) To tell whether you have a GSM phone, 
first check whether you have a SIM card. To do that, take out the battery of 
your cellphone. Behind it, you should see a SIM card, looking (we hope) like 
the one you see in Figure 4-7. If you don’t, your phone is not a GSM phone.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Transfer 
phone info 
from your 
cellphone 
with a 
SIM card.
 
If your cellphone is a GSM phone and you’re determined to forge ahead and 
transfer your cellphone contact info to your BlackBerry, we’re here to help. 
Obviously, we can’t give instructions for all the types of phones out there. 
For the purpose of showing you what’s what, we assume that you want to 
transfer the contacts on a Nokia 6300 phone to your BlackBerry. (Why the 
Nokia 6300? That’s the one the dartboard told us to use.) Please check the 
manual of your phone for the equivalent steps.
No more digressions! If you want to know the steps for copying contacts from 
a Nokia phone to a BlackBerry by using a SIM card, here they are:
 
1. Take out the SIM card buried inside your BlackBerry and put it in the 
Nokia phone.
 
 Most people are uncomfortable doing this, but taking out a SIM card and 
putting it back in is no big deal. The SIM card is usually behind the bat-
tery, so you have to slide or take off the back cover of the device to get 
to it. On the BlackBerry, the back cover has a groove where you can put 
your thumb and push the cover out. A Nokia phone has a simple locking 
mechanism — a notch that protrudes in the back of the phone — which 
you slide to take off the back cover. When the cover is off, remove the 
battery and you can see the SIM card. Slide the SIM card’s plastic enclo-
sure; it should pop open. You can then remove the SIM card from the 
enclosure.

67
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
 Because this step requires you to remove the batteries from both your 
BlackBerry and your Nokia phone, both devices are going to power off 
(obviously).
 
 We’re going to resuscitate both, starting with the Nokia. After you put 
the battery back in the Nokia phone, it resets, and you should see the 
display come up.
 
2. On the Nokia phone, select Names by pressing the top of the rightmost 
top button.
 
 Note that the display above the rightmost button shows Names. Names 
is the equivalent of Contacts. The phone displays a list of contacts.
 
3. Select Options by pressing the leftmost top button.
 
 The Names menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-8. Note the Mark All 
menu item.
 
 There is no trackball for scrolling and selecting, but you can use the middle 
button, which has a silver edge around it. You can scroll up by pressing 
the top silver edge or scroll down by pressing the lower silver edge.
 
4. Select Mark All.
 
 You can make the selection by pressing the middle button while Mark 
All is highlighted.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The Nokia 
6300 Names 
menu.
 

68
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
5. Select Options by pressing the leftmost top button.
 
 The Names menu appears.
 
6. Select Copy Marked.
 
 Another menu appears, displaying two options: From Phone to SIM Card 
and From SIM Card to Phone.
 
7. Select From Phone to SIM Card.
 
8. Select All and then select Keep Original from the menu that follows.
 
 A confirmation screen appears.
 
9. Select OK to confirm the copy.
 
 Your phone starts copying the contents of the Phone Book to the SIM 
card. While it’s making the copy, the screen displays a bar that moves 
back and forth. If you have many contacts on your phone, this process 
can take some time, so be patient. When the contacts are loaded into the 
SIM card, the screen displays the number of contacts that were copied. 
You can proceed with the next step.
 
10. Take out the SIM card from the Nokia phone and put it back into your 
BlackBerry.
 
 Reinserting the SIM card and battery resets your BlackBerry.
 
11. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
12. In Contacts, press the Menu key and then select SIM Phone Book.
 
 It might take some time to load the contacts from your SIM card; how 
long depends on how many contacts you’ve saved to the card. (You’ll 
see a progress bar on the screen.) After the contacts are loaded, they 
are listed on the screen, and you can start browsing or copying them to 
your Contacts list.
 
 The SIM Phone Book menu item is located toward the bottom of the 
menu, as shown in Figure 4-9. Depending on your model, you might need 
to scroll down to see it.
 
13. To copy a contact to Contacts, just highlight the contact, press the 
Menu key, and then select Add to Contacts.
 
 Your contact has now found its way to the BlackBerry Contacts. You can 
repeat this step for all the contacts you want to copy. Although this is 
a tedious process, it’s still a lot better than trying to type each one on 
your BlackBerry.

69
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances

Contacts 
menu,

SIM Phone 
Book option.
 
 
Keep in mind that SIM cards do have a limited capacity. If all your contacts 
don’t fit on the SIM card on your first try, here are two ways you can add left-
over contacts to your BlackBerry:
 
✓ One by one: If only one or two contacts are not included, you might be 
better off just typing them into your BlackBerry.
 
✓ In batches: If you have many more contacts left, you probably should 
try doing multiple saves. The trouble here is that you have to figure 
out what contact info was saved on your first try — which, of course, 
lets you know what you still have to copy. We recommend loading such 
contacts in batches. To do that, first delete the names from the SIM 
card after they are loaded onto your BlackBerry. (That gives you a clean 
slate.) Repeat Steps 2 and 4 from the preceding list, but when you get to 
Step 5, select One by One from the menu rather than All. This allows you 
to select the remaining contacts to copy to the SIM card one at a time, 
instead of copying the whole shebang one more time. When the remain-
ing contacts are in the SIM card, you can copy the second batch of 
names and load them to your BlackBerry by using the preceding steps. 
Repeat as needed.
Copying a contact to a SIM card
You can reverse the info-import process, too. That is, you can copy from your 
BlackBerry Contacts list to a cellphone. “Can this be done?” you implore. 
To which we reply, “Why, certainly, with a little help from two BlackBerry 
experts.” For, truth be told, this feature of Contacts is probably one of the most 
difficult tricks to figure out unless somebody shows you how it’s done:
 
1. Start by viewing the contact information.
 
 Follow the steps in the “Viewing a contact” section, earlier in this chapter.

70
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
2. On the view screen, scroll to a Phone Number field, press the Menu 
key, and then select Copy to SIM Phone Book.
 
 The Copy to SIM Phone Book feature (see Figure 4-10) shows up only 
when you position the cursor in a Phone Number field.
 
Figure 4-10: 
Copy 
BlackBerry 
info to a 
cellphone.
 
 
3. On the Phone Book Entry screen, press the trackball and then select 
Save.
 
 This operation is a snap, and the screen immediately returns to the view 
contact screen shown as a result of Step 1.
 
If your phone doesn’t recognize your BlackBerry SIM card, perhaps the phone 
is locked. Phone providers do this all the time: They lock the phones to their 
network, making it unusable in other networks. If this is the case, call your 
phone provider and ask for instructions on how to unlock your phone.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most of us have desktop applications that we use to maintain our network — 
you know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. A word 
to the wise: You do not want to maintain two Contacts lists — one in your 
BlackBerry and one on your desktop computer. That’s a recipe for disaster.
Luckily for you, RIM makes it easy to get your various contacts — BlackBerry, 
desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync. Your BlackBerry comes with Black-
Berry Desktop Manager (BDM), a collection of programs, one of which is 

71
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
Intellisync. Intellisync allows you to sync between your device and the PC 
software. It also allows you to set up and configure the behavior of the pro-
gram, including how the fields in the desktop version of Contacts map to the 
Contacts fields in your BlackBerry. But you’re not going to read about it here. 
For that, check out Chapter 15, which has complete details on how you can use 
the Intellisync feature of BlackBerry Desktop Manager to synchronize with the 
applications in your device — including, of course, your Contacts list.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through a combination of typing skills and the shuttling 
of data between various electronic devices — you’ve created a nice, long list 
of contacts in Contacts. Nice enough, we suppose, but useless unless you can 
find the phone number of Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing you see in 
Contacts when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 4-11.
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
 
1. In the Find field, enter the starting letters of the name you want to 
search for.
 
 Your search criterion is the name of the person. You could enter the last 
name or first name or both. The list is usually sorted by first name and 
then last name. As you type the letters, notice that the list starts shrink-
ing based on the matches on the letters that you enter. Figure 4-12 illus-
trates how this works.
 
2. Scroll and highlight the name from the list of matches.
 
 If you have multiple matches, use the trackball to scroll through the list 
to find the person’s name.
 
Figure 4-11: 
Your search 
starts here.
 

72
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 4-12: 
Enter more 
letters to 
shorten the 
potential 
contact list 
search.
 
 
 If you have a long list in Contacts and you want to scroll down a page at 
a time, just hold down the Alt key (it’s located to the left of the Z key) 
and scroll. You get where you need to go a lot faster.
 
3. Press the Menu key and select from the possible actions listed on the 
menu that appears.
 
 After you find the person you want, you can select from these options, 
as shown in Figure 4-13:
 
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 7 for more infor-
mation about e-mail.
 
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging feature 
unique to BlackBerry. With PIN-to-PIN, you can send someone who 
has a BlackBerry a quick message. See Chapter 8 for more details 
about PIN-to-PIN messaging.
 
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
 
• SMS: Starts a new SMS message. SMS stands for Short Messaging 
Service, which is used in cellphones. See Chapter 8 for more 
details about SMS.
 
• Send to Messenger Contact: Adds this contact to your contacts 
list in BlackBerry Messenger. (Note that this option appears only if 
you have BlackBerry Messenger installed.)
 
• MMS: Starts a new MMS message. MMS is short for Multimedia 
Messaging Service, an evolution from SMS that supports voice and 
video clips. See Chapter 8 for more details about MMS.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a letter key in error, press the Escape 
key (the arrow key to the right of the trackball) once to return to the origi-
nal list (the one showing all your contacts), or press the trackball once and 
select View All.

73
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
Figure 4-13:
 You get 
action 
options for 
the selected 
contact.
 
If you think you’re hallucinating when you notice that sometimes the item 
Email <contact name> or Call <contact name> appears on the menu 
and sometimes not, just relax. There’s nothing wrong with your eyesight or 
your mind. Contacts is smart enough to know when it’s appropriate to show 
those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, Call <contact 
name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same is true for e-mail 
and the personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions is 
a convenient way to find out whether you have particular information — a 
phone number or an e-mail address — for a particular contact.
 
In a corporate environment, your BlackBerry Enterprise server administrator 
might disable PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corporate 
e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the 
menu option PIN<contact name> won’t appear, even though you entered 
PIN information for your contacts. Note that you’ll still be able to receive a 
PIN-to-PIN message, but you won’t be able to send one.
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been a diligent boy or girl by adding your contacts to Contacts, and 
your list has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the contact 
information for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course) family, 
friends, and relatives. In fact, Contacts has grown so much that it holds hun-
dreds of contacts, and you start to notice that it now takes you more time 
to find somebody, especially when you can’t remember the name right away 
and are trying to explore the list knowing that when you see the name you’ll 
recognize it.
Imagine that you’ve just seen an old acquaintance, a sales rep for XYZ, Inc., 
and you want to greet the person by name. His name is on the tip of your 

74
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
tongue, but you just can’t remember it. However, if you saw his name on a 
list, it would jump right out at you. The trouble is that your list has 300-plus 
names, which would take you forever to scroll through — so long, in fact, 
that the person would surely come right up to you in the meantime, and 
you’d have to reveal the fact that you can’t remember his name. (How embar-
rassing.) In this scenario, the tried-and-true Find feature wouldn’t be much 
help. What you need is a smaller pool of names to search through so that you 
can stumble across the needed name much more quickly.
This isn’t rocket science. You’re going to want to do one of the following:
 
✓ Organize your contacts into groups: Using groups (as every kinder-
garten teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange something (in your 
case, contacts) to make them more manageable. How you arrange your 
groups is up to you because the organizing principle should be based 
on whatever makes sense (to you, at least) and fits the group you set up. 
For example, you can place all your customer contacts within a Clients 
group and relatives in a Family group. Then, instead of searching for 
names of individuals within one humongous list, you can search within a 
smaller, more manageable group.
 
✓ Set up your contacts so that you can use some kind of filter on them: 
Another way to organize and streamline how BlackBerry Contacts 
lists your contacts is to use the Filter feature in combination with 
BlackBerry’s Categories. (Categories is just another way that Contacts 
helps you filter contacts.) Using the Filter feature narrows the Contacts 
list to such an extent that you have to use only the trackball to scroll 
down and find your contact — no need to type search keywords, in 
other words.
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You find out how to 
use both methods in the next sections of this chapter.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Contacts — as opposed to any other kind of group 
you can imagine — is just a simple filter or category. In other words, a group 
just arranges your contacts into subsets without affecting the content of 
your contact entries. In Contacts itself, a group shows up in the contact list 
just like any other contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you select the 
group, the contacts associated with that group — and only the contacts asso-
ciated with that group — appear on-screen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a group, 
following these steps:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select New Group.
 
 A screen similar to that shown in Figure 4-14 appears. The top portion of 
the screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is 
where you add your list of group members.
 
Figure 4-14: 
An empty 
screen 
ready for 
creating a 
group.
 
 
3. In the New Group field, enter the name of the group.
 
 You can name the group anything, but for the sake of this example, we 
named the group Friends. After entering the name of the group, you’re 
ready to save it. But hold on a sec — you can’t save this group until you 
associate a member to it. To satisfy such a hard-and-fast rule, proceed 
to the next step to add a member.
 
4. Press the trackball and then select Add Member from the menu that 
appears.
 
 The main Contacts list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered for 
names to add to your new group list.
 
5. Select the contact you want to add to your new group list, press the 
trackball, and then select Continue from the menu that appears.
 
 Everybody knows a Rob Kao, so select him. You’ll notice that doing so 
places Rob Kao in your Friends group list, as shown in Figure 4-15. (Rob 
Kao, a coauthor of the book you’re holding, is a very popular fellow.)
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more friends to your list.
 
 After you’re satisfied, save your group.
 
7. Press the trackball and then select Save Group from the menu that 
appears.
 
 Your Friends group is duly saved, and you can now see Friends in your 
main Contacts list.

Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left-brainer or a right-brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? An Innie 
or an Outie? Dividing up the world into categories is something everybody 
does (no divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry 
divides your contacts into distinct categories as well.
By default, two categories are already set for you on the BlackBerry: the 
Business category and the Personal category. But why stop at two? Black-
Berry makes it easy to create more categories. In the following sections, you 
first find out how to categorize a contact, and then you see how to filter your 
Contacts list. Finally, you find out how to create categories.
Categorize your contacts
Whether you’re creating a contact or editing an existing contact, you can cat-
egorize a particular contact as long as you’re in Edit mode.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how 
that’s done:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight the contact, press the Menu key, and then select Edit.
 
 Contacts is now in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is exactly 
where you want to be.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select Categories.
 
 A Categories list appears, as shown in Figure 4-16. By default, you see 
only the Business and the Personal categories.

77
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
Figure 4-16: 
Default 
categories.
 
 
4. Press the Space key or the trackball to select the check box next to 
Personal.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 You are brought back to the Edit screen for this particular contact.
 
6. To complete your changes, press the trackball and then select Save 
(again) from the menu that appears.
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its category, 
which means you can filter your Contacts list by using a category. Here’s how:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Filter.
 
 Your Categories list makes an appearance. If you haven’t added any 
categories in the meantime, all you see here are the default Business and 
Personal categories.
 
3. Press the Space key or the trackball to select the Personal check box.
 
 Your Contacts list shrinks to just the contacts assigned to the Personal 
category, as shown in Figure 4-17.
 
Figure 4-17: 
The 
Contacts list 
after a filter 
is applied.
 

78
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
As you add more contacts to a category, you can also use the Find feature and 
enter the first few letters of the name to further narrow the search for a con-
tact. If you need a refresher on how Find works, see the “Looking for 
Someone?” section, earlier in this chapter.
Adding a category
Whoever thought the default categories — Business and Personal — were 
enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t have many 
acquaintances. BlackBerry makes it easy to add categories, so you can divide 
your world as much as you like. Just do the following:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Filter.
 
 You get a view of the default categories. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
 
3. Press the Menu key (again) and then select New.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, asking you to name the new category you 
want to create.
 
4. In the Name field, enter a name for your category and then press Enter.
 
 After you enter the name of the category, it’s automatically saved and 
you see the Filter screen, which lists all the categories, including the one 
you just created. Just press the Escape key (the arrow key next to the 
trackball) to get back to the Contacts main screen.
 
You might not be able to see special characters, such as a single quotation 
mark, on the keyboard. To enter a single quote, press the Alt key (it’s to the 
left of the Z key) and the Sym key to display the list of symbols. On the screen 
that follows, scroll and click the quote.
 
Note that the Contacts application won’t allow you to add a contact to a group 
if that contact does not have an e-mail address. (It’s very strict on this point.) 
If, however, you don’t have an e-mail address for someone you’d like to add to 
a group, skirt this roadblock by editing that contact’s information and putting 
in a fake (and clearly inactive) e-mail address such as notareal@email
address.no.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you’ll wish that your Contacts list were sorted 
differently. For example, there’s the day when you need to find the guy who 
works for ABC Company but has a foreign name that you can hardly pro-
nounce, let alone spell. What’s a body to do?

79
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
You’re in luck. Once again, the good people at RIM have anticipated this sce-
nario and have made available to you Contacts Options, which is a palette 
of tricks that you can use to navigate some out-of-the-ordinary situations. 
Contacts Options sports a very simple screen, as Figure 4-18 makes clear, yet it 
provides you with three important options that change how Contacts behaves:
 
✓ Sort By: Allows you to change the way the list is sorted. You can change 
the sort field criteria from First Name, Last Name, or Company from the 
menu choices. You can use the Space key to toggle among the choices. 
Remember that guy from ABC Company? You can use the Sort By option 
to sort by company. By doing that, all contacts from ABC Company are 
listed next to each other, and with any luck, the guy’s name will jump 
out at you.
 
✓ Separators: Allows you to change the dividers in the Contacts list. It’s 
purely aesthetics, but check it out — you might like the stripes.
 
✓ Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can 
have multiple people who happen to share the same name in your Contacts 
list. If it’s turned off, you get a warning when you try to add a name 
that’s identical to someone who already exists in your list. Maybe you 
are just tired and mistakenly try to add the same person twice to your 
list. Then again, sometimes people just have the same names — perhaps 
you know three people named John Smith. We recommend keeping the 
default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts with the same names.
 
✓ Confirm Delete: Allows you to display a confirmation screen for all 
contact deletions. You should always keep this feature turned on for 
normal usage. Because you could accidentally delete somebody from 
your Contacts list in many ways, this feature is a good way of minimizing 
those accidents.
 
Figure 4-18: 
Choose your 
sort type 
here.
 

80
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like any other 
fields on a BlackBerry application. You simply highlight the field, press the 
trackball, and select Change Option from the menu that appears. You then 
see a menu screen that allows you to select the possible option values. For 
example, Figure 4-19 shows the possible Sort By fields.
 
Figure 4-19:

Sharing a Contact
Suppose you want to share your contact information with a friend who hap-
pens to have a BlackBerry as well. A vCard — virtual (business) card — is 
your answer and can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry Land, a vCard 
is a contact in Contacts that you send to someone as an attachment to an 
e-mail. (Keep reading for more on sending vCards.) At the receiving end, the 
BlackBerry device (being the smart device that it is) recognizes the attach-
ment and informs the BlackBerry owner that he or she has the option of 
saving it, making it available for his or her viewing pleasure in Contacts.
Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than a Contacts contact attached to an 
e-mail, sending a vCard is a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to make 
sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to be able to receive the 
information.)
Here’s how you go about sending a vCard:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Messages application.
 
 The Messages icon may differ from theme to theme, but most themes 
use an image of a mail envelope, as shown in Figure 4-20.

81
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Compose Email.
 
 A screen appears, allowing you to compose a new e-mail. Your next step 
is to enter the name of the recipient of this e-mail.
 
3. In the To field, start typing the name of the person you want to receive 
this vCard. When you see the name in the drop-down list, highlight it 
and press the trackball.
 
 You are now presented with an e-mail screen with the name you just 
selected as the To recipient.
 
4. Enter the subject and message.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Attach Contact.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
Figure 4-20: 
Launch 
Messages 
here.
 
 
6. Highlight the name of the person whose contact information you want 
to have attached and then press the trackball.
 
 The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a 
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all 
you have to do is send your e-mail.
 
7. Press the trackball and then select Send from the menu that appears.
 
 You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right 
neighborly now?)
Receiving a vCard
If you’re the recipient of an e-mail that has a contact attachment, here’s how 
you save it to Contacts:

82
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
 
2. Select the e-mail that contains the vCard.
 
 The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
 
3. Scroll down to the attachment. When the cursor is hovering over the 
attachment, press the trackball and select View Attachment from the 
menu that appears.
 
 The vCard makes an appearance on-screen. Now save the contact in 
Contacts.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Add to Contacts.
 
 The vCard is saved and is now available in your BlackBerry Contacts list.
Searching for Somebody 
Outside Your Contacts
Does your employer provide your BlackBerry? Do you use Outlook or Lotus 
Notes on your desktop machine at work? If your answer to both of these 
questions is yes, this section is for you. BlackBerry Contacts has a feature 
that allows you to search for people in your organization, basically through 
Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook), IBM Domino (for Notes), or Novell 
GroupWise. Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes, 
namely, to facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment and to enable 
access to a database of names.
 
For you techies out there, these person databases are called Global Address 
Lists (GALs) in Exchange, Notes Address Books in Domino, and GroupWise 
Address Books in GroupWise.
If you want to search for somebody in your organization through a database 
of names, simply follow these steps:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Lookup.
 
 Some corporations might not have the Lookup feature enabled. Check 
with your IT department for more information.
 
 Although you access the Lookup feature inside Contacts, it actually is 
going beyond your device and into your company’s Exchange, Domino, 
or GroupWise database, depending on which e-mail server your com-
pany uses.

83
 Chapter 4: Keeping Track of Your Acquaintances
 
3. On the screen that appears, enter the name you’re searching for and 
then press the trackball.
 
 You could enter the beginning characters of either a person’s surname 
or first name. You are not searching through your contacts but through 
your company’s database, so this step might take some time to com-
plete depending on the criteria you entered.
 
 For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when doing 
your search. For example, searching for Dan yields more hits than 
searching for Daniel. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer 
hits you’ll get and the faster the search will be.
 
 While the search is in progress, you’ll see the word Lookup and the cri-
teria you entered at the top of the list. For example, if you enter Daniel, 
the top row reads Lookup: Daniel. After the search is finished, 
BlackBerry displays the number of hits or matches, for example, 20 
matches: Daniel.
 
4. Select the matches count to display the list of matches.
 
 A screen that displays the matching names based on your criteria 
appears. A header at the top of this screen details the matches dis-
played on the current screen as well as the total hits. For example, 
if the header reads something like Lookup Daniel (20 of 130 
matches), 130 people in your organization have the name Daniel, and 
BlackBerry is displaying the first 20. You have the option of fetching 
more by pressing the trackball and choosing Get More Results from the 
menu that appears.
 
 You could also add the name or names listed in this result to Contacts 
by using the Add command (for the currently highlighted name) or the 
Add All command for all the names in the list. (As always, press the 
trackball to call up the menu that contains these options.)
 
 When you think you’ve found the person you’re looking for, the next 
step is to check the information to make sure that you have the right 
person.
 
5. Select the person whose information you want to review.
 
 The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen. 
Information might include the person’s title; e-mail address; work, 
mobile, and fax numbers; and the snail-mail address at work. Any of that 
information gives you confirmation about the person you’re looking for. 
Of course, what shows up depends on the availability of this information 
in your company’s database.
This is one of the longest chapters in the book, but you’ve just explored a 
core application that you are going to use with your BlackBerry many times. 
If you’ve skipped some topics, you can always go back and refer to this chap-
ter in the future whenever a Contacts question comes to mind.

T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering 
time management and using their time wisely (and we’re not just talk-
ing about reading this book while you’re commuting to work). Many have 
discovered that there is no better way to organize their time than to use a 
calendar — a daily planner tool. Some prefer digital to paper, so they use a 
planner software program on their PC — either installed on their hard drive 
or accessed through an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest of the 
bunch, of course, use their BlackBerry handheld because it has the whole 
planner thing covered in handy form with its Calendar application.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (personal and work) 
in order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. 
What’s great about managing your time on a BlackBerry instead of on your 
PC is that your BlackBerry is always with you to remind you. Just remember 
that you won’t have any more excuses for forgetting that important quarterly 
meeting or Bertha’s birthday bash.
Accessing BlackBerry Calendar
 
 BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry core applications, like Contacts 
or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 2), so it’s easy to get to. 
From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select Calendar. Voilà! 
You have Calendar.

86
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, you’ll likely see the Day view, which is a 
default setting on the BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 5-1. However, you can 
change the Calendar view to a different one that works better for your needs:
 
✓ Day: This view gives you a summary of your appointments for the day. 
By default, it lists all your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 
✓ Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of your appoint-
ments. By using this view, you can see how busy you are in a particular 
week.
 
✓ Month: The Month view shows you every day of the month. You can’t 
tell how many appointments are in a day, but you can see on which days 
you have appointments.
 
✓ Agenda: The Agenda view is a bit different from the other views. It 
isn’t a time-based view like the others; it basically lists your upcoming 
appointments. And in the list, you can see details of the appointments, 
such as where and when.
Different views (like the week view shown in Figure 5-2) offer you a different 
focus on your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling 
needs and preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can even 
use a combination of views for a full grasp of your schedule.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Day view in 
Calendar.
 
To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select Calendar.
 
 Doing so calls up the Calendar application in its default view — more 
than likely Day view.

87
 Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments

2. Press the Menu key and then select the view of your choice from the 
menu that appears (shown in Figure 5-3).
 
 If you start from Day view, your choices are View Week, View Month, 
and View Agenda.
 
Figure 5-3: 
The 
Calendar 
menu lets 
you select 
different

Moving between Time Frames
Depending on what view of Calendar you’re in, you can easily move to the 
previous or next day, week, month, or year. For example, if you’re in the 
Month view, you can move to the next month (um, relative to the currently 
displayed month). Likewise, you can also move to the previous month. In 
fact, if you like to look at things in the long term, you can jump ahead (or 
back) a year at a time. (See Figure 5-4.)
You have similar flexibility when it comes to the other Calendar views. See 
Table 5-1 for a summary of what’s available.

All Things Appointments: Adding, 
Opening, and Deleting
After you master navigating the different Calendar views (and that should 
take you all of about two minutes) and you have Calendar customized to your 
heart’s content (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended) to set 
up, review, and delete appointments. We also show you how to set up a meet-
ing with clients or colleagues.
Managing multiple calendars
Like your e-mail accounts, you might have mul-
tiple calendars. For example, you might have a 
calendar from your day job and you might have 
a calendar from your personal life or softball 
club that you belong to. Whatever the reason, 
your BlackBerry has a great way for you to 
manage multiple calendars.
From Calendar Options, you see a screen simi-
lar to the following figure. The different color 
squares that represent different calendars — 
this gives you a better view of which event 
belongs to which calendar. For example, you 
can have your day job calendar as red and your 
softball club calendar as green. When you have 
two events conflict at the same time slot, you 
can better prioritize with the color.
To change the color of each calendar, follow 
these steps:
 1. Open Calendar.
 2. Press the Menu key and select Options 
Menu.
 
 This opens a screen similar to the following 
figure.
 3. Select a calendar of your choice.
 
 The calendar properties screen opens.
 4. Highlight the colored square and then 
select the desired color.
 5. Press the Menu key and tap the Save 
button.

 Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of informa-
tion: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related 
information about the appointment, such as the meeting’s purpose, its loca-
tion, and whatever additional notes are helpful.
 
In addition to your standard one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can also 
set all-day appointments. The BlackBerry can assist you in setting recurring 
meetings as well as reminders. Sweet!
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new one-time appointment, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select New.
 
 The New Appointment screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
3. Fill in the key appointment information.
 
 Type all the information regarding your appointment in the appropri-
ate spaces. You should at least enter the time and the subject of your 
appointment.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 This saves your newly created appointment.
Your new appointment is now in Calendar and viewable from any Calendar 
view. Also, keep in mind that you can have more than one appointment in the 
same time slot. Why? Well, the BlackBerry Calendar allows conflicts in your 
schedule because it lets you make the hard decision about which appoint-
ment you should forgo.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Set an 
appointment 
here.
 

92
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — for example, if you’re in corporate 
training or have an all-day doctor’s appointment — select the All Day Event 
check box on the New Appointment screen, as shown in Figure 5-7. You 
can do so by scrolling to the check box and pressing the trackball. When 
this check box is selected, you will not be able to specify the time of your 
appointment — just the start date and end date (simply because it doesn’t 
make sense to specify a time for an all-day event).
 
Figure 5-7: 
Set an all-
day event 
here.
 
Setting your appointment reminder time
Any appointment you enter in Calendar can be associated with a reminder 
alert — either a vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things up in 
your profile. (For more on profiles, see Chapter 3.) You can also choose to 
have no reminder for an appointment. From the New Appointment screen, 
simply scroll to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from 
none to 1 week before your appointment time.
 
Profile is simply another useful BlackBerry feature that allows you to custom-
ize how your BlackBerry alerts you when an event occurs. Examples of events 
are an e-mail, a phone call, or a reminder for an appointment.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes before the 
event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. You can choose your own 
default reminder time. Here’s how:
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Options.
 
 Doing so calls up the Calendar Options screen.
 
3. Select Default Reminder.
 
4. Choose a default reminder time anywhere from none to 1 week before 
your appointment.

93
 Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments
So from now on, any new appointment has a default reminder time of what 
you just set up. Assuming that you have a reminder time other than none, the 
next time you have an appointment coming up, you see a dialog box like the 
one shown in Figure 5-8, reminding you of the appointment.
 
Figure 5-8: 
You get a 
reminder 
dialog box if 
you want.
 
Creating a recurring appointment
You can set up recurring appointments based on daily, weekly, monthly, or 
yearly recurrences. Everyone has some appointment that repeats, such 
as birthdays or anniversaries (or taking out the trash every Thursday
at 7:30 a.m. — ugh).
For all recurrence types, you can define an Every field. For example, say you 
have an appointment that recurs every nine days. Just set the Recurrence 
field to Daily and the Every field to 9, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have the option 
to fill in other fields. If you enter Weekly in the Recurrence field, for example, 
you have the option of filling in the Day of the Week field. (It basically allows 
you to select the day of the week on which your appointment recurs.)
 
Figure 5-9:

If you enter Monthly or Yearly in the Recurrence field, the Relative Date 
check box is available. With this check box selected, you can ensure that 
your appointment recurs relative to today’s date. For example, if you choose 
the following, your appointment occurs every two months on the third 
Sunday until July 31, 2012:
Start: Sunday, June 21, 2009 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 21, 2009 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2012
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same except that 
Relative Date is not selected, your appointment occurs every two months, on 
the 21st of the month, until July 31, 2012.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of your 
appointments won’t be as complicated as this.
Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways:
 
✓ If you’ve set up reminders for your appointment and the little Reminder 
dialog box appears on-screen at the designated time before your appoint-
ment, you can view your appointment by clicking the box’s Open button. 
In the same dialog box, you can Snooze the reminder (refer to Figure 5-8).
 
✓ You can open the appointment from Calendar by going to the exact time 
of your appointment and viewing it there.
 
While looking at an appointment, you have the option of making changes (a 
new appointment time and new appointment location) and then saving them.
Deleting an appointment
Deleting an appointment is straightforward. When in Day or Week view, 
simply scroll to the appointment that you want to delete, press the Menu key, 
and select Delete from the menu that appears.

95
 Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments
 
If the appointment that you’re deleting is part of a recurring appointment, a 
dialog box pops up asking whether you want to delete all occurrences of this 
appointment or just this particular occurrence, as shown in Figure 5-10. After 
you make your choice, your appointment is history.

Appointments versus Meetings
Technically, any event in your Calendar counts as an appointment, whether 
it’s a reminder for your best friend’s birthday or a reminder of a doctor’s 
appointment for a checkup. However, when you invite people to an appoint-
ment or you get invited to one, regardless of whether it’s a face-to-face meet-
ing or a phone conference, that appointment becomes a meeting.
Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is similar to creating a Calendar appoint-
ment. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open Calendar.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select New.
 
3. Fill in the key appointment information (subject, location, and time).
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Invite Attendee.
 
 You’re taken to Contacts to select your meeting attendee.

96
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
5. From Contacts:
 
• If you have contacts in Contacts: Highlight the contact you want and 
press the trackball.
 
• If you don’t yet have contacts or if the one you want isn’t in Contacts: 
Select the Use Once option to enter the appropriate e-mail address 
and press the Enter key to finish and return to Calendar.
 
6. After returning from Contacts, you see the attendees in your Calendar 
meeting notice.
 
7. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 This action actually sends an e-mail to your meeting attendees, inviting 
them to your meeting.
Responding to a meeting request
Whether for work or a casual social event, you’ve likely received a meeting 
request by e-mail, asking you to respond to the meeting by choosing one of 
three options: Accept, Tentative, or Decline. (If it’s from your boss for an all-
staff meeting and you just can’t afford to decline again because it’s so close 
to Christmas bonus time, that’s an Accept.)
You can accept any meeting request from your managers or colleagues on 
your BlackBerry just as you would on your desktop PC. In the PC world, you 
respond to an e-mail request for a meeting by clicking the appropriate button 
in your e-mail client (Microsoft Outlook, for the vast majority of you). In the 
BlackBerry world, a meeting request also comes in the form of an e-mail; 
upon reading the e-mail, just choose Accept, Tentative, or Decline in the 
Messages application. Your response is sent back in an e-mail. We go into 
more detail about the Messages application in Chapter 7.
After you respond to the meeting request, the meeting is added to your 
Calendar automatically. If you have a change of heart later, you can change 
your response (yes, you can later decline that useless meeting after all) in 
Calendar, and the declined event disappears from your Calendar.

U
sing your BlackBerry as an organizational tool is one of the key themes 
in this book. And speaking of organization, what better proof of your 
impressive organizational skills could exist than the fact that you use task, or 
to-do, lists? Knowing what you need to do today, tomorrow, the entire week, 
or perhaps the whole month makes you more efficient on your job and in your 
personal life. The fact is that you not only need to know what your tasks are, 
but you also need to prioritize them — and reprioritize them, if necessary. And 
with your BlackBerry as your able assistant, you can.
In this chapter, we introduce you to your Blackberry device’s Tasks appli-
cation. Stick with us as we explore this valuable tool, jumping from creating 
and maintaining your to-do list to setting alerts for a recurring task in a single 
bound. We also throw in a few tips and tricks to make maintaining and search-
ing your Tasks list easier and faster. Of course, we can’t advise you on how to 
actually do the task after your BlackBerry calls your attention to it, but with 
your BlackBerry in your palm, you’re at least a step closer to clearing your 
desk. Finally, we also give you the scoop on keeping your passwords safe by 
using the Password Keeper application.
 
Even if you keep a to-do list on your desktop (Outlook, anyone?), consider 
switching to all BlackBerry, all the time. You’ll love the greater flexibility that 
comes with greater mobility. Or, if you just can’t give up your desktop applica-
tion, you have the option of using both applications and just synchronizing 
them. (More about that later in the chapter.)

Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Accessing Tasks
Tasks can be found in the Applications folder on the Home screen, as you can 
see in Figure 6-1. Just look for the icon of a clipboard with a check mark.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Going from 
Applications 
to Tasks.
 
 
The icons used by other providers might be different from what you see here. 
If this is the case for your BlackBerry, just remember that Tasks is always in 
Applications. If you can locate the Applications icon, it’s just a matter of 
pressing the trackball to locate the Tasks icon.
Recording a New Task
The first step when building a to-do list is to start recording one. Don’t groan 
and roll your eyes, dreading how long this will take. This is easy, so just relax 
and you’ll be finished in a snap.
Follow these simple steps:
 
1. Select Tasks.
 
 The Tasks application opens. Similar to Contacts and MemoPad, the 
screen that appears is divided into two parts: The top shows the Find 
field, followed by the list of tasks or *No Tasks*.
 
2. Highlight Add Task and press the trackball.
 
 Alternatively, you can press the Menu key and then select New (as shown 
on the left of Figure 6-2). The New Task screen appears, as shown on the 
right side of Figure 6-2, ready and willing to document your new task. 
This simple screen features easy-to-understand fields that describe the 
task you’re about to enter.

99
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
 
Figure 6-2: 
Select 
New and 
an empty 
task screen 
appears.
 
 
3. Use the trackball to move to each field and enter information 
for your task.
 
 Some fields are for text that you enter yourself, and some fields hold 
items you select from a menu specific for that field. In other words, for 
text fields, you have to type the stuff you want; but for nontext fields, 
you select the field, press the trackball again, and then make your 
choice from the selection that appears. (Pretty convenient, huh?) We 
explain all these fields in the next section of this chapter.
 
 To update a field from a list of choices, select that field and then press 
the trackball.
 
4. After filling in the relevant fields, press the Menu key and 
then select Save.
 
 Doing so saves your task, and you should see the task added to the 
Tasks list.
Navigating the Tasks Fields
The New Task screen (refer to Figure 6-2) is straightforward and contains few 
fields. Although the few fields there are self-explanatory, we (being the thor-
ough guys that we are) describe each one here.
Task field
Use this field to log the subject of your task or a short description of your task. 
Make this field as descriptive as you can: The subject you type here should be 
specific enough that you can differentiate this task from the rest in your list. 
For example, if you make several presentations to clients, you don’t want to 
call your task Prepare Presentations. You want to be specific so that you can 
distinguish it from other tasks. Perhaps name it Product X Benefit Forecast to 
XYZ CFO. You can search on this field from the main Tasks screen.

100
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Status field
Fill in the Status field to indicate the current state of your task. Status is a 
selection field — that is, after highlighting the field, you press the trackball 
and select a value from the list.
The choices you see give you a good idea of the field’s purpose. The 
following are the possible values you can choose from:
 
✓ Not Started: You haven’t started this task yet. Because this choice is the 
most common, Not Started is the default choice when creating a task.
 
✓ In Progress: You are in the midst of the task.
 
✓ Completed: You are finished with the task.
 
✓ Waiting: Your task is ongoing and depends on another task or another 
event. For example, you’re waiting for Joe in Accounting to get you 
a spreadsheet so that you can include it in your report and complete 
the task.
 
✓ Deferred: Your task is on hold. Maybe you just don’t need to work 
on this task at the moment, or you need more information before you 
decide whether this task is worth doing. Either way, you want to keep 
the task listed so that you can track it or resurrect it. Perhaps this task 
isn’t a big deal today, but it could become important in a month or two. 
By tagging a task as Deferred, you keep yourself aware of a task that 
might or might not ramp up.
Priority field
In the Priority field, you can specify the timeliness or urgency of the task. 
Like the Status field, the choices here are selections you make from a menu. 
You can choose from one of the following values:
 
✓ High: This is the highest possible setting. You should consider the most 
urgent task to be of high priority.
 
✓ Normal: This is the default value, which applies to most tasks. In reality, 
a Normal task can jump to become a high priority when it’s not finished 
in time, but you have to decide and assign that yourself.
 
✓ Low: Just like you’d surmise, a Low rating tags a task as being less 
critical — you can put this one off until you’re finished with the High 
and Normal tasks. You can rate all your nice-to-have tasks with this 
priority. Hint: When you’re finished with your High and Normal tasks, 
reprioritize your Low tasks.

101
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
Due field
Consider the Due field your task completion deadline. Here, you can enter 
a due date for your task. The default here is None; to change the value to a 
specified due date, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the field.
 
 A pop-up menu appears on-screen offering two options: None and 
By Date.
 
2. Select the By Date option.
 
 A date field appears on the next line, as shown in Figure 6-3. The value 
of the date defaults to the current date. If the current date is not your 
intended due date, proceed to Step 3 to change the value of this date.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Set a task’s 
due date 
here.
 
 
3. Select the specific portion of the date that you want to change.
 
 The portion of the date that you highlighted is now editable. The date 
portions that you can change are year, month, day, and time. Although 
this is a date field — like any date field in Tasks, for that matter — setting 
its value does not create an entry in Calendar.
 
4. Using the trackball, scroll to the specific date value you want and then 
press the trackball to accept the change.
 
 At this point, you should have the right value of the date component 
you want.
Note: Say you modified the day but you want a specific time on that day. 
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 but this time highlight (and edit) the time component of 
the date.

102
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
While you are specifying the due date, you might see the Recurrence and No 
Recurrence fields. These fields show up only when you select By Date in the 
Due field. Intrigued? Check out the “Creating Recurring Tasks” section, later 
in this chapter, for details about these fields.
Time Zone field
The Time Zone field holds the time zone related to the date fields used for 
this task: Due (preceding section) and Reminder (following section). If these 
fields have values of None, this field is irrelevant.
You can specify a time zone different from your locale. For example, if you 
live in New York and you anticipate completing this task in Mexico City, you 
can specify the Mexico City time zone. Then, all the times in this task become 
relative to Mexico City.
Reminder field
From the Reminder field (a date field), you can set an alarm or a notice on the 
date and time you specify. You can set it just like you would set the Due field. 
(See the earlier section “Due field.”) Setting a reminder is useful, especially 
for those important tasks that you can’t afford to forget (such as buying a 
birthday gift for your significant other).
Again, just like any date field in Tasks, setting its value does not make it show up 
in your Calendar. The type of reminder you get is based on your active profile. 
(See Chapter 3 for details on how to customize notifications in your profile.)
When the reminder date is met, BlackBerry notifies you and displays a 
reminder screen. On this screen, you will see the name of the task and pos-
sible actions: Open (opens the task), Mark Completed (shows up for a task 
with a status other than Completed), and Dismiss (closes the screen).
Categories field
Use the Categories field to assign a specific category that you can use to filter 
your Tasks list later. By default, this field is blank. However, you can easily 
assign a value to it from the Categories screen available through the context 
menu. We find that using the Categories field is important for organizing your 
list, so we describe it fully in the section “Organizing Your Tasks List,” later 
in this chapter.

103
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
Notes field
The Notes field is a free-for-all text field. You can put anything here you want, 
such as a detailed description of the task or any other info that relates to 
this task.
Updating Your Tasks
When it’s time to update your Tasks list — say, after finishing a high-priority 
task or when you want to change the due date for a specific task — the Tasks 
application won’t stand in your way. You can quickly go back to your Tasks 
list and update those records.
To update a specific task, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Tasks.
 
 The Tasks application opens to the Find screen, which displays your 
current Tasks list.
 
2. In the Tasks list, select the task you need to edit.
 
 The screen that opens is the same one you used to create the high-
lighted task, although obviously this display has fields filled with the 
information you already entered.
 
3. Update the fields.
 
 Go through each of the fields that you want to edit.
 
 Tasks and Notes fields are text fields that you can edit from here. To 
update the other fields, you have to highlight the field and then press 
the trackball to make those fields editable.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 This saves your task, and you can see the updated task in the Tasks list.
Deleting a Task
Just like folks make a ritual of spring-cleaning when winter fades, the same 
is true for your tasks. When a task is completed and keeping it just takes up 
space, simply delete it through your Tasks application.
In simple steps, here’s how:
 
1. Select Tasks.

104
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
 The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
 
2. Using your trackball, highlight the task you want to delete.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select Delete.
 
 You see the standard Confirmation screen.
 
4. If you’re sure that this task is doomed for the dustbin, highlight Delete 
on the Confirmation screen and press the trackball.
 
 The task is deleted, and your Tasks list is updated.
Organizing Your Tasks List
As time goes by, your Tasks list is sure to grow — which means that the time 
it takes to find a task in your list is sure to grow as well. One way to stay orga-
nized is to make it a habit to delete finished tasks from your list, as we detail 
in the preceding section. (The shorter the list, the better, we always say.) We 
recommend weeding out your Tasks list every time a project or a goal is com-
pleted. After all, when a particular project is completed, you probably don’t 
need to go back to the tasks you did for it.
 
If you’re someone who just loves to document everything you accomplish 
(or you work in an environment where you’re expected to keep a listing of 
tasks completed — can you say quarterly employee review?), you might not 
relish the idea of deleting any entry from your Tasks list. In that case, regu-
larly archive a copy of your entire Tasks list before you do any weeding, and 
you’ll have a complete record of every stitch of hard work you contributed 
to a project. To archive, synchronize your BlackBerry with your desktop 
and store the data in whatever time-management software you use on your 
desktop. BlackBerry can synchronize to personal as well as enterprise time-
management software. (For details on how to synchronize, see Chapter 15.)
After synchronization, you can print the Tasks list related to this completed 
project (via your desktop application), which you can file. Having a hard 
copy of those completed tasks can give you peace of mind as you delete 
tasks from your BlackBerry. The best of both worlds, right? You clean up 
your Tasks list (making it easier for you to do a search), and you have an 
archive (in case you need a historical reference).
Another way to stay organized is to sort your Tasks list. Even after you 
weed out tasks you’ve completed, you may still have difficulty finding a task 
from your list. Fear not; help is available. Chances are that when you look 
for a task, you know something identifiable about it, such as its priority or 
due date. Because you assign information about your task when you create 
it (see the earlier sections “Navigating the Tasks Fields” and “Updating 
Your Tasks”), you can use that information as part of a task sort in your 

105
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
BlackBerry. By default, your Tasks list is sorted by the name or subject of 
your task, but you can also sort by priority, due date, or status. For example, 
if you know the due date of your task, you can sort your list by due date and 
thus quickly find the task at hand.
“Sounds great,” you say, “but how do I change the sort criteria?” We’re glad 
you asked. Because changing how you sort basically involves customizing 
your BlackBerry device, we’re going to stick that discussion in the next 
section of the chapter.
Customizing tasks
You can make two — count ’em, two — Tasks customizations through the 
Options screen: sorting by criteria and toggling the deletion confirmation 
screen. Locating the Options screen from the Tasks application is easy. Just 
press the trackball and select Options. The Tasks Options screen appears, 
displaying two sections, Views and Actions, as shown in Figure 6-4. You can 
set the following here:
 
✓ Sort By: Here you can change how the list is sorted. The default task list-
ing is the alphabetical order of the subject from A to Z (no reverse). To 
change to a different sort field, follow these steps:
 
a. On the Tasks Options screen, highlight the Sort By field and then 
press the trackball.
 
 A list displays your sorting options. You can choose from Subject, 
Priority, Due Date, or Status.
 
b. Highlight your choice and then press the trackball.
 
✓ Snooze: For tasks with reminders, this option allows you to snooze the 
alarm. The default value is None, but you can set it to 1, 5, 10, 15, or 30 
minutes.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Change 
your Tasks 
sort options 
here.
 

106
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Confirm Delete: This option allows you to control whether you want the 
application to display a confirmation screen upon deleting an item from 
your list. In other BlackBerry applications, this option is common. These 
confirmations appear as a safety feature so that you don’t accidentally 
press Delete and lose something important. You can always turn this 
feature off in any of your BlackBerry applications, but we generally rec-
ommend that you keep the value of this field set to Yes, meaning that it 
prompts you for every delete.
 
 There are exceptions to every rule, however. When you begin to weed 
out a bunch of outdated tasks from your Tasks list, toggle this feature off 
so that you don’t get 27 prompts in a row when you’re deleting 27 items. 
(But toggle the feature back on when you’re finished weeding.)
 
 To turn off this feature, just do the following:
 
a. On the Tasks Options screen, select the Confirm Delete field.
 
 The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No (See Figure 6-5). 
No means you want to toggle off the Confirmation screen.
 
b. Select No.
 
 The Tasks Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm 
Delete field.
 
c. Press the trackball and then select Save.
 
 The Tasks application applies the change you made.
 
Another field you can see from the Tasks Options screen is Number of Entries. 
This field is just informational, showing you how many tasks you have in your 
Tasks application.

 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
Creating a category
Sometimes sorting on a specific criterion such as Subject or Due Date still 
might not give you a quick answer to what you’re looking for. For example, 
if you want to know how many more personal tasks you still have to do as 
opposed to the more business-oriented stuff you have going, sorting is of no 
help, right? What you really need is a way to filter your list based on certain 
groups that you define. (Personal versus Business would be a good start.) 
The good people at RIM anticipated such a need and introduced categories.
So what exactly is a category, and why is it important? A category is a way for 
you to group your tasks in a manner that you can come back to. The group-
ing is the category, and the listing with a certain category is a filter. To make 
a task part of a group or category, you simply assign it a category when you 
record a task, or you can update the task and assign it a category then. (See 
earlier sections in this chapter for how to do both.)
To make use of this feature, start by creating a category by following 
these steps:
 
1. Select Tasks.
 
 The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list on the Find 
screen.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Filter.
 
 The Select Categories screen appears (see Figure 6-6), listing all the 
available categories. The two default entries on the list are Business 
and Personal. By all means, feel free to use these default categories. 
Consider, though, that these categories are broad and might not be help-
ful if you have a lot of tasks. (Imagine going to a grocery store with only 
two sections: perishable and nonperishable.) Our advice to you: Go the 
extra mile and create some categories to work with.
 
 Strive to define groups or categories that are meaningful in your line of 
work and not so broad.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select New.
 
 The New Category screen appears, allowing you to define a new 
category. Imagine that.
 
4. On the New Category screen, enter your category name in the text 
field and then press the trackball.
 
 Doing so establishes your category and lists it as an option on the Select 
Categories screen. Refer to Figure 6-6.

108
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 6-6: 
Organize 
with 
categories.
 
You can define as many categories as necessary up front. This way, you 
won’t have to go back and create them. After you have the categories you 
want, assign your tasks to those categories.
 
One important aspect of categories you should be aware of is that they are 
shared among applications — specifically, among Contacts, MemoPad, and 
Tasks. This sibling relationship might sound trivial at first, but don’t make the 
common mistake of assuming that what you change in Tasks does not affect 
other BlackBerry apps. The case of categories would show you how wrong 
such assumptions are. The importance of this comes into play when you 
delete a category in an application. For example, if you’re working in Tasks 
and you decide to delete a category, you’ll soon discover that you’ve lost that 
category in Contacts as well — with all its assignments. (The Contacts contact 
is still intact but will be missing the category assignment.)
Assigning categories to your tasks
Here’s how to assign a category to an existing task while you’re in the Tasks 
application:
 
1. Select the task in the Tasks list.
 
 The Edit Task screen appears, ready for any changes you’d like to make.
 
2. Select the Category field.
 
3. In the list that appears, select the category.
 
 The category you selected is entered into the field.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 The task is now associated with the category you selected.

109
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
Filtering the list
As you can read in the two preceding sections, you create categories and 
assign them to your tasks. To see the tasks associated with a certain cat-
egory, just filter the list, which is way easy. Like all other options, Filter is 
available through the menu while you are in the Tasks application. Selecting 
that menu option gives you a screen that allows you to select any category 
listed. After you choose a category, the list is filtered so that only those tasks 
assigned to the chosen category are visible.
So much for the overview. Here are the nitty-gritty details:
 
1. Select Tasks.
 
 The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Filter.
 
 The Select Categories screen appears, listing all the available categories 
(refer to Figure 6-6).
 
3. Select the category you want.
 
 A filtered list appears, containing just the tasks associated with the chosen 
category. Note that the list has the category name as the heading, as 
shown in Figure 6-7.
After you have the necessary categories, divide your tasks into appropriate 
categories to make running a task sort easier.

A filtered 
task list.

Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Creating Recurring Tasks
A more advanced feature in Tasks is to create a recurring task — you know, 
one that repeats periodically. Maybe the recurring task is deadline driven, 
such as filing your taxes or paying bills, or buying presents for your signifi-
cant other for his or her birthday, for Valentine’s Day, or for an anniversary. 
(Other times, a recurring task might be something a bit more mundane, such 
as turning in a weekly status report to your boss.)
Making a task recur is simple, although it might not be obvious at first. (Rest 
assured; we show you the trick.) Basically, you either create a task from 
scratch or you use an existing task.
 
If you don’t see the Recurrence field while looking at your existing task, the 
task doesn’t have a due date — and it has to have a due date to make it a 
recurring task.
Say you want a task to repeat every year. With the Tasks application running, 
do the following to make the task recur on a yearly basis:
 
1. In the Tasks list, select the task you want to recur.
 
 The Edit Task screen for the specified task appears.
 
2. If the Due field on the Edit Task screen reads None, highlight the field, 
press the trackball, and then select By Date from the menu.
 
 The screen displays a Date field — short for Due Date. The default date 
is the current date, so if you haven’t yet changed the default date to 
your due date, do that now. (The “Due field” section, earlier in this 
chapter, has all the details on how to do this.)
 
 If you scroll down the screen, notice that the Recurrence field appears 
with a default value of None. Recurrence always appears after a due date 
is specified, so you will see it the next time you open this task.
 
3. Select the Recurrence field.
 
 Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly selections appear. These designate 
when your task recurs. For our current example, we want the task to 
repeat yearly.
 
4. Select Yearly from the list.
 
 At this point, your task recurs yearly, beginning on the date you speci-
fied in the Due field (Step 2).
Note: The End field below the Recurrence field is the end of the recurrence 
and comes in handy when you specify a relative reminder. For example, con-
sider the following:

111
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
Due: Mon, Dec 15, 2008 5:00 p.m.
Reminder: Relative
 
15 Min.
Recurrence: Yearly
Every: 1
End: Mon, Dec 15, 2010
Relative Date: (Checked)
Occurs every year until Dec 15, 2010
Your task will recur every December 15 of each year until 2010. You won’t 
see any difference in the behavior of this task versus a nonrecurring task. 
However, at 4:45 p.m. every December 15, you’ll get a reminder. By default, 
your BlackBerry will vibrate to alarm you (see Chapter 3 for details on cus-
tomizing your Tasks notification in Profiles).
Also, after the End field is a Relative Date check box field. To select/deselect 
this field, use the trackball to scroll and highlight the field and then press 
the Space key. Mark the Relative Date field if the date is not exact but rela-
tive on the day: For example, you want the task to recur every third Monday 
of December rather than every December 15. This field is associated to 
Recurrence and will appear only when it’s appropriate. In fact, you will not 
see this field for daily or weekly — only for monthly and yearly recurrence.
Using Password Keeper
Suppose you’re in front of an Internet browser, trying to access an online 
account. For the life of you, you just can’t remember the username that 
matches your password. It’s your third login attempt, and if you fail this time, 
your online account is locked. Then you have to call the customer hotline 
and wait hours before you can speak to a representative. Argghh! We’ve all 
done it. Luckily, the folks at RIM created an application just for people like 
you (and us) so that you never get locked out of your own online accounts 
again — and yet can keep intruders at bay.
Password Keeper is the simple yet practical BlackBerry application that 
makes your life that much easier.

112
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
Accessing Password Keeper
Whether it’s the BlackBerry Pearl Flip or Bold, Password Keeper is always 
filed in Applications (as shown in Figure 6-8).
 
Figure 6-8: 
Password 
Keeper 
in the 
Applications 
folder.
 
 
Not all BlackBerry devices come with Password Keeper out of the box. You 
may need to specifically request that your service provider install it on your 
BlackBerry. It is free, though.
Setting a password for Password Keeper
 
The first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted to enter a 
password. Be sure to remember the password you choose because this is 
the password to all your passwords. Forgetting this password is like forget-
ting the combination in your safe. There is no way to retrieve a forgotten 
password, unlike with many Web sites. In addition, you are prompted to 
enter this master password every time you access Password Keeper.
We know it sounds perverse to set up yet another password to help you 
manage your passwords, but trust us. Having to remember just one password 
is a lot easier than having to remember many.
Creating credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy-dandy Password Keeper appli-
cation. Now, what kinds of things does it expect you to do for it to work its 
magic? Obviously, you’re going to need to collect the pertinent info for all 
your various password-protected accounts so that you can store them in the 

113
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
protected environs of Password Keeper. So, when creating a new password 
entry, be sure you have the following information (see Figure 6-9):
 
✓ Title: This one’s straightforward. Just come up with a name to describe 
the password-protected account — My Bank Account, for example.
 
✓ Username: This is where you enter the username for the account.
 
✓ Password: Enter the password for the account here.
 
✓ Website: Put the Web site address (its URL) here.
 
✓ Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field does give you a bit of 
room to add a comment or two.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Set your 
password 
here.
 
 
The only required field is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t of much use to 
you. We suggest that you fill in as much other information here as possible, 
but at the same time be discreet about those locations where you use your user-
name and password — so don’t put anything in the Website field or use My 
eBay Account as a title. That way, if someone does somehow gain access to 
your password to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard time figuring 
out where exactly to use your credentials.
Random password generation
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything but knows 
deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, random pass-
word generation is for you. When creating a new password for yet another 
online account (or when changing your password for an online account you 
already have), fire up Password Keeper, press the trackball, and then select 
Random Password from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 6-10. 
Voila! A new password is automatically generated for you.

114
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 6-10: 
Generate 
a random 
password.
 
Using random password generation makes sense in conjunction with 
Password Keeper because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener-
ated password that Password Keeper came up with for any of your online 
accounts — that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry’s electronic 
brain do your password remembering for you. So, imagine this scenario: You 
can no longer live without owning your personal copy of the A Chipmunk 
Christmas CD, so you surf on over to your favorite online music store and 
attempt to log in. You draw a blank on your password, but instead of seeth-
ing, you take out your BlackBerry, open Password Keeper, and do a search. 
Like Contacts (see Chapter 4), you just type the first letters of your account 
title in the Find field to search for the title of your password. After you find 
(and highlight) the title, you press the trackball and the screen for your 
account appears, conveniently listing the password. All you have to do now 
is enter the password into the login screen for the online music store and 
Alvin, Simon, and Theodore will soon be wending their way to your address, 
ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle Bells.”
 
Yes, you do have the option of copying and pasting your password from 
Password Keeper to another application — BlackBerry Browser, for instance. 
Just highlight the password name, press the trackball, and select Copy to 
Clipboard from the menu that appears. Then navigate to where you want 
to enter the password, press the trackball, and select Paste from the menu. 
Keep in mind, for the copy-and-paste function to work for passwords from 
Password Keeper, you need to enable the Allow Clipboard Copy option in the 
Password Keeper options (see the upcoming Table 6-1). You can copy and 
paste only one password at a time.

115
 Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password
 
After you paste your password in another application, clear the Clipboard by 
pressing the trackball and choosing Clear Clipboard. The Clipboard keeps 
your last copied password until you clear it.
Password Keeper options
The Password Keeper’s Options menu, which is accessible by pressing the 
Menu key while in Password Keeper, allows you to control how Password 
Keeper behaves. For example, you can set what characters can make up a 
randomly generated password. Table 6-1 describes all these options.

If you want to change your master password to Password Keeper — the pass-
word for opening Password Keeper itself — simply follow these steps:
 
1. Select Password Keeper.
 
 The initial login screen for the Password Keeper application appears.

116
Part II: Getting Organized and Productive with Your BlackBerry 
 
2. Enter your old password to access Password Keeper.
 
3. With the Password Keeper application open, press the Menu key and 
then select Change Password.
 
 Doing so calls up the Password Keeper screen that allows you to enter 
new password, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
4. Enter a new password, confirm it by entering it again, and then use 
your trackball to click OK.

Your BlackBerry

In this part . . .
H
ere’s the good stuff — using your BlackBerry for 
e-mail (Chapter 7), text messaging (Chapter 8), 
going online and Web surfing (Chapter 9), and making those 
all-important phone calls (Chapter 10). Explore the camera 
that comes with the BlackBerry (Chapter 11) and have fun 
with its multimedia capabilities (Chapter 12). Get directions 
from the BlackBerry GPS (Chapter 13) and take advantage of 
must-have applications (Chapter 14).

Chapter 7
You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
▶ Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry
▶ Mastering e-mail basics
▶ Spell-checking your messages
▶ Searching your e-mail
▶ Saving messages
Your BlackBerry brings a fresh new face to the convenience and ease 
of use that we associate with e-mail. You can direct mail to your 
BlackBerry from up to ten e-mail accounts, from your work e-mail to personal 
e-mail from providers such as Yahoo! and AOL. You can set up an e-mail 
signature, configure e-mail filters, and search for e-mails.
In this chapter, we show you how to use and manage the mail capabilities 
of your BlackBerry to their full potential. From setup to sorts, we have you 
covered here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as T-Mobile, or Rogers, 
or Vodafone), you can set up your BlackBerry to receive mail from at least 
one of your current e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use 
to send and receive e-mail from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you 
can hook up your BlackBerry to use that same e-mail address. Instead of 
checking your Gmail from your desktop, for example, you can now get it on 
your BlackBerry.
 
Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten e-mail 
accounts to your BlackBerry. This provides you with the convenience of one 
central point from which you can get all your e-mail, without having to log on 
to multiple e-mail accounts. Such convenience!

120
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
In an enterprise environment, you might not be able to access the BlackBerry 
Internet Service (BIS) site to link your personal e-mail accounts to your 
BlackBerry, depending on your company policy. If you work for a Fortune 
500 company, most likely you can’t access the BIS. However, you can still 
configure e-mail settings (such as the BlackBerry e-mail filter and BlackBerry 
e-mail reconciliation) to make your e-mail experience that much better. If 
you’re an enterprise user, skip to the parts where you see the Enterprise 
icon to configure your e-mail settings. If you haven’t set up e-mail on your 
company-owned BlackBerry, see the upcoming section “Setting up e-mail in 
an enterprise environment.”
Using the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using the 
BlackBerry Internet Service client (formerly known as the BlackBerry Web 
client). The BlackBerry Internet Service client allows you to
 
✓ Manage up to ten e-mail accounts: You can combine up to ten of your 
e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry. See the next section for more 
details.
 
✓ Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match your 
BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn 
on wireless e-mail reconciliation and you’re good to go. For more on 
this, see the upcoming section “Enabling wireless reconciliation.”
 
✓ Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails so that you get only those 
messages that you truly care about on your BlackBerry. See the 
“Filtering your e-mail” section, near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client as an online e-mail account 
manager, but one that doesn’t keep your e-mails. Instead, it routes the 
e-mails from your other accounts to your BlackBerry (because it’s directly 
connected to your BlackBerry).
Combining your e-mail accounts into one
To start aggregating e-mail accounts (such as Gmail) onto your BlackBerry, 
you must first run a setup program from the BlackBerry Internet Service 
client. You can access the Service client from your BlackBerry or from your 
desktop computer.
To access the Service client from your PC, you need the URL that is specific 
to your network service. Contact your network service provider (T-Mobile, 
Verizon, and so on) directly to get that information.

121
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
After you’ve logged on to the Service client, you should see a screen similar 
to Figure 7-1. If your network provider has activated your BlackBerry, you 
should see one e-mail address, the default address of your BlackBerry.
From the Service client, you see three options on the left navigation bar. 
The E-mail Accounts option allows you to add, edit, and delete e-mail 
accounts. In addition, for each e-mail address, you can set up filters and 
an e-mail signature. We don’t cover the other two options because they’re 
used infrequently.
As mentioned previously, your BlackBerry already has a default e-mail 
address you can use to receive and send e-mail. If you don’t have any other 
e-mail account that you want to meld into your BlackBerry e-mail account, 
simply skip to the upcoming “Customizing Your E-Mail” section.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Set up 
an e-mail 
account 
here.
 
Adding an e-mail account
You can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your BlackBerry. To add an e-mail 
account to your BlackBerry account, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 7-1), click 
the Setup Account button.
 
 You see the add e-mail account screen.
 
2. Enter the e-mail address and logon credentials for that e-mail address:
 
• The e-mail address is the address from which you want to receive 
e-mail, for example, myid@yahoo.com.
 
• The account logon is the one you use to log on to this particular 
e-mail account.
 
• The password is the one you use with the logon.
 
3. Click the Next button.
 
 You’re finished. It’s that easy!

122
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
You can also manage your accounts from your BlackBerry. From the Home 
screen, press the Menu key and select Set Up Internet E-Mail. The rest is 
pretty much the same on the BlackBerry as it is on a PC.
 
We suggest that you first register and create your account by using your PC. 
Then for subsequent visits to the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you can 
use your BlackBerry. This way, you can minimize any errors or out-of-network 
coverage issues while setting up your account.
Setting up e-mail in an 
enterprise environment
 
This section is intended for those whose BlackBerry can’t receive and send 
e-mail yet — like when you first get your BlackBerry or you swap an old one 
for a new one. If your e-mail function works properly on your BlackBerry, you 
can skip this section.
Follow these steps to activate your BlackBerry for enterprise use:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Enterprise 
Activation.
 
 The Enterprise Activation screen opens, with two fields for you to fill in:
 
• Your corporate e-mail address, for example, myaccount@
abcCompany.com
 
• The password that your IT department gives you.
 
2. Type your corporate e-mail account along with the appropriate 
password.
 
 If you don’t know these pieces of information, contact your corporate 
system administrator.
 
3. Press the Menu key and select Activate.
 
 Your BlackBerry attempts to activate itself with your corporation.
 
 Some corporations don’t allow any employee-purchased BlackBerry 
smartphones to be activated with corporate e-mail. Check with your 
system administrator for corporate BlackBerry policies.
Getting e-mail in an enterprise 
environment using Desktop Redirector
If you are a sole proprietor or consultant who works in a corporation that 
runs Exchange or Lotus, and you would like to get enterprise e-mails on your 
BlackBerry, this section is for you.

123
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Normally, to get enterprise e-mail, your BlackBerry would have to be 
configured with the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). This is typical if 
your employer hands you a BlackBerry. However, if you work for a large 
company as a contractor, you probably won’t be getting a BlackBerry from 
the company you work for. When you want to get enterprise e-mail so that 
you don’t fall behind (especially if you don’t work five days a week), you 
need Desktop Redirector.
For you start using Desktop Redirector, you first need to install BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager; see Chapter 15 for details about how to do this. After 
you’ve installed Desktop Manager with Redirector, make sure that Redirector 
starts every time you boot up your PC.
Depending on the corporate security policy, some corporations allow 
Desktop Redirector and some do not. Before you start using Desktop 
Redirector, contact the IT department in the company you work for.
Here are just a few caveats when using the Desktop Redirector:
 
✓ You can get enterprise e-mail as long as your PC is turned on and has an 
Internet connection.
 
✓ When someone sends you an attachment, you can’t retrieve it from your 
BlackBerry.
 
✓ When someone sends you a meeting notice, you can’t accept or reject it.
Customizing Your E-Mail
In the following sections, we go over the details of the following e-mail 
configurations:
 
✓ Configuring an e-mail signature: If you’re tired of writing Regards, John 
Smith over and over to close an e-mail, set an e-mail signature.
 
✓ Enabling wireless e-mail reconciliation: After enabling e-mail recon-
ciliation, whatever you see on your BlackBerry is what you get in your 
e-mail account(s). You no longer have to double-delete a message in 
both your BlackBerry and your e-mail account(s).
 
✓ Configuring autoreplies: Whether you are out of the office or just want 
a quick response message sent to your senders, this is where you can 
specify the message they see. This feature is for enterprise users only.
Configuring your e-mail signature
By default, your e-mail signature is something like “Sent via My BlackBerry,” 
which can be cool in the first week, showing off to people that you are a la 

124
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
mode with your BlackBerry. But sooner or later, you might not want people 
to know that you are out and about while answering e-mail. Or, you might 
want something more personal. Follow these steps to configure your e-mail 
signature by using the Service client:
 
1. Log on to the Service client on your PC.
 
 The BlackBerry Internet Service client appears (refer to Figure 7-1).
 
2. Click the Edit icon for the desired e-mail account.
 
 The edit screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
3. In the Signature field, type the desired text for your e-mail signature.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
If you work in an enterprise environment, you might need to perform these 
steps directly on your BlackBerry. Keep in mind that you can set up an e-mail 
signature on your BlackBerry only if your company is using BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server (BES) 4.0 or later. Check with your BlackBerry system 
administrator to see what version of BES your company uses.
Here’s how to configure your email signature in an enterprise environment:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
 
3. From the Options screen, select Email Settings.
 
 Here you see a list of e-mail setting options.
 
4. Highlight the Use Auto Signature field, press the trackball, and 
select Yes.
 
 Doing so enables your e-mail signature.
 
Figure 7-2: 
The e-mail 
account edit 
screen.
 

125
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
5. In the text box at the bottom of the screen, type your e-mail signature 
(see Figure 7-3).
 
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and selecting Save.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Auto 
Signature 
field.
 
Enabling wireless reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in 
two places (on your computer and on your BlackBerry). The two e-mail 
inboxes reconcile with each other, hence the term wireless reconciliation. 
Convenient, huh?
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your 
BlackBerry. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Messages.
 
 This opens the Messages application. You see the message list.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Options.
 
 The Options screen appears, with two option types: General Options 
and Email Reconciliation.
 
3. Select Email Reconciliation.
 
 This opens the Email Reconciliation screen, which has the following 
options:
 
• Delete On: Configures how BlackBerry handles your e-mail 
deletion.
 
• Wireless Reconciliation: Turns on or off the wireless sync function.
 
• On Conflict: Controls how BlackBerry handles any inconsistencies 
between e-mail on your BlackBerry and the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client.

126
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
 With this option, you can choose who “wins”: your BlackBerry or 
the BlackBerry Internet Service client.
 
4. Select Delete On, and then select one of the following from the 
drop-down list:
 
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on your 
BlackBerry only.
 
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on 
both your BlackBerry and your inbox on the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client.
 
• Prompt: This option prompts your BlackBerry to ask you at the 
time of deletion where the deletion takes effect.
 
5. Select Wireless Reconciliation, and then select On from the 
drop-down list.
 
6. Select On Conflict, and make a selection from the drop-down list.
 
 If you choose Handheld Wins, the e-mail messages in your e-mail 
account will match the ones on the handheld.
 
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the e-mail 
reconciliation feature of the BlackBerry, so you still might have to delete an 
e-mail twice.
Permanently deleting e-mail from your BlackBerry
When deleting e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in that e-mail 
account is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your BlackBerry to 
permanently delete e-mail, but use this option with caution — after that 
e-mail is gone, it’s gone.
To permanently delete e-mail on your Service client from your BlackBerry, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Options.
 
3. On the Options screen, select Email Reconciliation.
 
4. On the Email Reconciliation screen, press the Menu key and select 
Purge Deleted Items.
 
 You see all your e-mail accounts.
 
5. Choose the e-mail account from which you want to purge deleted 
items.
 
 A screen appears, warning you that you are about to purge deleted 
e-mails on your Service client.

127
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
6. Select Yes.
 
 Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
 
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work with the Purge Deleted 
Items feature.
Automating replies and out-of-office 
messages (for enterprise users)
 
Setting an autoreply for your e-mail is easy on the BlackBerry. Whether you 
need to acknowledge incoming e-mail to senders or establish an out-of-office 
reply, you can set it up via this feature:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
 
3. From the Options screen, select Email Settings.
 
 You see a list of e-mail setting options.
 
4. Highlight the Use Out of Office Reply field, press the trackball, and 
select Yes.
 
 Auto Reply is enabled.
 
5. In the text box at the bottom of the screen, type your autoreply 
message.
 
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and then selecting 
Save.
Unfortunately, the BlackBerry Internet Service does not have the “out-of-
office” message feature, but that doesn’t mean you can’t work around it. One 
way to set your out-of-office message is by going to your e-mail service 
account (Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, and so on) and set the out-of-office message 
from there. If you are like us and have more than one e-mail account routed 
to your BlackBerry, you have to do this for each account. It’s not ideal, but 
it works.
Accessing Messages
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also configure 
wireless e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s).

128
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
To access Messages, press the Menu key from the Home screen and select 
Messages. The first thing you see after opening Messages is the message 
list. Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail messages, missed phone 
call notices, Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages, and even saved 
Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about security or speed of delivery, with 
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands when 
receiving e-mail on your BlackBerry.
And whether you’ve aggregated accounts or just use the plain-vanilla 
BlackBerry e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When 
you receive an e-mail message, your BlackBerry notifies you by displaying a 
numeral next to a mail icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This 
number represents how many new (unread) e-mails you have. See Figure 7-4. 
If you see a red asterisk next to the envelope, it is indicating that there is 
new mail and you haven’t opened the Messages application yet.
Your BlackBerry can also notify you of new e-mail by vibration or a sound 
alert or both. You can customize this from the Profile application, as we 
detail in Chapter 3.
 
Figure 7-4: 
You’ve 
got (333) 
e-mails!
 
Retrieving e-mail
Retrieving your e-mail is simple. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Messages.
 
 Doing so allows you to view your message list.
 
2. In the message list, scroll to any e-mail and press the trackball.

129
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
 You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small unopened 
envelope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an 
opened envelope icon, a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon, and a 
document icon represents a draft e-mail.
 
3. After you finish reading the message, press the Escape key to return to 
the message list.
Sorting the message list
The BlackBerry lists items in order by the date and time they were received, 
but you can sort by different criteria. For example, to see only incoming 
e-mail, press Alt+I.
Sorting and searching are closely related on your BlackBerry. In a sense, 
searching is really sorting your e-mail based on your search criteria. On the 
BlackBerry, you can search your e-mail by the name of the sender or by 
keywords. Or you could run a search as broad as looking through all the 
e-mail that has been sent to you. See the later section “Searching through 
Messages like a Pro” for more on searching and sorting. For more predefined 
hot keys, see the upcoming section “Reusing saved searches.”
Saving a message to the saved folder
You can save any important e-mail in a folder so that you can find it without 
sorting through tons of e-mail. To do so, simply scroll to the e-mail you 
want to save, press the Menu key, and select Save from the menu. A pop-up 
message confirms that your e-mail has been saved. Note: Your saved e-mail 
still remains in the message list.
To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select View Saved 
Messages.
 
 You see the list of all the messages you saved.
 
3. Select the message you want and press the trackball to open it.
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry is so versatile that you can view most e-mail attachments 
just like you can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking sizeable attachments, 
too, such as JPEGs (photos), Word docs, PowerPoint slides, and Excel 
spreadsheets. Table 7-1 shows a list of supported attachments viewable from 
your BlackBerry.

To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paper clip 
icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes 
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
 
1. While reading an e-mail, press the Menu key and select Open 
Attachment.
 
 You see a screen that contains the name of the file, a Table of Contents 
option, and a Full Contents option. For MS Word documents, you can 
see different headings in outline form in the Table of Contents option. 
For picture files, such as JPEGs, you can simply go straight to the Full 
Contents option to see the graphic.
 
 For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and Full Contents 
as options. Depending on the file type, use your judgment on when you 
should use the Table of Contents option.
 
2. Scroll to Full Contents, press the Menu key, and select Retrieve.
 
 Your BlackBerry attempts to contact the BlackBerry Internet Service 
client to retrieve your attachment. This retrieves only part of your 
attachment. As you peruse a document, BlackBerry retrieves more as 
you scroll through the attachment.

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Editing attachments
Your BlackBerry comes with Documents To Go, which means that out of the 
box, you can not only view but also edit Word and PowerPoint documents. 
You can even save the documents to your BlackBerry and transfer them later 
to your PC.
As an example, we show you how to edit a Word document that you received 
as an attachment to an e-mail:
 
1. Open the e-mail.
 
2. In the message list, open an e-mail with a Word document attached.
 
 This opens the e-mail for you to read. Notice the little paper clip, 
indicating that it has an attachment.
 
3. Press the Menu key and select Open Attachment.
 
 You’re prompted with a pop-up that asks whether you want to view the 
Word document or edit with Documents To Go.
 
4. Select Edit with Documents To Go.
 
 Here you can view and edit a document.
 
5. Press the Menu key and select Edit Mode.
 
 In Edit mode, you can edit your document.
 
6. When are you finished editing and viewing, you can either save the 
document on your BlackBerry or e-mail it:
 
• To e-mail the edited document, press the Menu key and select Send 
via Email.
 
 Here you will see an e-mail message with the Word document. 
Follow the steps described in the next section to send this 
attachment e-mail as you would any other e-mail.
 
• To save the document, press the Menu key and select Save.
 
 Note that if you want to save the attachment to your BlackBerry, 
you have to navigate the folder structure on the BlackBerry. For 
documents, the default save location is usually in the Document 
folder.
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry is to 
write an e-mail to let your friends know that you’ve just gotten a BlackBerry. 
Follow these steps to send an e-mail message:

132
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Compose Email.
 
 You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you need to fill out, just as 
you would do on your PC.
 
3. In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
 
 As you type, you see a list of contacts from your Contacts that match 
the name or address that you’re typing. You can make a selection from 
this list.
 
4. Enter a subject in the Subject field, and type your message in the 
Body field.
 
5. When you’re finished typing, press the Menu key and select Send.
 
 Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or a friend, you 
can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
 
1. Open the e-mail.
 
 For information on opening e-mail, see the previous section “Retrieving 
e-mail.”
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Forward.
 
3. Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the To field, and then 
add a message if needed.
 
 When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down list of your 
contacts appears and you can choose from it.
 
4. Press the Menu key and select Send.
 
 Your message is on its way to your recipient.
Sending e-mail to more than one person
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding 
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a Cc 
(carbon copy) or Bcc (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:
 
1. Open the e-mail.
 
 For information on opening e-mail, see the previous section “Retrieving 
e-mail.”
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Compose Email.

133
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
3. Specify the To field for the e-mail recipient and then press the 
Return key.
 
 By pressing the Return key, another To field is added automatically 
below the first. The Cc field works the same way.
 
4. To add a Bcc recipient, press the Menu key and select Add Bcc.
 
 You see a Bcc field. You can specify a Bcc recipient the same way you 
do To and Cc recipients.
Whether you are composing a new e-mail, replying, or forwarding an e-mail, 
you add new Cc and Bcc fields the same way.
Saving a draft e-mail
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lost for words to 
express the message they want. Don’t fret, fellow wordsmith, you can save 
that e-mail composition as a draft until your words come back to you. You 
only need to press the Menu key and select Save Draft.
This saves your e-mail as a draft. When you’re ready to send your message, 
choose the draft from the message list. You can tell which messages are 
drafts because they sport a tiny document icon; finished messages have an 
envelope icon.
Attaching a file to your e-mail
Many people are surprised that you can attach any document on your 
BlackBerry or on the microSD card. You can attach Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint documents, as well as pictures, music, and videos. To send an 
e-mail with a file attached, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Compose Email.
 
 You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you can fill out as you would 
on your PC. Enter the recipient’s name in the To field, and then enter the 
subject and body of the message.
 
3. Press the Menu key and select Attach File.
 
 You’re prompted with a pop-up that shows your folders. Think of this 
as the folders on your PC.
 
4. Navigate to the file of your choice and press the trackball.
 
 After you select a file, you see the file in the e-mail message.
 
5. When you’re finished, press the Menu key and select Send.
 
 Your message and attached file wing their way to the recipient.

134
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Spell-checking your outgoing messages
Whether you are composing an e-mail message or an SMS text message 
(see Chapter 8), you can always check your spelling with the built-in spell 
checker. Simply press the Menu key and select Check Spelling. When it finds 
an error, the BlackBerry spell checker makes a suggestion, as shown in 
Figure 7-5. To skip the spell check for that word and go on to the next word, 
press the Escape key. If you want to skip spell checking for an e-mail, simply 
press and hold the Escape key.
Note that if you are used to MS Word underlining a misspelled word, your 
BlackBerry does the same thing.
By default, the spell checker does not kick in before you send your message, 
but you can configure it to check spelling before you send an e-mail. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
 
3. Select the Spell Check option.
 
4. Select the Spell Check Email before Sending check box.
 
5. Press the Menu key and select Save.
 
The underline feature is a default setting called Check Spelling as You Type. 
To turn off this feature, disable the Spell Check option in Message Options.

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Adding a sender to Contacts
You can add a message sender’s contact info to BlackBerry Contacts directly 
from Messages. You don’t even have to copy or write down the person’s 
name and e-mail address.
To add a sender to Contacts, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Messages.
 
2. In the message list, scroll to an e-mail and press the trackball.
 
3. From the open e-mail, scroll to the sender’s name, press the trackball, 
and then choose Add to Contacts.
 
 The New Address screen opens. The sender’s first name, last name, and 
e-mail address are transferred automatically to Contacts.
 
4. If needed, add any additional information (such as phone number and 
mailing address).
 
5. Press the Menu key and select Save.
Deleting e-mail
Keeping your message list tidy can help you stay organized and reduce the 
amount of memory your e-mail takes. Cull those messages you no longer 
need by following these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Messages.
 
2. In the message list, highlight the e-mail you want to delete and then 
press the Delete key.
 
 A deletion confirmation window appears.
 
3. Select Delete to confirm your deletion.
 
 The deleted e-mail is toast.
 
To delete more than one e-mail, press the Cap key and scroll to highlight as 
many e-mails as you want. After you make your deletion selections, press the 
Delete key.
 
You can delete anything listed in the message list (such as an SMS or a voice 
mail) in the same way that you delete an e-mail message.
If you want to really clean up your old e-mails and you don’t want to scroll 
through tons of messages, you can do the following:

136
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. From the message list, highlight a horizontal date mark, press the 
Menu key, and choose Delete Prior.
 
 The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates. Just like you can 
highlight e-mails in the message list, you can also highlight the date 
mark.
 
 A pop-up appears, prompting you for delete confirmation.
 
 Before you take the plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all the 
e-mails before the particular date mark. You cannot retrieve deleted items 
from your BlackBerry.
 
3. Select Delete to confirm your deletion.
 
 All your e-mails prior to the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of us get e-mail that isn’t urgent or doesn’t really concern us. Instead of 
receiving these e-mails on your BlackBerry — and wasting both time and 
effort to check them — you can filter them out. While in the BlackBerry 
Internet Service client, set up filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive 
only those e-mails that you care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive all 
your e-mails on your main computer.)
To create a simple filter that treats work-related messages as urgent and 
forwards them to your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
1. Log on to the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 7-1).
 
2. Click the Filter icon for the desired e-mail account.
 
 The Filter screen that appears shows a list of filters that have been 
created. See Figure 7-6.
 
3. Click the Click Here link.
 
 The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Filter list 
screen.
 

137
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
Figure 7-7: 
Create a 
filter for 
your e-mail 
here.
 
 
4. Enter a name in the Filter Name text box.
 
 The filter name can be anything you like. We entered WorkUrgent.
 
5. In the Apply Filter When drop-down list, choose the condition to place 
on the filter:
 
• A High-Priority Mail Arrives: Select this option if the filter applies 
only to urgent e-mail.
 
• Subject Field Contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled 
(you can type text in it). You can specify what keywords the 
filter will look for in the subject field. Separate each entry with a 
semicolon (;).
 
• From Field Contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled 
(you can type text in it). You can type full addresses or part of an 
address. For example, you can type rob@robkao.com or just kao. 
Separate each entry with a semicolon (;).
 
• To Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains, enter e-mail 
address(es).
 
• CC Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains, enter e-mail 
address(es).
 
 For our example, we select From Field Contains.
 
6. Specify the text in the Contains field.
 
 See the details in the preceding step for what to enter in the Contains 
field. Continuing our example, type in the domain of your work e-mail 
address. For example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.
com, enter XYZCo.com.
 
7. Select one of the following options:

138
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
 Forward Messages to Handheld: Select this radio button, and you can 
then select either or both of the check boxes below it:
 
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mails 
that meets the condition(s) you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 to be sent 
to you. (A header doesn’t contain the body of the e-mail — just 
who sent it, the subject, and the time it was sent.) Choose this 
check box if you get automated alerts, where receiving only the 
subject is sufficient.
 
• Level 1 Notification: Level 1 Notification is another way of saying 
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level 1 e-mail, it is bold in 
Messages.
 
 Do Not Forward Messages to Handheld: Selecting this radio button means 
that any e-mail that meets the conditions you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 are 
not sent to your BlackBerry.
 
8. Confirm your filter by clicking the Add Filter button.
 
 You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your newly created 
filter in the list.
 
If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, just take a best guess 
and then check it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail 
doesn’t get filtered correctly, set the conditions until you get them right.
 
As mentioned previously, in an enterprise environment, you might not have 
access to BlackBerry Internet Service, but that doesn’t mean you can’t per-
form functions such as e-mail filtering. In fact, in an enterprise environment, 
you can conveniently configure e-mail filters directly from your BlackBerry. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
 You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Options.
 
3. Select Email Filters.
 
 You are prompted with the Email Filters screen, which lists current 
e-mail filters. (If you haven’t set up any filters, you see an empty list.)
 
4. From the Email Filters screen, press the Menu key and then select New.
 
 A new e-mail Filter screen opens, as shown in Figure 7-8, from which you 
can specify how you want your e-mails filtered.

139
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
Figure 7-8: 
New Filter 
screen.
 
 
5. Enter an e-mail address in the From and/or Sent To fields.
 
 You can either type the name of the person or make a selection from 
Contacts. To retrieve a contact from Contacts, highlight the From or 
Sent To field, press the Menu key, and select Select Name.
 
 This takes you to Contacts, where you can select your contact:
 
• If you have contacts in Contacts: Highlight the contact you want and 
then press the trackball.
 
• If you don’t have contacts or if the one you want isn’t in Contacts: If 
you know the name of the contact, you can simply type the info in 
the From or Sent To field on the Filter screen.
 
 After you make this selection, press the Menu key and select Continue. 
You return to the Filter screen.
 
6. Continue to fill in the Filter screen by defining more conditions:
 
• Subject: You can type any keyword(s) in the subject line that you 
want to filter by.
 
• Message: You can type any keyword(s) in the message body that 
you want to filter by.
 
• Sent Directly to Me: Select this check box to specify the condition of 
an e-mail sent directly to you.
 
• CC to Me and BCC to Me: Select one or both of these check boxes to 
specify the condition of an e-mail that you are CCed or BCCed on.
 
• Importance: Choose High, Normal, or Low from this drop-down list.
 
• Sensitivity: Choose None, Normal, Personal, Private, or Confidential 
from this drop-down list.
 
• Action: Choose Forward or Do Not Forward from this drop-down list.
 
 If you choose Forward, you have two more check boxes:

140
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
• Level 1 Notification: Level 1 Notification is another way of saying 
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level 1 e-mail, it is bold in 
Messages.
 
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mail 
that meets the condition(s) you set to be sent to you. Choose this 
option if you get automated alerts, and receiving only the subject 
is sufficient.
 
 If you choose Do Not Forward, e-mail messages that meet the 
conditions you set are not forwarded to your BlackBerry.
 
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and selecting Save.
Searching through Messages like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every day — but 
when you do run a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few 
minutes here to familiarize yourself with general searching.
The BlackBerry Messages application provides three ways to search through 
your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a broad search:
 
✓ Search by sender or recipient: Specific. This method assumes that you 
already know the sender or recipient.
 
✓ Search by subject: Specific. This approach assumes that you already 
know the subject.
 
✓ General search: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
 
You can search through anything listed in the messages list. This means that 
you can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.
Searching by sender or recipient
Search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific message 
from a specific person. For example, suppose your brother constantly sends 
you e-mail (which means your message list has many entries from him). 
You’re trying to locate a message he sent you approximately two weeks ago 
regarding a fishing trip location. You’ve scrolled down the message list, 
but you just can’t seem to find that message. Or maybe you want to find a 
message you sent to Sue but can’t lay your hands on it.

141
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
To find a message when you know the sender or recipient, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, highlight a message that you sent to or received 
from that particular person.
 
 The choice you get in the next step depends on whether you highlighted 
a sent message or a received message.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select one of these options:
 
• To search for a message from someone specific: Because that 
certain someone sent you the message, choose Search Sender.
 
• To search for a message to someone specific: Because you sent that 
certain someone the message, choose Search Recipient.
 
 This starts the search. Any results appear on-screen.
Searching by subject
Search by subject when you’re looking for an e-mail titled by a specific 
subject that you already know. As is the case when running a search by 
sender or recipient, first scroll to an e-mail that bears the same subject 
you’re searching for. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, highlight an e-mail titled by the specific subject 
you’re searching for.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select Search Subject.
 
 The search starts, and the results appear on-screen.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword 
searches of your messages. To run a general search, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and then select Search.
 
3. In the Search screen that appears, fill in your search criteria (see 
Figure 7-9).

142
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 7-9: 
The Search 
screen in 
Messages.
 
 
 The search criteria for a general search follow:
 
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to search by.
 
• In: This is related to the Name criterion. Use this drop-down list to 
indicate where the name might appear, such as in the To or Cc 
field. From the drop-down list, your choices are From, To, Cc, Bcc, 
and any address field.
 
• Subject: This is where you type some of or all the keywords that 
appear in the subject.
 
• Message: Here you enter keywords that appear in the message.
 
• Service: If you set up your BlackBerry to receive e-mail from more 
than one e-mail account, you can specify which e-mail account to 
search.
 
• Folder: This is the folder in which you want to perform the search. 
Generally, you should select All Folders.
 
• Show: This drop-down list specifies how the search result will 
appear, namely, whether you want to see only e-mails that you 
sent or e-mails that you received. From the drop-down list, your 
choices are Sent and Received, Received Only, Sent Only, Saved 
Only, Draft Only, and Unopened Only.
 
• Type: This drop-down list specifies the type of message that you’re 
trying to search for: e-mail, SMS, or voice mail. From the drop-
down list, your choices are: All, Email, Email with Attachments, 
PIN, SMS, Phone, and Voice Mail.
 
 From the Search screen shown in Figure 7-9, you can have multiple 
search criteria or just a single one (it’s up to you).
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Search to launch your search.
 
 The search results appear on-screen.

143
 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
 
You can narrow the search results by performing a second search on the 
initial results. For example, you can search by sender and then narrow those 
hits by performing a second search by subject.
You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific 
message from a specific person. To do so, scroll to an e-mail that bears the 
specific sender or recipient. Press the Menu key and select Search Sender or 
Search Recipient. If the e-mail that you highlighted is an incoming e-mail, 
you’ll see Search Sender. If the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself re-searching with the same criteria over and over, you 
might want to save the search and then reuse it. Here’s how:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the previous section for an outgoing e-mail 
search.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 The Save Search screen appears, from which you can name your search 
and assign it a shortcut key. See Figure 7-10.
 
3. In the Title field, enter a name.
 
 The title is the name of your search, which appears on the search 
Results screen.
 
4. Scroll to the Shortcut Key field, press the trackball, and select a letter 
from the drop-down list.
 
 You have ten letters to choose from.
 
5. Confirm your saved search by pressing the Menu key and selecting Save.
 
Figure 7-10:

search and

144
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Reusing saved searches
Right out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with five saved search results. 
Any new saved result will make your search that much more robust.
Follow these steps to see all saved search results:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Search.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select Recall.
 
 The recall screen opens, and you can see the five preloaded search 
shortcuts, as well as any searches you saved, as shown in Figure 7-11.
To reuse one of saved search results, simply select a desired search from the 
list, press the Menu key, and select Search.
 
If you have multiple e-mail accounts set up, you can set up a search shortcut 
so that you only view one specific account when you want to. For example, 
say you have your personal e-mail and your small business e-mail account 
both set up on your BlackBerry. In the Message application, you see e-mails 
from both, which can be overwhelming at times. From the general Search 
screen (refer to Figure 7-9), set the Service drop-down list to the one you want 
and follow the preceding steps to save the search and assign a shortcut key. 
The next time you only want to see a certain account, you can get to it in an 
instant!

 Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has limits, 
too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your Black-
Berry. (The default is 30 days. Phew.) You can choose several options: from 
15 days to forever (well, for as long as your BlackBerry has enough space 
for them).
 
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, a good way to 
make sure that you don’t lose an important message is to save it.
To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Messages application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
 
3. Select General Options.
 
4. Scroll to the Keep Messages option and then press the trackball.
 
5. From the drop-down list that appears, choose the time frame that you 
want and then press the trackball:
 
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to worry about 
your e-mails being automatically deleted. On the downside, 
though, your BlackBerry will eventually run out of memory. At that 
point, you must manually delete some e-mails so that you have 
space to accept new e-mails.
 
 A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your e-mails by 
using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See Chapter 18 for more on 
backing up your BlackBerry on your PC.
 
• Time option: If you choose a time option, any message older than 
that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry the 
next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, the message will 
be deleted only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail 
reconciliation — because these deletions are only on the device.

Your BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail 
messages and phone conversations as the major drivers. Being the 
social creatures that we are, however, we constantly come up with new 
ways to communicate — ever more ways to overcome the distance 
barrier, as it were. You shouldn’t be surprised that the folks at RIM have 
moved beyond e-mail and phoning in their search for other ways to 
communicate. (And we’re not talking semaphore or stringing together two 
tin cups.)
Not that we’re dismissing the power of phones and e-mail. Both are wonder-
ful technologies, but you might find yourself in a situation where other means 
of communication would be more appropriate. For instance, e-mail isn’t the 
tool of choice for instant messaging/chatting — most people would find that 
method slow and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail the best tool to use when you 
want to alert someone.
“What might be a better fit?” you ask. Read this chapter to find out. You 
can familiarize yourself with some less obvious ways you can use your 
BlackBerry to communicate — ways that might serve as the perfect fit for 
a special situation. You get the inside scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and 
text messaging (also known as Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also 
give you tips on how to turn your BlackBerry into a lean (and not so mean) 
instant messaging machine.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
What happens when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging? First and foremost, get 
the acronym out of the way. PIN stands for personal identification number 
(familiar to anyone who’s ever used an ATM) and refers to a system for 
uniquely identifying your device.
 
PIN-to-PIN, then, is another way of saying one BlackBerry to another BlackBerry.
As for the other details, they’re straightforward. PIN-to-PIN messaging is 
based on the technology that underpins two-way pager systems. Unlike send-
ing a standard e-mail, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, the message 
doesn’t venture outside RIM’s infrastructure in search of an e-mail server and 
(eventually) an e-mail inbox. Instead, it stays solidly in the RIM world, where 
it is shunted through the recipient’s network provider until it ends up on the 
recipient’s BlackBerry.
Here’s the neat part. According to RIM, the message isn’t saved anywhere in 
this universe except on the one device that sends the PIN message and the 
other device that receives it. Compare that with an e-mail, which is saved in 
at least four separate locations (the mail client and e-mail servers of both 
sender and recipient), not to mention all the system’s redundancies and 
backups employed by the server. Think of it this way: If you whisper a little 
secret in someone’s ear, only you and that special someone know what was 
said. In a way, PIN-to-PIN messaging is the same thing, with one BlackBerry 
whispering to another BlackBerry. Now, that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially the ones that cover 
corporate lawsuits extensively — you’ll know that there’s no such thing as 
privacy in e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging, in theory at least, is as good as the 
old Cone of Silence. Now, is such privacy really an advantage? You can argue 
both sides of the issue, depending on what you want to use PIN-to-PIN mes-
saging for. Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be 
kept discreet, PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you don’t care 
about privacy issues, though, you still might be impressed by PIN-to-PIN mes-
saging’s zippy nature. (It really is the Ferrari of wireless communication — 
way faster than e-mail.)
 
The Cone of Silence in an enterprise environment has always been a thorny 
issue to companies that have strict regulatory requirements. As expected, RIM 
addressed this issue with a new feature to later operating systems allowing 
BES administrators to flip a flag, forcing the device to forward all PIN-to-PIN 
messages to the BES server. Third-party applications are also available now 
that a company can install on the device to report PIN-to-PIN messages.

 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When trying to call somebody on the telephone, you can’t get far without 
a telephone number. As you might expect, the same principle applies to 
PIN-to-PIN messaging: No PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messaging. In practical terms, 
this means that you need the individual PIN of any BlackBerry device owned 
by whomever you want to send a PIN message to. (You also need to find out 
your own PIN so that you can hand it out to those folks who want to PIN-
message you.) The cautious side of you might be thinking, Why on earth 
would I give my PIN to somebody? This PIN is really not the same as your 
password. In fact, this PIN doesn’t give anybody access to your BlackBerry 
or do anything to compromise security. It’s simply an identification number; 
you treat it the same way as you treat your phone number.
RIM makes getting hold of a PIN easy. In fact, RIM even provides you with 
multiple paths to PIN enlightenment, as the following list makes clear:
 
✓ From the Help screen: You can find the PIN for any device right there 
on its Help screen. On most BlackBerry models, you can call up the Help 
screen by pressing Alt+Num+H. This shortcut to the Help screen is not 
available on BlackBerry Pearl.
 
✓ From the Message screen: RIM also makes it easy for you to send your 
PIN from the Message screen with the help of a keyword. A keyword is a 
neat feature with which you type a preset word, and your BlackBerry 
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device.
A little bit of RIM history
Sometime during the last millennium, Research 
In Motion (RIM) wasn’t even in the phone busi-
ness. Before BlackBerry became all the rage 
with smartphone features, RIM was doing a tidy 
little business with its wireless e-mail. Back 
then, RIM’s primitive wireless e-mail service 
was served by network service providers on a 
radio bandwidth, namely, DataTAC and Mobitex 
networks. These were separate from a typical 
cellphone infrastructure’s bandwidth. RIM 
devices at that time already had PIN-to-PIN 
messaging. This type of messaging is akin to a 
pager, where a message doesn’t live in a mail-
box but is sent directly to the BlackBerry with 
no delay. (No one wants a paging system that 
moves at turtle speed when you can get one 
that moves like a jack rabbit, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s 
initial decision. Of note, most cellphone users in 
New York City were left without service during 
the 9/11 disaster. As you can understand, the 
entire cellphone infrastructure in New York and 
surrounding areas was overwhelmed when 
faced with too many people trying to use the 
bandwidth available. However, one communi-
cation device continued to work during that 
stressful time — RIM’s PIN-to-PIN messaging 
kept the information flow going.

150
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
 Sound wacky? It’s actually easier than it sounds. To see what we mean, 
just compose a new message. (Chapter 7 gives you the basics on the 
whole e-mail message and messaging thing, if you need a refresher.) In 
the subject or body of your message, type mypin and add a space. As 
soon as you type the space, mypin is miraculously transformed into 
your PIN in the format pin:your-pin-number, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
Isn’t that neat?
 
 mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you. mynumber 
and myver give you the phone number and OS version, respectively, of 
your BlackBerry.
 
✓ From the Status screen: You can also find your PIN on the Status screen. 
On most BlackBerry models, you display the Status screen by choosing 
the following links starting from the Home screen: Settings, Options, and 
Status. Use the trackball to highlight and click the link. Figure 8-2 shows 
a typical Status screen. (The PIN is fifth on the list of items shown.)
 
Figure 8-1: 
Type a 
keyword 
(left), add a 
space, and 
the keyword 
gets trans-
lated (right).

Assigning PINs to names
So, you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of 
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now the trick is finding a 

151
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
convenient place to store your PINs so that you can use them. Luckily for 
you, you have an obvious choice: the BlackBerry Contacts. And RIM, in its 
infinite wisdom, makes storing such info a snap, just like the following steps 
show. To add a PIN to someone’s contact info in Contacts, do the following:
 
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight a contact name, press the Menu key, and then select Edit.
 
 The Edit Contact screen for the contact name you selected makes an 
appearance.
 
3. On the Edit Contact screen, scroll down to the PIN field (as shown in 
Figure 8-3).
 
4. Enter the PIN by pressing letters and numbers on the keyboard.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 The edit you made for this contact is now saved.
It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter the 
PIN information you have when you set up your initial contact info (by using 
the New Contact screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t usually the kind 
of info your causal acquaintances carry around with them.
 
If all this talk about New Contact screens and Edit Contact screens doesn’t 
sound familiar, check out Chapter 4, which covers the Contacts application in 
more detail.

Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than sending an e-mail. 
Here’s how:

152
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight a contact name and then press the Menu key.
 
 If a contact has a PIN, you see a menu item titled PIN <contact name>. 
Say, for example, you have a contact named Dante Sarigumba. When you 
highlight Dante Sarigumba in the list and then press the Menu key, the 
menu item PIN Dante Sarigumba appears as an option, as shown in 
Figure 8-4.
 
3. Select PIN <contact name> from the menu.
 
 The ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN of your buddy 
already entered as an address, makes an appearance.
 
4. Treat the other e-mail-creation stuff — adding a subject line, entering 
the body of your message, and then signing off — just as you would 
with a normal e-mail.
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can also type it directly. Here’s how:
 
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
 
 
 The Messages application opens.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Compose PIN.
 
 The ever-familiar New Message screen makes an appearance.
 
3. In the To field, enter the PIN and then press the trackball.
 
 You just added a recipient in the To field.
 
4. Add a subject line, enter the body of your message, and sign off just 
like you would in a normal e-mail.
 
Figure 8-4:

153
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
 
Unlike e-mails, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, you can tell if the 
recipient got your message almost instantly. Viewing the Message list, you 
see a letter D, which means delivered, on top of the check mark next to the 
PIN-to-PIN message you sent.
 
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a paper 
trail, as it were), RIM has set it up so that companies can disable PIN-to-PIN 
messaging on your BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal problems 
down the road — can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?) If your BlackBerry is from your 
employer and you don’t see the PIN menu item allowing you to send PIN-to-PIN 
messages, you can safely assume that your employer has disabled it. Contact 
your BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) administrator to make sure. (See 
Chapter 1 for an explanation of BES.)
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than receiving a standard 
e-mail. You get the same entry into your Messages list for the PIN-to-PIN 
message that you receive, and the same message screen appears when you 
open the message. By default, your BlackBerry vibrates to alert you, but this 
behavior can be customized in Profiles. In Profiles, PIN-to-PIN is a Level1 
Message. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details on changing your profile.) 
When you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well — 
that is, as long as your BlackBerry is set up to send PIN-to-PIN messages. 
Again, because this involves a BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry communication, you 
won’t see a PIN message show up on your desktop’s e-mail client’s inbox.
Keeping in Touch, the SMS/MMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS, or simply text messaging) is so 
popular these days that you see it used in many TV shows, including the 
Fox Network’s American Idol, which lets you vote for the show’s contestants 
by using SMS. Moreover, SMS is an established technology (not a new and 
unproven thing, in other words) that has been popular for years in Europe 
and Asia, where the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is the 
technology of choice among cellphone network providers. How short is 
short? The maximum size per message is about 160 characters. If you send 
more than that, it gets broken down into multiple messages.
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is the latest evolution of SMS. Rather 
than a simple text message, you can also send someone an audio or a 
video clip.

154
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
Whether you call it SMS, Short Messaging Service, or just plain text messaging, 
your BlackBerry makes it simple. But before we go over the details, we want 
to point out to all you BlackBerry Pearl owners that text messaging does 
pose a challenge for beginners. It’s not that it’s a difficult task; it’s just that 
it’s cumbersome to type the letters by using the limited keypad.
Also, you need to be aware of the trends and options for text messaging. 
There is a growing SMS subculture among teenagers and those who jumped 
onto the bandwagon early. These in-the-know folks use abbreviations 
that might be difficult for you to understand in the beginning, so don’t dive 
in without your oxygen tank. A quick preparation goes a long way toward 
avoiding being labeled uncool when it comes to your SMS syntax. The 
upcoming sections help smooth your path a bit by filling you in on the 
basics of SMS-speak.
Using shorthand for speedy replies
From the get-go, text messaging sprang up from the wild and crazy world 
of cellphone users. And those of you who’ve used a phone lately probably 
know that phone design revolves around entering phone numbers rather 
than entering the text to War and Peace. Time for a reality check: On a 
regular cellphone, three letters share a single key. As you can imagine, trying 
to bang out even a single paragraph can be a real pain.
SMS is a smash!
In the early days of SMS, phone providers gave 
away their text messaging services for free. It 
caught on like wildfire, especially in developing 
countries where folks are a tad more cost 
conscious. In those countries, it didn’t take 
long before lots of folks started carrying a cell-
phone just to avail themselves of the free text 
messaging. Adding to the appeal was the fact 
that many network service providers didn’t even 
force you to pay for a plan; you could walk into 
any convenience store and buy a prepaid SIM 
card, no questions asked. By the way, 
Subscriber Identification Module, or SIM, is a 
tiny electronic chip found in the back of a GSM 
phone. This chip is your gateway to using the 
phone network.
In the United States, however, it took some time 
for SMS to catch up. For one thing, network 
service providers in the United States are 
divided between CDMA and GSM/GPRS tech-
nology. (See Chapter 1 for more on that divide.) 
GSM/GPRS phones have allowed SMS since 
1991; CDMA phones did not until about 2000. 
(Competing innovations do have a downside, 
right?) The second reason was that most 
American homes were wired for regular phone 
service, so cellphones were not necessarily 
seen as something you just had to have. 
However, the convenience of using cellphones 
and SMS are making them more and more 
attractive.

155
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
Human ingenuity prevails. People have found ways to circumvent the fact 
that cellphones have such a limited number of keys at their disposal. One 
strategy that we highlight here involves using abbreviations that allow you to 
cut down on the amount of text you need to enter. These shorthand words 
have quickly become quite hip, especially among the 14–18-year-old set. 
Veteran text messagers (the hip ones, at least) can easily spot people who 
are new to SMS technology by how they don’t use the right lingo — or use 
such lingo incorrectly.
 
Proud owners of a BlackBerry Pearl Flip who are beginners to SMS might 
be tempted to rely on BlackBerry’s default SureType feature when text 
messaging. SureType is a technology used initially in BlackBerry 7100 series 
and is carried on in the BlackBerry Pearl and Pearl Flip. SureType’s purpose is 
to compensate for the limited keys at your disposal on this type of BlackBerry. 
The software is smart enough to predict what you want to type. It can also 
learn and become smarter as you use it. The technology is neat, making it 
possible for you to type words faster and more easily on the BlackBerry Pearl. 
However, you might find yourself in a situation in which you receive text 
from buddies who use cool, with-it, hip, shorthand lingo, and you respond 
with white-bread, uncool, complete words provided for you by SureType 
technology. To preserve (or create) your cool image, we recommend disabling 
SureType when you do any text messaging. (Chapter 2 fills you in on how to 
toggle SureType on and off.) That way, you can master shorthand without any 
interference from SureType and transform yourself into a text-messaging fool.
Awhfy?
In text messaging, the challenge lies in using abbreviations to craft a sentence 
with as few letters as possible. Because text messaging has been around for a 
number of years, plenty of folks have risen to this challenge by coming up 
with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. Don’t feel that you have to 
rush out and memorize the whole shorthand dictionary at once, though. As 
with mastering a new language, start out with the most commonly used 
words or sentences. Then when you become familiar with those, slowly 
gather in more and more terms. In time, the whole shorthand thing will be 
second nature.
And what are the most commonly used terms? Funny you should ask. Table 
8-1 gives you our take on the most common abbreviations, which are enough 
to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least follow the 
most important parts of an SMS conversation. Feel free to check out the Web 
site associated with this book (www.blackberryfordummies.com) for a 
more comprehensive list of shorthand abbreviations.

Showing some emotion
One aspect of written communication that has gotten a few folks in trouble 
now and then is that the very same words can mean different things to 

157
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
different people. A simple example is the phrase, “You’re such a clueless 
individual.” When you speak such a phrase (with the appropriate facial and 
hand gestures), your conversational partner knows right off the bat (we 
hope) that you’re teasing and that it’s all a bit of fun. Write that same phrase 
in a text message and, well, you might get a nasty reply in return — which 
you then have to respond to, which prompts another response, and soon 
enough you’ve just ended that seven-year friendship.
Because SMS is meant for quick and short messages akin to chatting — 
rather than long and drawn-out debates about what you actually meant when 
you said what you said — a quick-and-dirty system for characterizing what 
you’ve just written (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) has sprung up. Known 
as emoticons, these cutesy typographical devices let you telegraph your 
meaning in sledgehammer-to-the-forehead fashion.
Yes, we’re talking smileys here — those combinations of keyboard characters 
that when artfully combined, resemble a human face. The most popular 
example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially 
chirpy individuals — is the happy face, which you see used (usually at the 
end of a statement) to convey good intentions or imply a happy context, 
like this :).
Table 8-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. The trick to recognizing 
what each smiley conveys lies in your ability to view them sideways (hope-
fully without developing a crick in your neck). Just remember that smileys 
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure 
that your “gently teasing remark” isn’t misconstrued as a hateful comment.

Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff as well as the smileys under your belt, 
get your fingers pumped up and ready for action: It’s message-sending time! 
Whether its SMS or a richer audio/video (MMS) message, here’s how it’s 
done:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens.
 
2. Highlight a contact who has a cellphone number, press the Menu key, 
and select SMS (or MMS) <contact name> from the menu that appears.
 
 The menu item for SMS or MMS is intelligent enough to display the name 
of the contact. For example, if you choose John Doe, the menu item 
reads SMS John Doe or MMS John Doe, as shown in Figure 8-5. (Note 
the space for entering your text message, right underneath the screen 
heading.)
 
3. If you chose MMS, browse from your multimedia folders and select the 
audio or video file you want to send.
 
 When choosing MMS, this extra step allows you to choose the multi-
media file. This is the only difference between SMS and MMS with regard 
to sending a message.
 
4. Type your message.
 
 Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage 
of it the first chance you get. (Practice makes perfect.)

5. Press the trackball and then select Send from the menu that appears.
 
 Your message is sent on its merry way.
Viewing a message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get a notification just 
like you do when you receive an e-mail. Also, like e-mail, the e-mail icon at 
the top of the Home screen indicates a new message. In fact, everything 
about viewing SMS and MMS messages is pretty much the same as reading 
an e-mail. So, if you have Chapter 7 loaded into your memory, you know how 
to read SMS messages. The basic run-through is as follows:
 
1. Open Messages.
 
2. Scroll to the unread message.
 
3. Press the trackball.
 
4. Bob’s your uncle: The message appears on-screen.
 
You can customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you receive an 
SMS message. Chapter 3 has the scoop on all the customization options for 
your BlackBerry, including options for SMS notification. (Look for the section 
about customizing your profile.)
Always Online Using Instant Messaging
Real-time conversation with your friends or buddies over the Internet is 
easier with the advent of Instant Messenger. This technology allows two or 
more people to send and receive messages quickly with the use of software 
that uses the Internet as the wire. It all started with pure text messages and 
evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even video conversation in 
real time.

160
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
You may not find Instant Messenger in your BlackBerry. That’s because it’s a 
service provider’s prerogative to include IM on the BlackBerry it sells. (Most 
providers, however, do support it for the BlackBerry Pearl Flip.) Also, your 
company has the option of not including Instant Messenger. Here’s the deal: 
You can add Instant Messenger to your BlackBerry even if it didn’t come as a 
default. Now, for those who already have Instant Messenger installed, you’re 
in luck. You can go on your merry IM way. However, for those of you lacking 
an IM application, don’t despair. See the upcoming section, “Instant messaging 
on your BlackBerry,” which shows you where to download Instant Messenger 
so you can install it on your BlackBerry.
Chatting using IM rules
When America Online (AOL) came out with Instant Messenger (IM) in the 
mid-1990s, it was an overnight hit. What made it successful was that it could 
Messaging etiquette and a few words of caution
Here are some commonsense messaging rules 
as well as a few words of caution. Even if you’re 
new to messaging, being a neophyte doesn’t 
give you free license to act like a jerk. So 
remember, play nice and take the following 
pointers to heart:
 ✓ Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings. 
Read more about emoticons and smileys 
earlier in this chapter.
 ✓ Do not ever forward chain letters. We mean 
it. Never.
 ✓ If you need to forward a message, check 
the entire message content first. Make sure 
that nothing offends the recipient.
 ✓ Some things in this world need to be said 
face to face, so don’t even think of using 
messaging for it. Ever try dumping your 
girlfriend or boyfriend over the phone? 
Guess what? Using messaging is a far 
worse idea.
 ✓ Keep your tone gender neutral. Some mes-
sages that are forwarded through e-mails 
are inappropriate to the opposite sex.
 ✓ Capital letters are like shouting, so DON’T 
USE THEM.
 ✓ Know your recipient. A newbie may not 
easily grasp smileys and shorthand at first, 
so act accordingly. (Read more about short-
hand earlier in this chapter.)
 ✓ Don’t reply to any message when you’re 
angry. You can’t unsend a sent message. 
It’s better to be prudent than sorry.
 ✓ Don’t spread gossip or make personal 
remarks about other people. Beware! Your 
messages can end up in the wrong hands 
and haunt you in the future.
 ✓ Easy does it. There is no documented evi-
dence of the deleterious effects (physical 
or psychological) of too much text messag-

recorded case of Instantmessagingitis. As 
your great-grandma would tell you, too 
much of anything is bad for you. It’s easy to 
lose track of time doing IM.

provide quick (instantaneous) responses to any messages you sent. In addi-
tion, the service introduced many simple (yet clever) functions that offer you 
a new way of communicating. For example, you can chat with multiple people 
at the same time. You can tell whether someone is trying to type a message 
to you. You can even tell whether your buddies are online, away from their 
computers, or simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment. IM adds 
up to a totally different slant on long-distance communication, opening a 
wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good (team 
collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you might expect, IM is great for both personal and business applications. 
Whether you’re maintaining friendships or busily working to create new 
ones, Instant Messenger is definitely one powerful tool to consider adding to 
your social-skills toolbox.
Instant messaging on your BlackBerry
Most network providers dish out the three most popular IM services to their 
BlackBerry customers:
 
✓ Google Talk
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger
 
✓ Windows Live Messenger (from the giant Microsoft)
Those three IM programs aren’t the only popular ones. Here are several more:
 
✓ AOL Instant Messenger
 
✓ ICQ Instant Messenger
 
✓ iChat AV (on the Macintosh)
 
✓ Jabber (open source, also known as free)
If you’re using an IM network that isn’t preloaded, you can always check 
RIM’s Web site to download the applications: www.mobile.blackberry.
com. On this page, go to IM and Social Networking. The list of IM applications 
should be listed on the next page with a link for download.
IM basics: What you need
Assuming that you have the IM application available in your BlackBerry, you 
just need two things to start using the standard four IM programs:
 
✓ User ID
 
✓ Password

162
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Getting a user ID/password combo is a breeze. Just go to the appropriate 
registration Web page (listed next) for the IM application(s) you want to use. 
Use your desktop or laptop machine for signing up. It’s easier and faster 
that way.
 
✓ Google Talk: www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?
service=talk
 
✓ AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): https://reg.my.screenname.aol.
com/_cqr/registration/initRegistration.psp
 
✓ ICQ: www.icq.com/register
 
✓ MSN Live Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com/download/
getstarted.aspx
 
✓ Y! Messenger: http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.
src=pg&.done=http://messenger.yahoo.com
 
Given the many IM network choices available, your friends are probably 
signed up on a bunch of different networks. You may end up having to sign up 
for multiple networks if you want to reach them all by using IM.
Going online with IM
After you obtain the user ID/password combo for one (or more) of the IM 
services, you can use your BlackBerry to start chatting with your buddies by 
following these steps:
 
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the IM application of your 
choice.
 
 To illustrate how to do this, we are using Google Talk. An application-
specific logon screen shows up for you to sign on, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 8-6. It’s straightforward, with the standard screen name 
or ID line and password line.
 
2. Enter your screen name/ID and password.
 
Figure 8-6:

Google Talk.

 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
 
3. (Optional) If you want, select the Remember Password check box. 
Also if you want, select the Automatically Sign Me In check box.
 
 When the Remember Password check box is enabled, it allows you to 
keep the ID/password information preentered the next time you come 
back to this screen. (Um, that is, you don’t have to type this stuff every 
time you want to IM.) We recommend that you select this check box 
to save time but also set your handheld password to enabled so that 
security is not compromised. Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher 
on how to enable passwords on your BlackBerry.
 
 The Automatically Sign Me In check box allows you to toggle the feature 
of signing in automatically when your BlackBerry is powered up. This is 
helpful if you have a habit of turning off your BlackBerry periodically.
 
4. Press the trackball and then select Sign In.
 
 At this point, IM tries to log you on. This can take a few seconds, during 
which time the screen reads Sending request to AOL or Sending 
request to Yahoo! or Sending request to ICQ while it’s in 
this phase. After you’re logged on, a simple listing of your contacts, or 
buddies, appears on the screen.
 
5. Select the person you’d like to chat with.
 
 A menu appears, listing various things you can do. Features could differ 
a little bit for each IM application, but for Google Talk, here’s a sample of 
what you can do:
 
• Start Chat
 
• Send File
 
• Add a Friend
 
• Rename
 
• Remove
 
• Block
 
6. Select the action you’d like.
Adding a contact/buddy
Before you can start chatting with your buddies, you need to know their user 
IDs as well:
 
Provider 
Where You Get Someone’s User ID
 
AIM 
Your friend or by searching AOL’s directory
 
Google Talk 
The text before the @ sign in his or her Google 
 
 
e-mail address
 
Yahoo! 
The text before the @ sign in his or her Yahoo! 
 
 
e-mail address
 
ICQ 
Your friend’s e-mail or the ICQ Global Directory
 
MSN 
MSN passport ID or Hotmail ID

164
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time you want 
to IM someone. You can store IDs as part of a contact list. Follow these steps:
 
1. Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the Menu key.
 
2. Select Add a Friend, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
 The Add a Friend screen appears.
 
3. Enter the user ID of your contact on the Add a Friend screen.
 
4. Press the trackball.
 
 IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact is a valid user ID. 
If the ID is valid, the application adds the ID to your list of contacts. The 
buddy goes either to the Online or Offline section of your list, depending 
on whether your buddy is logged on. You’ll be warned if the ID you 
entered is not valid.

Talk menu.
 
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe 
assumption on our part, we think). By sending a message within the IM 
application, you’re initiating a conversation. Here are the details on how to 
do it:
 
1. Log on to the IM application of your choice.
 
2. Select the person you want to contact.
 
 A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion lists old mes-
sages sent to and received from this contact. You type your message at 
the bottom part of the screen.
 
3. Type your message.

165
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
 
4. Press the Enter key.
 
 Your user ID and the message you just sent show up in the topmost 
(history) section of the chat screen. When you get a message, it’s 
added to the history section so that both sides of your conversation 
stay in view.
Sending your smile
You can quickly add emoticons to your message (without having to 
remember all the character equivalents in Table 8-1). Follow these steps:
 
1. While you’re typing your message, press the Menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
2. Select Show Symbols.
 
 All the icons appear, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
3. Select the emoticon you want.
 
 The emoticon is added to your message.

You can 
choose from 
many 
smileys.
 
Using BlackBerry Messenger
RIM has entered the IM horse race in the form of a spirited filly named — 
you guessed it — BlackBerry Messenger. This application is based on the 
PIN-to-PIN messaging technology described earlier in this chapter, which 
means that it is mucho fast and quite reliable.
 
However, with BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies 
who have a BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The 
application supports IM features common to many of the other applications, 
such as group chatting and the capability to monitor the availability of other 
IM buddies.

166
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Running BlackBerry Messenger
You can access BlackBerry Messenger in the Applications folder from the 
Home screen, as shown on the left in Figure 8-9. The first time you run 
BlackBerry Messenger, it asks for two things:
 
✓ Your display name (as shown on the right in Figure 8-9)
 
✓ A password (in case you need to restore your contact list in the future)
You see a contact list the next time you open the application, as shown on 
the left in Figure 8-10. (Okay, we know it looks empty here, but we show you 
how to populate it in a minute.)
Pressing the Menu key lets you do these things, as shown on the right side of 
Figure 8-10:
 
✓ Customize the groupings
 
✓ Add a contact
 
✓ Set your availability
 
✓ Start a conversation
 
✓ Change your options

 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
Adding a contact
With nobody in your contact list, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty useless 
item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone 
you know who 
 
✓ Has a BlackBerry
 
✓ Is entered in your Contacts
 
✓ Has PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled
 
✓ Has a copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on his or her device
If you know someone who fits these criteria, you can add that person to your 
list by doing the following:
 
1. In BlackBerry Messenger, press the Menu key.
 
2. Select Add a Contact.
 
 All the contacts in your BlackBerry Contacts show up on-screen.
 
3. Select the name you want to add to your BlackBerry Messenger 
contact list.
 
 A Message dialog box displays the Permission Request message. 
BlackBerry sends the request to the potential contact, as shown in 
Figure 8-11. You can edit the message that’s sent.
 
4. Type your message.
 
5. Select OK, and then select OK again in the screen that follows.
 
 The application sends your request. As long as the person has not 
responded to your request, his or her name appears as part of the 
Pending Contacts group, as shown in Figure 8-12. When your contact 
responds positively to your request, that name goes to the official 
contact list.

Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Messenger main menu, select the name in your 
contact list.
 
 A traditional chat interface opens, with a list of old messages at the top 
and a text box for typing messages at the bottom.
 
2. Type your message.
 
3. Press the Enter key.
 
 Any messages you send (as well as any responses you get) are appended 
to the history list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
You can easily invite others to your BlackBerry Messenger conversation. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. During a conversation, press the Menu key.
 
 The BlackBerry Messenger main menu appears. This time, an Invite 
option has been added.
 
2. Select Invite.
 
 The Select a Contact screen opens.
 
3. Select people, one at a time.
 
 You can choose any number of people.
 
4. Select OK.
 
 You’re back to the previous conversation screen, but this time, the 
history list shows the contacts you added to the conversation. The 
newly selected contact can now join the conversation.

169
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
 
You can make your name appear snazzy by adding symbols:
 
1. On the BlackBerry Messenger screen, press the Menu key.
 
2. Select Edit My Info.
 
3. Press the Sym key to choose the symbol you want.
 
 You can quickly page down on the symbol screen by pressing the 
Sym key.
 
Figure 8-13:

bols to your 
name here.
 
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts all at 
the same time — your BlackBerry’s physical limitations may cramp your IM 
style. No matter whether you use AIM, Y! Messenger, ICQ, MSN Messenger, or 
BlackBerry Messenger, it’s still slower to type words on the tiny keypad than 
it is to type on your PC.
Do you just give up on the dream of IMing on the go? Not necessarily. The fol-
lowing sections show how you can power up your BlackBerry IM technique.
Less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your 
exposure. Take a whack at your contact list so that only your true buddies 
remain as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming 
your list is easy — to delete a contact from your IM application, use the 
Delete option from your BlackBerry Messenger main menu.
 
Deleting a contact or buddy from an IM application on your BlackBerry also 
deletes it from the desktop or laptop computer version of the app. That’s 
because the list of contacts is maintained at a central location — an IM server, 
to be precise — and not on your BlackBerry.

170
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
A simple work-around here is to set up two accounts of your favorite IM 
application — one for your BlackBerry and one for your desktop. By using 
these accounts separately, you can limit the number of contacts you have 
on your BlackBerry and still maintain a full-blown list of contacts on your 
desktop.
Lesser typing — use shorthand
Cut down your typing time. Don’t forget the shorthand described previously. 
It’s widely used in IM as well as texting, so refer to Table 8-1 whenever you 
can so that you can quickly respond. Before you know it, you’ll have the 
abbreviations memorized and be using them with ease. The emoticons also 
can make your conversation more interesting. Always take them out of your 
toolbox. Refer to Table 8-2 for the list of the most common ones.
Jive on
If you want to make sure that you won’t have 
text-messaging fees for using an IM client, 
check out these IM programs:
 ✓ BeejiveIM (www.beejive.com/
download/blackberry.htm): This 
one-time-fee program connects directly to 
the Web instead of using SMS. It works with 
multiple IM networks and multiple accounts 
per network: AIM, Microsoft Live 
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Google 
Talk, ICQ, Jabber, and MySpace IM. This is 
one of the best options.
 ✓ Nimbuzz (www.nimbuzz.com): Nimbuzz 
supports many of the popular IM networks. 
It even supports calls using the Skype net-
work. And the best thing is that it’s free and 
does not use SMS.
 ✓ IM+ (www.shapeservices.com/
eng/im/blackberry): If you don’t 
want to pay annually, consider this service. 
IM+ only asks for a one-time fee and also 
supports Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, ICQ, Google 
Talk, and Jabber networks. The best thing 
about IM+ is that it sends messages by 
using the Internet rather than SMS, which 
is best suited for people who have the 
unlimited data plan. You have to choose a 
version: The Regular version connects to 
BES. (See Chapter 1 for details on BES.) 
BES is used by companies as a way of con-
necting the BlackBerry platform to a corpo-
rate network and e-mail server. The WAP 
version allows a personal BlackBerry to 
use the network provider’s WAP gateway 
to connect to the Internet. The Shape 
Services Web site has a comprehensive 
FAQ (frequently asked questions) list for 
details about the software.
Check out the Web site associated with this 
book (www.blackberryfordummies.
com) for updates regarding these (and other) 
recommendations.

171
 Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail
SMS versus connecting via the Web
 
SMS messages are short messages designed for cellphones. IM is a step up, 
evolving from the Internet where bandwidth is no longer a concern. It 
provides a better real-time conversation experience across distances. These 
two technologies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes 
apparent that this technology has a place in handheld devices, where 
mobility is an advantage. Some of the IM programs developed and used 
in the BlackBerry in the past use SMS behind the scenes. And because your 
BlackBerry can connect to the Internet, other programs use the Internet 
directly. These differences can affect your monthly bill as well as your 
messaging experience. Read on.
 
If you don’t have unlimited SMS but have an unlimited data plan, be careful with 
any third-party IM software. Make sure that it is using the Internet instead of 
SMS. If it is using an SMS, you’ll incur charges for every message sent and 
received. As of this writing, most network providers charge 20 cents for every 
SMS message. If you’re a heavy IM user, 20 cents adds up quickly and will be a 
nasty surprise on your monthly bill.

I
t’s hard to believe that just over 13 years ago, more folks did not have 
access to the Internet than did. Today, you can surf the Web anytime, 
anywhere, and you can do it by using a traditional desktop or laptop com-
puter, or even a tiny mobile device such as a PDA or a smartphone. Having 
said that, it should be no surprise that your BlackBerry has a Web browser 
of its own.
In this chapter, we explore ways to use BlackBerry Browser effectively. 
We offer shortcuts that improve your experience browsing the Web. We 
also throw in timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to customize your 
browser to make pages load faster and a complete neat-freak’s guide to 
managing your bookmarks.
Your network service provider might also have its own custom browser for 
you to use. We compare these proprietary browsers with the default 
BlackBerry browser so that you can decide which best suits your needs.
Getting Started with BlackBerry Browser
BlackBerry’s Browser comes loaded on your smartphone and accesses 
the Web by a cellphone connection. When you run your BlackBerry on 
BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), the application is called BlackBerry 
Browser; otherwise, it’s called Internet Browser. We just use Browser to make 
things easier.

174
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
The BlackBerry Browser has four variants:
 
✓ One that’s connected to your BES server.
 
✓ One that goes directly to your service provider’s network. This might be 
called by the network service provider’s brand name.
 
✓ A browser that uses the WiFi connection.
 
✓ A WAP browser. Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, was popular in 
the 90s when mobile device displays were very limited and could only 
display five to six rows of text. This technology lost its appeal with the 
advent of high-resolution screens.
If you are a corporate BlackBerry user, your company administrator might 
turn off or not install the other browsers except for the one that connects 
through the company’s BES.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet 
wet, we promise that you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
Accessing Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your device, with its Globe icon 
visible right on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. In most cases, you 
open Browser by scrolling to this icon and then pressing the trackball.
If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from any application 
that distinguishes a Web address. For example, from Contacts, you can open 
Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail that 
contains a Web address, just scroll to that link. The link is highlighted, and 
you can open the page by pressing the trackball.
 
When you access Browser from another application, you don’t have to close 
that application to jump to Browser. Just press the Alt key (to the left of the Z 
key) and the Escape key (to the right of the trackball) at the same time to 
open a pop-up screen with application icons. Use your trackball to highlight 
the Browser icon and then press the trackball to launch Browser.
By default, accessing Browser by clicking a Web address within another 
application opens the Web page associated with that address. (In 
Figure 9-2, we’re opening Browser from the Messages application.) 
Opening Browser by clicking its icon on the Home screen gives you a 
list of bookmarks.

175
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
If you haven’t yet added bookmarks, the opening Browser screen looks like 
Figure 9-3. You can find out more about adding bookmarks later in this 
chapter.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Hitting the (air) waves
After you locate Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
 
1. Open Browser.
 
 Unless the configuration is changed, BlackBerry displays your book-
marks when you open Browser. If you don’t yet have any bookmarks or 
if you want to go to a page that isn’t in your bookmarks, skip to Step 3.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Go To.
 
3. Alternatively, in the screen that appears, enter a Web address, as 
shown in Figure 9-4.
 
4. Select OK.
 
 The Web page appears. While the page is loading, progress is indicated 
at the bottom of the screen.
 
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can 
scroll to that information to highlight it. When the information is highlighted, 
pressing the trackball initiates a phone call or opens a new e-mail message 
(depending on which type of link you highlighted).
 
Figure 9-4: 
Opening a 
Web page is 
simple.
 
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate to a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks are 
highlighted on-screen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, scroll to the 
highlighted link and press the trackball.
 
Here are a few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:

177
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
✓ Quickly move up and down one full display page at a time by pressing 9 
(down arrow) or 3 (up arrow).
 
✓ Quickly switch between full-screen mode and normal mode by pressing 
the exclamation point (!) key. Think of full-screen mode simply as 
another way to view the same Web page on your BlackBerry, but the 
BlackBerry doesn’t show anything extra (for example, signals level) on 
the top portion of the display screen. Normal mode is what you get by 
default.
 
✓ To stop loading a page, press the Escape key.
 
✓ After a page fully loads, go back to the previous page by pressing the 
Escape key.
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the Menu key). It has some useful 
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 9-5.
Here are the Browser menu options:
 
✓ Page View: Appears only if you are currently in Column view. This view 
allows you to see the page as you would normally see it on your PC’s 
Internet browser. The compressed version of the Web page takes up the 
entire screen first. A menu option allows you to zoom in and out.
 
✓ Column View: This is the default view and normally does not appear as 
a menu option. It shows up only if you are currently in Page view. With 
this view, the Web page is displayed vertically, meaning that a wide Web 
page wraps down and you can use the trackball to scroll up and down 
the page.
 
✓ Find: Locates and highlights text within the current page. Like any other 
basic Find tool, choosing this option displays a prompt to enter the text 
you want to find. After the initial search, a Find Next menu appears for 
finding the next matching text.
 
✓ Select: Shows up only if the trackball pointer is placed on text. This 
feature allows you to highlight text on the screen for copying.
 
✓ Stop: Shows up only if you’re in the middle of requesting a page and 
allows you to cancel such request. This is the same as pressing the 
Escape key.
 
✓ Copy: This menu item appears if you have currently highlighted text. 
Selecting Copy copies the highlighted text into memory so that you can 
use it later for pasting somewhere else, such as in MemoPad.
 
✓ Full Image: This menu item appears only if you highlight an image and 
only a portion of the image is displayed on the screen.
 
✓ Save Image: Also appears if you highlight an image and allows you to 
save the image in the built-in memory or SD card.

178
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 9-5: 
The 
Browser 
menu has 
lots of good 
stuff.
 
 
✓ Home: The shortcut to your home page. The default home page can vary 
from carrier to carrier, but to change it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Browser menu.
 
2. Select Options➪Browser Configuration.
 
3. Change the Home Page Address field.
 
✓ Get Link: This menu item appears if you have a currently highlighted 
link. Choosing this menu item opens that page of the link. Hint: The 
faster way to open a link is to press Enter.
 
✓ Go To: Allows you to open a Web page by entering the Web address and 
pressing the trackball. As you enter more addresses, the ones you 
entered before are listed in the History portion of the screen and stored 
for possible future use so that you don’t have to type them again. To 
find out how to clear that list, see the “Cache operations” section, later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ Back <Esc>: Goes back to the previous page you viewed. This menu item 
displays only if you navigated to more than one Web page.
 
 When you see <Esc>, you can achieve the same function by pressing 
the Escape key.
 
✓ Forward: If you’ve gone back at least one Web page in your browsing 
travels, use Forward to progress one page at a time.
 
✓ Recent Pages: Browser can track up to 20 pages of Web addresses 
you’ve visited, which you can view on the History screen. From there, 
you can jump to any of those Web pages by highlighting the history page 
and pressing the Enter key twice.
 
✓ History: Displays a list of the Web pages you visited and allows you to 
jump back quickly to those pages. It is grouped by date.
 
✓ Refresh: Updates the current page. This is helpful when you’re viewing a 
page with data that changes frequently (such as stock quotes).

179
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
✓ Set Encoding: Specifies the encoding used in viewing a Web page. 
This is useful when viewing foreign languages that use different 
characters. Most BlackBerry users don’t have to deal with this and 
probably don’t know what type of encoding a particular language 
could display.
When you try to open a Web page, indicators appear at the bottom of the 
screen that tell you the progress of your request. The left screen in Figure 9-6 
shows that Browser is requesting a page. The right screen of Figure 9-6 shows 
that you’ve reached the page and that the page is still loading.
 
Several icons are in the upper-right corner of both screens in Figure 9-6. We 
explain them, from right to left:
 
✓ The rightmost arrow icon appears when Browser is processing or 
receiving data.
 
✓ The bars to the left of the rightmost arrows show the strength of the 
network signals (the same signal indicator for phone and e-mail).
 
✓ Your connection type also appears. In Figure 9-6, 3g means that the 
connection is a third-generation network. (Chapter 1 gives you the 
scoop on connection types.)
 
✓ The lock icon indicates whether you’re at a secure Web page. Figure 9-6 
is showing a nonsecure page. Whether a page is secure depends 
on the Web site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing your bank, you 
most likely see the secured icon (a closed lock). On the other hand, 
most pages don’t need to be secure, so you see the unsecured icon 
(an open lock).
 
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere 
else, press the Escape key to stop the page from loading.

Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately, you can 
return to a page without typing the same address. While you’re viewing a 
Web page, simply use the Browser menu (shown in Figure 9-7) to save that 
page’s address.
You can save a Web page address in a couple of ways:
 
✓ Page Address: This option allows you to view the Web address of the 
current page through a pop-up screen, which presents you with two 
options to act on:
 
• Copy Address saves the page’s address on your BlackBerry 
Clipboard and allows you to paste it somewhere else.
 
• Send Address presents another screen so that you can choose 
whether to send the address by e-mail, MMS, PIN, or SMS. See 
Chapter 7 for more on sending e-mail messages and Chapter 8 for 
MMS, PIN, and SMS.
 
✓ Save Page: Use this option to save the Web address of the current page 
to Messages. A message appears with the Browser globe icon to indicate 
that it’s a Web link, as shown in Figure 9-8. Scrolling to that entry and 
pressing the trackball launches Browser and opens the page for your 
viewing pleasure.
 
 Saving a page to your message list has a different purpose than book-
marking a page. When you save a page to your message list, you can 
mark the page as unread, like an e-mail message, to remind yourself to 
check back later.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Use the 
Browser 
menu to 
save a 
Web page 
address.

 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-8:

page link in 
Messages.
 
Note: When you do not have network coverage and you try to access a Web 
page, you’re prompted to save your request. When you do, your request is 
automatically saved in the message list. When you do have coverage later, 
you can open the same Web page from the message list, with the content 
loaded already!
 
Pressing a letter key while a menu appears selects the first menu item that 
starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter again selects the next menu 
item that starts with that letter.
Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via an e-mail by using the Page 
Address option on the Browser menu. For a more direct way, simply select 
Send Address from the Browser menu while the Web page is displayed. If you 
know right away that you’re going to send an address to someone, use the 
more direct method. It saves you a couple of clicks.
Saving Web images
If you have a BlackBerry with a color screen, you can view and save pictures 
or images from a Web page. You can save images of JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP 
formats. Any saved image is kept in the Pictures application, which enables 
you to view it later, even when you are out of coverage. To save it from the 
Web page, click the image you want to save and then select Save Image from 
the menu that appears.

182
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize all the addresses of your favorite sites. 
BlackBerry Browser allows you to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In 
other words, make a bookmark so that you can come back to a site quickly.
Adding a bookmark
On the page you want to bookmark, select Add Bookmark from the Browser 
menu. Remember that the menu is always accessible by pressing the Menu 
key. Enter the name of the bookmark and then select the folder where you 
want to save the bookmark in the Add Bookmark dialog box (as shown in 
Figure 9-9). The default folder is BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save the 
bookmark in folders that you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, 
skip ahead to the section “Adding a bookmark subfolder.”
The next time you want to go to a bookmarked page, return to the Bookmarks 
screen by choosing Bookmarks from the Browser menu. From this screen, 
you can find all the pages you bookmarked. Just highlight the name of the 
bookmark and press the Enter key to open that page.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Specify the 
name and 
the folder 
in which to 
store the 
bookmark.
 
Changing your Home screen background
This is a neat trick. You can use an image that 
you have saved in your pictures list as the back-
ground on your Home screen. Here’s how:
 1. From the Home screen, select the Media 
icon and then select Pictures.
 
 The Pictures application opens.
 2. Scroll to and select the image you want to 
set as your background.
 3. Press the Menu key and then select Set as 
Home Screen Image.

183
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
Available offline
The Add Bookmark dialog box includes an Available Offline check box, which 
you might be wondering about. If that check box is selected, you not only 
save a page as a bookmark, but you are also caching it so that you can view 
it even when out of network coverage (like when you’re stuck deep in a 
mountain cave). So, the next time you click the bookmark, that page comes 
up very fast.
We recommend that you create bookmarks to search engines (such as 
Google) available offline because the content of the initial search page is not 
likely to change from day to day.
 
If you’re working with version 3.8 or later of the BlackBerry OS, the Bookmarks 
screen appears by default when you open Browser.
Modifying a bookmark
Changing a bookmark is a snap. Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
 
 To open the Bookmarks screen, select Bookmarks from the Browser 
menu.
 
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to modify, press the 
Menu key, and then select Edit Bookmark.
 
3. On the screen that follows, you can edit the existing name, the 
address the bookmark is pointing to, or both.
 
4. Select Accept to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow. A tiny screen can make 
it tough to find a certain site. You can organize your bookmarks by using 
folders and help work around this problem. For example, you can group 
related sites in a folder, and each folder can have one or more folders inside 
it (subfolders). Having a folder hierarchy narrows your search and allows 
you to easily find a site.
For example, your sites might fall into these categories:
 
✓ Reference
 
 NY Times
 
 Yahoo!

184
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Fun
 
 Flickr
 
 The Onion
 
✓ Shopping
 
 Etsy
 
 Gaiam
Adding a bookmark subfolder
Unfortunately, you can only add subfolders to folders that are already listed 
on the Bookmark page. That is, you can’t create your own root folder. Your 
choices for adding your first subfolder are under WAP Bookmarks or 
BlackBerry Bookmarks.
Suppose that you want to add a Reference subfolder within your BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
 
1. On the Bookmarks screen, highlight BlackBerry Bookmarks.
 
 The initial folder you highlight is the parent of the new subfolder. So in 
this case, the BlackBerry Bookmarks folder will contain the Reference 
subfolder.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Add Subfolder, as shown in 
Figure 9-10.
 
 You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the folder.
 
3. Enter the name of the folder (as shown in Figure 9-11) and use the 
trackball to select OK.
 
 We named our folder Reference. The Reference folder appears on the 
Bookmarks screen (as shown in Figure 9-12), bearing a folder icon.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Add a folder 
here.

just added.
 
Renaming a bookmark folder
Renaming a bookmark folder you’ve created is as easy as editing a bookmark. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
 
2. Highlight the name of the folder you want to change.
 
3. Press the Menu key.
 
 A menu appears.
 
4. Select Rename Folder.
 
5. Type the name of the folder.
 
6. Select OK to save your changes.

186
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Moving your bookmarks
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think exists in a 
particular folder but is instead in another, move that bookmark where it 
belongs. Follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the bookmark, press the Menu key, and select Move 
Bookmark.
 
2. Use the trackball to move the bookmark to the location in the list 
where you want it to appear.
 
3. After you find the right location, press the trackball.
 
 Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Cleaning up your bookmarks list can help you keep organized. On the 
Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the bookmark you want to delete, 
press the Menu key, and select Delete from the menu that appears.
 
You can clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting an entire folder. However, 
if you delete a folder, you delete the contents of that folder as well, so purge 
with caution.
Exercising Options and Optimization 
Techniques
Browser works out of the box. But everyone has his or her own taste, right? 
You can look to Browser Options for Browser attributes and features you can 
customize:
 
1. Press the Menu key.
 
2. Select Options.
 
 The Browser Options screen offers three main categories to choose 
from, as shown in Figure 9-13:
 
• Browser Configuration: A place to toggle Browser features.
 
• General Properties: Settings for the general look and feel of 
Browser.
 
• Cache Operations: Allows you to clear file caches used by Browser.
If you feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the sidebar “Speeding 
up browsing,” later in this chapter.

187
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-13:

Browser 
Options 
screen.
 
Configuring Browser
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser Configuration 
screen, which you access from the Browser Options screen. The customization 
items you can amend (shown in Figure 9-14) are as follows:
 
✓ Support JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used heavily to 
make dynamic Web pages. A Web page might not behave normally when 
this option is turned off. This option is off by default on the latest 
BlackBerry smartphones with OS 4.6 onwards including Bold, Storm, 
Pearl Flip, and Curve 8900.
 
✓ Allow JavaScript Popups: Most ad pages are launched as JavaScript 
pop-ups. So, having this check box selected minimizes these ads. But 
be aware that some important pages are also displayed as JavaScript 
pop-ups. (Note that this option only shows up if you select the Support 
JavaScript check box.)
 
✓ Terminate Slow Running Scripts: Sometimes you find Web pages with 
scripts that aren’t written well. Keep this selected to keep Browser from 
hanging. (Note that this option only shows up if you select the Support 
JavaScript check box.)
 
Figure 9-14: 
The 
Browser 
Configur-
ation 
screen.
 

188
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Use Background Images: A Web page background image can make 
the page look pleasing, but if the image is big, it could take time to 
download it.
 
✓ Support Embedded Media: Select this option to support media such 
as SVG (scalable vector graphics). Think of it as Flash for mobile 
devices such as the BlackBerry. SVG can be a still image or an 
animated one.
 
✓ Show Images: Controls the display of images depending on the content 
mode of WML, HTML, or both. Think of WML pages as Web pages made 
just for mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry. We recommend leaving 
this selected for both.
 
 Turn on and off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not 
display images.
 
✓ Browser Identification: Specifies which browser type your browser 
emulates. The default is BlackBerry, but Browser can also emulate these 
instead:
 
• Microsoft Internet Explorer
 
• Firefox
 
 We don’t see much difference in their behavior, so we recommend 
emulating the default BlackBerry mode.
 
✓ Start Page: Allows you to specify a starting page to load when you open 
Browser.
 
✓ Home Page Address: Allows you to set your home page. Note that the 
home page is always available from the Browser menu.
General Browser properties
The General Properties screen does the same thing as the Browser Configuration 
screen (see the preceding section): It lets you customize some Browser 
behaviors. This screen, however, is geared more toward the features of the 
Browser content. As shown in Figure 9-15, you can do this:
 
✓ Configure features
 
✓ Turn on features
 
✓ Turn off features

189
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
 
Figure 9-15: 
The General 
Properties 
screen.
 
From this screen, you use the Space key to change the value of a field. You 
can configure the following features by selecting from the choices:
 
✓ Default Browser: If you have multiple browsers available, use this to 
specify which one you want to use when opening a Web link.
 
✓ Default Font Family: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font, 
Browser will use the one you selected here.
 
✓ Default Font Size: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font size, 
Browser will use the one you selected here. The smaller the size, the 
more text fits on the screen.
 
✓ Minimum Font Size: A Web page may specify a font size too small to be 
legible. Specifying a legible font size will override the Web page.
 
✓ Minimum Font Style: When Browser is using the minimum font size, you 
can choose what font to use. Some fonts are more legible, even in small 
size, than others. If you’re not sure which one to use, leave the default 
untouched.
 
✓ Default View: You can toggle the default view:
 
• Column wraps all Web page elements vertically, so you just scroll 
up and down by panning the page.
 
• Page displays the page like you normally see in your PC’s Internet 
browser. Pan the page to scroll left, right, up, and down.
 
✓ Image Quality: The higher the quality, the slower the page loads. The 
default quality is medium. You have three options: low, medium, and 
high.
 
✓ Repeat Animations: Sets the number of times an animation repeats. The 
default is 100, but you can change this setting to
 
• Never
 
• Once

190
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
• 10 Times
 
• 100 Times
 
• As Many as the Image Specifies
 
✓ Enable JavaScript Location Support: Web pages that have scripts that 
take advantage of your BlackBerry’s location through GPS will work if 
you have this selected.
 
✓ Prompt Before: You can have BlackBerry Browser give you a second 
chance before you do the following things:
 
• Closing Browser on Escape: You’re notified right before you exit 
BlackBerry Browser.
 
• Closing Modified Pages: You’re notified right before you exit a 
modified Web page (for example, some type of online form you 
fill out).
 
• Running WML Scripts: WML is a script that tells a wireless device 
how to display a page. It was popular years ago when resolutions 
of device screens were low, but very few Web sites are using it 
now. We recommend leaving this field deselected because this 
type of scripting is old and benign.
Cache operations
 
At any given time, your BlackBerry uses a few cache mechanisms. A cache 
(pronounced cash) temporarily stores information used by Browser so that 
the next time the info is needed, Browser doesn’t have to go back to the 
source Web site. The cache can speed up displays when you want to view 
the Web page again and is also useful when you’re suddenly out of network 
coverage. When you visit a site that uses cookies, Browser caches that cookie. 
(Think of a cookie as a piece of text that a Web site created and placed in 
your BlackBerry’s memory to remember something about you, such as your 
username.)
 
Browser also caches pages and content so that you can view them offline — 
which is handy when you’re out of network range.
 
Some Web sites push (send information) Web pages to BlackBerry devices. An 
icon will appear on the Home screen allowing you to quickly view the page. 
After the Web page is delivered to your BlackBerry, it becomes available even 
if you go out of the coverage area. If you subscribed to this service, your 
device will have Web pages stored in the cache. Also, the addresses of the 
pages that you visited (or your latest 20 in your history list) comprise a cache.

191
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
The Cache Operations screen, shown in Figure 9-16, allows you to manually 
clear your cache. To view the Cache Operations screen, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Browser screen, press the Menu key.
 
2. Select Options.
 
3. Select Cache Operations.
The size for each type of cache is displayed on this screen. If the cache has 
content, you also see the Clear button, which you can use to clear the 
specified cache type. This is true for all types of cache except for history, 
which has its own Clear History button. You find four types of cache:
 
✓ Content Cache: Any offline content. You might want to clear this 
whenever you’re running out of space on your BlackBerry and need 
to free some memory. Or maybe you’re tired of viewing old content or 
tired of pressing the Refresh option.
 
✓ Pushed Content: Any content that was pushed to your BlackBerry from 
Push Services subscriptions. You might want to clear this to free 
memory on your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. You might want 
to clear this for security’s sake. Sometimes you don’t want a Web site to 
remember you.
 
✓ History: This is the list of sites you’ve visited by using the Go To 
function. You might want to clear this for the sake of security if you 
don’t want other people knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on 
your BlackBerry.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Installing and Uninstalling 
Applications from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry by using 
Browser — that is, if the application has a link that lets you download and 
install the files. The downloading and installing parts are easy. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the link from Browser.
 
 It displays a simple prompt that looks like the screen shown in 
Figure 9-17.
 
2. Click the Download button.
 
 The download starts.
Speeding up browsing
On a wireless network, many factors can affect 
the speed with which Web pages display. If you 
find that browsing the Web is extremely slow, 
you can make your pages load faster in 
exchange for not using a few features. Here are 
some of the techniques you can use:
 ✓ Don’t display images. You can see a big 
performance improvement by turning off 
the display of images. From the Browser 
menu, select Browser Options➪Browser 
Configuration, scroll to Show Images, and 
change the value to No.
 ✓ Make sure that your BlackBerry is not low 
on or out of memory. When your Black
Berry’s memory is very low, its performance 
degrades. The BlackBerry low-memory 
manager calls each application every now 
and then, telling each one to free 
resources.
 
 Hint #1: Don’t leave many e-mail messages 
unread. When the low-memory manager 
kicks in, Messages tries to delete old 
messages, but it can’t delete those that 
are unread.
 
 Hint #2: You can also clean up the 
BlackBerry event log to free needed space. 
Enter the letters LGLG while holding the 
Shift key. This opens an event log, where 
you can clear events to free memory.
 ✓ Turn off other features. If you’re mostly 
interested in viewing content, consider 
turning off features that pertain to how the 
content is processed, such as Support 
HTML Tables, Use Background Images, 
Support JavaScript, Allow JavaScript 
Popups, and Support Style Sheets. To turn 
off other browser features, navigate to 
Browser Options➪General Properties.
 
 Warning: We don’t advise turning off fea-
tures while performing an important task 
such as online banking. If you do, you might 
not be able to perform some of the actions 
on the page. For example, the Submit button 
might not work.

193

an applica-
tion on your 
BlackBerry.
 
As long as you stay within network coverage while the download is progress-
ing, your BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application 
for you. If it finishes without any problems, you see a screen similar to 
Figure 9-18.
As with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work for a 
variety of reasons.
 
Sometimes the application requires you to install libraries, and sometimes the 
application works only on a certain version of the BlackBerry OS. These issues 
can be prevented, depending on the sophistication of the site where the link is 
published. With most reputable sources, these issues are considered — and 
successful downloading and installation are a snap.
 
Installing applications from nonreputable sources can cause your BlackBerry 
to become unstable. Before you download an application from the Web, be 
sure to read reviews about that particular application. Most of the time, other 
people who tried the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t be the first 
to write the bad review!

Your BES administrator can disable the feature in your BlackBerry to down-
load and install an application. This is mostly the case for a company-issued 
device. If you have problems downloading and installing an application, 
check your company policy or contact the BlackBerry support person in your 
company.
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to 
uninstall it. See Chapter 19 for more on uninstalling an application from your 
BlackBerry.
Browser’s Behavior in an 
Enterprise Environment
Getting a device from your employer has both a good and an ugly side:
 
✓ On the good side, your company foots the bill.
 
✓ On the bad side, your company foots the bill.
Because your company pays for the bill, the company has a say in what you 
can and can’t do with your BlackBerry device. This is especially true with 
respect to browsing the Web.
Two scenarios come into play when it comes to your browser:
 
✓ Your browser might be running under your company’s BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server (BES). With this setup, your BlackBerry Browser is 
connecting to the Internet by using your company’s Internet connection. 
It’s like using your desktop machine at work.
 
✓ Your browser is connected through a network service provider. Most of 
the time, this kind of browser is called by the company’s name.
In most cases, your device fits in only one scenario, which is the case where 
your browser is connected through your company’s BES server. Some lucky 
folks might have both. Whatever scenario you’re in, the following sections 
describe the major differences between the two and indicate what you can 
expect.
Using Browser on your company’s BES
In an enterprise setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connected through your 
company’s BES server. With this setup, the browser is actually named 

195
 Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
BlackBerry Browser. BES is located inside your company’s intranet. This 
setup allows the company to better manage the privileges and the functions 
you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser application, this setup allows the company to 
use the existing Internet infrastructure, including the company’s firewall. 
Because you are within the company’s network, the boundaries that your 
network administrator set up on your account apply to your BlackBerry as 
well. For example, when browsing the Web, your BlackBerry won’t display 
any Web sites that are blocked by your company’s proxy server. The good 
thing, though, is that you can browse by using the company’s intranet.
 
Know your company’s Web-browsing policy. Most companies keep logs of the 
sites you view on your browser and might even have software to monitor 
usage. Also, your company might not allow downloading from the Web.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with 
its own branded Web browser. It’s the same BlackBerry Browser, but the 
behavior might differ in the following ways:
 
✓ The name is different.
 
✓ The default home page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s 
Web site is full of links that you might not find on BlackBerry Browser.
 
✓ You can browse more sites. You’re not limited by your company’s 
policy.
 
Most of the time, if your browser is through BES, surfing the Web is much 
faster. This is not true in all cases, however, because the network bandwidth 
of your BES affects the speed.
Setting the default browser
If you have more than one Web browser on your device, you have the option 
to set the default browser. This comes into play when you view a Web 
address by using a link outside the browser application. For example, when 
you view a contact with a Web page in Contacts, the Contacts menu contains 
a Get Link option. Clicking Get Link launches the default browser.

196
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
To set up the default browser, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Home screen.
 
2. Select Settings➪Options➪Advanced Options➪Browser.
 
3. Use the Space key to change the value of the default browser 
configuration, as shown in Figure 9-19.

▶ Customizing your BlackBerry Phone setup
▶ Conferencing with more than one person
▶ Talking hands-free on your BlackBerry phone
▶ Multitasking with your BlackBerry phone
T
he BlackBerry phone operates no differently than any other phone you’ve 
used. So why bother with this chapter? Although your BlackBerry phone 
operates like any other phone, it has capabilities that far outreach those of 
your run-of-the-mill cellphone. For example, when was the last time your 
phone was connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an e-mail and 
placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with your 
BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
In this chapter, we first cover phone basics and then show you some of the 
neat ways BlackBerry Phone intertwines with other BlackBerry applications 
and functions.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
Accessing the Phone application from the BlackBerry is a snap. You can 
press the green Send button located right below the display screen to get 
into the Phone application.
You can get to the Phone application also by pressing any of the numeric 
keys. To do this, however, you have to make sure that the Dial from Home 
Screen option is enabled in Phone Options. If you’re a frequent phone user, 
we recommend that you enable this option.

198
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Throughout this section, we assume that you have the Dial from Home 
Screen option enabled if you’re using a non-SureType model.
 
On a BlackBerry Pearl, you don’t need to go through the following steps. 
Because Pearl is designed for heavy phone use, Dial from Home Screen isn’t an 
option.
To enable dialing from the Home screen, follow these steps:
 
1. From your BlackBerry, press the green Send key.
 
 Phone opens, showing the dial screen as well as your call history list.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
 
3. Select General Options.
 
4. Highlight the Dial from Home Screen option, press the trackball, and 
then select Yes from the drop-down list.
 
 This enables you to make a phone call by pressing the numeric keys 
when at the Home screen.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
Making and Receiving Calls
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential 
Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, start from the Home screen and type the phone number you 
want to dial. As soon as you start typing numbers, the Phone application 
opens. When you finish typing the destination number, press the green 
Send key.
Calling from Contacts
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and colleagues’ phone 
numbers, calling from Contacts is convenient and useful. To call from 
Contacts, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Phone application.
 
2. Press the Menu key.
 
 The Phone menu appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.

199
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
Figure 10-1:

menu on a 
BlackBerry

other 
models).
 
 
3. Select Call from Contacts.
 
 Contacts opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact 
you’d like to call.
 
4. From Contacts, highlight your call recipient, press the trackball, and 
then select Call.
 
 This makes the call.
Dialing letters
 
One of the nice features of BlackBerry Phone is that you can dial letters, and 
BlackBerry will figure out the corresponding number. For example, to dial 
1-800-11-LEARN, do the following on your BlackBerry:
 
1. From the Home screen or the Phone application, dial 1-8-0-0-1-1.
 
 As you type the first number, the Phone application opens (if it isn’t 
open already) and displays the numbers you dialed.
 
2. Press and hold the Alt key and then dial (press) L-E-A-R-N.
 
 The letters appear on-screen as you type.
 
3. Press the green Send key.
 
 The call is initiated.
Receiving a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You 
can receive calls in a couple of ways. One is by using your BlackBerry’s 
automated answering feature, and the other is by answering manually.
Automated answering is triggered whenever you take your BlackBerry out 
of your holster; in other words, just taking out the BlackBerry forces it 
to automatically pick up any call, so you can start talking right away. The 

200
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
disadvantage of this is that you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on 
your caller ID). Note: To disable autoanswering, be sure that your BlackBerry 
isn’t in its holster when an incoming call arrives.
What’s the advantage of disabling autoanswering? Well, manual answering 
prompts you to answer a call or ignore a call when you receive an incoming 
call, as shown on the left side of Figure 10-2. This way, you can see on your 
caller ID who is calling you before you decide to pick up or ignore the call.
 
If you have a BlackBerry Pearl Flip, when you have an incoming call, you can 
see the caller ID on the front cover display screen, as shown on the right side 
of Figure 10-2.
 
Figure 10-2:

Handling missed calls
So, you missed that call from that important client. What made it worse is 
that you didn’t notice the missed call because you didn’t see the little Missed 
Call icon. This happened because you pay attention only to what is in your 
e-mail message box. What can you do to make sure that you return that call?
 
You can make missed calls appear in your e-mail message box so that you are 
sure to return your missed calls (if you choose to, that is).
To have your missed calls appear in your inbox, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Phone application.

201
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
2. Press the Menu key.
 
 The Phone menu appears (refer to Figure 10-1).
 
3. Select Options.
 
 The phone options screen appears, listing the different categories of 
options.
 
4. Select Call Logging.
 
 This opens the Call Logging screen.
 
5. Scroll to Missed Calls and press the trackball.
 
 You can also select All Calls, which means that incoming and outgoing 
calls will be displayed in your e-mail inbox.
 
6. Press the Menu key and select Save.
Phone Options while on a Call
When you’re on the phone, situations might arise where you’d want to 
mute your conversation, place a call on hold, or change the call volume. 
No problem. BlackBerry makes such adjustments easy.
Muting your call
You might want to use the Mute feature while on a conference call (see the 
upcoming section “Arranging Conference Calls”) when you don’t need to 
speak but do need to hear what is being discussed. Maybe you’re on the bus 
or have kids in the background, making your surroundings noisy. By using 
Mute, these background noises are filtered out from the conference call.
To mute your call, follow these steps:
 
1. While in a conversation, press the Menu key.
 
 The Phone menu appears in all its glory.
 
2. Select Mute.
 
 You hear a tone, indicating that your call is being muted.
Follow these steps to unmute your call:
 
1. While a call is on mute, press the Menu key.
 
 The Phone menu makes another appearance.

202
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
2. Select Turn Mute Off.
 
 You hear a tone, indicating that your call is now unmuted.
Placing your call on hold
Unlike muting a call, placing a call on hold prohibits both you and your caller 
from hearing one another. To put a conversation on hold, follow these steps:
 
1. While in a conversation, press the trackball.
 
 The Phone menu appears yet again.
 
2. Scroll to Hold and press the trackball.
 
 Your call is now on hold.
Follow these steps to unhold your call:
 
1. While a call is on hold, press the trackball.
 
 A new menu appears.
 
2. Scroll to Resume and press the trackball.
 
 You can continue your conversation.
Adjusting the call volume
Adjusting the call volume, a simple yet important action on your BlackBerry 
phone, can be performed by simply pressing the volume up or volume down 
key on the side of your BlackBerry.
Customizing the BlackBerry Phone
For your BlackBerry phone to work the way you like, you have to first set 
it up the way you want it. In the following sections, we go through some 
settings that can make you the master of your BlackBerry phone.
Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number. 
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary, 

203
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
depending on your service provider. However, most service providers are 
more than happy to walk you through the steps to get your mailbox set 
up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail access number, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Phone application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
 
 A list of phone options appears.
 
3. Select Voice Mail.
 
 This opens the voice mail configuration screen.
 
4. Scroll to access the number field and enter your voice mail access 
number.
 
 If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, contact your 
service provider and ask for your voice mail access number.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
Using call forwarding
On the BlackBerry, you have two types of call forwarding:
 
✓ Forward all calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are forwarded to the 
number you designate. Another name for this feature is unconditional 
forwarding.
 
✓ Forward unanswered calls: Calls that meet different types of conditions 
are forwarded to different numbers as follows:
 
• If busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the 
phone.
 
• If no answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or somehow are 
unable to pick up your phone (perhaps you’re in a meeting).
 
• If unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and cannot receive 
any signals.
Out of the box, your BlackBerry forwards any unanswered calls, regardless of 
conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can add new 
numbers to forward a call to.
You need to be within network coverage before can you change your call 
forwarding option. After you’re within network coverage, you can change 
your call forwarding settings by doing the following:

204
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. Open the Phone application, press the Menu key, and select Options.
 
 A list of phone options appears.
 
2. Select Call Forwarding.
 
 Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the server. If successful, 
you’ll see the Call Forwarding screen.
 
 If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network 
coverage and try again.
 
3. From the Call Forwarding screen, press the Menu key and then select 
Edit Numbers.
 
 A list of numbers appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call 
forwarding, mostly likely only your voice mail number is in this list.
 
4. To add a new forwarding number, press the Menu key and then select 
New Number.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, prompting you to enter the new forwarding 
number.
 
5. In the pop-up window, enter the number you want to forward to and 
then press the trackball.
 
 The new number you entered now appears on the call forward number 
list. You can add this new number to any call forwarding types or 
conditions.
 
6. Press the Escape key.
 
 (The Escape key is the arrow key to the right of the trackball.) You are 
returned to the Call Forwarding screen.
 
7. Scroll to the If Unreachable field and press the trackball.
 
 A drop-down list appears, listing numbers from the call forwarding 
number list, including the one you just added.
 
8. Select the number you want to forward to and then press the 
trackball.
 
 Doing so places the selected number into the If Unreachable field. You 
can see this on the Call Forwarding screen.
 
9. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and then selecting 
Save.
Configuring speed dial
Speed dial is a convenient feature on any phone. And after you get used to 
having it on a phone system, it’s hard not to use it on other phones, including 
your BlackBerry phone.

205
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
Viewing your speed dial list
To view your speed dial list, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Phone application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select View Speed Dial List.
 
 This displays a list of speed dial entries, as shown in Figure 10-3. If you 
haven’t set up any speed dials, this list will be empty.
 
Notice in Figure 10-3 that the * key and # key have hard-set functions. This is 
the same on all BlackBerry models (QWERTY and SureType). Basically this is 
the shortcut for locking your BlackBerry screen (* key) and changing your 
profile to Quiet (# key).
 
Figure 10-3: 
The speed 
dial list on a 
BlackBerry 
Pearl Flip.
 
Adding a number to speed dial
Setting up speed dial numbers is as easy as using them. It takes a few 
seconds to set them up, but you benefit every time you use this feature.
To assign a number to a speed dial slot, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Phone application.
 
2. Press the Menu key, select Options, and then select View Speed 
Dial List.
 
 This displays your list of speed dial numbers.
 
3. Scroll to an empty speed dial slot, press the Menu key, and then select 
New Speed Dial.
 
 The BlackBerry Contacts appears so that you can select a contact’s 
phone number.
 
4. Select a contact, and then press the trackball.
 
 If more than one number is associated with the selected contact, you’re 
prompted to select which number to add to the speed dial list.
 
 The number appears in the speed dial list.

206
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Using speed dial
After you have a few speed dial entries set up, you can start using them. To 
do so, while on the Home screen or in the Phone application, press a speed 
dial key. The call is initiated to the number associated with that particular 
speed dial key.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two or more people on the phone with you — the infamous 
conference call — do the following:
 
1. Use the Phone application to place a call to the first participant.
 
2. While the first participant is on the phone with you, press the Menu 
key and then select New Call.
 
 This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a New Call 
screen, as shown in Figure 10-4, prompting you to place another call.
 
3. Place a call to the second participant by dialing a number, pressing 
the trackball, and then selecting Call.
 
 You can dial the number by using the number pad, or you can select a 
frequently dialed number from your call log. To place a call from your 
Contacts, press the trackball from the New Call screen and select Call 
from Contacts. Your BlackBerry then prompts you to select a contact 
to dial.
 
 The call to the second meeting participant is just like any other phone 
call (except that the first participant is still on the other line).
 
Figure 10-4: 
A meeting 
participant 
is on hold.
 

207
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
4. While the second participant is on the phone with you, press the 
Menu key and then select Join Conference, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 This reconnects the first participant with you, along with the second 
participant. Now you can discuss away with both participants at the 
same time.
 
Another name for having two people on the phone with you is three-way 
calling, which is not a new concept. If you want to chat with four people or 
even ten people on the phone at the same time, you certainly can. Simply 
repeat Steps 2 through 4 until all the participants are on the phone.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Join two 
people in a 
conference 
call.
 
Talking privately to a conference 
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one participant privately. 
This is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. While on a conference call, press the Menu key and then select 
Split Call, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, listing all the participants of the 
conference call.
 
2. From the pop-up screen, select the participant with whom you want to 
speak privately.
 
 This action places all other participants on hold and connects you to the 
participant you selected. On the display screen, you can see to whom 
you are connected — this confirms that you selected the right person to 
chat with privately.

208
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
Figure 10-6: 
Split your 
conference 
call.
 
 
3. To talk to all participants again, press the Menu key and then select 
Join Conference.
 
 Doing so brings you back to the conference call with everyone.
Alternate between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re 
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch 
between the two conversations by swapping them. Follow these steps:
 
1. While talking to someone with another person on hold, press the 
Menu key and then select Swap.
 
 Doing so switches you from the person with whom you’re currently 
talking to the person who was on hold.
 
2. Repeat Step 1 to go back to the original conversation.
Dropping that meeting hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you can identify those chatty “meeting 
huggers” who have to say something about everything. Don’t you wish that 
you could drop them off the call? Well, with your BlackBerry, you can (as 
long as you are the meeting moderator or the person who initiates the call). 
Follow these steps to perform the drop-kick:
 
1. While on a conference call, press the Menu key and then select 
Drop Call.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, listing all conference call participants.

209
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
2. Select the meeting hugger you want to drop.
 
 That person is disconnected.
 
3. Everyone else now can continue the conversation as usual.
Communicating Hands-Free
Because more and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a 
hands-free headset, we thought we’d go through the hands-free options you 
have on your BlackBerry.
Using the speaker phone
The Speaker Phone function is useful under certain situations, such as when 
you’re in a room full of people who want to join your phone conversation. 
Or you might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck rooting 
through your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up against your 
ear. (We call such moments multitasking — a concept so important we devote 
an entire upcoming section to it.)
To switch to the speaker phone while you’re on a phone call on the Pearl 
Flip, press the OP key. If you are on a non-SureType BlackBerry, press the 
Menu key and then select Activate Speaker Phone.
Pairing your BlackBerry with 
a Bluetooth headset
Because BlackBerry smartphones come with a wired hands-free headset, you 
can start using yours by simply plugging it into the headset jack on the left 
side of the BlackBerry. You adjust the volume of the headset by pressing up 
or down on the volume keys, the same as you would adjust the call volume 
without the headset.
Using the wired hands-free headset can help you avoid being a police target, 
but if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry, the wired headset can get in 
the way and become inconvenient.
This is where the whole Bluetooth wireless thing comes in. You can purchase a 
BlackBerry Bluetooth headset to go with your Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry. 
For a list of BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headsets, see Chapter 20.

210
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
After you purchase a BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headset, you can 
pair it with your BlackBerry. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with 
your BlackBerry as registering the headset with your BlackBerry so that it 
recognizes the headset.
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now, each head-
set manufacturer has a different take on this, so you’ll need to consult your 
headset documentation for details. With that out of the way, continue with 
the pairing as follows:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select Bluetooth.
 
2. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu.
 
 You see the Enable Bluetooth option. If you see the Disable Bluetooth 
option instead, you can skip to Step 4.
 
3. Scroll to Enable Bluetooth and then press the trackball.
 
 This enables Bluetooth on your BlackBerry.
 
4. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select 
Add Device.
 
 You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progressing, as 
shown in Figure 10-7. When your BlackBerry discovers the headset, a 
Select Device dialog box appears with the name of the headset.
 
5. From the Select Device dialog box, select the Bluetooth headset.
 
 A dialog box appears to prompt you for a passkey code to the headset.
 
6. Enter the passkey and press the trackball.
 
 Normally, the passkey is 0000, but refer to your headset documentation. 
After you successfully enter the passkey, you see your headset listed in 
the Bluetooth setting.
 
Figure 10-7: 
Searching 
for a 
headset.
 

211
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
7. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select 
Connect.
 
 Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
 
8. When you see a screen similar to Figure 10-8, you can start using your 
Bluetooth headset.
 
Figure 10-8: 
Now 
you can 
use your 
Bluetooth 
headset.
 
Using voice dialing
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly be hands-
free from your BlackBerry. You may be thinking, how do I activate the Voice 
Dialing application without touching my BlackBerry? Good question. The 
majority of hands-free headsets (Bluetooth or not) come with a multipurpose 
button.
 
Usually, a multipurpose button on a hands-free headset can mute, end, and 
initiate a call. Refer to the operating manual of your hands-free headset for 
more info.
After your headset is active, press its multipurpose button to activate the 
Voice Dialing application. You will be greeted with a voice stating, “Say a 
command.” At this point, simply say “Call” and state the name of a person or 
say the number. (For example, say “Call President Obama” or “Call 555-
2468.”) The Voice Dialing application is good at recognizing the name of the 
person and the numbers you dictate. However, we strongly suggest that you 
try out the voice dialing feature before you need it.

212
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Multitasking while on the Phone
One of the great things about the BlackBerry is that you can use it for other 
tasks while you’re on the phone. For example, you can take notes or make a 
to-do list. Or you can look up a phone number in BlackBerry Contacts that 
your caller is asking you for. You can even compose an e-mail while on a call.
 
It makes sense to multitask while you’re using a hands-free headset or a 
speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck to your BlackBerry, and 
you couldn’t engage in your conversation and multitask at the same time.
Accessing applications while on the phone
After you have donned your hands-free headset or have turned on a speaker 
phone, you can start multitasking by doing the following:
 
1. While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the Menu 
key and then select Home Screen.
 
 Alternatively, you can simply press the Escape key (the arrow key to the 
right of the trackball) while in the Phone application to return to your 
Home screen. This returns you to the Home screen without terminating 
your phone conversation.
 
2. From the Home screen, you can start multitasking.
 
With the exception of GSM 3G (HSPAD) network, you can compose e-mails 
during a phone conversation, but you can’t send the e-mail until you finish 
the phone conversation. In addition, you can’t surf the Web while on the 
phone. With GSM 3G network, you can receive and send emails, as well as 
browse the Web.
While on the phone and multitasking, however, you can still access the 
Phone menu from other applications. For example, from your to-do list, you 
can end a call or put a call on hold.
Taking notes while on the phone
To take notes of your call, follow these steps:
 
1. During a phone conversation, press the Menu key and then select 
Notes.
 
 This displays the Notes screen.
 
2. Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 10-9.
 
 When the call ends, the notes are automatically saved for you.

213
 Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person
 
Figure 10-9: 
Take notes 
while on a 
phone call.
 
Accessing phone notes
From the call history list (see Figure 10-10), you can access notes that you’ve 
made during a call or a conference call. In addition, you can also edit and add 
new notes.
 
Figure 10-10: 
Call history, 
where you 
can see 
conversa-
tion notes.
 
Forwarding phone notes
You can forward your phone notes just like any e-mail. While on the Call 
History screen (refer to Figure 10-10), press the Menu key and then select 
Forward.
 
You can add notes not only while you’re on the phone but also afterward. 
While you are viewing a call history, press the Menu key. Then select Add 
Notes if you have no notes for the call, or select Edit Notes if you already have 
notes for the call.

O
h shoot, you forgot your camera. Don’t worry! Your BlackBerry’s 
there when you need to capture the unbelievable: Grandma doing 
a handstand, Grandpa doing a cartwheel, or your roommate doing her 
laundry. And if pictures aren’t enough, you can record your unbelievable 
scene in full motion.
Before you try taking pictures or have the BlackBerry camera rolling, read 
this chapter so that you know what to expect and how to get the best shot. 
We also walk you through the easy steps in capturing that funny pose. We tell 
you how to store those photos and videos. We also show you how to share 
the joy with your buddies.
Say Cheese: Taking Pictures
Before you ask someone to pose, examine your BlackBerry (shown in 
Figure 11-1) first:
 
✓ Is the camera on? You see the bottom key on the right side of your 
BlackBerry? Press it to bring up the Camera application. Alternatively, 
you can select the Camera icon from the Home screen.

216
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ Is your finger blocking the lens? The lens is on the back side of your 
device.
 
✓ Do you see the image on the screen? Pressing the Camera key again 
takes the picture. You should hear a funky sound. Neat and easy, isn’t it?

 Chapter 11: Taking Pictures and Recording Video with Your BlackBerry
Hey, you can take a picture of yourself as well. Turn the BlackBerry around 
(so that you see its back), and you see a mirror right below the lens. 
Whatever you see in that mirror is what the camera captures.
Itching to take more pictures? Hold those snapping fingers of yours. If you 
take a few moments first to familiarize yourself with the camera’s features, 
the effort could go a long way.
Reading the screen indicators
When you open the Camera application, the first thing you see is the screen 
shown in Figure 11-1. The top portion of this screen shows you the image 
you’re about to capture. The bottom part contains icons (starting from the 
left) that indicate the following:
 
✓ Number of pictures you can capture
 
✓ Zoom
 
✓ Flash
Choosing the picture quality
The latest BlackBerry smartphones including the Curve 8900 can capture 
up to 3.2 megapixels (MP) of resolution. Some BlackBerry models including 
Bold and the earlier Curve and Pearl have 2 MP resolution. Still, saving at this 
resolution requires a lot of space. You can save at a lower quality and save 
some space on your BlackBerry. You have three resolutions to choose from:
 
✓ Normal
 
✓ Fine
 
✓ SuperFine
 
The default setting is Normal, which is the lowest quality but lets you save the 
most pictures. The trade-off is that Normal picture quality won’t be as smooth 
or fine compared to the Fine and SuperFine settings. You should choose a 
setting based on how you plan to use the picture. If you’re taking a shot of a 
breathtaking landscape in which you want to capture every possible detail 
and print it later, you’ll want the SuperFine setting. On the other hand, if 
you’re just taking pictures of your friends’ faces so that you can attach them 
as caller IDs, Normal is appropriate.
Changing picture quality is a snap. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Camera application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Options.

218
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
3. Highlight Picture Quality and then press the Space key.
 
 Pressing the Space key toggles the picture quality value among Normal, 
Fine, and SuperFine. You may have to press the Space key twice to 
select the setting you want.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Save.
 
 The picture quality you’ve chosen is now active.
Zooming and focusing
You need to be steady to get a good focus while taking the shots. Although 
it’s convenient to use one hand while taking pictures, most of the time, you’ll 
get a blurry image if you try that.
 
When taking pictures, hold your BlackBerry with both hands, one holding the 
device steady and the other clicking the shutter button.
Holding the camera with both hands is even more important if you’re 
zooming in. Yes, your camera is capable of up to 5x digital zoom. Here’s 
what you need to do to focus and zoom:
 
✓ To focus: Press the Camera key halfway.
 
✓ To zoom in: Slide the trackball up.
 
✓ To zoom out: Slide the trackball down.
While zooming, the value in the indicator changes from 1x to 2x to 5x and 
vice versa, depending on the direction you scroll.
 
When zooming, your thumb is already on the trackball. What a convenient 
way to take the picture — just press.
 
Although we took the pain in describing you the zooming capabilities, we 
don’t recommend using them. Digital zoom (which is what your camera has) 
gives poor results because it’s done through software and degrades the 
quality of the picture. The higher the zoom factor, the more pixilated the 
picture becomes.
Setting the flash
The rightmost indicator on the Camera screen is the flash. The default is 
Automatic, which shows a lightning bolt with the letter A. Automatic means 
that the camera detects the amount of light you have at the moment you 
capture the image. Where it’s dark, the flash fires; otherwise it doesn’t.

219
 Chapter 11: Taking Pictures and Recording Video with Your BlackBerry
 
You can turn the flash on or off. When set to off, the lightning bolt is encircled 
with a diagonal line, just like you see on No Smoking signs. You can toggle the 
settings on the camera’s Options screen, which is accessible by pressing the 
Menu key.
Setting the white balance
In photography, filters are used to compensate for the dominant light. For 
instance, a fluorescent versus an incandescent light could affect how warm 
the picture appears. Instead of using filters, most digital cameras have 
a feature to correct or compensate for many types of light settings. This 
feature is white balance. And yes, your BlackBerry has this feature. You can 
choose from Sunny, Cloudy, Night, Incandescent, Fluorescent, and Automatic. 
Automatic means your camera determines what it thinks are the best settings 
to apply.
You can change the white balance through the camera’s Options screen.
 
The camera’s Options screen is accessible by pressing the Menu key and 
selecting Options from the menu that appears.
Setting the picture size
Aside from picture quality, you can also adjust the actual size of the photo:
 
✓ Large: 1600 x 1200
 
✓ Medium: 1024 x 768
 
✓ Small: 640 x 480
Again, camera settings are accessible through the camera’s Options screen 
by pressing the Menu key and selecting Options from the menu that appears.
Geotagging
Because your BlackBerry has GPS capability, your location can be easily 
determined based on longitude and latitude. This information can be 
added to your media files, including the pictures taken from your BlackBerry. 
Adding geographic information is referred to as geotagging. On your 
BlackBerry, it adds longitude and latitude information. Now, you don’t have 
to wonder where you took that crazy pose.

220
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Geotagging is disabled by default in your BlackBerry. You can simply enable 
it from the camera’s Options screen. (Press the Menu key and select Options 
to get to the Options screen.)
 
If you have longitude and latitude information from one of your photos, 
you can use one of the free sites on the Web to locate where you were when 
you took the photo. One such site is www.travelgis.com/geocode/
default.aspx.
Working with Pictures
You’ve taken a bunch of pictures and you want to see them. And maybe 
delete the unflattering ones. Or perhaps organize them. No problem.
Viewing
If you take a picture, you want to see it, right? Viewing a picture is a common 
function with your camera. You can see the image you just captured right 
then and there, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
If you’re browsing through your picture folders, you can view a picture by 
highlighting it and pressing the trackball.

Creating a slide show
Want to see your pictures in a slide show? Follow these steps:
 
1. While on the Camera screen, press the Menu key and select View 
Pictures from the menu that appears.
 
2. Press the Menu key.
 
3. Select Slide Show.
 
 Voilà! Your BlackBerry displays your pictures one at a time at a regular 
time interval. The default interval between each picture is two seconds; 
if you’re not happy with this interval, change it in the Options screen. 
(Press the Menu key and select Options to get to the Options screen.)
Trashing
If you don’t like the image you captured, you can delete it. Follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the picture you want to trash.
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Delete from the menu that appears; 
alternatively, press the Del key.
 
 A confirmation screen appears.
 
3. Select Delete.
You can also delete an image right after taking the picture; just select the 
Trash Can icon when viewing the photo. (Refer to Figure 11-2.)
Listing filenames versus thumbnails
When you open a folder packed with pictures, your BlackBerry automatically 
lists thumbnails, which are small previews of your pictures.
A preview is nice, but what if you’re trying to search for a picture file and 
you know the filename? Wouldn’t it be nice to see a list of filenames instead 
of thumbnails? You can view filenames by following these steps:
 
1. Go to a picture folder.
 
2. Press the Menu key.
 
3. Select View List.

222
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
 That’s exactly what you get: a list of all the pictures in the folder. What’s 
neat is that the option also displays the file size. The file size can 
give you a clue about what settings you used to take the picture. For 
example, a photo taken at a SuperFine quality produces a much bigger 
file size compared to one taken at Normal.
Checking picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is using? Want to know 
the time you took the photo? You can view a picture’s properties as follows:
 
1. Highlight the picture from a list.
 
 While you’re on the Camera screen, you can view the list of your 
pictures by pressing the Menu key and selecting View Pictures.
 
2. Press the Menu key.
 
3. Select Properties.
 
 You see a screen similar to Figure 11-3, which displays the picture’s 
location, size, and last modification.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Your 
picture’s 
properties.
 
Organizing your pictures
Organization is all about time and the best use of it. After all, you want to 
enjoy looking at your pictures — not looking for them. The BlackBerry 
enables you to rename and move pictures to different folders. Plus, you can 
create folders, too. With those capabilities, you should be on your way to 
organization nirvana.

223
 Chapter 11: Taking Pictures and Recording Video with Your BlackBerry
Renaming a picture file
BlackBerry saves a file when you capture a picture. However, the name of the 
picture is generic, something like IMGxxxx, where x is a number.
 
Make it a habit to rename a photo as soon as you’ve finished capturing it. It is 
easier to recognize Dean blows birthday candles than IMG0029-20081013-0029.
Renaming is a snap. Here’s how:
 
1. Display the picture screen or highlight it in the list.
 
2. Press the Menu key and select Rename.
 
 A Rename screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
3. Enter the name you want for this picture and then select Save.
 
 Your picture is renamed.
 
Figure 11-4: 
Rename 
your picture 
here.
 
Creating a new folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about the 
folders we mentioned. Don’t fret; it’s simple to create one. Here’s how:
 
1. On the Camera screen, press the Menu key and then select View 
Pictures.
 
 The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder and an Up 
icon for you to navigate up to the folder above this folder.
 
2. Select the Up icon to navigate to the main folder where you want your 
new folder to be created.
 
 You should be within the folder where you want your new folder to be 
created. If not, repeat this step and use your trackball to navigate to 
that folder.
 
3. Press the Menu key and then select New Folder.

224
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
4. Enter the name of the folder and then select OK.
 
 Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
There are many reasons for moving pictures between folders. The most 
obvious reason is to organize your pictures. Want to try it? Follow 
these steps:
 
1. On the Camera screen, press the Menu key and then select View 
Pictures.
 
 The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder. If the 
picture you want to move is not in this folder, click the Up icon to 
navigate up to other folders.
 
2. Highlight the picture you want to move, press the Menu key, and then 
select Move.
 
 The screen that follows allows you to navigate to the folder where you 
want to move this picture.
 
3. Click the Up icon and use the trackball to navigate to the folder where 
you want to move this picture.
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Move Here.
 
 Your picture is moved.
Sharing your pictures
Where’s the joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing them? 
Your BlackBerry has several options for sharing your bundle of joy:
 
1. On the Camera screen, press the Menu key and select View Pictures.
 
2. Highlight a picture you want to share.
 
3. Press the Menu key.
 
4. Select from the choices listed here:
 
• Send as Email: This goes directly to the Message screen for 
composing e-mail, with the currently selected picture as an 
attachment.
 
• Send as MMS: Similar to Send as Email, this opens a Compose MMS 
screen with the currently selected picture as an attachment. The 
only difference is that MMS first displays Contacts, letting you 
select the person’s phone number to receive the MMS before going 
to the Compose screen. Another difference is that in the MMS it 
sends a tiny version of the picture.

225
 Chapter 11: Taking Pictures and Recording Video with Your BlackBerry
 
• Send to Messenger Contact: This option is available if you have 
BlackBerry Messenger installed. A similar function as Send as 
MMS, but only displays contacts you have in BlackBerry 
Messenger. It uses BlackBerry Messenger to send a tiny version 
of the picture file.
 
• Send Using Bluetooth: This allows you to send the picture to any 
device capable of communicating through Bluetooth.
You may also see other ways to send a picture file if you have other IM 
clients installed. For example, if you have Google Talk installed, you will see 
Send as Google Talk.
Setting a picture as caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice if, when your girlfriend was calling, you also could see 
her beautiful face? You can do that. If you have a photo of her saved in your 
BlackBerry, follow these steps to use her picture as caller ID:
 
1. Select the Media icon from the Home screen and select Pictures.
 
2. Navigate to the location of your pictures.
 
3. Highlight the photo you want to appear when the person calls.
 
 If you don’t have pictures of your friends, now’s the time to start 
clicking.
 
4. Press the Menu key and select Set as Caller ID.
 
 The photo is displayed on-screen with an inner portrait-size rectangle 
that displays a clear view with the outside vague. The clear view 
represents the portion of the photo that shows up as caller ID. You can 
slide the trackball to make sure that you capture the face. Cropping it 
is the last step.
 
5. Press the trackball and select Crop and Save.
 
 Contacts appears.
 
6. Select the contact you want this picture to appear for.
 
 A message indicating a picture is set for that contact appears. You’re set.
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the background 
image for your BlackBerry. Follow these steps to set the image:

226
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
1. Select the Media icon from the Home screen and select Pictures.
 
2. Navigate to the location of your pictures.
 
3. Highlight the picture you want to use as your Home screen image.
 
4. Press the Menu key and select Set as Home Screen Image.
 
 You can always reset the Home screen image by going to the Menu 
screen and selecting Reset Home Screen Image.
Setting Camera Memory Options
The camera in your BlackBerry is a piece of hardware and a computer pro-
gram. As such, the good people at RIM (Research In Motion) incorporated 
some parameters that you can set so that you can enjoy your camera fully 
while not affecting other features that share the same memory.
 
You should know the following two options:
 
✓ Device Memory Limit: The amount of device memory your camera can 
use. The values are 12MB, 15MB, 20MB, and 25MB (1MB is 1000K). To 
get a feel for how many pictures this is, look at the properties of an 
existing picture in the format you take most often and note its file size. 
The size of the picture depends on the format you use to take it.
 
✓ Reserved Pictures Memory: The amount of memory BlackBerry 
reserves for the camera to store pictures. Possible values are 0MB, 2MB, 
5MB, 8MB, 10MB, and 12MB. This value can’t be set greater than the 
Device Memory Limit value.
Say Action: Capturing Video
The Camera application is a multipurpose one. You can also use it to 
take videos.
Here are the quick and easy steps to use Video Camera mode:
 
1. Open the Camera application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Video Camera (see Figure 11-5).
 
 The screen displays like a viewfinder on a typical digital video camera, 
as shown in Figure 11-6. Use the trackball to start recording.

mode here.
 
 
Figure 11-6:

The controls you see on the screen are all context related. When you first 
launch the video camera, all you see is the Record button with the big white 
dot at the bottom of the screen (shown in Figure 11-6). By using the trackball 
to select the Record button, the video camera starts taking video and the 
only available control is a Pause button.
You can use the Escape key to show the rest of the controls, as you can see 
in Figure 11-7. The controls are the familiar buttons you see on a typical 
video recorder/player. From left to right, they are as follows:
 
✓ Record: Continue recording.
 
✓ Stop: End the current recording.
 
✓ Play: Play the current video you just recorded.
 
✓ Rename: Rename the video file.
 
✓ Delete: Get rid of the video file of the current recording.
 
✓ Send: Share your current video recording. You have the option to send 
it as e-mail, as MMS, or through Bluetooth. If you have IM clients 
installed, such as Google Talk or Y! Messenger, the IM client will be 
listed as one of the options for sending the video file.

Customizing the Video Camera
Even with its size, your BlackBerry has a few settings you can tweak to 
change the behavior of the video camera. And like every other BlackBerry 
application, to see what you can customize, don’t look anywhere else 
but the application’s Options screen — in this case, the Video Camera 
Options screen.
Follow these steps to get to the Video Camera Options screen:
 
1. Open the Camera application.
 
2. Press the Menu key and then select Video Camera (refer to 
Figure 11-5).
 
3. Press the Menu key and select Options.
 
 The Options screen displays, as shown in Figure 11-8.
The available options are quite easy to digest, but in case you need a little 
help, here’s what you can tweak:
 
✓ Video Light: In case it’s a little dim, you can turn the video camera’s 
lights on. Note that this is a drain on your battery.
 
✓ Color Effect: The default is Normal, which is “what you see is what you 
get.” If you are in the mood for effects, you can choose from either Black 
& White or Sepia.

229
 Chapter 11: Taking Pictures and Recording Video with Your BlackBerry
 
✓ Video Format: The default here is Normal, but if you are planning to 
send your video to friends through MMS, you can choose the MMS 
mode, which has the smaller size and is optimal for MMS.
 
✓ Folder: You can use this to change the default location where your 
BlackBerry saves the video file.

I
f one word describes today’s phone market trends, it’s convergence. 
Your BlackBerry is one of the latest participants in this convergence 
race. We probably don’t have to tell you this, but in addition to sending and 
receiving e-mail and being a phone, a camera, and a PDA device, your 
BlackBerry is a portable media player.
In the palm of your hand, you can
 
✓ Listen to music
 
✓ Record and watch video clips
 
✓ Sample ring tones
 
✓ Snap and view pictures
These capabilities are bundled into an application with a name you’d 
recognize even after sipping a couple of pints of strong ale — Media.
Accessing Media
 
 To run Media, simply select the Media icon from the Home screen. The 
Media icon is very easy to distinguish, because it has the image of a CD and 
a musical note.

232
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Media is a collection of media applications:
 
✓ Music
 
✓ Video
 
✓ Ring tones
 
✓ Pictures
 
✓ Voice Notes
And upon opening Media, each one is represented with an icon, as shown in 
Figure 12-1. You don’t need to be Einstein to figure out what each one of 
these media applications is used for. Ready to have some fun?

Let the music play
To play music on your BlackBerry, you don’t need a quarter. Just select 
Music from the Media screen. Several potential views of your music 
collection appear, as shown in Figure 12-2. Music is the screen heading. 
The views include the following:
 
✓ All Songs: Displays all your music files in alphabetical order.
 
✓ Artists: Lists your music files by artist so that you can play your John 
Mayer songs in one go.
 
✓ Albums: Lets you view your music collection one album at a time.
 
✓ Genres: If you prefer not to mingle your country with your cutting-edge 
techno, navigate through this view.
 
✓ Playlists: Organize and play songs as you prefer — the perfect mix tape!

233
 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
 
✓ Sample Songs: When you’re dying to check the player but haven’t yet 
put your collection into the BlackBerry, go here. Your smartphone 
comes with a couple of songs, and you can find them here.
 
✓ Shuffle Songs: Life is all about variety, and when you’re tired of the song 
order in your playlist, select this.
After you choose a view, select one of the songs to start playing it. After 
BlackBerry starts playing a song, it plays the rest of the music listed in the 
view you selected. The standard interface shown in Figure 12-3 doesn’t 
require explanation.
 
There is no fast forwarding or rewinding in a traditional way, but you can 
position where you start playing by moving the progress slider. Use the 
trackball to select the progress slider, and then scroll the trackball to change 
the slider’s position. Press the trackball again, and the music starts playing 
from that position.

234
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
BlackBerry supports many music formats. The following list shows the 
supported formats, along with the file extensions:
 
✓ ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, and EAAC+ (.aac 
and .m4a)
 
✓ AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate–Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech coder 
standard (.mmr and .3gp)
 
✓ MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (.mid, .midi, and .smf)
 
✓ MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (.mp3 and .mp4)
 
✓ WMA: Windows Media Audio 9, Pro, and 10 (.wma and .asf)
 
The earpiece/mic combo that comes with your BlackBerry is only for one 
ear. This might be an issue when you are in a noisy area. To improve your 
experience, you can buy a stereo headset. And yes, a Bluetooth headset is 
a good option.
Now showing
Playing or recording a video is very similar to playing music. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select Video from the Media screen.
 
 The screen shows Video Camera, and a list of video files appears at the 
bottom. If you want to watch a video, skip to Step 5.
 
2. To start video recording, select Video Camera.
 
 A screen shows the image in front of the camera.
 
3. Select the screen again to start recording.
 
 Don’t wait for “Cut!” You can pause the camera by selecting the Pause 
button. The familiar video/audio controls appear, from left to right, 
showing
 
• Continue recording
 
• Stop
 
• Play
 
 The functions of the other buttons are also obvious, including the 
following:
 
• Rename (for the filename)
 
• Delete
 
• Send via E-Mail

235
 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
 
4. Press the Stop button when you’re ready to wrap up your home video.
 
 You wind up at the previous screen with the video clip file listed. We 
know you’re itching to watch it.
 
5. Select the file to play it on-screen.
Wondering on how to get recorded videos to your PC? The later section 
“Working with Media Files” gives you the scoop on transferring files between 
your BlackBerry and PC.
Lord of the ring tones
Ah, the proliferation of ring tones. Nothing beats hearing a loud funky ring 
tone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train. You can wake other passen-
gers, too, whether you want to use the Top 40, old-fashioned digital beats, 
or something you recorded.
Of course you want to hear ring tones that come with your BlackBerry. It 
offers a bunch of them, so enjoy. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select Ring Tones from the Media screen.
 
 You see three views:
 
• All Ring Tones
 
• My Ring Tones
 
• Preloaded Ring Tones
 
2. Select Preloaded Ring Tones.
 
 The preloaded ring tones are displayed.
 
3. Select any one of them and enjoy.
 
 While playing a ring tone, select the right arrow to go to the next tone; 
select the left arrow to go the previous one.
 
4. Choose a ring tone you like.
 
5. Press the Menu key and select Set as Ring Tone.
 
 That ring tone is what plays when your phone rings.
 
A ring tone is similar to a music file and includes the same music formats:
 
✓ ACC
 
✓ M4A
 
✓ MIDI

236
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
✓ MMR
 
✓ MP3
 
✓ WMA
If you’re familiar with any audio-editing software, you can make your own 
ring tones. Save the file in one of the formats in the previous list and copy it 
to your BlackBerry (see the “Working with Media Files” section, later in this 
chapter, to see how to copy files from your PC to your BlackBerry). The 
Internet is also filled with ring tones, and many are free. The only possible 
harm from downloading one is being annoyed with how it sounds. The 
default home page on Browser (http://mobile.blackberry.com) has 
links to sources of ring tones as well. See Fun and Pages on the home page.
Picture this
Folks who upgraded from an older BlackBerry may know Pictures, which lets 
you view, zoom into, and rotate pictures. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select Pictures from the Media screen.
 
 Your options are similar to those for other Media applications.
 
2. Navigate to the view you want.
 
3. Find the picture you’re looking for.
 
4. Select the file.
 
 Pretty easy, right?
 
Check out Sample Pictures. Your BlackBerry comes with nice pictures that 
you can use as the Home screen background. You can assign a cartoon to a 
contact as a caller ID until you get a chance to take the person’s picture. Or 
don’t take the picture.
Zoom to details
Is that a pimple? No, it’s not. Let’s zoom in.
While viewing an image, press the trackball and select Zoom. A tiny unobtru-
sive slider bar appears on the left side of the image. Now, use your trackball: 
Scrolling up zooms in, and scrolling down zooms out.
While scrolling, the slider bar indicates the degree of zoom. The exact center 
of this bar is the original image (no zooming applied). You can easily go back 
to the original zoom size by pressing the Menu key and selecting Zoom All.
 
An image normally defaults to fit the screen, but you can toggle it by pressing 
the Menu key and selecting one of these options:

237
 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
 
✓ Fit to Screen
 
✓ View Actual Size
Rotate it
Want to view yourself upside down? Maybe not. But sometimes your pictures 
may look better when viewed horizontally.
While you’re viewing an image in Pictures, press the trackball and select 
Rotate. The image rotates 90 degrees clockwise. By repeating the same 
steps, you can keep rotating it; each time is an additional 90-degree clockwise 
rotation.
Recording your voice
A feature-packed smartphone like your BlackBerry should come with a 
voice recorder, and it does. Within Media, you can find Voice Notes, a neat 
recording application. Now you can record your billion-dollar ideas without 
having to type every detail. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select Voice Notes (that little microphone icon) from the Media screen.
 
 The Voice Notes application launches, sporting the simple and clean 
screen shown in Figure 12-4. At the top of the screen is a Record button, 
and the bottom part lists your previous recordings.
 
2. To record, select Record.
 
3. When you’re ready to record, press the trackball.
 
 Your BlackBerry’s microphone is designed to be close to your mouth, 
like any mobile phone should be.
 
 You can pause anytime you want by selecting the Pause button. A famil-
iar video/audio control appears, from left to right:
 
• Continue recording
 
• Stop
 
• Play
 
 Other buttons include Rename for renaming the file, Delete, and Send 
via E-Mail.
 
4. Press the trackball and select the Stop button to wrap it up.
 
 You return to the previous screen. Your recent voice recording appears 
in the list.
 
5. Select your voice recording to play it when you need to type up your 
brilliant idea.

Viewing and Controlling Media Files
The previous sections show what types of files you can record or play on 
your BlackBerry. The following sections give you the lowdown on controlling 
those files when you’re playing or viewing them.
Turning it up (or down)
Whether you’re listening to music or watching a video, adjusting the volume 
is easy.
 
Your BlackBerry comes with dedicated volume buttons. They’re located on 
the upper-right side of the device. The top button with the plus sign turns 
the volume up, and the one with the minus sign turns the volume down. The 
volume slider you see on the screen reflects any presses you made on the 
volume buttons.
Navigating the menu
You can easily jump to the next item in the list. Press the Menu key while you 
are viewing an image, listening to songs, or watching a video clip. On the 
menu that appears, you see the following items:
 
✓ Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This item appears only if there’s 
an item after this media file in the current folder.
 
✓ Previous: Jumps to the previous item. This item appears only if there’s a 
previous item in the current folder.
 
✓ Delete: Deletes the media file.
 
✓ Move: Moves the file to a different folder.

239
 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
 
✓ Rename: Renames the media file.
 
✓ Properties: Displays a screen that shows the location of the media file, 
its size, and the time it was last modified.
Changing the media flavor
Like the rest of your BlackBerry applications, you can customize things to be 
the way you prefer. Do it through the Options screen inside Media:
 
1. Press the Menu key while in Media.
 
2. Select Options.
 
 The screen looks like the one shown in Figure 12-5. You can specifically 
customize the Pictures application and Media in general. Each is 
described in the following sections.
Customizing pictures
You can change the Picture application in the following ways:
 
✓ Sort By: Allows you to toggle file sorting based on recent updates 
or name.
 
✓ Thumbnails per Row: When your files appear as a grid of thumbnails 
(small versions of your photos), this number of thumbnails is displayed 
per row. The higher the number, the smaller the thumbnails.
 
✓ Slide Show Interval: When viewing your files in a slide show, a picture 
appears for this many seconds before moving to the next picture.
 
✓ Exclude Folders: You don’t want to display any of the pictures inside 
this folder. This makes it faster to load the list of pictures. (The fewer 
the pictures you have, the faster the Picture application can load the 
list.) This option isn’t for your secret folders.
 
Figure 12-5: 
The Media 
Options 
screen.
 

240
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Customizing media
You can finesse the rest of Media as follows:
 
✓ Turn Off Auto Backlighting: Your BlackBerry has a feature called back-
lighting that provides additional screen lighting when it detects that you 
need it. You will notice it when you move your BlackBerry from shade to 
direct sunlight. If backlighting bothers you when you’re watching a 
movie, this is the place to toggle it off. Turning off backlighting also 
extends battery life.
 
✓ Audio Boost: You can set it to On or Off.
 
✓ Headset Equalizer: The default is Off, but if you want to have a different 
audio setting, you have several options, including Bass Boost, Bass 
Lower, Dance, Hip Hop, Jazz, Lounge, Loud, R&B, Rock, Treble Boost, 
Treble Lower, and Vocal Boost.
Working with Media Files
The ways of finding media files are evolving. Ten years back, who would 
have thought that you could buy music from a tiny card or download music 
from an “all you can eat” monthly subscription?
Someday, you’ll wake up with a technology that doesn’t require you to 
constantly copy media files to your handheld music player. But for now, 
enjoying music while on the move means managing these files.
Media is a great music player, but without music files, it’s as useless as a 
guitar without strings.
Media shortcuts
It’s all about saving your valuable time. Taking 
the time to master these shortcuts now will pay 
you back in time later. Here are the must-know 
Media shortcuts:
 ✓ Mute: Toggles between pausing and play-
ing music and video. (The key is located at 
the upper right of the device and has a 
muted-speaker label.)
 ✓ 6: Moves to the next item.
 ✓ 4: Moves to the previous item.
 ✓ 3: Zooms in on a picture.
 ✓ 9: Zooms out on a picture.
 ✓ 5: Zooms back to the original picture size.
 ✓ , (comma): Rotates a picture counterclock-
wise.
 ✓ Space: Toggles between pausing and 
resuming a slide show.

process that converts music files in CD format to other popular compressed 
formats.) RIM licensed a portion of Roxio and packaged it with BlackBerry 
Desktop Software. Even though it’s not the whole suite of Roxio software, 
that’s still good news for you because you can now avail yourself of fantastic 
features, such as
 
✓ Ripping CDs
 
✓ Converting files to get the best playback on your BlackBerry
 
✓ Managing music files
 
✓ Syncing media files to your device
 
Do you have an old version of Media Manager? No problem. Point your desk-
top Internet browser to http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/
desktop for directions on downloading the latest version for free and 
installing it on your PC.
In the following sections, we familiarize you with the Media Manager interface 
and then show you how to copy a video file into your BlackBerry.
Accessing Media Manager
You can get to Media Manager through BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
Chapter 15 describes in detail. Get to Desktop Manager on your PC by 
following these steps:
 
1. Click the Windows Start button.
 
2. Select All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
3. Click the Media icon.
 
 A screen displays showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
 
4. Click the Start button in the Media Manager section.
 
 The initial Media Manager screen is well organized and gives you the 
following options:
 
• Manage Pictures
 
• Manage Music
 
• Manage Videos
 
• View Connected Devices
 
5. Click one of the options.

When you see the Media Manager screen shown in Figure 12-7, it may look 
intimidating. But it’s really easy to use — plus, it has the same interface as 
Windows Explorer:
 
✓ The left side is where you navigate to your folders and files.
 
✓ The right side displays the files in the folder you’ve currently selected 
on the left.

 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
The top section looks the same as the bottom section except that the top 
represents your desktop and the bottom represents the BlackBerry, and 
they’re named My Media and My Devices, respectively. You can move or 
copy files easily. When you’re copying, for example, one section can be the 
source and the other section can be the destination. By simply dragging the 
files between the two sections, you can copy on the same screen. Neat, right?
Importing media files to Media Manager
Want a quick and easy way to import media files? Follow these steps:
 
1. Use Windows Explorer to get to the media files you want.
 
2. Drag and drop the files into Media Manager.
 
You can drag and drop files to the folder in the left part of the screen, where 
the folder tree appears, or the right part, where the files are listed. Just make 
sure that when you’re doing the latter, the current folder in the tree view is 
the folder where you want the media files to be imported.
Without using Windows Explorer, you can also use Media Manager to locate 
the files you want. The trick is to change the upper-left-side view in one of the 
sections to Folders. If you look closely at the upper-left section, you see two 
tabs. The first tab, My Media, is the default view. The Folders tab has the icon 
of — guess what? — a folder.
Click the Folder icon. You see a tree view, but this time it looks exactly as you 
see it in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 12-8. The files can be on your 
local hard drive or in a network folder accessible by your desktop computer.

Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Adding a media file to the BlackBerry
After you’re familiar with the Media Manager, get those files copied to your 
BlackBerry. Here’s the rundown:
 
1. Connect the BlackBerry to your desktop computer with the USB cable 
that came with the device.
 
2. On the Media Manager screen, drag and drop your media files from 
the My Media view to any folder in My Devices.
 
 You can drag and drop an entire album. After dropping a media file, 
you’re prompted to convert the file into a format that’s viewable by your 
BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 12-9.
 
Figure 12-9: 
Choose to 
convert your 
media files 
for optimum 
playback.
 
 
3. Choose an option:
 
• Convert for Optimal Playback: This is the safest bet and is the 
default.
 
• Copy with No Conversion: Copies the file faster. The file is copied to 
your BlackBerry as is, but it might not play in your BlackBerry.
Other features of Media Manager
Spend some time exploring Media Manager. It 
has interesting features you might find useful. 
Here’s a quick rundown of what you can do 
with Media Manager:
 ✓ Import media files
 ✓ E-mail media files
 ✓ Record audio
 ✓ Enhance photos and apply special effects 
to photos by using PhotoSuite
 ✓ Set song info, such as title, artist, album, 
genre, year, or an image, to show as track 
art when playing the song
 ✓ Customize photo printing

 Chapter 12: Getting Entertained with Your BlackBerry
 
• Advanced Conversion Options: From here, another screen lets you 
downgrade the quality to minimize the file size. It also allows you 
to crop video so that the entire screen is filled, instead of seeing 
dark margins.
 
4. Click OK to begin the transfer.
Synchronizing with iTunes using 
BlackBerry Media Sync
If you have an iPod, you’re probably using iTunes and maintaining a playlist 
and perhaps a subscription to podcasts or videocasts. Podcast files are 
downloaded to iTunes using RSS. To clarify the jargon, RSS is short for Really 
Simple Syndication, a kind of digital file publish-subscribe mechanism. This is 
the mechanism iTunes uses to receive audio and video recordings, which 
most people refer to as podcasts and videocasts. Would you like to sync your 
BlackBerry with iTunes? Wouldn’t we all? Follow these quick and easy steps 
to sync your BlackBerry and iTunes:
 
1. Click the Windows Start button.
 
2. Select All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears (refer to Figure 12-6).
 
3. Click the Media icon.
 
 A screen displays showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
 
4. Click the Start button in the BlackBerry Media Sync section.
 
 A pop-up screen appears, like the one shown in Figure 12-10. Note the 
double-arrow icon in the lower-left portion of the screen. Clicking this 
icon gives you options for what part of iTunes you want to synchronize.
 
Figure 12-10:

5. Click the lower-left Show iTunes Playlist icon.
 
 A selection of what you have in iTunes appears, as shown in Figure 
12-11. This is the part of the screen where you choose iTunes media 
file types.
 
6. Select the iTunes media you want to have copied to your BlackBerry.
 
7. Click the Sync button.
 
 There you go. You see a progress bar showing the synchronization of 
the media files from iTunes.
 
Figure 12-11:

Downloading sounds
RIM has set up a Web site from which you can download new ring tones. 
Simply go to http://mobile.blackberry.com/homepage?book=
ringtone_catalog&lang=en&accept=yes on your BlackBerry, and you 
get a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 12-12. From this page, you 
can sample and download alarms, notifiers, and tunes. And did we mention 
that they’re free?
The ring tone plays when you select it from the three categories. After the 
tune plays, you can save it by pressing the Menu key and selecting Save. RIM 
isn’t the only site where you can find ring tones. The Web is a wonderful 
place, and ring tones or other media files are safe to download, so go hunting.

Transferring media files 
using the microSD card
When you’re in a hurry, running Desktop Manager and opening Media 
Manager could be a drag. One quick option is to copy your media files 
directly to microSD using the familiar Windows Explorer on your PC. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Connect your BlackBerry to your computer using the USB cable that 
came with your device.
 
 Make sure that you have the microSD card in your BlackBerry before 
you do this. When connected, the BlackBerry screen displays a prompt 
for enabling mass storage mode.
 
2. On the BlackBerry screen, select Yes.
 
 Another screen appears on the BlackBerry asking for your password.
 
3. On the BlackBerry screen, type your BlackBerry password.
 
 The device is now ready to behave like an ordinary flash drive. And on 
your PC, a screen appears with the heading Removable Disk, which 
displays a couple of options to choose from. One such option is Open 
Folder to View Files.

248
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
 
4. On your PC (Removable Disk screen), click Open Folder to View Files 
and then click OK.
 
 This opens the familiar Windows Explorer screen. You can do anything 
you typically do with a normal Windows folder. You can drag and drop 
files, copy files, and delete files.
 
5. Click the X button located in the top-right corner of the Windows 
Explorer when you’re done.

Chapter 13
Getting Around with 
Your BlackBerry GPS
In This Chapter
▶ Using GPS safely
▶ Preparing to use GPS on your BlackBerry
▶ Choosing a GPS application
A
 few years back when some of the network carriers in North America 
introduced GPS on their version of the BlackBerry, we were quite 
impressed . . . until we tried it. The response time was slow, and it wasn’t 
accurate. On top of that, the network carriers charged users an arm and a 
leg for this inferior service. As it turns out, those GPS functions were imple-
mented by using the network. What does that mean? There wasn’t an actual 
GPS embedded in the BlackBerry. How low-tech!
Today, many BlackBerry models come with a built-in GPS within the smart-
phone itself, which makes finding yourself easy. If you don’t have one built in, 
you can purchase a GPS puck and connect to your BlackBerry via Bluetooth 
connection.
In this chapter, we show you how to use your BlackBerry’s built-in GPS (and 
how to connect your BlackBerry to an external GPS device if your BlackBerry 
doesn’t have it built in). We then show you the best GPS applications you can 
use on your BlackBerry (two of which are free!).
Putting Safety First
 
Some GPS features are useful not only while you’re walking on the street 
but also while you’re driving a car. Although you’ll be tempted to use your 
BlackBerry GPS while driving, we strongly suggest that you do not adjust it 
while you’re driving.

250
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
Before you start using BlackBerry GPS in your car, you need to get a BlackBerry 
car holder (preferably a car kit with a car charger). You can buy a car kit on 
the Internet by doing a simple search for BlackBerry car kit. Or go to one of the 
following Web sites:
 
✓ www.shopblackberry.com
 
✓ http://shop.crackberry.com
Now that you have all you need to keep you safe, keep on reading.
What You Need
For GPS to work on your BlackBerry, it needs navigation maps, which are 
usually downloaded in little pieces as required. And because these maps are 
downloaded, to obtain them you must be subscribed to a data plan and have 
a radio signal.
 
If you did not subscribe to an unlimited data plan from your network carrier, 
be aware that the more you use your GPS as you move about, the more data 
(map pieces) you’ll download, which means the more charges you’ll incur.
In summary, for your BlackBerry GPS to work, you need
 
✓ A BlackBerry with a built-in GPS or a BlackBerry connected to a GPS puck 
via Bluetooth. GPS pucks are inexpensive, check out Freedom GPS 2000, 
which you can get from http://shop.crackberry.com/freedom-
keychain-gps-2000/10A95A2869.htm.
 
✓ A data plan from your network carrier (we recommend an unlimited 
data plan)
 
✓ To be in an area where you have a radio signal (so that you can down-
load the maps)
In this book, we don’t cover the exact steps on how to pair up a Bluetooth-
enabled BlackBerry to an external GPS, because the steps vary slightly 
depending on which external GPS as you have. But the general steps are as 
follows:
 
1. Make sure that your external GPS is ready for pairing.
 
 Refer to your external GPS for more information on how to prepare it for 
“discovery.”
 
2. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and then select the 
Options (wrench) icon.
 
3. Select Bluetooth.

251
 Chapter 13: Getting Around with Your BlackBerry GPS
 
4. Press the Menu key and then select Enable Bluetooth.
 
 You see a screen of paired Bluetooth devices or, if you’ve never paired 
with a device, you see a blank screen.
 
 Pairing with a Bluetooth device simply means to connect with another 
Bluetooth device, such as a hands-free headset.
 
5. Press the Menu key and then select Add Device.
 
 Your BlackBerry starts scanning for a nearby device. Make sure that 
your external GPS is next to your BlackBerry.
 
6. Follow the on-screen instructions on your BlackBerry to finish pairing 
with your external GPS.
 
 This step usually involves entering a 4-digit password to pair up with the 
GPS. Refer to your GPS manual for further information.
Your GPS Application Choices
We have identified the following four GPS applications that you can use on 
your BlackBerry:
 
✓ BlackBerry Map
 
✓ Google Maps
 
✓ Garmin Mobile
 
✓ TeleNav GPS Navigator
Both BlackBerry Map and Google Maps are free. The icons for all of them are 
pictured in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1:

252
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
BlackBerry Map
Out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with the BlackBerry Map application 
(refer to Figure 13-1).
 
If you have a BlackBerry with AT&T as your network carrier, you might not 
have BlackBerry Map installed out of the box. No worries; you can download it 
via mobile.blackberry.com. We also show you alternatives to BlackBerry 
Maps that still take advantage of your BlackBerry GPS.
With or without GPS (built-in or external), you can use BlackBerry Map to do 
the following (see Figure 13-2):
 
✓ Find a location by typing an address or by using Contacts
 
✓ Get point-to-point directions
 
✓ E-mail or SMS a location to colleagues and friends
 
✓ Turn GPS on or off
 
✓ Zoom in and out of the map
Of course, with GPS turned on, you can track where you are and follow point-
to-point directions.
 
Figure 13-2:

Google Maps
Google Maps is the mobile version of http://maps.google.com. It has 
most of the features of the online version, including satellite imaging and traf-
fic information. Best of all, it’s free.

253
 Chapter 13: Getting Around with Your BlackBerry GPS
Like BlackBerry Map, you can use Google Maps even without a GPS, but it gets 
better. You can search for businesses and landmarks, just as you do on http://
maps.google.com. It’s like having the ultimate 411 (with a map) at the tip of 
your fingers.
Because Google Maps does not come with your BlackBerry, you need to 
download it. To do so, go to www.google.com/gmm. After the program 
downloads, its icon appears on your Home screen (refer to Figure 13-1).
After Google Maps is loaded, press the Menu key to display the menu shown 
in Figure 13-3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
Google 
Maps menu.
 
From the menu, you can do the following:
 
✓ Find businesses and landmarks, including phone numbers, address 
information, and Web addresses
 
✓ Find and map exact addresses
 
✓ Get step-by-step directions from point A to point B
 
✓ View satellite images of the current map (see Figure 13-4)
 
✓ Get traffic information for major highways
With GPS or Google’s MyLocation on, you can see your current location as a 
blue blinking dot.
Here are some keyboard shortcuts for Google Maps:
 
✓ Zoom in: I key or JK key on the SureType keyboard
 
✓ Zoom out: O key or DF key on the SureType keyboard
 
✓ Go to the current location: 0 (zero) key

254

You need to have a radio signal to download maps to your BlackBerry. In 
addition, we recommend that you have an unlimited data plan if you are a 
frequent user of the GPS feature on your BlackBerry.
TeleNav GPS Navigator
TeleNav GPS Navigator is a full-featured GPS solution. It’s meant as a GPS 
device replacement, which means the folks at TeleNav want you to use your 
BlackBerry in the car. TeleNav’s feature list is extensive. From 3-D maps to a 
real-time compass to finding Wi-Fi hotspots, the list goes on and on. It even 
lets you input the address by speaking aloud instead of typing and responds 
by speaking the directions back to you. Figure 13-5 shows the main menu for 
TeleNav. (Note that there is a network branded version of TeleNav; for exam-
ple, Figure 13-5 shows an AT&T version. The functionalities from TeleNav are 
the same, regardless of network branding.)

255
 Chapter 13: Getting Around with Your BlackBerry GPS
The extensive features come at a price. Depending on your network carrier, 
TeleNav costs about $10 a month. TeleNav does offer a 30-day free trial. Visit 
www.telenav.com for more information. After the product is downloaded, 
an icon appears on your screen (refer to Figure 13-1).
Garmin Mobile
Like TeleNav, Garmin also offers a full-featured GPS solution. It costs a one-time 
fee of $99 (US dollars) and is good for the life of the device. The features of 
Garmin Mobile are very similar to its GPS counterpart. If you have ever owned 
a Garmin GPS, the user interface is very similar and friendly. Figure 13-6 shows 
the main menu for Garmin Mobile.
 
Figure 13-6: 
Garmin 
Mobile’s

We like the simplicity of the Garmin’s user interface and its simple one-time 
cost, so we recommend the Garmin Mobile.

▶ Other must-haves
I
f you think back to the beginning of BlackBerry in 2001, a BlackBerry 
smartphone’s main purpose for existence was communication. Voice 
and e-mail were its strong points. Yes, even back then you could organize 
your life with the built-in calendar, address book, and other PIM functions. 
However, two factors changed the applications that were being built on the 
BlackBerry: an increase in network speed and the iPhone. Ever since iPhone 
3G came on the scene with its App Store, the mobile applications landscape 
has been changed forever.
What does that mean to you as a BlackBerry user? It means great, creative appli-
cations that better your BlackBerry experience. For example, as any veteran 
BlackBerry user can tell you, when you get an e-mail on the BlackBerry, you 
see a little red asterisk indicating that you have a message (SMS/e-mail/PIN). 
However, you can’t preview the message or even tell who it is from until you 
actually go to the Message application (see Chapter 7) and check your e-mail. 
Then came along a little application called PeeKaWho Email/SMS Alert, which 
allows you to preview the person who is texting or e-mailing you and allows 
you to dismiss the pop-up, mark as read, or delete. Simple and to the point. 
It’s applications like this that make the BlackBerry experience even better.
In this chapter, we not only tell you where to get applications like PeeKaWho 
Email/SMS Alert but also point out their useful features and provide a little 
mini–user guide of how to use them.
PeeKaWho Email and SMS Alert
Not only does PeeKaWho show e-mail and SMS alerts (shown in Figure 14-1), 
but it also does spam blocking! That’s right, you can set up filters to mark 

258
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Online with Your BlackBerry 
e-mail addresses as blacklist or whitelist, as shown in Figure 14-2. Did we 
mention you can even use PeeKaWho as a flashlight in dark places?

BlackBerry Facebook Application
If you are not a Facebook user, you ought to try it. Facebook is one of many 
social networking applications that focus on connecting you with your friends 
and family. With Facebook, you can share photos and events with your 
friends. You can post messages for your friends about what you are up to, as 

259
 Chapter 14: Lifestyle Applications
shown in Figures 14-3 and 14-4. With your BlackBerry in hand, you can do all 
this while on the go.

SmrtGuard, Your BlackBerry Guardian
BlackBerry guardian? How does it do that? From the maker of PeeKaWho 
comes SmrtGuard (pronounced smart guard), an application that backs up 
your contacts, call history, calendar, and more, as shown in Figure 14-10.
 
Figure 14-10: 
SmrtGuard

applica-
tion ready 
to back up 
your

data.
 
But it doesn’t stop there. SmrtGuard also has a one-button push to “detonate” 
your BlackBerry in case you lose it. How do you know whether you lost your 
BlackBerry or just simply misplaced it? With its BlackBerry tracker, you can 
see whether someone has stolen it or whether it is lying around your house. 
When you know where it is, you can “audio-ping” your BlackBerry to locate it 
or detonate it.
How does it work? This application has two parts — one part is the SmrtGuard 
BlackBerry application that installed on your BlackBerry; the second part is the 
SmrtGuard Web site with Google Maps that shows you where your BlackBerry 
is located, as shown in Figure 14-11. You can also view the backed-up data 
that’s available for exporting.
SmrtGuard is also useful when you switch to a new BlackBerry device. Just 
go to the SmrtGuard Web site and switch your BlackBerry PIN. After activat-
ing the SmrtGuard software on your new BlackBerry device, you’re ready to 
restore contacts and other PIMs.
To find out more, go to www.smrtguard.com.
E*TRADE for BlackBerry
Ever get an inspiration for a stock trade when you’re not at your desk? Yes,

Syncing the Synchronize Way
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing BlackBerry Desktop Manager
▶ Preparing your PC for PIM synchronization
▶ Using manual and automatic synchronization
W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry updated than to synchronize 
it with your desktop application’s data?
Arguably, most of the data you need to synchronize is from your personal 
information manager (PIM) applications: notes, appointments, addresses, and 
tasks. The crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device and 
desktop computer is Synchronize. This software within BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager allows you to synchronize your PIM data as well as upload and 
download media files between your PC and BlackBerry.
In this chapter, we introduce Synchronize. We show you how to manually 
and automatically synchronize your BlackBerry with your desktop computer. 
We also offer tips about which options you might want to use. Before we get 
into all that, however, we include a section on BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
 
If you’re using a corporate BlackBerry that’s running under BES, you may skip 
this chapter. BlackBerry smartphones running under BES synchronize over 
the air (OTA) or wirelessly.

The centerpiece of your desktop activities on the BlackBerry is BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager (BDM), which is a suite of programs that include the following:
 
✓ Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and updates the 
BlackBerry OS.

268
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
✓ Backup and Restore: Backs up your BlackBerry data and settings. Check 
out Chapter 18 for details.
 
✓ Synchronize: Synchronizes BlackBerry data to your PC (the topic of 
this chapter).
 
✓ Media Manager: Uploads media files to your BlackBerry from your PC 
and vice versa (another topic in this chapter).
 
✓ Device Switch Wizard: Helps you transfer data from your existing 
mobile device to your BlackBerry. See Chapter 16 for details.
BDM is the software that’s on the CD that comes with your handheld device. 
Your BlackBerry’s packaging provides instructions on how to install BDM 
on your desktop computer. For corporate users, check with your BlackBerry 
system administrator for more details.
Installing BDM and Desktop Redirector
The CD that comes with your BlackBerry allows you to install BDM on your 
computer. At the same time, you can install Desktop Redirector. When you 
insert the CD, the installation wizard automatically runs. Follow the wizard. 
One of the screens in the wizard allows you to choose whether this installa-
tion is for personal or for work e-mail. Choosing for work actually allows you 
to use Desktop Redirector for both personal and work.
Desktop Redirector allows you to redirect e-mail that you receive in Outlook. 
This means that even if you get your e-mails through Outlook, you can have 
those e-mails redirected to your BlackBerry.
 
If you’re not using a corporate BES and you want to redirect your Outlook 
e-mail to your BlackBerry, when you’re installing BDM, make sure that you 
select the Redirect Messages Using the BlackBerry Desktop Redirector radio 
button on the installation screen, as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
If your BlackBerry is running under a corporate BES, your e-mail is already 
redirected to your smartphone wirelessly and choosing the BlackBerry 
Desktop Redirector could really mess things up. So don’t do it!
Launching BDM
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BDM through 
your computer’s Start menu. Follow these steps to launch BDM:
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.

269
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
Figure 15-1: 
Configure 
the BDM 
installation 
to include 
Desktop 
Redirector.
 
 
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your computer using the USB cable that 
came with your device.
 
 If your BlackBerry has a microSD card in it when you connect it to your 
PC, your BlackBerry screen displays a prompt for enabling mass storage 
mode. It also asks for your BlackBerry password when you answer Yes 
to the prompt. If you answer Yes to the prompt and type in the pass-
word, your BlackBerry will behave like a flash drive. A drive letter will be 
added to My Computer in Windows Explorer, allowing you to treat the 
microSD card as a normal flash drive.
 
3. Launch BDM.
 
 The BDM opening screen appears; see Figure 15-2.
 
Figure 15-2: 
BlackBerry 
Desktop 
Manager.
 

270
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
BDM installation can vary from phone provider to provider. You should see 
at least the following four icons, or applications:
 
✓ Application Loader (see Chapter 19)
 
✓ Backup and Restore (see Chapter 18)
 
✓ Media (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ Synchronize
Connecting BDM to your BlackBerry
You establish a connection between your BlackBerry and BDM through the 
USB cable that comes with your device. Plug in your device to your desktop. 
After BDM is running, it tries to find a BlackBerry on the type of connection 
specified. The default connection is USB, so you shouldn’t need to configure 
anything.
 
If you have more than one BlackBerry, it’s advisable to distinguish between your 
smartphones in BDM by knowing the BlackBerry PIN. Chapter 8 shows you 
how to do this.
Follow these steps to connect your BlackBerry to BDM:
 
1. Plug in your device to your desktop.
 
2. Launch BDM.
 
 When BDM is running, it tries to find a BlackBerry on a USB connection.
 
3. If your device has a password, BDM prompts you for the password.
 
4. Enter the password.
 
 You see Connected as the screen heading. If for some reason, you see 
Disconnected and no password prompt, one of the following is 
happening:
 
• BDM can’t find the device being connected via the USB cable.
 
• The connection setting isn’t set to use USB.
 
5. Choose Options➪Connection Options at the right side of the BDM 
screen.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 15-3 appears. Make sure that the connection 
setting uses USB.
 
6. In the Connection Type drop-down list, select the USB connection with 
your BlackBerry’s PIN.

Running BDM for the first time
If you’re running BDM for the first time, the program does these things:
 
✓ Tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, which includes 
security encryption setup. It asks you to randomly move your mouse to 
generate security encryption keys.
 
✓ Checks what applications you have on your device and what required 
applications need to be installed. If it can’t find a required application on 
your device, it prompts you to install it. Of course, you have the option 
to cancel and install later.
 
✓ Looks at the settings you have for your Synchronize software. If auto-
synchronization is turned on, BDM attempts to run synchronization for 
your PIM. This is discussed in the section “Automatic synchronization,” 
later in this chapter.
Setting Up Synchronize
Synchronize is the part of BDM that allows you to synchronize your data 
between your desktop computer and your BlackBerry. (If your BlackBerry is 
running on BES, your data is already synced wirelessly, so you don’t need your 
desktop for synchronization.) Synchronize is one of the icons on the BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager screen. To launch Synchronize, simply double-click the 
Synchronize icon. A screen like the one shown in Figure 15-4 appears.
The Synchronize screen is divided into two sections, which you can navigate 
through the links on the left:
 
✓ Synchronize is the default view and allows you to manually trigger syn-
chronization. See Figure 15-4. See the “Using on-demand synchronization” 
and “Automatic synchronization” sections, later in this chapter, for more 
details and for when you use this screen.

272
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
✓ Configuration is where you can set up configuration and rules for 
reconciling data. Under the Configuration link are two subsections, 
Synchronization and Add-ins. These further organize the interface. See 
Figure 15-5. The first thing you need to work with is the Synchronization 
Configuration screen. The following section helps you do that.
 
Figure 15-4: 
The 
Synchronize 
screen.

Configuring PIM synchronization
Notice this important item in the Synchronization Configuration subsection, 
as shown in Figure 15-5: the Synchronization button. You use that button to 
configure PIM (personal information manager) synchronization.

273
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Clicking the Synchronization button displays the screen shown in Figure 15-6. 
You can see that names correspond to the BlackBerry applications except for 
Contacts, which goes by Address Book. This is the entry point of the entire 
synchronization configuration for PIM applications. Selecting the application 
on this screen allows you to pair the PIM handheld application to a desktop 
application (most likely Outlook).
 
Figure 15-6: 
The PIM 
configura-
tion screen.
 
The PIM configuration screen allows you to select which application data you 
want to sync with your Blackberry. The following popular PIM applications 
can be synced to your BlackBerry: ACT!, ASCII Text File Converter, Lotus 
Notes, Lotus Organizer, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and 
Microsoft Schedule.
Here are the four types of application data that can be synchronized to your 
Blackberry:
 
✓ Calendar can be selected if you want to synchronize your appointments 
and events stored in your favorite PIM application.
 
✓ MemoPad can be selected if you want to synchronize any notes or text 
that you may have been storing in your PIM application.
 
✓ Address Book can be selected if you want to synchronize any contact 
information with your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Tasks can be selected if you want to synchronize your to-do list.

274
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Follow these steps to set up your device’s synchronization:
 
1. Connect your BlackBerry to BDM.
 
2. Click the Synchronize icon.
 
3. Click the Synchronization link. (It’s under the Configuration link on 
the left side of the screen.)
 
 In the Synchronization Configuration section, you see a Configure 
Synchronization Settings for My Desktop Program label. Click the 
Synchronization button beside this label, and the PIM configuration 
screen is displayed.
 
4. Select the check box next to an application data type (such as Calendar, 
MemoPad, Address Book, or Tasks) that you want to synchronize.
 
 For example, we selected the Calendar application data type and clicked 
the Setup button. This opens Calendar Setup screen.
 
5. Select a PIM application to retrieve application data from by 
highlighting your desired application.
 
 BDM pulls your selected application data from the application selected 
from this screen (in Figure 15-7, we selected Microsoft Outlook). This 
means that when you synchronize your BlackBerry, the BDM retrieves 
Calendar data from Microsoft Outlook.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Synchronization Options screen appears (see Figure 15-8).
 
Figure 15-7: 
Choose the 
desktop 
application 
here.

nization 
follows 
here.
 
 
7. On the Synchronization Options screen, select which direction the 
synchronization will follow.
 
 Here are the three available synchronization options:
 
• Two Way Sync allows you to synchronize changes both in your 
BlackBerry and in your desktop application.
 
• One Way Sync from Device synchronizes only the changes made 
to your BlackBerry. Changes to your desktop application aren’t 
reflected in your Blackberry.
 
• One Way Sync to Device synchronizes changes made in your 
desktop application to your BlackBerry. Any changes made in 
your BlackBerry aren’t reflected in your desktop application.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
 The Options screen opens for the PIM application you selected in Step 5. 
Figure 15-9 shows the Microsoft Outlook Options screen.
 
 For synchronization to Microsoft Outlook, make sure that you’re selecting 
the correct user profile in the Outlook User Profile drop-down list. This is 
particularly pertinent in cases where you have multiple user profiles in 
your computer. Choosing the wrong one may result in you putting the 
wrong data into your BlackBerry.
 
 The amount of data that is reconciled or synchronized in a given appli-
cation can also be controlled. For example, as shown in Figure 15-9, 
the center portion of the configuration allows you to specify whether 
to transfer all Calendar items, transfer just a set of appointments in the 
future, or transfer items within a range of dates you enter.

 Select the Remove Alarm for Past Items check box if you don’t want to 
keep the alarm setting for events that have already occurred.
 
9. Click the Next button, and then click the Finish button.
 
 Clicking the Next button brings you to the Calendar Setup Finish 
screen. You can just click the Finish button to complete configuring the 
Calendar synchronization you’ve selected.
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Synchronize is intelligent enough to know what 
information, such as names, phone numbers, and addresses in Contacts, 
corresponds to Outlook. This specific bit of information or attributes are 
referred to as a field. For instance, the value of a home phone number field in 
Contacts needs to be mapped to the corresponding field in Outlook so that 
information is transferred correctly.
But not all fields on the desktop side exist on the handheld (and vice versa). 
For example, a Nick Name field doesn’t exist in the BlackBerry Contacts but is 
available in Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some instances, Synchronize 
provides an alternate field and lets you decide whether to map it.
If you ever find the need to change the default mapping, you can. The inter-
face is the same for all PIM applications. To illustrate how to map and unmap 
fields, we use Contacts.

277
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
The following steps lead you to the screen that allows you to map the fields 
for Contacts:
 
1. From BDM, click the Synchronize link.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears.
 
2. Click the Synchronization link. (It’s under the Configuration link on 
the left side of the screen.)
 
3. Click the Synchronize button.
 
 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 15-6).
 
4. Select the Address Book check box.
 
 The Advanced button is enabled.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced screen opens, as shown in Figure 15-10.
 
Figure 15-10:

278
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
6. Click the Map Fields button.
 
 The Map Fields screen for the Address Book/Contacts application 
appears; see Figure 15-11. To map or unmap, click the arrow icons.
 
 If you’re not careful, you can inadvertently unclick a mapping such as 
Job Title, and suddenly your titles aren’t in sync. Double-check your 
mapping before you click the OK button. If you think you made a mis-
take, you can click the Cancel button to save yourself from having to 
restore settings.
 
7. Click the OK button to save your changes.

Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization is not a very interesting task, 
and few people perform it on a regular basis.
You can tell Synchronize to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to make 
(or perhaps undo) on either side of the wire. The Advanced screen comes in 
here. To get to this view, follow these steps:
 
1. From BDM, click the Synchronize link.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears.
 
2. Click the Synchronization link. (It’s under the Configuration link on 
the left side of the screen.)
 
3. Click the Synchronize button.
 
 The PIM configuration screen appears; refer to Figure 15-6.

279
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
4. Select the Address Book check box.
 
 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that 
application from the list.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced screen for Address Book screen appears; refer to Figure 
15-10. This screen has a Confirmations section and gives you two 
options:
 
• Confirm Record Deletions (Recommended)
 
• Confirm Changes and Additions (Recommended)
 
 Regardless of whether you select the first option, Synchronize displays a 
prompt if it detects that it’s about to delete all records.
Resolving update conflicts
Synchronize needs to know how you want to handle any conflicts between 
your BlackBerry and your desktop application. A conflict normally happens 
when the same record is updated in the BlackBerry and also in Outlook. 
For instance, you change Jane Doe’s mobile number in BlackBerry and also 
change her mobile number in Outlook. Where you resolve these conflicts is 
the same for all PIM applications. Again, for illustration, we use Address Book 
as an example:
 
1. From BDM, click the Synchronize link.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears.
 
2. Click the Synchronization link. (It’s under the Configuration link on 
the left side of the screen.)
 
3. Click the Synchronize button.
 
 The PIM configuration screen appears; refer to Figure 15-6.
 
4. Select the Address Book check box.
 
 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that appli-
cation from the list.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced screen for Address Book appears; refer to Figure 15-10. 
This screen has five sections, and the third section is Conflict Resolution.
 
6. Click the Conflict Resolution button.
 
 The Conflict Resolution screen is shown in Figure 15-12.

280
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 15-12: 
Manage 
conflicts 
here.
 
 
 You can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts in a few ways. Here are the 
options shown in the Conflict Resolution - Address Book dialog box:
 
• Add All Conflicting Items: When a conflict happens, add a new 
record to the BlackBerry for the changes on the desktop and add a 
new record to the desktop for the changes on the BlackBerry.
 
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Ignores the change and keeps the data 
the same on both sides.
 
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This option is the safest. Synchronize 
displays the details of the conflict and lets you resolve it.
 
• Device Wins: Unless you’re sure this is the case, you shouldn’t 
choose this option. It tells Synchronize to disregard the changes in 
the desktop and use handheld changes every time it encounters a 
conflict.
 
• Microsoft Outlook Wins: If you’re not using MS Outlook, this option 
is based on your application. This option tells Synchronize to 
always discard changes on the handheld and use the desktop 
application change whenever it encounters a conflict. Again, we 
don’t recommend this option because there’s no telling on which 
side you made the good update.
 
7. Select the option you want.
 
8. Click the OK to save the settings.
Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Earlier in this chapter, we show you how to 
define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now it’s 
time to be brave and push the button. You can synchronize one of two ways:
 
✓ Manually (by clicking the Synchronize Now icon)
 
✓ Automatically (by choosing How Often on the calendar)

281
 Chapter 15: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Using on-demand synchronization
This portion of Synchronize is a feature that lets you run synchronization 
manually. Remember that even if you set up automatic synchronization, 
actual synchronization doesn’t happen right away. So, if you made updates 
to your appointments in Outlook while your BlackBerry is connected to your 
PC, this feature allows you to be sure that your updates made it to your 
BlackBerry before heading out the door.
Without delay, here are the steps:
 
1. From BDM, click the Synchronize link.
 
 The Synchronize screen appears; refer to Figure 15-4. The following four 
check boxes let you be selective:
 
• Reconcile Messages: This option synchronizes your e-mails 
between Outlook and your smartphone.
 
• Synchronize Organizer Data: Includes notes, appointments, 
addresses, and tasks.
 
• Run Add-in Actions: This option comes into play when you have 
third-party applications that require data synchronization between 
your PC and your BlackBerry.
 
• Update Device Date and Time: You only need this if you want both 
the PC and BlackBerry to have the same time. This ensures that 
you’re reminded of your appointments at same time for both 
Outlook and the BlackBerry.
 
2. Select the check boxes for the data you want to have synchronized.
 
3. Click the Synchronize button.
 
 Synchronize starts running the synchronization, and you see a progress 
screen. If you set up prompts for conflicts and Synchronize encounters 
one, a screen appears so that you can resolve it. When finished, the 
progress screen disappears and the Synchronize screen reappears.
 
 If you’ve turned on automatic synchronization (see the next section), 
the items you select in Step 2 automatically sync every time you connect 
your BlackBerry to your PC.
 
4. Click the Close button.
Automatic synchronization
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize setup? 
Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. And if you’re like us, the 

282
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run 
Synchronize. So, opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize button is 
somewhat annoying.
 
To make Synchronize run automatically every time you connect your 
BlackBerry to your PC, simply make sure that you select the last check box 
on the Synchronize screen (refer to Figure 15-4) — Synchronize the Selected 
Items When Your Device Is Connected to the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
You might be asking, “What items will autosynchronization sync?” Good 
question. Synchronize automatically syncs the items you selected in the top 
portion of the Synchronize screen (refer to Figure 15-4). Note that if you make 
a change, selecting or deselecting an item on the Synchronize screen, only 
the selected items will be automatically synced the next time you connect 
your BlackBerry to your PC.

ouldn’t it be nice if you could just make one device’s data available to 
another? That’s the future. But right now, RIM wants to make switching 
devices as painless as possible. That’s why an application called Device Switch 
Wizard is part of the suite of applications in BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
Switching to a New BlackBerry
Switching from an older BlackBerry to your new BlackBerry is no big deal. 
When you want to transfer application data (e-mails and contacts, for 
example) to your new BlackBerry, the BlackBerry Desktop Manager’s Device 
Switch Wizard backs up your old BlackBerry and loads that backup to your 
new device.
The following steps help you transition from your old device to your new 
BlackBerry smartphone:
 
1. On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
 
 The Desktop Manager screen opens, where you can find Device Switch 
Wizard, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
2. Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
 
 The Device Switch Wizard screen lets you choose whether to switch 
from BlackBerry to BlackBerry or from non-BlackBerry to BlackBerry. 
The BlackBerry to BlackBerry section tells you to connect your current 
(old) BlackBerry to your PC.
 
3. Connect your old BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable.

4. Click the Start button below Switch BlackBerry Devices.
 
 The next screen lets you verify the PINs for both devices, the old Black
Berry on the left and your new BlackBerry on the right, as shown in 
Figure 16-2. Because you only connected your old BlackBerry, it should 
be preselected.
 
 Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a password, but your BlackBerry smartphone 
identifier. You can find the PIN by going to Options➪Status on your 
BlackBerry.

285
 Chapter 16: Switching Devices
 
5. Decide whether to include user data and third-party applications and 
click the Next button.
 
 If you want all the data, leave the screen untouched; this backs up every-
thing. Third-party applications are all the programs you installed — the 
ones that didn’t come with the device originally.
 
 A status screen appears, showing the progress of the backup operation. 
When the backup is finished, the next screen prompts you for the PIN of 
your new BlackBerry.
 
6. Connect your new BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable.
 
 The next screen, shown in Figure 16-3, lets you verify that your 
BlackBerry is connected properly with the PIN displayed. It also asks 
you for the password.
 
Figure 16-3:

7. Enter the password of your BlackBerry and click the OK button.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 16-4 tells you what will be restored to the new 
device. Nothing has been done to your new BlackBerry yet, and this is 
your last chance to cancel the process.

9. When the Success screen appears, click the Close button.
Switching from a Non-BlackBerry Device
Device Switch Wizard supports two types of non-BlackBerry devices:
 
✓ Palm
 
✓ Microsoft Windows Mobile
This doesn’t mean that you can’t import your old data if you have another 
device. The Device Switch Wizard just makes it simpler for these two types 
of devices. Check out Chapter 15 for synchronization options to your Desktop 
PIM application if your old device is neither Palm nor Microsoft Windows 
Mobile.
Palm device requirements
Your equipment has to meet three prerequisites for Device Switch Wizard to 
import data from Palm to BlackBerry:
 
✓ Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 
✓ One of the following Palm Desktop Software versions must be installed 
on your desktop:
 
• 4.0.1
 
• 4.1
 
• 4.1.4
 
• 6.0.1
 
✓ The Palm Desktop Software installed is synchronizing properly with the 
Palm device.
You can check your Palm user guide for more details about your Palm device 
and on synchronizing it to your PC. You can also download the user guide 
from www.palm.com/us/support/index.hml. Navigate to this page by 
selecting the Palm model you have and the wireless network provider it is 
running on.

287
 Chapter 16: Switching Devices
Windows Mobile device requirements
You need the following things for the wizard to work properly with a 
Windows Mobile device:
 
✓ Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 
✓ Microsoft ActiveSync versions must be installed on your PC.
 
✓ The Mobile device must run one of the following operating systems:
 
• Microsoft Windows Mobile 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003SE, or 2005/5.0 for 
Pocket PC
 
• Microsoft Windows Mobile SmartPhone software 2002, 2003, or 
2003 SE
Running the wizard
Before you run the wizard, make sure that all the requirements for your device 
are in place. We also recommend hot-syncing or synchronizing your Palm 
or Windows Mobile device; this ensures that the data you’re sending to 
your BlackBerry is current. Palm Desktop Software as well as the Microsoft 
ActiveSync should come with help information on how to hot-sync.
Although the following steps migrate Windows Mobile data into the 
BlackBerry, the steps are similar for Palm as well. We indicate at what point 
the steps vary. Do the following to get your other device’s data migrated to 
your new BlackBerry:
 
1. Connect both the Windows Mobile device and the BlackBerry to your 
desktop computer.
 
2. On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
 
 The Desktop Manager screen appears; refer to Figure 16-1.
 
3. Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
 
 The Device Switch Wizard screen appears.
 
4. Click the image next to Switch from another Device to BlackBerry 
Device.
 
 The welcome screen, as shown in Figure 16-5, describes what the tool 
can do.

data from 
a non-
BlackBerry 
device.
 
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 A screen prompts you to decide whether you’re migrating from Palm 
or Windows Mobile, as shown in Figure 16-6. The wizard is intelligent 
enough to enable the option associated to the connected device, which 
in the figure is the Windows Mobile device.
 
Figure 16-6: 
The wizard 
has already 
selected 
which 
device 
to port.
 
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 Hot-syncing of the Windows Mobile device kicks in at this point. You see 
a series of screens that appear for each of the application’s data, such 
as Calendar, Contacts, and MemoPad. A sample for the Calendar data 
is shown in Figure 16-7. The screen indicates what to sync and will be 
empty if you already performed a hot-sync prior to running the wizard; 
otherwise, it will take some time depending on how much data it has to 
sync between the device and the desktop software.

289

7. Click the OK button.
 
 A progress screen appears. Before the data is applied to your Black
Berry, the wizard prompts you about the change, as shown in Figure 16-8. 
Click the following buttons on this screen to either confirm or reject the 
change:
 
• Details: Click this if you want to know the records the wizard is 
trying to apply.
 
• Accept: Click this if you just want to have the data migrated.

Chapter 17
Unite! Your BlackBerry
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing BlackBerry Unite!
▶ Installing and configuring BlackBerry Unite!
▶ Sharing calendar entries and downloading files
▶ Restricting phone and Internet usage
I
f this is the first time you’re reading about BlackBerry Unite! and you want 
to find out how to take advantage of it, this is the chapter for you. No, 
BlackBerry Unite! isn’t an activist movement to get President Obama to keep 
his BlackBerry while in the White House. However, it is a way for a house-
hold or small business with multiple BlackBerry users to better collaborate 
and share photos, documents, and files. As a small business owner with five 
or fewer employees, you can collaborate with your employees by sharing 
office documents on the BlackBerry, monitor employee BlackBerry usage for 
Web visits, and even restrict phone and SMS usage. As a busy head of house-
hold, you can share family events, photos, and videos with the other family 
BlackBerry users. Of course, you can also restrict your kid’s texting and 
phone usage with BlackBerry Unite!
In this chapter, we help you set up and master BlackBerry Unite! Whether 
you want to use BlackBerry Unite! to be a Big Brother or the family schedule 
coordinator is up to you.
Getting Started with BlackBerry Unite!
The idea behind BlackBerry Unite! is taking an older PC and turning it, com-
bined with an Internet connection, into a BlackBerry Unite! server. This PC 
needs to be always on and always connected to the Internet for you to use 
BlackBerry Unite! features. Of course, you can also take the PC that you 
currently own and run Unite! on it.
If this sounds like too much trouble for you, feel free to skip the rest of this 
chapter; otherwise, march on, solders!

✓ BlackBerry minimum requirements:
 
• BlackBerry OS 4.3 or higher.
 
• OS 4.0 to OS 4.2.1 is supported with reduced functions.
Where to get it
The easiest way to get BlackBerry Unite! on your PC is to download it from 
BlackBerry’s Web site:
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/blackberryunite
Click the Download tab, and on the page that appears, click the link that cor-
responds to your BlackBerry service provider. If your provider isn’t listed, 
click the Research In Motion link. Fill in the online form that appears and 
follow the prompts to complete your download.
Installing BlackBerry Unite!
After you have downloaded the BlackBerry Unite! software from BlackBerry’s 
Web site, double-click the Installation icon.
The installation process asks you a few questions, such as where on your PC 
you want the BlackBerry Unite! installation file to reside and which country you 

293
 Chapter 17: Unite! Your BlackBerry
reside in. The questions are all very standard in terms of software 
installation.
The following sections show you how to configure BlackBerry Unite! after you 
finish installation.
Registering and opening Unite!
When the installation is finished and you launch the Web Admin Console for 
the first time, you’re prompted to register the product, as shown in Figure 17-1.
 
Figure 17-1: 
Register 
BlackBerry 
Unite! 
within the 
Web Admin 
Console.
 
Enter your name in the First Name and Last Name text boxes. Enter your 
e-mail address in the Email Address text box. Select your country of resi-
dence from the Country drop-down list, and finally, type the letters and num-
bers you see in the box.
After you register, plug in your BlackBerry via USB to your PC.
 
You can also start the BlackBerry Unite! Web Admin Console on your PC by 
choosing Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry Unite!➪BlackBerry Unite! Web Admin.

294
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Adding BlackBerry users
From the Welcome screen shown in Figure 17-2, you add a new user by click-
ing the aptly named Add a New User button. If you’re adding a new user later 
on, click the Users link on the left side of the screen, and then click the Add a 
New User button.
When you click the Add a New User button to add a new BlackBerry user 
from your small business or your family to BlackBerry Unite!, the first thing it 
prompts you to set up is e-mail. (This is quite straightforward and similar to 
setting up e-mail as described in Chapter 7.) All you need to do is enter your 
e-mail address and password, and BlackBerry Unite! does the rest.
 
When registering e-mail on Unite! don’t register an e-mail address that you’ve 
already registered with the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS — see Chapter 7 
for how to register e-mail accounts). Or, if you want to use the same address, 
first unregister the e-mail address from BIS. Why? If you have the same e-mail 
address registered on both BIS and Unite! you get all e-mail messages twice. 
You don’t want that.
If you don’t want to add an e-mail address to Unite! when you are adding a 
user, simply don’t enter an e-mail address and password. Or, if you have 
already set up the e-mail, you can simply delete the e-mail account, but the 
BlackBerry user will still be registered with BlackBerry Unite!

 Chapter 17: Unite! Your BlackBerry
After you have added a user to BlackBerry Unite! you will see a few Unite! 
icons on the BlackBerry device of the registered user. In Figure 17-3, you can 
see three icons that relate to BlackBerry Unite! Ignore the first icon on the 
left, because it directs you back to the Home screen. The second icon from 
the left is the Download Manager, where you can browse and download files 
right from your PC to your BlackBerry. The third icon from the left is the 
Remote Device Management icon. The fourth icon corresponds to the e-mail 
account that you set up on Unite!. Note that this icon appears only if you 
setup your e-mail via Unite!.

your Home 
screen.
 
Sharing Calendar Events 
on BlackBerry Unite!
Sharing a calendar event on BlackBerry Unite! is easy. From the Web Admin 
Console, click the Shared Calendar link. Click the Add Event button and fill in 
the event details, as shown in Figure 17-4. The information is similar to what 
you enter in your BlackBerry, as described in Chapter 5.
As soon as you click the Save button, all your BlackBerry Unite! registered 
BlackBerry smartphones will have the event automatically synced. The event 
appears as a Calendar entry, as shown in Figure 17-5.

As we indicate in Chapter 5, you can pick different colors for different Calendar 
services on your BlackBerry. For example, in Figure 17-5, the BlackBerry Unite! 
Calendar service is colored yellow (though it looks light gray in this black-and-
white book).
Downloading and Syncing Files
With BlackBerry Unite! you can download files stored on your PC to your 
BlackBerry remotely, meaning that you can download files from almost any-
where. You can also connect your BlackBerry to the PC (via a USB cable) and 
automatically sync new files stored on the PC. The following sections show 
you how.
Downloading files remotely 
with Download Manager
One of the great things that BlackBerry Unite! allows you to do is remotely 
access the files on your home or office network. After you have set up Black
Berry Unite! on your PC and have registered your BlackBerry with BlackBerry 
Unite! you see an icon called Download Manager on your BlackBerry Home 
screen (refer to Figure 17-3).
To download a file from your PC, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the Download Manager icon and press the trackball.
 
 This opens the Download Manager application, as shown in Figure 17-6.
 
2. Highlight Browse Remote Files and press the trackball.
 
 This opens the shared folder on your PC, as shown in Figure 17-7.

297
 Chapter 17: Unite! Your BlackBerry
 
Figure 17-6: 
Download 
Manager 
allows you 
to browse 
and down-
load files.
 
 
3. Select a file and choose Download File from the menu.
 
 This starts the file download.
 
Figure 17-7: 
Files on 
your PC, 
ready for 
download.
 
You can always check on the progress of the file download in Download 
Manager, which shows the file you’re downloading and its progress.
 
We recommend remotely downloading files that are less than 5MB using the 
Download Manager from your BlackBerry. Files such as documents and photos 
are great examples. But if you need to get larger files onto your BlackBerry (say 
a video clip), we recommend using Folder Sync (see the next section).
Syncing files with Folder Sync
Another way to get files from your PC to your BlackBerry is through Folder 
Sync from BlackBerry Unite! However, this can only be done if you connect 
your BlackBerry to your PC via a USB cable.

298
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
You might be thinking, “Why would I go through the effort of plugging my 
BlackBerry to my PC if I can get files remotely?” Well, it’s faster to download 
large files using a USB cable than it is to download them remotely. Also, as 
you download remotely over the air, beware of the impact of downloading 
may have on your data plan. If you have an unlimited data plan, then you’re 
all set. However, if you have a data transfer limit on your account, you might 
be hit with a larger than expected bill if you have many files that get synced 
automatically.
Folder Sync is great for transferring media files such as music, video clips, 
and photos. For instance, you can set up a folder in which you store family 
photos with BlackBerry Unite! and every time you plug in your BlackBerry to 
your PC that has BlackBerry Unite! installed, any new photos will be automat-
ically synced to your BlackBerry for viewing. Note that this is a one-way sync 
from PC to BlackBerry, and doesn’t work the other way around.
To set up Folder Sync, follow these steps:
 
1. From your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry Unite!➪
BlackBerry Unite! Web Admin.
 
2. On the BlackBerry Unite! Admin page, select a registered 
BlackBerry user.
 
3. From the left navigation bar, click Folder Management.
 
4. Click the Add Folder button.
 
5. Select a folder on your PC that you want to sync with your BlackBerry.
 
 You see the name of the folder that you just added on-screen.
What we recommend is to remotely get files that are less than 5 MB using 
the remote Download Manager from your BlackBerry. Files like documents, 
photos are great examples. 
Restricting and Monitoring 
BlackBerry Usage
As we mention earlier in this chapter, with BlackBerry Unite! you can restrict 
a registered BlackBerry user from using SMS or from viewing an attachment.
You can do all this from Device Management by following these steps:
 
1. From your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry Unite!➪ 
BlackBerry Unite! Web Admin.

299
 Chapter 17: Unite! Your BlackBerry
 
2. On the BlackBerry Unite! Admin page, select a registered BlackBerry 
user.
 
3. From the left navigation bar, click Device Management.
 
 You see the Device Management screen, as shown in Figure 17-8.
 
4. Click the Manage Services tab.
 
5. You can restrict phone usage or Internet usage (or both):
 
• If you want to restrict phone usage, make sure that the Phone check 
box is selected and click the Restrict Phone Usage button. A screen 
will then prompt you to allow/disallow following:
 
• Allow Outgoing Calls: Enable this option to allow all outgoing calls.
 
• Allow Calls To: This is a white list of numbers or area codes that 
this particular BlackBerry can make calls to.
 
• Allow Incoming Calls: Enable this option to allow all incoming calls.
 
• Allow Calls From: This is a white list of numbers or area codes that 
this particular BlackBerry can receive.
 
• If you want to restrict Internet usage, make sure that the Internet 
Browsing check box is selected, and then click the Restrict Internet 
Browsing button. A screen then prompts you to configure and set 
permission for Web sites for a Unite! registered BlackBerry:
 
• Allow This Web Site: This is a white list of Web sites that this par-
ticular BlackBerry can visit. You can use * to allow sub-domains. 
For example, enter *.yahoo.com to include movies.yahoo.com 
and mail.yahoo.com.
 
• Deny This Web Site: This is a black list of Web sites that this partic-
ular BlackBerry can not visit. You can use * to allow sub-domains, 
as described in the preceding bullet.

Protecting Your Information
In This Chapter
▶ Performing a full backup of your BlackBerry data
▶ Restoring from backups
▶ Selecting what data to back up
▶ Backing up and restoring wirelessly
I
magine that you left your beautiful BlackBerry in the back of a cab. You’ve 
lost your BlackBerry for good. Okay, not good. What happens to all your 
information? How are you going to replace all those contacts? What about 
security?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information security — if you 
set up a security password on your BlackBerry. With security password pro-
tection on your BlackBerry, anyone who finds your BlackBerry has only ten 
chances to enter the correct password; after those ten chances are up, it’s 
self-destruction time. Although it isn’t as smoky as Mission Impossible, your 
BlackBerry does erase all its information, thwarting your would-be data thief.
 
If you haven’t set up a password for your BlackBerry, do it now! For 
information on how to do so, refer to Chapter 3.
Now, how do you get back all the information that was on your BlackBerry? If 
you’re like us and store important information on your BlackBerry, this chapter 
is for you. Vital information such as clients’ and friends’ contact information, 
notes from phone calls with clients — and, of course, those precious e-mail 
messages — shouldn’t be taken lightly. Backing up this information is a 
reliable way to protect it from being lost forever.
If your BlackBerry is not in a BlackBerry Enterprise Server, BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager is the only way to back up and restore information to and from your 
desktop PC. But in the recent months, SmrtGuard (pronounced smart guard) 
has come up with a wireless backup and restore service for those of you that 
don’t have the habit of plugging your BlackBerry into your PC. If that is you, 
go to the end of this chapter, where we introduce SmrtGuard’s backup and 
restore solution that can give you peace of mind when it comes to protecting 
your data.

302
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM) application. It 
allows you to back up all the sensitive data on your BlackBerry, including con-
tacts, e-mails, memos, to-dos, all personal preferences and options, and more.
For most users, your e-mails are already stored in accounts such as Gmail or 
Yahoo! mail. But you can still back up e-mails just in case.
To back up information on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
1. Open BDM on your PC by choosing Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪
Desktop Manager.
 
 If you haven’t already installed BDM on your PC, see Chapter 15.
 
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable that came 
with your BlackBerry.
 
 If everything is set up right, a pop-up window on your PC asks you to 
type your BlackBerry security password.
 
3. Type your password.
 
 The BlackBerry connects to the PC.
 
4. Double-click the Backup and Restore icon on the BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager screen.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen opens; see Figure 18-1. You’re ready to 
back up data from or restore information to your BlackBerry.
 
Figure 18-1:

and Restore 
screen.

 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
Backing Up, BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace of mind. 
So do the folks at RIM, which is why backing up your information is quite 
easy. You can back up your BlackBerry manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your BlackBerry manually
To back up your BlackBerry on demand, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM screen, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 18-1.
 
2. Click the Backup button.
 
 The dialog box shown in Figure 18-2 appears, so you can name the 
backup file and figure out where on your PC you want to save it.
 
3. Name your backup file and choose a place to save it.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
 BDM starts backing up your BlackBerry information to your PC. Figure 
18-3 shows the backup progress in the Transfer in Progress window.
 
 Don’t unplug your BlackBerry from the PC until the backup is finished! 
Depending on how much information you have on your BlackBerry, the 
backup might take ten minutes to finish.
 
5. When the Transfer in Progress window disappears, unplug the 
BlackBerry from the PC.
 
Figure 18-2: 
Decide 
where to 
save your 
backup file.

Setting up automatic backups
What’s better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back 
up regularly! What’s better than backing up regularly? You guessed it — 
running backups automatically. After you schedule automated BlackBerry 
backups, you can really have peace of mind when it comes to preventing 
information loss.
Follow these steps to set up an autobackup:
 
1. From the BDM screen, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 The Backup Options screen appears, where you can schedule automatic 
backups. See Figure 18-4.
 
3. Select the Back Up My Device Automatically Every check box.
 
 This lets you make more decisions (check boxes and options become 
active), such as how often you want BDM to back up your BlackBerry.
 
4. In the Days field, select a number of days between 1 and 99.
 
 This interval sets how often your BlackBerry is backed up. For example, 
if you enter 14, your BlackBerry is backed up every 14 days.
 
5. Select the Back Up All Device Application Data option.
 
 This option backs up all the data on your BlackBerry each time auto-
backup runs.

305
 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
 
Figure 18-4: 
Set auto-
backups 
here.
 
 
 Although you can exclude e-mail messages and information, such as 
from Contacts, to-dos, and memos, we recommend that you back up 
everything each time.
 
6. Click the OK button.
 
 Now you can go on with your life without worrying when to back up.
 
To run a backup, your BlackBerry must be connected to your PC. Make sure 
that you plug your BlackBerry into your PC once in a while so that autobackup 
has a chance to back up your information.
Restoring Your Data from 
Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once. A full 
restore means bringing back all your information from a backup. It prob-
ably means that you’ve lost information that you had hoped to find from the 
backup you created on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Restore button.
 
 An Open File dialog box asks where the backup file is on your PC.
 
3. Choose a backup file and click the Open button.
 
 A Warning window appears when you’re about to do a full restore (see 
Figure 18-5), alerting you that you’re about to overwrite existing 
information.

306
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
Figure 18-5: 
Be care-
ful when 
overwriting 
existing info.
 
 
4. Click the Yes button to go ahead with the full restore.
 
 A progress bar appears.
 
 It might take a while for the full restore to finish. Don’t unplug your 
BlackBerry from your PC during this time!
 
5. When the progress bar disappears, unplug the device from the PC.
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry both say that you can have it your way 
with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or without all 
the extras (such as pickles and onions), you can choose to not back up and 
restore things that you know you won’t need.
For example, say you’ve accidentally deleted all your Internet bookmarks 
and now you want them back. Don’t restore all the information from your last 
backup. That could be more than 90 days ago (depending on how often your 
autobackup runs, if at all). You might unintentionally overwrite other infor-
mation, such as e-mail or new contacts. You want to restore bookmarks only.
If you lose something in particular, or want something specific back on your 
BlackBerry, use the selective backup and restore function in BDM and restore 
only what you need. The same goes with backing up. If you’re a big e-mail 
user, back up just your e-mails and nothing else.
 
In the following sections, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as 
technical as you think. Think of a database as an information category on the 
BlackBerry. For example, saying, “backing up your Browser bookmarks 

307
 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
database” is just a fancy way of saying, “backing up all your Browser 
bookmarks on your BlackBerry.”
We start with a selective backup and then describe a selective restore.
Backing up, your way
To back up specific information, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears, as shown in Figure 18-6. The 
right side of the screen shows different information categories, or
databases.
 
Figure 18-6:
 The 
advanced 
Backup/
Restore 
screen.
 
 
3. In the Device Databases list on the right, Ctrl+click the databases you 
want to back up.
 
4. Click the left-pointing (backup) arrow.
 
 A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry is backed up. This step 
merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it doesn’t save them. When 
the backup transfer is finished, you can see the databases on the left 
side of the window.
 
5. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 A file chooser appears.

308
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
6. Name your file and specify where you want to save it on your PC.
 
 This saves your selective backup on your PC. Make sure to name it 
something specific so that you know exactly what is in the backup.
 
You need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you choose a 
location for the file in Step 3. A selective backup doesn’t automatically save 
your backup on your PC.
Restoring, your way
When you’re restoring selectively, you must already have a backup file to 
restore from. Although this might sound obvious, the point we’re making is 
that you can selectively restore from any backup — auto or manual.
For example, say you have autobackup running every other day and you want 
to restore only your e-mail messages from two days ago. You don’t need to 
do a full restore; that would overwrite the new contact you put in Contacts 
yesterday. Rather, you can use the selective restore method and get back 
only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
 
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 18-6. The 
right side of the screen shows your different information categories, or 
databases.
Looking at backup BlackBerry files
Whether you use the one-button-push backup 
method or you manually back up your files, 
the files are saved on your PC as .ipd files. 
Those curious readers out there might be 
asking, “Can I read these backup files without 
a BlackBerry?” The answer is yes! With a third-
party product called ABC Amber BlackBerry 
Converter, you can view any .ipd file. What’s 
the point? Suppose you lost your BlackBerry but 
need to read an old e-mail or get contacts from 
your backup files. This tool allows you to con-
vert anything in your backup file (e-mails, SMS 
messages, PIM messages, and contacts) into 
PDF or Word documents. For more information 
and to try ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter 
for free, go to www.processtext.com/
abcblackberry.html.

309
 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
 
3. Choose File➪Open.
 
 A window opens so that you can choose which backup file you want to 
restore from.
 
 A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd suffix.
 
4. Select a backup file.
 
5. Click the Open button.
 
 The different information categories, or databases, appear on the left 
side of the screen. You are now ready for a selective restore.
 
6. Select the database(s) you want to restore.
 
 You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the databases 
you want.
 
7. Click the right-pointing (Restore) arrow.
 
 You see a warning window asking whether you want to replace all the 
information with the data you’re restoring. Refer to Figure 18-5.
 
 If your BlackBerry has the same categories as the ones you’re restoring 
(which is likely), you’ll overwrite any information you have on your 
BlackBerry.
 
 You can confidently move on to Step 8 (clicking the Yes button) if you know 
the database you’re restoring has the information you’re looking for.
 
8. Click the Yes button.
 
 A progress bar appears while the selected databases are being restored. 
When the progress bar window disappears, the information categories 
that you’ve selected are restored on your BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information, 
your way
You can also delete information on your BlackBerry from BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager. When would you use selective deletion?
Suppose you want to clear only your phone logs from your BlackBerry. One 
way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press Delete, repeating 
until all phone logs are gone. However, you could instead delete a database 
from the advanced Backup/Restore screen by using the Backup and Restore 
function.

310
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
 
1. From BDM on your PC, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
 
 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears; refer to Figure 18-6. The 
right side of the screen shows your BlackBerry’s different databases.
 
3. Ctrl+click the database(s) you want to delete.
 
 The database is highlighted.
 
4. Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
 
 A warning window asks you to confirm your deletion.
 
5. Click the Yes button.
 
 A progress bar shows the deletion. When the progress bar disap-
pears, the information categories you selected are cleared from your 
BlackBerry.
Backup and Restore Wirelessly
Yes, that’s right! Your BlackBerry can do this without being on the BES or 
go through the trouble of plugging your BlackBerry to your PC via BDM. 
However, you do have to pay a little bit for this service.
A company called SmrtGuard, www.smrtguard.com, offers software that you 
can install on your BlackBerry that can wirelessly back up your data. Currently, 
SmrtGuard supports backing up Contacts, memos, and to-dos. SmrtGuard 
plans to support calendar, pictures, and phone logs in the near future.
In addition to its backup and restore capabilities, SmrtGuard also has features 
to help you locate, recover, and destroy data on your device. SmrtGuard has 
a BlackBerry tracking, or “LoJack,” feature that helps you determine whether 
you simply misplaced your device or whether your device was stolen. If you 
determine your device was stolen, you can send a signal to have your data 
destroyed via the SmrtGuard Dashboard on the Web site.

Think of your BlackBerry as a mini-laptop where you can run preinstalled 
applications as well as install new applications. You can even upgrade your 
BlackBerry’s operating system. (Yup, that’s right, your BlackBerry has an

We start this chapter by introducing Application Loader, which allows you 
to load applications (who’d have guessed?) onto your BlackBerry. Then we 
show you how to install and uninstall an application from your BlackBerry. 
Finally, we show you how to use Application Loader to upgrade your 
operating system.
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, as with other chapters in Part IV, you work closely with your PC 
and your BlackBerry. On your PC, you use an application called BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager (BDM), which comes on a CD along with your BlackBerry. For 
an introduction to BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see Chapter 15. Application 
Loader is in BlackBerry Desktop Manager.

312
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
After installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, do the following to 
access Application Loader:
 
1. On your PC, select Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
 
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager opens.
 
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your PC via your USB cable.
 
 If the connection is successful, you see the password dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 19-1. If not, see whether the USB cable is connected 
properly to both your PC and your BlackBerry and then try again. If all 
else fails, contact the technical support of your service provider.
 
Figure 19-1: 
The pass-
word dialog 
box on 
your PC.
 
 
3. Enter your password.
 
 Your BlackBerry-to-PC connection is complete.
 
4. On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
 
 The Application Loader screen opens, as shown in Figure 19-2. At this 
point, you’re ready to use the Application Loader.

 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Installing an Application
 
In this chapter, we install iSkoot for Skype for BlackBerry. iSkoot is a free appli-
cation that connects to the Web directly and allows you to use Skype. You can 
download this application at www.download.com/iSkoot-for-Skype-
BlackBerry-/3000-7242_4-10797721.html.
No matter what application you’re installing from your PC to your 
BlackBerry, the steps are the same. So you can use the following steps as a 
guide to installing the application of your choice:
 
1. Install the application on your PC.
 
 The installation onto your PC varies, depending on the application, so 
refer to its manual.
 
2. Locate the application’s ALX file.
 
 You can usually find a file with the .alx extension in the folder where 
you installed the application on your PC.
 
 The ALX file doesn’t get installed on your BlackBerry; rather, it tells 
Application Loader where the actual application file is located on your PC.
 
3. Double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
 
 The Application Loader screen shows. Refer to Figure 19-2.
 
4. Connect your BlackBerry to your PC using the USB cable.
 
 A screen prompting you to enter your BlackBerry password appears.
 
5. Enter your password (refer to Figure 19-1).
 
 After entering your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
 
6. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 The screen listing of what applications to install appears.
 
7. Click the Browse button and locate and select the ALX file you want 
to install.
 
 You return to the Application Loader screen, where iSkoot is one of the 
applications in the list, as shown in Figure 19-3.
 
8. Select the application you want to install (for this example, we select 
iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry) and click the Next button.
 
 A summary screen appears, listing only the applications that will be 
installed or upgraded.

Figure 19-3:
 Your 
application

of installed 
applications 
and can be 
installed 
on your 
BlackBerry.
 
 
9. Click the Finish button.
 
 The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears — and if all went well — the application is 
on your BlackBerry. The application should be in the Applications folder 
of your BlackBerry.
If you get an invalid signature error after clicking the Finish button:
 
✓ You didn’t get your BlackBerry from your employer: Something is 
probably wrong with the application. You need to contact the software 
vendor.
 
✓ You got your BlackBerry from your employer: You don’t have permis-
sion to install applications on your BlackBerry. The IT department rules 
the school.
 
You don’t have to use Application Loader to get the goods onto your 
BlackBerry. You can install applications other ways as well:
 
✓ Wirelessly through an over-the-air (OTA) download. See Chapter 9 for 
more on wireless installations.
 
✓ BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) wireless install (if your BlackBerry is 
employer provided). In this case, you have no control over the installa-
tion process. Your company’s BlackBerry system administrator controls 
which applications are on your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Through the PC via Microsoft Installer. Some application installations 
automate the steps described above. All you need to do is connect your 
BlackBerry to the PC and double-click the installation file. Applications 
installation using the Microsoft Installer has the file extension .msi.

315
 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in two ways:
 
✓ Using Application Loader
 
✓ Using your BlackBerry handheld
As we did in the preceding section on installing, we use iSkoot as an example 
and assume that you already installed the iSkoot application. Of course, you 
can follow the same steps for uninstalling other applications.
Uninstalling with Application Loader
The steps to uninstalling a BlackBerry application are similar to installing:
 
1. On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
 
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your pc using the USB cable.
 
 A screen prompting you to enter your BlackBerry password appears.
 
3. Enter your password (refer to Figure 19-1).
 
 If your handheld isn’t connected properly, the PIN of your device won’t 
show up in the Application Loader screen. Connect your BlackBerry to 
the USB cable and connect the USB cable to the PC.
 
 After entering your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
 
4. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 The screen listing of applications appears, similar to Figure 19-3.
 
5. Scroll to the application you want to delete and deselect its check box.
 
 For example, when we deselect the iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry check 
box, the Action column for iSkoot indicates Remove.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 A summary screen that lists the action of the Application Loader shows 
up. It indicates that iSkoot is to be removed from your BlackBerry.
 
7. Click the Finish button.
 
 The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears, you have uninstalled the application from 
your BlackBerry.

316
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Uninstalling with your 
BlackBerry handheld
When you don’t have access to your PC, you can uninstall an application 
from your BlackBerry handheld. Follow these steps:
 
 
1. Select the Options icon from the BlackBerry Home screen.
 
 The Options application opens. If you are holding BlackBerry in portrait 
mode, you need to press the Menu key first to make the Options icon 
visible on the Home screen.
 
2. Scroll to Advanced Options and select Applications.
 
 The list of applications installed on your BlackBerry appears, as shown 
in Figure 19-4.
 
3. Scroll to the application you want to delete and press the Menu key.
 
4. Select Delete (see Figure 19-5).
 
 A confirmation dialog box appears.

applications

on your 
BlackBerry.
 
 
Figure 19-5:

application.
 

317
 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
 
5. Select Delete to confirm the deletion.
 
 You’re given a choice to restart now or at a later time. After restarting, 
the deleted application is uninstalled.
 
A much later version of BlackBerry Operating Systems (OS 4.6 and later) 
allows you to uninstall an application right from the Home screen. You can 
quickly check whether your BlackBerry allows you to do this by highlighting 
the Application icon in Home screen and pressing the Menu key. If your 
BlackBerry OS supports this type of uninstall, you see a Delete menu item 
which you can conveniently select.
Upgrading Your BlackBerry OS
Your BlackBerry is RIM’s latest product as of this writing and should come 
with the latest version of the BlackBerry operating system (OS). So, you 
shouldn’t need this section for some time. But when it comes down to it, the 
BlackBerry OS update comes from BlackBerry Handheld Software, which is 
available from two sources:
 
✓ Your network service provider
 
✓ Your BlackBerry system administrator
 
The handheld software may differ from provider to provider, so get it from the 
service provider’s Web site. We compiled a location of the download pages for 
different service providers at www.blackberryfordummies.com/bhs.html.
In this section, we assume that the latest BlackBerry Handheld Software 
for BlackBerry is already installed on your PC. For help with installing 
BlackBerry Handheld Software, refer to the instructions that come with it.
 
You should upgrade your BlackBerry OS only when you have to or are told to 
by your network service provider or your corporate BlackBerry system admin-
istrator. Some third-party applications that you installed earlier may stop 
working. The risk of losing third-party application data is always there — as 
well as the risk that things won’t work as well as before.
 
To address the risk of information loss, RIM designed Application Loader to 
automatically back up for you as part of the OS upgrade. However, our experi-
ence has taught us to perform a full backup manually as an extra precaution. 
The Application Loader backup isn’t always complete in our experience. See 
Chapter 18 for more on backing up data manually.

318
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
After you finish a manual backup of your BlackBerry, you can start the 
upgrade process by doing the following:
 
1. Enter your BlackBerry password (if you have set one) into BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on your PC.
 
2. Double-click the Application Loader icon on the Desktop Manager screen.
 
 The Application Loader screen appears, as shown earlier in Figure 19-2.
 
3. Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
 
 A list of software appears, as shown in Figure 19-6.
 
4. With your mouse, you can opt out of the upgrade by deselecting the 
OS portion.
 
 This appears as BlackBerry 4.7 System Software in Figure 19-6.
 
 The OS is listed only if you need an upgrade — it means that your 
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If the OS doesn’t appear in the list, the 
handheld software you installed on the desktop machine is the same as 
the one installed on your device, or a prior version compared to the one 
installed on your device.
 
 You also need to back up your device in case something goes wrong with 
the upgrade. Backup options can be accessed through the Options button.
 
5. Click the Options button.
 
 The Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 19-7. This is where you 
decide whether you want to back up your BlackBerry content before 
upgrading your OS.

updates 
that are 
available.

 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
 
Figure 19-7:

6. Select Back Up Device Automatically During the Installation Process 
and click the OK button.
 
 You’re back to the previous screen shown in Figure 19-6.
 
7. Click the Next button.
 
 A summary page confirms your actions — a final chance for you to 
either proceed with the OS upgrade or not.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window 
that shows a series of steps and a progress bar. The entire process takes 
ten minutes or more, depending on your PC model and the OS version 
you’re upgrading to.
 
 At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your BlackBerry display 
goes on and off. Don’t worry; this is normal.
 
 When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Finding and Installing Applications 
from App Stores
With the success of the iPhone App Store, several copycats sprouted up for 
other platforms, including the BlackBerry. App Store is an application that 
behaves as storefronts that showcase applications that you can download 
directly to your device. Applications can be either free or fee-based:
 
✓ Handango (www.handango.com): Handango is one of the oldest store-
fronts that sells applications for mobile devices. It started selling apps 
through the Web but now has an app store that you can download from 
its Web site.

320
Part IV: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
 
✓ CrackBerry On-Device App Store (http://crackberryappstore.
com): Partnering with Mobihand, CrackBerry also provides an app store 
where you can find great applications to download.
 
✓ BlackBerry Application Center: This is available to newer devices start-
ing with the BlackBerry Storm. The carrier has controls on what shows 
up on the Application Center.
 
✓ BlackBerry Application StoreFront (coming soon): This is still cooking 
in RIM’s oven as of this writing. In contrast to BlackBerry Application 
Center, with the BlackBerry Application StoreFront, RIM has full control 
on what applications are available instead of the carrier. RIM made an 
official announcement about this app store. Check our companion Web 
site (www.blackberryfordummies.com) regularly for updates. We’ll 
post a link when it becomes available.

Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
In This Chapter
▶ microSD card
▶ Remote Stereo Gateway
▶ Stereo headphones
▶ Belt clip
▶ Screen protector
▶ Extra battery and charger
▶ Full keyboard
▶ External speakerphone
▶ Car mount
▶ Unify AV Solution
T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger, a 
micro USB cable, and a belt clip. If you’re like us, though, you’re not satisfied 
with what is included in the box. In this chapter, we present the accessories 
that we think supplement your BlackBerry well — and we tell you where to 
shop for them.
 
Check out our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com, for 
an updated accessories list.
microSD Card
Your new BlackBerry normally comes with external memory: a microSD card. 
But if you are not satisfied with its capacity, then go hunt for a much bigger 
one. After all, you want to carry with you a boatload of music and video files, 
right? Many electronic gadgets use microSD cards, so they’re easy to find.
A normal price range at the time of this writing is $30 for an 8GB capacity and 
$60 for 16GB capacity. Your best bet of finding a good deal is on the Internet. 
Special promotions come and go, but we noticed that you can always find a 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
good deal somewhere. Our best advice is to just shop around. And for any 
Internet purchase, take into consideration the shipping and handling costs 
plus the vendor’s return policy (or lack thereof).
 
Any brand will do, as long as you make sure that you’re buying a microSD card.
BlackBerry Remote Stereo Gateway
Do you want to make your home-entertainment center play the music in your 
BlackBerry? The Remote Stereo Gateway is for you. Connect this tiny device 
to your stereo system and you can transmit music wirelessly from your 
BlackBerry (for about $90).
 
You can get Remote Stereo Gateway from RIM’s shopping site at www.shop
blackberry.com.
Stereo Headsets
Although your new BlackBerry is a stereo music player, it doesn’t come with 
stereo headphones. You will definitely yearn for stereo sound the moment 
you listen to music or watch video clips. A quick search on the Internet for 
BlackBerry + stereo headphones yields many results. But you want to be able 
to talk, too.
You could spend $30 to $200. We like several headsets:
 
✓ BlackBerry stereo headset with noise-isolating ear gels
 
✓ V-MODA Vibe duo in-ear headphones with mic
 
✓ Motorola S9 stereo Bluetooth headset
 
The best place to get stereo headphones for your BlackBerry is good ol’ 
Amazon: www.amazon.com.
Case and Belt Clip
You have plenty of cases to choose from, with looks ranging from sporty to 
professional. These cases can set you back anywhere from $20 to $40, which 
isn’t too bad for looking hip.

325
 Chapter 20: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
Here’s where you can buy a new case or belt clip:
 
✓ http://shop.crackberry.com
 
✓ www.bberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberryden.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.amazon.com
 
When you buy a new belt case or clip, buy one made specifically for your 
BlackBerry model. Also, it’s important that the case/clip comes with a small 
magnet. BlackBerry is holster-aware and conserves battery juice. And this 
magnet is the key for the BlackBerry to know that it is inside a holster.
Screen Protector and Skins
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful for 
your wallet, try the Blackberry Pro high-definition screen protector with 
mirror effect. That’s a mouthful, but for about $10, it protects your screen 
from scratches. Go to www.accessorygeeks.com.
Other popular bestsellers are skin cases. It comes with many colors and 
keeps your BlackBerry looking new. The price is usually between $9 and $12. 
Go to http://shop.crackberry.com or www.accessorygeeks.com.
Extra Battery, Charger, 
and Charging Pod
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you’re a daily user.
 
We recommend buying your battery only from Research In Motion, at www.
shopblackberry.com, and not from some other manufacturer. A faulty 
battery can damage your BlackBerry beyond repair.
 
Make sure that the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model. You’ll spend 
around $50 for the extra battery.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you watch video on your BlackBerry, you know that the battery needs to 
be charged every couple of hours. And if you’re always on the go, you better 
have a portable charger on hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry 
is great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapt-
ers for different countries’ electric plugs.
If you’re a road warrior, we recommend the BlackBerry car charger. It will 
set you back around $30. To top it off, you can also get a charging pod. It’s an 
accessory that connects to a power supply for charging and at the same time 
holds your BlackBerry firmly in place in your desk or nightstand. If you use it 
in your nightstand, you can take advantage of the sleep mode which sets the 
device so that it least disturbs you, such as dimming the light and turning off 
the LED. The charging pod costs from $12 to $30, depending on how fancy it is.
 
Make sure that the charger and the charging pod you buy is for your 
BlackBerry model.
You can get a BlackBerry car charger and charging pod from the following sites:
 
✓ http://shop.crackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.amazon.com
 
✓ www.shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
Full Keyboard
If you write long e-mails or draft long proposals on your BlackBerry, a 
full-sized keyboard is perfect for you. You’ll save time and your thumbs.
 
You have the choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options. We 
recommend Bluetooth to minimize the clutter. A Bluetooth keyboard is the 
most convenient option for the obvious reasons: You don’t have to carry 
cables, and you can position your BlackBerry any way you want.
For less than $100, you can own the cool iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth 
keyboard, available at www.amazon.com. Or you can buy the ThinkOutside 
Stowaway Shasta Bluetooth keyboard for BlackBerry, available at http://
yahooshopping.com for $45.

327
 Chapter 20: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
External Speaker
BlackBerry comes with a speaker, but if the sound quality just isn’t good 
enough for your listening taste, an external Bluetooth speaker can bring your 
outdoor listening to the next level. We recommend the following:
 
✓ Blueant M1 Bluetooth stereo speakers
 
✓ Motorola EQ5 wireless travel stereo speaker
For about $110, you can get either of them from http://shop.crack
berry.com.
Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, mount your BlackBerry in your 
car. The market offers many products that range from $15 to $30. You can 
search from major sites. You can also get a car mount from these BlackBerry 
sites:
 
✓ http://shop.crackberry.com
 
✓ www.blackberrysource.com
 
✓ www.amazon.com
 
Make sure that the product you’re choosing supports your BlackBerry model.
Unify AV Solution
It is an understatement to categorize this product as a BlackBerry accessory. 
But Unify AV Solution is an innovative product of Unify4Life, making smart-
phones (including your BlackBerry) a universal remote control.
You can find a whole suite of features on the Unify4Life Web site, but a sample 
includes complete TV listings available in your BlackBerry for informative 
channel switching. We encourage you to check out Unify AV Solution and,
for $99, you can purchase it directly from http://unify4life.com/
products.html.

Ten Must-Have 
BlackBerry Programs
In This Chapter
▶ SmrtGuard
▶ VibAndRing
▶ Handmark Pocket Express
▶ PeeKaWho — Email/SMS Alert
▶ Digby
▶ Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo! Messenger Mobile
▶ iSkoot Skype Client
▶ Nobex Radio Companion
▶ WorldMate
▶ Ascendo Money
T
he industry of BlackBerry software is growing at a dizzying rate. In 
this chapter, we introduce ten must-have applications that make your 
BlackBerry experience that much better.
We have no specific reviews to quote, but these choices are the results of 
our quest to find programs that people use, discerned from discussions with 
BlackBerry users, postings on message boards, and commentaries in the 
public domain. The applications we feature here are just the tip of the ice-
berg. By all means, feel free to surf the Internet because by the time this book 
is published, more software will likely be available. And don’t forget to visit 
our Web site at www.blackberryfordummies.com.
SmrtGuard, Your BlackBerry Guardian
Have you ever wondered what would happen to your data if you lost your 
BlackBerry? Data such as your sensitive e-mails, your phone call histories, 

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your contacts, and all your appointments? It’s scary to think of a stranger 
getting to know you through your e-mails and knowing what you’re going to 
do next. These same thoughts haunt us as well. Thankfully there’s SmrtGuard 
(formerly known as BerryFinder.com), which provides the following tools:
 
✓ Locate and “LoJack” your BlackBerry: With no GPS required, you can 
track your BlackBerry’s approximate location to determine whether you 
simply misplaced it or someone actually stole it.
 
✓ Wireless data backup: This is another must-have feature that 
SmrtGuard provides. If you self-destroyed your data and don’t have a 
backup, the scheduled wireless backup of your PIM data will come in 
handy. From the SmrtGuard Web site (www.smrtguard.com), you can 
even see and browse through your backed up data and export it to a file 
(an Excel file or text file).
 
✓ Sound the homing beacon: If you simply misplaced your BlackBerry but 
can’t find it by calling because you muted it, don’t worry. Just send a 
homing beacon, and your BlackBerry will emit a loud sound regardless 
of your Profile setting. We wish our remote controls had this feature!
 
✓ Self-destroy in five seconds: Okay, perhaps not in five seconds, but 
you can decide when to destroy all your BlackBerry data. That includes 
e-mails, contacts, appointments, to-dos, memos, phone logs, and even 
all the files on your microSD card.
 
Always protect your BlackBerry with a password. That way, if your BlackBerry 
gets into the wrong hands, your data will be self-erased after ten unsuccessful 
password entries. However, it doesn’t delete the files on your microSD card. 
This is why SmrtGuard is so helpful.
With SmrtGuard by your side, you can concentrate on your business instead 
of worrying about your BlackBerry data being stolen. For a limited time, 
SmrtGuard is free. Register your BlackBerry today at www.smrtguard.com.
VibAndRing
Don’t like the fact that you can’t get your BlackBerry to alert you the way you 
want? Do you need custom vibration when a phone call comes in?
Time to get your hands on VibAndRing. With it, you can customize how many 
vibrate “bursts” you get before it starts ringing and how long each vibration 
lasts.
To download a free trial, go to www.mobihand.com and search for vibandring.

331
 Chapter 21: Ten Must-Have BlackBerry Programs
Handmark Pocket Express
If we have to recommend one application, Pocket Express is it. This is a handy 
and reliable tool to get news and other important information such as weather, 
sports updates, maps, and stocks. This application is one of the best informa-
tion aggregators out there. The user interface is intuitive. You can even buy and 
install other applications from within Pocket Express. And the best part — it’s 
free. Well, not everything. Handmark charges a fee for accessing its premium 
channels. Download Pocket Express from your BlackBerry at http://
pocketexpress.com.
PeeKaWho — Email/SMS Alerts
Ever find yourself in the middle of browsing or composing an e-mail and all of a 
sudden, a new e-mail finds its way to your inbox? Instead of stopping what you 
are doing and heading to the inbox, with PeeKaWho, you can get a preview of 
the e-mail or SMS message that has just arrived, and you can dismiss, mark as 
read, go to your inbox, or delete the message — all right from the alert pop-up.
To find out more, go to www.smrtguard.com/peek.jsp.
Digby
For those online shoppers who need to shop all the time, Digby is the program 
for you. You can download it for free to start browsing its growing selections. 
What we don’t like is that you have to enter your personal information on the 
BlackBerry instead of having the option to enter it on the PC first. To try it, 
point your BlackBerry browser to www.digby.com/download.
Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo! 
Messenger Mobile
If you currently use Google Talk or Yahoo! Messenger on your PC, both 
mobile versions are a must-download to keep up with your buddies no matter 
where you are. To download, point your BlackBerry browser to
 
✓ Google Talk Mobile: www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger Mobile: www.blackberry.com/YahooDownload

332

iSkoot Skype Client
If you are a big fan of Skype, now you don’t have to be at your computer to 
use the service. The folks at iSkoot make it possible for you to fully utilize 
Skype from your BlackBerry. Calling a Skype buddy? No problem. Chatting 
with your Skype friends? That’s what this program is for. Plus, it’s free! To 
download it from your PC, go to www.iskoot.com.
Nobex Radio Companion
FM radio on your BlackBerry? That’s right. With Nobex, you can get stream-
ing radio on your BlackBerry for free (for now)!
Over a hundred stations are available for streaming, and it works best if you 
have a 3G or EVDO network (the faster the network, the better your experi-
ence with Nobex).
To find out more, go to www.nobexrc.com.
WorldMate
Are you a road warrior? If so, WorldMate is for you. You can set up your 
home airport as well as a travel schedule. If your flight is delayed, you will be 
notified. It also has convenient features like a currency converter, world time, 
and weather forecasts.
To find out more, visit www.mobimate.com.
Ascendo Money
Ascendo Money is one of the best-selling, best-rated, and most comprehen-
sive personal finance managers for BlackBerry. You can manage your check-
book, track your expenses, sync with your PC, and integrate with popular 
finance PC applications such as Quicken and MS Money. It costs $29.95, but 
you can also get a free trial. You can download Ascendo Money from your PC 
by going to www.handango.com.

W
ho says BlackBerry is all work and no play? True, you can get tons 
accomplished on your BlackBerry, but what you get accomplished 
doesn’t necessarily need to be work related. Yes, you do have the BrickBreaker 
game that comes with your BlackBerry, but you can only beat it so many times 
before you get bored.
As the BlackBerry becomes increasingly popular, numerous BlackBerry game 
companies are making more and more fun titles. For example, you can play 
a couple of holes on the Pebble Beach golf course, or you can play a game of

Ten Web Site Categories for 
BlackBerry Browsing
In This Chapter
▶ Weather
▶ News
▶ Search engines, directories, and portals
▶ Business
▶ Travel
▶ Sports
▶ Advice and self-help
▶ Social and virtual networking
▶ Shopping and shipping information
▶ Other browsing categories
W
eb surfing with a BlackBerry has improved dramatically with the newer 
models. With higher screen resolution and bigger real estate, your 
BlackBerry should give you one good mobile Web-browsing experience. In the 
previous editions of BlackBerry For Dummies, we told you where to find Web 
sites designed for mobile devices because most Web pages displayed horribly 
on the older devices. That’s not the case anymore; most Web pages now display 
just as well on newer models of the BlackBerry as they do on your PC. So, the 
browsing habit you have on your PC can now be maintained in the BlackBerry, 
but in a small package.
The Web site recommendations we give in this chapter are based on reviews 
in the public domain and sites that definitely help you on the go.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Weather
Weather changes quite often, but you can keep up with it at these sites:
 
✓ AccuWeather.com (www.accuweather.com): AccuWeather.com pro-
vides the local weather forecast.
 
✓ Weather.com (www.weather.com): Weather.com is smart enough to 
know that you’re using a mobile device and displays a nice, trim version 
of its page with a few links to non-weather–related information.
If these two sites aren’t enough, check out the “Search Engines, Directories, 
and Portals” section, later in this chapter. Major portals have weather infor-
mation as well as traffic alerts and airport delays.
News
Most major news companies have mobile versions of their sites. This section 
gives you just a sampling of what’s out there. We list the same Web address 
as you would expect when browsing from your desktop. These sites detect 
that you’re using a smartphone and redirect you to the mobile-friendly ver-
sion of their sites:
 
✓ ABC News (www.abcnews.com): Get ABC News on your BlackBerry.
 
✓ BBC News (www.bbc.com): You can read the BBC News right from your 
BlackBerry, even if you’re not in the UK.
 
✓ CNN (www.cnn.com): This is CNN’s mobile-friendly Web site.
 
✓ The New York Times (www.nytimes.com): This automatically points 
you to the New York Times mobile-friendly Web site, a site that’s clean 
and easy to navigate without a lot of advertisements.
 
✓ Reuters (www.reuters.com): A mobile-friendly version of the Reuters site.
 
✓ USA Today (http://usatoday.com): USA Today, one of the most 
popular newspapers, is now available for free from your BlackBerry.
 
✓ Wired News (http://mobile.wired.com): Wired News is the mobile 
version of this tech news Web site.

339
 Chapter 23: Ten Web Site Categories for BlackBerry Browsing
Search Engines, Directories, and Portals
The sites that follow are Web portals, which are sites that contain various 
information or links to other sites:
 
✓ Google (www.google.com): The king of search engines works like a 
charm on your BlackBerry.
 
✓ MSN (www.msn.com): You can access MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger, 
and an online calendar. It has all the features that you can find in a Web 
portal, such as Web search, weather lookup, sports information, and

the-minute stock quotes.
 
✓ RIM mobile home page (http://mobile.blackberry.com): This is 
the default home page setting for most BlackBerry browsers. The ser-
vice provider can customize it, though, so your BlackBerry browser may 
point to your service provider’s home page. RIM’s home page is defi-
nitely a place to start browsing the Web.
 
 You should definitely bookmark this site.
 
✓ Yahoo! Mobile (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo! is a smart portal because it 
knows you’re using a mobile device and formats the page accordingly — 
meaning a smaller page with no advertisements. The portal site allows 
BlackBerry users to employ regular Yahoo! functions, such as Yahoo! 
Mail, Messenger, Finance, and Games, as well as driving directions and 
weather.
 
 You should definitely bookmark this site.
Business
You can keep up with the latest news in the finance world from your 
BlackBerry. Visit the following sites for finance-related articles and news:

great finance information.

age firm.
