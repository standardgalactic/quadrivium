n the Internet, governments, big business, private citizens, and crimi-
nals have all learned how to harvest and use personal data for many 
purposes—both legal and illegal. In fact, any person or business that 
cares to harvest that information and has developed a basic level of skill can do 
so. This is the main thrust of Theresa Payton and Ted Claypoole’s excellent 
work, Protecting Your Internet Identity. They point out that although the Internet 
and Web represent some of the greatest technological innovations in the world, 
they present risks and dangers few Internet users appreciate. As a result, people 
fail to protect themselves from those who would exploit that information at the 
expense of safety, privacy, and even financial security.
Finally, there is a guide written by cyberexperts, not for technogeeks, but 
for the average Internet user. Cyberauthorities Payton and Claypoole explain 
in plain language how the World Wide Web is actually the “Wild Wild Web.” 
They explain why we must open our eyes to the peril we are exposed to when 
we engage in routine activities such as opening a browser, accessing our e-mail, 
or paying our bills online. This book is required reading for Internet users 
because it simplifies critical concepts about the cyberenvironment and provides 
the reader with essential knowledge and tips on how to mitigate the dangers and 
become the master of your Internet persona.
The Internet is one of the last frontiers. It is barely regulated and never 
policed. When you access the Internet, there are no rules, and therefore no rules 
to enforce. As coauthor and Internet law expert Ted Claypoole points out, pri-
vacy laws are impotent when it comes to Internet-related privacy breeches, and 
there are only a handful of practical remedies. The book effectively paints the 
picture in terms we all can understand. We seldom stop to total how much sen-
sitive information about ourselves we voluntarily consign to others in exchange 
for social interaction, a discount, or simply to access a product or service. This 
information can be our most private thoughts expressed on Facebook, purchases 
made while displaying our preferred customer card, our physical location via the

GPS on our mobile device, and even our financial data courtesy of our favorite 
financial institution. Inevitably this information ends up on the Internet, where 
it is vulnerable to being bought and sold by various businesses and marketing 
firms or stolen and exploited by tech-savvy criminal organizations.
The irony is not so much that we give the information voluntarily but that 
most of us have no idea how to exercise control over how that information is 
acquired and used. Theresa Payton is an authority on this subject, having held an 
executive-level technology security position at one of the world’s largest financial 
institutions and worked on the front lines of the cyberwars as the chief informa-
tion officer (CIO) for the White House. She and Claypoole present a tutorial 
on how we can control and effectively harness the information we expose for our 
own purposes, such as facilitating a business marketing plan or just to protect our 
privacy in a digital world. This is valuable information for people who are uneasy 
about exposing their information on the Web.
Chapter 6 describes the unlimited opportunities for cybercriminals to steal 
via the Internet. Theft of data is the perfect crime. It can be stolen from a 
computer in Russia, Bulgaria, or Romania, but unlike a car, jewelry, or a tan-
gible object, it is not “missing.” It’s still there on your computer, and you don’t 
notice something bad has happened until it’s too late. As an FBI special agent 
for twenty-five years and ultimately the head of all FBI criminal investigations, 
I developed an acute understanding of how the Internet evolved to become 
the nesting ground and launching pad for the most sophisticated criminals 
in the world. The old brick-and-mortar crime model is outdated. In this new 
crime paradigm, the old adage that you can steal more money with a pen than 
a gun needs updating: you can steal more money with a computer than a gun. 
Cyberthieves never have to set foot in this country, making it difficult to inves-
tigate, and even more difficult to prosecute, violators.
Claypoole and Payton explain how the new black market currency is “per-
sonally identifiable information” (PII) and how these cybergangs use social 
engineering techniques such as phishing, pharming, whaling, and malware of 
every description to steal your user ID, password, or other sensitive information. 
Chapter 6 describes how this information is sold on the cyber black market and 
ultimately used to take over your bank accounts or even your identity.
Chapter 10, which deals with child predators on the Internet, is a must-read 
for parents with children who surf the Web, e-mail, tweet, Facebook, text, or 
routinely touch the Internet in any fashion. This chapter describes the dangers 
presented by pedophiles and sex offenders who troll the Internet for lonely teens 
and attempt to gain their trust. The ultimate goal of many of these deviants is to 
make personal contact with these vulnerable children for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation. It’s not a pretty picture, but it is entirely preventable. This chapter 
alone is worth the price of the book.

Nothing that touches the Internet is secure. This has been widely acknowledged 
by U.S. government officials such as Gordon Snow, assistant director of the 
FBI’s Cyber Crime Division, in his statement before the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
Committee on April 12, 2011, where he testified that “a determined adversary 
will likely be able to penetrate any system that is accessible directly from the 
Internet.” The Internet is a high-crime neighborhood and must be respected if 
you are going to expose your personal information to every other human being 
on the planet.
If one were to prioritize chapters of this book in order of importance and 
relevance to your online wellness, I highly recommend dwelling on chapters 8 
and 11, which deal with exercising your choice to be invisible online when you 
feel the need to do so. As the authors point out, our online anonymity and pri-
vacy are distinct from each other. Privacy is generally a legal standard, whereas 
choosing to be anonymous requires taking steps to disguise your true identity, 
which Internet users may do for valid reasons. This chapter is an invaluable aid 
to those doing Web research, blogging, or who are active social networkers. Fol-
lowing the advice provided is another step to clothing yourself and your loved 
ones from 800 million prying eyes. In this area knowledge is power.
This book is direct, digestible, and practical. Unfortunately, most works that 
deal with cybersecurity and data privacy are readable only by techies and attor-
neys who specialize in this area of the law. Most people know how to use the 
Internet and the latest electronic communication devices, but they are not inter-
ested in mastering the inner workings of the technology. Use of industry jargon 
and dissecting the technology behind firewalls and viruses or parsing complex 
privacy laws is like telling someone how to build a watch when they only need 
to know the time. Internet users don’t need the subject further obscured or 
complicated; they need the same commonsense awareness levels of the risks and 
dangers that they have concerning their physical security, their houses, their 
cars, and their belongings. The most effective police anticrime campaigns don’t 
dissect the laws and the technology behind burglar alarms, locking devices, or 
pepper spray; they arm you with sensible information and tips on how to avoid 
becoming an easy victim. Bravo for the authors, Claypoole and Payton, who 
have accomplished this with Protecting Your Internet Identity. This book is long 
overdue and will arm you with all the tools and knowledge you need to avoid 
risky, unnecessary exposure. Ignore their advice at your own peril.

Chapter 1
How Were You Exposed?
W
e are all born naked.
We emerge into this world with nothing to hide. But we are born 
into a complex human society, and it soon forces us to cloak our-
selves in secrets. We choose to hide many aspects of ourselves from the world. 
Finances and romances, opinions and frustrations, imperfections and bad habits 
are all sensitive, personal information. The longer our lives, the more private 
information we accumulate.
Today the Internet threatens to strip us bare. By broadcasting many of our 
most sensitive and important secrets and keeping that information available and 
searchable indefinitely, the Internet displays aspects of our lives that we thought 
we’d kept private. Even worse, the Internet allows other people to collect facts 
about us and to aggregate those facts into a picture of our lives. The news is 
filled with stories about young people and celebrities who “tweet” their lives 
away, broadcasting their most intimate thoughts, feelings, and circumstances to 
anyone who will pay attention. The current world of reality television is built 
on the relationships between exhibitionists who will do anything for fame and 
voyeurs who find their actions fascinating. Social media sites such as Facebook 
and Instagram rely on their users’ eagerness to share information—both intimate 
and mundane—in real time. Current culture is a fact-sharing machine, and the 
Internet is one of its most prominent engines.
This book starts with the assumption that some aspects of our lives should 
not be shared with everyone in the world and that you should have control over 
what you share and how you share it. We believe that privacy has value. Privacy 
protects our families and our peace of mind. Privacy is a strategy for shielding 
resources from thieves and our children from predators, it is a prudent business 
tactic for negotiations, and it is an important social tool when meeting new 
people. In this chapter, we look at how your personal information has become a 
commodity and just who is exposing you online.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

Putting the Persona in Perspective
Elia Kazan, the great American film director and cofounder of the Actors Stu-
dio, said, “I am many men, but none of them is me.” The various aspects of a 
personality can add up to a whole person, but no single aspect accurately portrays 
a person’s life. The Internet persona is, in many ways, a separate self. This public 
self may reflect a portion of the private self, but the private self is always much 
more than the online persona reveals.
The Internet persona is a shadow of celebrity. You can learn more about your 
neighbors or some of your children’s teachers than the most avid tabloid readers 
could have discovered about their favorite celebrities thirty years ago. When a 
private citizen tweets about her breakfasts on Twitter, shows her travel photos on 
Instagram or Tumblr, discusses her favorite team in public sports comments, and 
explains her business on LinkedIn and her company website, you could spend 
all day just following her movements. An Internet persona can be celebrated or 
excoriated, but it is most often ignored until a need arises to know more. So it 
rests and grows online, waiting for someone to care enough to pay attention.
The Historical Persona
Most of our parents and grandparents did not make distinctions between 
their public and private personas because they were known by their neighbors, 
family, and friends and no one else. Without the self-publishing tool of the 
Internet, private individuals remained private to the world and left only a trail 
of official notices in their wakes—birth records, wedding announcements, 
land transfers, and obituaries describing as much of their lives as their children 
wanted to expose. Before the Internet, a public persona was not an option or a 
problem to be managed for most people. It simply did not exist.
Of course, some people in past centuries who were published authors or 
entertainers led more public lives. Their lives provide an interesting example of 
the management and manipulation of public faces. These writers, politicians, 
and entertainers of the past help us understand how a public image differs from 
a private image. In some cases, a leader’s supporters created myths to emphasize 
the leader’s more admirable traits. Young George Washington never chopped 
down a cherry tree or said, “I cannot tell a lie,” and a three-year-old Davy 
Crockett clearly did not kill a bear. The public persona of each celebrity was 
exaggerated for effect.
Sometimes writers created a different public persona to hide behind when 
writing dangerously controversial material. In the eighteenth century, François-
Marie Arouet published his work under dozens of pseudonyms, including the 
name Voltaire. His influential writings on politics and the rights of man were 
inflammatory enough to earn him exile from his homeland. Many of the most

influential arguments for the ratification of the U.S. Constitution were pub-
lished in the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym Publius, and these were 
probably written by American founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James 
Madison, and John Jay. These authors chose to develop public images that dif-
fered from their private lives.
The Internet Persona
In the age of the Internet, a public persona is forced on us, growing with 
or without our conscious contribution. Thanks to the Internet, we are all enter-
tainers and publishers now. We can all send thoughts, opinions, and videos of 
ourselves throughout the world with the click of a mouse or tap of a finger. 
Hundreds of millions of people have Facebook pages, LiveJournal diaries, Flickr 
picture archives, or postings on other social media sites. Millions of people com-
ment on public message boards for the New York Times online, CNET, the Fox 
News website, and ESPN.com. Thousands of new blogs are published every day. 
Now that everyone is able to entertain or publish online, the Internet persona is 
a fact of life for all of us, and it is a permanent, written record of our lives out 
there for everyone to see.
The Growth of Your Online Personas
Information about each of us collects on the Internet. This happens whether 
we approve of the information and whether we intentionally contribute it. As 
you’ll see later in this chapter, you and others are building your online persona 
through a variety of activities. The things you write about yourself and your life, 
the pictures you or others upload, define you for many Internet users.
Even people who never go online have information about them posted on 
the Internet. Significant information about your life is available from public 
databases. Organizations that you join may provide facts about you on the Inter-
net. Friends may expose information and never think to ask you if that’s okay. 
Coworkers may post information about you on their social media pages.
This set of information may not be an accurate description of you, but 
because it’s easy to find on search engines, this is what many people consider 
to be the truth about you. You can ignore your online persona and let it grow 
unchecked, or you can measure it and manage it, just as famous entertainers or 
authors manage their stage or literary personas.
One Example: Online Scandal
Consider a scandal in Washington, D.C., played out online but with con-
sequences in the real world.
Jessica Cutler, twenty-six years old, worked as an aide to Ohio senator Mike 
DeWine. After work, Cutler led an active social life, but when she decided to

document her social liaisons in the nation’s capital, her life took a wrong turn 
that ended badly for her.1
Cutler created an Internet diary, called a blog. Her blog was anonymous and 
published online under the title of Washingtonienne. The Washingtonienne blog 
created a scandal as readers tried to guess the identities of the writer and her 
paramours. She described frequent sexual liaisons with men in her life, writing 
at one point that she was currently having sex “with six guys. Ewww.”
It’s easy to see why the Washingtonienne blog became required reading for so 
many people working in D.C. Nearly every day brought news of another sexual 
rendezvous, including the Washington hangouts where meetings occurred, inti-
mate descriptions of what happened, and the writer’s evaluation of her feelings 
about the men involved and about her own behavior. She discussed her lovers’ 
high-powered political jobs, but she protected their identities with a mysterious 
letter code. No one knew who the Washingtonienne was or who she was meeting. 
Her blog made it seem that she could be sitting next to you at a Georgetown bar 
or an Arlington restaurant on any given night, then going home or to a hotel 
for outrageous carnal activity, only to jump online the next morning and tell 
everyone about it.
She claimed to be trading sex for money with powerful men, writing, “Most 
of my living expenses are thankfully subsidized by a few generous older gentle-
men. I’m sure I am not the only one who makes money on the side this way: 
how can anybody live on $25K/year??”
Anonymous Internet writers had created hoaxes before and the 
Washingtonienne’s stories seemed too lurid to be true, yet the details seemed 
too specific to be a deception. People talked about her in their offices. Who 
was the Washingtonienne, and did she really work on Capitol Hill? How was 
she juggling this many relationships? Was it true that a presidentially appointed 
chief of staff was paying her for sex?
Her life, which seemed so out of control to readers of her blog, finally 
crashed. The Washingtonienne was fired from her job on Senator DeWine’s 
staff for misuse of government computers. This was the last post before 
Washingtonienne’s firing: “I just took a long lunch with X and made a quick 
$400. When I returned to the office, I heard that my boss was asking about my 
whereabouts. Loser.”
Another female Washington, D.C., government blogger, Ana Marie Cox 
of the popular policy blog Wonkette, named Jessica Cutler as the author of 
the Washingtonienne blog. Ms. Cox ran an interview with Ms. Cutler on the 
Wonkette blog, and the Washington Post soon followed suit with a full-feature 
story including pictures of the mysterious Washingtonienne.
Ms. Cutler’s secret identity as the Washingtonienne affected her life in many 
ways, apart from the lost job in the U.S. Senate offices. Predictably, Ms. Cutler

posed naked for Playboy and was offered a book deal worth a reported $300,000 
advance. Her book inspired a Washingtonienne-based television series produced 
by HBO. She was also sued by one of her coworkers, who alleged that he was 
discussed in the Washingtonienne blog as one of her many lovers. Ms. Cutler 
ended up filing for bankruptcy.2
Cutler was literally and figuratively naked online. She developed an online 
persona, and it took over her life. She believed she could hide behind an anony-
mous Internet pen name, but in the end, her online persona merged with her 
real life of work, family, and friends. She was not the first to develop a separate 
online persona or the first to make money from doing so. Bloggers with online 
pseudonyms like Perez Hilton, the Daily Kos, and Lonelygirl15 boast millions 
of readers.
Although writing salacious autobiography has long been a path to celeb-
rity, today’s Internet provides fame and infamy to people who are clever 
or even unlucky with a smartphone camera. For example, more than forty 
million viewers subscribe to a YouTube channel where they watch a young 
Swedish man play video games and comment on the action. The man calls 
himself PewDiePie, and he made more than $7 million in 2014 from his 
YouTube following.3 Another video channel called Vine only allows clips of 
six seconds or shorter and has spawned movie deals and significant incomes 
to the people who produce and star in these tiny films. A company may pay 
up to $50,000 for a Vine star to use its product in the six-second video.4 Paul 
Vasquez, a California firefighter and trucker, became an overnight Internet 
sensation when he was caught on video effusing over a double rainbow. He 
later turned his Internet fame into a sponsorship deal with Microsoft. He 
is known to the millions of people who have seen his video as “the double-
rainbow guy.”
The Moral?
We are all complicated people with many aspects to our lives, and we 
change our identities as we grow in life. Today’s wild child is tomorrow’s 
suburban housewife. Today’s poor college student may be running a huge 
corporation tomorrow. Seeing one aspect of someone’s life through the 
prism of Internet writing may provide insight into that person, but it dis-
plays a skewed and inaccurate overall portrait. Cutler may have matured into 
a sedate wife and mother, but many people will know her primarily for the 
wildness of her young, single years and the scandal it caused. Vasquez will 
eternally be tied to one excitable moment caught on video. An Internet per-
sona can be dangerous for many reasons, but it can be particularly dangerous 
as a brief snapshot from which people draw broader conclusions for years to 
come.

How Information Is Treated Online
In results that surprised even the researchers, a study conducted by social scien-
tists at the University of California–Berkeley and the University of Pennsylva-
nia found that American adults between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four 
claim to care as much about online privacy as older adults.5 The study also 
found that young people tended to not understand the laws concerning privacy 
protection and to overestimate how much legal privacy protection individuals 
receive online. The researchers determined that “young-adult Americans have 
an aspiration for increased privacy even while they participate in an online real-
ity that is optimized to increase their revelation of personal data.” And they’re 
not alone.
Social media rewards its users for publishing more and more information 
all the time. Comments, picture postings, likes, and the use of popular hashtags 
build a person’s popularity and raise the profile of the poster. Find and post the 
most and best beach photographs or architectural drawings on Instagram and 
you are more likely to find other people interested in the same things you are. 
Tweet the most about a political position and garner the attention of the top 
people promoting the same position. On social media, more information means 
more interaction and more chances at a meaningful connection to other people.
What Information Can Be Discovered Online?
Imagine that new neighbors are coming to live next door. You haven’t seen 
them yet but know that they closed on the house and are moving in next month. 
What could you discover about them using the Internet, even if you don’t know 
their names?
You know their new address, so you can find their names online in the 
county records describing the real estate transfer of their new house, and you can 
probably find out their current address. You can also discover how much the new 
neighbors paid for the house and what lender they used, if they have a mortgage.
If both names of a married couple are included in the housing records, you 
can search the wedding announcements in the archives of their hometown news-
paper to get more information about them. For example, the New York Times 
provides a searchable archive of wedding announcements published since 1981, 
including full text and analysis of hundreds of thousands of nuptials.
So what could you learn from these sources? You can find out their full 
family names, their ages, their parents’ names and occupations, where the 
couple attended school, and some financial information. A quick search for birth 
announcements related to the same couple may yield the names and ages of their 
children. Many towns also keep dog license registration records online, so you 
may be able to find out what breed they own and even the dog’s name.

You can do all of this research on public Internet sites without ever running 
a general search for either neighbor’s name using a search engine such as Google, 
Yahoo!, or Bing. But if you need more information to perform ID theft or stalk 
a family member, you’ll find that general searches can unearth employment 
information, family and genealogy data, social media postings made by family 
members themselves, and much, much more.
Exposure Is Rewarded
Everyone participating on the Internet exists in a world geared toward 
encouraging exposure of personal data. Social media sites are built to reward 
the sharing of information. The more people know about you on Facebook, 
the more points of connection they find and the more “friends” you will attract.
Information Rules
Think about the basic information most Facebook users reveal, then 
measure how many classmates, former coworkers, fellow Labradoodle lovers, 
cybercreeps, and long-lost family members are attracted by these revelations. 
Facebook’s marketing pitch generally includes the concept that “you get more 
out of it if you put more into it.” Your active participation in these sites is a cycle 
of personal disclosure and social or financial rewards for your level of sharing.
People use social media as a confessional, a watercooler, and even a psycho-
analyst’s couch. They tell secrets, they cry out in anguish, and they beg for other 
people to react. In many Internet communities, the deepest secrets and rawest 
emotions are rewarded with the warmest words of acceptance. Author Dave 
Eggers, exploring how people use social media as a tool for human connection, 
wrote in his book The Circle, “Suffering is only suffering if it’s done in silence, 
in solitude. Pain experienced in public, in view of loving millions, was no longer 
pain. It was communion.”6
In addition, commercial websites, from newspapers to banks and stores 
selling goods and services online, can profit from knowledge of their customers 
and visitors. Those sites encourage visitor participation and often place software 
called cookies onto visitors’ computers. Cookies allow the sites to recognize your 
computer when you visit, track your shopping activity, make suggestions of 
items you might like, and even greet you by name.
Cookies and other tracking technologies also allow owners of commercial 
sites to better understand the habits of their Internet visitors and often to sell 
that information to advertisers. Those advertisers can then create more targeted 
advertising.
For example, have you ever noticed that the same banner advertisements 
seem to follow your browser as you click through various Internet pages? Why 
does your spouse always see ads about sports cars, whereas you see ads about

cooking? Some sites make assumptions about you and use these assumptions 
to place you in an advertising program based on your online activities and cal-
culated to interest you. You would be surprised (and not a little frightened) at 
the information they collect about you from a variety of sources to make these 
assumptions.
Although capturing your data for online advertising has always been surrep-
titious and hard to spot, a new trend sneaks its signals right past your ears. As 
both Internet browsing and online marketing become more sophisticated, the 
tracking tools change. Following the rise of smartphones and tablets to access 
the Internet, advertisers were faced with a new challenge to know their prospec-
tive customers: how can a marketer know that the “John Lee” who accessed the 
Levi’s website from his laptop computer is the same “John Lee” who accessed the 
Levi’s website from his smartphone, or his tablet, or his television, or his car, or 
his desktop computer at work? Stitching together the knowledge of who is oper-
ating each of these devices is an exercise called cross-platform marketing, or, more 
specifically, cross-device tracking and attempts to learn about all of a user’s access 
devices have grabbed the attention of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 
Marketers such as SilverPush have been experimenting with strange technology 
to track their customers across various Internet access devices. 
Some advertisers are using subsonic signals—sounds that are too low or too 
high for people to hear—to force Internet access devices to communicate with 
each other. If you visit a SilverPush-enabled site on your laptop computer, the 
computer’s speaker may send out one of these “silent” signals, and the micro-
phone on your smartphone may recognize the signal and the smartphone may 
both store it, and find a way to signal back. SilverPush technology can also 
insert subsonic audio into television commercials that can be “heard” by your 
smartphone or computer without you even knowing the connection exists. This 
method uses device proximity in the real world to discover more information 
about you, rather than relying on your Internet activities.
What Amazon Knows about You
But online collection of your information is amazing too. Amazon is a major 
online retailer, selling everything from clothing to cookware to electronics. This 
company uses its knowledge of the books, music, and other products that you 
have searched for or bought, including how long you spent exploring any single 
topic or item, to suggest additional products that you might be interested in.
If you read descriptions of or buy several books on French cooking, for 
example, you may be shown other popular books on the topic for your consider-
ation. If you buy a vintage Frank Sinatra album or the newest hit from Kendrick 
Lamar, Amazon will propose other music from the same artist or genre that 
customers have purchased recently. This site even encourages you to suggest

music playlists or literary reading lists to guide shoppers who may share your 
preferences, but what they’re really doing is collecting information about your 
interests.
Once again, on this Internet commerce site, just like social media sites, your 
information is solicited and providing more data is rewarded by the site. Not 
only does the site track your movements and purchases, but it also solicits your 
comments and opinions on a broad range of topics, from books you have read 
to the service provided by Amazon. You are encouraged to return to the site and 
offer reviews of any books, music, or other products that you purchased there. 
Your reviews are supposed to provide other shoppers with the benefit of your 
analysis, but at the same time, they give Amazon more information about you.
Amazon allows other product users to rank the helpfulness of your review, 
providing yet another reason for you to return and check how the community 
responded to your wisdom. Each of these acts of sharing is supposed to enrich 
your shopping experience at Amazon, to make the site’s anticipation of your 
wishes more accurate, and to make you feel more like a member of a community.
For Amazon, enriching your online experience in these ways is a psycho-
logical technique to keep you in the website longer and draw you back to the 
online store more often. It is the Internet equivalent of providing a coffee bar 
and comfortable furniture in a brick-and-mortar bookstore to make you feel 
more at home and to encourage you to browse, read, and buy. However, in the 
online version of this strategy, you provide Amazon, and maybe other Amazon 
customers and partners, with a wealth of information about you and about your 
preferences. Amazon takes the information gathering a step further by offer-
ing its Amazon Prime service. For a relatively small annual payment, Amazon 
Prime opens a wide selection of benefits to the Prime customer, from free ship-
ping for items purchased on the main Amazon website to a lending library for 
people who own Amazon’s Kindle tablets. Prime ties an Internet user closer to 
Amazon, because once shipping fees are waived then shopping for nearly any-
thing Amazon offers, from music to gardening tools, becomes easier and as cost 
effective as running to a local store. Membership in Prime also provides Amazon 
with more information about your tastes and priorities.
Amazon is not by any means alone in these practices, and, in unscrupulous 
hands, these same practices can be used for much more than selling you a book 
or DVD.
Why Now?
Why worry now about my online persona? The Internet has been with us for 
a long time—why have we not been reading about issues of privacy in the early 
years? Although the Internet has been available to the general public for more 
than twenty-five years now, the way that it works and the sharing of personal

information have changed drastically over time. At first, the Internet was used 
for computer file transfers, electronic mail, and text-based chat groups. As 
browser software became popular and millions of people joined content-heavy 
services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online, they learned to find 
interesting information about government, businesses, or simply other people.
E-commerce began to flourish online in the 1990s, and within a decade, 
nearly every commercial and consumer business felt the need to supplement 
its sales with some kind of online store. The cost of computer storage dropped 
drastically in the early 2000s. In addition, the development of technologies such 
as video streaming and video sharing allowed websites to use more sophisticated 
graphics, video, and audio files.
The era of Web 2.0, with increased interactivity between Internet users and 
websites, brought with it the possibility that every user of the Internet could 
not only receive information but also share their information and interact with 
others. Applications accessed from devices such as tablets and smartphones have 
moved Internet usage to a mobile platform. And where the Internet was once 
reached primarily through devices created for the task, online access is rapidly 
evolving into an activity that can be enjoyed everywhere from every device—
from automobiles to airplanes to television sets—connectivity is spreading to 
a vast array of machines. These machines also collect and manage information 
about their users.
All of these changes have created a separate realm, accessed by anyone 
with the right cell phone or computer, where people learn and share informa-
tion about each other. It has only been within the last decade, with the rise of 
social networks and the avalanche of personal information migrating online, that 
most of us have developed a substantial online persona. And the issue is likely 
to continue growing in importance as the Internet expands its reach into our 
personal lives.
Now is the time to recognize that you have an online reputation and to take 
control of it before years of information accumulates.
Who’s Looking at You Online?
Before you think about exactly how you might be exposing yourself online, con-
sider who’s looking at your information. Your friends are not the only people 
examining your Facebook page. A study conducted for Careerbuilder.com found 
that 45 percent of companies search social networks to screen employment can-
didates.7 Your spouse’s divorce lawyer is looking, too. A survey conducted by the 
American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers showed that 66 percent of divorce 
lawyers claimed that Facebook was their primary source of evidence.8 And your 
Facebook postings may affect your service on jury duty. For example, the district

attorney’s office of Cameron County, Texas, based in Brownsville, incorporates

any individual or organization, and it will be used to draw conclusions about you

When people tell you that information on the Internet lasts forever, they’re 
right, largely because of the existence of the Internet Archive. The Internet 
Archive is a nonprofit organization, classified as a library in the state of 
California. The library supports an online film archive, one of the world’s 
largest book digitization projects, technology for an online lending library, 
and a distributable digital media collection, including otherwise unavailable 
audio and video files. But the Internet Archive is perhaps best known for its 
capture and collection of historical records of website content.
Also known as the “Wayback Machine,” the Internet Archive’s website 
archiving service keeps searchable, linkable copies of Internet sites as those 
sites existed in the past. If you want to know the board members of your 
local symphony orchestra in 2004, search the orchestra’s website in the Way-
back Machine. Or search the archive if you want to check a friend’s online 
biography posted by the company she worked for two years ago or read her 
review of shoes she bought on a retail site.
Hundreds of millions of sites are available for historical research and 
reference. Since 1996, the Wayback Machine has sent software crawling 
around the World Wide Web and snapping archive copies of various Inter-
net sites from governments, businesses, and private citizens. The Wayback 
Machine only collects publicly available websites, not sites that require a 
password. Not every site is archived, and a site owner can ask to be excluded 
from the archive.
As of the publication of this book, you can find the Wayback Machine 
at www.archive.org. According to the Internet Archive site, the Wayback 
Machine currently includes twenty-three petabytes of data and is growing 
at a rate of twenty terabytes per month. (A petabyte is a unit of information 
equal to one quadrillion bytes of data, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.) The 
Internet Archive also includes a mirrored copy site in Alexandria, Egypt. 
Because of technical complexities, it can take six months to two years for 
recently collected websites to appear in search results on the Wayback 
Machine.

as a romantic partner, potential spouse, employee, church member, potential 
victim of a crime, or parent. (See chapter 2 for more about this topic.)
Who Is Exposing You?
With the right tools, the Internet allows each one of us to customize our own 
Internet presence. Every Internet user can be his or her own broadcaster, 
sending opinions and preferences out to the world. People create blogs and 
diaries online, spilling their deepest thoughts into the cosmos. Social networks 
provide a space for people to display information about themselves but also to 
display their networks of friends and preferences for everything from food to 
relationships.
Today you may be broadcasting your own information online, but you’re not 
the only one contributing to your online persona. Organizations, governments, 
friends, family, and media are also out there exposing you every day. In this sec-
tion we look at the various sources exposing you online.
You Did It Yourself
The Internet’s function of self-publication has revolutionized the way that 
humans communicate with each other. If you don’t believe that, spend a day 
with a teenager and see how she uses social media, text messaging, instant mes-
saging, and Skype video communication to stay in touch with friends both near 
and far.
But like all revolutions, the Internet communication revolution includes 
a negative side. Anyone who participates fully in social media, blogs, and the 
opportunity to comment on favorite websites is revealing much to the world. 
The person exposing most of your personal information online is probably you.
The Internet sites and tools discussed in this chapter are not the only ways 
to display yourself on the Internet. The Web contains millions of places you 
can publish information about yourself using a variety of technologies, with 
more appearing every day. Not surprisingly, there are very few tools to teach you 
self-censorship.
By posting a picture on the Internet and identifying yourself, you have 
just provided information about your age, gender, race, your health, your social 
class, your self-esteem, and your tastes. You may have included an image of your 
home, a favorite vacation spot, your car, or family members or friends, revealing 
even more about your life. Videos that you post may only multiply the exposure.
One Example: Facebook

there is a strong probability that you have flashed the world with your Facebook

page. As of this writing, Facebook is claiming more than one and a half billion 
current active users. A current active user is a person with a Facebook page who 
has visited the site within the past month. Given those numbers, there are more 
than twice as many Facebook users than the total populations of the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada combined.
What is this staggering number of people doing at a single Internet site? 
They are posting information about themselves and reading and responding to 
information posted by other people. Facebook continues to add new tools to 
help you provide more information about yourself to anyone interested in learn-
ing about you.
The growth of photo and video posting is also astronomical. Facebook 
claims that its current daily photograph uploads average 360 million.9
Facebook includes a place to write messages viewable by everyone, includ-
ing messages to small groups and messages that can be seen by just one person. 
Hundreds of millions of conversations on Facebook happen out in the open for 
everyone to read.
Facebook can also help people locate you at any time. The service offers a 
tool for you to tell the system exactly where you are standing at that moment—at 
the grocery store, on vacation in Bali, attending the soccer game, or at home in 
your kitchen—so that all of your Facebook friends, or all 1.5 billion and growing 
Facebook users, depending on your privacy settings, can discover your physical 
location. Criminals can even use the collected location data to understand your 
daily routine—for example, when you leave your house for work or when you 
buy groceries each week. This ability to locate anyone may seem offensive or 
intriguing to you, but when you think of someone knowing your child’s every 
move, it’s a use of technology that becomes frightening.
The bottom line: If you choose to accept all of the offered Facebook invita-
tions to share information, many of the important facts, routines, people, and 
passions in your life will be available to millions of people.
Expressing Yourself in Comments
Spotlighting your own life on social networks is not the only way that you 
expose yourself online. Many commercial Internet sites have comment features 
that allow visitors to post opinions and responses. You could be singing the 
praises of the most comfortable pair of shoes you have ever owned or looking for 
sympathy on a relationship site because you just broke up with your boyfriend.
Your postings may include Amazon book or music reviews, or they may 
be political statements on the Fox News website or on Huffington Post. Your 
responses may be on the website of your favorite sports team or the ESPN page 
discussing your team’s greatest rival. You may say positive or negative things 
about a public company on message boards tied to the performance of that

company’s stock price, or you may be commenting on a friend’s loud Hawaiian 
shirt in weekend party pictures.
Whatever you say and wherever you post your comments, you expose your 
opinions, ideas, and thought processes to billions of people. Many of these posts 
are made under pseudonyms or “handles” that are not easy to trace back to you. 
However, it is possible to decipher who owns a handle, and keep in mind that 
anyone who learns your handle for posting on a specific website can learn a great 
deal about how you think and information about your life. (We discuss later in 
this book how uncovering a handle on social websites may be much easier than 
you think.)
Finally, the mother of all online comments is the blog. Publishing your 
own blog is similar to writing an updated page on a social media site, except 
the blog tends to focus on an area of interest and provides detailed analysis of 
your thinking on the subject. Many blogs are updated every day, and most well-
known blogs include at least two new entries a week. A constant stream of words 
on nearly any subject can tell the world about your thinking process and prob-
ably leave clues about your work or home life. A blog often is little more than 
a lengthy online comment that includes thousands of words of self-revelation.
At the beginning of this chapter we discussed the blog of the Washingtoni-
enne. Her blog is not an isolated phenomenon. According to Wordpress’s web-
site, in 2016 more than 409 million people viewed more than 21.5 billion blog 
pages each month, and Wordpress bloggers produce about 55.8 million new 
posts each month. These are just a small fraction of online content that can be 
classified as blogging. These Internet publications could be the random mus-
ings of madmen, detailed discussion of politics or technological products, or the 
growing phenomenon of mommy blogging—providing tips, product reviews, 
and shopping deals for raising kids in a specific location. 
Twitter is a tool for microblogging, blogs that have a limited number of 
characters of text per posting. The Twitter technology allows pictures and small 
text messages to be posted online and sent directly to anyone who “follows you” 
on Twitter. Whereas some people use Twitter to post details on their daily com-
mute and every mundane thought that enters their brains, others use the tech-
nology to organize political rallies, to call attention to the everyday movements 
of celebrities, or to lead teams on scavenger hunts. Twitter may be intrusive and 
pervasive, revealing everything about the writer from his or her deepest thoughts 
to up-to-the-minute location data.
Finally, you could be exposing your personal habits to others based only on 
the type of websites you frequent. The Internet offers interest-specific sites for 
stamp collectors, rugby players, and people who suffer from rare skin diseases. 
The fact that you have chosen to spend your time or become a member of any of 
these sites can speak volumes about you. In 2015, the Ashley Madison website

was hacked and the names of people who had paid accounts on the site was 
published. Many of those people were humiliated or suffered significant trouble 
in their personal lives because of their exposure as Ashley Madison community 
members. This is because it is a website created for a person looking to cheat 
on his spouse to meet a partner who also wants to cheat on her spouse. Self-
identifying publicly as an Ashley Madison member was akin to an announce-
ment of attempted infidelity or worse. Website associations can speak volumes 
about you.
The Circle Widens: How Others Expose You
Posting information about yourself is entirely within your own control, but 
much of the information about you on the Internet is put there by someone else. 
As more of the world’s data moves to the Web, information about you is prob-
ably part of it, often appearing where you least expect it.
Your friends, rivals, family, teachers, employers, church, and other connec-
tions may post information about you that others can see. Clubs are proud that 
you are a member, and businesses are pleased that you are a customer. These 
and other organizations and individuals may promote their associations with 
you online.
Exposure by Friends
Often without intending to, friends and family may be giving away your 
personal information. Once again, Facebook offers an example of how even well-
meaning friends can expose you online. Facebook, as well as dozens of photog-
raphy sites, offers digital tools that allow a user to post a photograph and then to 
“tag” all of the people in the picture. Tagging provides not only people’s names 
but also links from the picture to the Facebook pages of all the people in the pho-
tograph. Your Facebook page will include links to any pictures posted by others 
in which you are tagged. These pictures may be embarrassing if they are reviewed 
by your boss, or they may show potential thieves where you live or the license 
plate of your car. You have little control over the picture’s availability online.
But social networking sites aren’t the only place others may expose you. 
Your grandmother may post your family tree on a genealogy site, giving an ID 
thief your mother’s maiden name (often used as a password verification ques-
tion) and much more. Your friend may send an e-mail to others telling them of 
your surprise party Friday night, along with your address and phone number. 
Anyone who knows you can post your information for all to see.
Being tagged in your friend’s pictures can be fun, but it may also show a dif-
ferent side of you than you want exposed to the general public. How easy will it 
be for a future employer to find the wild party pictures from your friend’s pages?

How Organizations and Your Employer Expose You
Your name, description, and picture are also likely to appear online if you 
serve on the board of an organization or are an active member at your local place 
of worship or community theater. These articles or images often give your name, 
so anybody can find them in Bing and Google searches. For example, while 
the United Nations Foundation is understandably proud that media mogul 
Ted Turner and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan serve on their board, the 
I n f o r m a t i o n  P e r m a n e n c e
Once information gets online, however it got there, different online entities 
may archive it for a long time. Although everyone knows about using search 
engines racing over the Internet to find available information, not many 
people understand the breadth and depth of current archiving projects. For 
example, Archives.com has collected a database of information commonly 
used for genealogy research, from birth and death records to family history 
and immigration certificates. Genealogy is a growing industry, so many 
other sites, including Ancestry.com, Familysearch.org, and Tribalpages.com 
provide similar services.
Google is the most active archiving company. Google is involved in a fa-
mous project to create searchable archives of all books printed in the history 
of humankind. Google also archives the physical structures of the world. 
The famous “Satellite” function on Google Maps allows prospective thieves 
to see the entire layout of your street and your property. If they have mapped 
your town, the Google Street View project also allows anyone in the world 
to look directly at your house from the street, and then see a 360-degree view 
around your neighborhood—the same view that you would see if you drove 
down your street and looked all around.
Google has also created the largest online archive of Holocaust 
photographs, an archive of Life magazine pictures, collections of the Prado 
Museum in Madrid, and the New York Public Library’s historical postcard 
collection. Aside from the collections of images, videos, and maps it collects 
from the current Internet, Google also displays searchable patent archives 
and high-resolution digital images of historical maps from the David Rum-
sey Collection. These many and varied sources illustrate the fact that Google 
and other companies are taking information that was once only available in 
paper form and making that information searchable online.

website for the foundation includes their pictures and biographies as well as 
those of eleven other board members.
This practice is common for nonprofit entities. Volunteer organizations 
you’re involved with aren’t the only ones exposing you. Check out your employ-
er’s or school’s website and you may find more information posted there than 
you are comfortable with, from your biography or résumé to a note about your 
participation in an upcoming, out-of-town conference.
Your Own Government Is Stripping You Naked
The vast majority of housing records within the United States have always 
been public information available to anyone. In the 1970s, a person looking up 
real estate records would have had to physically travel to the county recorder’s 
office for each county that contained property he wanted to learn about. Once 
there, he would be directed to a back room filled with dusty, thirty-pound plat 
books to find one set of information and an entirely different set of books to find 
other types of information. The process was slow, laborious, and difficult. Now 
many U.S. counties keep their property records online so that any researcher 
can quickly run multiple record review requests from the comfort of his office 
or living room, discovering anything from what you paid for your house to the 
amount of your mortgage and your yearly income.
In addition to property records, the trend on public government sites is to 
keep updated information about current enforcement of laws and regulations but 
to maintain older data and press releases as well. Birth and death records, real 
estate transactions, arrests, convictions and traffic violations, marriage records, 
and nearly every other brush with public officials is recorded and posted. Local, 
state, and federal governments all keep public records. Testimony before Con-
gress is online, hearings before many federal executive commissions are on the 
Internet, and so are the comments stated before local school boards and zon-
ing commissions. Government sites, from courts to administrative agencies, 
treat their Internet sites as historical records, so they keep most information 
indefinitely.
One of the most embarrassing databases to move online is the database con-
taining the records and opinions of court cases. Court proceedings have always 
been official public records, but now researchers and acquaintances can quickly 
and easily find out about your bankruptcy proceedings, your dispute with a for-
mer business partner, and maybe even your divorce settlement. These records 
show us at our worst and most stressful moments, and thanks to the govern-
ment’s embrace of the Internet, they are becoming much simpler to search and 
explore.
And some records last forever online. The FBI offers a sex offender registry 
where anyone can look up their own neighborhood and find people convicted of 
www.ebook3000.com

HOW WERE YOU EXPOSED?
19
sex crimes. But other crimes are publicized as well. The state of Virginia offers 
names of everyone who was in the care of the state Department of Corrections 
for any crime. You do not even need to be convicted of a crime for this trend 
to affect you. For example, several public records sites offer mugshot databases 
that expose people who have been arrested for crimes. Once your mugshot is 
available online, people may quickly make up their minds about your character.
Exposure by Media
Newspapers were created to disseminate the important information of the 
day, including local news. They also discuss human-interest events such as wed-
dings, funerals, and professional milestones such as job changes and promotions. 
Since the founding of the United States through the mid-1990s, newspapers 
have been an important source of information, but the notoriety only lasted for 
a day and then was relegated to the basement archives of the newspaper’s offices. 
Only an intrepid researcher could fight through the dust to find paper copies or 
microfiche of each day’s events.
Now not only are entire newspaper archives online, stretching back over 
decades, but the information in these papers is also searchable. Today a con 
artist or private investigator need only list the topics or person he is seeking, 
and any relevant articles or photos appear on the screen. No travel, no dust, no 
guessing—just answers.
Newspapers have jumped online in a big way. For example, Tampabay.com, 
the online site for the Saint Petersburg Times in Florida, allows visitors to its 
website to search its own archives back as far as 1987. Any news from West 
Central Florida for more than twenty years can be searched and displayed. If you 
were arrested in that town on spring break ten years ago, your ignominy will live 
forever in easily searchable newspaper text.
Aggregation search sites like Google go much further. In a single search, 
Google allows the researcher to look for topics covered by hundreds of news-
papers back as far as 1901. Then the user can sort the results by relevance or by 
date. Google continues to add more newspaper and publication archives to this 
search function so that anyone can find news about you or quotes attributed to 
you from within news stories in newspapers throughout the world.
Of course, newspapers aren’t the only media you can search online. If you 
appear on local or national TV or radio, that appearance could be searchable 
online. Strictly online news sources such as Huffington Post and MSN are also 
searchable. Whatever the media, its content is often indexed or archived some-
where on the Internet.
The Internet has spawned new types of media that can also add to your 
online persona. There is an entire category of websites that take pictures at par-
ties, bars, and nightclubs and post them so we know who is attending the hot 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
20
spots. Another cottage industry on the Internet consists of sites that publish 
photographs of celebrities and everyone seen with them. Like the newspaper 
society pages before them, these sites often identify the people in their pictures. 
The photographs and text can be searched, so you could be adding information 
to your online persona by attending the symphony fund-raiser or the hottest 
dance club in town and posing for pictures.
Now That You Know You’re Naked, 
How Do You Get Dressed?
The Internet facilitates the greatest collection of information that has ever 
existed, and it is pushing deeper into data about our private homes, businesses, 
families, and lives. Sometimes we add to this information stream ourselves, and 
sometimes others enter information about us, but either way, the list grows 
longer and easier to access.
In the next chapter, we examine who is searching for information about you 
and what they want to know. Later chapters in this book address how to man-
age your online persona and constructively correct misleading or embarrassing 
information marring your Internet image. As you continue reading, you will 
learn what information affects you, your family, and your business, and what you 
can do to take control of your online data and reputation.

Peekers and Gawkers
Who’s Looking at Your Online Persona?
I
n May 2013 when the media reported that Edward Snowden had revealed 
information regarding digital surveillance programs around the world, citi-
zens everywhere began to wonder who was looking at them and exactly what 
could they see.
We all have secrets or personal experiences we keep to ourselves or may 
share with a trusted circle of confidants but would be mortified if those secrets 
were exposed to the world. This begs the question, who would want to expose 
our private information, and what’s in it for them? We know that third-party 
marketing firms are collecting every click and every piece of information we 
provide online. We also have resigned ourselves to the fact that our neighbors, 
friends, lovers, and prospective employers are going to “Google” us. Each com-
pany, organization, and person searching the Web may capture, preserve, and 
display facts about our lives that we might never reveal in a face-to-face conver-
sation. In this chapter we run through the inventory of the types of individuals 
and organizations interested in you and how they might use your information in 
ways both legal and illegal.
Surveillance Center Stage
As the Edward Snowden story unfolded, many came to realize that some of the 
data involved were collected by private sector companies. Over the past fifteen 
years, although many countries have different definitions of what “privacy” 
means for their citizens, they have mostly agreed to disagree. The confluence of 
the Snowden revelations coupled with a lawsuit by an Austrian student, and the 
continued breaches of consumer data have led governments around the world to 
redefine what privacy means. They have also demanded greater accountability 
and protections for those companies that collect data about their citizens.
The European Court of Justice, considered the highest court in Europe, has 
canceled an agreement dating back to the year 2000. That accord permitted U.S. 
technology companies to collect information and allowed for digital data flow

outside the geography of Europe using voluntary frameworks and rules on pri-
vacy. The United States and European Union are working on a “privacy shield” 
to replace the invalidated safe harbour.1
The case that drove this decision was filed by Mr. Max Schrems. Schrems 
is an Austrian graduate student who believed that Facebook sent his data to the 
U.S. National Security Agency. His case asked that the data protection commis-
sioner of the European Union forbid Facebook from sending his personal data 
to the U.S. government. Before this landmark case, many governments agreed 
to a “safe harbor” agreement between their country and Europe, and the United 
States enjoyed this agreement as part of its overall design for protection of the 
privacy of EU citizens.2
Mark your calendar for January 28. For more than ten years now, about the 
same time that Google Maps was introduced, twenty-seven countries across the 
European Union, Canada, and the United States have reserved that day as Data 
Privacy and Protection Day.
Growing Concern
According to recent surveys, citizens around the globe are concerned about their 
privacy but are not sure what to do about it. The Rand Corporation conducted 
a study and found that, across twenty-seven European Union countries, people 
want more privacy measures in place.3 Many Europeans will shop around for an 
Internet service provider (ISP), until they find one with privacy features built 
into their service.
The top three features Europeans look for are:
1.  The ISP can and will actively hide data regarding the user’s Internet use.
2.  The ISP notifies its users about websites that do not meet their desired 
level of privacy.
3.  The ISP provides practical advice on how to anonymously surf the 
Web without falling prey to website data collection techniques.
Pew Internet Survey results from 2015 indicated that:4
•  Ninety-three percent of adults want to be in control of who can access 
and see their data.
•  Ninety percent want to control the information collected about them.
•  Eighty-eight percent of U.S. citizens responding to the survey also said 
they do not want to be observed digitally without prior consent.
Sixty-five percent of those Americans surveyed said there are not enough limits 
on the data that the government can collect about them from their Internet or

phone traffic. Despite the frequency of credit card breaches, Americans evidently 
trust the credit card companies more than the government to keep their personal 
details private: 9 percent felt credit card companies could keep their data private 
and secure but only 6 percent thought that government agencies could.

Who Is Trying to Look at You Online?
When you are naked (literally or figuratively), it might be a good idea to know 
who is taking a peek. Certainly there are people who look at others online out 
of curiosity or to seek titillation. The Ashley Madison hackers dumped infor-
mation, such as names and e-mails, on the Web for anyone to search and see. 
The information that data thieves dump on the Internet for the world to search 
and see can range from the sensational, such as the Ashley Madison case, to the 
mundane, such as data that are already a part of public record. Everybody from 
your employer to criminals and spies are also out there, just dying to develop a 
relationship with your mobile device, computer, your connections, your infor-
mation, your identity, and your money.
In a study led by Microsoft, twelve countries were surveyed regarding mod-
ern technology’s impact on society. In eleven of the twelve countries surveyed, 
respondents said privacy has been negatively impacted by modern technology. 
The only country where people didn’t feel that way was India. Most respondents 
added that international and local laws have kept pace to protect their personal 
information.6
Anybody can use the information you’ve left behind to uncover your secrets 
to hurt you or judge you in ways that may cost you a job, a relationship, your pride, 
or your reputation. Want to know who is looking? Your school or employer. A 
competitor. A stalker. An identity thief. Your future wife. The FBI. When it 
comes to your information online, your motto could be “suspect everyone.”
Despite the salacious stories and media attention, criminals may be the least 
of your worries. The fact is that most people who are looking at your Internet 
identity already have a relationship with you: a friend, creditor, potential lover, 
insurer, the tax collector, future or current employer, law enforcement officer, 
or your government.
To figure out who might be looking at you, think of the primary and sec-
ondary relationships in your life, both formal and informal. Casual searches or 
deep, online investigations tend to be started by:
•  those considering a financial relationship with you, such as a car or mort-
gage lender, your insurance company, your bank, or current employer;

Protecting Your Internet Identity
24
•  businesses that want to tailor marketing and advertising, or that want 
to resell your data to data brokers. These companies may also use your 
behaviors to design, develop, and refine new products or to detect your 
human behaviors (for example, your spending patterns);
•  people concerned about your reputation, such as your fiancé, potential 
employer, or school admissions officer;
•  those who want to hide behind your face or reputation for their own 
personal gain;
•  retail stores where you shop; and
•  people who want to know more about you to bully you, sell to you, or 
steal from you.
So, who is watching and possibly tracking you? What are their motives? 
What methods do they use? Let’s take a look.
The Workplace: Who Might Be Looking 
Over Your Shoulder?
Many of us put in long hours and spend time working nights, weekends, and 
holidays for our employers. Our jobs eat up so much of our personal time that 
we work during our personal time and take care of personal stuff during work-
ing hours: a quick purchase online, checking personal e-mail to see if your home 
mortgage will be refinanced, or ordering flowers for a sick loved one. Most of us 
simply do not have another way to juggle it all.
If you’ve worked for a company for a while, it’s likely that your boss is aware 
that your online usage doesn’t interfere with your work and you’re not at risk. 
However, when that new manager comes in or the company takeover brings new 
policies with it, things could change. It’s important that you are aware that your 
employer has a right to watch your Web habits.
A Quick Lesson in How to Get Fired
You may tend to think of your life in compartments: there’s your family 
life, your life at work, and your social life. Though these compartments overlap 
at times, you probably think that what you do when you are not at work is your 
own business. To some extent that’s true, but the lines have become blurred in 
the social networking era.
You carry personal digital devices in your purse or on your belt, and your 
employer may even provide devices such as a company laptop to get 24/7 digital 
access to you. More and more, employers are watching what their employees do 
“off the clock” because they see it as a reflection of their company’s brand or an 
absolute necessity to protect company customers and intellectual property.

Recently, six HSBC bankers in Birmingham, England, created a video of a 
mock ISIS beheading. The video was posted on Instagram. The bankers in the 
video were promptly fired. A high school teacher from the Bronx, New York, 
Chadwin Reynolds, was fired for friending female students on Facebook. After 
friending the young ladies, he posted comments such as “this is sexy” under their 
Facebook photo posts.7
In the United States, courts have often sided with employers in holding that, 
at least for an at-will employee, negative work comments online can be grounds 
for termination. However, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has 
provided some clarity on this topic. The NLRB ruled that a YouTube video 
made by construction workers to highlight unsafe work conditions was pro-
tected. If your social media posts about work focus on issues with pay or working 
conditions, your comment may be protected by U.S. labor laws, however, the 
NLRB has warned that venting about your boss and your boss’s annoying habits 
is most likely not protected. Make sure you refer to your employer’s social media 
policy in your employee handbook before you discuss where you work and say 
anything about your employer, positive or negative.8
All the Wrong Moves
What, exactly, could you do online that could cause you to lose your job? 
Here’s just a partial listing:
•  Make racist or sexist comments about your employer or coworkers.
•  Mix friends and work: Sending out posts indiscriminately to both 
friends and coworkers could lead to oversharing or annoying one or 
both sets of people you know. Consider maintaining separate lists 
for social networking posts, one personal and one professional. You 
can even create more than one account on networks such as Twitter. 
Google+, a Facebook competitor, allows you to create small and large 
circles of people you know that will make it even easier to keep your 
posts specific to the most appropriate audience.
•  Upload pictures and posts: A picture of you drunk on your Facebook 
page may seem funny at the time, but don’t forget to look at it from 
your current or future boss’s point of view. Posting a comment about 
how silly and ridiculous your all-day staff meeting was is a really bad 
idea. A good rule of thumb: If you are thinking of posting something 
shocking or in bad taste, spend a minute in your boss’s or mother’s 
shoes before you do.
•  Share secrets: Sharing sensitive or confidential information, if dis-
covered by your employer, is definitely going to get you fired and 
you might even be prosecuted. Bragging about a special project you 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
26
are assigned to is not only bad manners but also a breach of trust. A 
Microsoft employee bragged about details of an upcoming version 
of Windows. That kind of indiscretion could prove devastating if 
hackers were able to design new attacks that would be ready the day 
the next version of Windows is released, and so the employee was 
fired. Releasing inside product information from a public company 
could also be a securities law violation.
•  Bad-mouth: Openly complaining on social media sites about how 
much you hate your job is a bad idea. Do not blog, e-mail, or post on 
social sites that your coworkers are inane, your boss does not have a 
clue, or your job is soooo boring. These comments can easily get back 
to your workplace.
•  Play public hooky: Calling in “sick” when you are not is common 
enough and an integrity issue that we will leave up to your judgment. 
But if you spend your “sick” day at the beach, don’t take date-stamped 
pictures of you prancing around in your bikini and then post them 
online. One woman called in sick to her employer, Nationale Suisse, 
saying she had a headache and could not work at a computer because 
the light hurt her eyes. However, she did manage to check posts on her 
Facebook page. They fired her. She contends she did nothing wrong 
and that she used a smartphone, not her computer, to check her posts.9
•  Overshare: A woman was dismissed from jury duty after posting that 
she was conflicted, did not know how to decide the verdict, and that 
she was taking a poll via Facebook.
•  Vent inappropriately and unprofessionally: One teacher lost her job 
because she had created a blog, wrote anonymously, and posted her 
negative feelings about her school day, the kids, and more. She never 
named the students, but someone found the site, alerted her employer, 
and she was suspended with pay.
How Employers Use Your Information
Sixty-six percent of all employers that responded to a survey from the 
American Management Association said they monitor their employees’ Internet 
connections when they are using a work computer or an office Internet con-
nection.10 Today, social media is regularly used to look into your background 
before an employer even meets you. Many recruiting professionals say that social 
recruiting is now the primary source of getting to know potential candidates. 
In a 2014 survey, 93 percent of recruiters used or planned to use information 
gathered from social media to support their recruiting efforts. According to the 
same survey, recruiters primarily surfed LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, 
RSS feeds, and YouTube.11

If you log into your employer’s network while on a business trip to check 
your business e-mail and send a résumé to a headhunter while you’re at it, your 
current employers could see that. If they do, you might kiss your current job 
goodbye.
Employers use your information in several ways, including:
•  Keeping tabs on your reputation: employers use the Internet to recruit, 
do background checks, find out with whom you associate, and more. 
Once you are hired, you have to stay disciplined about your life online 
because they will still be checking.
•  Hiring, firing, and rejecting: Statistics indicate that recruiters are us-
ing new methods to find people to interview and to check out their 
backgrounds and habits.12 They look at Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, 
and blogs. Microsoft and Cross-Tab conducted a study and found that 
human resource professionals have rejected candidates based on what 
they found online.
•  In the United States, 48 percent of employers rejected a candidate 
because of social media posts. In the United Kingdom, 68 percent of 
employers rejected a candidate specifically as a result of their social 
media postings. Twenty-four percent of employers gave warnings to 
current employees as a result of their social media posts. But there’s also 
a flip side: 15 percent were suspicious of a candidate that had no visible 
social media presence.13
Do you think your employer should notify you about these practices? Think 
again. Many people assume that employers must disclose their practices if they 
are monitoring their employees’ Internet traffic and e-mail closely. In fact, in the 
United States only Delaware and Connecticut require employers to notify their 
employees that they are conducting electronic monitoring and surveillance.14
Because of the importance many employers place on Internet and social 
media reviews in hiring and employment considerations, companies like Social 
Intelligence Corporation make a business of running these checks on a com-
pany’s behalf and only reporting certain results back to the human resources 
department. This service allows a curious employer to run an Internet check 
without subjecting itself to claims of employment discrimination. A new indus-
try is rising from the business interest in your online persona.
Some information about you can be used to create risk scores that could 
be used in hiring decisions. The nonprofit organization, World Privacy Forum 
released findings that various third-party firms and companies have created 
“secret” consumer scores that rank you on everything from the likelihood you 
will keep your job to how likely you are to commit fraud. One company sells a 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
28
score that uses employment and unemployment data, as well as economic trends 
and forecasts to predict the probability that you will lose your job, and, as a 
result, not be able to pay your bills.15
Your employer may or may not know the details behind your risky score but 
the Internet knows all and never forgets. In the interest of self-protection and 
not knowingly violating existing laws, many employers prefer to know which 
candidates would be costly to employ, even if they don’t know the specifics. 
Although they do not need to find high-tech solutions to do so, using external 
scoring leaves employers less vulnerable to questions about their hiring practices, 
particularly if they don’t appear to be actively looking for medical issues.16
Clients See You, Too
Do you wonder why your biggest client took his or her business and walked away 
last year? Sometimes a client might not hire you in the first place, and you’re not 
really sure why. Or you could have a long and profitable relationship, and one 
slip or careless post could leave you without a client.

According to a story from Eric J. Sinrod on CNET from May 30, 2007, 
David Mullins was fired from his job as facilities engineering technician for 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Forecast 
Office in Indianapolis. He filed a claim against his former employer stating 
that his supervisor was improperly prejudiced against him when she “Google 
searched” his name and discovered that he had been terminated from his 
previous job with the U.S. Air Force. Mr. Mullins’s supervisor ran an Inter-
net search and found this information: “In 1996, the Department of the Air 
Force removed [Mr. Mullins] from a civil service position and that in 1997, 
the Smithsonian Institution told [Mr. Mullins] to ‘look for a new job.’”
Mr. Mullins claimed that such a search into his past, and subsequent 
termination of his federal employment based on the search, was improper 
under U.S. civil service rules. The board hearing his case, and the Appeals 
Court in review, left this question open, finding that he was properly let go 
for other reasons. Yet his supervisor clearly looked up Mr. Mullins’s history 
online and her findings could easily have played a role in his firing.

Look at the situation that comedian Gilbert Gottfried, the iconic voice of the 
Aflac duck, encountered. He posted offensive and inappropriate tweets regarding 
the Japanese earthquake and tsunami crisis. After those tweets gained the atten-
tion of the press, Aflac terminated their relationship with him. Aflac’s senior vice 
president and chief marketing officer, Michael Zuna, said in a company state-
ment, “Gilbert’s recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor 
and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac. Aflac 
Japan—and, by extension, Japan itself—is part of the Aflac family, and there is 
no place for anything but compassion and concern during these difficult times.”
A media company lost their client, Chrysler, over a tweet. An employee of

how to (expletive removed) drive.” That employee cost New Media Strategies 
a client.17
Where You Shop: Who Might Be Looking 
Over Your Shoulder?
We expect to get help when shopping, but we may not realize that we are being 
watched by those who provide that help. Surveillance of shoppers is nothing 
new. Many retail outlets observe shoppers to see who might need help, identify 
the times of day that require more or less staff, or offer you just-in-time special 
offers on your phone when you connect to WiFi. But did you know that many 
of the stores that you visit are photographing; they may or may not keep those 
photos on file.
Several retailers, in an effort to fight crime, are using facial recognition 
technology. Walmart has been testing technology that may help them identify 
shoplifters in their stores.18
If a face matches a database of a shoplifter, the system alerts security. The 
problem with this is that facial recognition technology is not perfect, and some 
of us have doppelgangers. It’s also possible that in the future, at the payment 
terminal, stores may scan your face and match it up to social media posts and 
other sources to validate your identity. Though this may sound like a great way 
to protect your identity, what happens if that database, storing your facial rec-
ognition photos and tied to your credit card, is hacked?
What should the expected privacy policy be in these cases? No customer is 
asked to review a store’s privacy policy and click on “ok” before they enter the 
store. Still, what happens in these brick-and-mortar encounters can draw infor-
mation about you from the Internet, and post information about your shopping 
activities for others to view. If you think you’re not “naked online” because you’re 
careful or “off the grid,” think again.

People in Your Personal Life
Quite often it is somebody you know in your personal life who exposes or uses 
your personal information in ways that can harm you. Here’s the rundown of 
relationships you might want to review with this in mind.
Parents Are Watching
Social networking sites, e-mails, and texting are a great way to stay con-
nected to family members. Some parents keep up with what their kids are doing 
online, which is the responsible thing to do. Sometimes kids see this as intrusive 
surveillance, so be sure you set ground rules early on, the younger the better. Try 
to make your kids feel that you want to share their experience of learning about 
the Internet just as you help them with homework, and not to invade their pri-
vacy. One mom regularly logged into her sixteen-year-old son’s profile on Face-
book to make sure he was following the home rules. One day while checking his 
page, she did not like his posts, so she removed them and changed his password.
The son got upset and filed a complaint with prosecutors, who agreed to 
hear his case against his mom under the state’s harassment law.
Kids Watch, Too
Don’t forget that your kids are watching you and other family members 
online, too. They are searching social networking sites to see what their parents 
post. Some kids are using social networking sites to find and reconnect with a 
parent they may have been alienated from as a result of divorce or other family 
changes. Some kids are searching their parents’ posts to justify what they post, 
so if you post anything online, be sure you are the role model for the behavior 
you espouse.
If your child tends to be disrespectful to any family member, make sure you 
monitor their online communications with those family members. The elderly, 
especially grandparents, are often considered weaker and may be the target of the 
family bully. Kids may use social networking and texting to abuse their grand-
parents or to bully grandparents into giving them money or covering for the kids 
when they get in trouble.
Best Friends Forever (BFF): Friends Online
Your friends could inadvertently expose your information in their own 
online postings or through online activities such as social networking or gene-
alogy. Also, relationships change, and a friend today could turn on you as a 
cyberbully tomorrow.
But it may not just be your current set of friends exposing you. It used to be 
that when you grew up and moved away from home, you had the opportunity

to make new friends and only keep up with old friends if you wanted to. Now, 
on the Internet, you could be reconnecting with people you want to and with 
those who you would rather forget. There are TV and radio ads that encourage 
you to find old friends or former loves online. There are, in fact, many websites 
dedicated to helping people find other people. Just as you might have brushed 
off such a person who called you out of the blue in the past, you have to learn 
how to manage who you do and do not want to associate with online.
Prospective Mates and Spouses Are Watching
Unearthing information that used to take families lots of money, several 
months, and a professional investigator might be just a few minutes and mouse 
clicks away today. You might be the one to perform such research or be the 
subject of research by others. Worried that your mom’s new boyfriend is really 
after your deceased dad’s bank account? Start surfing the Net to learn more. Is 
Mr. Wonderful starry-eyed in love with you, but some of your facts and stories 
don’t quite add up? You might be in for a nasty surprise when he breaks the 
engagement.
Here’s one example of what a spouse might find out online. A woman 
from Ohio suspected something might be wrong with her relationship with her 
husband. She went to Facebook, typed away, and found her husband appear-
ing handsome and happy on his wedding day. He looked fabulous, and he had 
posted roughly two hundred photos online. Sounds good so far; the only prob-
lem was that the bride was somebody else.19
Criminals
Criminals go where the action is, and there is currently a lot of action online. 
Criminals used to case a bank or cruise around looking for victims, but today 
they find it far more efficient and effective to conduct some or all of their unsa-
vory research online. They have many methods of finding you, watching you, 
and tracking you online. They surf social networking sites, chat rooms, and 
gaming sites. They also have mastered techniques for looking like a legitimate 
company, friend, or associate online. They use information they have discovered 
about you to implement tactics that gain your trust, and they try to trick you into 
clicking on a link or giving up information you wouldn’t hand over to a stranger.
Cybercrime is a global issue that is on the rise. It will continue to be attrac-
tive to thieves until strict laws are put into place and there is transnational 
cooperation among governments, international law enforcement agencies, and 
international court systems. The free and open Internet that has been the fuel 
behind growth, innovation, and removal of barriers could become severely dam-
aged by rampant unresolved crime.

The types of crimes listed in this book are just a sample of what’s happening 
to innocent victims around the globe.
Social Engineers
Did you know that many security breaches have been attributed to human 
error?20 Almost 95 percent of breaches recently in the headlines are attributable 
to human error and 78 percent of those breaches involved tricking the user rather 
than using technology. If the bad guys can trick people who are trained to be on 
high alert, what does that mean for the rest of us?21
Social engineering is a popular tool of the trade for both offline and Internet 
criminals. This tactic involves gathering information about you to take advan-
tage of you. Criminals may purchase information from other criminals following 
a data breach or they may go to free, online records, databases, and social media 
to acquire the information.
What do they look for? Information they can use such as your home-
town, favorite hobbies, high school mascot, and family member names. Then, 
they use that information to gain your confidence and trust. This happens 
on social networking sites, dating sites, in e-mail messages, text messages, 
gaming sites, and phony websites that download malware to your computer 
with every click.
Most people leave a treasure trove of clues for criminals who are planning 
to commit social engineering crimes or physical robberies. A ring of robbers in 
New Hampshire used Facebook to determine what homes would be vacant and 
how to plan their robberies. If you’re leaving enough information around online, 
social engineers might use it to deceive you, stalk you, or rob your home.
According to Dr. Sally Leivesley, former Home Office scientific adviser in 
the United Kingdom, “What we need is an international agreement between 
all the [United Nations] countries. You have to have a respected highly 
intelligent body, paid for by the UN to monitor and advise a specific group 
within the UN when breaches have occurred.”*

Clicking Your Way to Trouble
Criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated at taking information 
from your Internet identity to convince you to click on links, open attachments, 
or fill out forms that give them the information they need to take over your 
computer or your online identity.
E-mail Alert
When you get those annoying e-mails about drugs you do not want to buy 
or e-mails from vendors you don’t do business with, it’s possible that you are 
being spammed. By clicking a link or attachment in the spam e-mail, you might 
just be downloading malware. Malware is malicious software that is downloaded 
to your computer or other device. Criminals use malware for many purposes, 
but the basic intent is to follow you around online so they can collect informa-
tion about you or to gain access to information or damage data stored on your 
computer.
Some criminals create programs that “wake up” to steal your account ID 
and password when you log into an online banking site. Some criminals create 
programs that use your own address book to send out spam to your friends using 
your name, hoping to pull in more victims.
You may accidentally click on what you think looks like a virus software 
update, also known as shareware. This invites criminals right into your com-
puter. Shareware criminal rings are big business in the Internet world. The FBI, 
in coordination with many other countries, was able to bust up two cybergangs 
using scareware to steal over $74 million.
Pay the Ransom
A popular scheme today is the use of ransomware, which cybercriminals 
employ to infect your computer or the network of a company. They silently track 
your files to determine which data might be most valuable to you. When the 
cybercriminals strike, they encrypt important files and threaten you: If you don’t 
pay their ransom, they won’t unlock your files and in some cases, they threaten 
to destroy the files.
Use of ransomware was up more than 100 percent in 2014 from 2013. Many 
security and law enforcement experts believe this number is too low because vic-
tims often pay the ransom and don’t report it. Security software firm Symantec 
estimates that at least $5 million was paid by people and companies responding 
to ransom e-mails each year and payment of ransoms by victims is now on the 
rise.22
The FBI has estimated that roughly $27 million in ransom demands were 
paid just for the victims infected with the CryptoLocker virus during the months 
of September 2013 through May 2014.23

Protecting Your Internet Identity
34
Thankfully, security firms eventually find a fix for each instance of ransom-
ware, but the scheme is so lucrative that cybercriminals develop new approaches 
designed to get around the defenses of security products such as antimalware 
and antivirus software.
Smishing
While phishing e-mails that pretend to be from a source such as your bank 
are commonplace, smishing is moving up on the list of Internet crimes that 
involve text messaging. Smishing is a phishing message sent via SMS messaging, 
which is typically available on most mobile phones and tablet devices. One click 
on that smishing message could infect your phone and allow criminals to peek 
at your address book and surfing activity.
A 2014 report by EMC indicated that all phishing scams are costly. Roughly 
$5.9 billion was spent recovering from 500,000 attacks.24
There are seven steps to getting your account back from phishing cyber-
criminals or preventing cybercriminals from owning it in the first place:
1.  Service providers can help. If you’re locked out of your account, you 
should try to regain access from the service provider. Go to the help 
area of your provider. There are some quick reference links for Gmail, 
Hotmail, AOL, and Yahoo!
2.  Change your password. If somebody does grab your account but you can 
still log onto it, immediately change your password. See a demo for how 
to choose a strong password at http://www.wbtv.com/story/27286716/
I t ’ s  a  G l o b a l  T h i n g
Websites that house malware and viruses originate from countries around 
the globe. According to researchers at G DATA Security Labs, the majority 
of malicious and fraudulent websites are hosted on servers in the United 
States (a whopping 43.3 percent), followed by 9.5 percent in China, and 
8.2 percent in France.*

3.  Check your settings. Once you get back into your account, check all your 
settings. The hackers may have changed settings such as “forward all 
e-mails to account ABC@differentmail.com.”
4.  Check any auto login from e-mail to other apps or accounts. If you auto 
login for other apps or accounts, you may want to change the passwords 
for those apps and check their settings as well.
5.  Tell your friends and family. Tell everyone your account was hacked and 
not to respond to e-mails from you, click on links, or open attach-
ments.
6.  Use two-factor authentication. Before the worst happens, try turning 
on two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is usually 
tied to your cell phone and many Internet companies will send a 
short code to your cell phone when they see a login that doesn’t 
match your usual patterns (e.g., different location or a different 
device).
7.  Run antimalware and antivirus software. Make sure you don’t have 
malware logging your keystrokes; if you do, the cybercriminals will be 
back! Microsoft has a free malware removal tool and Sophos has one

Criminal Techniques du Jour
The profile of the criminals behind spam, scams, and Internet identity theft 
is hard to pin down. Law enforcement officials have uncovered sophisticated 
networks, but they have also found criminals who acted alone. But no matter 
what the criminal profile, these creeps have a variety of techniques you should 
know about to protect yourself.
Nigerian Scams
Advance fee scams, also referred to as “419 Internet scams,” are often tied 
to Nigeria. The 419 is a reference to Nigeria’s criminal code for fraud. These are 
essentially phishing scams that usually involve money. The criminal has your 
e-mail address and sends you a message begging for your help and assistance. 
According to Krebs on Security, there are various auction sites that help these 
criminals get your e-mail address so they can send you their scam e-mails. 
419eater.com is a group of people who have come together to track these 419 
scams to spread awareness and alerts to the general public.

Spyware
Spyware finds its way onto your digital device by hiding behind free apps 
or ringtones or games, pop-up ads, or through scareware messages that tell you 
your computer is being repaired while actually installing software to track and 
report your every move back to the criminals. Spyware is sometimes used to get 
information for marketing to you, but criminals could also be using it for more 
sinister activities. Internet criminals find spyware an attractive method for col-
lecting information such as e-mail account logins, websites you like to surf, and 
instant message contents.
Even legitimate looking apps can fool you and the online store you buy 
them from. In September 2015, the popular Apple App Store had to remove 
several apps that had become infected with malware. The malware hidden in 
the apps was designed to trick the user into giving up passwords to their Apple 
iCloud accounts. In October 2015, Apple found that another set of apps had to 
be removed. In this case, Apple found that roughly 250 apps were collecting the 
personal information of anyone who downloaded them. Many of the apps were, 
in some cases, downloaded as many as one million times.25
The Google Play store has had its share of scamsters, too. In early 2015 
there were a few Android apps that behaved normally when first downloaded. 
After thirty days, however, the apps would begin spamming users with messages 
that their computers were out of memory and that they had a security issue. The 
evil app would then reroute them to other malware-laden web pages and apps 
that could supposedly help them resolve the issue. The motive for this scam was 
to collect information about the users.26
Poisoned Search Results
Criminals know that people trust and use search engines such as Yahoo!, 
Bing, and Google. Google reported that roughly 1 percent of its search results 
might contain poisoned links, which are links that take you to malicious sites. 
Google does its best to manage and filter those criminal links out, but it’s a good 
idea to think before you click on those search engine results or a link within the 
results. Sponsored ads that appear at the top of search results are often the most 
likely to contain such dangers.
Clickjacking
Clickjacking is a variation on using social engineering to trick you into 
clicking on a link. The link appears to be legitimate because it seems to lead to 
a business you have visited or an item that should interest you based on what 
the criminal has learned about you. In reality, the criminal has hijacked the page 
so that your click activates the code they want to execute. You probably won’t 
know what has happened, and you might keep clicking away on a site that you

think is Facebook without realizing that you have been clickjacked. A typical 
tactic is having the clickjacked link suddenly sent out to all your contacts so that 
it becomes viral, affecting expanding groups of people in a geometric pattern. 
Criminals like to use clickjacking to steal your personal information, but some-
times they hijack clicks to earn money on surveys that pay by the click.
Social Media Posts Could Be Your Way Intro Trouble
Companies now encourage us to tweet, Facebook, Google+, and Instagram 
them when we have a good or bad service experience. The latest cybercrime scam 
waits for people to post on social media that they are upset about a customer 
service issue. Scamsters then send the individual a customer service message that 
looks like it is from the legitimate company. The consumer responds thinking 
their issue is going to be handled and accidentally gives away critical information 
about them.
Sexual Predators
A Pew Internet study found that one in five sixteen year olds has received 
a sexually explicit text, or a sexting message. That number jumps to 30 percent 
when teens reach age seventeen. An Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine 
study states that 25 percent of teens have sent a sext.27
According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
(NCMEC), in 2014 their CyberTipline received 1.1 million reports, most of 
which related to child sexual abuse images, online enticement, including “sextor-
tion,” and child sex trafficking.28
Grown women are targets of sexual predators, too, with the predators’ pri-
mary outreach on social networking sites and online dating spaces. Congress is 
so concerned about online safety for both men and women on dating services 
that it has introduced draft legislation requiring dating sites to tell their users 
whether they require background checks. Parry Aftab, an Internet privacy law-
yer, warns, “No central authority or group is counting how many sex crimes are 
Internet-related.”
Online sexual predators have found a twenty-four-hour playground to target 
victims. They’re watching in chat rooms, they barge in on instant chat sessions 
that do not have privacy settings turned on, they frequent social networking 
sites, and they play games in Internet gaming forums.
So, who are these people? The profile of sexual predators may surprise 
you. The Center for Internet Addiction Recovery reviewed twenty-two cases of 
alleged sex offenders and found that Internet sexual predators typically have an 
addictive disorder, and they use online sexual exploits as a way to avoid facing 
issues in their personal lives. According to the review, sexual predators are typi-
cally male and range in age from eighteen to fifty-five, but they can be as young

as thirteen. Some of the predators are married. Law enforcement says that Inter-
net sexual predators know what they’re looking for and how to connect based on 
their personal preferences. They especially like to find victims who post notes 
of frustration, loneliness, or sadness because they can more easily befriend them 
and earn their trust over time.
In one real-life example of sexual predation, a forty-one-year-old male tried 
to befriend a fourteen-year-old girl, who he found on Facebook. He used Face-
book to message and text her. He encouraged the girl to sneak away to meet 
with him and finally convinced her to come. Only in this case, thankfully, the 
girl was actually a police officer. Law enforcement was given a tip, and they took 
over her Facebook account and communicated with the man using the fourteen-
year-old’s online persona. He met his “girl” and went off to jail. Unfortunately, 
not all of these criminal actions end this way.
The issue of online sexual predators has gained a lot of attention. For 
example, actor David Schwimmer from the NBC comedy Friends produced a 
film called Trust, which addresses the issue of Internet sexual predators. He felt 
he needed to do something to open up the dialogue between parents and kids 
about the dangers of being tracked and approached online. You can watch a 
promo for the film at www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qDwNCzlidI.
Revenge Porn
Revenge porn is legally defined by many countries as the sharing of per-
sonal, private, sexually explicit photos or videos of another person without their 
consent. Often this is done with the goal of either extorting the victim or causing 
the victim personal distress.29
The crime is increasing, motivating countries around the globe to enact 
revenge porn laws. England and Wales passed the Criminal Justice and Courts 
Bill that includes an amendment to address revenge porn. If you are convicted 
of trafficking in revenge porn in these countries, you could face up to two years 
in prison.30 Several U.S. states have revenge porn prohibition statutes as well.
Many jurisdiction’s laws have not kept up, and there is little hope for victims 
of this horrible crime. The good news is that social media networks are stand-
ing up for revenge porn victims. In February 2015 Reddit, a digital social media 
bulletin board, said it would ban all sexually explicit content posted without the 
consent of those in the pictures. Twitter enacted something similar in March 
2015. Twitter now immediately removes any “link to a photograph, video, or 
digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct” 
that has been posted without consent. In June 2015, not long after the Reddit 
and Twitter changes were put into effect, Google stated it would delete links 
to revenge porn on request. In July 2015, Microsoft created an online form for 
victims to fill out to request removal of revenge porn.31

Dahlia*, aged twenty-one, was in her last semester attending New York 
University on a full scholarship when she received the first text message. It was 
from a number she didn’t recognize and read, “ur ad iz so hottt. watz ur rate?” 
The sender then went into graphic detail complimenting Dahlia’s body, accu-
rately describing her hip tattoo, and describing the things he wanted to do to 
those hips. Five minutes later, her phone vibrated with another message from 
a different number, this one containing a picture of somebody’s penis. The 
texts—and then calls—didn’t stop coming and were all from different callers. 
Some seemed to know her name and the address of her dorm. Finally, one 
sender took mercy on her and sent a link to the ad everybody was referencing. 
To Dahlia’s horror, there on Backpage.com were naked photos of her advertis-
ing sex: “Shy College Girl but Ready, Willing, and Blow-ur-soxxx-off Kinky—
Outcall Only—21 (NY).” The ad contained her phone number, address, the 
name of the gym where she worked part-time, and school. Dahlia flagged the 
ad, and it was removed by the site administrators, but almost immediately a 
new one replaced it. Then the naked images began popping up other places—
on a Tumblr page. Imposter Facebook and Twitter accounts showcasing the 
nude images were created in her name and then friend requests and follows 
were sent to Dahlia’s friends, relatives, classmates, and even her professors.
Over the course of the week, Dahlia’s search engine results changed. 
Her LinkedIn page was still up top, but the next ninety-three results were 
populated not by articles about her semester working at an NGO in Mali or 
the award she’d won for leading the Model United Nations. Rather, the hits 
led to links to her nude pictures on Internet sites she never knew existed: 
Xhammster, Pornhub, Xtube, and Redtube.
Dahlia tried to remove the images, but it felt futile—like a game of 
whack-a-mole. The images were spreading faster than she could remove 
them, and some websites refused to take them down without her sending 
them letters. She got some help sending those letters, but then the letters 
with her name and the link were published on a website managed by Har-
vard and the pictures still existed on the Wayback Machine, an Internet 
archive. Some sites refused to remove the pictures unless she proved she 
owned the copyright. Unfortunately, some of the pictures were taken by her 
ex-boyfriend. Technically she couldn’t claim copyright ownership of those, 
even though it was her naked body depicted.
Dahlia tried keeping it in perspective. Unlike the poor people she’d helped 
during her semester abroad in Mali, at least she had clean water, electricity,

a bed. However, life was different now. Even basic things like grabbing cof-
fee at the Starbucks next door or going to her favorite kickboxing class felt 
horrifying and exposing. By visiting the porn sites where her pictures were 
posted, she could see that half a million strangers had seen her genitals, not 
to mention those known to her who had received direct contacts over social 
media. Meanwhile, her family and friends were less than supportive. She’d 
stopped counting the number of times somebody had said, “That’s why I 
don’t take sexy pictures” or “You know, you do share some of the responsi-
bility.”
Most difficult of all was that Dahlia did not know who did this. Only 
one other person had ever even seen the pictures, Thor. In fact, he’d taken 
some of them. Their relationship ended on bad terms, but that was months 
ago and when she reached out to him, he assured her he wasn’t responsible. 
Who could it be, though? Who could hate her this much? Was she hacked 
like the celebrities during the summer of 2014? There was the time she took 
her computer to the Apple Genius counter after the Mountain Dew mishap. 
That guy was sketchy. What about that creepy guy she met on OKCupid 
who told her he would destroy her life when she turned him down for a date. 
And she never did find her old iPad after her roommate had that party. Oh, 
and her phone was lost in an Uber for twenty-four hours before she began 
password protecting it. OMG, had she remembered to log out of her iCloud 
account at the school library? At the computers at work?
Meanwhile, life was getting worse. More strangers were calling and ha-
rassing her. All the jobs at NGOs and nonprofits where she’d interviewed 
before this began, stopped pursuing her, and nobody was inviting her on in-
terviews. Dahlia went on a couple first dates, but as soon as the guy learned 
her last name and Googled her, there were no second dates. Or if there were, 
it was because he thought she was a porn star. And truthfully, that’s how she 
felt—like an indentured porn star, forced into becoming the sexual enter-
tainment of others. The counseling center at school was supportive, but they 
seemed most interested in making sure it was not a school-related event that 
would trigger Title IX. Somebody suggested she tell the cops, but when she 
went to the precinct, the officer brushed her off, telling her to just stop being 
on the computer all the time and informing her that there’s nothing illegal in 
her state about sharing consensually created naked pictures of an adult. Plus 
the offender could be on the other side of the world, they told her, adding 
that law enforcement is busy enough fighting actual danger.

Interview with an Expert
Revenge-porn lawyer Carrie Goldberg, founding attorney, C. A. Goldberg, 
PLLC
Q: Can you describe the legal work you do for victims of Internet privacy 
invasions and revenge porn?
A: I represent individuals under attack. I sue rapists, get justice for victims of 
revenge porn and sextortion, protect public figures from psychotic superfans. 
I’m the go-to person if a person’s personal information, sex videos, or photos 
are going viral on the Internet. My most serious cases are victims who are 
underage. Often the defendant is the school. 
Q: What kinds of problems do you solve that are unique to this practice area?
A: Confirming the opposing party is a major first issue—because many on-
line attacks are anonymous. We do intelligence and determine threat risks. 
Is the offender a present danger? Additionally, is the victim a danger to her-
self? Many victims do not know how to cope with nonconsensual Internet 
exposure. We remove content from the Internet, too. And of course, we 
sue when needed. Because these are typically highly private matters, we 
make pre-filing motions to proceed under a pseudonym and for the file to 
be sealed. 
Q: What are common scenarios you see relating to Internet privacy? 
A: They run the gamut. Jilted ex-boyfriends who feel the need to “settle the 
score” by sending naked pictures of their ex to everybody in her social circle. 
We see ex-mistresses who are threatening to spread images if the sugar daddy 
refuses to pay up, celebrities who have superfans stalking them, teens whose 
nude images have circulated around the school. I also have clients who were 
extorted by strangers who befriended them on the Internet. Sometimes offend-
ers purchase ads on Craigslist and Backpage impersonating the victim soliciting 
sex and information about how to contact the victim. In fact, the majority of 
cases involve the publication of truthful facts (e.g., name, address, school, date 
of birth, phone number, e-mail, employer, etc.) about our client alongside the 
intimate images which make victims prone to harassment from the revenge 
porn consumers. In many cases, the image was not created with consent—the 
victim was photographed or filmed without her knowledge or she was passed 
out or her webcam was hacked and used as a portal to film her. Worse still are 
the scenarios in which the recorded sexual act was nonconsensual. The saddest 
cases are those in which a rape video is going viral around a middle or high 
school. 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
42
Q: What sparked your interest in this area of law?
A: Nowadays, if a person is under attack, almost always there is an online com-
ponent to that attack. My knowledge base is unique—16 years of working with 
traumatized people, a litigation background, experience lawyering in the fields 
of domestic violence, Internet law, intellectual property, knowledge of criminal 
and first amendment law, etc. Most importantly, I can personally relate to 
what it means to be under attack. I started this firm after I was the target of a 
malevolent actor and was unable to find an attorney who could help me. My 
only objective is to be for others the kind of lawyer I needed during my turmoil.
Q: What tools do you use to help victims of revenge porn?
A: My plan of attack varies based on the priorities of the victim, the informa-
tion we have about the offender, and the nature of the attack. There is no pro-
scribed way to handle these situations and instead we must carefully consider 
all factors at play. There are generally six categories of tools I use: 
1.  ISP advocacy
2.  copyright
3.  criminal law
4.  family offense proceedings
5.  civil court
6.  school disciplinary proceedings and Title IX
Each of these tools is imperfect, but collectively they provide victims of online 
harassment with a wide range of options. 
Q: Can you briefly describe each of those six tools?
A: Yes.
•  Internet Service Provider Advocacy: Offenders frequently use mainstream 
social media companies to disseminate images, create imposter accounts in 
the victim’s name, and for delivering threats to victims. In 2015 a number of 
our biggest social media companies (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Insta-
gram, Reddit, etc.) established bans on revenge porn. Using forms on these 
companies’ websites, victims’ nude pictures can be removed within hours. I 
have contacts at these companies who I speak to when the form submis-
sions do not result in removal. Search engines (i.e., Google, Bing) also now 
have forms victims can use so that revenge porn content is removed from 
a victim’s search engine results. I also deal with the ISPs to report abusive 
accounts. When the revenge porn is published on a website the offender has 
created, I report it to the hosting company.

•  Copyright: Individuals automatically own the copyright images they took 
themselves. So, if the nude image is a “selfie,” any third party who publishes 
it without the copyright owner’s consent is infringing upon that copyright. 
A victim need not actually register the copyright in order to own it. If a 
website is notified that they published infringing material, they can be sued 
pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) if they fail to 
swiftly remove content. Even if the image is not a selfie, I can help negotiate 
for the copyright to be transferred to the victim so that she can benefit from 
the DMCA laws. 
•  Criminal Laws: More than half of all states have laws criminalizing revenge 
porn. Coercion and extortion laws are also relevant in the frequent cases 
where the offender threatens to distribute the images prior to actually doing 
so. So, sometimes, the swiftest and cheapest way for a victim to seek protec-
tion is through local law enforcement. I help victims prepare their evidence 
and advocate for an investigation to be opened into these cases. It can be an 
upward battle convincing under-resourced law enforcement departments to 
prioritize these cases.
•  Family Offense Proceedings: So often the offender is a jilted ex who is 
aggressing and stalking the victim in a myriad of ways online and offline. 
I can commence a case in family court and the victim can leave court that 
very day with a Temporary Order of Protection. Once served, if the offender 
aggresses against her, he can be arrested. 
•  Civil Court: Victims can sue the offender for money or for an injunction 
to stop him from aggressing. While our criminal laws aim to punish the 
offender, our civil laws focus on restoring the victim financially. Depend-
ing on the state, we can sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress, 
privacy invasions, and now a growing number of states have specific revenge 
porn laws. Through civil court, we can also subpoena online service provid-
ers to de-anonymize offenders. Through civil court we can also seek an 
injunction to stop the abuse. 
•  School Disciplinary Proceedings: For my younger victims of revenge porn, 
the dissemination of images happens at school. It is critical that the school 
conduct a prompt and thorough investigation immediately to stop the 
spread of the image and punish the wrongdoers. Schools must also refer 
the victim to a Title IX coordinator and make sure the victim is supported. 
If they botch their responsibilities, creating a hostile environment for the 
victim, the school risks becoming the target of a Title IX discrimination 
complaint with the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights or the 
defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging a Title IX violation. 
Q: If you had one piece of advice for the public, what would it be?
A: Nine out of ten of my cases begin with “I met him online.” So, be careful 
with online dating. It’s the best thing that has ever happened to predators.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
44
Q: What is a common misperception that people have about victims of 
revenge porn?
A: That the victim is always female. Although the majority of victims are 
female (which is why I tend to use female pronouns), plenty of men also suffer 
from their nudes going viral. 
Q: If you had one piece of advice for non-victims?
A: Do not blame the victim. She (or he) is already unhappy and does not 
need additional judgment. Just as we do not shame burglary victims for living 
in a house, there is no point blaming victims for taking the picture. Nobody 
is 100 percent protected from being the victim of revenge porn. Many of my 
clients never took a nude picture in their life. Rather, they were filmed with-
out their permission, their picture was Photoshopped onto a porn star’s body, 
or their bikini was Photoshopped off of an innocuous beach photo on their 
Facebook wall. 
Q: What are the biggest challenges you face as a practitioner?
A: Anonymous offenders. 
Q: How do you address this challenge?
A: I first exhaust all open source information gathering as I can, based on what 
I know about the offender—usernames, IP information, and whatever personal 
information he has revealed to my client. If that does not yield results, I retain 
high level cyber intelligence professionals to help. The next step, if we are 
still at a loss, we can initiate a civil proceeding against a John Doe defendant. 
Depending on the state, pre-litigation discovery may be an option too. Once 
we have an index number, we can subpoena online service providers to obtain 
meta-data, IP addresses, and other identifying information. Once we have the 
identity, if we still wish to proceed with the case, we can amend the complaint 
to substitute the name of the offender.
Q: What’s the first thing someone should do if she finds a private photo of 
herself online?
A: If somebody finds a private photo of herself online, swift action is essential. 
Immediately take a screen shot. If there’s info about when it was posted, who 
posted it, and how many views it’s gotten, take a screen shot of those things, 
too along with any comments posted. I use a third-party remote system (Page 
Vault) to document pages so that they are easily authenticated in court. Do

not erase any incoming messages from the offender. Back-up and store this 
content. 
Next, contact the website that posted it. Inform them that it depicts you and 
that it was posted without your consent. Demand that it be removed immedi-
ately and that they provide you with the following information:
•  Identity of the person who posted image(s);
•  IP address of the person who posted image(s);
•  Date when image(s) were submitted;
•  Date when it was posted (if not obvious);
•  Number of unique views the image(s) had received. Save the e-mail 
and re-send it if the material is not removed. 
Search elsewhere online to see if images were posted on other websites. 
Visit the site regularly to see if it has been removed. If it’s not removed within 
24 hours, contact an attorney. The nonprofit End Revenge Porn has vetted attor-
neys who have volunteered to assist victims. If you know who posted it, keep 
track of all other hostile contact from that person. Contact the police if you feel 
threatened. Keep notes about your emotional and physical responses (i.e., trouble 
sleeping, nausea, inability to eat, vomiting). Do not block the offender’s phone 
number. If you have a claim of harassment, the more incoming communications, 
the better. Under no circumstances, should the victim engage in any direct nego-
tiations or back-and-forth with the offender. Victims should also batten-down 
the hatches on their online security and privacy—hide Facebook friends lists and 
require notification if somebody wants to write on your wall. Create complex 
passphrases and 2-step notification on all accounts. 
Q: What resources are available to victims?
A: 
The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (www.endrevengeporn.org) is a nonprofit which 
has informational resources for victims, links to lawyers, words of support, 
links to forms for removal on social media, and also provides direct services 
through a 24 hour crisis helpline (1-844-878-CCRI). 
Woman Against Revenge Porn (www.womenagainstrevengeporn.com) is run by a 
victim and is devoted to helping revenge porn victims through photo removal 
and other tips and attorney links.
Without My Consent (www.withoutmyconsent.org) is a nonprofit that empow-
ers victims of online privacy invasions to fight against online harassment. It 
is a great resource for practitioners as well, with terrific documentation of the 
law.

Authorities
Today we have cameras watching us just about every place we go. The 
United Kingdom has roughly 1.85 million surveillance cameras, and the 
UK’s Association of Chief Police Officers estimates that the average person 
in Great Britain is caught on surveillance cameras an average of seventy 
times per day.
That level of surveillance is not unique to the United Kingdom. For exam-
ple, the Highland Village police department in Texas uses public safety cameras 
to scan license plates to find stolen cars or criminals, and they decided to keep 
those images in a database. They have pictures of everyone’s license plate on 
camera along with each vehicle’s location and the date and time that the picture 
was taken. They use this database as a primary source for police investigations. 
But could that information invade your privacy?
Law enforcement, in an effort to expand their ability to promote neighbor-
hood awareness, is making use of social networking sites and e-mail with great 
success. Your neighborhood watch has gone global and digital. If you have an 
embarrassing run-in with the law, your misfortune might be digitized for all 
your neighbors to see online.
One police department in Ohio is using Facebook to ask citizens for their 
help in fighting and solving crimes. They post clues, information, photos, and 
videos. If you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, might you, 
even if you’re completely innocent of any wrongdoing, come under suspicion? 
It’s important to note that many of the companies that you do business with each 
and every day receive law enforcement and government requests for data. Those 
requests only seem to increase with time. Facebook, for example, stated on their 
blogpost that global government requests for data increased by 18 percent in 
the first half of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014, bringing the 
total number of global requests for the first half of 2015 to more than forty 
thousand.32

An Issue around the Globe
As of the writing of this book, several countries are debating important rules 
that will have an impact on your right to privacy and your ability to protect your 
Internet identity for years, and maybe for your lifetime.
Russia has demanded that Twitter stop storing tweets and profile informa-
tion provided by Russian citizens in any country outside of Russia.
The situation is so confusing that Microsoft asked their company’s chief 
legal officer, Brad Smith, to blog about privacy following the overturn of the 
safe harbour arrangement between the European Union and the United States. 
The EU data safe harbour was part of a regime that allowed the United States 
to transfer and store EU citizen data on U.S. servers. Smith asked the United 
States in his blog post to agree that “it will only demand access to personal 
information that is stored in the United States and belongs to an EU national in 
a manner that conforms with EU law, and vice versa.”33
Secrets Out in the Open
Do you support a political candidate? Your employer may have a strong 
political bias that is the opposite of yours. Many of us have been raised to believe 
that it is taboo to talk partisan politics in social or work situations. However, 
if you have donated money to a political campaign, you should be aware that 
information about your contribution is available for everyone to see.
You might think it would take a covert computer geek to look up this type 
of information, but the reality is that your neighbor, potential date, and boss can 
all go online and see what causes you contribute to within minutes. One of the 
more popular sites to check out this type of information is www.OpenSecrets 
.org. You can also look up your favorite or not so favorite politician to see who their 
major contributors are. So much for keeping your political affiliations a secret.

According to a story covered in Wired magazine, twenty-year-old Mission 
College student Yasir Afifi was getting an oil change when the mechanic called 
him over to look at something odd on his car. The FBI had warned Afifi a few 
months earlier that, because of an anonymous tip, he might be watched as a 
national security threat. Sometime later, Afifi’s mechanic pointed out the sur-
veillance equipment under his car.34

Afifi found two devices near the car exhaust attached by magnets. He 
removed these devices and photographed them. Then Afifi posted these 
photos online, asking people to give him clues about what the devices were. 
A helpful person saw his inquiry and informed that he had in his possession the 
Guardian ST 820, a GPS type of device used for tracking. Afifi was alarmed 
when he found out that this type of device is exclusively created for and sold to 
the U.S. Army and law enforcement. Once the devices were no longer work-
ing, according to Afifi, the FBI retrieved them and told him that he did not 
need to worry or call a lawyer because he was “boring.” This practice is a tool

You think you are surfing the Internet and browsing various topics in the 
privacy of your own home, but your digital feet are actually leaving big, bold 
tracks that can be recorded. In fact, if the FBI gets their way, your Internet 
service provider (ISP) will be required to track your browsing paths and 
store them for up to twenty-four months. This information would be avail-
able to local law enforcement as well as state and federal authorities if they 
serve your ISP with a search warrant or subpoena.
We were largely surprised by the lack of hue and outcry when the head-
line “Feds ‘Pinged’ Sprint GPS Data 8 Million Times over a Year” hit the 
news in December 2009. Perhaps people were too tired from dealing with 
bad economic news and planning for the holiday season’s festivities to care.
But take a look behind that headline for a moment to see why you should 
be concerned. Sprint Nextel was asked by law enforcement through court 
orders and emergency orders to provide customer location data between 
the twelve months from September 2008 through October 2009, and they 
complied. In fact, Sprint Nextel provides law enforcement with its own 
self-service portal where they can set up automatic tracking for certain users 
based on their mobile phone numbers. That handy service on Sprint Nextel 
generated more than eight million transactions involving information sent 
to law enforcement. The fact is, if you are a Sprint Nextel customer, you may 
be under surveillance.
But Sprint is not the only carrier handling such requests—evidently 
all the wireless carriers receive about one hundred requests per week for 
customer-location data.

that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies use to protect our security, 
although since Afifi’s discovery, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that this 
practice of tracking vehicles for long-term surveillance is not allowed without 
a warrant.
Is it only U.S. intelligence keeping tabs on their citizens? Not at all. In 
China, a woman posted a retweet on Twitter that landed her a year in a labor 
camp. The tweet was satire, but the Chinese government did not see the humor 
in retweeting a comment about smashing the Japan Pavilion that was erected as 
part of the expo 2010 Shanghai.35
The IRS Goes Online
Are you behind on your taxes? Are you fudging your income a little or a lot? 
If so, there’s a new “friend” looking for you on Facebook and Myspace. You may 
recognize his initials: IRS.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is combing through social media net-
works to catch disconnects between the income you might report on your tax 
returns and your lifestyle. The agency has a process that looks at items such as 
relocation information, professional profiles, and even postings that brag about 
expensive vacations.
Want an example? Here are just two out of many:
•  The Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS Nebraska office found a 
DJ on Myspace bragging about spinning disks at a big party—income 
he never reported. Subsequently, they collected $2,000 from him.
•  The IRS nabbed a Minnesota man for back taxes when he posted a 
comment on Myspace that said he was returning to his hometown to 
start a new job and then named his employer. The IRS swooped in and 
garnished his wages.
But as if government surveillance à la 1984 wasn’t scary enough, there are 
other entities out there studying your online identity and actions.
Homeland Security
In 2010, ten alleged spies from Russia were deported. As their names, 
photos, and places of employment were announced on the nightly news, many 
people found that they were connected to the spies either directly or through a 
friend, or a friend of a friend, on LinkedIn, the professional networking website.
Why would spies join LinkedIn? The answer is simple: many of us take our 
trusting selves to the Internet. We link to people we know, they link to people 
they know, and then the circle widens. You begin by linking to people you met 
at a conference. You do not want to appear rude by ignoring their colleagues’ 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
50
requests to link to you. Then people join networking and information-sharing 
groups. Spies know about this behavior, and they listen, join, post, and assimi-
late information just like the rest of us. However, their purpose is to collect 
information for their sponsors, not to further their careers.
How could a spy lurking online affect you? You might be surprised. An 
alleged spy ring was busted in the summer of 2010.36 One of the alleged spies for 
Russia, Anna Chapman, was fairly active on Facebook and LinkedIn.37 While 
researching this book, we asked friends and associates to look at how close they 
came to being linked with her. One associate checked it out, skeptically, and 
then realized that several of his associates were connected to a person connected 
to Anna. Anna clearly knew who to connect to. One of her friends on Facebook 
was Steve Jurvetson. Steve is known for his venture capital work as a partner at 
Draper Fisher Jurvetson. When asked by the press about his connection to her, 
Steve Jurvetson replied in an e-mail, “I don’t know her. So many randoms on 
Facebook.” But think about it: In your career or personal life, what consequences 
could an online connection with a spy or a crook or a prostitute cause?
The Corporate World
Companies are watching employees for a variety of reasons. According to the 
2011 Security Threat Report produced by Sophos, 57 percent of businesses are 
concerned that their staff shares too much information on the Internet. Employ-
ers are finding that it is effective to track employee surfing habits at work to 
protect their brand and security interests and make sure that nobody is disclosing 
sensitive company data.
The Society for Human Resource Management conducted a survey of 
companies and identified that roughly 75 percent have some form of Internet 
monitoring in place to track their employees. Employers track behaviors to 
make sure their employees are not breaking any laws by gambling or download-
ing pornography to the corporate network or individual computers. Companies 
may track your Internet usage, uploads/downloads of information or computer 
software, images that you look at online, and your incoming/outgoing e-mails 
and attachments.
Data Mining Your Life
Whether it’s a creep or a company or a government looking at you online, every 
day they get a richer source of information about you as your online informa-
tion piles up—and that record of your life is often permanent. Businesses are 
using the information you provide online in a variety of ways that might sur-
prise you.

Social Exposure
Here’s one example of a social website and how it treats your information. 
You might use Twitter to voice your displeasure with your company or even 
your boss. However, do you realize that your venting just became part of an 
online archive that is searchable by everyone? All public tweets from the time 
that Twitter began are archived at the Library of Congress. With the touch of 
a finger or a single mouse click, anybody can access a lifetime of posts, pictures, 
and secrets.
Exposure Both Unintentional and Intentional
Twitter isn’t alone. Many of the services you use online, such as Amazon, 
eBay, Google, and Facebook, know a lot about you. Sometimes they share your 
details publicly for all to see, and sometimes they just sell that information to 
others.
Sometimes this exposure is intentional, as when Facebook shows high-level 
posts to people who search the site. Other times, these services share your infor-
mation inadvertently, exposing it as the result of a massive technology glitch.
Here’s an example of a site exposing you without intending to. Hackers tar-
geted and gained access to Gawker, a New York–based blog focusing on celebrity 
gossip and other trendy topics. The hackers posted e-mail address information 
online, leaving many Gawker users exposed.
How Others Use Technology to Track You
Now that you have an idea about who’s watching, we want to explore the tech-
nologies they’re using to hunt down you and your information. From tracking 
software to geotags embedded in photos, these folks have plenty of tech help in 
keeping an eye on you.
Tracking: Harmful or Helpful?
When a website tracks your habits and your whereabouts via your phone 
or your computer, it can seem convenient. Technology can be used on a site to 
“remember” your favorite landing page. You can automatically log in to your 
favorite websites because your browser remembers your password for you. Sites 
can remember you and welcome you back, even making product recommenda-
tions based on your buying history.
Your computer may be able to track your online activities, but your cell 
phone may be able to track you as you move around the real world. If your phone 
was built for a cell provider in the United States after 2005, chances are you 
are carrying a snooping device in your pocket or on your belt. In that year the 
Federal Communications Commission required that cellular phone companies 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
52
have 95 percent or more of the phones on their networks be traceable by satellite 
and other global positioning technologies (GPS). Your phone company, if your 
phone has a signal, can pinpoint your location to within roughly one hundred 
feet. Though this might sound creepy to you, this same technology helps to 
find lost or injured car drivers, helps parents locate their kids, and aids police in 
tracking kidnapping victims.
The current tracking technology is considered so effective that many shel-
ters for battered women and children require that victims take their phone bat-
teries out and store their phones, disassembled, so their abusers can’t locate them 
using tracking technology.
When you can be tracked on your cell phone as a person of interest is still 
a little muddy. In the United States, law enforcement can track you on your 
phone. They can request assistance from phone companies (from January to June 
2015, Verizon alone received more than 21,000 requests for cell phone logs) or 
use something called the Stingray.
In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice ruled that, except for 
urgent situations, federal agents must seek warrants before using a clone cell 
phone tower tool called a Stingray. The cloned cell phone tower mimics a legiti-
mate cell phone tower and can record your phone’s exact geographic location as 
well as numbers called while connected to the Stingray. As of the writing of this 
book, the Stingray itself cannot be used to eavesdrop on a conversation. Because 
it looks like a legitimate cell tower, you may never know you are connected to it.
“It’s how we find killers. It’s how we find kidnappers. It’s how we find drug 
dealers. It’s how we find missing children. It’s how we find pedophiles,” said FBI 
Director James Comey.38
T r a c k i n g  G o e s  t o  W o r k
Software companies are providing tools and analytics to help your employer 
track you when you are off the clock. Tools such as Social Sentry will tell 
your boss whenever you post something to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. 
The alert will happen even if you do not submit your posts at the office. The 
technology is advancing, and it has become easier than ever for your employ-
ers to keep tabs on you to protect their company’s brand. Services such as 
InfoCheckUSA offer a service that provides social networking information 
on employees to employers.

At this time, if a state or local municipality in the United States wants to use 
a Stingray to collect data, the use of this technology does not require a warrant.
Law enforcement has other options at their disposal as well, but these often 
require a warrant. They can contact your cell carrier and ask for your GPS to be 
tracked. They can request your Internet protocol (IP) traffic from social media 
companies such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Google. Keep in mind that 
your IP address may reveal your physical location at the time you were connected.
Safe or Sinister: Checking into Trouble
There’s a fun feature available these days from location check-in services 
that allow you to share your activities with your friends. You can use your smart-
phone, computer, or Web-enabled tablet to check in when you arrive at a coffee 
shop, business, shopping mall, or just about any place you can think of. This is 
a great way to announce to your friends where you are so they can find you. It 
also leaves you naked online, with your schedule, whereabouts, and habits avail-
able for all to see.
The check-in options are constantly multiplying, and in our first edition 
of this book, the popular services included Gowalla, Foursquare, and Facebook 
Places. The use of these services by businesses continues to morph. Today, you 
have many options to choose from including the three most popular: Four-
square, Meetup, and Yelp. By broadcasting where you are at all times, you also 
broadcast your habits and patterns to employers, friends, criminals, and stalkers. 
And remember, you are also broadcasting the locations where you are not, such 
as your place of employment, church, or expensive house.
But check-in can go wrong. A man was tweeting about a fabulous time he 
was having at a particular location. His friends played a practical joke on him 
and called the establishment and told them that his car had been stolen. The 
man ran out to the parking lot to find his car there, but the lesson stuck: When 
you tweet where you are, you are leaving yourself open to bad guys and friends 
with a bad sense of humor.
The authors were discussing this with a colleague and friend, a senior tech-
nology executive that asked to remain anonymous. This colleague was previously 
a human intelligence officer, and he specifically asks his colleagues never to post 
comments about how nice it was to see him until he has gotten home because 
he does not like to broadcast that his wife is home alone when he is away on a 
business trip. In a recent conversation with him, he advised, “Talk about where 
you have been, not where you are.”39
Photo-Sharing Sites
Within six minutes of using a search engine and typing in somebody’s name, 
we were able to access that person’s profile and find her photo-sharing site. 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
54
Within those six minutes, based on how the woman had chronicled the lives 
of her children, we could tell what each child looked like, their names, family 
friends, recent vacations, and favorite activities. After we demonstrated this to 
a group of people, they were stunned at how easy it was to skim through the 
photo records of this family. There were enough details for them to guess ages, 
schools, and interests. In the wrong hands, the parents or kids could be targeted 
for ID theft or worse.
Photos with Geotags
Have you recently uploaded photos to the Internet? If you take a picture 
using your cell phone camera or a newer digital camera, it’s likely that there are 
little codes inside the photo files that you cannot see but that tell a lot about 
the photo itself. Some of these codes help sharpen the image, but there are also 
geotags inside digital photos that include the exact coordinates where the photo 
was taken. If you upload photos the moment you take them, you are broadcast-
ing your location.
A U.S. Army field artillery officer found out the hard way about geotagged 
photos. He was in Iraq and uploaded photos and videos to his favorite social 
networking and photo-sharing sites. He did not realize that by doing this, he 
was giving away the exact grid coordinates of the mission.
You may not be giving away military secrets, but if you take a picture of 
yourself or a loved one in front of your upscale house or shiny new car and upload 
it to the Internet, the information in the photos is broadcasting to everyone the 
latitude and longitude of your nice home and new car. Don’t believe us? While 
conducting research for this book, we came across a website called pleaserobme 
.com dedicated to people who unwittingly invite criminals into their homes.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that computer programs put on your computer as you 
surf the Net. Sometimes cookies help with authentication, such as recognizing 
that you’re using a personal rather than a public computer when you sign into 
online banking. Other cookies track items you place in an online shopping cart, 
even if you never complete the purchase. Many sites use cookies to custom-
ize your experience. A newer type of cookie, called a persistent cookie, stays on 
your computer even after you leave your Internet browsing session or turn the 
machine off. Most cookies are helpful and harmless, and you can delete them 
from your computer if they bother you, but in the wrong hands, they can be 
dangerous.
Ashkan Soltani, an online privacy consultant, conducted a review of 
fifty popular websites. These sites left a little present for each computer that 
searched the Net, including roughly sixty-four tracking technologies, some of 
www.ebook3000.com

which used cookies. This practice is what the techie world refers to as “cookie 
stuffing.” Although cookie stuffing sounds like a fun way to bust your diet, 
this slang actually refers to the practice of stuffing cookies onto your computer 
without your full knowledge. Websites do this to peek at your online habits to 
target you in online marketing efforts. Consumers around the world, although 
resigned to this tracking, are still not thrilled with the idea that their personal 
online interactions can be monetized by companies for profit. In fact, in a 
recent survey a staggering 70 percent of Europeans have said that it is not fair 
that private sector companies profit from their online transactions and personal 
data.40
Most Internet browsers allow you to block or delete cookies and receive a 
notification before a cookie is installed on your computer. There are also several 
free browser plug-ins that you can use to add these features if your browser lacks 
them. One such service is called Ghostery, which works with several popular 
browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.
Searching You Out
Just like the X-ray machine in the airport, search engines can quickly scan 
the contents of your life’s baggage to reveal all kinds of facts in less than fifteen 
minutes.
In a test to show a family how easy it could be to mine their information, 
we searched for the mother’s name, city, and church. We were led to a church 
bulletin, which told us about a charity project she was working on and gave her 
e-mail address. That made it easy to track down her Facebook account. The 
good news is her online persona was positive. Her digital billboard showed a 
health-conscious mom devoted to her family and church, a good neighbor, and a 
good friend. But no matter how good her online image, the search also revealed 
things about her identity that could be used to impersonate her.
Most Internet searches are purposeful and directed, using a specific name or 
topic, not random search terms. Posting thoughts, locations, and other tidbits 
about yourself online makes it easier for a stranger to guess your passwords or to 
target or impersonate you. Perhaps even more disconcerting is that most online 
snoops and scammers want to add to their existing knowledge of you over time, 
and they will patiently stalk and wait until the timing is right to take whatever 
kind of action will help them to take advantage of you.
Organizations, individuals, and criminals use Internet search engines to 
collect information and get clues about your interests and the interests of others 
you let surf the Net on your computer or smartphone. You might also find that 
the search engine providers themselves are using your searching information. 
On most search engines, every time you type a search term, you tell the search 
engine provider something about you. The search engine provider may know 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
56
that you cannot sleep at night, you are interested in new diet fads, and you are 
considering getting a master’s degree online.
In researching this book, we used a tool called Google Ads Preferences and 
were astonished by the stored knowledge Google had about us. Google knew 
that one of us was interested in national security, information security, and child 
safety. Google says that they are not tracking individuals, and they also offer a 
feature that allows you to opt out of their tracking.
Even though Google says it does not track individuals, they do track 
searches performed on your computer. They also store the searches for historical 
trending. So if you use someone’s name plus other terms in a search, Google 
stores the combination of search terms. For example, if you searched “Jane Doe 
+ Drunken Stupor,” that search string remains in the Google archives.
Here’s a tip: If the targeted tracking and historical hoarding by the search 
engines bothers you, check out the search engine DuckDuckGo, which promises 
not to track or gather information about you when you perform a search. Since 
the Edward Snowden revelations about digital data surveillance, DuckDuckGo 
has seen a 600 percent increase in searches using their engine.41
Public Records Exposed
You might be surprised by how much a stranger could learn about your 
family based on public records. If somebody is not sure if they’re getting a good 
deal on a house, they can try the local public records office. The odds are their 
records are online. Your new neighbor can see what you paid for your house 
and get a look at your tax bill. If trolling through local public records sounds 
too cumbersome, aggregation sites such as Zillow.com do all the work for them.
If you have never “Google Mapped” your personal residence, take sixty 
seconds, go to www.google.com/maps, and type in your home address. Are you 
surprised at the stunning detail of your home? This service is not in real time 
(yet), but the quality, detail, and timeliness of the photos can be disconcerting. 
Google uses a mashup of satellite shots and maps and pictures they acquire by 
sending a Google Street View car or van down your actual street to snap por-
traits of your residence. This tool helps you get directions to someone’s house 
complete with landmarks and photos to guide your way. It also gives crooks a 
good look at the best way to break into your house.
In the United States, these images are considered a matter of public record, 
and it is legal for Google to capture them. Where Google may have crossed 
the line was by picking up your wireless network in your house and recording it 
along with your home photo and geographic coordinates. Google has admitted 
to doing this and indicated that it was an accidental glitch in the technology. 
The company has since promised to take measures to stop collecting your wire-
less home network information.

Note that Google has provided a “report a problem” button on their website 
where you can ask for sensitive information regarding a property to be removed 
from the Google Maps and Street View. There have been heated debates in this 
case about the legal basis and protection of privacy for citizens in the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and other countries around the globe. Because of 
privacy concerns that could arise from this technology, 244,000 Germans said 
“no” to Google Street View maps by working through their court system.
ZoomInfo and Spokeo are sites that provide another example of how 
quickly someone can pull together information across the World Wide Web and 
see your life displayed on one screen in seconds. Spokeo calls itself the “white 
pages of people search” (we talk about the site in more detail in chapter 4). 
ZoomInfo bills itself as having the most comprehensive online profiles of com-
panies and people. But, you say, nobody from Spokeo or ZoomInfo has ever 
asked you to fill out a survey. However, you actually do volunteer information 
every day through your online activities such as filling out surveys or setting up 
profiles on social networking and professional sites. Your offline activities, such 
as buying a house, buying a car, or paying taxes, also provide information that 
both services may be able to access.
Could Your Car Betray Your Identity?
There are all types of technologies in our cars these days. That technology helps 
us find our way, allows us to talk on the phone “hands-free,” and controls the 
music that we listen to. Could technology in your car also be watching you and 
betraying your identity?
It is possible that the tech around you, much of which you do not see, could 
be keeping tabs on you. Given today’s technology and the lack of laws regulating 
the use of the data collected about you, you should ask plenty of questions before 
you buy, lease, or rent a car.
The rental car company Hertz rolled out an on-board system that includes 
a fully featured GPS. Also included as a feature that is not currently turned on is 
one with full audio and video capabilities. In theory, this onboard system, if turned 
on, could spy on you by listening and watching you when you’re in your car.
Here are some tips regarding your car and hi-tech exposure:
•  Protect your privacy. You need to understand the authority of customer 
service agents. Do they have the authority to turn the audio and video 
on without an emergency call requesting the service?
•  Avoid hackers. All technology is hackable and high-tech features in 
a car can create a potential entry point for the bad guys, especially if 
they want to target a high-profile person.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
58
•  Ask questions. When buying a new car or renting one, ask ques-
tions about the on-board system. Ask if you can disable or prevent 
snooping.
•  Understand legal protections. In many countries, you have protections. 
For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has 
told businesses they cannot collect audio or video without warning 
customers.

Chapter 3
Behavioral Targeting
[T]he fantastic advances in the field of electronic communication constitute a 
great danger to the privacy of the individual.
—Chief Justice Earl Warren in a 1963 Supreme Court opinion
W
hen you use a free service, there is a quid pro quo. Many services can 
be offered to you for free because you give to them (or they take) 
information about you, a practice called behavioral targeting. They 
use that information to gain sponsors and advertising dollars or to improve their 
overall product to attract more users.
Some companies provide a free service but also offer a paid service with 
more options. This is sometimes called a freemium, in which customers love the 
free service and are willing to pay a little extra for the full-scale version or for 
in-service help. Think Candy Crush and the in-app purchases that help users 
move to a higher level. Both free services and freemium services probably involve 
behavioral tracking behind the scenes.
Have your kids or you used dictionary.com or Merriam-Webster.com to do 
research? Have you visited MSN.com or MSNBC.com to get the latest head-
lines? Those websites are free and helpful, but they expose you to high levels of 
behavioral tracking, according to a study.
In July 2010, the Wall Street Journal began a quest to understand behavioral 
targeting and how deeply it was ingrained into the Internet. They referred to it 
as the “business of spying on customers” and released an ongoing, informative 
series called “What They Know.” You may have read parts or all of that series, 
or you may have read or seen other features about behavioral targeting in the 
news.1
Behavioral targeting has a positive side, but there is also a potential dark side 
that the Wall Street Journal, other media outlets, privacy advocates, and we are 
worried about—the loss of your privacy.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

What’s Going On?
There are many wonderful services on the Internet, many of them free, that you 
can access from your phone, tablet, gaming system, or computer. If you have an 
Internet connection and need to get the latest reviews for a new restaurant, find 
a doctor referral, or make a purchase, chances are you have used the Internet to 
do your research and help you make choices. What many of us do not realize is 
that added convenience comes at a price that goes beyond your Internet access 
charges. Behind those mouse clicks could be software that watches your activi-
ties and reports back to marketing firms.
Behavioral Advertising
This form of online surveillance is known as behavioral advertising or 
behavioral targeting. Behavioral targeting is often added to a company’s existing 
marketing and customer service strategy to learn more about you so they can 
target ads to fit your preferences and sell things to you. They can watch your 
clicks, note how long you stay on a site, and how many times you have been on 
the site without making a purchase. Behavioral targeting also defines the track-
ing mechanism or technology that allows online advertisers, marketing firms, 
and other companies to sell to you more effectively.
Think of behavioral targeting as a secret agent who follows you around 
taking a small snapshot here and there of your Web browsing activities. The 
snapshot may include pages you visit, searches you make, and how long you stay 
on one site versus another. It may also “mashup” that information to create a 
best guess at your current location, the nearest WiFi hot spots, your gender and 
age, and even your unique device ID.
That information, fed to marketers, allows them to customize the ads dis-
played on websites that you visit.
Knowing that consumers are growing increasingly concerned about being 
tracked the Interactive Advertising Bureau announced a new initiative they call, 
“L.E.A.N.,” short for Light, Encrypted, Ad Choice Supported, and Non-Invasive. 
The goal is to create an evolving and better set of guiding principles that consumers 
understand and agree to when creating ads that collect or track consumer behavior. 
Internet users want to opt out. It was recently reported that more than a quarter 
of U.S. Internet users use some type of ad blocker, such as AdBlock or AdBlock 
Plus. Even Apple has deployed ad blocking tools on their newest mobile devices.2
Data Tracking Trends
Behavioral targeting is a key component of the estimated $34.5 billion 
online advertising industry in the United States, according to a recent Juniper 
research report.3

BEHAVIORAL TARGETING

Having companies track your activities is a mixed bag. Most people don’t 
mind giving up some information about themselves for better service. Many 
of us let our grocery store track what we purchase each week by scanning store 
cards during checkout because it might translate into great coupons and savings 
at the checkout counter.
The trend for big Internet companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, 
or Google, is to move your preferences and data into computers under their con-
trol. This concept is sometimes known as the cloud. In the cloud your data might 
reside on both your computer and on a company’s servers, or perhaps only on 
their servers. This can be a great way to offer you easy backups of your informa-
tion, but it also takes away your personal control of how the data are stored and 
what they can be used for.
The collection of information on the Net is not as obvious, and you don’t 
have a one-on-one relationship with online companies in which you provide 
your information knowing what you will get in return. So the first step in under-
standing your comfort level with behavioral targeting is understanding what is 
being tracked, how it’s tracked, and by whom.
According to a Wall Street Journal study, in the United States the top fifty 
U.S. websites install an average of sixty-four pieces of tracking technology onto 
the computers of visitors. In most cases, the tracking happens without warning. 
Roughly two-thirds of those files were installed by 131 companies that make 
money off of tracking consumers.4
If you feel confident that you’re fine because your browser blocks cookies, 
think again! The latest and greatest technology can track your Web browsing 
in real time. The tools can see when you access or browse a web page and then 
scoop up your device’s location and can apply algorithms and other purchased 
data to infer about your income, health, and more. One example of these new 
tools is called beacons. Beacons track everything you do, down to where you 
move or hover your mouse on a web page. There are huge concerns about this 
pervasive tracking. For one, you as the user do not get an option to access the 
data and correct inaccuracies.
The element of big data analytics also plays a role. Many marketers claim 
to anonymize the tracking, but once you merge a few databases together the 
anonymized puzzle pieces form a full picture that can identify a person. In one 
Wall Street Journal study, a researcher indicated that computer programs can 
“de-anonymize” data if provided with thirty-three data elements.5
In 2014 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported on nine data bro-
kers that collect, compile, and sell vast amounts of personal information. One 
of the nine estimated that they have 3,000 data points on every U.S. consumer. 
They know all about you, from your shopping and personal habits to medical 
or health challenges and possibly even your political affiliations and beliefs. The 

Protecting Your Internet Identity

FTC indicated that most consumers have no way to check, correct, or confirm 
the information.6
A huge amount of public concern centers around government snooping 
and the bulk collection and storage of vast amounts of raw data in the name of 
national security. What you may not realize is that the greater threat to your 
privacy is often the collection of your data.
Danger: Data Brokers
Who is collecting your data? They’re called data brokers. They can be 
research firms, Internet marketing companies, advertisers, and trade associa-
tions. The largest firms in this business are Acxiom, Epsilon, and Experian.
These firms can track, collect, collate, connect dots, and analyze your most 
confidential searches and your sensitive personal information. What do they 
do with the data? They package it up and sell it as a commodity. Oftentimes, 
they will anonymize your data but once your data are matched up with other

As you surf online, the benefits of being tracked include being sent deals and 
bargains you might not find on your own. However, if you prefer to keep 
your searches more private, here are some tips that may help you. All of the 
tools listed here, unless otherwise noted, are free.
•  Don’t link across social media accounts.
•  Treat your security questions and answers like passwords and don’t share 
them.
•  Use “Delete Me”: https://www.abine.com/index.html.
•  Use a tool called Privacy Badger that can block trackers: https://www.eff 
.org/privacybadger.
•  Install ad and tracker blocker extensions in web browsers such as Adblock 
Plus or Ghostery.
•  Take advantage of a virtual private network (VPN) such as Disconnect 
(disconnect.me, requires a small fee) to obscure your IP address location.
•  There’s a browser plugin called TrackMeNot that can turn your search 
engine histories into lists of unconnected terms.
•  https://duckduckgo.com is a search engine that does not track you.
•  Try “Google Incognito” to browse in private using Chrome.

databases for purchase, it can quickly lead back to your persona. This multibil-
lion dollar industry operates behind the scenes of every website and mouse click 
or touchscreen swipe we make.
You may not mind filling out a marketing form to get coupons. There isn’t 
anything nefarious about that, right? Over time, however, you are giving up pri-
vate information online and you don’t even know it. They can capture your likes 
and guess at your dislikes. They can see the connections to your closest friends.
What can these data brokers compile? Your religion, ethnicity, politi-
cal affiliations, income, and family medical history, medications, alcoholism, 
depression, the bars you visit, and your purchases. As you click through the 
Web, third parties can grab your clicks and swipes. They can see what you read 
and what you do next. They may also grab the IP address and the device or 
computer ID which they can match up with other databases.
According to a 60 Minutes interview, one company, Exact Data, offers to 
sell a database of names of people with a sexually transmitted disease or a data-
base of people who have recently purchased sex toys.7
How Technology Comes In
In the physical world, many people are concerned about the level of surveil-
lance they feel every time they go to a bank, shopping mall, or work. They see 
video cameras taping their every move.
You may not even mind being videotaped hundreds of times per day if 
it deters crime or helps law enforcement crack a case. But online you are not 
monitored by physical cameras; almost every website you visit on the Internet is 
tracking your online movements, not to prevent crime, but to monitor patterns 
and record your behavior to sell goods and services to you. When you are online 
you don’t see cameras recording your moves because the technology is invisible. 
Tracking happens on a variety of devices: when you’re Web surfing on your 
computer, using your smartphone, gaming with an Internet gaming system, or 
swiping at the screen of a tablet such as the iPad. If you have a mobile device 
that talks to the Internet, just assume your activities are being tracked, even your 
local shopping mall wants to track you. During the 2011 holiday season, a mall 
in California and one in Virginia announced to shoppers that they would be 
tracking customer cell phones as the shoppers walked from store to store. They 
invited shoppers who wanted to avoid tracking to power off their phones.
How Are They Doing It?
Now you know what devices allow you to be tracked, but just how are they 
tracking? You are a key part of the problem or the solution based on what 
you do online each day. The first clue to how behavioral targeting works is to 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
64
understand that you are broadcasting your thoughts, worries, purchases, and life 
through your online actions every day. Every click you make on the Internet 
might create a tracking opportunity based on what sites you visit, what those 
sites’ information collection policies are, and what you do there.
When you visit one site, there may be ten or more companies looking over 
your shoulder and following you around. This is like walking into your favorite 
department store and, while you shop, having a sales clerk follow you around, not-
ing your behavior. That sales clerk could also tap into information from the store’s 
various departments—shoes, clothing, household goods, and so on—as you shop. 
“Female!” shouts the clothing department clerk. “Likes imported shoes,” reports 
the shoe department. “Clearly in the upper-middle-class demographic from the 
handbag she carries, but also likes to rent romances on Netflix because she’s got a 
movie sticking out of her purse,” says the women’s handbags associate.
If this kind of tracking and reporting happened in the physical world, you 
would either call the police to report this strange behavior or, at the very least, 
stop shopping at that store.
Behind the Scenes
Online, who is collecting these data is actually a complex question. It could 
be the federal government tracking you when you go to Whitehouse.gov or 
other federal government sites in an effort to give citizens better service. The 
tracker could be an ad agency trying to scrape up as much information as pos-
sible to add to their databases. Perhaps the company that owns the website is 
watching to help them understand their target markets. Even your own device 
could be “phoning home,” just as E.T. did in the movies, to let the “mother ship” 
know where your phone and you are relative to nearby networks.
Behind the scenes we drop digital cookie crumbs. When you visit a website, 
unbeknownst to you, the website often asks for your IP address, which tells the 
tracking company your physical location while accessing that site. The website 
may note the language setting, the operating system of your device, time zone, 
and more. A great way to avoid this information being scooped up by advertis-
ers is to clear your Web cache and consider trying an anonymous browser. For 
example, the Google Chrome browser offers an incognito mode and Firefox 
offers a private browsing option. You can also disable JavaScript, which prevents 
the collection of some of this information. Keep in mind that some sites will not 
work properly if you disable JavaScript. 
Why You Should Care
Your response to the “what” and the “who” is tracking you at this point might 
be “who cares?” You might not care if a website follows you around to collect 
www.ebook3000.com

BEHAVIORAL TARGETING
65
your viewing preferences to offer you better products or better search results. 
You have become accustomed to the Amazon.com model, which reminds you 
of what you searched for last time, recent purchases, and what purchases other 
people that are “like you” have made.
But before you decide to skip to the next chapter, you might want to read 
more about why this kind of tracking should give you pause.
Information Accumulates
The information tracked by online companies, both reputable and disrepu-
table, aligned with open source information and public records, can make you 
naked online in a split second. We don’t know what the future will bring, but 
the existence of this capability to track your behavior online is more than a little 
bit scary, and you should be on the alert for how it could have an impact on your 
online persona. In a Wall Street Journal article, a reporter talked about the work 
being conducted by a company called [x+1] Inc. (now known as Rocket Fuel).8 
You might not have heard about them, but chances are they know you so well 
you might just blush. In a test run by the Wall Street Journal, a volunteer sub-
mitted one click on a website. The company correctly identified the volunteer’s 
gender, which was female. Of course, it’s a 50–50 shot at getting that fact right, 
but the next set of data elements gave her pause: the software correctly identified 
a rough salary range, noted that she likes to shop at Walmart, and observed that 
she often rents children’s videos.
Each person they tested had many similar details revealed in a spooky way. 
The technology continues to evolve. Tracking Internet visits down to a device 
ID is not the only consideration. Some behavioral tracking software can also 
record your keystrokes while you’re surfing online and then send those clicks and 
screen flicks on your tablet or smartphone off to be consolidated and analyzed 
in minutes.
Follow the Money
One concern is that this snooping could be costing you dollars. For example, 
some travel sites modify search results based on device, purchase history, and 
search history, steering you to higher-priced search results or charging you more 
for room bookings. Orbitz uses your computer type to determine where to steer 
you. They previously steered customers who have a Mac to pricier rooms.9
Computer science researchers from Boston’s Northeastern University 
proved that websites are tracking the online shopping habits of people and will 
charge individuals different prices, depending on what type of device they use to 
access a website. Their search results show that retailers such as Home Depot, 
Sears, JCPenney, Macy’s, CheapTickets, Orbitz, Priceline, Expedia, and Trave-
locity charge higher prices to users on Apple or Android devices. Online retailers 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
66
can and do adjust their prices based on your location, with higher-income areas 
receiving discounted prices.10
You Don’t Have a Choice
Another reason you should be concerned about this pervasive tracking is 
that you, the user, don’t get the option to access the data and correct inaccuracies. 
For example, Healthline is a company that helps marketing and advertising firms 
track people with health issues and then produce targeted ads for prescriptions 
and more. You have no way to correct or eliminate this information.
Understanding the Business Model
Companies using behavioral targeting have several objectives, but their main 
motive is to make money.
Your cell phone company tracks you because they need to know if you will 
retain their services or switch to another carrier. They also use tracking data to 
help build a better network of services. Social networking sites track you to offer 
demographic information to their business partners and sponsors so that they 
can sell to you and to be more competitive against other social networks. Many 
free sites track you to bolster their business case to their advertisers and sponsors 
or to sell your data to others.
What might be most surprising is the fact that a website owner may not 
even be aware of the tracking. After customers began asking about behavioral 
advertising and targeting, several companies decided they needed to double-
check how their site handled customer visits. MSNBC.com and NBCUniversal 
began to monitor how much tracking was happening on their sites. The execu-
tives were astounded at the amount of tracking that happens based on the ads or 
sponsored companies they have included on their websites.
After doing an internal review, the Huffington Post also found similar tracking 
of behavior patterns. They were concerned enough to remove the ad firm Lotame 
Solutions, Inc., after they found that the firm was analyzing comments left on the 
Huffington Post website. Even Edmunds.com, the reputable source of anything 
automotive, found one of their ad providers snooping on their customers.
If this trend involved just a handful of companies, you might not be too 
concerned, but Krux Digital, Inc., looked at popular websites hosted in the 
United States and determined that almost one-third of tracking tools on those 
popular sites were installed by companies with access to that site and not the 
actual owner of the site. This might mean that your favorite sites have no idea 
of the extent of this tracking activity.11
When we used a tool called Lightbeam for research for this book, we found 
that in one minute and twenty-five seconds we had eighty-four third-party sites 
www.ebook3000.com

connected to us after visiting only six sites! We visited one shopping site, one 
social media site, and four news sites. At the end of three minutes of browsing 
the Web and doing normal tasks such as visiting Amazon and Facebook, we had 
113 third-party sites tracking us and we had only visited nine sites.
How fast does it work? Try this quick test: turn off all your privacy tools 
and ad-blocking tools. Start at a favorite news site and notice the ads presented 
there. Next, go to your favorite search engine and search for boots. Go back to 
the news site and you are likely to see an ad for boots there.
Canvas Fingerprinting
Canvas fingerprinting allows a website to create a hidden line of text or a 
graphic that creates a digital token. It saves physical information about your 
computer, including your browser, screen resolution, operating system, and 
installed graphics hardware.
When the digital token is created, the way it gets rendered tells the website 
several things about you. Based on what they grab about you, your digital fin-
gerprint becomes pretty unique. If they match the digital fingerprint with your 
search preferences, websites you visit, and more, they may be able to figure out 
who you are. Identifying you is a matter of math. The more data a company has 
about you, the easier it is to identify you.
How “unique” were we? In our case, when we looked up our canvas fin-
gerprint on the site, https://www.browserleaks.com/canvas, the site said that

YouTube on your Android phone, your daughter visits shopping sites, and your 
uncle visits and wants to check lottery tickets on your home computer, they leave 
behind tracks that can be linked to a profile of you. Often the profile is tied to 
the device ID of the computer, tablet, or phone. Your Web activity patterns are 
then used to judge you.
Bad Customer
Those who run websites believe that, based on your behavior, they can esti-
mate your future behavior and determine whether or not you would be a good 
customer. They may not offer you credit or free shipping because they don’t 
think you will complete a sale or you could pose a potential credit risk.
Bad Behavior
If someone in your house likes to visit gambling or “adult” sites, this could 
create image issues for anyone who uses your computer to go online. Today’s 
technology lets the behavioral tracking companies know that a specific device, 
such as your computer, tablet, or phone, has surfing preferences and habits. 
Although today’s practices and technologies are not quite sophisticated enough 
to track your device behavior and fully integrate it into their decision-making 
process about you as a person or potential customer, we predict that in the 
near future, they will be able to. As the tools improve and directly tie browsing 
behavior to the device owner’s name, you may find that you are denied a job or 
entrance to school because your child or brother used your computer for unsa-
vory activities. We have not seen this happen yet but are observing a disturbing 
trend that could create scenarios where your device’s browsing habits are consid-
ered a specific reflection of your Internet image.

Beside the ease of Internet use and convenience factor, tracking information 
can bring about good. For example, the technology behind behavioral track-
ing has been used to help in the aftermath of the tsunami and nuclear power 
plant disasters in Japan. You can look at the pictures listed by Dark Read-
ing at https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima

Price Discrimination
It is possible for a company, based on what it knows about your behavior, to 
target you and provide a custom offering based on the kind of person they think 
you are. This might not work in your favor if they offer you a deal that is more 
expensive than your neighbor’s deal because they think you are an impulsive 
shopper or wealthy.
Social Engineering and Targeting
Behavioral tracking allows companies to collect data stores that may be 
combined with other data lists to build a profile of you. Tom Owad, a com-
puter consultant, conducted an experiment that shows how these data stores 
could be misused. He did an initial review of the public wish lists on Amazon 
.com. These are handy lists where people can tag items they would like to 
receive as gifts. The lists include the name of the person and his or her city 
and state.
Tom downloaded more than 250,000 wish lists in a day. He spent time ana-
lyzing and consolidating the data he gathered from these lists and added them 
to addresses and phone numbers he found using Yahoo People Search. He was 
able to match much of these data with the Amazon list.12
How could such information be used? What types of books are on your wish 
list? Would you want to be located on a map by a group that opposes the point 
of view in the book that you are currently reading? Each piece of the puzzle, 
your likes and interests, could also be assembled to use in a social engineering 
attack on you.
Bad Citizen
Private companies love personal data, but according to the ACLU, so does 
the government, including the CIA and FBI. According to a news report from 
MyFoxDC.com, Chris Calabrese, counsel to the ACLU’s Technology and 
Liberty Program, notes that “the government actually buys, subscribes to these 
databases and purchases access to these services.”13
You may think privacy advocates are taking this issue too far, but we 
have heard more than one advocate express concern about what govern-
ment and law enforcement can or might do with behavioral tracking data 
in the future. Would you get in trouble if you were on the Web researching 
gangs, listening to gang music, and then drove through a gang neighborhood 
roughly around the same time that a gang committed a crime while you had 
your location-tracking-enabled smartphone or tablet in your car? You left 
a lot of digital clues behind that could point to you, even though you did 
nothing wrong.

How Location and Behavior Tracking Work
When you land on a page that has behavioral tracking behind the scenes, the 
page uses software to scan information sent by your device. This information 
might include the device ID and/or the Internet address the computer uses. The 
software then takes that information and searches against other databases. One 
database might give them your computer’s zip code. Another database may have 
guessed your gender and level of education. Another quick search of an infor-
mation store may reveal a best guess for income and age based on the browsing 
behavior attached to that device ID.

There are many types of cookies, and new ones are being created every day, 
but here are a few you should be aware of:
•  Session Cookies: This cookie is temporary. It follows you around one 
website. When you close your browser, this cookie goes away.
•  Persistent Cookies: Also known as tracking cookies, these will track you all 
around the Internet and are resident even after you close your browser.
•  Secure Cookies: If you visit a secure website whose URL starts off with 
“https,” the cookie follows you around for the duration of a single Internet 
session, and it is encrypted.
•  Zombie or Respawning Cookies: This sounds like a bad horror movie, and 
in practice, it can be. You delete these cookies, but after you do, they 
can re-create themselves on your computer. The most popular creators 
of zombie or respawning cookies are those cool media players on your 
computer that help you to play music or video, including Internet-based 
video. These are typically tied to your Flash Player and are sometimes 
known as Flash cookies.
In 2009, it was estimated that Flash software had been installed on 
roughly 98 percent of all personal computers. Flash is much more preva-
lent on non-Apple computers and mobile devices. Many media players use 
zombie cookies to make the player features operate, remembering your 
audio preferences, for example. However, these cookies also collect informa-
tion about you.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
72
Many sites use a small program called a cookie, which is downloaded to your 
device to identify you and track your actions whenever you visit the site.
In response to privacy concerns, Adobe created a feature called the “Global 
Privacy Settings Panel,” where you can update your privacy settings. A good 
setting to look at is the “Always ask” before Flash Player allows a program to 
access your computer.
When you use the computer in your house, which has a unique device ID 
to connect to the Internet, cookies will keep a record of pages you visit, such 
as medical sites for a list of pediatric doctors, comparison shopping for dia-
pers, searches for early learning educational entertainment videos, and family-
oriented shopping sites. This behavior pattern might indicate that the primary 
user of the device is a parent.
It is difficult to pin all Internet traffic from a single device to a person with 
100 percent certainty. However, this technology is evolving and is getting more 
accurate with each iteration.
The Facebook “Like” and Twitter “Tweet” Buttons
Most sites give you an opportunity to hit “Like” or “Tweet” when you land 
on their home page. If you are a big fan of the site, like their mission, or have 
had a great experience, chances are you clicked on one or both of those buttons. 
Little did you know that your action would allow somebody to track you.
It is estimated that the Like button for Facebook is on roughly 30 percent of 
the top one thousand most-popular Internet sites.14 If you have logged onto 
Facebook or Twitter from a device and then started browsing around the 
D o i n g  t h e  M a t h
Using a deanonymization algorithm, researchers can quickly and accurately 
identify you using pieces of the data puzzle to single you out. In one test 
reported by the Wall Street Journal, a man clicked on a website and the 
behavioral tracking software determined his location, education, rough 
income, and more. This provided enough information that a researcher 
stated it could be used to narrow down a search to sixty-four people in the 
world. The man’s name was never provided, but having someone narrow 
results down to you and sixty-three other people on our entire planet must 
be an unnerving experience.

Internet, that site can collect your browsing information unless you log off. 
Sometimes the tracking is not being done by Facebook or Twitter but hap-
pens through shared apps such as Farmville that you may have added to your 
accounts. It is almost as if you invited someone to follow you around during 
your day to watch you, see what was on your mind, and follow your every move 
on the Internet.
Smartphones and Tablets
There are 5.3 billion mobile phone subscribers globally,15 which is more 
than 75 percent of the world’s population. The statistics do not really indicate 
if there are people that own more than one phone, but it is possible that some 
people have a smartphone provided to them by their employer and a personal 
phone. Depending upon the features of a device, a phone may be broadcasting 
its location and much more.
Not all phones are Web enabled, but consider that roughly 90 percent of all 
mobile subscriptions in the United Kingdom and Western Europe have Internet 
access. For a map view of how cell phone users in four cities around the globe 
use their phones, take a look at the http://www.manycities.org created as part of 
an MIT Lab Research project.
The most popular cell phone applications may startle you. They have changed 
quite a bit in recent years, with phone calls dropping to sixth place. Smartphones 
are now used first to send and receive texts, followed by reading e-mails, surfing 
the Web, and setting an alarm clock. They are also used to send e-mails, check 
the time, use calculator functions, and, coming in at tenth place was checking 
Facebook. While browsing the Web, smartphone or cell phone users enjoy read-
ing the news, searching the Web, shopping online, and watching videos.16
In general, mobile device makers understand the need to act as better gate 
keepers and provide easier ways for users to opt in or opt out. Still there are 
dangers you should be aware of. 
We Know Where You Are
Sometimes the behavior that’s being tracked isn’t online, it’s where you go 
in the physical world. The Apple iPhone and Google Android phones regularly 
“phone home” their locations to company headquarters. Both companies are in 
a race against time to create the go-to source of information for pinpointing a 
person’s location based on cell phone use and building an authoritative source of 
Internet WiFi hot spots.
This type of information can be used to create more accurate maps, provide 
helpful hints on how to get free Internet access, and even push notifications to 
locals about severe weather or other emergencies. But these conveniences come 
at a price: your privacy.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

Google Android-based phones can beacon your data back to Google on the 
hour. Your device’s unique identifier, location, and any nearby WiFi networks 
will be sent to Google. Apple also periodically collects data, including your 
iPad or iPhone’s GPS location and any local WiFi networks. There is a small, 
unencrypted location file on these devices. The data are therefore vulnerable to 
hacking attempts. If you want to see what might be going on with your device, 
check out this tool at http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker to see your 
movements being mapped from your iPhone or iPad.
You Have a Spy in Your House
The research firm Gartner indicates that phone companies track you 
because they want to take advantage of the huge market for location-based ser-
vices. Gartner estimates this market to be roughly $8.3 billion in 2014.
Phone companies may track you for a variety of reasons, including for the 
creation of WiFi hot spot databases. If you are a parent or employer, you may 
be happy to know that, if a phone is in your name, you can track your kids’ or 
employees’ movements based on their phone’s location. (Check with your ser-
vice provider for more details on how to do this.) The MobileMe service (www 
.mobileme.com) offers a find feature for locating iPhones (apparently when 
you have lost your device) that can be used to let you know where your kid’s or 
employee’s iPhone is at any time. This works because your phone often records 
every place you have visited. It records the address, the date, the time, and loca-
tion. Now you know how they can find a lost or stolen phone. 
Tracking capability isn’t limited to smartphones. The MobileMe find fea-
ture also works on the iPad. An app called MobiStealth can be used to monitor 
users that have a Samsung Galaxy. Scientists have proven that once someone 
knows where you’ve been, they can likely predict where you will be going in the 
future.
The Data Exposed
The data that can be collected about you is extensive. Imagine that someone you 
don’t know gets access to this data checklist:
•  Device ID (which is unique and can be traced back to the contract 
holder, subscriber, or purchaser)
•  Gender
•  Income
•  Age
•  Marital status

Companies can use this data checklist to clearly target your needs and anticipate 
life events so they can offer you, for example, a car loan for that teenager who 
just turned sixteen. If the data checklist gets in the wrong hands, however, your 
identity can be exposed and you may become a target of a scam.
High-Risk Internet Activities
During his testimony before a congressional committee on June 18, 2009, Jeff 
Chester, Executive Director of the Center for Digital Democracy, warned that 
behavioral targeting (BT) is growing. A study by Datran Media, which surveyed 
more than three thousand industry executives from Fortune 1,000 brands and 
interactive agencies, found that “65% of marketers use or plan to use behavioral 
targeting. BT is expected to become widely used with online video, mobile 
phones, and online games and virtual worlds, further expanding its data collec-
tion and targeting role.”17
Gaming
To see how far we have come since Chester’s testimony, look no further 
than the companies behind the virtual world of gaming. One study showed that 
Mass Effect 2 had 80 percent of their players using their sophisticated face cus-
tomization program so they could create and change their avatars’ appearances. 
Mafia II keeps track of how long your friend stares at Playboy centerfolds that are 
displayed midgame.18 Did you know that this study of human behavior was hap-
pening? Maybe you or your loved ones would behave differently playing online 
games if you knew that anything you do during your sessions can be tracked, 
cataloged, and stored for future use.
Check-ins
Check-ins are a fun, somewhat cartoonish way to announce your presence 
on a social networking site. By checking in, you can access financial incentives 
or virtual rewards, such as coupons for free drinks or an award making you the 
designated mayor of the doughnut house.
There is a false sense of privacy among some avid check-in fans. When we 
asked several users of check-in about this, they typically responded that only 
their friends could see their whereabouts. However, one user named Jesper 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
76
Andersen found a privacy concern on Foursquare in 2010 when the check-in was 
accidentally broadcasting his whereabouts beyond his friends.
Social Networking
Social networking sites, such as Facebook, allow you to connect with old 
friends and keep up with current ones. They provide a great platform for friends 
and family members who are miles apart to feel as if they connected. However, 
these sites can put you at risk.
Every time you post something to a wall, click the “Like” button, play 
a game, or click on an ad, you are being followed. These services need that 
information to make their business model viable. That model might include 
profiling customers to design products that might do well in the marketplace, 
pushing ads at you to get you to buy something, or modifying their customer 
service message to appeal to the mainstream. In the case of Facebook, there are 
several documented cases in which user data, unknown to those users, have been 
cataloged and provided to third-party companies. One trick to watch out for is 
when new releases and features are announced that ask you to “opt in” to receive 
the full benefits of the new feature. Opting in can provide an open door for these 
services to violate your privacy.
If you are wondering how to reclaim your privacy, there is a neat tool at 
www.reclaimprivacy.org that you can use to scan your Facebook settings and get 
pointers to make your profile a little more secure.
But it’s not just greedy capitalists who want to track your moves through 
behavioral marketing and targeting methods. There was a recent kidnapping 
case in which police believe one person’s social networking activities made him a 
target. The kidnappers were actively using behavioral targeting on their victim’s 
activities on social networks to learn about his daily routines and to plan their 
crime.
Retail Sites
Have you done any online shopping recently? If so, you probably weren’t 
alone. Go to www.networkadvertising.org to see a list of who is looking over 
your shoulder. Entities that are directly related to retail sites you have visited 
watch what you do, even if you don’t purchase anything.
CNN did a report on pricing customization and tested a retail shopping 
site.19 They found that, based on the sites people had visited before shopping 
on the site, the person might find themselves presented with higher or lower 
pricing. One frequent shopper deleted his tags from his computer and noticed 
pricing actually went down on a DVD by roughly four dollars.
New retail models are emerging to respond to the privacy questions. Apple’s 
mobile operating system iOS8, is said to contain a feature that sends random,

phony MAC addresses to Wi-Fi networks to protect Apple users from being 
physically tracked through malls while they shop.20
Modifying Your Profile and Settings
Companies have started to create options for setting your profile in the “prefer-
ences” section of their sites. If you typically use Google or Yahoo!, you can take 
just a few minutes out of your day to check and change what information they 
have collected about your browsing habits. Other companies are also following 
the lead to allow you to see what they know about you. They typically offer you 
a profile, and you can review it to see what they think they know about you and 
edit it. This is a recent enhancement based on the general public expressing con-
cerns over privacy. Many of these sites also give you the option of asking them to 
stop tracking you. Of course, they will probably still track you to a certain extent, 
but not at the same level of detail.
Change Your Ways on Google and Yahoo
We have highlighted the procedure for modifying your settings on two 
popular sites, Google and Yahoo!, so you can see how this works.
•  On Google: Go to the Ads Preferences manager at https://www.google 
.com/settings/u/0/ads. You can add, remove, and edit your “interests” 
that Google has recorded. You can also ask the service to stop tracking 
you.
•  On Yahoo!: When you open up your profile, it will tell you what Yahoo! 
thinks your computer’s operating system is, which browser you use, and 
your interests. It will not allow you to add a new interest, but you can 
remove the ones they guessed at by going to https://help.yahoo.com/
kb/helpcentral.
Use the Tools
You can also leverage tools to help you manage how you are tracked and 
what information about you is gathered and passed back to marketers. Some 
tools to consider are Abine, Inc., at www.abine.com and TRUSTe at www 
.truste.com.
We do admit that fixing your behavioral profile on sites may feel like playing 
the whack-a-mole game. You fix one profile only to find that another company 
or service has created a profile about you that you need to edit, and sometimes 
that option is not even available to you. It may be worth your while, at least once 
a year, to review and track what is in your behavioral profile on the sites you use 
most often.

Opera, Chrome, or Safari that provide similar or better features. The browser 
features change often, but most share certain functions you can use for privacy 
and security. Here are two important features to look for in your browser.
•  Version: Keep the version of your browser up-to-date for the most 
advanced security and privacy setting options. You can check your ver-
sion by clicking the Help menu and choosing About (Browser Name).
•  Options or Preferences: Look for your browser’s Options or Prefer-
ences feature to change its security and privacy settings. Most brows-
ers will allow you to decide when and if cookies are installed on your 
computer and allow you to delete some or all cookies currently on your 
system. You may also be able to opt out of ads or pop-ups.
You can also go to the site networkadvertising.org and use their tools to 
opt out of targeted ads. Keep in mind that sites remember to avoid sending you 
targeted ads by installing a cookie on your computer to keep track. So you now 
have a tracking cookie to help fulfill your request not to be tracked by cookies.
Four Tips for Protecting Privacy
Here are four important areas you should address to provide the basic tools 
for protecting your online privacy:
1.  Apps: Only download apps that you need to have and make sure 
the source of the mobile smartphone application (called apps by the 
industry) is reputable. Only turn on location tracking services when 
absolutely necessary.
2.  Data Usage: Monitor data usage to see if the mobile device sends out 
data even while you’re sleeping; this could be a sign that an app is 
broadcasting your location and other information.
3.  Settings: Check your privacy and location settings to make sure they are 
set at the level with which you are comfortable.
4.  Operating System: Stay up-to-date on the latest operating system 
updates so you have the latest features for privacy.

Self-Examination
O
ver time, each of us develops an Internet persona. Sometimes the 
digital image of your life is accurate. Sometimes the image highlights 
one aspect of our lives above others, offering a true, yet incomplete 
picture. Occasionally, an image is a complete fabrication that can have harmful 
consequences.
How can you tell what you are exposing online and what online persona 
you’ve created? You must take the time to find out what is being written about 
you and what images of you are flashing across the world. Have you been 
stripped bare by your own online revelations or overexposed by someone you 
thought was a friend? You can’t understand or modify the world’s perception 
of you until you’ve done some online sleuthing. Scouring the Web for informa-
tion about yourself is the first step to understanding and managing your online 
image.
What Can Go Wrong: A Case Study
Former NBC Nightly News weekend anchor John Seigenthaler read a disturbing 
Internet report about his father that was totally false. His father, also named 
John Seigenthaler, was a prominent journalist and founder of a successful public 
relations firm who once served as Robert Kennedy’s administrative assistant. 
Seigenthaler Sr. had even been a pallbearer at Robert Kennedy’s funeral.1
The Seigenthalers were therefore shocked to read an entry for Seigenthaler 
Sr. in the online encyclopedia site Wikipedia that stated that Seigenthaler Sr. 
“was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of 
both John, and his brother, Bobby.” The article went on to incorrectly report 
that “John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1971, and returned to the 
United States in 1984.”2 The same false reports were repeated on the websites 
Answers.com and Reference.com.
It is impossible to know how many people read these reports and developed 
a false opinion of the Seigenthaler family as a result. According to an article he 
www.ebook3000.com

SELF-EXAMINATION
81
wrote in USA Today in 2005, the senior Mr. Seigenthaler referred to these false 
reports as “an Internet character assassination.”3
These false statements were available on certain Wikipedia sites for 132 days 
until the Seigenthalers discovered them and requested that they be removed. 
Seigenthaler Sr. did not create or post these lies online. He did nothing to earn 
or publicize the false aspects of his online persona, and he was able to correct the 
misstatements relatively quickly on discovery. However, any person researching 
him or his family on Wikipedia during those 132 days would have received com-
pletely false and scurrilous information and would have taken away an entirely 
incorrect impression of the man.
Wikipedia is a site that many people have used for basic research, treating 
the information there as undisputed fact. For the Seigenthaler family, sophis-
ticated professional managers of media and public image, Wikipedia became 
an unchecked medium for propagating harmful lies and damaging one man’s 
reputation.
John Seigenthaler Sr. has written extensively about the false postings on 
Wikipedia and about his attempts to find the people responsible for defaming 
him. His interviews on the topic for CNN and National Public Radio demon-
strated the dark side of how the Internet can be misused as a research tool, and 
it highlighted how quickly libelous statements can streak across the Internet.
The Seigenthalers corrected the online lies, but here’s the point of this 
story: the family would not have been able to address this problem if they didn’t 
know it existed. They were fortunate that a friend notified them about the false 
Wikipedia entry. But it’s not wise to wait for your friends to tell you about online 
damage to your reputation. Everybody should conduct a regular inventory of his 
or her online persona.
Where Are You Now?
In today’s social media saturated world, many people’s Internet persona is a 
product of their own posting, liking, hash tagging, and uploading. If you have a 
favorite social media site, then you have probably posted significant information 
about yourself, and anyone with access to the site would also be able to see your 
friends and family, your relationship status, and many aspects of your personal-
ity. There are likely to be pictures and video as well, either posted by you, or 
tagging you.
So take a close look at the entire history of your own postings. First confirm 
that your site is managed on a friends-only setting, so that you can limit and 
control the number and type of people who can see what you post and whose 
comments can appear on your page. If your social media site is open to the 
public, think about what would happen if important people in your life saw the 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
82
content of your postings. Would their review of your publications affect your 
life in a negative way? If so, then flip the switch and make your site private, or 
clean it up so the worst postings—bad temper, admissions of drug use or alcohol 
abuse, sexual statements, off-color or hateful jokes—are no longer online and 
attributable to you. We all slip sometimes and post things that we would regret 
later or that didn’t come out the way we intended. The current rules of social 
media sites always allow you to remove your own posts, so that you will not be 
stuck with your mistake forever. So take advantage of the rules and scrub down 
your social media presence.
Then do it again for any other social media companies whose services you 
use. Also remember to close out old accounts if you are not using them anymore. 
And keep in mind that even if you remove a picture from your social media feed, 
the same picture may have been copied by another person, or it may remain 
available to the Internet for a period of time in the memories of search engines 
like Google or Bing.
Surprising Sources
You may think that the only information about you online comes from postings 
on your own Facebook page, but you might be surprised what information you 
find when you check yourself out online. You might just find more than you 
bargained for.
Snapshots from Friends
Although Internet references about you may not be in your complete con-
trol, you can still influence those who post them. For example, if your friends or 
family include unflattering or embarrassing pictures of you on their social media 
sites, blogs, or personal Web pages, you can ask them to remove the pictures.
Most friends will understand if you want to remove that picture of you at a 
bar, hoisting an appletini high in the air, if the friends know that you are about 
to apply for a job and the company human resources director is likely to be look-
ing for information about you on the Internet.
Friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors may also be posting comments 
about you online. Some of these comments may be hosted on your own social 
media page, but many will be viewable on others’ pages or the pages of your 
mutual friends. Many people are willing to help you clean up your online per-
sona when you express concern about the comments. Keep your friends close.
Big Brother
Most, if not all, of the contacts you have made with the government are 
recorded somewhere, and many of those records are available online. Some

83
of these government databases are password protected or they otherwise limit 
access, so a search for your name would not list the information they contain 
about you. However, people who know what they are looking for can unearth a 
vast trove of personal data from government websites.
If you ever started a company, served as a director of a nonprofit organiza-
tion, or reserved a business name in your state, then information about you is 
probably accessible at the website of the Secretary of State. The same site would

So what is Wikipedia, and why can it be used to spread false information? 
Wikipedia was started in 2001 as a free, collaborative online encyclopedia. 
The site’s primary rule is to strive for a neutral point of view in its treatment 
of all subject matter. The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation operates the site, 
and it does not accept commercial advertising. Wikipedia claims to have an 
accuracy rate similar to the Encyclopedia Britannica, and there is no question 
that the online format allows for a timely, updated description of a topic that 
matches a fast-moving, information-based society.
In 2011, Google published a list of the most-visited websites in the 
world, excluding adult sites and Google’s own. The fifth most-visited site 
on the list was Wikipedia. With more than 18 million articles at this writ-
ing (3.4 million articles in English), Wikipedia is both revered and reviled 
as an online resource. Both the strength and the weakness of Wikipedia 
arise from its unique structure as a collaborative resource. The term wiki 
describes a website built on special software allowing contributors to add to 
the website’s content using an Internet browser.
The site can provide immediate and often comprehensive information 
about subjects as diverse as professional cyclists or obscure mountain peaks, 
modern politicians or ancient cities, movie quotes or named hurricanes. 
However, although some Wikipedia articles are seriously researched and 
written by professional historians, geologists, or other trustworthy academic 
sources, the vast store of information is written by non-experts or people 
interested in pushing a particular agenda. In addition, although Wikipedia 
has a staff of editors and it responds to complaints of inaccuracy, Wikipedia 
articles are not always closely reviewed and edited. Therefore, while millions 
of entries are entirely accurate and complete, Wikipedia is typically not 
treated as a trusted resource for serious academic study.

have records about you if you ran for office, lobbied state legislators, or became 
a notary public. If you have registered a car, secured your commercial driver’s 
license, or ordered personalized license plates, then your information is likely to 
be searchable at your state’s department of motor vehicles. If you run a restau-
rant, your sanitation scores may be posted on the website for the local county 
inspector’s office.
Keep in mind that, no matter what you do, some government information 
is completely beyond your control to affect or change in any way. For example, 
if you are a homeowner, your county may choose to list all home purchase prices 
and tax valuations online. You are unlikely to convince the county to stop dis-
playing the price of your house unless you can demonstrate that there’s a serious 
error in the data.
It’s a Crime
If you’ve been convicted of a crime, you may be covered by different rules. 
Hamilton County, Ohio, contains the city of Cincinnati and publishes a list 
of deadbeat parents who have been held in contempt of court or have been 
convicted of nonsupport for failing to meet their child support obligations. 
The Hamilton County sheriff’s office allows full Internet searches or browsing 
through a list of names and addresses and includes the type of official ruling 
made against each person. At the time of this writing, the list has more than 
2,500 members. According to the sheriff’s website, all people on the list are 
classified as “wanted” and could be arrested on sight by law enforcement. Not 
all counties make it this easy to find the names and addresses of child support 
truants, but the federal child support enforcement laws make lists of habitual 
scofflaws available to law enforcement, who, in turn, may publicize the lists.
Of course, official criminal records are also moving online. Registered 
and convicted sex offenders may desperately desire to separate records of their 
convictions from Internet searches for their names, but most states will con-
tinue to publish these data, no matter how damaging it may be to the former 
convict’s current reputation. It is likely that you can quickly find a map of all 
of the convicted sex offenders in your neighborhood and review the details of 
their convictions.
State prisons and jails in larger counties usually post their “inmate 
lookup” tool online so you can find the status of your loved one quickly and 
easily. California offers sex offender searches and information in many lan-
guages. A public nudity conviction would clearly land you a place on your 
county’s website (and probably on the local newspaper and television station 
websites as well). The Florida attorney general lists the ten most-wanted 
criminals on its website, along with press releases discussing successful 
prosecutions. You can find public records online for people who have been 
www.ebook3000.com

SELF-EXAMINATION
85
convicted of crimes, those who have been arrested in sting operations, and 
individuals who are currently being pursued by police but may not yet have 
been arrested or convicted.
Although the government posts official records, private groups and indi-
viduals aggregate the public data into further lists. For example, an organization 
called the Violence Policy Center keeps lists of people with licenses to carry 
concealed handguns who were convicted of killing with those same guns. The 
site includes the names of killers and victims, the locations and descriptions of 
the crimes, and a listing of mass shootings carried out by concealed gun permit 
holders. It is likely that we will see more of this type of website as the Internet 
matures and organizations use the vast store of public data to make political or 
social points or to argue for changes in the law. Once your name is listed on a 
public record, there may be no limit to the number of ways that information is 
displayed online.
Victims of Crime
Victims of crime are often shielded from having their names displayed, but 
certain categories of victims, such as the missing and the murdered, are more 
likely to appear online. Various states post missing-persons directories that often 
show missing people’s names and the circumstances of each person’s disappear-
ance. We all hope that information about us or our families does not appear in 
these online databases, but if it does, it is available for anyone to see.
Your Day in Court
Any attempt to explore your Internet persona must include a search for all 
court decisions to which you were a party, and even those in which you may 
have appeared as a witness. Interacting with these public records may show you 
a new side of yourself.
Of all three branches of government in the United States (executive, legisla-
tive, and judicial), the judicial branch is the one most likely to host your infor-
mation or list your name. You could appear in the public record for testifying at 
a legislative hearing or petitioning your state’s public utilities commission, but 
your name is more likely to be made public if you are involved with the courts 
in some way. This is true even assuming that you’ve never had contact with the 
criminal courts, have never been arrested, or have never even been pulled over 
for a traffic violation.
Millions of marriages in the United States end in divorce, and the records 
of divorce and family law proceedings are often posted online. If a family law 
matter is settled or remains decided at the lower court without appeal, then 
the records are likely to be public but only available for personal viewing at the 
county clerk of court’s office. However, if one side appeals the decision, then 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
86
family law court of appeals decisions are much more likely to appear online, 
although often not in easily searchable formats.
State Supreme Court decisions are even more likely to appear online. If you 
have been involved with a divorce matter that was appealed, you should visit 
the website for the relevant county court system and search for your records so 
that you can know what others could find out about you. As you might imagine, 
divorce cases can be packed with emotional outbursts and the financial details 
and demands of both husband and wife. All these details can be found in many 
published court decisions.
Civil cases arising from automobile accidents, deals gone bad, business 
battles, or product liability can also produce case decisions that appear online 
and describe the situations and even the personalities of the parties involved in 
each case.
For example, in the 1996 English libel case of Berkoff v. Burchill, the defen-
dant, a film critic, had repeatedly called the plaintiff film director ugly and was 
sued for saying so. The court allowed the suit to proceed to conclusion, finding 
that calling a person “hideous-looking” could hurt his self-esteem and his earn-
ing potential. The entire case is reported in many places online and is searchable, 
which is likely to cause more problems for the reputation of the plaintiff than 
the original remarks. Court cases show us at our most vulnerable—vain, greedy, 
angry, and frustrated—and online court decisions may be the worst possible 
additions to our online images, but it’s important that you know that they are 
public records.
Databases and Organizational Records
Consider that some sites on the Internet exist to collect information on 
people to publish for the public good, or to sell. These sites have not asked your 
permission to use your name and the information about you.
To find this information, you should think about what actions you have 
taken that are likely to be collected in a public database or held for consideration 
by a wide group of people. Some database companies learn about you and your 
family for their profit. They collect databases that you cannot find by running 
an Internet search on one of the major search engines but that contain deep and 
personal information about you and your family.
A perfect example of this type of data-heavy website is Ancestry.com. 
Ancestry.com calls itself the world’s largest history resource and is one of doz-
ens of genealogy sites that profess to help people find their roots by learning 
as much as possible about their parents, grandparents, and generations before. 
As you might expect, Ancestry.com provides databases of marriage, birth, and 
death records from multiple countries to allow you to trace your family line 
back through time. It also includes census records and voter lists going back

87
into the 1790s, immigration records, passport lists and ship passenger lists from 
before the U.S. Civil War, and family trees for reference. All of these tools can 
take you back in time and help you to find your family, but they also include a 
database of school yearbooks, where you can find pictures of yourself, your sib-
lings, or even your mother in second grade or graduating high school.
These database sites featuring genealogy, military history, regional informa-
tion, or any collection of useful information can be used to find out more about 
you and your family. These sites are growing as they collect more information 
from books and records, building them into databases and making them search-
able online. Some of these sites are slickly professional like Ancestry.com, and 
others are collected by amateur historians.
In fact, every group that you ever joined, from the Campfire Girls to the 
YWCA, to the Daughters of the American Revolution, may have a record of 
your participation, and more organizations’ records are moving online every year. 
Your workplace may have a biographical page describing your talents to the 
world. Your church, temple, mosque, or ashram may list you in the membership 
or leadership rolls and show pictures of you and your world-famous potato salad 
at the last potluck dinner event. Every group membership that a researcher finds 
online tells more about you.
Some group memberships reveal more than others. Some affiliations speak 
to your level of wealth or social class, whereas others tell people about your eth-
nic background. Others will provide information about your children, spouse, or 
pets. You could be a member of a singles club, a belly-dancing class, or a trivia 
team, all with an online presence or pictures from their latest event. If you are 
active in your labor union, Internet viewers know about your work life. Your 
high school or college could be congratulating you for your promotion at work 
in their online alumni newsletter or thanking you for leading the twentieth 
O f f l i n e  D a n g e r s
You may be happy that people can easily learn about your club memberships 
or religious affiliations. But even if you don’t mind people knowing about 
your memberships, you still may not want a casual researcher to know where 
to find you next Wednesday night because they see you are a regular player 
at the senior center’s bingo night. Expressing your affiliations online can 
lead people to find you in real life.

probably reflected in the website databases of your favorite organizations.
Exposure by Shopping
Think about what you bought this week. You may have bought diapers and 
baby food. Maybe you bought oil filters and fan belts to work on your car or 
purchased dress patterns or a book about dealing with depression.
Anyone who is watching our purchasing habits can learn a great deal about 
our lives. It is unlikely that you would regularly buy diapers and baby food if you 
did not have a baby at home. An observer can infer what model car you drive by 
the auto parts you buy. And it would not take the deductive powers of Sherlock 
Holmes to conclude that a person who bought a book on depression is coping 
with this condition in himself or herself or somebody near to him or her.
When we discuss revelation of your secrets through shopping, we are not 
describing information that is available to the general public. While a nosey 
neighbor and a prospective employer may be able to read your public govern-
ment data, your social media, and run a Google Images search to see what 
pictures have been tagged with your name, they will not have access to your 
shopping information. So your purchases may not provide clues to your person-
ality to just anyone.
However, all types of retailers and other marketing companies, including 
search firms like Google, grab and keep this information, and they use it to 
supplement a profile of you that was created long ago. There are also companies 
called data aggregators whose entire business is comprised of collecting informa-
tion about people and selling that information. For data aggregators, sometimes 
your data are sold directly connected to your name or your home, and sometimes 
they are bundled with the data of many people who have similar traits to yours. 
For example, a restaurant many want a list of people who have Googled Mexican 
restaurants in the past six months in your town so it could send them a coupon. 
Or a political party may want a list of men who own pick-up trucks so it can 
send them a solicitation for donations.
Finally, a crook who has installed snooping software on your computer can 
determine your shopping habits and use those data to his advantage. Special 
spyware can follow your movements online and send it to whoever installed the 
software onto your system. If you buy an expensive item and have it shipped to 
your house, the crook could be waiting for it.
How Your Shopping Habits Reveal You
You are revealing a great deal about your activities by committing your 
hard-earned resources to a product or service and exposing information about 
your lifestyle through what you buy. And most people have the items they buy

online sent to their homes, handing their addresses to companies and possibly 
thieves.
Why would anyone want to learn about you from your shopping habits? In 
fact, such knowledge is the goal of many organizations. When you purchase a 
book or music from Amazon.com, the company is building a profile of you based 
on your buying habits, and this profile allows them to target you with advertis-
ing that they believe is more likely to spur you to buy additional items. As stores 
and advertisers grow more sophisticated, they merge the information they know 
about your online buying behavior with your life and purchases in the physical 
world. If they can predict your behavior based on past purchases, then maybe 
they can influence future purchases.
Who’s Looking?
Consider the trail of sales information you are leaving on the Internet. 
When you buy shoes online, it may not only be the shoe store that notes the 
transaction but also the bank that holds your credit card and the managers of 
other sites you may have visited that are tracking your movements online. Any 
of these companies may be passing on the information (a) that you are willing to 
purchase items online, (b) how much you are willing to spend, (c) your method 
of payment, (d) the exact nature and category of the item that you bought 
(including shoe size), (e) what type of online store you are visiting (electronic 
boutique or Amazon-like superstore), and (f) what sites you visited before and 
after your purchase. Although some of the same information may be collected 
and shared from a regular shoe purchase at a store in the mall, it is not as easy 
to process and not available to as many different parties.
Given this knowledge, if there are products and services that you want to 
acquire but that you do not want associated with your name, then you are bet-
ter off not purchasing them online. Although online shopping may be more 
anonymous in certain ways—you do not have to physically expose yourself by 
walking into an embarrassing store or parking your car in the lot—your Internet 
movements and purchases are more easily monitored and recorded without your 
knowledge or consent. Internet purchases are tied to your online access account, 
your e-mail account, the special number that identifies the computer device 
you are using, and ultimately can be tied to your name. You should keep this 
accountability in mind when deciding how and where to spend money.
In addition, you should think about the items and services you purchased 
online. The last trip to Florida you planned at Priceline.com and that kitty 
condo delivered from the Internet PetSmart may be adding to your online 
persona. Take account of who might have learned of your purchases online and 
what they might say about you. You can influence how much data are available 
about you online by choosing how and when to spend your money.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

Of course, as marketers and retailers learn more about how to collect your 
information online, they develop an insatiable appetite for information collected 
from every corner of your shopping life. Always remember that when you receive 
a discount, your shopping information may be paying for that discount. Why 
do you think that your local grocery store has a VIP program where they scan 
your card for a discount on your purchases? They are capturing and using that 
information, and they may even be selling it to third-party data aggregators. 
Who would buy diapers unless they had a baby at home? People with babies are 
susceptible for buying other baby-related (or maybe sleep-related) items.
So aside from these information gathering devices that you use yourself—
like the grocery VIP card—stores are finding new ways to capture data about 
you out here in the nondigital world by using digital technologies. For example, 
digitization allows a store to install cameras that not only capture your image, 
but also use facial recognition technology to follow you around the store to see 
where you spend the most time, and to tie your face to your name when you use 
your credit card at the checkout counter. Then these data are combined with 
data the store holds from your online shopping habits, providing a better picture 
of your purchasing habits.
Some stores take this even further by pinging your smartphone when you are 
in the store, and not only combining these data with the facial recognition data, 
but following your smartphone to the next store you visit, and recognizing you 
the minute you return to the original store. Digital shopper tracking has started 
on the Internet, but it has become so valuable that retailers are finding ways to 
mimic the online shopping data capture at their brick-and-mortar stores.
Data Mining for Fun and Profit
It’s not just retailers who are collecting information about your online hab-
its. If you think about it, so much of what you use online is free—search engines, 
mortgage calculators, news services, and more—that you have to wonder how 
these sites make their money. Once they have gathered a herd, how do they milk 
it? The answer for many of these sites is data mining. Also known by industry 
terms big data and data analytics, data mining involves gathering information 
and selling it to others, and it’s big business, with Google as perhaps its largest 
online practitioner.
In a 2010 Time magazine story, writer Joel Stein called a number of data 
mining companies that were stealthily collecting information about him “taken 
from the websites I look at, the stuff I buy, my Facebook photos, my warranty 
cards, my customer-reward cards, the songs I listen to online, surveys I was 
guilted into filling out and magazines I subscribe to.”4 Stein found that many 
companies were collecting this information and making assumptions about him, 
some accurate and others inaccurate. One company pegged Stein and his wife as 
www.ebook3000.com

91
liking gardening, fashion, home decorating, and exercise, whereas others noted 
that he rents sports cars and buys intimate apparel.
Stein notes that there is now a “multi-billion-dollar industry based on the 
collection and sale of this personal and behavioral data” and that each of these 
pieces of information is sold for about two-fifths of a cent to online advertisers. 
The information is linked to his browser while he is visiting sites online, and 
that information is used to display advertisements that are most likely to entice 
him to click through to a purchasing page and buy a targeted product or service. 
He notes how creepy this online knowledge stalking can be, writing that “right 
after I e-mailed a friend in Texas that I might be coming to town, a suggestion 
for a restaurant in Houston popped up as a one-line all-text ad above my Gmail 
inbox.”5
Data analytics has only grown in importance for businesses since Stein wrote 
that article in 2010. Two years later, the Harvard Business Review was calling 
the data scientist “the sexiest job of the twenty-first century.”6 And by 2015, 
Google’s senior vice president of global marketing, Lorraine Twohill, is quoted 
by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company saying, “The tools available to 
marketers today are extraordinary. They know far more about their consumers 
than ever before. They are able to have a much more meaningful, two-way con-
versation. It’s definitely the golden age for marketing in many ways.”7
As observed throughout this book, capture of your information and finding 
meaningful ways to use it, combine it with other data, and learn more about you 
is becoming more deeply sophisticated each year, as retailers and marketers learn 
from the way they used your data in the past. You can safely assume that all the 
data tracking described by Stein in 2010 is happening now in a way that is even 
more useful to the marketers and probably more intrusive to your privacy. A 
“golden age” for marketing means an unprecedented amount of information on 
consumers is being collected.
Every piece of information about you has value to somebody and adds to the 
online image of who you are and what you do.
Searching for Yourself
When asked where to look on the Internet if you want to reveal secrets about 
someone, Miami resident Vincent Volpi of the Private Investigation Company 
of America (PICA), an agency with twenty-four fully staffed, international 
regional headquarters and more than three hundred correspondents in cities 
worldwide, stated:
I’d look for media articles in all languages and court cases in all venues where 
the person has lived or done business. There are no better sources than spurned 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
92
lovers, wives, business partners or competitors. Everything has to be taken and 
presented in context and verified, but these are where the secrets lie and will 
be talked about. The media stories would be somewhat self-validating. Court 
testimony as well.
Volpi said that investigators build on what they find in media and court records 
by talking to the people involved. Civil, domestic, and criminal courts can 
provide detailed information about our worst moments and failings, and court 
records of all sorts are becoming easier to search and find online.
Where to Start
When asked where his investigators would begin exploring online to find 
information about a person of interest, Volpi said, “We would run the routine 
searches that anyone sophisticated with the Internet would run and we might 
utilize some of the commercially available sites depending upon where those 
inquiries led us. There are many services, such as Intelius, that harvest quite a 
bit of information from generic sources and can lead you to places where you can 
use human intelligence gathering to get more valid facts. Also, there are many 
proprietary consolidators of information like LexisNexis that, when creatively 
used, can be a big help. So can PACeR. So can various services that are offered 
through the Net where someone actually goes out and hand-searches court 
records.” For deep searches, according to Volpi, PICA investigators can start 
with these cost-effective Web tools, then “resort more to Humint [human intel-
ligent gathering] and contacts and old-fashioned ‘gumshoe’ work.”
You can identify who you are online by using tools that professional investi-
gators rely on every day and tools that you use as you browse the Web.
Your next step is to use those tools to begin to build a profile of your online 
persona.
Following the Trail You Left
When exploring your online persona, visit any sites that you have published 
online. Ask yourself whether you:
•  have your own website, your own Twitter profile, or your own profes-
sional biography page through work;
•  are linked into others on LinkedIn;
•  have posted your face on Facebook;
•  have an online journal or a place where you publish your deepest, most 
emotional thoughts;
•  are contributing recipes to Cooks.com;
•  have left a profile on eHarmony or another online dating site;
www.ebook3000.com

SELF-EXAMINATION
93
•  sell handmade purses or landscape paintings on eBay or run a com-
mercial site where people can buy your goods;
•  are leaving comments on sports pages, political discussions, or local 
government websites; each of these online activities leaves a trail, so 
you should make a list of any and all such sites.
When you have found and listed all the websites where you have posted 
information about yourself, analyze the depth of your participation in each site. 
How much information about you is included in each site? Examine whether 
you are participating actively in the site, making groups of friends and entering 
into public chats, or if you only listed a small “billboard” about yourself and took 
no further action.
Make a special note of those Internet places where you are the most reveal-
ing about yourself. You could be giving away information about yourself every 
day on a site through your friendships, your comments, your pictures, or your 
open dialogues. If you are blogging or producing an online journal, then you are 
likely to be giving people access to the most important facts of your life and your 
daily thoughts, frustrations, and desires. Think about the picture that would 
be painted of you if someone connected these sites together, learning about 
your emotional life and frustrations from your online journal, your workplace 
priorities from LinkedIn, and the identity of your friends and family through 
Facebook.
Going Visual
Uploading multimedia can be especially revealing. Pictures and videos 
show the people you are with, the parties you attend, the clothes you wear, and 
the places you hang out. Family reunion shots expose all of your relatives, the 
warmth (or coolness) of the interactions between you, and often the details of a 
relative’s house and its physical location. Automobiles included in photographs 
can say much about your personality—whether you are a Corvette person, an 
electric car person, or a minivan person—how much you spend on a car and in 
what condition you maintain it. Photos at work can show your ID badge with 
company identification numbers, and shots of your house can reveal your street 
address. Pictures of you at the beach generally show more skin than you might 
be comfortable exposing to coworkers.
Exposing Likes and Dislikes
Sometimes it’s not what you say or what you show that uncovers you, but what 
you enjoy. Think about what products, people, publications, videos, organiza-
tions, or jokes you have claimed to “like” online.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
94
Many social networking sites provide countless opportunities for you to 
pass jokes or pictures on to your friends and to register your approval of the 
latest trend or dance or YouTube video. Content aggregation sites that provide 
Web-surfing accounts such as Tumblr or StumbleUpon can reveal much about 
your personality by showing a stream of the websites and pictures that you find 
appealing online, and under their default privacy settings, nearly anyone can see 
your preferences.
Certain music sites operate the same way. You can discover much about a 
person’s personality by knowing whether they prefer mainstream country music to 
1940s swing or obscure modal religious chanting. You can learn even more if you 
know what photographs or videos appeal to that person. Pay attention to the mes-
sages you are sending to online observers based on the preferences you divulge.
It’s in the Mail
Correspondence is another medium for leaving an impression online. 
E-mail, private messaging on social media sites, text messaging, chat, and other 
B o d y  L a n g u a g e
A recording of you singing a karaoke song can reveal many things about you: 
it’s one thing to read a printed profile of a person and an entirely different 
thing to see that person, to hear her, and to watch her laugh and move. 
Social scientists have repeatedly shown how much information, both intel-
lectual and emotional, humans glean from seeing the expression of another 
human.
Dr. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco started 
the Diogenes Project to document how much information we can learn from 
reading faces. He has tracked the forty-three facial expressions that humans 
can make and what each expression says about what we are thinking.* 
Looking into a face we see information about health and happiness, about 
taste and fashion, about expression and emotion. With a picture, we have an 
opportunity to read information that the subject did not even know she was 
revealing. The Web is a visual and auditory medium, allowing us to make 
those judgments about people we see online. How much of you is showing?

Looking at Them?,” Annals of Psychology, August 5, 2002, viewed on Gladwell.com.

online correspondence provide clues about you. However, given the nature of 
this type of messaging—one-to-one and often fleeting—it is not usually worth 
scouring the Internet to find and retrieve these electronic breadcrumbs. Much of 
this information, like text messages or many online chats, is not saved. Nearly all 
your correspondence is intended for a single person, and that person will either 
delete it or save it, but probably never share it, so it is highly unlikely to sneak 
into your public Internet persona.
If your friends post your e-mails or text messages online or if your messages 
are mostly posted in public on others’ walls in social media spaces, then you 
should take these into account when you review what you have posted online.
Keep in mind that the person who receives your correspondence may not be 
the only reader or the only one who decides what is saved and what is sent into 
oblivion. E-mails sent to a business address may be held on a company’s server 
for years, and today nearly every company has reserved for itself the legal right 
to review their employees’ e-mail. If a business is sued, it may be required to save 
all e-mail entering or leaving its server and turn the e-mail over to lawyers for 
review. Some families use computer control software that allows one computer 
in the home network to see all correspondence that passes through the network, 
even e-mail or text that seems to have been deleted.
Gmail from Google uses computer algorithms to analyze the text of mes-
sages sent from or into its service. The company likely attaches the information 
about you to their sophisticated marketing profile of you, and more immediately, 
provides advertisements on your e-mail page that are influenced by what Google 
thinks you are talking about in your messages. So even if your electronic message 
is written to one person and that person deletes it from his or her inbox immedi-
ately upon reading it, someone else may know what was in the message, and your 
message may become part of what people know about you through the Internet.
Delving into Databases
A good exploration of your online persona should include digging deeper into 
the database sites that relate to your life. These include your school data, your 
city’s history, religious information, and data about your early work life. Skipping 
across the top of the World Wide Web can take you only so far. People research-
ing your life will dig deeper. Many public databases and informational websites are 
used as a starting point by professional investigators trying to learn about a target.
Hiding Behind a Torn Screen: Flaws 
in Internet Anonymity
People sometimes use pseudonyms or “handles” to identify themselves in com-
ments at interactive sites, whereas others sign up for dating sites or social sites

such as Myspace or Xanga using false names or nicknames like “lonelygirl16,” 
“evilclown,” or “dogsrool.” When you follow the trails that you have left online, 
assume that, whatever name you’ve used, a researcher can trace each comment, 
photo, or item of personal information back to you.
Using a false name online can shield you from being exposed as the person 
who always makes nasty comments about cat lovers or the woman looking for 
love in Phoenix. However, you can’t be certain that a false name will protect 
your identity. There are many ways that your true identity could be discovered.
Tech Tools to Help Find You
There are Internet tools that others can use to break through your barrier of 
false names and find the many facets of your Internet presence.
Social media companies may not know your real name, but before you can 
comment or add information to the running discussions online, you must set 
up an account using your e-mail address. The research site called Spokeo allows 
reverse lookup of your e-mail address. Using reverse lookup, anyone can iden-
tify your “handle” on social media sites. Spokeo scours the Web for social sites 
connected to your e-mail address and displays comments, pictures, videos, and 
preferences in user accounts connected to your e-mail address, plus the “handle” 
that you used to enter this information.
Other tools that you’ll find at sites such as emailFinder.com or Lookup 
emailaddresses.com perform similar functions. New tools are added to the Inter-
net all the time, and people can use them to discover your online pseudonyms 
and tie your real name to the comments you have been leaving online. These are 
also great tools for you to use to build a profile of your online presence.
But Spokeo is not the only tool to unmask Internet users who thought that 
they were anonymous. Forbes magazine describes an entire class of online mar-
keting companies that charge retailers to track down the identities of anonymous 
website visitors. Companies such as Relead, Visual Visitor, and Loopfuse charge 
for the service of generating more targeted leads by better identifying the people 
who visit a website.8 And remember that Google and other search firms are 
keeping vast amounts of information about you and may be able to provide that 
data to retailers on request. Marketers are tracking your movements online, and if 
some of those movements involve a registered site used under an assumed name, 
then your assumed name just becomes one more point of data in your retail file.
Even the FBI is finding new and creative ways to find people who believe 
they are anonymous in their use of the Internet. One of the methods of care-
fully protecting against exposure of your identity online is to use it through 
specialized free software and an open network like the one called Tor, that 
protects against all kinds of traffic analysis software. Wired magazine reported 
that the U.S. FBI has adopted a well-known hacker’s tool called Metasploit and 
www.ebook3000.com

97
its “Decloaking Engine” to “stage its first known effort to successfully identify a 
multitude of suspects hiding behind the Tor anonymity network.”9 Metasploit 
is described by Wired as “the most important tool in the hacking world: An 
open-source Swiss Army knife of hacks that puts the latest exploits in the 
hands of anyone who’s interested.”10 As we might expect, law enforcement is 
using available tools to track down suspects, but these tools are available to 
others too.
And always remember that lawyers in the midst of litigation have important 
tools at their disposal. (See the It’s Legal box that follows.) A subpoena served to 
your Internet service provider (ISP) can yield important information about who 
you are and where online you have been. Most ISPs will not give up information 
about you without some type of legal process document, like a subpoena or a 
court order. Learning your IP address, the numbered address of any website you 
are controlling, can lead to a lookup of your name and contact information on 
the “Whois” tool available to anyone. So there are a number of tools for someone 
who really wants to hunt you down and break through even the most carefully 
planned online anonymity.
Learning about Yourself Using Search Engines
The World Wide Web contains billions of pages of information that are 
publicly available to anyone with an Internet connection and a browser. Millions 
of pages are added every day, which could make it challenging to find any needle 
in this enormous haystack.
To keep all these data discoverable, as information flows onto the public 
Web, much of it is captured and cataloged by search engines. All day and night, 
search companies send out “spider” programs, crawling and cataloging the 
Web. The spiders find new sites and note the changes to existing sites. With 
this huge database of Web information, search companies then apply software 
that finds links and connections between and among various points on the Net, 
determining popularity and interest levels, eventually ranking Web locations on 
various different criteria. When a query is typed, the Internet search company 
uses complicated calculations to guess what each searcher wishes to find on the 
Internet from the search terms entered and then to propose likely targets of each 
search. That makes search engines handy tools you can use to your advantage in 
discovering your online persona.
Looking for You
Internet searches are not limited to finding e-commerce or informational 
sites. You can search for yourself to see how many sites contain a mention of 
your name and whether pictures or videos display your unique charms on the 
Web.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
98
Searching for your name on Google, Yahoo!, or Bing is known as an “ego 
search” because many people do it just to stroke their own ego by finding out 
who is talking about them and measuring their popularity or success by the size 
of their Internet footprints. This seems to be the modern-day equivalent of 
looking to see if you are mentioned in the local newspaper’s society page.
But searching for your name on the Internet is also an important step in 
discovering and managing your online persona. You need to see the depth and 
character of information about you and what other people can find out about 
you online to know if the information is accurate and to repair any serious image 
problems.
I t ’ s  L e g a l
When anonymous speech crosses a legal line into defamation or unfair 
business practices, the legal system of the United States provides a way 
to uncover the identity of the speaker. The victim of the unlawful speech 
can petition a court to subpoena records that display the identity of the 
speaker. How does this work? Every person enters the Internet from some 
device. Your home desktop computer, your laptop from work, or your 
mobile smartphone all rely on an Internet provider to access the Web. Each 
Internet provider has a specific numerical identifier that pinpoints Internet 
traffic originating from their service. It’s likely that your provider has also 
assigned your computer or smartphone a number so that all of your Web 
surfing, comments, uploads, and downloads can be traced directly to your 
device. Although there is software that can mask this process, it’s not always 
perfect, and the majority of Internet users don’t use technology tools to stay 
anonymous. Most of us rely on using a different name for various accounts, 
never realizing that such behavior will not affect how comments can be 
traced through Internet protocols.
In normal circumstances, companies, individuals, or governments will 
not have access to the information that traces your comments back to your 
Internet account. But someone who convinces a court to issue a subpoena 
or a valid court order is likely to gain access to the data, assuming that the 
relevant websites and Internet providers have kept the information on file. 
The anonymity of standard Internet users is no match for the legal system. 
This is an important way that your identity may be compromised online.

Keep in mind these tips for constructive searches:
•  Use quotation marks around your name. If you search your name with-
out enclosing it in quotation marks, the search engine may provide 
early results that not only identify you, but it will also uncover sites that 
use either your first or last name, finding other people, places, or things 
that share your first name or last name. The quotation marks instruct 
the search engine that you are only interested in matching all the words 
listed in the order in which you typed them.
•  Seek out all major variations of your name. If you are a married 
woman, Web information about you may be listed under your married 
name and under your maiden name, so check both. If your name is 
spelled differently in English or is often written with the appropriate 
accent marks, then search for both versions. Remember that millions 
of websites are written in English, but millions are likely to exist in 
your home language as well.
•  Check the formal version of your name and any nicknames that peo-
ple might use to identify you. The background check for “Fast Eddie 
Labeque” is likely to unearth a different type of Web reference than 
the search for “Edward Labeque,” “J. Edward Labeque,” or “Jackson 
Edward Labeque.” Try all variations for the broadest possible results.
•  Include all titles or honorary terms that might apply to your name, 
such as “Dr. Edward Labeque” or “Edward Labeque Jr.” The purpose 
of this exercise is to discover as many references to yourself as possible 
on the Internet so that you can see an accurate picture of your online 
persona.
•  Search with important words from your life in addition to your 
name. The search for “Tracey Smith” is likely to produce scores of 
pages on various people named Tracey Smith. Sorting among the 
mass of irrelevant Web pages is time-consuming and frustrating. 
Break through the clutter by including the city you live in, your 
workplace, or spouse’s name in your search. These modifiers are more 
likely to pull information about you to the forefront. In other words, 
once you have found everything possible for “Edward Labeque,” 
search the Web by attaching “Galveston” or “teacher” to the name, or 
search “Edward and Catherine Labeque.” Frequently, this will pull 
targeted sites up toward the top of the search pages and make them 
easier to find.
•  Include words that highlight the reason you might have been featured 
on a Web page. Look for articles that address your sporting victories 
by adding the words tennis, rugby, or skiing to your name as appropri-

Protecting Your Internet Identity
100
ate. If you sell real estate, try searching with the word realtor next to 
your name.
•  Use several different search engines, and use their various tools for a 
broader range of results. When using Google, first try the traditional 
Web search to find any sites that mention your name. Then proceed 
to the Google Images search, a Google video search, and YouTube 
videos search to see what media content is posted about you. If you 
are an academic and want to find your work, Google has a special 
search engine precisely for this purpose. Use it to search both your 
name and your publication topics. If you are a journalist seeking your 
work, also try the name of the publication you work for, and search 
in Google News.
•  Keep in mind that images captured by search engines are not always 
pictures of you but may be pictures of people who are related to you 
personally or professionally. Images may include books you have 
written or products that you have endorsed. For example, Google 
Research captures articles that may have been written by you or 
about you. We are always surprised at how often our names appear in 
Google Blogs, capturing forgotten interviews and articles, despite the 
fact that neither of us has a blog of our own.
•  Review as many search engine results pages as possible. The item you 
want may be on page 16 or page 2 of the results, so you may have to 
scroll through lots of pages. And you never know when an apparently 
obscure picture noted on the tenth page of a Google search will gain 
popularity and move up to the first page. Sometimes this happens 
because the reference itself receives links or hits from other sites. Often 
results move in rankings because the site containing your picture or the 
content around your picture moves in the rankings for no reason related 
to you. Either way, it is best to run a broad and deep search to learn as 
much as possible about your online persona.
Search engines are not infallible, and they cannot read your mind. Even 
the most sophisticated search tools only recognize the precise phrases you type 
in the search box, often influenced by the types of searches you have run previ-
ously on the same computer. So experiment with terms and learn about how 
to broaden or narrow your searches. Start broad and narrow as necessary to 
weed out unwanted data. Starting with a broader search allows you to see if any 
information exists on your topic, rather than to try to capture everything online 
about your topic in a series of narrower searches. Reducing scope as you proceed 
can facilitate your inquiry into a variety of related topics: “Edward Labeque 
dentist,” “Edward Labeque scrabble,” “Edward Labeque charity,” and “Edward

Labeque grand theft auto” are all searches that will bring out varying aspects of 
Dr. Labeque’s life.
Search engines are only as useful as the information they return, which is 
driven by the search algorithm the company uses and the number and types 
of sites searched. All search engines have significant limitations. The Google 
engine prioritizes information based on the concept that the more sites link to 
this information, the more important it must be. This premise has led to many 
fruitful searches, but it may not find all significant references to you online.
Google’s site notes that you are looking for answers, not trillions of Web 
pages, so the Google algorithms are designed to provide the answers you are 
most likely looking for. Google states that “Today Google’s algorithms rely 
on more than 200 unique signals or ‘clues’ that make it possible to guess what 
you might really be looking for. These signals include things like the terms on 
websites, the freshness of content, your region and PageRank.”11 For this rea-
son, Google will guess that you are seeking the “China Dynasty” restaurant in 
the town you are living in, rather than a restaurant in a different town. And the 
evolving Google presentation screen will provide you with the phone number, 
menu, Web site, operating hours, and location of that local restaurant because 
studies show that these are the facts you are most likely to be seeking by initiat-
ing your search.
Google searches information listed on public sites posted on the World 
Wide Web. Much information about individuals is listed in databases that may 
be accessed through the Internet but will not turn up in a standard Google 
search. Using other search engines or search tools like Google Research or the

The challenge of searching for yourself can be more difficult if you share a 
name with a celebrity. A Time article about Internet name searches noted 
that if your name is Brian Jones and you’re not the former Rolling Stones 
guitarist, then you don’t exist on the Internet. Of course, the problem has 
nothing to do with your existence and everything to do with the extensive 
publicity given to celebrities online. Fortunately, major search engines pro-
vide a way for you to exclude certain terms from your searches. You’re much 
more likely to find the Brian Jones you seek if you type the following phrase 
into the search bar: “Brian Jones”-“rolling stones”-guitar

Yahoo! Directory may help but may still leave online information about you 
undiscovered. Search engines are helpful and will find information that you 
otherwise would never have known about, but they are not a panacea for finding 
all references to you. This is why we shouldn’t stop with searching for people 
using major online tools. You are likely to find information in many more places.
Analyzing Your Profile
As you search for yourself online, highlight or save links to Web sites that con-
tain information about you (a tool such as Microsoft OneNote can be a great 
way to catalog these links). You can also copy the URLs (Web addresses) to a 
Word document or write URLs down on a sheet of paper.
Once you have pulled together all the information about yourself that you 
can find online, it’s time to examine the results. Taken as a whole, your online 
persona is likely to show a distorted image of who you are, leaving out important 
aspects of your life. You should think about whether this view of you is telling 
the world too much or too little. Should it be pared back so there is less data 
online about you, or should it be supplemented so that people will have a more 
accurate picture of you?
Start with an overview of your entire collection of data. If someone was able 
to find all of the information you just uncovered, what would he know about 
you? What impression would he have of your personality, your life, and your

There is a set of data aggregators that collects information both online and 
in the physical world to sell to investigators, employers, curious mothers-in-
law, and anyone else who may want to learn about you.
One site that offers a uniquely Internet-centric set of information is 
Spokeo. Started by Stanford students as a way to aggregate their friends’ so-
cial network postings, Spokeo evolved into something much more insidious. 
Spokeo searches dozens of picture, video, music, and social sites and finds 
all information tied to a single e-mail address. This means that anyone who 
has received an e-mail from you, or who knows your e-mail address, can find 
many of the accounts that you opened using the e-mail address. Even if you 
think your Twitter feed, your Instagram account, your dating profile, your

habits? Would he or she know where to find you on a given day and what to 
say to you so that you would like and trust him or her? Think about the types of 
people who might be looking at your online persona. Would a nosey neighbor 
find out things that you wouldn’t want him or her to know? Would a prospective 
political blog, or your Shutterfly picture albums are anonymous, a Spokeo 
user who has your e-mail address will be able to easily tell that you are the 
name behind the account.
Spokeo calls this type of search a “reverse e-mail lookup.” When you enter 
a person’s e-mail address in the tool, Spokeo provides you with a summary 
that may include the name and probably the address of the person attached 
to that e-mail address. If you are a paid member of Spokeo, you could see 
the various online profiles of that person; the person’s participation in social 
networking, dating, music, video, and online shopping sites; all information 
that Spokeo can find on the person’s family; data on the person’s house, 
including photographs and neighborhood evaluations; wealth and income 
data; lifestyle and personal interests; and authentication that reveals whether 
the e-mail is actively in use. Looking up a person by name or phone number 
can also provide political affiliation, race, highest level of education, religion, 
and reading material.
Spokeo uses a search tool that works differently from those offered by 
other search engines and data aggregation sites. The Spokeo website states:
Spokeo can help you learn about people who have shaped our world by provid-
ing one of the largest libraries of online famous people profiles. Browse photos 
and videos and timelines, including the public whereabouts of your favorite 
stars. Research a new neighborhood before you move through Spokeo’s reverse 
address search or lookup any people who will be in close contact with you and 
your family.
Spokeo claims to harvest information from phone directories, government 
databases, social networks, mailing lists, and business information sites. Al-
though all of this information may be publicly available, it’s much easier to 
pull together in one place using a tool such as Spokeo.
Joining a data aggregation site like Spokeo will shortcut your search for 
online information about yourself. These sites pull together full profiles 
based on deep digging for public data and save you clicking through dozens 
of sites to find your online profile. Many of these sites show financial and 
property information. Spokeo, in fact, searches and displays a total of nine 
categories of social networking sites.

employer or serious boyfriend or girlfriend find information that paints you in a 
bad light or that would hurt your future prospects? Would a potential robber or 
identity thief find enough data to pretend he or she was you at the bank or to 
convince you of a scam?
Consider conducting an exercise in persona analysis. After you’ve reviewed 
all the information you collected about your online persona, construct a full 
picture of the character described there. Based only on the online data, who is 
this person, and what are his or her priorities in life? Do you like him or her? 
Could you track him or her down in real life using only the information you col-
lected online? Fill a page or two with descriptions and analysis of the person you 
have just researched. Include a paragraph of missing items—important current 
or historical personal facts that you could not find online. Using this detailed 
analysis, you’re ready to decide which items should remain online, which should 
be removed, and what should be added to present the identity you want to own.
Revealing Yourself Online: A Checklist
Building a full profile of your online image helps you control what everyone else 
sees when they search for you. The following checklist should help you complete 
this task.
•  Check the trail you have blazed on the Internet: Social media profiles, 
online journals, dating sites, photo collections, and video sites
•  Location-based sites (like Foursquare) 
•  Music sites
•  Do these sites allow you to limit access (friends only)?
•  Have you signed up using a fake name?
•  Have your friends and family posted information about you?
•  What presence have you left for others to see? Shopping sites, mer-
chant sales (do you sell products on eBay or other sites?), preferences 
(publicly displayed likes, dislikes, and comments), and correspondence 
exposed to everyone?
•  Is there information revealed by search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo!, 
and Ask.com. How many pages of results did you find for each search? 
Have you used specialized searches such as for images or video? Have 
you run a deeper search on sites such as Spokeo?
•  What information is available on third-party databases, in newspa-
pers, and other media?
•  Have you checked government agencies such as courts for records?
•  What other sites could hold and display information about you, 
for example history or genealogy sites?

While it may be frustrating or depressing to find embarrassing information 
about yourself online, you are better off knowing what your online image is. As 
you will see in the next chapter, there are several strategies available to you for 
removing or obscuring content from sites on the Internet. Knowing the extent 
of the damage is the crucial first step to understanding how to fix it.

N
ow that you have researched and analyzed your online persona, it’s time 
to repair any damage to your reputation on the Internet and create a 
new, better online image. Part of this exercise is reactive—cleaning up 
the problems that you discovered and limiting access to those places that should 
be kept private. Part of the exercise is proactive—building and creating a pres-
ence on sites that people will use to judge your character.
This chapter describes the tools you can use and actions you can take to 
manage your Internet persona. We examine broad strategies for adjusting your 
image, including the care and cleaning of your online profiles and sites. We tell 
you how to remove old or embarrassing content from the sites of friends and 
family. We also explain what’s involved in getting information taken down from 
business and government sites. In addition, you get an overview of various legal 
remedies that may help cleanse your Internet persona and of the limitations of 
these remedies.
Choosing Change
Have you ever driven down the highway and thought about what each vehicle 
says about its driver? Whether you drive a flashy sports car or a pickup truck you 
choose to project a certain image, just as you do when making choices about 
what to post online. It’s time to go car shopping, and choose the exact online 
image you want to display.
Before we dive into remedies, we want to encourage you to give some 
thought to the new online you. This time around, you should gain control of 
what information goes out there, putting yourself forward in a positive way and 
incorporating new information that shows you in the best possible light.
You must first decide what you want your image to be. If your life is chang-
ing drastically—for example, if you are graduating from school and entering 
the workforce—it is likely that your more youthful online persona along with 
childish resentments and pranks should change to reflect what you want others

to see. If you move to a new city for a fresh start, why should you drag your old 
habits and friends along with you? If you are about to be married, maybe it’s time 
to remove all those dating site accounts. Changes such as moving to a different 
town, expanding your family, taking a new job, all shift your life in ways that 
should be reflected in your online persona.
One of the authors of this book attended a wedding reception where the 
siblings of the bride and groom read out loud to the guests the online dating 
advertisements that attracted the happy couple to each other in the first place. 
This “reading of the eHarmony profiles” ceremony made clear the changing 
personas of the bride and groom from “single and looking” to “committed and 
happy.” Many characteristics of your old life can remain online long after you 
have outgrown your connection with them. Clearing out these obsolete sign-
posts is an important step in establishing that you are committed and happy with 
the changes in your life.
Human growth entails recognizing each new age and building on the past, 
and the Internet can help us grow. Even if you want to advertise your current 
life and preferences to everyone, you will probably want to update your adver-
tisements on a regular basis. No one wants to be judged on old data, and no one 
wants to be thought of as the person she used to be.
Setting Goals
If you’ve realized that, for whatever reason, it’s time to make a change, it’s 
a good idea to first set some goals. First, consider the size of your presence 
online: your Internet footprint. Knowing whether you want a broader, deeper 
Internet persona or a more cultivated and curated, pared-back version will 
help you to set priorities and make decisions as you build your new Internet 
identity. So many choices now exist to help you project your online image that 
your first selection between blossoming and pruning will provide an initial 
direction.
Perhaps your goal is to minimize your online footprint. You may want to 
strip back how much people can see about you online, closing down accounts 
and making others available to “friends only.” Are you embarrassed by the 
pictures and comments on your Facebook or Instagram page? Then limit the 
number of people who can see them, and keep them hidden from employers and 
future dates. Have you moved past an old relationship, an old career, or an old 
haircut? Then pull those aspects of your former life down from the Web entirely. 
Clipping your Internet presence doesn’t have to lead to a tiny Web presence. It 
can be the start of a process to build your Internet persona, this time from the 
solid base of carefully selected content. With this approach you can keep a low 
profile on the Internet, or you can use your new smaller presence as a foundation 
for building your new Internet persona.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
108
Alternatively, you may want to keep your Internet presence as it is with few 
changes but manage it more effectively. Maybe you like the information you find 
when you Google yourself, and it serves as a terrific starting point for a more 
self-directed footprint. Or maybe you find your Internet presence to be perfect 
right now. If you like what you see, your job is to simply keep your image current 
and clip the weeds back every now and then.
You might decide to maximize your online footprint, diving into social 
sites such as Facebook, Buzznet, LinkedIn, and Twitter to help you network 
for that next job or relationship. You might flood the Web with your opinions, 
ideas, and activities, creating an expanding and complicated online persona that 
replaces your older image with new energy. You might dive deeply into every 
website you can find that supports or comments on your favorite topic—Eigh-
teenth Century British poetry, consumer privacy, Warner Brothers cartoons, 
stock prices of the Fortune 500—and demonstrate your interest and expertise 
within a community narrow in scope, but broad in geography.
There are as many Web persona strategies as there are human personalities 
and experience. Whatever strategy you choose, at least you will become aware 
of what people can find out about you online and you will have taken steps to 
manage your image so that it reflects your current priorities.
It’s a Lifestyle
Your Internet persona is a living, growing thing that can sprout new roots 
and branches before your eyes, even if you do nothing. The search you perform 
in six months will probably turn up different items than the one you perform 
right now, and the growth in your image captured by the Internet may not be 
the growth you want people to see. So occasional and relentless online hygiene 
is an important aspect to protecting your reputation.
Rethinking and amending your online image is an exercise that you may 
want to consider repeating regularly. Like spring cleaning or replanting a gar-
den, you can set aside time once a year to analyze the ways that your image has 
changed on the Internet, pruning the unsightly growth and adding some fresh, 
new data to reflect any changes in your life.
Remember that technology, social trends, and the information others post 
about you will constantly change and you’ll need to monitor how this change 
affects you. Think about the fact that a social media site like Facebook didn’t 
even exist until 2003, and didn’t gain widespread popularity until much later. 
Entire worlds have grown online in that time, and it is likely that new worlds 
will emerge and expand over the next several years. The Internet continues to 
grow as millions of people add more information on current sites and more types 
of new sites come along. Some of that information will describe you or highlight 
aspects of your behavior or your personality.

Your online persona is here to stay, and the care and maintenance of this 
image should be as automatic and routine as updating your résumé when you 
go on a job interview or checking yourself in the mirror before you head out on 
a date.
Keeping Your Private Life Private
Before the Internet our lives were much more private. We had to make an effort 
to expose our lives to public view and scrutiny. If you wanted a broad group of 
people to know about your exploits, you would have to have found a reporter so 
you might be seen in the newspaper, heard on the radio, or both seen and heard 
on television. 
Now, in the age of social media and behavioral information collecting, our 
lives are public, and we have to make an effort to keep them private. Pictures of 
you may be published by many people and seen by hundreds, thousands, or if 
you go viral, millions. 
In this age some people accept having their entire lives viewed by others. 
But many of us believe that every last thought, opinion, picture, and connection 
should not be available for viewing online. Many believe that only they and those

For an expert perspective on cleansing your online persona, we talked to 
professional reputation consultant Henry Fawell, president of Campfire 
Communications, a strategic communications firm in Baltimore, Maryland. 
Henry advised, 
Your online reputation matters. It’s not static. It’s a handshake. It allows 
customers, journalists, employers and investors to size you up, look you 
in the digital eye, and make judgments about your character without ever 
meeting you. The question is not whether those judgments will be made; 
the question is whether you will actively seek to influence them. We need 
to treat our online reputations like our property. When our lawn gets 
overgrown, we mow it. When the pigeons do injustice to our car, we wash 
it. When our suit gets wrinkled, we dry clean it. Why would we treat our 
reputations any differently?

they trust should have access to our lives, relationships, and information. Luck-
ily, there are several things you can do to protect your privacy.
Think before You Post
The first step toward greater privacy is to filter the information you expose 
about yourself. The less you say about your life, your family, and your activities 
in a public forum, the more privacy you will have.
E v e n  S p i e s  H a v e  P e r s o n a s
Some people are actually put at physical risk by public exposure. British 
government official Sir John Sawers was selected in 2010 to be the leader of 
the British Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6. Before he could take 
that office, the press noticed that his wife, Lady Shelley Sawers, maintained 
a Facebook page full of pictures and intimate details about her family. As 
stated by one press site, “This means that information such as the names, 
photos, and whereabouts of the couple’s children, the apartment the couple 
lives in, the identities of their parents and close friends, where they spend 
their holidays and much more, was widely available to over 200 million 
people.”*
Lady Sawers’s Facebook page included all types of family pictures and 
information that linked the couple to controversial political figures and 
famous actors. The Daily Mail wrote, “Over the past year, Lady Sawers has 
been regularly updating anyone who cared to read her page—which could 
be found via Internet search engines—on everything from family parties 
and holidays to the health of their pets and her views on the crisis in the 
Congo.”† Once discovered by the press, and questioned for the poor judg-
ment of posting family pictures and family locations for the nation’s top 
spymaster, the Sawers family removed the Facebook page and have cleansed 
their information from social media sites.
You probably aren’t a spy, but you should still take steps to keep certain 
information about your private life private.

Although this seems like a commonsense strategy, it requires some disci-
pline to shift our thinking from posting anything we like to being more selec-
tive. Many people do not stop to think about the potential costs of stating 
their political or religious beliefs for everyone to see. We all feel our beliefs are 
sound, and we may not consider how offending someone who holds different 
beliefs may harm our chances for a new job or damage us in our personal lives. 
A potential new employer may feel that oversharing shows poor judgment. We 
may encourage diversity of opinion and lifestyle in our clubs, schools, and work-
places, but flaunting your beliefs and opinions can be counterproductive when 
those online statements are one of the few things about us that our new boss or 
teacher can discover.
Similarly, most people don’t see the harm in posting pictures of how they 
spend their leisure time—for example, on a beach vacation or at a party, expos-
ing more of their bodies and their lifestyles than other people might be comfort-
able seeing. If you wouldn’t wear a Speedo swimsuit or a bikini to the office, 
why would you want all of your coworkers to see you in such a state of undress 
with the click of a mouse? Drinking a glass of wine with dinner is acceptable in 
our culture, but if all of your social media pictures involve alcohol, then someone 
just learning about you might believe that alcohol is a driving force in your life. 
Cultivating a professional image takes care and attention. An unattended online 
persona can undercut all the work you invested to appear professional to your 
colleagues.
New tools such as Foursquare, Yik Yak, and Shout allow you to share your 
physical location so that anyone can see how much time you spend at bars or 
casinos, with your boyfriend, camping with friends, waiting in line at a club, or 
far away from home. You may believe that sharing such information with the 
important people in your life can make your existence safer, more connected, 
and more interesting. However, sharing these data with everyone may be irre-
sponsible, not only in encouraging crimes against you but also in leaking details 
about your private life that could affect your career or your future relationships.
Just because you can post information does not mean that you should post 
it. Posting online is an act of publication, similar to submitting a press release 
or picture to your local paper. Before you release a picture, opinion, location, or 
other information, you should ask yourself who might be able to see it and what 
that person might do with the information.
Imagine Your Audience . . . Smaller
A basic feature of all the major social media platforms is that you can control 
how many people see your information by adjusting the privacy settings on your 
page. Begin addressing your existing Internet persona by tightening the viewing 
circle on all of your social media sites. Whether you have an online diary, shared 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
112
picture stream, or a standard identity page for business or pleasure, make active 
decisions about who can view your posted and uploaded material. Certain infor-
mation should be for “friends only,” although it’s okay to leave other content 
open to the world. Try to make a conscious decision about which information is 
protected and which is made public.
As social networking sites mature, their administrative and privacy settings 
grow more sophisticated. At one point in the history of Facebook, a user only 
had the choice of making his or her entire profile public or making the entire 
profile viewable only by people marked as “friends.” Now the administrators of 
Facebook allow a rich set of privacy options. Website owners provide these set-
tings for your safety and convenience, so use them.
As of this writing, Facebook breaks your profile and onsite activities down 
into nine categories, including “your status, photos, and posts” and the geolo-
cation application of “the places you check into.” You can determine whether 
everyone who visits Facebook can see any of this information, only your friends 
can see it, or if it is available to a broader, but still limited, group called “friends 
of friends.” This means that you can allow everyone to see your biography and 
favorite quotations, while keeping, for example, your religion and your direct 
contact information restricted to a closer circle of friends. To make these selec-
tions, go to the “Account” tab at the top right of your Facebook page, click the 
Privacy Settings tab, and customize your access settings.
Other social sites such as Google+, LinkedIn, and Tumblr also offer dif-
ferent privacy options that allow you to select which information is shared with 
various groups of site users. Some of these settings let premium paid users see 
more about you. LinkedIn, for example, allows paid users of its site to find out 
more information about all of its profiled users than you could see with a free 
profile and membership. Paid users get to see expanded profiles of everyone 
on LinkedIn and are allowed to “get the real story on anyone with Reference 
Search.” Instagram offers a selection of frequently asked questions to help mem-
bers decide how to use privacy features and to demonstrate ways of limiting 
access to a user’s account.
Cleaning House
Do you hoard knickknacks and papers in your house? Maybe you’re an 
online hoarder as well. You have to analyze what is already posted online and 
carefully clean out and remove all the unnecessary clutter.
One of the advantages of the Internet over older forms of media is that the 
Internet allows real-time input on any aspect of life. Many of our comments 
online are significant, if at all, only to the news of the moment, with no lasting 
relevance for our lives or the rest of the world. Telling your friend that her new 
haircut is lovely, telling your poker buddies that you will be late to the game this

week, and telling the world that you are grieving for victims of a flood or earth-
quake—all of these statements quickly become clutter after their useful time has 
passed. You have no reason for keeping them as part of your online persona days, 
months, or years later. Dump them.
H i g h l i g h t e d  T o o l :  X - p i r e !
Humiliating pictures seem to last forever on the Internet. Funny at first, the 
photo of you with the tomato sauce on your cheek or with the completely 
demented look on your face loses its appeal quickly but may remain for years 
online, haunting and marring your online persona. With this problem in 
mind, a group of German researchers created a software service called X-pire!
By using a free app download, a user of Facebook or Flickr can set an 
encrypted timer on his or her online picture that stops displaying the pho-
tograph after a predetermined expiration date. By using this tool, you can 
allow all your friends to see the photos of the bacchanalian New Year’s Eve 
party but set those pictures to expire, dropping offline after two weeks so 
that you and other partygoers won’t be embarrassed by them in the future.
The service creates sophisticated encryption technology to limit viewing 
of a photograph, and the X-pire! developers are working on making the 
service easy to operate for the average social media user. The founder of 
X-pire!, Michael Backes, has said, “The software is not designed for people 
who understand how to protect their data but rather for the huge mass of 
people who want to solve the problem at its core and not to have to think 
about it anymore.”*
X-pire! is an app that works on both the Apple and Android mobile 
platforms. Also, although a picture marked to expire by X-pire! software 
cannot be viewed online after expiration, Internet users who know the pic-
ture’s location could still download the picture and view it once it’s saved on 
a hard drive. So this tool is not yet a panacea for people hoping to hide all 
their photographs over time.
However, the existence of X-pire! shows that researchers and compa-
nies are paying attention to the problem of long-term Internet exposure 
of personal photographs. Since the first publishing of this book, X-pire! 
broadened its abilities to automatically take down online information before 
it becomes stale or outlives its usefulness.

Remember that information online is virtually permanent, and older 
information can give a stale and imprecise impression of your current life. 
Think of the Internet as a huge closet of data that you have to clean out now 
and then.
Take the time to analyze, delete, and archive older information, so that only 
the freshest data about you are available online. There are tools that automate 
this process, from Privacy Protector, which sweeps and manages your browser 
lists erasing your Internet browsing history, to X-pire!, a service that makes cer-
tain information and pictures fall off of the Web after a set period of time. You 
can moderate comments on your Flickr photo albums and videos with the Flickr 
Cleaner tool, and you can strip your online comments of links and HTML tags 
with the Comments Cleaner browser plug-in. TweetDelete allows a Twitter 
user to eliminate posts that are more than a month or two old. Just set the type 
of tweets to be deleted and the time frame for expiration, and you are ready to 
show the world a cleaner Twitter account. Learning how to use these tools can 
help you to keep your online persona clean and up-to-date without a significant 
time commitment.
Managing Friends
Remember, no man is an island; your friends and family are out there post-
ing information about you, too. Try to clean your old information off friend’s 
pages as often as you wipe it off your own. This isn’t always an easy task because 
you first have to get your friends to understand all that you’ve learned from this 
book and why you and they should be concerned. Your friends and family may 
resist your requests or may not get around to taking down information immedi-
ately, so be relentless and educate them about the importance of a clean Internet 
persona. Tell your friends that you are undertaking a systematic clean-up of your 
online image and that you will help them scrub content off your pages when they 
decide to police their own images.
First, examine all of the pictures tagging you, the comments discussing your 
great test score or insight in the book club, and the shout-outs to you on the sites 
of others. Next, decide which items are worth the hassle of a take-down request. 
Prioritize pictures or comments that are particularly embarrassing or that will be 
noted negatively by your future mother-in-law or by the human resources direc-
tor when you are looking for a new job. Think about how you want your online 
persona to appear and request that friends and family members remove those 
items that don’t match the image you want to portray.

the Internet is your ability to participate as yourself, or as VikinginDuluth, or as 
a third-level magic elf in a multiplayer role-playing game. You can keep a per-
sonal account for your friends and a business account for your clients. By taking 
reasonable care to keep them separated, your business contacts will likely not be 
able to track you to your friends, or vice versa.
It is important to remember that if you are one of the people who wants to 
keep online identities separate, you should create a new e-mail address for all 
sites and accounts for which you want to maintain anonymity. Using a single 
e-mail address to support your business at BobtheAccountant and your secret 
account at studmuffin4U is a dangerous proposition. Many Web investigation 
tools, including the social media search tool Spokeo (see chapter 4), can trace 
dozens of accounts that are all tied to the same e-mail address.
Because Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!, and others will provide you with one or 
more e-mail addresses for free, it’s not expensive to ensure that each persona 
that you want to keep separate from the others is registered using a unique 
e-mail address; do not cross-list the addresses for online accounts. Keep Julie 
Lee separated from luvgrl93 before your worlds collide, to the embarrassment 
of everybody.
Removing Information from Third-Party Sites
Some of your worst exposures could be on the sites of the business you work 
for (think of last year’s holiday party) or the organizations that you belong to 
(remember the summer pool party that your neighborhood association threw 
this summer?). Organizations are usually responsive to take-down requests, but 
these often must go through a vetting process and often take time. 
You could also have been caught by a camera by a news reporter or party 
site. These pictures or posts are much harder to get removed.
Certain online data are under your direct control. However, much of the 
information that encompasses your Internet persona is within the control of 
companies, governments, and other people. In the previous section of this chap-
ter, we discussed how you deal with asking friends and family to remove infor-
mation from their sites; now it’s time to examine how to approach companies or 
people that you don’t know and ask them to delete your data.
Certain information will not be removed no matter how forcefully you 
demand it. Your county keeps records on real estate transfers and records nam-
ing the people who spoke at commission meetings, for example. It’s not within 
the discretion of the county’s webmaster to remove this information. Similarly, 
public corporations have filing requirements that may contain information about 
your stock ownership or other formal relationships with the company, and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission may also post stock purchase records on

its website. These entities will continue to display those documents as long as 
you continue the relationship.
If you’ve been mentioned in a news story, the article or video will probably 
be placed in searchable archives. Even if you prefer that the world forget your 
first three marriages, the wedding announcements in those archives could keep 
them alive forever on the newspaper’s website.
Other sites make a living off posted content, so they would not be likely to 
drop a picture from the site based on your request. If you find a risqué picture 
of your daughter in a swimsuit or a video of you entering an adult bookstore, 
a number of Internet sites would never be responsive to requests for removal 
because their revenue is based on finding and publishing photos and videos that 
titillate people or tattle on them. In some cases, the sites are poorly managed or 
simply unresponsive. With no incentive to take the time for removing the con-
tent you don’t like, they will not make the effort, and you are unlikely to have 
leverage to force them to do so.
With limited exceptions, U.S. law does not provide a remedy for you to 
force a website owner to remove a picture of you from its site, as long as that 
picture was accurate and taken in public, no matter how embarrassing the pic-
ture may be. Many sites will honor your request to remove content featuring you, 
and making yourself a nuisance can often sway the webmaster’s thinking, but 
threatening lawsuits may be counterproductive. You are more likely to reach the 
desired result with sugar rather than vinegar. Threats are little more than annoy-
ing and ineffective when you do not have the legal support to carry them out.
With regard to removal of comments that you posted on someone else’s 
website, a U.S. court is likely to hold that you donated your comments to the site 
and the website’s owner may treat them in any way it pleases. However, if you 
are concerned about such content, you should carefully read the online “Terms 
of Use” for the website in question. Frequently these terms discuss how your 
information will be treated and may provide an address to direct concerns when 
you want something withdrawn from their site.
You are likely to find that under the website’s Terms of Use, all informa-
tion posted on the site by any person belongs to the website operator and that 
operator has reserved the right to treat such information in any way he or she 
desires—keeping it displayed, removing it, or using it in a different context. The 
Terms of Use are not definitive statements of law, but they are often cited by 
courts as the only written contract between the site operator and those people 
who interact with the website. You should review the Terms of Use for sites 
where you deposit comments or content so that you have some understanding of 
how the site’s operators will treat that content if you want it removed.
Just because a website provides itself with broad rights over your submis-
sions does not mean that it will ignore your pleas to remove the content. For

example, CBS Sports, one of the most popular sports fan sites on the Web, 
reserves to itself an almost comical amount of power over user submissions 
to its sports blogs and comment pages. The CBS Interactive Terms of Use 
states,
When you provide User Submissions, you grant to CBS Interactive and its 
affiliates and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, 
irrevocable, fully sublicenseable license to use, reproduce, archive, edit, trans-
late, create derivative works of, make available, distribute, sell, display, perform, 
transmit, broadcast and in any other way exploit those User Submissions, and 
any names, voices, likenesses and other identifying information of persons that 
is part of those User Submissions, in any form, media, software, or technology 
of any kind now known or developed in the future, including, without limita-
tion, for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products. You hereby waive 
any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions.1
CBS provides several paragraphs of detail about how they plan to treat your 
submissions but also agrees to allow you to remove them when you choose. In its 
Terms of Use, CBS likewise provides contact links for you to make complaints 
or requests relating to the website.
Most responsible webmasters and most well-regarded commercial Internet 
businesses will respond to content removal requests. One of the most important 
legal protections for the operators of Internet media sites is the safe harbor 
provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This act requires that sites 
remove content that appears to violate a copyright. The act also provides legal 
protection for a website operator who acts promptly to remove certain content 
once it receives notice that the content infringes on a copyright. Courts have 
upheld this law for treatment of online subject matter that may violate rights 
other than copyright, including defamatory content, offensive content, and 
content that violates laws (such as child pornography). For this reason, most 
responsible media sites have instituted a procedure for taking down material 
when a person makes that request.
Once you formally request that a comment about you be removed because 
it is defamatory or it violates another legal right, an enormous company such as 
Google or Yahoo! would first send a message to the person whose comment you 
are asking to remove, detailing your accusations and asking for a response. If that 
person does not respond or is unable to adequately defend the content he posted, 
then the website operator will likely remove the content from its site.
Google was the target of the Italian government, which accused the com-
pany of allowing illegal content to be uploaded and to remain on the Google 
site. The criminal suit called into question the standard method that Google and 
many other sites use to decide issues of content removal.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
118
Someone uploaded a video onto the Google Video site that showed several 
boys tormenting a child with Down syndrome. When requested to remove the 
video from its service, Google did so. But that wasn’t good enough for Italian 
authorities, who pursued a criminal action against Google and several executives 
of the company on charges of violating personal privacy because they allowed 
the video to be posted and didn’t remove it quickly enough. On February 24, 
2010, a court in Milan convicted three Google executives and imposed a sus-
pended six months’ jail sentence on the Google decision makers. More than two 
years later, an appeals court in Milan overturned the judgment and vacated the 
Google executives’ jail sentence. Knowing that a U.S. safe harbor exists for tak-
ing down offending content when requested, and also knowing that courts can 
impose possible penalties such as six months spent in an Italian jail for delayed 
removal of offensive content, many commercial and media sites now respond 
more quickly to such requests.
Simply asking a site to remove pictures, comments, or video can frequently 
bring the desired response from website operators. Often their self-interest dic-
tates that they should pull a picture down rather than keep it online at the risk 
of a lawsuit. Of course, it helps if you can show a legal reason for wanting the 
content removed. If you claim that the content defames you or breaches your 
intellectual property rights, then you are more likely to get action. If the content 
is merely embarrassing, then the site displaying it will be less likely to remove it. 
Many sites are much more likely to allow easy removal of your own comments 
and content, but a request to pull down the content provided by other people 
triggers a longer and less accommodating process.
If an e-mail or phone call or letter to the people who run the website doesn’t 
work, you may want to take the step of asking a lawyer to send the request on 
your behalf. For many companies, receiving a lawyer’s letter places the request 
in a different category because it increases the possibility of litigation. To many 
executives, the involvement of an attorney in a dispute raises the stakes of ignor-
ing the request. Also, the more powerful and conservative legal department 
handles letters from attorneys, rather than the customer service organization, 
which often has little power to make a change. Therefore, many online compa-
nies that ignore your personal plea to remove content from their sites will respect 
the same request from your lawyer. Check to see if you qualify for the right to 
be forgotten under the laws of California or the European Union as discussed 
in chapter 8.

you can keep your Internet persona looking sharp by cleaning out the old irrel-
evant content, and the content that may describe your former self—before the 
job, before the move, before the wedding. Next, it’s time to add fresh, positive 
content. You can take a page from the corporate playbook to regularly add affir-
mative content to the Web that can shape the way people think about you. If 
the most recent items about you are five years old, viewers will justifiably wonder 
what you have been doing in the meantime. Finally, make sure people can easily 
find that positive content.
When you’re done you can step back and admire your work. You’ve never 
looked better.
You can follow certain models for creating new, positive content about you 
online and building the persona you want. You can also make sure people can 
find that content easily.
Do What Corporations Do
For more than a decade corporations have worked hard to manage their 
images on the Internet. They hire people to read blogs and complaint sites, to 
analyze news stories, and to lurk on hacker message boards to find negative posts 
about the company. They buy software and services that tell them every time they 
are mentioned and in what context people are chatting about them. And when 
they perceive a weakness in perception of the corporation or a problem that won’t 
go away, companies take proactive steps to manage their online reputations.
Companies encourage their executives or their customer service professionals 
to create blogs about company products. They develop Facebook networks and 
show outtakes from their television commercial campaigns on YouTube. Corpo-
rations reach out to customers with online sweepstakes and enter-your-own-song 
contests. They hire other companies to manage emergency messaging or search 
engine optimization so that customers see the best possible corporate face.
Many of the corporate tools, tricks, and transformations are not practical 
for regular people to use in managing their online persona. For example, it is 
unlikely that you will be establishing a corporate-sponsored online chat forum 
or hiring bloggers to speak highly of you. In addition, you probably will not be 
proactively influencing an industry segment by carpet bombing online sites with 
positive news about you. However, you can learn about managing your online 
image by observing how corporations manage theirs.
For example, some of the most well-regarded consumer companies operat-
ing in the United States will take a proactive approach toward specific people 
who speak negatively about them online. They know that some critics can never 
be appeased, but others simply need more information and attention; those 
critics need to see that a targeted company cares about their concerns. So the 
targeted businesses directly address what they believe to be unfair criticism by 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
120
engaging with the critics and finding out what can be done to make those critics 
feel better about the company. Often such criticism is a cry in the wilderness for 
a customer who feels ignored, and in those cases, direct and honest contact can 
help remove unwanted bad publicity from the Web.
Similarly, when you find information trashing you online, stop and think 
about the motivations of the writer. Although you will never be able to influence 
some people, many critics will appreciate a direct and honest approach request-
ing that the offending criticism be removed from the Web. The Internet’s 
impersonality often makes it easier for people to comment in ways that they 
would never use in person. Confronting those people in a polite and honest way 
may be the best method to win their approval and loyalty.
A related corporate strategy involves joining an online conversation that is 
likely to affect you. If you, your family, your business, your military unit, your 
church or temple, or your neighborhood is discussed in any detail in an online 
forum, chat room, or discussion thread, you could join the conversation and steer 
the discussion in the direction you think it should follow. Actively participating 
in a discussion could be the best way to manage your online reputation. 
Create Positive Content
One of the most common, but least discussed, corporate strategies for online 
image-building involves creation and Internet publication of new, favorable 
material so that the positive information offsets any negative information, or the 
positive information pushes the negative information so far down on the natural 
search results for Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and other search engines that people 
hardly ever see it.
Pushing a troublesome story or picture about you down one page has a 
stupendously significant implication on the number of people who might see it. 
Pushing the same item to the third page nearly drops it entirely off the map. A 
company called Chitika Insights studied click-through rates of each position on 
the first and second pages of a search engine query. They found that 94 percent 
of users clicked on an item that appeared on the first page of search results, 
and that less than 6 percent of people clicked to the second page of results and 
selected an item on that page. 
Knowing this fact, you can see how adding a few items of relevant content 
about yourself to the general Internet pool of data can change people’s opinion 
of you quickly.
Creating your own data is easy enough. Simply develop social media profiles 
and information on websites that discuss the aspect of your life or your online 
image that you want to address. The more information you add in different 
locations, the greater the chance is that people looking for data about you will 
see this information.

When asked how a person can communicate a positive image online, 
Baltimore-based corporate image consultant Henry Fawell advises:
Inoculate, inoculate, inoculate. Build resistance to harmful content by being 
proactive, using good judgment, and using what is essentially free advertising 
in today’s technology. In addition to building profiles at well-known social 
media outlets, identify blogs and media sites that cover areas of interest in your 
career or life and publish thoughtful comments on them. For instance, I will 
occasionally comment on articles at Harvard Business Review’s blog, charitable 
sites, or other strategic communications blogs. Doing so aligns me with posi-
tive brands and causes. I will also include a link to my company’s website to 
generate free traffic.
The more positive material exists about you on the Web, the more likely 
someone will develop a positive impression when they look for information 
about you.
Positive information can be as simple as a description of your specialty at 
work and how much you love growing better at your job. It can mean a full 
discussion of a charity you support or one of your hobbies. Posting positive data 
about yourself may be as easy as providing a list of your schools and affiliations, 
or any awards you might have received. Show aspects of your personality that 
you want people to know about. 
Help People Find You
Search engine optimization has been an obsession of many businesses since 
search engines became the primary means of finding information online. Some 
companies have taken extreme steps to move themselves up in search engine 
rankings and to make sure that a Google search quickly finds the information 
that the companies want you to see.
In February 2011, the New York Times published a story about the actions 
that retailer JCPenney took to manipulate the findings of Google searches. 
JCPenney admitted to using questionable techniques to fool the Google search 
algorithm, and Google subsequently punished JCPenney by dropping its links 
much further down on the natural search lists. The article also noted that 
Google had given BMW the “death penalty” in 2006, dropping its site com-
pletely from many search results because of “black hat” manipulation of searches 
that Google views as cheating.
Many of the companies you work with and respect also take steps to mas-
sage search engine results without resorting to the Internet equivalent of dirty 
tricks. You can learn from their examples, pushing negative information about 
you down onto the second, third, or tenth page of search results where it will be 
unlikely to be seen by anyone searching using your name.

Write!
Writing and posting new, positive content is important. You can open 
profiles on different types of social networking sites, including LinkedIn for 
business connections. You can publish information that you want people to see 
about you on your own Web page. Writing about general topics in your area of 
expertise can advance the conversation for everyone, but it is also a good way to 
generate the links that today’s search engines prize. Interesting content brings

If you are deeply concerned about policing your online persona, then you can 
take a page from the corporate playbook and hire a specialist. Reputation.
com, once known as Reputation Defender, offers services to protect your 
image online and to hunt down and remove problem data as they arise on 
the Web.
Founder and current chief executive officer Michael Fertik says he started 
the company because he was disturbed to see young people haunted by 
lapses of judgment, and he wanted to provide a service to help clean up an 
online reputation. He is concerned about the inaccurate impressions that 
anyone can receive online. Fertik was quoted in the Washington Post as say-
ing, “Google’s not in business to give you the truth, it’s in business to give 
you what they think is relevant.”*
Reputation.com offers a number of services, including MyPrivacy, which 
monitors the Internet for instances of your personal information published 
on different sites. The MyPrivacy service may request that the website oper-
ator remove the personal data in certain circumstances. Another interesting 
service is MyReputation, which purports to control what other people see 
when they search for you and helps you create and publish positive content 
to manage your online image. The company also has business products to 
assist companies in managing their reputations.
If the prospect of managing your online persona is overwhelming to you, 
a company like Reputation.com can help make the prospect easier for a fee. 
It might be the guidance you need to stay ahead of the Internet information 
machine.

in viewers, links, and higher search rankings. Use keywords that are likely to be 
used in searches in headings on your site or page and generate as much content 
as you can so search results are filled with positive images of you. One of the 
great aspects of the Internet is that it seems to value short, pithy, interesting 
content to long, boring detailed articles. This should make your writing job 
easier knowing you can pack a greater punch with a series of smaller articles and 
interlinking them.
Taking charge of your online persona and actively managing your image can 
be an easy way to present yourself in the best possible light online.

Protecting Identity in a Crisis
Identity Theft and Defamation
B
ecause of certain characteristics of the Internet—the ability to perform 
tasks anonymously from a distance and quick, easy publication to the 
world—the number and variety of serious identity and reputation crises 
are growing, and you could be the next victim.
The Internet, like any area populated by humans, contains predators, prank-
sters, liars, and thieves. Although there are dozens of reasons why someone 
might want to adopt your Internet persona, in this chapter we will discuss the 
two most prevalent: identity theft, where another person pretends to be you to 
get money; and image impersonation, where another person pretends to be you 
for fun, malice, or to damage your reputation.
Identity Theft
Identity theft will continue to evolve and grow as a cybercrime of choice for 
fraudsters. One source of information that helps cybercriminals to steal your 
identity is a data breach. When they break into the data stores and treasure 
troves of information about you, they have what they need to unlock the keys 
to your identity. 
The Size of the Problem
Just how big is the data breach problem and its downstream impacts on 
identity theft? Data breaches were up 46 percent from 2013 and hit a whopping 
worldwide total of 1,540 reported breaches in 2014.1 That volume of breaches 
gets put in perspective when you realize that the data compromise involved more 
than one billion records.2
It is estimated that 54 percent of the global data breaches had an identity 
theft-based motive.3 In fact, identity theft is considered the fastest-growing 
crime in the world. The worst ten countries for identity theft, from best to worst 
are: Mexico, the United States, India, the United Arab Emirates, China, United 
Kingdom, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, and South Africa.4

PROTECTING IDENTITY IN A CRISIS
125
According to the 2015 Javelin Strategy and Research report, someone was a 
victim of identity theft in the United States every two seconds last year.5
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that more than 
330,000 identity theft complaints were received from consumers in 2015, 
making it the top complaint for the fifteenth year in a row.6 The problem is 
so great that President Barack Obama has appointed an identity fraud task 
force.
Your identity is more vulnerable on the Internet than almost anywhere 
else because you regularly give your valuable information to people you cannot 
see and bad guys are continuously pinging your Internet connection, looking 
for weaknesses. If you have good credit, money in the bank, health insurance, 
citizenship, a passport, or own a house, someone would like to use your good 
fortune for their own purposes.
Crooks don’t need to take your entire life to gain access to your credit or 
your health plan, they just need to collect a few important numbers and facts and 
then use that information to apply for new accounts or to drain yours. Certain 
sites charge criminals a flat fee to buy useful sets of financial or healthcare data 
that have been stolen or exposed, and anyone who buys those data is likely to 
use it for illicit purposes.
The Growth of ID Theft Online
We hit a major milestone in 2009. According to a Symantec press release, 
Internet crime outpaced illegal drug trafficking and sales as the major criminal 
profit maker. Symantec indicated that in 2009 a crime occurred in New York 
City every three and half minutes, whereas an identity is stolen online every 
three seconds.7

This simple rule, also known as the “mom and grandmom rule,” requires no 
software. If you would not want people to drive by your billboard and see 
something posted there (or you wouldn’t want your mom or grandmom to 
see it), don’t put it online.
Also, be guarded about how much information you post about yourself 
online, including answering those quizzes on Facebook that look harmless. 
Those posts and quizzes hand out information to friend and foe alike.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
126
The Internet is global, and so criminals have built far-reaching global 
enterprises. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), 
one place where criminals watch for victims is on Internet auction sites such 
as Craigslist or eBay. The seller of an auction item sets up shop and appears to 
be U.S. based. If the only form of payment accepted is wire transfer to a bank, 
services such as Western Union, or an escrow service of their choosing, be suspi-
cious. Such criminals often route dollars through Latvia, Belarus, or Romania.
PayPal released a study of identity theft online and found that citizens in 
Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States are the most frequent 
victims of Internet identity theft. It’s believed that this is because the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada have the highest volume of online 
e-commerce.8
Your information, credit card number, and bank account data are bought 
and sold online as if they were the hottest item on the Amazon.com holiday 
wish list. The person running this criminal auction may appear to be the boy 
next door. One alleged criminal auctioneer was arrested in the United Kingdom. 
He was thirty-three years old, worked at a Pizza Hut, and hung out in Internet 
cafes. He created a site called “DarkMarket,” and it allowed criminals to buy, 
sell, and trade private and personal information. When it was operational, the 
information they had for sale was stunning and included information that could 
allow a criminal to answer your bank account’s secret password questions. Your 
identity is priceless to you, but for roughly thirty British sterling, information for 
all your credit cards may be available at a bundled discount.9
The site also offered its approximately 2,500 global customers online train-
ing to help them be better Internet criminals. Fortunately, the United States and 
the United Kingdom worked together on the case and were able to successfully 
close down the site, arrest the founder, and arrest members in the United States, 
United Kingdom, Russia, Israel, Turkey, Germany, and France. Unfortunately, 
replacement sites are popping up every day and are thriving.

How e-Commerce Sites Protect You
When you agree to accept a check from your neighbor for a basket of veg-
etables, you trust that the check will be honored because you know your neigh-
bor. You recognize her by sight, you know where to find her, and you have a 
personal relationship. You also know that she would be embarrassed to bounce a 
check because that could have an impact on her reputation in your community.
None of these assurances exist when you spend money online.
www.ebook3000.com

PROTECTING IDENTITY IN A CRISIS
127
If you pay for a jacket online, the e-commerce site doesn’t automatically 
trust you. The site will only accept payment by credit card or a verified payment 
system such as PayPal because these methods are intended to minimize fraud 
and bad payments by performing an authorization check before processing the 
payment. If the credit card system authorizes a transaction, then the e-commerce 
merchant knows that this particular card is active, the person has sufficient credit 
available, and the card has not been flagged as stolen.
Sophisticated card issuers will even run the authorization request against algo-
rithms that flag unlikely transactions and refuse authorization until they can contact 
the cardholder. If you have only made purchases in and around St. Louis, Missouri, 
for the past three years, when new purchases spring up in Mexico or Brazil, your 
bank will probably notice the unusual behavior and refuse foreign purchases until 
they can contact you. The card system itself serves as a method of minimizing fraud.
Where ID Theft Comes In
If a person directs his browser to an online store and he has your credit card 
number, the card’s expiration date, and the security number listed on the back 
of your credit card, he can pretend to be you and make a purchase that is sent to 
his house, while the purchase is charged to you.
To make the fraud work, he might need your address, but he can find that 
in a public directory. The e-commerce merchant won’t know that this person 
is not you. How could he? All a site knows about you is the information that is 
entered about you.
Even if you are careful about exposing your credit card, other people still 
have access to a great deal of information that allows them to pretend to be you. 
Many of the workers at your bank have this type of information. Workers at 
stores where you shop or waiters at restaurants where you eat have access to the 
data, and so do third-party card processors. Anywhere you use a card, its valu-
able information is exposed again and again.
If your identity is stolen online, the damage does not always remain online. 
An identity thief who has enough information about you can open new credit 
accounts in your name, establish phone service in your name, or file fraudulent 
tax returns in your name. She may even file bankruptcy under your name to 
avoid eviction from an apartment that he or she rented using your name. Some 
identity thieves steal information to qualify for healthcare payments or to get an 
identity that will allow an illegal alien to stay in the United States.
Protecting Yourself against ID Theft
Although credit cards provide a tool for thieves to steal your identity, your 
liability for any credit card fraud is limited. A more significant identity theft 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
128
issue involves your bank accounts. Unfortunately, your bank may not limit your 
liability as credit card companies do. You just might find yourself fighting to 
prove that you were not the one who drained the money out of all your accounts.
The famous gentleman thief of the 1930s, Willie Sutton, claimed to rob 
banks “because that’s where the money is.” Whereas Willie Sutton was known 
to visit the bank manager’s house at night and then walk in with him in the 
morning to open the vaults before anyone arrived, a modern-day bank robber 
would only need to steal your account number and then point his or her Internet 
browser to your bank’s website.
Get in the Privacy Habit
You can do everything right and still be a victim of identity theft as a result 
of data breaches or other mistakes that are no fault of your own. Still, you should 
be informed about risks and what you can do to minimize them.
There are technology tools a crook can use to steal your information, how-
ever, it could be your own behavior putting you at risk. Be careful with your 
account information. Not everybody can remember all the account passwords 
and codes he or she needs for each online financial account, so some people 
write them down. It is better not to write down your banking codes, but if you 
have to, simply keep these numbers locked up and away from your computer 
where someone else can’t easily find and use the information. You might want 
to write this information in the middle of a string of nonsense words and char-
acters, so you only need to memorize the first and last letter in the chain.
Account access can be compromised by simple codes and good guessers, so 
get in the habit of choosing passwords that are long, and contain a combination 
of uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and numbers. These would be 
difficult for someone to guess.

Your best bet for heading off identity thieves and would-be defamers is to 
stop people from getting to you or your information online in the first place. 
There are many ways to protect yourself from prying eyes. Here are a few 
easy and free ways that you can use to protect yourself from snoops.
Turn Off Geocodes. Every camera and smartphone that supports the feature 
provides options to turn off geocodes. Check your operating manual for

instructions. A warning, though: If you turn off the geocoding function, you 
lose your ability to use the GPS function until you enable geocoding again.
Check Your Browser Settings. Depending on which browser you use, there are 
a variety of settings available to protect your privacy. Most browsers, with 
only a few mouse clicks, allow you to “empty cache,” set security to “high,” 
warn you before a cookie is installed, and set up “private browsing.”
Anonymizers. An anonymizer, quite logically, helps to make you anonymous 
online. However, it does not work like an invisible cloak to turn you into an 
Internet user who leaves no traces. What it can do is help make your Inter-
net surfing activity harder to trace. Anonymizers hide your surfing behind a 
proxy server, essentially another computer that acts as the go-between from 
your computer to the Internet. One example is Google Chrome. Google 
Chrome offers a feature called “Incognito Mode.” Any cookies or tracking 
that is done while you surf the Net are deleted after you terminate your 
Internet session. Such a program can be useful in protecting your privacy 
and personal information. Unfortunately, it can also help evil-minded peek-
ers and gawkers to hide themselves and make them harder to track down. 
And remember, these guys are experts at using this type of technology.
Do Not Track. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States has been 
considering implementing a “do not track” law for companies with a Web 
presence. The agency sees this law as a simple tool that would work a lot like 
the “do not call” phone registry for telemarketers. A lot of issues will have 
to be debated before legislation is approved. In the meantime, you can take 
matters into your own hands by using your browser settings. Many brows-
ers currently either have a “do not track” option or they are developing one 
based upon customer feedback. One example is Mozilla’s Firefox browser 
versions in 2016, which allow you to decide whether you want to be tracked 
as you surf the Net or conduct business online and includes a “forget button” 
removing browsing information from your history.
Technology Solutions. If you only have fifteen minutes, at a minimum try 
these two technology options:
•  Browser settings: Decide how much privacy you need, make the appropri-
ate settings, and test and check these settings regularly.
•  Privacy settings on social networks: These are not foolproof, and technol-
ogy glitches and new releases tend to reset your privacy settings so your 
information is available to the widest audience. Still, it’s worth the time it 
takes to check your settings and make them as private as possible.

Password Overload
The most traditionally overused passwords around the world are still pretty 
common. Password and 123456 might be easy to remember but you are making 
it easy for hackers to get into your account if you use them. 
SplashData released its 2015 annual “Worst Passwords List,” and in the top 
twenty-five there are sports-themed passwords such as baseball and football and 
passwords such as dragon related to favorite TV shows like Game of Thrones.
The study reviewed all the leaked IDs and passwords published online, 
looking at more than three million passwords. Here are some key findings:
•  Most of the hacked and popular passwords were six characters long or 
less.
•  Many of the passwords were just a word that can be found in a dic-
tionary.
•  Passwords such as superman, batman, and dragon were new on the top 
twenty-five list this year.
Where do you keep track of your passwords? In a notebook? Maybe you 
have them written on sticky notes posted around your computer desk. Many of 
us choose that route because we aren’t so sure what else to do. There are some 
new advances in storing information online that might make online vaults a bet-
ter option for your passwords. 
Online vaults store passwords for you and many of them will check sites 
to see if they are phishing or fake sites. Many vault services will also provide 
password generation to help you create strong passwords. Several services now 
require two-factor authentication (e.g., sending a text of a verification code to 
your cell phone on file) before you can open the vault.
Before you use one of these free or inexpensive services:
•  Do your homework.
•  Read the privacy policy.
•  Type into your favorite search engine the name of the service and the 
word breach to see if any breaches pop up.
A few password vault services that you might try are:
•  LastPass
•  KeePass
•  1Password
Remember, all technology, including that used in password vaults, is hack-
able. To protect your information, follow these steps:
www.ebook3000.com

PROTECTING IDENTITY IN A CRISIS
131
1.  Protect your password manager with a strong password. It can be 
something that you write down and keep in your wallet.
2.  Look for a password vault that times out and requires you to login 
again after a few minutes of inactivity.
3.  Use two-factor authentication every time it is offered at a site.
Get Technology on Your Side
Be careful about letting others use the computer that you use to access 
your bank accounts, either in person or remotely. Someone who uses or has 
access to your computer via your Internet connection can download mali-
cious software onto the machine and can use that software to capture your 
bank passcodes. In addition, it is possible to download keystroke monitoring 
software to your computer that allows a crook to track every password and 
account number as you enter them into websites. To stop the download of 
such programs, turn on a firewall, such as the one built into Windows and 
Apple operating systems.
Keystroke logging software is one type of malicious software, but it’s not 
the only one. Malicious software includes computer viruses and spyware, which 
can also be downloaded onto your system when you open an e-mail attachment 
or click a link on a website. Follow this advice to get technology on your side:
•  Be sure that you know the source of each file that you load onto your 
computer and that you trust the business or person that sponsors or 
offers the download.
•  Install antivirus and antispyware software such as Sophos or Syman-
tec Antivirus and be sure to keep the definitions for current malware 
updated on a regular basis.
•  Your browser also offers protections if you set it up to block you from 
all but trusted sites and to flag sites that have a history of downloading 
spyware onto visitors’ computers.
•  Malware is often transmitted in attachments to e-mails that are sent 
to your computer. A virus can, in fact, be contained in a single pixel 
of a picture you click on in an e-mail. You should be cautious about 
clicking on links in e-mail messages that could take you to dangerous 
sites, and never open file attachments from people you do not know.
•  Even some of your most trusted sites can have poison links, also 
known as malvertising. These are advertisements that lead your 
browser to dangerous sites. When you go to those sites, poison link 
developers try to download malicious software onto your system. 
Top websites such as the NewYorkTimes.com and Gizmodo.com (a 
technology site that boasts as many as three million page views a day) 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
132
have accidentally hosted advertisements that linked to malicious or 
fraudulent content.
•  Some identity thieves have become sophisticated at developing soft-
ware that takes over your account and sends out e-mails under your 
name with malicious attachments. Be aware that opening attachments 
from a friend’s e-mail or a business associate’s e-mail could also be 
risky, so if you’re not expecting the attachment, you may want to call 
before you click.
•  Remember that your browser or e-mail program can be set to block 
the opening of e-mail attachments or to look for suspicious junk mail.
Going Phishing
Phishing is a fraudulent activity that involves a criminal sending out e-mail 
that appears to be sponsored by someone familiar to you, such as your bank, 
insurance company, or an online retailer. The fraudulent e-mail will ask you to 
click on a link to access or update your account, visit a fraudulent site, download 
certain software, or enter your account number, passwords, or Social Security 
number. If you take any of these actions, you have just given the thieves what 
they need to steal from your accounts. Around the globe in the second half of 
2014 there were at least 123,972 unique phishing attacks where the cybercrimi-
nals posed as a trusted person or organization.10
It’s hard for the companies you know and trust to shut down phishing. 
Often criminals pretend to be someone or be employed by a company to lull 
you into a false sense of security. You can usually spot a phishing scam by some 
telltale signs, including the following:
•  One or more links in the e-mail that you are instructed to click. Note 
that on a Windows computer, you can right-click on such a link and see 
its properties; does the address look like a legitimate business website?
•  Bad grammar, spelling, or punctuation that an institution would never 
send out.
•  An odd sender’s address in the e-mail header.
•  Missing or badly executed company logos.
•  The e-mail is not addressed to you personally but to “Member” or 
“Customer.”
•  The message urges quick action involving some problem with your 
account, usually involving clicking on a link and entering your account 
information.
Never provide your most secret information—account numbers, Social 
Security numbers, passcodes, or your children’s information—unless it’s as part 
www.ebook3000.com

PROTECTING IDENTITY IN A CRISIS
133
of a transaction on a trusted site. Trustworthy business contacts and merchants 
would never ask for this information if you are not completing a transaction on 
their sites, so call them and confirm that they sent the e-mail.
You can also go to their site to find out if a communication is legitimate, 
but don’t do it by clicking a link in the e-mail; instead, type the URL for their 
website into your browser yourself. Be sure not to call the number offered by 
the e-mail for requesting the information. Find the phone number for customer 
service on your account statement instead.
If you do see a suspicious e-mail that purports to be from your favorite per-
son, company, or organization, make an attempt to notify them. In addition, you 
can also do a global good deed by reporting them to the Anti Phishing Work-
ing Group (APWG). You can forward the phishing e-mail to reportphishing@
apwg.org.
Sneaky Geocodes
Most of us know not to post pictures of the local sites while on vacation 
because that lets people know you’re not home. You may know it’s not a good 
idea to tag a lot of photos of your family at home with geocodes because people 
with ill intentions can track you down. But did you realize that you should be 
careful of the pictures you take of your pets, too? This applies to pictures taken 
with a smartphone or with a newer model point-and-shoot camera that embeds 
geocodes into the digital photos you take.
Owen Mundy, an assistant professor at Florida State University, created an 
app called “I Know Where Your Cat Lives.” He randomly selects one million pic-
tures from the Web that include the word cat. He then uses the picture’s metadata 
to show the exact coordinates of where the cat was when the shot was taken. Try it 
out to see this important Internet identity lesson: http://iknowwhereyourcatlives

I’ve Been Hacked!
Remember that your credit card information, Social Security number, or 
other personally identifiable information could be stolen when a company’s own 
system is broken into. Since 2005, many well-known companies have reported 
that information was stolen by crooks attacking their systems (called hacking), 
by laptops being misplaced or stolen, or from theft by company insiders. The list 
includes TJX (the parent company of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls), MasterCard, 
Sony, Citibank, and the U.S. Veterans’ Administration. The global breaches in 
2015 that made the headlines with four million or more records compromised 
included: U.S.-based Anthem Health Insurance (78.8 million), U.S.-based 
Office of Personnel Management (21.5 million), U.K.-based cell phone com-
pany TalkTalk (4 million), followed by the Turkish Government (50 million),

Topface (20 million), Hello Kitty’s user database (3 million), VTech toy maker’s

Todd Inskeep is a cybersecurity expert at Booz Allen Hamilton and 
president of Incovate Solutions, LLC, in Charlotte, North Carolina. His 
previous jobs include data security positions for Bank of America and the 
U.S. National Security Agency. We asked Todd about how merchants and 
banks guard against identity theft, and Todd responded with this comment:
Merchants generally trust that if someone is ordering something they want to 
receive the product or services, so the address, e-mail address, and even credit card 
information is usually valid. However, to prevent and manage fraud [or identity 
theft], merchants also check this information against commercial information 
sources. For example, the U.S. Post Office and others sell information about 
valid home addresses that merchants can check—so they don’t send boxes to 
non-existent homes. The credit card companies let merchants quickly check valid 
credit card numbers and the security code at a low cost, further encouraging the 
merchant. Some merchants track other information like the Internet address of 
your computer (IP address). They might suspect something if your home address 
is Detroit, but your computer is based in Budapest. Merchants also use the credit 
or debit card billing address and other information to try and validate that it’s really 
you buying their goods.
Bigger merchants like Walmart can manage fraud better than a smaller com-
pany. And some small companies could literally go bankrupt from a single large 
fraud.
In many cases merchants will allow a purchase and ship the goods as the appar-
ent purchaser instructs. In those cases the credit or debit card purchasing rules pro-
tect you, the consumer. Usually when you report any fraud, every bank and credit 
union I know of refunds you promptly, usually within 2–3 days. In rare cases, like if 
you waited six months or a year to report a fraud, the bank might limit the refund. 
Then the bank and the merchant determine who actually loses money based on the 
credit card operating rules.
Online banking is actually one of the best ways to combat identity theft. It lets 
you check your money and history frequently so you find unexpected problems 
quickly. By checking frequently you can avoid spending too much. Most banks 
offer online bill payment, [which] is even better. You can lower the costs of writing 
checks, buying stamps and mailing bills. You also avoid mailing checks which can 
get lost or stolen, leading to identity theft. Check fraud is actually a much bigger 
problem than online credit card identity theft.

Data breaches at service providers such as the e-mail marketing firm Epsilon 
affect customers of many well-known companies. In these cases, the affected 
business is likely to notify you that your account was compromised, and your 
bank may issue you a new credit card or a new account number. However, there 
is no substitution for reviewing your account statements every month and for 
checking your credit reports at least once a year.
What to Do If You’re a Victim
When it comes to credit card fraud, the system itself provides protections for 
you. A victim of identity theft should quickly order a copy of his or her credit 
report to check accounts for financial transactions that he or she doesn’t remem-
ber. As soon as you notice a problem on your bill or that your card is missing, 
you can cancel all transactions, or only those that you don’t recognize. Under 
the bank’s credit card contract, you will only be liable for fifty dollars of fraudu-
lent purchases made in your name as long as you carefully police your account. 
Faithfully read your statements each month to catch the fraud right away. If 
you alert your bank to any fraud in a timely manner, it’s likely to credit all the 
fraudulent purchases back to your account, minus the fifty-dollar maximum 
charge. Although requesting a replacement card and updating the new card 
number for your various accounts is a hassle, it beats paying your life savings for 
someone else’s purchases.
Beyond credit card fraud, you have certain legal protections. Identity theft 
itself is a crime. While you could file a lawsuit in civil court against your identity 
thief if you can find him or her, you should first treat any serious identity theft 
as a criminal matter. If you are a victim of identity theft, file a police report with 
your local authorities.
You should also follow the instructions and recommendations of the FTC 
site on identity theft (https://www.identitytheft.gov). The FTC not only pro-
vides the most up-to-date information on fighting identity theft and managing 
your life once your identity has been stolen but it also includes specific sites and 
addresses to help you. The FTC site discusses products and services that you 
might obtain to help clear your name, and it answers the most common ques-
tions that people ask when their identities have been stolen. The site includes 
information for businesses that have lost their customer’s information and 
resources for law enforcement and anyone else who wants to fight identity theft. 
The FTC’s guides to detecting, deterring, and defending against identity theft 
include videos and are easy to understand. In short, this site should be your first 
stop for protecting yourself in a suspected case of identity theft.
You should also immediately file a report with the FTC when you know 
that your credit and name are being used in an identity theft scam. Sharing 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
136
your information with the FTC will help law enforcement track and capture 
the thieves. You may have been caught up in a large-scale fraud and, if so, the 
report you file with the FTC might help solve the crime or return your money 
to you.
When you are attempting to convince banks, retailers, or others fooled by a 
thief who abused your account, each merchant or bank will ask to see a copy of 
the police report and the FTC report that you filed concerning the identity theft. 
They ask for this because they know that it is a crime to file a false police report, 
so if you can show a copy of your report, then you are more likely to be telling 
the truth to them and not merely attempting to escape from paying a debt.
If your identity has been stolen, you should also immediately shut down all 
accounts that were opened in your name by the identity thief. The more quickly 
you close these accounts, the faster you will stop the identity thief’s activities.
You should also place a fraud alert with all three of the major credit report-
ing agencies: TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. This will notify all prospec-
tive creditors that someone is using your name and credit to commit fraud and 
will stop the thief from opening additional accounts in your name. An initial 
fraud alert usually lasts for ninety days, which should be long enough to allow 
you to clean up your credit.
You can also ask the credit reporting agencies to include an extended fraud 
alert in your file, which could be active for years. Fraud alerts should be offered 
to you for free, and each of the credit reporting agencies also offers additional 
credit protection services, usually for a one-time or monthly charge. Under a 
fraud alert, you will receive notice from each credit-reporting agency when any 
new accounts are set up under your name. The free alert is likely to be enough to 
protect your credit by stopping new accounts from being opened in your name, 
but it will not stop ongoing identity theft of your present accounts.
You can take the additional step of placing a credit freeze on your record. 
Under a credit freeze, no one can process a credit application in your name unless 
you lift the freeze. This action stops criminals from opening credit accounts in 
your name. You can temporarily lift a freeze at any time if you want to apply 
for a credit card, car loan, or mortgage, though this might cost you a small fee.
What Do Privacy Laws Protect?
The last twenty years have seen explosive growth in the laws designed to 
protect privacy of personal information. However, much of the information 
that you might consider private or sensitive is not guarded by the laws of the 
United States, and the fact that companies retain information about you or 
that people can find your data online is only legally actionable under limited 
circumstances.

Keeping Finances Secure
For most people, the most important legal data protections for information 
they post online relates to their finances. When you shop online, you generally 
provide your credit card information. The store has to use the card information 
for a specific transaction, and nothing more, unless you give the merchant per-
mission to keep the card on file for future purchases.
Banking information can only be shared in specific circumstances that are 
intended to benefit the banking customer. Everyone who would be exposed to 
your financial information from an online transaction—the merchant that takes 
your credit card, the banks that complete the money transfers, and the compa-
nies that operate the payment systems and/or that process the transaction behind 
the scenes—all are strictly regulated on how they can use and share your data.
These financial data laws have been tested in situations in which merchants 
did not intentionally sell or transfer customers’ financial data but instead hackers 
broke into the business’s computers and stole data.
If your financial information is exposed by or stolen from an online com-
pany, you will receive notice of the security breach and your bank will probably 
issue you a new credit card and cancel the compromised card.
A t  L e a s t  Y o u  H a v e  Y o u r  H e a l t h
In the United States, many of your online activities are not protected by 
privacy laws. The law protects only certain types of information that is used 
in certain ways. For example, information regarding your health is protected 
when you provide it to medical professionals. However, that same medical 
information may not be protected if you share it online in discussions with 
Facebook friends or with a website that asks you to take a quiz about your 
physical fitness.
If you explain the state of your pregnancy to prospective employers at 
Monster.com or to a travel insurance company online, that health informa-
tion may not be protected under law. Similarly, if you share your genetic 
information with an online company promising to provide information 
about your ancestry, the data are not protected by health information laws. 
The law only protects information you provide to certain healthcare profes-
sionals such as doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies so that they can provide 
healthcare analysis or treatment.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
138
Although laws exist that can force banks, merchants, and processors to 
protect your payment and other financial data, those laws are relatively new. 
The results of suing under these laws are uncertain at best. People have sued 
merchants and banks for losing financial information but are often unable to 
prove direct damages to receive significant compensation for the loss. A cus-
tomer whose financial data is exposed may be best served by closing the account 
and requesting that the negligent party who lost the data pay for at least a year 
of credit monitoring services to guard against identity theft arising from the loss 
of information.
Protecting Children
U.S. law protects children’s information online and requires that parents be 
notified when children twelve or younger sign up for contests or accounts on 
websites that will contact the children by e-mail. You have the right to insist that 
C a s e  i n  P o i n t
Between July 2005 and 2007, the website of retail company TJX, owner of 
the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls brands, was hacked by professional criminals. 
TJX admitted losing 45.7 million customer account records, including the 
payment card information from these customers, while banks claimed that 
more than 94 million customer credit cards were affected.* Anyone who 
shopped at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, or one of the other TJX stores (either 
online or at the physical store locations) during this two-year period had 
their financial information exposed to criminal hackers. If your card data 
were lost, you might have been the victim of identity theft.
A total of forty-one state attorneys general sued TJX based on this breach 
and collected nearly ten million dollars in settlement, but only a small frac-
tion was used to assist people whose information was lost.† One of the gang 
of hackers who committed the crime was caught, arrested, prosecuted, and 
sentenced to twenty years in prison.

a company not contact your child or that it send messages to your child through 
your e-mail account.
One of the practical problems with online child protection is that, even 
when a business is being careful and follows the law, kids often lie about their 
age to gain access to websites. In effect, the business has no way of knowing that 
its new customer is a child.
This is one of many reasons to watch your child’s Internet usage carefully. 
If your child leaves an Internet trail that wrongly lists his or her age as older, his 
or her own Internet persona will be distorted and could expose him or her to 
adult risks that he or she is neither mentally nor emotionally prepared to handle.
Differences around the World
Many countries are much more protective of an individual’s personal data 
than the United States. U.S. laws have grown to reflect a protection of business 
interests balanced with the interests of individuals to keep certain classes of 
data private. Other countries, such as Canada, Mexico, and the nations of the 
European Union, regard the privacy of sensitive data as a human right to be 
protected from business and government in nearly all instances. In these juris-
dictions, a business that takes personal or sensitive information from a citizen 
can only use the information for the reason it was offered and must receive per-
mission to do anything more with the data or to pass them on to third parties. 
As evidence of this, in 2016 the European Union approved new data protection 
regulations. The new laws state that if a company violates the consumer protec-
tions they put into place, they could be held liable and be forced to pay up to 
4 percent of their revenues in reparations to the aggrieved consumers.12
Understanding the Responsibilities of Websites
You can help to protect your own information by understanding how the web-
sites you visit intend to treat you and your data. Most commercial sites that you 
visit on the Internet have a posted privacy policy that explains how the site’s 
owner uses the data you provide. These privacy policies are policed by state 
attorneys general and by federal agencies, so they must be accurate as a company 
can be subject to significant regulatory penalties if they aren’t.
For example, in early 2011, the FTC signed a consent order with Google 
subjecting the company to independent privacy audits every two years for the 
next twenty years. The FTC claimed that a now-terminated service called 
Google Buzz treated information differently than was explained in its privacy 
policies. Commenting on the Google settlement following the FTC’s inves-
tigation, FTC chairman Jon Leibowitz said, “When companies make privacy 
pledges, they need to honor them. This is a tough settlement that ensures that 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
140
Google will honor its commitments to consumers and build strong privacy 
protections into all of its operations.”13 The FTC has even filed claims in bank-
ruptcy court to stop the sale of a bankrupt company’s consumer information 
collected from its website because the sale would violate the defunct company’s 
online privacy policy.
When you review an online privacy policy, look at what information the 
company will collect from you and what limits the company places on the use 
of this information. Many companies claim that they will never share your 
personally identifiable information with any other entity. This is the strongest 
protection that you can expect from any website operator. Other companies 
will claim to share your personal information and addresses only with “affiliated 
companies” or “marketing affiliates.” You may want to contact the site to learn 
what they mean by these terms. Other sites will not limit their sharing of your 
personal information and may be selling your data to any buyer. You may decide 
that it would be wiser to refuse to set up an account or purchase goods from sites 
that are willing to share your data.
Some companies also discuss their data policies in their published Terms of 
Use. These documents will frequently describe the level of control that a com-
mercial or government site keeps over information on that site and how it shares 
information with vendors, advertisers, and marketing affiliates. If you are con-
cerned about how a website will use your information, you should always check 
the privacy policy and Terms of Use, where the site operator is likely to explain, 
or at least hint at, the rules it intends to follow.
Some companies protect your privacy better than others, but based on a 
study, “Ranking Digital Rights,” no company is a true standout.14 This study 
reviewed the privacy policies and user agreements of many big tech companies 
and graded them based on how well they protect you. The survey was run over 
approximately two years and reviewed end-user service agreements, privacy poli-
cies, terms of service, and corporate reports. The survey administrators asked 
thirty-one questions based on the data they collected. They then provided the 
findings to each company for input. Not one company in the report received a 
grade above a “D.” The highest grade went to Google with 65%. However, the 
good news is that tech companies are improving in how they disclose informa-
tion about you and how they might use your data in the future.

and the tweets, each containing constant and outrageous profanity, told a story 
that sometimes tracked the real Rahm Emanuel’s daily routine and other times

by the Atlantic Monthly as “next-level digital political satire and caricature, 
but over the months the account ran, it became much more. By the end, the 
stream resembled an epic, allusive ode to the city of Chicago itself, yearning 
and lyrical.”15 The real Rahm Emanuel offered a $5,000 donation to charity if 
the author impersonating him on the @Mayoremanuel Twitter would reveal 
his identity.
Not every case of online impersonation is clearly meant as good-hearted 
satire. Someone pretending to be you online can insult your friends, accept invi-
tations on your behalf, and make rude comments to members of the opposite 
sex—all in your name. In short, an online impersonator could ruin your reputa-
tion. If information about you is false and is harmful to your reputation, it may 
qualify as defamation.
The Face of Online Impersonation
Internet image impersonation is easy to do. Anyone can open a free e-mail 
account with Yahoo!, Hotmail, Google, or any other e-mail provider and use 
your name. Setting up a social media account on social networking sites such as 
Facebook or Myspace is equally simple. With a little information about your life, 
your impersonator could even fool those people closest to you.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to remove these accounts from the Inter-
net. Most online companies assume that an account is opened in good faith, 
and you will probably have to prove the damage was done by an imposter (and 
prove that the imposter is not simply another person who happens to have the 
same name) before a site such as Yahoo! or Facebook would consider closing an 
active account.
In some cases, the law provides extra ammunition against online imperson-
ators. For example, under California law, it is now illegal to impersonate another 
person online. The statute states, “Any person who knowingly and without 
consent credibly impersonates another actual person through or on an Internet 
Web site or by other electronic means for purposes of harming, intimidating, 
threatening, or defrauding another person is guilty of a public offense.”16
This statute provides a personal cause of action for you to sue somebody 
who impersonates you, and it includes criminal sanctions with up to a year in 
prison for the impersonator. Of course, you would have to convince your local 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
142
California prosecutor to enforce this statute against your impersonator before 
criminal sanctions could be imposed.
Privacy Laws in the United States and Elsewhere
Many countries have totalitarian histories that demonstrate the harm that 
can occur to individuals when personal privacy is not respected. An Italian crimi-
nal prosecution against Google and Google executives for allowing video of a 
sensitive matter to be posted online was based on violations of privacy rights as 
those rights are understood in Italy. It is highly unlikely that a company would 
be liable for criminal sanctions in the United States if that company took down 
the offensive content in a reasonable amount of time.
Although we write more about the European Union’s “Right to Be For-
gotten” in chapter 8, we mention it briefly here because it sets an interesting 
precedent, not just for its member countries but for citizens around the world. 
It’s too early to know what the long-term impact of the European Union’s deci-
sion to enforce a Right to Be Forgotten with technology companies will have. 
However, it’s a safe bet that this is not a passing fad. 
There are concerns that giving you or organizations more control of their 
Internet identity, under a right to be forgotten clause could lead to censure of the 
Internet. Free-speech advocates worry that the vagueness of the EU law could 
lead to pressure for all tech companies, including Google, to scrub results across 
the globe, delinking news stories and other information that may make you look 
bad, but that they consider to be news or historical data. 
Here’s a quick history lesson of how the European Union reached this con-
clusion. A Spanish citizen filed a complaint with Spain’s Data Protection Agency 
and indicated that Google Spain and Google Inc. had violated his privacy rights 
by posting an auction notice that stated that his home had been repossessed. The 
repossession of the home had been resolved years earlier, but because the Internet 
never forgets, the personal data about his financial matters haunted him online. 
This man wanted the newspaper, Google Spain, and Google, Inc., to be 
required to remove the old news so it would not show up in search engine results. 
The Spanish court system reviewed the case and referred it to the EU’s Court of 
Justice. Here is an excerpt of what the May 2014 ruling of the EU Court said: 
“On the ‘Right to be Forgotten’: Individuals have the right—under certain con-
ditions—to ask search engines to remove links with personal information about 
them. This applies where the information is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant 
or excessive for the purposes of the data processing. . . . A case-by-case assess-
ment is needed considering the type of information in question, its sensitivity 
for the individual’s private life and the interest of the public in having access to 
that information. The role the person requesting the deletion plays in public life 
might also be relevant.”17

In the United States, federal law provides a level of immunity for compa-
nies that host online information posted by others. In 1996, fearing that online 
content-hosting companies such as America Online, Yahoo!, and Prodigy 
would self-censor Internet discussions to protect themselves from liability, 
the U.S. Congress passed a law to exempt those companies from liability for 
the information posted on their services. This exemption applied even if the 
information was defamatory or violated copyright or other laws, and even if the 
hosting company acted to manage the content on its service.
This law was passed as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. 
Although other provisions of that act were struck down as unconstitutional, Sec-
tion 230 has stood against all challenges. Practically, Section 230 makes it nearly 
impossible to successfully sue an Internet host for publishing offensive informa-
tion, protecting the wealthiest prospective defendant and leaving you with only 
an individual, who is sometimes anonymous, to sue for the posting.
The bottom line is that information that is covered under U.S. privacy laws 
receives limited protection. Once the data are released into the wilds of the 
Internet, you have no right and probably no ability to chase it down and have 
it removed. To make things worse, once information has been exposed, anyone 
who sees it can copy it and use it, probably without leaving a trail that you can 
follow.
The Role of Civil Law
Some online defamation may violate your legal rights. To address such destruc-
tive online material, it helps to know what laws apply to the Internet. Under-
standing reputational rights under the laws of the United States and the laws 
themselves, which we cover in this section, can help you to protect your reputa-
tion online.
Reputational Rights
Technology changes society faster than the law can react, so U.S. law relating 
to the Internet often lags behind the changes that the Internet brings to our lives. 
Laws protecting people’s online images have therefore been slow to develop.
Some laws, such as those that protect you from defamation, have existed 
since the time of the Roman empire but have not yet been adapted to address 
the reach and speed of information flowing across the Internet. Other laws, such 
as those that protect the privacy of certain personal information, have only been 
passed recently and judicial interpretations that could help us understand how 
privacy laws will be enforced aren’t yet available.
Laws that could be used to clean up your online persona, such as those that 
protect public image, do not exist in many states, and when they do exist, they 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
144
often apply only to the famous. In short, although several categories of law exist 
that might help you to manage and clean up certain aspects of your Internet 
reputation, taking legal action tends to be an inefficient and often ineffective 
solution to many forms of Internet exposure. Still, there are three areas of law 
that may pertain to your situation: defamation, rights of publicity, and privacy 
laws. Privacy laws have been discussed in this chapter in the context of identity 
theft, so let’s take a look at defamation and rights of publicity.
Fighting Falsehoods: Defamation Law
The oldest and best established laws protecting your image address mali-
cious publication of false information, or defamation. Defamation is the act of 
smearing a person’s reputation with false and unprivileged statements with the 
intent to hurt the person or with negligent disregard for the harm being caused. 
Libel is the term for written defamation, and slander is the term for verbal 
defamation.
Winning a defamation case is a public confirmation that the statement 
against you was false, and you may be awarded damages or attorney’s fees if you 
can show that the false statement was particularly malicious.
Defamation law varies around the world. In the United States, celebrities 
must prove that a defamatory statement was made with actual malice, but private 
T o  S u e  o r  N o t  t o  S u e ?
Filing a claim in the courts may be the last resort for righting a wrong, and 
such an action is not appropriate in many situations because filing a suit and 
seeing it through is an expensive proposition all around. Lawsuits drain both 
the plaintiff and the defendant of money, time, energy, and often emotional 
well-being, because each side attacks the other and personal character is 
called into question in a public forum. Win or lose, you still suffer these 
costs, and it is rare that your opponent will be ordered to pay your legal 
fees. You should never rush into a lawsuit without knowing exactly what 
you want to get out of it, understanding that the process is unpredictable. 
There are at least two sides to every story, and many people cannot see the 
other side very well when they are angry or upset. Even if it seems that you 
couldn’t possibly lose, you may still lose. However, lawsuits are the method 
that our society uses to resolve its most difficult disputes.

145
citizens have an easier path to success. As a person who is not considered to be a 
public figure, it’s likely that you only need to establish that the statement made 
about you was false, that the statement caused you harm, and that the statement 
was made without adequate research to determine the truth.
The defamatory statement must also not be privileged. For example, a state-
ment made in a court filing is likely to be privileged even if it meets all the other 
criteria and therefore would not be considered to be defamatory. Also, keep 
in mind that some statements are merely opinion and would not be subject to 
defamation suits. If someone simply called you a “jerk” online, that’s a broadly 
unspecific expression of opinion that probably couldn’t serve as the basis of a 
defamation lawsuit. If the same person calls you a “criminal” or a “philanderer,” 
then you may be able to prove that the statement is false.
Nearly all states in the United States consider certain types of malicious 
statements to be such clear examples of defamation that you would not even 
have to prove that the proclamation was harmful. These automatic defamation 
statements generally include allegations of criminal conduct or statements con-
cerning a “loathsome disease,” such as a sexually transmitted disease or leprosy.
The Risks of a Defamation Lawsuit
Baltimore reputation management expert Henry Fawell points out one of 
the rarely considered hazards of protecting your image from online defamation. 
By filing a lawsuit, you are publicizing the allegations.
According to Fawell,
If someone has published defamatory information then your legal footing may 
be stronger, but that doesn’t necessarily mean filing suit is wise. Filing suit may 
draw more public attention to a statement that otherwise may have sunk into 
obscurity over time on search engines.
Consider the case of Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder. Snyder filed 
suit against the Washington City Paper in 2011 for what he deemed a libelous 
profile published by the paper. The profile was indeed mean spirited, but libel 
can be difficult to prove. From a public relations standpoint, the suit backfired. 
Before the suit, hardly anyone had heard about the profile. The City Paper is a 
tiny publication with a minuscule readership. When this tree fell, nobody heard 
it. By filing suit, however, the story dominated news in Washington for days. 
Snyder ensured that tens of thousands of Washingtonians—maybe hundreds 
of thousands—would read a profile they otherwise never knew existed. Once 
ESPN featured the story on the front page of its website, it was a national story 
with millions of readers.
The lesson? Before filing suit, consider all the public relations consequences.

Who Is a Celebrity Online?
It will be interesting to see over the next decade if the legal standards for 
proving defamation change because nearly everyone has an online persona, view-
able around the world, and may be considered, in some sense, to be a public 
figure. The televised Real Housewives and the kids from Jersey Shore are public 
figures. Mommy bloggers, Wikipedia subjects, and others with a large Internet 
following may be public figures.
What about those of us who have Facebook and Twitter accounts but who 
don’t cultivate celebrity? Will our newfound public images subject us to the same 
standards that now apply only to public figures? If a public figure is a person 
whose life is available for the world to see, then many teenagers with active 
Facebook pages qualify.
Challenges of Proving Defamation
One of the primary problems in fighting defamation on the Internet is the 
challenge of discovering who wrote the defamatory statement or Photoshopped 
a picture in a defamatory way. The law provides for civil suits against a “John 
Doe” whose name you don’t currently know but you intend to identify later. 
However, because one premise of U.S. litigation is that people have the right 
to defend themselves, judges will not let such a case proceed very far without a 
named defendant.
In addition, a defamation plaintiff needs certain companies to provide infor-
mation leading to identification of the “John Doe” being sued, and in most cases 
those companies will not simply hand over private information about their cus-
tomers. You’ll almost always need a discovery order from an official court case or 
a court subpoena to track down an information poster’s Internet service provider 
address. If the comments were posted anonymously from a public computer in 
a library, then you may never track down the person who made the defamatory 
comment. Legal process is simply inadequate in these cases.
A further complicating factor in online defamation cases is the international 
reach of the Internet. Although it is likely that most defamation cases will be 
filed against people who know each other and live in the same state or country, 
the Internet allows a person in far-off locations such as Australia, Ukraine, or 
India to easily post a defamatory statement about you. U.S. courts are not usually 
interested in adjudicating civil matters against foreign nationals, and even if you 
were to do so in a U.S. court, a civil judgment against a foreign national may not 
be enforceable in his or her home country.
Unfortunately, if you chose to seek your remedy overseas rather than in 
U.S. courts, maintaining a defamation case in any other jurisdiction would be 
prohibitively expensive and perhaps even impossible because the principals have 
to travel too far. Also, some countries have legal systems that are notoriously

PROTECTING IDENTITY IN A CRISIS
147
protective of their own citizens or simply so inefficient that cases can take 
decades to reach judgment.
There’s a Cost
Long before the age of the Internet, defamation cases were expensive and 
difficult to bring to trial. The famous sharpshooter Annie Oakley filed a series 
of cases against blatantly false stories in newspapers and won all of her cases but 
lost money in the process. Now that publications can be posted by anyone and 
be read by anyone with a computer or cell phone, the nature of the defamation 
case should probably be streamlined to accommodate the many people affected 
by online libel.
The barriers to publication of scurrilous lies have fallen considerably, but the 
barriers to addressing and refuting those claims under law are exactly the same as 
those Annie Oakley was forced to contend with at the turn of the last century. 
We can only hope that legislators will eventually correct this imbalance.
Contested defamation cases can cost tens of thousands of dollars in attor-
ney’s fees, so make sure the benefits of filing a lawsuit outweigh your costs. 
Defamation cases tend to be undertaken for resolution of reputation, and big 
damage awards are rare. And like many areas of litigation, wealthy defendants 
can drag your case out for a long time and drive expenses up. Conversely, a 
poorer defendant may not fight as hard but may also not be able to pay damages 
awarded against him.
Your Right to Control Your Own Image
Another area of the law that could be used to help clean up your online 
image is the law relating to rights of publicity. The right of publicity, where it is 
recognized, protects the rights of a person to control the commercial exploita-
tion of her name or image.
If you see a picture of yourself online, you might wonder if you have a legal 
right to force a company to take your picture off its website. Unfortunately, in 
the United States, the answer to that question is defined by the context of the 
situation—primarily by whether you are a celebrity with an economic interest 
in your image and whether the picture was offered as part of a commercial 
deal to make money for someone else or to show that you endorse a product 
or service.
Your rights with regard to a picture posted online will depend on the laws 
of the state you live in and the laws of the state or country where the picture was 
published. In most cases you are unlikely to have a legal right to force someone 
to stop using your image online unless you are a celebrity, the picture is being 
used for financial gain, or you live in certain states that have aggressively pro-
tected this right.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
148
There is no broad national law in this area. Some U.S. states, such as 
California, New York, and Indiana, have passed statutes protecting the right to 
profit from use of a person’s image or other aspect of personality as property. 
Other states, such as Georgia, have extensive case law that reaches a similar 
conclusion. Many states have neither.

Where rights exist, they tend toward recognizing commercial protections of 
a persona. However, with few exceptions, these rights would not come close to 
protecting the right of an individual to stop his or her picture from being used 
if taken in a public place and for a noncommercial purpose. If you live in the 
United States, even if you do not like the way your image is being used online, 
under current law you probably can’t sue the publisher of a true story, descrip-
tion, or accurate picture of you by claiming that the publisher violated your 
privacy. Rights of publicity for regular, non-celebrities simply do not stretch very 
far. We can only hope that, in the new online world where everybody has a pub-
lic persona, the law will eventually protect us better than the current mishmash 
of inconsistent state rules.

Branding Your Public Persona
J
ust as companies like McDonald’s and Apple have a public image, you have 
a public persona for all to see. And just like these companies, it’s to your 
benefit to be aware of your public image and to manage it. This concept is 
called branding, and in the Internet age, we all have one or more brands that 
represent us to the world. In this chapter we discuss how you can take control of 
your brand and make it work for you.
The Need for Branding
Developing your personal brand online has become so important that Syracuse 
University bought subscriptions to the Brand-Yourself.com platform in 2010 for 
all graduating seniors.1 The company was started by a group of former Syracuse 
students who noticed that some students do not get selected for internships or 
paid jobs because of their online persona. This service hopes to put the power 
back in your hands to manage what you look like to others online.
Graduating students were able to use the services, compliments of the uni-
versity, for six months. They could review their online persona by checking all 
of their social and professional networking profiles and making changes to them 
as needed.
In a Mashable.com article written as part of their “Real Results Series,” 
Mashable and a company called Gist analyzed how job seekers were finding jobs 
by building positive online personas and using social media. One person featured 
in this series was Kasey Fleisher Hickey.2 Hickey was active online, even main-
taining her own food and music blogs. A recruiter saw Hickey’s blog and was 
positively impressed by her posts and knowledge, so much so that Hickey was 
recommended for a job.
These are just two examples of the importance of online branding; still, 
when we discussed the concept of branding yourself online with people as we 
worked on this book, we received a variety of reactions that typically fell into 
one of two categories.
www.ebook3000.com

BRANDING YOUR PUBLIC PERSONA
151
•  Open Bookers: There is a group of people who claim that their lives are 
an open book, they have nothing to hide, and they will not waste their 
time worrying about their online image.
•  Deer in the Headlights: There is another set of people who are con-
cerned about their Internet personas but are somewhat immobilized. 
They feel as if their online image is out of their control, and they are 
therefore defeatist about changing it. If you feel this way, we have to 
acknowledge that a lot of the information posted about you is out of 
your control. You cannot control the tax records posted online. If you 
spoke at your kid’s PTO school meeting, they might post minutes with 
your protests about a new school schedule.
P e r s o n a s  a r o u n d  t h e  W o r l d
We’re not the only ones who think it’s important that you understand and 
control your online brand. Consider this: The New York Times reported that 
the European Union has created a campaign called “Think B4 U post!” 
cautioning people to think before they post about themselves and others. 
Also, France’s data protection commissioner, Alex Turk, has asked for legal 
protections that allow individuals to control their online persona, asking for 
a legal right to “oblivion.”
H o w  t h e  W o r l d  C a n  F i n d  Y o u
Type “LOL Facebook Moments” into a search engine, and you’ll see posts 
of those secrets that you, your friends, and strangers probably thought were 
private. You can also go to ReasonsToHate.com and see way too much 
personal information about marriages and relationships falling apart, new 
loves, and more. There is even an index to track any posts that mention “I 
hate . . . ,” “I love . . . ,” “My boss is . . . ,” and other topics. Because of the 
ability to unearth content about you online, you need to be careful, not just 
about making strong privacy settings but about what you post.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
152
No matter which category you fall into, if you need a reason to compel you 
to take control of your online image, consider this tragic story of a mom who 
discovered that someone had set up a fake profile for her son on Facebook. The 
kids who set up the profile hid behind her son’s good name to make racist and 
sexual comments. The fake profile was removed, but only after the Facebook 
account had more than five hundred friends. Many of the classmates who were 
friends to this bogus profile had no idea it was fake and assumed that the nasty 
posts were made by the boy whose name was in the profile. The boy and his 
mom are concerned that during college background and college sports team 
checks, these ugly posts, under his name, could have an impact on his ability 
to join a team or get into a college.3 So, if you hesitate to take control of your 
online brand for whatever reason, consider this: if this mother and son had not 
been vigilant and had not acted to take the bad content down, a bad situation 
would only have gotten worse.
How to Build Your Online Brand
So, how do you begin to create an online brand that will work for you? Your first 
step is to understand how impressions of you work and then create a strategy and 
plan to determine what brand you want to project.
Be Aware of Impressions
If you did your homework in chapter 4, you have some idea of what infor-
mation is out there about you. Take a look at that information now and consider 
your online activities. These can provide a positive or negative impact on how 
people see you, and could include the following:
•  clubs that you belong to
•  recent events you attended
•  political affiliations or events
•  your relationship status
•  your e-mail address and social media handles
•  your online connections to schools, universities, companies, organiza-
tions, and people
Try to analyze not only what content is online about you but also what 
impression your activities and comments are making on others.
Have a Brand Strategy
Having a strategy is a critical part of building your brand. You can make this 
strategy as simple or as complex as you like based on your needs and preferences. 
www.ebook3000.com

BRANDING YOUR PUBLIC PERSONA
153
Start by jotting down a few key words that relate to the picture you want people 
to have in mind when they look you up online.
Create a Mission Statement
Dr. Stephen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, 
suggests that you create a personal mission statement to define your life’s focus 
based on your purpose and moral compass. Your personal brand strategy should 
be a complete picture of your full persona that includes the parts of you that you 
want to show to people. A brand strategy could include your life goals matched 
to what you want others to see about you online.
For example, when our fictional Bob writes his personal mission statement, 
he wants to come across as an experienced lawyer but also to make sure that his 
online persona would be someone that prospective women would like to date 
and maybe even marry. Bob should monitor the tweets and posts he makes on 
social networking sites to portray that image. If he likes to cook or golf or bowl, 
he could join online affinity groups and post frequently. He might meet the 
woman of his dreams while they are both posting about the merits of bowling 
at the Sunshine Lanes.
Set Goals
Next, you need to set your goals and think about how your goals and the 
actions you take to achieve those goals will create your brand.
If you were Oprah Winfrey a few years ago, your online brand strategy 
might look something like this:
•  Goal: To host a dynamic and popular television show that drives view-
ers to a website that encourages them to watch the show.
H a p p i l y  E v e r  A f t e r ?
Relationships are particularly tricky. Note that marriage and divorce records 
are public, and many are available online. In addition, because many prop-
erty tax records are online, people can view those and make a guess at your 
relationship situation. Although you can’t remove those records, you can be 
consistent about keeping your relationships private by paying attention to 
what you mention in your online profiles and postings.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
154
•  Goal: Produce a fast-paced and modern magazine.
•  Goal: Make all who connect to the brand walk away feeling positive.
Have an Action Plan
After you have a branding strategy, before you start deleting or posting new 
items, take some time to think through and write up short bullet points or sen-
tences for the various parts of your brand.
For example, following our previous example of imaginary Oprah goals, the 
online branding extension of those goals might look like this:
•  TV Show Brand: Approachable and friendly, sitting and chatting 
among friends while millions watch.
•  Magazine Brand: Approachable and friendly, giving advice to friends, 
helpful and timely.
•  Overall Brand: No negative “gotcha” reporting, little focus on the sor-
did side of stories, “pay it forward” shows focused on compassion.
Here’s a sample to guide you on how to get started.
Professional Plan
Whether you’re delighted in your current job or, like Sally, you are still 
looking for your dream job, your career is an essential part of your Internet 
brand. It’s important to have a résumé, but it’s merely a starting point. To 
show what Sally is capable of, she could highlight recent projects, where 
appropriate, on her own blog or submit a case study paper to popular indus-
try blogs. In the digital age of texting and tweeting, you need to also have 
other entry points where people can see what you have to offer. Be sure to jot 
down and post professional information, such as your top three skills, career-
associated special interest groups, recent awards, attendance at conferences, 
and future goals. Note that chapter 9 discusses your professional brand in 
more detail.
Personal Plan
Your personal and professional life do blend on the Internet, whether you 
want them to or not, but your personal brand can be as important for you to 
work on as your professional brand. Some items that you may consider including 
in your personal profile are listed here:
•  Hobbies and interests outside of work
•  Favorite books, newspapers, or magazines
•  Recreational activities
www.ebook3000.com

BRANDING YOUR PUBLIC PERSONA
155
•  Favorite sports teams
•  Foodie, vacation spots, or art critiques
Here’s a rule of thumb to use for personal posts: every post or mention of 
an activity outside of work should be suitable for sharing with friends, family, 
coworkers, and strangers.
How to Promote Your Online Brand
Think about brands and household names that have the most positive image. 
What do the names Disney, Ritz-Carlton, or Johnson & Johnson suggest to 
you? When you say these names, you probably get a specific feeling. Disney 
offers wholesome entertainment, Ritz-Carlton may suggest luxury, whereas 
Johnson & Johnson constantly promotes itself as a safety-conscious, family-
oriented company. These companies have promoted a brand, and that same 
process can work for you.
If you come across at work as a capable professional who is focused, means 
business, and is a conscientious employee, congratulations! That is a great brand 
to own. But if, in your online life, you post negative comments about your job, 
you leave your boss, colleagues, and future employers to wonder which brand 
image is authentic.
In this section we have put together a step-by-step process that will help you 
manage your brand online, plan the content you should post, and decide where 
your brand should be located. This process is especially helpful if you are consid-
ering changing jobs, starting a business, have had a change in your personal life, 
or are a young adult getting ready for college or looking for work.
Own Your Name
A great way to manage what the search engines display about you is to own 
your own name on the Internet. Start by purchasing the domain name that 
matches your full name. There are several affordable options for doing this. 
As of this writing, some popular services you can use to purchase a Web URL 
include GoDaddy.com, 1and1.com, and Google.com.
You can also establish your name to set up blogging sites. Some popular 
blogging site options include Blogspot.com, TypePad.com, WordPress.com, 
Xanga.com, and LiveJournal.com. Even if you don’t plan to blog on a regular 
basis, you can post information there about you now and then to establish your 
brand.
One way to create good online karma for your name is to have a good profile 
on LinkedIn.com. LinkedIn.com typically hits the top of search engine results. 
Other professional networks that you may want to explore are XING.com,

156
NetworkingForProfessionals.com, and Ziggs.com. There may also be profes-
sional networks specific to your industry. Figure out which ones are the most 
reputable and set up a profile on them. You can also track your online reputation 
“score” by looking at services like Klout.com. Once you have a Klout profile, this 
service looks at information you have posted and your connections across social 
networks to rate your overall influence. Expect to see more free sites that help 
you manage your overall online persona.
Getting involved in social networks is another great way to claim your name 
and promote your personal and professional brand. These networks are typically 
free, and the more popular ones rank high in search engine results. This means 
that, if someone searches for your name and you have a LinkedIn account and 
other social networking accounts, your posts about yourself are most likely to rise 
to the top of search results.
Finally, consider owning your visual brand by creating and using a con-
sistent avatar. Avatars, which are essentially an animated version of you, help 
people identify a person or a brand consistently from blog posts to comments on 
news sites to Facebook posts. There is a free service at http://en.Gravatar.com 
that allows you to create an image and a profile that you can use on every site 
where you post information.
Start Your Branding
A 2013 New Yorker article, “You Are What You Tweet,” still rings true. 
Regardless of the social platforms you use, what you post, repost, like, and link 
to form your brand. The top three social media sites today, based on global traf-
fic and usage, are Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.4
You need to set up a Facebook account right away if you want a stronger 
online presence because this is currently the leading social networking site. 
When setting up your Facebook account, you should consider your brand, and 
you should use settings that protect you from identity thieves, cybercreeps, and 
cybercriminals.
Connect with others on Facebook. For example, if you are a website 
designer, then you may want to follow groups that talk about the latest in Web 
design, graphics, and styles. You can search for and follow or friend others in 
your profession. You can also post pictures of your work and pictures of you at 
various website design events or working on a client project. All of these actions 
project the image of a website designer who is creative, innovative, and con-
nected to others in the profession.
You could also become well thought of by posting helpful hints, ideas about 
tools you like to use, and even compliments on the work of others. As you build 
a following, you may find that people with whom you network online can lead 
you to jobs that you would not have learned about otherwise. In Mashable’s

article on how people are using their online persona and social networking to 
find jobs, David Cohen’s online persona and social networking helped David to 
find his dream job. He tried traditional methods with little success; then he saw 
a friend of a friend on Facebook who had just started a new Internet marketing 
agency. David didn’t know this person, but he took a chance and sent the agency 
director an instant message on Facebook. By having a positive online persona 
and using the social networking feature to reach out to someone, he was able to 
connect, get an interview with the company, and land a job.5
You may also create a Twitter account. Twitter allows you to create a profile 
and link people to any site of your choosing to learn more about you. Twitter 
positions you as an expert, whether related to hobbies or your professional skills. 
Tweeting can be a great way to connect to other people with your same interests 
or who work in your profession to share information and opinions.
You can also link your Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts so a post 
on one feeds to the others and you don’t have to do multiple postings.
Be proactive about your posts to establish yourself as a competent profes-
sional and someone others would want to befriend. You can send positive posts 
on the latest industry news or organizations that appeal to you. Consider making 
it a goal to post an idea each week that might be helpful to others in your profes-
sion, or use the post to ask other professionals for advice.
If you’re a student, also consider using your university sites. Sites for current 
students and alumnae are increasing in popularity and are a great way to show 
your professional interests and to highlight your current professional status.
Use Promotional Sites
Become visible on sites that help to push your brand. Sites that you can use 
to promote your brand include those listed here:
•  About.me, a site that will consolidate all of your social networking sites 
into one profile.
•  Flavors.me allows you to create a one-stop site that can include pho-
tos, your résumé, and interesting information about you.
•  Flickr.com is useful for photo sharing and staying in touch.
•  Tumblr.com is great for sharing anything from posts to music.
•  Reddit.com is a social bookmarking site that allows its user commu-
nity to post recommendations and news.
•  StumbleUpon.com is another social bookmarking site that allows 
people to share favorite links on the Web.
•  Plaxo.com allows you to bring your contacts together in one place 
across multiple Internet services and devices, whether they are from 
your phone, e-mail account, or social networking sites.

Choose Locations Deliberately
Once you figure out what you want to present as your brand image, you then 
need to decide on your brand placement. Just as Disney and Playboy advertise 
in certain venues that match their image, people should find you in all the right 
places online. You need to be where the action is on the high-traffic sites but 
also in locations consistent with the brand image that you want to portray.
Beyond social networking sites, you have an even greater opportunity to 
promote your brand by becoming a guest blogger on other sites, leaving posi-
tive and thoughtful posts on discussion boards, contributing to articles that are 
posted online, and looking for professional affiliations that might be interested 
in cross publishing your blog posts. Research the various locations where your 
brand should appear. If you are interested in gaming, then a gaming portal 
might be a perfect place for you to post comments with a link back to your blog. 
Keep aware of your personal and professional brand: If you love to game as a 
hobby but your profession is wealth management, think through whether post-
ing comments on a gaming site with links to your wealth management blog is a 
good fit. Based on your clientele, it might or might not be.
A fantastic resource for researching the latest trends in online social collabo-
ration and social networking is the group Mashable at Mashable.com. This site 
might give you some great ideas for what is appropriate for your brand location.
Maintain Your Persona
Now that you have a strategy for what you want your brand to look like and have 
started to post information on various websites, it’s time to think about the best 
way to maintain your persona.
You might want to commit to a time each day, week, or month when you 
will run through the steps for researching what information about you exists 
online, as covered in chapter 4.
If you need some help keeping track of the content that you post, in this sec-
tion we propose three options that will help you maintain your chosen persona.
Set up Automated Alerts
An automated alert is a handy feature that you can set up on many accounts 
to alert you to changes. For example, you can create an alert that sends you an 
e-mail message every time someone posts your name on the Internet.
Some popular alert services are as follows:
•  Google Alerts provides a service to track postings about a topic you 
care about, track online mentions of your favorite sports team, or to 
track occurrences of your name or your loved ones’ names online. Visit 
www.ebook3000.com

BRANDING YOUR PUBLIC PERSONA
159
www.google.com/alerts to use the simple interface for setting up and 
managing alerts. You can set up your alerts to arrive at a time interval 
that works best for you. Yahoo! offers a similar service at http://alerts 
.yahoo.com.
•  Blog alerts are a great way to help you moderate comments to protect 
your blog’s image. For example, you may find that there is one person 
out there who likes to post inappropriate comments. Blog alerts let 
you know that someone has left a comment, allowing you to approve 
it before it goes online. There are various blog alert tools, but one we 
like is Technorati. You can set up your blog on their site and ask to 
be notified if your name or blog posts are referenced anywhere online.
Check and Aggregate
Set up a time on your calendar to regularly check on each of your various 
websites, links, and social networks to see what might have been posted there. 
In addition, choose tools to help you aggregate and search for any posts about 
you. One tool for this is Plaxo, which we mentioned previously in this chapter; 
another useful tool is Memotoo. Memotoo syncs your phones, tablets, and larger 
computers so that changing a contact in one device is mirrored in all the others. 
It also allows you to sync your devices with social networks and accounts held 
on websites.
Be Active
You need to keep your information current. Many of us do not have the 
time to post something to a blog every day or to send Facebook posts and tweets 
that are intelligent and improve our brand. If you post every day without a plan, 
you might post things in haste that you will regret later.
Fortunately, there is an easy way to keep your online brand up to date. You 
can install many of the major social networking applications on your smartphone 
and use those times when waiting for a train or an appointment to post an image 
or comment to one of your accounts.
Use Fee-Based Services
Though the steps we listed here are simple, you have to find time in your 
busy day to do the maintenance and set up the alerts. If you find yourself in a 
time crunch, or you believe a loved one will not do this for his or her Internet 
persona, there are various reputation management services out there that you 
can use, for a fee.
Some popular fee-based services include Reputation.com, Defendmyname, 
and Naymz. They offer services and pricing plans that are based on how much 
you want them to handle for you and what actions you want them to take on

your behalf. We recommend that you do research to stay abreast of the latest 
services available. We also recommend that you do comparison shopping before 
you sign a contract and, if possible, sign up for a trial period before you commit. 
If you’re interested in such services, chapter 5 provides a little more insight into 
Reputation.com.
Back up Branding with Commonsense Behavior
There are some behavioral rules that are always good to follow if you want to 
have success with your online image, so in this last section we provide you with 
a few rules to live by.
Don’t Let Emotions Rule
Traditionally, you could have a public life and a private life. Things are dif-
ferent in the Internet age. Your private persona tends to bleed into your public 
persona. Just assume, no matter what you think a Web service privacy statement 
says, that someday others will see that post, transaction, or information about 
you. During an emotional moment, one of extreme happiness, anger, or sadness, 
you may post something that you regret later. If you have an extreme emotion, 
sleep on the news or event before posting about it on the Internet.
Avoid Mistaken Identity
Watch out for mistaken identity on the Internet. There might be many 
other “Mary Smiths” online whose behavior doesn’t match your desired image. 
Consider using a middle name or initial across your sites to help minimize the 
chance of mistaken identity. Posting an avatar or profile picture consistently 
across sites is helpful in avoiding confusion with others.
Practice Internet Persona Hygiene
Even when you’re careful, you might post something you regret. Maybe you 
have an embarrassing typo in your post. Maybe you slammed the horrible service 
you received and you regret your tone and word choices. Even if you delete those 
embarrassing posts, sometimes made during lapses of judgment, they can come 
back to haunt you.
If you want to delete posts, read the help or frequently asked questions sec-
tion for the site. Some sites provide a method for deleting content. However, 
keep in mind that trails and remnants of those posts may be in other locations on 
the Internet or copied over to somebody else’s computer, so it may be impossible 
to permanently delete anything posted online.
There are also services out there that can help you to prevent a social or 
professional faux pas. Google mail has a setting called “Undo Send” that helps 
www.ebook3000.com

you retrieve an e-mail if you have second thoughts within a certain time period. 
The Google mail default is to send your e-mail within ten seconds of clicking 
Send, but you can change the timer setting for this.
When the Post Isn’t Yours
If you know the person, the first logical step may be to request that he or 
she remove the content voluntarily. If that doesn’t work, most websites give you 
the option of contacting them about erroneous posts that they may then remove 
from their sites.
In the event that the posts about you are clearly defamatory, you can take 
legal action, but this is not an easy route (see chapter 6 for more about this). In 
one such case, a fashion designer said her reputation was ruined, causing emo-
tional and financial damages when Courtney Love posted negative comments 
about her. She sued Courtney Love and won the libel lawsuit. The posts have 
since been removed, but it was a long and costly process to resolve the case.6
The Short List of Online “Don’ts”
Here’s a quick checklist of things you should never do online:
1.  Blast an employer
2.  Complain about boredom or lack of motivation at work
3.  Complain about your spouse or loved one
4.  Post pictures or information about friends and family without their 
permission
5.  Get into emotionally charged arguments on social media
6.  Use a fake name to post negative comments

media in Edelman’s Washington, D.C., office. David graciously offered his 
perspective for this book.
In a crowded, rapidly evolving modern marketplace, it is becoming increasingly 
more important to tell our own story and, thanks to the exponential growth of the 
Internet and social media, we have more channels than ever to do so. However, 
content that comprises one’s online presence must be actively maintained in order 
to effectively achieve desired outcomes.
Some refer to this process as managing a “digital footprint,” which refers to 
how we are represented online and consists of two primary parts: online content 
on websites, blogs, and social media published by you; and content posted about 
you by others which you can’t control, but you may be able to influence. The sum 
of these is organized by algorithmic relevance via search engines. In other words, 
if you publish nothing about yourself online, then you cede total control of your 
online reputation to others and Google will determine which content rises to the 
top based on clicks, relevance, timeliness, and engagement, among other factors.
As White House Internet Director for President George W. Bush, one of my 
favorite projects was “Ask the White House,” a weekly online interactive Q&A 
forum hosted on WhiteHouse.gov. In addition to the value of connecting citizens 
with Bush Administration officials via the website, the content that was generated 
during the conversation assisted in clarifying complex policy positions and opti-
mized organic search results for both the guest and the issue long after the chat 
had been completed.
The first step in taking control of your online presence is to commit to it. These 
days, anyone with a mobile device can snap photos, tweet, post status updates, or 
upload video on the fly. I suggest mapping out a content strategy to ensure that 
anything published online is not only timely and relevant to your audience, but 
also aligns with the image you hope to project and the brand you wish to build. 
For example, I usually publish content that falls into four basic categories: media/
public relations trends, politics, personal life events/interests (travel, family activi-
ties, sports), and audience engagement/miscellaneous. For me, this mix generally 
breaks down to 30–30–30–10, but I encourage you to find the category ratio that 
best fits your interests.
Next, identify a few digital channels to host and manage your content. Whether 
it’s a blog or an official website, owning an online outlet is essential. This is a place 
where you control all the content and can provide unique first person perspective. 
When writing for the Web, be concise. It only takes a few minutes to type up a 
couple of paragraphs to describe an event. Stick with the basics of what we all 
learned in Journalism 101 by answering who, what, when, where, why, and how.
When possible, include multimedia to add a little color. Visual content such as 
photos and video are always a plus. They add context to the story and increase the 
chances that your posts will be seen. Several studies have shown that posts with 
visual content such as photos and video consistently increase engagement rates such

as clicks, likes, comments, and shares. When posting, choose relevant titles that 
accurately describe the event along with specific keywords for your images, photo 
sets, and video so that others can find them more easily when searching.
Be sure to leverage some of the more popular social media sites and networks 
that are available to you. When setting up accounts, consider reserving consistent 
usernames. Of course, Facebook and Twitter are among the largest of these social 
communities, but there are many more to explore such as YouTube and Vimeo 
for video, Flickr and Instagram for photos, Path for personal networks, LinkedIn 
for career development and networking, Foursquare for location-based event 
“check-ins,” and one of the newest contenders to the social space, Snapchat. Many 
of these tools are free and offer quick and easy upload and embed features which 
allow for optimal online sharing. Don’t be shy about cross-promoting across chan-
nels; everyone consumes information differently.
Publishing content is just the first step. By building an active and engaged 
online community, you will increase the chances that your content will be seen and 
shared. Remember, the Web is a social medium, so it is important to listen to your 
community when they engage with you. Respond to their posts in a timely man-
ner and be sure to share their content in your channels from time to time, as well. 
In general, try to publish regularly and offer a variety of posts such as short status 
updates, links to blog entries, photos, news items, video, trivia, etc.
Indeed, the power of social media is changing how we all connect and com-
municate. Taking advantage of these online tools will enhance your ability to 
successfully manage your digital footprint while simultaneously allowing you to 
positively affect your search results, engage with interested audiences, and build 
online community.

Chapter 8
Your Right to Be Forgotten 
and to Complain Online
A
s the Internet evolves, laws and regulations are also changing to reflect 
societal issues and problems created by new types of behavior taking 
place online. Never before has the world had access to statements, 
pictures, video, and criticism by millions of individuals who are otherwise not 
celebrities. The Internet provides us with places to document our lives, thoughts, 
and preferences online and then holds that material for an indefinite period of 
time, long after we might have outgrown our own postings. It also provides 
places where we can criticize our bosses, local building contractors, or polluters. 
This chapter describes some of the new and evolving law around how to manage 
and protect our rights in regard to new Internet information and opportunities.
Children Are Different
Criminal law in the United States treats children differently than adults. In most 
cases, a fourteen-year-old boy who commits a serious crime is likely to be sent 
to a juvenile facility with other teenagers, rather than to prison. The period of 
incarceration for children who commit crimes tends to be substantially less than 
adults who commit similar crimes. And most relevant to this book, juvenile 
records are generally sealed from the public, whereas adult conviction records 
are public and often searchable online.
Nearly all countries in Europe and the English-speaking world punish 
crimes differently if committed by children. These societies believe that mistakes 
made in childhood should not necessarily be available in public records when 
they become adults. Social science research has shown us that the adolescent 
brain is more prone to risk-taking and poor judgment than a fully developed 
adult brain. Teenagers are simply more likely to act impulsively, to jump into 
dangerous situations, and to ignore society’s rules when doing so. Modern 
societies recognize these facts and shield adults from many of the impulsive or 
thoughtless actions of their childhood. If someone at your workplace committed 
a crime as a teenager, you probably won’t know about it.

California’s Eraser Law
Recently, the State of California extended this practice to hiding the embar-
rassing content that California teens post on social media. As described previ-
ously, social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram are built on the 
piles of past information posted onto millions of websites. Traditionally, they 
have not allowed users to remove much historical data from their sites. However, 
things have changed: As of January 1, 2015, a social networking website must 
allow California teenagers who are registered users of the website to remove 
material that they posted on the website. This policy guarantees California teens 
the ability to erase the worst and most embarrassing items they posted on social 
media before those items are discovered by jobsite hiring managers, college 
admissions officers, or prospective in-laws.
This California Eraser Law is not a privacy panacea. It only affects certain 
websites, it only protects teenagers residing in the state, and it limits its protec-
tion to items that a teenager posts himself or herself. This law does not provide 
a right to remove humiliating pictures that classmates may have posted of the 
teen attending a costume party or caught making an unfortunate dance move at 
F e a t u r e d  T o o l :  S n a p c h a t
An early driver of the now pervasive selfie phenomenon, Snapchat appeared 
in 2011 as a tool called Peekaboo. A user sent a picture that lasted from 
one second to ten seconds and then was supposed to disappear forever. This 
platform encouraged shared photographs of all types, because the sharing 
was immediate but the history was brief. By October 2013, Snapchat was 
processing 350 million “snaps” per day.
Scandals followed when people realized that not all snaps were disap-
pearing as promised and when hackers compromised the tool. But by 2014, 
Snapchat was already evolving into less of an intimate sharing site and more 
of a marketing platform, offering text and video options, along with filters 
and watermark logos on snaps. Advertising appeared, and Snapchat released 
a Discover option that allows publishers to upload content to the service. 
Snapchat is also measuring popularity of public snaps.
The short history of social media is a constant resource for businesses 
learning to “milk the herd.” A company like Snapchat builds an audience 
by providing interesting tools and then finds ways to make money from the 
crowd it has attracted, thereby evolving into a different type of site.

a club. If the most embarrassing items on a young person’s social media page are 
posted by others, then nothing can be done to force removal. The embarrassed 
person will simply need to ask others to remove data on his or her behalf.
Other U.S. legislatures have been less eager to provide an eraser right to 
their citizens, children or otherwise. Although the concept has been raised in 
the U.S. Congress and in some states, no additional protections seem likely to 
pass. In Canada, a court in British Columbia has addressed issues of requests to 
remove search links and left the door open to consider a right to be forgotten, 
similar to one available in the European Union.
The need for protection from online teenage mistakes may be less pressing 
than it once was. Where young people once conducted all of their lives over 
accessible social media, now tech-savvy teens are using new tools like Snapchat, 
Whisper, and Yik-Yak that make it harder to save and trace pictures and mes-
sages. They are also registering at Tumbler and JournalSpace under pseudonyms 
and Internet handles that cannot be easily traced to the author. According to 
the Washington Post, “College admissions officers increasingly struggle to find 
Internet dirt on their applicants. The percentage of those officers who say social 
media has negatively impacted someone’s chances has fallen, in the past two 
years, from 35 to 16 percent.”1 Today many people are using anonymizing tools 
to separate the information they post for public consumption from information 
that could be embarrassing.
Being Forgotten around the World
This right to be forgotten originated beyond U.S. borders. Around the world, 
legislators and policymakers have been looking closely at this issue. But when 
one jurisdiction wants to grant its citizens the right to be forgotten, it must 
police the entire Internet. U.S. Internet companies are currently spending mil-
lions addressing the problems of applying one country or region’s laws to the 
global world of the Internet.
The Right to Be Forgotten in the European Union
A Spanish man named Mario Costeja González fell into debt early in 
his life and his home was repossessed to pay the debt. A newspaper called La 
Vanguardia printed a thirty-six-word article in 1998 describing this reposses-
sion. González was upset to find that when he looked up his own name on the 
search engine Google, this article was a prominent link on the search page. He 
requested removal of the article by complaining to the Spanish Data Protection 
Agency and his request was denied because the article was a true reporting of 
facts. However, the agency granted his request that Google remove its search 
engine link to the article.

Google sought to overturn the decision, but the European Court of Jus-
tice held that a right to be forgotten was a core privacy right for citizens in 
the European Union. Google must remove links to past information when 
requested by European citizens, even where the link was to undisputedly true 
information included in newspaper articles. France’s Commission Nationale de 
l’Informatique et des Libertés ruled that Google must remove such links on “all 
domain names” of the search engine, not only from searches on the European 
versions of Google, but also on the North American sites. Google fought this 
order, claiming that the French Commission has no right to expand the scope 
of the European Court of Justice’s original opinion, but its appeal was rejected.
Now a European citizen who committed a crime or embarrassing act can 
have the links to news stories and other online references removed from Google 
searches for that person’s name. In applying the right to be forgotten on Google, 
the courts first found that Google processes data as it proposes search results. 
Because Google uses a sophisticated algorithm that ranks websites and refer-
ences in relation to each other, the court felt that Google had responsibility for 
the placement of some of those links and references. If a citizen of the European 
Union felt that a particular search result violated his privacy, then the court 
would order Google to evaluate and respect his or her request.
This book describes a number of methods to remove, mask, or minimize 
problematic information about you that exists online. If you are a citizen of 
one of the countries of the European Union, then you may have an additional 
option. Google provides a form on its website titled “Search removal request 
under data protection law in Europe.” The form, available now in twenty-five 
languages, asks a user to select the country whose law applies to the request. If 
the user chooses one of the protective European Union nations, then Google 
allows submission of the URL for the results that the user wants removed for 
searches on his or her name. The user or a legal representative must sign the 
form. 
Google doesn’t promise to remove the information right away, or at all, 
but it evaluates the requests under the standards set by the European Court of 
Justice. If Google grants a request to remove a link under this regime, it sends a 
notice to the site that published the article that may be unlinked, so that repre-
sentatives of that site can argue for keeping the link in the search result. Google 
weighs the arguments of both sides before deciding whether it will ultimately 
remove the link. A successful application will not lead to removal of the under-
lying article or website, but only to remove links to that article or website when 
somebody searches for the person in question.
Of course, not all requests are granted. For example, Google tends to 
leave active links to news items about public figures. But for a large portion of 
the European population, the right to be forgotten provides the clearest and

most certain path to removing embarrassing information from personal name 
searches.
Source of International Conflict
This European ruling highlights one of the most significant cultural differ-
ences among advanced societies in today’s world. The United States extols free-
dom of speech and freedom of the press as its highest values. In this view, society 
is better served by allowing all true information to be available, even if exposing 
some of that information is uncomfortable to certain individuals or groups. In 
the view of the European Union as expressed in proposed guiding principles as 
well as by the European Court of Justice, personal privacy is the dominant value 
and society should protect personal privacy even if it interferes with freedom 
of expression in doing so. In other words, in the United States, policy makers 
believe that future lenders, employers, and personal contacts should have a right 
to know about financial or legal transgressions in the past, whereas EU policy 
makers would rather protect a person’s privacy despite the fact that masked 
information may be valuable to someone in the future.
These different perspectives also demonstrate one of the most significant 
Internet issues that remains to be decided: To what degree can the Internet rules 
of one country override the opposing rules held by another country? Because the 
Internet crosses all national boundaries, online behavior in one nation can easily 
cross over into another. Right to be forgotten cases have created a significant 
controversy over whether one country may impose its values on other countries. 
Can France truly dictate what Google does on its U.S.-based Google.com web-
site, operated and regulated out of the United States but accessible all over the 
world? 
A dictatorship might simply set up walls to keep the offending Google site 
from appearing in their territory, but an open nation like France is unwilling 
to do so. Will the United States file a protest against its ally for attempting to 
impose French law on a U.S. company? The conflict lines are drawn, but no 
conclusions have been reached.
Countries outside the European Union have not recognized a right to be 
forgotten. As the Internet grows and evolves, and as the volume of data about 
each of us increases, we are likely to see more variations of this concept, and 
more people who will be allowed to appeal to their country’s laws to force com-
panies to remove accurate information from the Web.
Not all European Union countries have agreed that the EU Charter pro-
vides a right to be forgotten. In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a 
House of Lords Sub-Committee on EU affairs officially recommended that 
the UK government must advocate against any provision ensuring a “right to 
be forgotten” or a “right to erasure” in any updated EU privacy regulations.

Chairman of the Sub-Committee, Baroness Prashar, stated that the judgment 
of the European Court of Justice is unworkable because it forces search engine 
companies to decide whether to delete requested information from searches. It 
also does not take into account the fact that smaller search engines don’t have 
the resources to constantly respond to removal requests. In addition, Prashar 
said, “We do not believe that individuals should be able to have links to accurate 
and lawfully available information about them removed, simply because they do 
not like what is said.”
Right to Be Forgotten, American Style
Given the general preference in the United States to elevate freedom of 
expression above the concepts of embarrassment or humiliation, it is unlikely 
that the United States would adopt policies similar to the European Union’s 
right to be forgotten. Without the force of law, adults living in the United 
States will need to find other ways to make Internet embarrassments disappear. 
Although many true stories or facts from your past may be indelibly written onto

Through his lawsuit, Costeja González significantly changed the world’s 
treatment of Internet search and established the first enforced right to be 
forgotten. Ironically, the push to remove thirty-six words in one article has 
led to more than eight hundred articles* featuring his case. Rather than 
being forgotten, Sr. Costeja González has become famous and his entire 
story is regularly repeated on all forms of media. This fame is evidence of an 
Internet phenomenon known as the “Streisand effect,” in which a person’s 
effort to remove information from the Internet draws attention to that in-
formation and leads to the opposite result than the party seeking to remove 
the information intended. This effect is named after entertainer Barbra 
Streisand, who attempted to squelch photographs of her home and drew 
greater attention to the same photographs.

the Internet, there are several strategies that may help you to remove or reduce 
the importance of the most frustrating content.
For example, most social media sites already allow you to request removal 
of the items that you have posted on your own page. Facebook claims that it 
will always allow people to delete the content they create. Ellen Schrage, Face-
book’s vice-president of communications and public policy, is quoted in The 
New Yorker as saying, “If you put up a photo or a post, you always get to take it 
down.”2 Facebook also offers a way to mark certain posts or photos as offensive 
to you because they are pornographic, annoying, or because you oppose the 
subject matter of the post. If you note your displeasure with a post, Facebook, 
at its discretion, may bring the post down. The same type of complaint system 
is available for nearly every major social networking site, and the site will con-
sider removing specific submissions if you find them to be offensive, obscene, or 
bullying. So you can remove your own postings, and you have a good chance of 
removing the social media postings about you if you have a strong enough reason 
for requesting their removal.
Other types of sites may not be as open to removal of data. Newspapers tend 
to only be responsive to complaints about the accuracy of their stories. News-
oriented websites will not usually pull a regular news or feature story down from 
the Web just because you find the news story to be embarrassing or otherwise 
offensive. However, the interactive nature of the Internet leads to news sites that 
include not only the content developed by the news organization, but also con-
tent provided by online readers. Reader-generated content is more susceptible 
to being pulled down from the site upon complaint. For example, the New York 
Times, in its online terms of service document, states that it “encourages active 
discussions and welcomes heated debate on the Services, but personal attacks are 
a direct violation of these Terms of Service and are grounds for immediate and 
permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service.” If you feel that a 
response to one of your comments is abusive or overly personal, you can ask the 
editors to remove it from the comments section, and they are likely to comply.
This type of policy is the same for nearly all sites that encourage civilized 
discourse and discussion around a topic, from sports websites to online retailers 
that allow visitor reviews of products. Amazon.com encourages visitors to post 
reviews and even photographs and other visual content, but if this content vio-
lates Amazon’s rules, the retailer reserves the right to edit or remove such con-
tent, including content that will “cause injury to any person or entity.” If you feel 
that a post injures you in any way, Amazon has a complaint system to address 
these concerns, and will consider removing the offending content. CBS Sports’ 
website includes similar rules and rights in its terms of use, as do many others.
The Internet contains a universe of stories, comments, pictures, and other 
information, some developed professionally, and some written or added off the 
www.ebook3000.com

YOUR RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN AND TO COMPLAIN ONLINE
171
cuff by viewers and browsers like you. If you find personal attacks or informa-
tion among this content embarrassing, you can always ask the site to remove the 
offending content. The site may or may not do so, depending on your reasons 
for asking and depending on who posted the problem. This is as close as most 
adult citizens of the United States are likely to come to a right to be forgotten.
U.S. Legal Protections for Online Criticism
Although the United States may never provide a broad right to be forgotten, 
it still has laws protecting your Internet identity. For instance, many of us use 
Internet forums and comment sections to state facts or opinions on topics that 
are important to us. Sometimes these statements are made anonymously using 
an Internet pseudonym, and sometimes they are made using our real names. 
Either way, depending on the state where you live, you can access legal protec-
tions for stating your opinion online. 
Defending Free Speech
The United States is so committed to free speech that, not only does the 
U.S. Constitution protect free speech from government interference, but most 
states have laws that protect speakers from certain private law suits aimed at 
shutting down criticism. Those laws are being applied by those who post on the 
Internet and by websites to prevent lawsuits from people and companies who 
feel that certain online statements about them crossed the line into defamation.
Known as anti-SLAPP laws (SLAPP stands for “Strategic Lawsuits 
Against Public Participation”), thirty states have legislative or judicial protec-
tions against lawsuits filed to quiet legitimate public criticism. Varying in degree 
and method of protection, the various anti-SLAPP laws are intended to protect 
legitimate protests by citizen groups and individuals against corporations or 
other wealthy, powerful entities that would file expensive lawsuits against them. 
State legislatures acted so that the rich and powerful could not silence dissent by 
bankrupting the dissenters. 
A good example is a California case in which a nonprofit community hos-
pital planned to build a for-profit hospital, and a public interest lawyer who 
opposed the action. The lawyer wrote a letter to the state attorney general ask-
ing for an investigation of the hospital’s tax-exempt status because of alleged 
profit-making interests of the hospital’s board chairman. That hospital chairman 
sued the lawyer for defamation and for unfair business practices. The trial court 
agreed that this lawsuit was brought to silence the apparently valid criticism of 
the public interest lawyer and granted an anti-SLAPP motion against the hospi-
tal chairman, dismissing his complaint. The ruling was affirmed on appeal, and 
the lawyer was granted an award of his attorney’s fees and costs in the action.3

Anti-SLAPP Goes Online
Anti-SLAPP rules have gained new life through the Internet, particularly 
in the realm of online reviews. Many people, from doctors and professors to the 
owners of restaurants and home repair businesses have sued to silence negative 
online reviews. The primary tool for this is the defamation lawsuit, but those 
offended by harsh and hurtful online statements have also used other laws such 
as copyright and unfair trade practices to push back against their critics. Some 
of those critics and, in some instances, the website companies that hosted the 
online reviews, have invoked anti-SLAPP rules, claiming that the doctor or 
restaurateur was using the lawsuit to punish legitimate criticism and make the 
critics spend money defending themselves.
For example, in the case of Ampex Corporation v. Cargle,4 a publicly traded 
company sued anonymous posters on Yahoo! message boards for saying nega-
tive things about the company and its management. According to the court 
opinion, the posters claimed to be former Ampex employees and published 
long rants against company management and poor decision making, culmi-
nating in statements like, “All in all, it was the most miserable, sleazy, cheap 
operation I have ever worked for,” and “It was total incompetence. It was a 
bunch of old guys sitting around trying to make money with a new media that 
they didn’t understand.” Ampex filed a libel suit against the anonymous posters 
and worked to discover their identities. The defendants filed an anti-SLAPP 
motion in the California court, claiming that the lawsuit was simply a tool 
to punish them for exercising their free speech rights to criticize their former 
employer.5 
Using the court case to find the name of the anonymous posters, Ampex 
promptly dropped the California lawsuit and filed another one in New York. 
The California court then dismissed the anti-SLAPP motion, too, but the 
California Court of Appeals overruled that decision, finding that the plaintiffs 
filed a lawsuit in California for improper reasons and making the company pay 
the Internet forum posters’ costs and attorney fees. This case illustrates the fact 
that though powerful interests may care deeply what individuals say about them 
online, many state laws exist to protect people from harassing law suits aimed at 
shutting down criticism. 
In 2015 an anti-SLAPP law called the Speak Free Act was introduced into 
the U.S. Congress, but it has not passed congressional votes as of this publica-
tion. Introduction of this bill was encouraged by the lobbying arm of Yelp, the 
website that hosts reviews of everything from restaurants to roofers. In an article 
in Mother Jones magazine, Yelp spokesperson Lauren Crenshaw said, “This 
issue is really one that hits close to the heart for Yelp.”6 Like Yelp, the various 
media companies that provide sites for public commentary and complaints have 
a vested interest in protecting open and honest feedback about everything from

173
local businesses to sports figures and politicians. An entire economy has grown 
around those comments on the Internet, and the anti-SLAPP laws can be used 
to protect people participating in that economy.

Dress for Career Success
Y
our friends and family are accustomed to seeing you in casual clothes, 
but when you need to impress your boss or a new business client, you 
probably dress more formally. When we are young our online persona 
is generally more casual. Growing into adulthood most people need a greater 
focus on professional image. Revising your online image to impress prospective 
business clients or employers can help you harness the Internet as a vital tool for 
maximizing your career success and earning potential.
Many prospective customers and professional contacts will receive their first 
impression of you on the Internet. By carefully crafting Internet information, 
you can build a solid professional persona online and impress people with your 
acumen and expertise long before they ever shake your hand in person.
A Professional Strategy Builds Value Online
The first step in creating a productive professional persona is deciding that 
you want to either build a business image around your own personal image or 
to build a professional image that is distinct from your casual, personal online 
image. Some professionals wrap their personality into their profession and allow 
potential clients to learn important facts about them. Others display a profes-
sional image online and hide their personal information behind “friend” walls 
and privacy screens. Either strategy can pay off handsomely if you execute it well 
and the image that you create supports what you have to sell.
We asked Adrian Dayton, a social media business consultant from Amherst, 
New York, about the best strategies for building a professional persona online, 
and he said, “For the past 100 years we have had a clear line separating out our 
personal from professional life. This line is really starting to blur and frankly I 
think it’s a great thing. People do business with people they know, like and trust. 
Letting people really see more of your personality and what you’re like outside of 
work can really increase the chances of you getting hired. Don’t overdo it however, 
but also don’t be afraid to share more about your passions, interests and hobbies.”

Dayton makes a living helping legal and business consultants build their 
brands, and in those businesses, incorporating personal data into a professional 
online persona makes a great deal of sense. 
However, for many roles, like engineer, plumber, or research scientist, it 
may not be as important to know about a person’s off-the-job personality. Pro-
spective customers and employers would be impressed with a deep résumé, but 
not care much about the personal aspects of an online persona.
If you are concerned about combining the two, you can easily meld together 
your personal Internet image and your professional persona, but to do so, you 
should emphasize online those personal facts that support your professional 
expertise. Your Internet image should minimize the aspects of your personal life 
that are unrelated to business or that might reflect poorly on your character or 
abilities in your professional role. Postings of words or pictures that show you 
in moments of personal weakness may be fun to share with your friends, but 
those pictures could lose you business opportunities. Raving passionately about 
all of life’s minor inconveniences on Twitter or exploring the intricacies of your 
failures in love and relationships on your Tumblr account may feel therapeutic 
but are likely to turn off people who look to you for professional advice. 
Similarly, although you have a constitutional right in the United States to 
speak your mind on nearly every topic, taking aggressive positions on political or 
social issues is likely to turn away prospective customers. Even being an overly 
enthusiastic sports fan can hinder your professional relationships. Hardly any-
one will mind if you are a vocal supporter of your hometown team or your alma 
mater. However, potential clients from Boston are likely to stay away if you are 
constantly belittling the Red Sox online, and abusive language, even in fun, can 
drive off potential customers.
A Winning Professional Persona
To understand what a successful online professional image can look like, take 
the example of management consultant David Allen of Ojai, California. He has 
built a brilliant online professional image that makes use of a personal brand 
combined with a brand plucked from his management philosophy.
How has he done this? Start with his name. The name “David Allen” is 
common, and you would think it might be difficult to create a brand around 
it, but this consultant has done it, and done it well. He has developed his own 
company called David Allen Company and has a website at www.Davidco.com. 
His site has been optimized for search engines so he can be easily found.
Although there are thousands of David Allens, when we first typed his 
name into Google, the Getting Things Done website was the first item listed, 
and nearly the entire first Google search screen was filled with links related 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
176
to this consultant, including purchase pages for his books and images of him. 
Google also included a box describing the consultant with several pictures, a 
short biography, and pictures of the books Mr. Allen had authored. Other David 
Allens, such as famous actors, movie producers, musicians, comedians, painters, 
and sportsmen, were relegated to later pages.
Allen’s consultancy has a professional website that serves as the center for 
all the other spokes in his wheel. The front page of the Allen website is concise, 
regularly updated, and easy to understand, and it links to a number of pages 
demonstrating the depth of Allen’s philosophy and marketing strategy. These 
links not help to explore his own site, but link to other websites that sell Allen’s 
books or attest to his skill and experience.
As well-crafted as his website is, it is not the only way he leverages the 
Internet. Much of Allen’s most impressive uses of the Internet to create and 
support his personal brand and his “Getting Things Done” brand occur as 
supplemental uses of media. Allen writes a special GTD blog (at the branded 
site Gtd-times.com) to frequently update advice to people who want to hear 
more about “Getting Things Done,” and he also publishes a blog on Huffington 
Post that links back to his own site. There is a Getting Things Done official 
Facebook page that links back to www.Davidco.com and to www.Gtd-times 
.com. There is also a Getting Things Done site on LinkedIn.com for network-
ing with the business community. Allen’s company provides a Twitter feed with 
short messages coming out often to update and highlight the GTD philosophy. 
There is even a Wikipedia page about Allen that also links to his websites. All of

You have probably heard of Twitter, and you may wonder how a website 
where people broadcast short messages about the content of their breakfasts 
and the difficulty of highway traffic can be useful for business. Keep in mind 
that Twitter is a tool, and a tool is only as effective as the person using it.
Twitter, conceived as a “microblog,” has been recognized as one of the 
top ten most-visited websites by a well-regarded rating service.* Twitter is 
a social media service that provides each user with an account to publish an 
unlimited number of messages, none more than 140 characters in length. 
Given that the previous sentence was 153 characters in length, you can

177
see how limiting the site rules are. Why 140 characters? Twitter founders 
wanted to take advantage of the Short Message Service (SMS) text feature 
available on many mobile phones at the time, and that service limits mobile 
messaging to 140 characters. Twitter also allows links to websites and photos 
to be sent over the service.
However, there can be magic in brevity. The tight word restriction on 
Twitter forces many Twitter users to pack their “tweets” with information, 
humor, and attitude.
On Twitter you can develop a group of followers who will receive the 
140 character messages you send out. If you are writing about the personal 
details of your life and the tedium of your day, it is likely that only your 
friends and family will “follow” your tweets. However, if you establish yourself 
as an expert in a particular professional topic, then Twitter is an excellent tool 
to send your insights and new research to a worldwide group of people who 
are interested in the same topic. Twitter can be an effective tool for drawing 
prospective business clients toward you and for establishing your areas of 
professional interest. As you follow other Twitter users, you can build a net-
work of people who are interested in the same professional topics as you are 
and who might refer work to you or teach you more about your chosen topic.
If you regularly post to Twitter, you can easily link those posts to your own 
website or use an application to post your tweets on your site. Many people 
building an online professional persona link their social media pages to their 
Twitter feed and then tie them all to the site that fully describes their com-
mercial enterprise. Cross-linking can help improve the listing of your pages 
on search engines, and it provides new clients with different ways to learn 
about you and to see different aspects of your professional personality. One 
feature of Twitter is perfect for business. Twitter allows users to view tweets 
that include a word of interest. Twitter users have cleverly supplemented 
this tool by adding the hashtag (#) mark as the first part of any word that 
is considered the topic of the tweet. So, if you want to know what is being 
written about privacy, search for #privacy, and you will find the topic in 
thousands of tweets. If your business is marketing, then the #marketing tag 
will find other interested practitioners to help you build a network. There are 
third-party tools for use with Twitter, like Tweetdeck, that can make the site 
even more effective as a microblogging, network-building, client-finding 
professional tool.

these external links back to Gettingthingsdone.com increase the site’s ranking 
on search engines.
Allen has created an intricate web of interconnected content—some offered 
through his website and some provided on social media sites, blogs, or newspa-
per and television website links. Allen is his business, and his business has been 
successfully developed around his online persona.
Expose Your Expertise
The Internet offers a practically infinite number of sites that allow you to 
stretch your intellectual wings and comment on the issues of the day. The smart 
Internet marketer takes his or her talents to the sites that customers and referral 
sources visit, and he or she stands out as a bright light, contributing positively 
to the conversation.
There is no reason on such sites to hold back information about what you 
do in your professional capacity or what resources you use. Anything a potential 
customer would want to know about your professional life should be quickly 
available to them on your business website or other sites. If you have testimonials 
from clients, post them online. If you have won awards for service or for high-
quality products, trumpet the awards online. If you are highly ranked in your 
profession, your website should tell us all about it.
The blog has become one of the premiere business tools of our era. Blogging 
is a particularly good way to demonstrate the depth of your expertise, your inter-
est and approach to your chosen field of practice, and the currency of your knowl-
edge. The serial nature of a blog supports short posts that you can write quickly, 
as well as providing your reactions to the news of the day. If there has been a 
particularly large acquisition or a merger in your industry, tell your clients about 
its implications in your blog. If your business has invented a particularly creative 
way to solve a common customer problem, your blog is a terrific place to explain 
it and to demonstrate how other clients could benefit from the same creativity. 
If you don’t like to write, then maybe a podcast or a video blog (vlog) is the 
better choice for you. Try operating your podcast like a traditional radio show, 
and bring in guests from your company and client list to talk about the current 
issues in your field. A 2015 study from the Pew Research Center showed that 
the percentage of Americans who listened to a podcast in January 2015 almost 
doubled since 2008, up from 9 percent to 17 percent. The percentage listening 
in 2015 was up two points over 2014 levels. This medium is growing as people 
become more familiar with listening to streams of talk over the Internet, and it 
is becoming a strong tool for business exposure.
If you are uncomfortable writing your thoughts, you may simply want to 
turn on your computer’s built-in camera and speak them to the world via a vlog. 
www.ebook3000.com

DRESS FOR CAREER SUCCESS
179
You can post these video discussions on your website, on a YouTube channel, or 
on any number of specialized blog and vlog sites. You could use the vlog to tell 
your customers all the new discoveries that were displayed at the latest industry 
conference you attended. You could show them a day in your life, perfectly 
illustrating the services you could provide to them. Or you could bring on guest 
speakers to provide testimonials. High production values tend not to be impor-
tant in vlogs, just personality and useful information. Vlogger Hank Green, who 
speaks primarily to teens and young adults about science, has reached a billion 
views on his VlogBrothers Channel, hosted with his literary brother John; in all 
their channel has earned 2.6 million subscribers. 
Take Advantage of Specialized Sites
No matter what field you work in, there are specialized websites that bring 
people in your field together. Participating on these sites is simple and can yield 
significant rewards. Projecting a positive, professional persona online can take 
many forms, and participating in industry-oriented websites is one of the easi-
est and most productive. These sites can be highly targeted, drawing primarily 
people in your industry who are interested in your vertical market. You probably 
already know the most important and popular sites in your professional area. 
Offering your expertise and punditry on these sites can draw customers and 
contacts to you who would not otherwise find you online or be aware of your 
area of specialty.
Successful Networking:  An Example
If you’re a restaurant consultant who wants to help other people open and 
operate restaurants in a cost-effective manner, many sites can introduce your 
expertise to the industry. For example, the National Restaurant Association 
offers a site full of information at restaurant.org, including a blog called “Mem-
bership Means Business,” where experts provide information to restaurant own-
ers. Writing for this blog would expose your ideas to the association’s members 
throughout the United States and provide the tacit stamp of approval from the 
National Restaurant Association.
In addition, a number of online magazines targeting the restaurant industry 
host websites that are hungry for content. Restaurantowner.com is a site where 
special contributors provide advice to people who own restaurants. The site 
touts its contributors as “uniquely qualified to assist existing restaurant owners 
and franchisees with their operating needs and growth strategies, and to assist 
independents in developing their growth plan to include a successful franchise 
program,” and the site shows contributors’ pictures and backgrounds. Sharing 
your knowledge on this site would provide you with a significant audience of 
owners who are interested in your services.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
180
Restaurantreport.com offers e-mail newsletters, social media support, and 
articles about restaurant management, operations, accounting and finance, 
public relations, and restaurant design, again allowing a consultant to target the 
precise audience who may need advice.
Sites such as the Food Service Forum allow people in the restaurant business 
to come together and talk to each other. Regular contributors on these sites can 
develop a personal rapport with potential customers. Participating in forums or 
chat sites allows you to “lurk” for a while and appreciate the flow of the conversa-
tion, see what types of people are asking and answering questions, and to slowly 
work your way into discussions, building trust along the way.
These sites also provide the opportunity to learn what your prospective 
customers are worrying about in real time and to propose solutions. You don’t 
have to be a published author or even an established blogger to highlight 
your expertise and meet new clients. Chatting on relevant sites allows you to 
write short articles and get a more intimate understanding of potential clients’ 
needs.
Of course, the Web provides hundreds of sites where restaurant owners can 
contribute to discussions about dining and entertaining, thus attracting custom-
ers to their locations and providing you, as a restaurant consultant, with valuable 
data about your industry. Most newspapers include a restaurant and dining sec-
tion, and those articles are searchable on the Web and generally include a space 
for comments. Many restaurant owners pay attention to the comments and 
criticism received online. A consultant can target specific restaurant groups and 
provide advice online that may lead to business.
In your industry there are probably similar Internet sites aimed at the same 
customers and referral sources that you want to cultivate. Look to your industry 
trade association—both national and local branches—for important sites that 
bring your target audience and you together. 
Check in with the big powers in your industry. What are they doing with 
their own websites, their social media accounts, and their participation in 
trade association online activities? Review the primary vendors that serve your 
industry. In many corners of the business world, vendors provide sites that pull 
together all of the market players for comparisons and best practices. Seek out 
other companies and discover how they take advantage of the Internet for com-
mercial gain.
Industry-Related Networking
Another goal of online participation on industry sites and topic-oriented 
message boards is to build a network of contacts. Out here in the real world, 
if you hang out at the golf, tennis, horse, or fitness club, you could stir up 
business from the people you spend time with. Visiting industry trade shows, 
www.ebook3000.com

DRESS FOR CAREER SUCCESS
181
industry-related conferences, and education events can bring you closer to 
another set of people who can help your career.
The online world works the same way. Your participation in a forum dedi-
cated to your profession could introduce you to many people with companies 
that are potential clients and who have common interests. Using online industry 
sites, you can meet the movers and shakers of your professional world without 
ever leaving your office or living room. Offer to help others when you can, and 
you will quickly learn that others will help you, too. You can use good judgment 
when you share your expertise without giving away trade secrets. You can build 
your list of contacts, make friends, meet clients, and learn more about your 
industry at the same time. The Internet hosts so many varied industry-focused 
sites that you can build a business in your field using its tools.
Linking Your Way to Success
If you put enough effort into your online presence, you may earn a link 
from other Internet sites to your home page or your Facebook page. Although 
these groups will not link to every site, they often will link to paid sponsors, to 
people who volunteer to serve as officers of the organization, to professionals 
who contribute useful content such as articles and blog posts, or to people who 
participate in work that improves the industry’s education and practices. You can 
easily place yourself in any of these roles with a contribution of time and effort.
Links from your industry’s trade groups or online industry magazines can 
certainly drive traffic to your site, but they are also likely to increase your web-
site’s search ranking on sites such as Google and Bing. These search tools factor 
heavily into a site’s popularity and the popularity of other sites that link to it. 
Accepting links from a major trade organization can only raise your site’s rank-
ing on a search list.
If you are ambitious about building an online persona into a successful 
professional marketing tool, you should consider taking the initiative to form 
your own industry-oriented website. The website may be the front door for a 
full-blown trade organization, or it could simply be a portal site that provides 
information helpful to everyone in the industry. If you control one of the most 
important sites for everyone in your industry, you develop power and influence. 
People would perceive you as an industry leader and come to you for help in 
marketing their own products and services.
Your own company’s professional website may provide similar information, 
but if you form a separate online place that is not associated with your brand but 
rather serves the entire industry, you can build a credible gathering place for the 
whole industry. You can still drive the activities of such a site and link it back to 
your own, but, if you welcome everyone in, including your competitors, you can 
gain a different kind of respect and position.

Using Links for Success: An Example
For example, an interior designer could create a site that provides useful 
links and information for the whole industry. This site might include a common 
database of all important furniture manufacturers, wallpaper retailers, flooring 
stores, and fixture specialists. The designer can expect to drive more traffic 
through the site than for a proprietary website that advertises a single service. 
Prospective customers, suppliers, vendors, and others interested in the industry 
will visit and participate.
Admittedly, creating a general industry site adds significant work to mar-
keting your business, but it also provides the promise of a much greater payoff.
Build Your Portfolio
For creative professionals and consultants, the Internet is a perfect place to 
publish your body of work, building credibility for your ability to produce cre-
ative works or deliver projects. When you apply for a job or meet a prospective 
client, your ticket to success is often your résumé or portfolio of work. Employ-
ers and prospects like to see your level of experience and the type of work you 
have done in the past. The Internet provides a publishing platform so that pros-
pects around the world can evaluate your work and learn about your background 
while they consider paying you for your expertise.
When your résumé or portfolio of work is your strongest sales tool, then the 
Internet is a perfect place to display it. Impress people with your experience as part 
of their initial contact with you. Turning to our David Allen Company example, 
its website includes a short but powerful biography page, and this page is the sec-
ond item listed on the Google search results for Allen’s name. Most of his résumé 
consists of affirmations from others in his field. A key endorsement states, “His 
thirty years of pioneering research, coaching and education of some of the world’s 
highest-performing professionals, corporations and institutions, has earned him 
Forbes’ recognition as one of the top five executive coaches in the United States.”
If your business includes a visual element such as artwork or architecture, 
the Internet serves as a perfect folio for your body of work. A prospective cus-
tomer can view your samples, note your professionalism, and judge whether 
your style strikes his fancy. The Web also provides you with the opportunity 
to request that other sites link to your work. If you design buildings, interiors, 
logos, or even websites, your work is likely to be on display on the websites of 
your past customers. You can link to their sites to show your past work being 
used by satisfied customers, helping you to attract new prospects.
Leverage Your Own Website
Every business needs a home base, especially those businesses that have no 
office, conference room, or storefront in the real world. For an exceptionally low

price compared to renting a brick-and-mortar space, you can create and main-
tain an online space that can be visited from anywhere in the world at any time 
of the day or night. You can design it in any way you choose and can pay third 
parties to maintain and operate the site for you.
If you are selling your services or a digitized product such as software, books, 
or music, then your online storefront can become a one-stop shop for your 
customers. You can automate every part of your sales, marketing, and service 
processes.
If, on the other hand, you are selling hard goods, such as handmade purses, 
ball bearings, or fireplace grates, then your website can become the front office 
for your order fulfillment operation.
No matter what profession you are in, build a website to tell your story to 
the world. The site doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated, but not having 
an online presence is like not having a business phone. Some professional sites 
are little more than billboards along the electronic highway, simply providing 
basic information about companies. This type of simplicity can work for many 
professionals. Professionals need a central site where their clients, prospective 
clients, or future employers can learn all about their relevant skills and expe-
rience. Your site can be a type of multimedia résumé, including videotaped 
speeches or award-acceptance ceremonies. You can include audio files highlight-
ing your deep understanding of the crucial problems in your industry in addition 
to written content. Even the simplest of websites can anchor the marketing for 
your professional career.
Certain companies, like manufacturers that sell to a limited number of 
industrial clients, may also benefit from a simple billboard website. The com-
panies only need a place that their few clients or prospective clients can find 
basic information, make easy contact with the company, and see the product 
options. However, even this straightforward and clean site can be a useful sales 
tool.
Of course, the Internet allows much more interactivity than a basic site 
might have, and your business would be wise to take advantage of these fea-
tures. Many professional sites encourage feedback from customers or clients, 
providing customer service right from the Web page. For example, if you’ve 
ever visited certain technology sites, you know that you can request and receive 
support by live chat with a qualified technologist. A separate chat function 
window will appear, and the customer can ask questions and receive answers in 
real time, rather than sending an e-mail and waiting for a response or dialing 
into a telephone call center. The same technician may provide the help in all 
three instances, but a customer who can deal in real time with a representative 
from the company website is likely to be impressed with the level of service 
offered.

These same chat tools are used more aggressively by some companies to spur 
sales. We have visited some professional sites where, as soon as the prospective 
customer enters the company’s site with the browser, a chat window pops up, 
offering a greeting and help navigating the site. These chats allow a personal-
ized experience on the professional Web page and the opportunity for targeted 
W h e r e  t o  B u i l d  Y o u r 
P r o f e s s i o n a l  S i t e
Although you might purchase, operate, and maintain a network server in 
your basement, it is much more likely that you will pay a service to host 
and manage your professional website for you. Many companies, including 
Network Solutions, GoDaddy, 1and1 Hosting, HostGator, and MidPhase, 
offer low-cost, professional Internet hosting solutions.
When choosing an Internet host, think about price and whether the 
company successfully hosts thousands (or even millions) of other sites. 
Consider security and backup capabilities. What interactive options does 
the hosting company offer, and how easy will it be to add those options to 
your site? Such options might include a chat function to talk directly to your 
customers or an e-commerce feature to process sales through your website. 
Confirm that your hosting company provides well-designed, cost-effective 
options for these functions.
Ask how many clients the host works with that are roughly the same 
size as your business. A hosting company that primarily services Fortune 
500 businesses may not be responsive to your service requests, whereas one 
that counts small businesses among its customers may not be able to service 
your company when it grows in size a few years from now. How much more 
will you need to pay if your professional site’s traffic increases tenfold?
A good hosting company should offer website analytics that tell you as 
much as possible about the customers that visit your site. The simplest ana-
lytic tools from GoDaddy boast that “more than 30 reports tell you every-
thing from how many people visit and what paths they take through your 
site to where in the world they live.” Most good Web analytics tools offer 
graphics that make the numbers easier to understand.
Additional services can include dedicated servers for your site, extra 
security services, and search engine optimization tools. You can add software 
or outside services for many of these functions, but good hosting companies 
may offer them as part of the service.

selling of products or services, even the ability to offer discounts that keep a hot 
prospect interested in making a purchase. Website analytics tools can tell your 
business what pages trigger the best reactions from the most prospective buyers, 
or at what point in the purchasing process a prospective buyer is likely to turn 
away. You can use this information to offer incentives or help at the precise 
points where a buyer needs encouragement.
You can offer your site in German, Portuguese, or Mandarin to spur inter-
national sales and signal your interest in selling within particular countries. 
Translation programs are inexpensive and easy to use.
Community Building
Another useful form of online interactivity is the community-building 
structure that allows your business’s clients to connect with each other. Com-
ments that others post on your blogs or in specialized discussion groups, as well 
as customer reviews of products or services, can be monitored by the experts 
within your company. These tools help you to understand what your customers 
want while allowing prospects to develop a deeper bond with your organization 
and a better understanding of your company’s philosophy and service principles. 
This type of tool can be risky, as unhappy customers may try to influence oth-
ers, but the best way to combat this problem is by keeping the customer chat 
feature in a premium section of the website where people are so committed to 
the brand that they pay a monthly fee to receive access to more information. 
Unhappy people will complain more if it doesn’t cost them anything to do so. 
Also, a properly written Terms of Use document for your website should allow 
your business to edit or refuse to publish certain types of comments.
The most common and productive form of customer interactivity on the 
Internet is called e-commerce. With e-commerce, your professional site can 
serve as a virtual storefront, selling your wares without the need for a brick-and-
mortar location.
Amazon.com is primarily an e-commerce company that sells just about every 
type of goods. An e-commerce site is not the kind of operation that an Internet 
business beginner should create himself or herself. Many e-commerce support 
companies exist on the Web to help businesses like yours with secure acceptance 
and protection of your customers’ personal information and with the processing 
of payment transactions. Your business’s Web developer or Web-hosting service 
is likely to perform these functions for a fee or will have recommendations for 
companies that specialize in this aspect of e-commerce.
On the Internet, your costs are much lower and your reach is much wider. 
E-commerce applications can be as simple as a sales tool that allows custom-
ers to buy one item at a time and may be as advanced as Amazon’s one-click 
purchasing applications or intricate shopping cart features that allow customers

It’s clear that the consultant and author David Allen built a Web strategy 
that optimizes the way search engines find his information, so that his site 
is easily discovered above all the Internet noise.
The Gettingthingsdone.com page is also a model for understated brand-
ing. Its home page focuses on the message that the company wants you to 
hear, showing how to move from being uncertain before using the Allen 
system to “Ready for Anything” after getting his help.
The site addresses the two target populations that would benefit the most 
from his services—organizations and individual entrepreneurs.
The website lists upcoming seminars, and it also includes free podcasts 
and a description of the Mastering Workflow Series that users can access for 
a fee, bringing them exclusive products not available to the general public. 
These services draw people into the site and provide a deeper interaction 
with the Getting Things Done methodology.
All of these features create a community of Allen acolytes and clients who 
not only pay money to the company, but as committed and paying com-
munity members, are also more likely to return frequently to the website, 
and therefore are more likely to buy other products and services from Allen.
Allen also includes his other trademark brand on this site—Getting 
Things Done, described on his website as a “groundbreaking work-life 
management system by David Allen that provides concrete solutions for 
transforming overwhelm and uncertainty into an integrated system of stress 
free productivity.”
Allen wrote a book called Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress Free 
Productivity, which he sells on the e-commerce portion of www.Davidco 
.com. His site is full of the “Getting Things Done” brand, which also car-
ries over to seminars Allen presents to businesses. Davidco.com provides a 
self-testing tool to find out how good you are at getting things done and 
how much you might need help from Allen. His website offers the “GTD” 
system, including compact disc training modules, books, and a brief online 
membership. His company provides Getting Things Done coaching and 
trainer certification and free short video instructions. His online learning 
center is also branded as GTD Connect. His site offers links to dozens of 
podcasts—audio files that allow you to listen to lectures and interviews on 
your computer so you can hear Allen tell you in his own voice how Getting 
Things Done can change your business and your life.

to buy many items now or save some for later. Most e-commerce service provid-
ers offer a wide array of service and pricing to meet your company’s sales needs 
online. Some even offer fulfillment of your product orders.
And, of course, turning your company’s website into an e-commerce shop-
ping site is the easiest way to connect to your customers and begin making 
money from the relationship.
Whatever functionality and details your primary website contains, it is your 
best opportunity for building your personal and professional brand. You can 
include pages of descriptions of your philosophy, services, products, links to your 
favorite sites, and lists of recommendations and product reviews from happy cus-
tomers. Your professional site is home base for your company. Make it as simple 
or elaborate as you need to support your online image.
Getting the Most from Professional Networking Sites
Your professional network may be your most valuable resource. Your business 
contacts can connect you with vendors or customers, warn you away from faulty 
service providers, and help you make the contacts you need to succeed in your 
career or grow your business.
A well-known aphorism in the technology industry called Metcalfe’s Law 
states that “the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the 
square of the number of connected users of the system.” Metcalfe’s Law sums 
up the concept that each person you add to your network brings a value larger 
than himself to the network as a whole. A network of sixty-four people is much 
more than four times as valuable as a network of sixteen people because of the 
corresponding increase in the number of their contacts. The value of a network 
is always greater than the sum of its parts. As you build online professional net-
works, remember that their value grows immensely with each new person that 
is added.1
The David Allen Company has apparently availed itself of nearly every 
type of online marketing strategy. Yet this entire Internet empire seems to be 
based on one primary website. All the other Web tools—blogs, videos, audio 
sessions, social media, Wikipedia—arise from or link back to this core site.

O p e n  a n  O n l i n e  S t o r e f r o n t
If you’re not prepared to operate your website as a full-fledged e-commerce 
store, the Internet offers opportunities to join a “virtual mall,” a website 
such as Amazon where people gather to shop and where they can find your 
products. One of the oldest and best examples of this kind of online shop-
ping mall is eBay, an online auction site that allows individuals and busi-
nesses to sell almost anything. People often visit eBay to shop for collectibles 
and hard-to-find items, including large-ticket items such as cars, industrial 
equipment, furniture, and computers.
eBay now offers both competitive auctions and fixed-price storefronts, 
but it also allows thousands of individuals and large companies like IBM 
to reach a larger and often specialized audience for goods. Whether you are 
selling mid-twentieth-century tiki torches, antique dolls, bronze busts of 
famous poets, or vintage car parts, eBay will serve as your storefront and will 
include your goods in user search results.
Amazon.com also offers similar services to sellers of books, music, or 
other goods available at Amazon stores. The primary differences between 
Amazon’s retail hosting model and eBay is that Amazon offers fixed prices 
from all of its retailers, and Amazon may compete against its hosted retailers 
with products of its own. Amazon is one of the world’s largest retailers in its 
own right. Conversely, eBay does not offer its own products in competition 
to its hosted retailers, and eBay sells many of its goods at auction, allowing 
buyers to bid against each other for a fixed period of time, with the highest 
bidder committing to purchase the item at auction.
These sites and others like them charge fees to sellers who offer goods 
through the various sales sites. For these fees, the sellers are entitled to list 
and sell items; to use the site’s e-commerce software platform, including 
the financial tools; and to receive consulting and assistance from the site’s 
experts in maximizing sales and shipping products. Most of these sites 
also build communities of sellers who talk to each other online and share 
tips, tricks, and traps of the online selling business, as well as sophisticated 
analytic tools that can help sellers explore and understand their sales figures 
better.

The Value of Internet Networking
The Internet offers one of the best networking platforms devised by humans. 
Geography is irrelevant on the Internet. You can find experts in your field any-
where on earth and enlist them to help your business or career. Similarly, timing 
is greatly diminished as a barrier to business because the Internet allows you to 
work from anywhere you want, so office hours are not critical. Many Internet 
tools such as e-mail and messaging functions on websites allow you to connect 
with colleagues at their convenience.
Digitized contact lists make your professional network searchable and organized 
into useful categories. New mobile applications even allow the participants in your 
professional network to keep track of each other’s locations at any given moment.
Social media guru Adrian Dayton advises:
To establish expertise online there are a number of things you can do. You can 
write online bios that demonstrate not just a specific practice area but that also 
show you to be exceptional and that highlight unique experiences that separate 
to tap into a worldwide marketplace of one-of-a-kind items. If you were a 
collector of toy train sets in the early 1990s, you could find some items for 
your collection from manufacturers’ catalogs or you could physically travel 
to a convention and swap with others who shared your interest. By 2000, 
eBay allowed you to chat with other collectors and find an entire world of 
rare items for your collection without ever changing out of your pajamas.
Now a hugely successful public company, eBay has purchased the PayPal 
payment system used in so many of its transactions, and subsequently spun 
off its financial businesses into separate companies. eBay expanded with a 
new and used car, boat, and motorcycle market, and it has added classified 
ads to its site. They offer a fashion section for new clothes as well as vin-
tage velvet jackets and period dresses. The company moved its site into the 
mobile market, with sales applications for iPhones and smartphones built 
on the Android platform.
For sellers, eBay charges fees to list each item and fees when the item 
sells. eBay also encourages buyers after a purchase to rate the seller in several 
different categories. The company provides sellers with advice on growth 
strategies, best practices, search visibility, and selling tools, as well as an 
entire shipping center and a center for selling to business. In 2008, both 
eBay and Amazon boasted more than 1.3 million seller accounts worldwide.

you from all other competitors. You can write articles, blog posts and commen-
tary on a regular basis so that when people do a Google search for your name 
they see the myriad of articles that you have created. Most importantly, engage. 
Don’t share your articles and sit back and wait for the phone to ring. Reach out 
to reporters, reach out to other influential bloggers and build relationships. There 
is not a Google algorithm that determines whether you have expertise, it is de-
termined by people. The more influential users of social media you get to know 
online, the more likely it is that you will become known for your expertise. Reach 
out directly to ideal clients and share your content that may be of use to them.
Dozens of Internet sites are vying for the right to host your primary professional 
network. Some of these sites, such as the BNI network and the Rotary Club, are 
traditional networking organizations with real-world counterparts that are building 
international connections on the Web. Others, such as Facebook, Google+, Yahoo! 
Groups, or NetParty, are social media sites that have migrated into the professional 
world and want to attract customers to companies using social media.
Some social media sites were created with the sole task of developing busi-
ness networks, like LinkedIn, Gather, HubSpot, and Networking for Profes-
sionals. Some business social networking sites are specialized, such as Tweeko 
for the technologically savvy professional person, Sphinn and Pixel Groovy for 
online marketers, and XING and Small Business Brief, which aim to serve the 
entrepreneurial crowd.
Some well-known career matching sites are more than just job-posting 
boards. Sites such as Monster.com and Careerbuilder.com also provide places to 
interact with others in your industry. Some of these sites are accessible by “invi-
tation only,” but most of them allow anyone to join and test the waters.
Choosing Your Networks
The first step in harnessing social media for your career or business is to pick 
one—or several—site(s) that are the best fit. What kind of a business network 
do you want to build, and how do you intend to use it? You may want to find a 
group of professionals with whom you can bounce around ideas for your com-
pany. You may want a broad group to serve as a safety net when you need to look 
for a new job. You may want like-minded professionals of differing expertise so 
that you can build a robust talent pool to pitch clients for projects.
Some sites are better than others for each purpose, so visit them and study 
what goes on and who is active there.
Working the Networks
Add links liberally to your professional website or to your profile page on 
social media. Many of these sites work by allowing people to invite others on the 
site into their network. The more networks you tap into, the more valuable each

of your contacts becomes. Many business people see links within their market as 
a reciprocal proposition. If you link to their site, they will link to yours. Remem-
ber that search engine algorithms take the number and quality of links to and 
from your site into account, so be generous with your links.

The best-known business-focused social media site in the United States 
is LinkedIn, founded in 2002 and now claiming more than 332 million 
registered users.* During the initial writing of this book, LinkedIn held an 
initial public offering that marked its value at roughly $8, or 520 times the 
company’s earnings.†
LinkedIn provides business people with several types of accounts, one 
free and other paid premium accounts with additional benefits. The site 
encourages registered users to list their résumés, along with school and work 
history, so that each user can be linked to classmates and current and former 
colleagues to build a vast network of professional contacts. LinkedIn makes 
it easy to invite these contacts to join your network and then recommends 
other people who seem like natural fits into the same networks.
When you register on the site, LinkedIn allows you to set up groups so 
that people in various networks can express news and opinions to those with 
shared interests. Group titles include such specialized functions as World-
wide Privacy Professionals, .NeT People (Microsoft Professionals), the India 
Leadership Network, and the Society of Emotional Intelligence Network. 
These groups bring people together by interest area, rather than personal 
knowledge, and provide a place to learn about your chosen field from other 
leaders in the field.
LinkedIn provides a downloadable toolbar for your browser so that you 
can stay connected all the time, and it offers a mobile application for use 
on smartphones. It also provides tools that connect directly into Microsoft 
Outlook, so your professional contacts can import easily into the LinkedIn 
social world.

Keep in mind that you are not just accepting an individual into your net-
work, but you are moving a step closer to his or her entire network as well. When 
you need information, customer contacts, or job ideas, these vast, extended 
networks could be helpful. If you can ask your entire LinkedIn network, and by 
extension each of the contacts in their networks, for the name of somebody who 
works in the Xbox division of Microsoft or in the legal department of the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, it’s likely that someone in that extended group can help 
you. Clearly, when looking for a job, your extended network is useful as well. 
Build your network of people who work in your industry and who know others 
in the industry as well. This kind of network can keep you apprised of job open-
ings before they are made public and cast a wider net of opportunity for you.
The next lesson for using your networks is to actively participate in the 
sites you choose. Continue to post interesting comments and findings in your 
area of expertise. Start a new interest group for mobile application development 
or medical practice marketing and see who joins and participates. Feel free to 
participate or moderate these discussions in topics that relate to your business 
or career. Make suggestions to friends looking for work or in need of assistance. 
The rest of your network will appreciate your willingness to help. You can use 
these sites to keep yourself front of mind for your professional contact group 
and impress them with your energy, interests, and intelligence. Smart online 
participation in a business-oriented network can turn network participants into 
friends, customers, referral sources, employees, and colleagues.
Building your online professional persona is much easier if you take advan-
tage of the tools available on the Web. Business networking sites provide an 
inexpensive and easy set of tools to build and grow professional relationships and 
to shine as an expert in your field.
Conclusion
Your online persona is not simply an attic to be cleaned and managed occa-
sionally. It has the potential to emerge as a valuable professional tool for you 
to attract new workers, impress colleagues and employers, and display your 
intellectual and other wares for customers. You can even use the Internet and 
e-commerce tools to build your own online business. Actively participating on 
the Internet in thoughtful and creative ways can help you to build a strong busi-
ness and to put forward your best professional image.

Chapter 10
Don’t Forget the Kids
T
hroughout this book we’ve provided information and advice about how 
your virtual persona can work for or against you. As an adult, you can 
take charge of your online reputation and even use it to be more suc-
cessful in your career.
Children face some of the same challenges, but they have unique vulner-
abilities. Also, today they are online in a big way, building up a reputation that 
will have an impact on their schooling, relationships, and careers in a manner 
that our world has never experienced before. Your online life may have been 
brief and easy to clean up; their online lives start before they are born and build 
up for years before they reach adulthood.
Your kids’ data are considered a valuable target too. Marketers would love 
to know them better. Technology companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and 
Google provide ways to reach them at home and at school. It was recently 
reported that more than fifty million teachers and students use Google programs 
at their schools around the globe.1
Hackers and other parents may check out your kid online. Unfortunately, 
fraudsters and predators are also out there. 
In this section we look at some of the differences between kids and adults, 
both in how each views online technologies and how they are exposed online.
Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants
If you worry about your kids online, you’re not alone. According to the Pew 
Research Center, one in three parents are concerned about their children and 
their digital habits.2
The first thing to understand is that kids online are different from you and 
me. If you were born before 1993, you are considered by most experts to be a 
“digital immigrant.” If your kids were born after 1993, they have been labeled 
“digital natives.” The generation born after 1993 most likely cannot imagine a 
world where they would have a question and could not use their smartphone to

look up the answer. They cannot fathom living without the Internet, where they 
have unfettered and instant access to information, answers, reservations, shop-
ping, and the ability to catch up with friends almost any place, any time.
Digital natives use phones as mini supercomputers, and sometimes they 
even make calls on them, if they must. A recent study shows that 88 percent of 
U.S. teens have access to a mobile phone. Teens are opting to use a smartphone 
instead of a computer; in fact, 91 percent of U.S. teens go onto the Internet via a 
mobile device. Ninety-two percent of U.S. teens go online daily, with 24 percent 
admitting that they are online “almost constantly.”3
Only 11 percent of teens use e-mail to stay in touch, and they like using a 
landline phone even less.4 Their preferred method of communication is texting, 
followed by social networking, and then actually making phone calls on their 
cell phones.
According to Nielsen in a cell phone study they conducted, nobody sends 
more text messages than girls aged thirteen to seventeen. They send and receive 
an average of 4,050 texts per month, or roughly 135 to 150 per day. The big-
gest voice usage is by adults aged twenty-five to forty-four years of age. Kids are 
texting, whereas adults are e-mailing and calling.5
For the digital immigrant, a phone is what you use to call people, and it has 
some other neat features. Digital immigrants may find it tough to explain why 
they have concerns about what the digital natives in their households share and 
do when they are online. No wonder we have a hard time getting our message 
across—they never get the message!
Digital natives pick up technology quickly and are adopting technology ear-
lier in life. AVG conducted a study polling 2,200 mothers with children between 
the ages of two to five years old across several countries.6 The households in 
the study all had Internet access. For the kids in the AVG study, 69 percent 
of the kids were able to use a computer, and 58 percent could play a computer 
game. Looking at the same group of kids, only 20 percent could swim and only 
52 percent could ride a bike.
Many digital natives spend most of their time, when they are not in school, 
online. One New York Times article about a study conducted by the Kaiser 
Family Foundation had a headline that read, “If Your Kids Are Awake, They’re 
Probably Online.”7 The results of the study actually shocked us and confirmed 
a growing trend in which kids from ages eight through eighteen spend up to 
7.5 hours a day connected to a phone, computer, television, or other electronic 
devices.
According to one source, 87 percent of young adults ranging from ages 
18 through 34 who own a smartphone admit they hardly ever disconnect from 
their phone. Four out of five responded that the first thing they do every morn-
ing is to reach for that smartphone.8

A fun way to check in on your usage and compare it to your kids’ usage is 
to try this app: http://www.checkyapp.com. The Checky app works in a similar 
way as Moment and Breakfree. All these apps are designed to show you how 
often you check your cellphone to help you create healthier digital habits. 
In a presentation at a grade school, we asked a group of fourth-grade boys 
what they wanted to be when they grow up. The enthusiastic answer, in unison, 
was “a professional YouTuber” referring to individuals who spend most of their 
waking moments on the Internet. These folks create videos about their interests, 
such as baking beautiful cakes or playing Minecraft, and they are paid to do so 
by advertisers. Try to beat that on Career Day at schools.
So, What’s the Harm?
Why should you be concerned about this extreme usage of the Internet? Every 
time your children go online, they create digital footprints that lead anyone, such 
as their friends, potential mates, college admissions, employers, cybercreeps, and 
cybercriminals to their digital persona. Every photo, video, comment, text, and 
e-mail is likely to be stored online or offline and tied to them indefinitely.
A poll of tweens and teens found that four out of ten kids regret something 
they have posted online. One out of three admitted that they share information 
online that they would not share in public. To top that off, 62 percent of kids 
lie to their parents about what they do online. With statistics like these, the 
numbers indicate that mistakes are being made by lots of kids online, including 
good kids with good heads on their shoulders.
If you are a digital immigrant, you are probably worried that your child’s life 
is now public on a digital billboard advertising both their wonderful activities, 
but also their mistakes, for all to see. You are right to be concerned. The good 
news is that there are things you can do to help your kids build an online persona 
that is positive while also protecting them from prying eyes.
For parents with newborns on the way and infants, you cannot start too 
early thinking about your child’s online persona. Some kids have a digital 
persona before they are even born. According to an international survey of 
2,200 mothers, 81 percent of the kids surveyed had some online presence that 
ranged from photos on a photo-sharing site all the way to their own domain 
names and social networking accounts. Some 33 percent of U.S. mothers in 
the survey said they are sharing their prenatal sonograms on the Internet. Kids 
are making tiny digital footprints while still in the womb, thanks to enhanced 
ultrasound technology and photo-sharing sites such as Snapfish and Shutterfly 
and social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+ 
that encourage photo uploads. The Internet now offers today’s digital version of 
yesterday’s baby book.

As a parent, you need to take steps now, whether your baby is coming soon 
or already here, to inventory what you are creating to ensure it is a digital persona 
that your child will be proud of when he or she grows up and that keeps your 
child safe today and in the future.
Here are a few ways to begin to get a handle on what your child’s online 
persona is today.
•  If your child is already online, take a moment to go to your smartphone 
or computer, and fire up your favorite search engine such as Duck-
DuckGo, Google, or Bing.
•  In the search box, type your child’s name and take a look at some of 
the results.
•  If you load McGruff Safeguard on your child’s computer, you can 
use a browser to see every website he or she visits. You can also see 
F r o m  D a y  0 :  P r o t e c t i n g  Y o u r  C h i l d ’ s 
O n l i n e  I d e n t i t y
Here are three key types of information you should always keep private 
online.
1.  Physical Characteristics: Do not chronicle online any personally identifying 
characteristics that can be used to target your child or his or her identity, such 
as unique physical traits such as birthmarks, the child’s full legal name, time 
and date of birth, genetic health issues, and weight. Save those details for the 
paper announcements, face-to-face conversations, or the offline baby book.
2.  Genealogy: Be careful about how much of your family tree is available online. 
It’s public information, but you don’t want to hand over your child’s full 
genealogy to the anyone on your Facebook page. Information such as mother’s 
maiden name or grandmother’s first name is used all the time to provide access 
to password-protected accounts.
3.  Unique Identifiers: Never e-mail your child’s name, date of birth, and Social 
Security information in a single message or include it in an attachment to an 
e-mail. If you must share this information, use the phone, or break the data 
up into several separate e-mail messages sent from different accounts. Yes, 
the data can still be stolen, but these two methods provide a good measure of 
security.

what photos your child is uploading and what social media comments 
they are posting. The software also allows you to block inappropriate 
websites.
Billboards on the Internet Highway
Because kids do different things online, it’s important that you understand 
how they expose personal information and how that information builds up over 
the course of their childhood and teenage years.
How Information Gets Exposed
The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, said: “People have really got-
ten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but 
more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has 
evolved over time.”9 This is the person who was one of the great minds behind 
the social networking service your kids either use now or will use in the near 
future.
Your kids would probably not walk up to strangers and tell them all the 
personal details of their life and your family, but they might be inclined to post 
those details on social networks to their circle of friends. One click and the rant 
or personal thoughts and fears become digital, and digital can be forever. This 
generation feels that publishing personal information online means that they are 
being open and honest. They don’t realize that they may not agree with their 
own posts in one week, one month, or one year from now. Still, those posts 
could be tied to them forever.
Your kids have many ways to expose their information, including their Inter-
net browsing habits, text messages, online journals, blogs, posted comments, and 
photo- and video-sharing sites. Devices they can use to post such information 
include video cameras, computers, smartphones, and tablets. New services and 
technologies that trade in personal information are coming on the market every 
day, and you can bet your kids will adopt them with lightning speed.
Today’s kids, because of their online habits, are heavily tracked by compa-
nies and advertisers. Your kid’s favorite websites might actually be the biggest 
offenders of Internet tracking. The Wall Street Journal looked at fifty sites that 
kids love to use to see if those sites tracked kids and their browsing habits. When 
they finished their tests of the fifty sites, they had a staggering 4,123 pieces of 
tracking technology on their computer. The tracking tools did not collect the 
names of the kids, but they did collect or estimate age, general locale, prefer-
ences, and even potential ethnicity.10
The website with the most tracking files? Google. When the Wall Street 
Journal did their study, they found that Google was able to indicate the favor-
ite sites of a ten-year-old girl. They showed her mom that Google pinpointed

her daughter’s interest in pets, photography, virtual worlds, and online give-
aways such as free screensavers or wallpaper. The mother was surprised, and 
the little girl exclaimed, “I don’t like everyone knowing what I’m doing and 
stuff.”
Google was recently questioned about their in-school privacy processes 
when kids and students use their Google platform in the classroom. You may 
not know this but Google recently surpassed other tech companies in the class-
room with Google Chromebooks representing 50 percent of tablet sales. Google 
also has a teaching platform called Google Apps for Education (GAFE) Core 
Services. The services include Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Classroom, 
Google Drive and Docs, and Google Hangouts. Google has signed a student 
privacy pledge and offers schools ways to customize the privacy features to pro-
tect student identities. The point is, the schools need to opt into these features. 
You can read more about Google’s commitment to student privacy on their 
education blog at: http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-facts 
-about-student-data-privacy-in.html.
After teaching Internet safety classes for kids in grades K–8, we have learned 
firsthand that many kids have knowledge of how to protect their privacy and 
security online. The problem is that they only use that knowledge to block out 
some of the adults in their lives, such as teachers, coaches, and parents, but not 
strangers. Consider these statistics: more than 50 percent of kids have admitted 
to friending someone they did not know. Roughly 20 percent of young people 
using Facebook are considering “unfriending” their parents or leaving Facebook 
and using another social networking site.11
Information Builds Up
Studies have proven that parents are the first line of defense for keeping 
kids safe online. Still, talking about the Internet might be challenging because 
the concept of “forever” is lost on many of today’s digital natives. Just as they 
can’t believe they’ll ever turn thirty, they don’t think about what would happen if 
today’s post turned up in their own future child’s search results twenty-five years 
from now. As we mentioned previously, every post to the Internet creates digi-
tal footprints that your children leave behind. But unlike footprints in the sand 
washed away by the tide and time, just because you cannot see their posts doesn’t 
mean they’re gone. A picture or status update your child posts on Facebook may 
get deleted, but somewhere out in cyberland, it still exists. It may reappear when 
your child least expects it and have disastrous results. 
As evidence of how valuable the treasure trove is considered to be, look at 
some of the alarming details of the VTech hack. VTech provides learning toys 
for kids. Hackers broke into VTech’s systems and ran off with the information 
of roughly 6.4 million kids, including names, gender, home addresses, ages of

the kids, IP addresses (which can be used to guess their geographic locations), 
and pictures of the kids as they used their devices. HaveIBeenPwned says this is 
currently the fourth-largest consumer data breach in 2015.12
Old-Time Rules That Still Apply
As a parent, you may feel overwhelmed and not sure where to begin. Most 
of us did not have the Internet to worry about when we were growing up, which 
makes it hard to talk to kids. Many parents tell me they have not even broached 
the subject because they themselves are not actively online other than, perhaps, 
using e-mail. The good news is that several old-school life lessons that were 
taught to our parents, their parents, and to us are still applicable today both 
offline and online.
H o w  t o  B e h a v e  O n l i n e
Six “old school” rules still provide a commonsense guide to how we should 
behave on the Internet today.
1.  Don’t post, text, or e-mail in anger. Old School: “Whate’ers begun in anger ends 
in shame.”—Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanack, 1734.
2.  It does not take much to ruin your online reputation or somebody else’s. Old 
School: “Little strokes fell great oaks.”—Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s 
Almanack, 1750.
3.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Old School: “Distrust and cau-
tion are the parents of security.”—Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanack, 
1733.
4.  Do not share personal information online—ever. Old School: The phrase “loose 
lips sink ships” was made famous during World War II on posters created by 
the United States and England to warn soldiers and family not to discuss any 
military matters such as departures, arrivals, or movements.
5.  Everyone online is a stranger—even people who act as if they know you. Old 
School: We can all recall parents, grandparents, and teachers telling us at an 
early age: “Don’t talk to strangers.”
6.  Online posts should be supportive and not destructive. Old School: If you can’t 
say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.

Cyberthreats and Cyberbullying
When we ask third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children during our Internet safety 
class, “How many of you know someone who has been bullied online?” it almost 
always happens that the entire class, or most of the class, raises their hands. 
When we ask them to share stories without naming names of the victims or 
bullies, most situations turn out to have been managed well by the kids but still 
awful for all involved. 
Cyberbullying is part of kids’ lives, and both victims and bullies suffer.
Cyberbullying Defined
According to the National Crime Prevention Council, cyberbullying is 
“using the Internet, cell phones, or other devices to send or post text or images 
intended to hurt or embarrass another person.” Cyberbullying can consist of 
anything from sending mean text messages to deliberately spreading rumors 
online. It may involve photos taken or posted without permission to embarrass 
a person. It could also involve sending repeated threats via texting or posting on 
the Internet or making fun of a person while encouraging others online to join 
in with the bullying. More than half of teens say they have been bullied online. 
Of those bullied, more than half do not seek out their parents or a trusted adult.13
The nature of cyberbullying is important for you to understand. Cyberbul-
lying is
•  24/7. For the victims, cyberbullying feels like it never stops. They may 
see posts and threats on their social networking sites. Sometimes the 
cyberbully taunts the victim at gaming sites and even sends threatening 
text messages. Bullying used to be confined by the school day, so that 
victims would get a reprieve at home. Not anymore.
•  Everywhere. Bullies go online using a variety of technologies and ser-
vices. They find their victims at home, at school, in the mall, and in 
bed at night. Because more than 80 percent of teens use a cell phone 
on a regular basis and never turn it off, this tends to be the way that 
they are targeted first. In addition to mean voicemails and texts, the 
bolder bullies take their taunts and threats online, where they can get 
an audience.
•  Extremely public and viral. The online form of bullying plays out in 
front of thousands of people. Recently, there have been some tragic 
cyberbullying situations in the news that are heartbreaking for all 
involved. In these situations, bullies didn’t handle their anger, sadness, 
or grievances in a constructive manner. By playing out these emotions

in online attacks, the public shame they caused their victims drove 
those victims to drastic actions.
We have all read about child suicides attributed to a target’s inability to cope 
with cyberbullies. Here are just two examples of cyberbullying cases that caused 
damage to the aggressors.
One budding basketball star, Taylor Cummings, was not seeing eye-to-eye 
with his basketball coaches, so he typed out his frustrations online: “I’m a kill ‘em 
all. I’m a bust this #!@$%^ [expletive removed] up from the inside like nobody’s 
ever done before.”14 School officials took the teen at his word, and they expelled 
him. With an expulsion on his record, he may never realize his dream of a sports 
career. Even though his taunts were directed at adults, this situation involves a 
cyberthreat.
In another case in Seattle, a middle school principal dealing with cyberbully-
ing and physical bullying of a student identified twenty-eight students that were 
involved and suspended all of them. Suspensions do not sit well with college 
admissions boards, especially at institutions that have a heightened awareness 
and sensitivity to cyberbullying.
The Bullying Type
Several states have put into place cyberstalking and cyberbullying laws. If 
your kid is the bully, there could be legal repercussions that could have an impact 
on his online reputation.
So who are these cyberbullies? The cyberbully does not have an exact profile, 
although girls tend to cyberbully more than boys. Otherwise wonderful kids have 
been known to cyberbully, join in, or quietly watch another kid being victimized. 
Online bullies might also be physical bullies. Sometimes kids who are bullied 
at home themselves go online and feel that they have the power and cloak of 
anonymity to bully others to relieve their frustrations. Other times, kids just join 
in with other kids because of peer pressure.
Your kid may actually be a cyberbully. If you ever find that your child has 
bullied another online, after apologizing to the victim, look for ways to clean up 
your child’s online accounts so the victim can no longer see the posts and, hope-
fully, your kid will not have regrettable lapses in judgment come back to haunt 
him or her later. Bullies with unchecked behavior rarely grow out of this habit 
without some emotional scars. Beyond the digital tracks they leave behind, they 
do not learn good anger management and coping mechanisms for dealing with 
stressful social interactions. Studies have shown that children who habitually 
bully others tend to have a higher incidence of depression and sometimes drug 
and alcohol abuse in their adult lives.

Helping Cyberbullying Victims
In many cases victims are those who are isolated from others. They just seem 
like somebody who could be bullied. Those with higher self-esteem and a large 
set of friends are much harder to bully. Often it is not the characteristic the bully 
taunts the victim about (you’re fat, Muslim, or wear glasses) but the mere fact 
that the person is vulnerable that attracts a bully. 
Victims, of course, assume it was their weakness that invited a bully to 
attack, but the reality is that weakness is just a convenient hook for an aggres-
sive act.
Look for certain clues. If a kid seems withdrawn from school friends, avoids 
going to school, or suddenly avoids the Internet, he or she may be a victim of 
cyberbullying. Look for behavior that seems uncharacteristic for that person: is 
she quicker to get angry or get upset? A drop in grades or loss in appetite may 
be other signs to watch for.
Here are some tips for things you can do to help victims of cyberbullying:
1.  Golden Rule: Tell your kids that you will not accept any excuses; they are 
not allowed to post negative posts or taunts about other people online. 
No exceptions.
2.  Safe Zone: Instruct your kids to contact you immediately if they are the 
victims of cyberbullying or if they see it happening to someone else. 
Promise them a “safe zone,” where the two of you will work together on 
the best solution to notify the appropriate adults. Also, make sure they 
know you will not cut them off from the Internet, which is an integral 
part of their lives.
3.  Not Your Fault: If you are talking to a victim, make sure he or she un-
derstands that he or she is not at fault. Often children believe that there 
is something wrong with them that prompted the bullying, and they 
need to be reassured that they did not cause the bullying.
4.  Proof: Your gut instinct might be to delete the hurtful posts, but you 
may need them as evidence. At a minimum, take screen captures using 
your computer’s Print Screen feature so you can discuss the postings 
with the appropriate adults or authorities.
5.  Block: You can block messages from a bully using e-mail or other soft-
ware filters. Sometimes blocking access to a victim is enough to make 
a bully stop.
6.  Law Enforcement: Get officials involved if physical threats, nudity, or 
fraud are involved.
7.  School Officials: If the cyberbullying involves classmates, contact your 
principal and/or your school board. Most schools have instituted zero-
tolerance policies for bullying and can help you handle the situation.

8.  Counseling: If the cyberbullying was frightening or prolonged, seek 
counseling for your child and yourself.
Digital Is Forever
The fact that kids can expose personal information or get involved in a cyberbul-
lying event is significant because what they do online may last their entire lives. 
In addition, such exposure may open them up to cybercreeps, pedophiles, and 
crooks. One way you can help them protect themselves, as you’ll see later in this 
section, is by friending them and helping them understand the importance of 
passwords.
Kids’ Posts Haunt Them
Has your kid posted likes, comments, or pictures of brands that give off a 
negative image? If your child doesn’t drink alcohol or do drugs but does post 
pictures of movie star substance abusers, it will not come across positively, espe-
cially to people who do not know your child.
In another news story, a college student at the University of North Caro-
lina–Charlotte was frustrated after a long, hard day at work waitressing.15 One 
couple hung out at a table for three hours and left her a five-dollar tip. She had 
about one hundred friends on Facebook and tight privacy settings. She needed to 
vent, so she did what many digital natives do—a quick and short Facebook post: 
“Thanks for eating at [restaurant], you cheap piece of camper.”16 Her employer 
was alerted to her post, worried about the restaurant’s reputation, and they fired 
her. She admits she used bad judgment but had no idea it would cost her a job.
Your child should learn this lesson now before online venting leads to a lost 
job or relationship. Look for negative posts that your child might be creating, 
from criticizing friends and teachers to self-destructive posts. These posts can 
be a case for parental involvement but also something to help you teach your 
child online savvy, before their postings are viewed by others in a critical and 
negative light.
For example, would you want your child’s rants and negative comments to 
be part of the record for their online reputation when they are being checked out 
by prospective employers or college admissions reviewers? Both of these sources 
look for photos, associations, and posts. There are actually cases where prospec-
tive students wrote negatively about the college they just visited and then sent in 
an application for admission. Guess who didn’t get accepted?
What might seem like harmless or impulsive fun could not only ruin your 
kid’s reputation but also get them in trouble with the law.
In Washington State, three teens found out the hard way that one quick 
click on the smartphone can affect their reputation for a long time.17 The three 

Protecting Your Internet Identity

teens were arrested for sending a naked photo of a fourteen-year-old girl from 
a cell phone. I wish the story ended there, but it does not. The texted photo 
went viral and was forwarded to students in four different middle schools in the 
area. This constitutes child pornography. In situations like this, if these teens 
are convicted, they will have to register as sex offenders. The girl’s humiliation 
could last a lifetime, and sex offender registration is forever.
Bad Guys Lurking Online
In a story about child predators, Houston, Texas’s KHOU Channel 
11 noted that Amanda Hinton of the FBI said this about social networking sites 
and kids: “The predator, basically, it’s like a shopping mall. He looks through 
the social networking sites, he looks for someone he’s interested in talking to, 
and he capitalizes on what he sees their interests were.”18
By understanding who the predators are and their tactics, you and your kids 
can stay safer.
Kids Talking to Strangers
A survey by TRUSTe and Lightspeed Research found that 68 percent of 
young adults have accepted friend invitations from people they do not know.19 
This can create grave repercussions to their online persona because the strang-
ers may entice kids to do things online that their true friends would not. In the 
same survey, eight out of ten parents wished they could have more control over 
what their tweens, teens, and young adults are posting online, including a delete 
function.
Internet studies have shown that kids can tell you they know not to talk 
to strangers online and they know not to give out their personal information. 
However, if you put a pop-up window or ad in front of them promising prizes 
and money, the cautionary part of their brain turns off and they will click and 
tell everything for a chance to win the prize. 
This is especially true of younger children. During Internet safety classes 
with kids in grades K–5, many admit that they know they should not fill out 
survey forms or click on the jumping frog on the screen, but these temptations 
are simply too tempting to pass up. Besides, what if that sweepstakes entry or 
pop-up game was the real deal that one time? Often we hear that, after clicking 
on pop-ups, kids’ family computers froze and the families had to pay to have 
them fixed. This is not just annoying but a potential danger to your entire fam-
ily’s online personas. If your kid introduces a virus onto the home computer, the 
computer virus may be used to collect personal information about your family 
members that could be used to commit identity theft.
Ask your child if he or she would leave the front door of your house wide 
open all night long for any criminal to enter and abuse everybody in the family.

Kids may seem rebellious at times, but no matter how rebellious, once they 
understand this type of analogy, they get the need for safety. Nobody likes to 
get scammed or robbed.
Bad Guy Tricks
An eighteen-year-old man in Wisconsin posed as a girl on Facebook to 
trick young men into sending nude photos. He was sentenced to fifteen years 
in prison.20
In another sad story, three teenage girls were at a party, visited an online 
chat room, and flashed their breasts. The party ended, and the girls went 
home. Within a week, one of the girls started getting threatening e-mails. 
The threat? That pictures were taken when she flashed her breasts and the 
creep would post them online to all her Myspace friends unless she provided 
more sexually explicit photos and videos. Instead of telling an adult, she 
complied with the perpetrator’s disgusting requests. Eventually, she asked 
for help. Police and federal authorities became involved and found the 
cybercreep. The nineteen-year-old man was charged with sexual exploita-
tion.21 Think this is rare? Think again. This practice even has its own term, 
sextortion.
Recently, one of the authors of this book, Theresa, reconnected with friends 
from her college years and colleagues from earlier in her career via Facebook. It 
was so exciting to catch up, see photos, and see how much their families have 
grown. The more she clicked on the profiles, the more she learned about the 
kids. Thankfully, all the kids had a positive online image. Theresa did not see 
any heavy partying or negative posts. However, if she had been a cybercreep, 
they had all left enough digital tracks and clues online that she could have eas-
ily impersonated the kids or contacted these kids and impersonated a friend of 
their parents.
In one situation, she was able to see photos of the kids getting ready for a 
prom, learning the kids’ names, the places they visited, and the address of their 
homes. Online there was a full and open chronology of the events in these kids’ 
and young adults’ lives. The parents’ privacy settings were moderate, but the 
kids’ settings were wide open.
A kid on a laptop in a bedroom is exactly what child predators are look-
ing for. In a child pornography arrest, Jason Bezzo was accused of having a 
large child pornography collection. He had seven hundred gigabytes of child 
porn—that is, hundreds of thousands of photos and videos. Authorities believe 
that he obtained a considerable amount of his collection while he was visiting 
the kid-friendly video chat sites blogTV and Tinychat.22
It is critical that you protect your kid’s online persona from snooping cyber-
creeps and cyberpredators. In the next section, we tell you how.

Raising Good Digital Citizens
There are several things you can do as a parent or caregiver to help kids to not 
only stay safer online but also put forth a more positive online identity that will 
serve them better in later life. As a side benefit, you can help to ensure that 
nothing your child does online will reflect badly on you. Whether your son or 
daughter is e-mailing, chatting, texting, gaming, or connecting through social 
networking sites, the information in this section will help you keep them on 
track.
First of all, it is important that you talk to your kids about their digital 
persona as early as possible to avoid problems later in life. Before they have an 
e-mail or Facebook account is the right time to set ground rules and have con-
versations. If they already have one, plan to begin talking to them about their 
digital persona now. You may read this and shrug your shoulders, saying, “My 
kid is a good kid and has a good head on his shoulders.” That is probably true, 
but the Internet is still a test bed for them as they learn the ins and outs of having 
freedom online and growing up.
Although most of the big social media sites do have age restrictions, anyone 
with a little tech savvy would be able to set up an account, and it is really hard 
for these sites to definitively prove the person signing up is the age they say 
they are. The father of a young girl recently sued a major social media company 
for failing to enforce its age restriction policy after claiming his daughter was 
exposed to sexual predators when she signed up for an account at age eleven. 
Granted, she seemingly violated the site’s age policy but parents can use this as 
a teachable moment.
Discuss your expectations with your younger child. Tell them you don’t 
want them to get a social media account without discussing it first. If you 
find that your underage child has created a Facebook or other social media 
account, contact the site and ask them to delete the account promptly. When 
you’re ready to allow your kids to access social media, make sure they don’t 
share their personal details (date of birth, school, and location) on any social 
media site.
Follow Them There
You need to be where your kids are online. In the United Kingdom, a study 
by the National Citizen Service asked kids where they seek comfort when they 
are stressed. The girls in the study said they seek advice or comfort on social 
media before they talk to their parents.23
Teens and millennials in the United Kingdom are using social networks 
more often than any other age group, using apps such as Snapchat and Insta-
gram to stay in touch.24
www.ebook3000.com

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS

In the United States, Facebook, although not exclusively used by teens, 
is still a popular social media landing spot for kids ages thirteen to seventeen. 
Seventy-one percent of teens are using the site, and half of teens say they also 
use Instagram and 40 percent like to use Snapchat.25
There is also the popular After School app. What we do not like about this 
app is that it breaks our cardinal rule of telling you where your kids are. No 
adults are allowed as members. What we do appreciate about this app is that 
they have built in a few safety features that parents and teachers alike can appre-
ciate. It has an algorithm built in that looks for keywords and can trigger a fast-
response system that contacts authorities if a threat is detected. If needed, police 
can trace a post to a particular device. The app is also equipped with a warning 
system that flags any worrisome messages about being depressed or angry and 
triggers a message asking if they would like to text with a counselor. If parents 
know about the app, they can set filters to block certain content.
E-mail Guidelines
Rites of passage for your kids include following the latest fashions, listening 
to new music, and getting their first driver’s license. These are all experiences 
you enjoyed as a tween and teen. But there are things you did not experience—
for example, getting your first e-mail or social media account and posting your 
first information online.
Rules for determining the right age for e-mail accounts, social network-
ing accounts, smartphones, and other access to the Web are not hard and fast. 
However, if you need someone to play the tough guy when you tell your kid no, 
blame the online companies’ age guidelines. Several Internet e-mail service and 
social network providers do have age limits and require kids to be at least twelve 
to thirteen years old to access their services.
However, if a service has no age limitations, age should not be the only 
factor in your decision. Another factor to consider is the maturity level of your 
children when they are happy, sad, or mad. If they are still immature or over-
emotional, Internet e-mail and social networks might not be a good fit for them.
If you decide to let your child have his or her own e-mail account, consider 
these areas of vulnerability to keep your kids and their online personas safe.
•  Account Name: Choose an e-mail address that does not identify a 
child’s name, age, or gender.
•  Rules: Discuss ground rules about appropriate e-mail communication.
•  Let them know that they are not really anonymous and that cyberbul-
lying, sexting, and sending pictures via e-mail are dangerous. Make it 
a rule to avoid clicking on links in e-mails. Tell them that the rule of 
“don’t talk to strangers” and the Golden Rule both apply online.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
208
•  Attachments: Tell children not to open attachments without consult-
ing you first. Kids are notorious for clicking on all kinds of links and 
sending infected attachments to others.
•  Review: Tell them you will be reviewing their e-mails regularly, and 
ask them to make sure their friends know that their e-mail account 
will be monitored.
Online Chats
Chatting is one area where parents feel defeated. There are free services 
popping up periodically that make it easy for kids to exchange text and video 
chat with friends and strangers. Many parents block these sites but, after a 
while, get overwhelmed trying to keep up with new ones. Like Lucy and 
Ethel desperately trying to keep pace with the chocolate factory production 
line, their good intentions can’t keep pace with the number of chat sites out 
there.
In conducting research for this book, we visited several video chat sites. 
There were three reoccurring themes across the sites that we noted.
•  Almost every young person online was in a bedroom while chatting.
•  More than 50 percent of the kids were sitting on their bed conducting 
video chats.
•  There were no parents in the background monitoring their chats.
Discuss house rules for technology use when your kids are at school, home, 
or away from home. When kids are in their bedroom on a laptop or smartphone 
with video chat capability, this is a recipe for disaster. Kids connected to the 
Internet should be in a common family space, even if you are not looking over 
their shoulders.
Make sure your kids know that chat rooms are wide open, easy to use, and 
although some harmless fun can be had there, these sites are a magnet for pedo-
philes and other creeps.
In addition to children’s video chat sites, there are online video chat services 
that were designed for businesses and consumers that are used by kids. The 
good news is that many of these offer privacy settings, so you can lock your 
kid’s profile down and keep strangers out. These services include: Skype, Apple 
FaceTime, AOL’s AIM chat service, and Yahoo! Messenger.
Some sites you may want to visit to do your own research are listed here:

Be Aware of Secret Apps
One category of apps is a growing concern for parents who do their best to 
keep tabs on their teens’ digital activities on smartphone and tablets. These so 
called secret apps may look like your average smartphone app, but there’s a huge 
market for secret apps, also called decoy apps, that can hide activity on a cell phone. 
There are often legitimate reasons why a person may want to hide mes-
sages on their cell phones. They might be protecting sensitive, personal, or 
work-related information or safeguarding against phone theft. Your kids may be 
testing the boundaries of their individual privacy, or they may be using the apps 
with less pure intentions.
The names of the apps will change over time but here is a short sample list 
of apps as of the writing of this book that you may want to look for.
•  9Gag allows you to send memes and pictures online. The content isn’t 
currently moderated and there have been past reports that 9Gag has 
been used by cyberbullies. Some swatting cases (when someone calls 
911 and convinces police to raid an innocent person’s house) are alleged 
to have originated on 9Gag.
•  Cover Me hides text messages, documents, photos, phone calls, and 
more. 
•  Secret Apps hides texts, photos, and more and will secretly take a 
picture of anyone who tries to access your files. Secret Apps looks just 
like a normal Apple iOS app. 
•  Vault-Hide hides message and data in a vault. This vault is password 
protected and camouflaged. 
•  Hide SMS ensures that incoming SMS messages don’t show up on 
the phone and go into a vault. The vault notifies the user when mes-
sages arrive. 
•  Hide Text SMS & Calls hides your call logs, photos, and texts. 
Want to know how big this market is? Go to your app store and type 
“secret” in the search bar. You’ll be amazed at the apps you find and the number 
of times they have been downloaded!
Show, Don’t Tell
The best rule of all for parents is “show, don’t tell.” Parents should use social 
networks and set the example. A great way to share privacy and security concerns 
with each other is to talk with each other. Share news headlines that show both 
positive and negative stories about social media. You can also play Internet safety 
games together to make sure that everyone is up to speed on the latest threats. 
Some of my favorites are at NSTeens.org and OnGuardOnline.gov.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
210
Don’t make assumptions about the safety of any app. Carnegie Mellon con-
ducted a study in 2014 that looked at more than one million apps to evaluate 
user privacy. They found that some of the fun games like Fruit Ninja or Angry 
Birds were some of the bigger offenders of collecting user information, whereas 
Facebook and some Google apps actually did a better job guarding privacy. 
A great way to really understand what the privacy policy of any site or app 
means is on CATSMI.CA. You can also try out the new Privacy Grade database 
at PrivacyGrade.org for more information on Internet privacy policies.
A Primer on Texting
Love it or hate it, it’s time you became a lot savvier about texting. Nielsen 
surveyed three thousand U.S. teenagers between thirteen and seventeen years 
old. Girls sent roughly 4,050 text messages per month. Boys sent roughly 2,539. 
You don’t have to be a math whiz to determine that that’s a lot of text messages 
per day.26
In a 2010 survey, 42 percent of teens said they can text with their eyes 
closed. Some 43 percent of teenagers say texting, not safety, is the number-one 
reason for asking for a cell phone. About 22 percent of teens prefer texting over 
phone calls because they consider it easier and faster.
Do you feel as if you need a translator to come with you when you read your 
kids’ posts? You are not alone. Many of the posts are a combination of strange 
abbreviations, hashtags, and graphical symbols called emojis. The strange abbre-
viations might be something called leetspeak. Hashtags are usually words jammed 
together with the pound sign, the “#” in front of them for emphasis. Emojis are 
those smiley faces and other characters you might see in your text messages. We 
are all aware that to keep up with the times, we have to keep up with things such 
as new TV shows, Top 40 music, and the latest slang used by our kids. In the 
case of keeping up with emoji, hashtags, and leetspeak, the shortened messages 
that your kids use when they text on their smartphones, understanding what kids 
are saying can help you keep them safer.
Emoji Revealed
If you are not using emojis when you text with someone under the age of 
twenty, you need to read this section to get up to speed. Emojis tend to have 
different meanings around the world. In a recent study of emojis tracked by the 
company Swiftkey, they found that Americans used the most random emojis 
and often used the cake emoji more than other countries. Canadians tend to use 
emojis focused on money, sports, and violence. The French and Russians use 
emojis with hearts more often than other countries.27
Want a translation to understand and use emoji properly? Ask your kids; 
they are the best and most current source. You can also visit http://www.iemoji

.com/popular/emoji. This site tells you each emoji’s history, if it’s popular or not, 
and many of its common meanings. 
When we asked kids why they liked to use emojis they said they found it 
easier to convey their true feelings. When delivering a tough message if they 
added a heart or a smiley face to it, that means they care about the person 
enough to deliver the message. Sometimes, kids said that emojis told everything 
without having to type a word. This confirms the old adage, a picture is worth 
a thousand words.
Leetspeak Speaks for Them
Kids are so good and quick at communicating on their phones that leetspeak 
is becoming a part of our language. Here’s a list of ten text message leetspeak 
terms that kids commonly use. See if you need to brush up on your leetspeak.
IMHO (in my humble opinion) 
PAW, PIR or 9 (parents are watching, parents in room) 
TBH (to be honest)
IDK (I don’t know)
Totes (totally)
BFF (best friends forever)
<3 (heart)
2H2H (too hot to handle)
420 (let’s party—could also involve drugs/alcohol)
,!!!! (talk to the hand)
53X (sex)
Did you know what all of these meant without looking them up? If you 
didn’t, you’re not alone. If you would like a handy source, try asking your kids 
to tell you what the leetspeak means or visit this reference guide at: http://www 
.abbreviations.com/acronyms/SMS.
As of this writing, there are several translators and guides to understanding 
text messages. You can use these free tools if you must, but the best way to learn 
and connect with your kids is to ask them what a text message means. If you’re 
not sure you believe the answer, then look the term up by typing the text mes-
sage into your favorite search engine.
Sexting 101
You might not want to think about it, but many teens are sexting. A 2012 
study in the Journal of Pediatrics indicates that sexting is a new norm among 
young adults. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy28 shows that 
nearly 40 percent of all teens have posted or sent sexually suggestive messages. 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
212
This may make you uncomfortable but talking about sexting is probably the 
most important talk you must have with your tween or teen. Here are some tips 
for how to approach the topic: 
1.  Establish a Safe Zone. Teach your kids to talk to you about these issues 
and promise them that you will not overreact.
2.  Be Helpful. Think about what you would do if your child did send a 
nude photo to someone and it is now making the rounds. Focus on 
helping, not punishing.
3.  Rehearse. Someone will ask them, at some point, to text a nude. Work 
through some options for how they want to handle that situation, or 
offer a few canned responses. You might use humor to suggest that your 
kid consider sending nude animals such as chicks, bunnies, or puppies. 
Use the morality line: my parents won’t let me do that. You can also 
suggest they simply ignore the request and tell the requestor in person 
that you are flattered but you don’t do these.
4.  Be Alert for Sextortion. Sextortion is real. It hurts. Often laws and law 
enforcement cannot offer much help to the victims.
5.  Legal Issues. The distribution of nude photos of someone younger 
than eighteen is illegal. The parties involved could be charged with 
exploitation of a minor and possession of pornography. This can 
result in fines, jail time, and having to be registered forever as a sex 
offender.
Keeping Tabs with Location Software
Most of us remember growing up with a favorite hangout where we could 
connect with our friends. With many kids going to schools across town and tak-
ing part in far-flung after-school activities, making such connections is not as 
easy as it once was.
Today kids check in with friends and let people know how to find them 
by using check-in or location software. Some popular location services used 
today include Facebook Places, Waze, and Foursquare. These services are free 
and encourage frequent check-ins. Foursquare check-ins can result in a person 
being named “mayor” for the most visits or even presented with coupons and 
discounts. This is a great and fun way for kids and adults to stay connected to 
their friends. However, from a security standpoint, your kids are clearly broad-
casting where they are and where they are not (e.g., at home). Would you want 
someone scrutinizing where your kid hangs out and judging him negatively 
based on where he or she spends his or her time? What is the perception of a 
kid who is the mayor of the local game place or mayor of a convenience store in 
a seedy part of town?

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS
213
Talk to your kids about these services. If they are using them, you should, 
too. Test them out and make sure your family is aware of the trail of information 
about their activities they are leaving for all to see.
If your main concern about your teen’s location is his or her driving safety 
and phone use while driving, there’s an app for that called Canary-Teen Safety. 
This free app is designed to stop distracted driving by sending you notifications 
in real-time when your child is engaging in risky behavior. For example, the app 
lets you know if your child is using the phone while driving, exceeding a speed 
limit that you set, traveling into areas that are off-limits, staying out past curfew, 
or traveling near possible bad weather.

Your Kids and Online Gaming
Kids love to play games. In a recent Internet safety class, we were talking to 
kids in kindergarten and first grade. We were going over the rules with them and 
getting lots of nods, but the kids were not enthusiastic until Theresa asked, “By 
a show of hands, who likes to play games on the computer, Internet, game sta-
tion, or smartphone?” All the hands went up, and several kids said, “You forgot 
to mention the iPad!” When we asked these younger kids where they game, they 
said they are usually in a public area of their houses.
This answer does not hold true for middle school kids, who will play a game 
anywhere. Most of them say they go into a bedroom or family room so the gam-
ing noise doesn’t disturb their parents. In the spirit of “be where your kids are,” 
this is the wrong answer.
Many electronic games can link two players or two thousand players from 
different locations to chat and play together.
Here are some tips for protecting your kids when they’re gaming online.
•  Remind your kids that everyone is a stranger. If a friend invites him or 
her to game online, have him or her call that friend first to verify that 
it’s really that friend.
•  Make sure your home computers are up to date with the latest ver-
sions of firewall software and antivirus and antispyware.
•  Create a safe zone. Make sure your kids know that you will not take 
away privileges or stop them from playing if they come and share a 
situation with you that makes them uncomfortable.
•  Take time to play. Prescreen all your kids’ games before they are 
allowed to play them. Even if you are not a great gamer, you can play 
games set to “demo” or “easy” to get the idea of the game and how it 
works. Ask your kids to play their games with you once in a while.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
214
•  Account names are important. Just as an e-mail account name should 
never be your child’s nickname or identify him or her as a young boy 
or young girl, a gaming account name should not give away personal 
information.
•  Choose safe pictures. Some games encourage you to post a picture 
with your account name. Instead of posting a picture of your child, 
have him find a fun avatar or picture of a cartoon character to use.
•  Block text and voice chat on games.
Your Kids and an Online Moral Compass
There’s no question that teens are far more technology-savvy than their 
parents in most cases. The question is whether they know when to use the tech 
skills they’ve acquired and when to stop.
We see it in the headlines. The hackers who broke into the UK cell phone 
company, TalkTalk, in 2015 were younger than age nineteen. The hackers 
who broke into the personal e-mail accounts of the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency Director and Director of the Department of Homeland Security in 
2015 were also younger than nineteen. There was a case in the United King-
dom where six teens between the ages of fifteen and eighteen were arrested 
for using a tool called LizardStresser, an online tool for attacking websites. 
Authorities say they hacked into a newspaper, their school, and gaming com-
panies. Teens were swept up in what police called “Operation Vivarium.” This 
was led by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA). The NCA was watching 
the Lizard Squad that offered the tool online and which is the same group 
suspected of attacking Sony and Microsoft on Christmas Day of 2014. The 
teens suspected allegedly purchased the hacking tool using alternative pay-
ment methods, including bitcoin, in an attempt to fly under the authorities’ 
radar.
You must have the moral compass talk with your kids. Just because they can 
doesn’t mean they should and rules in real life also apply online. 
Your Kid’s Persona on Social Networks
Social networking can be a great way for kids to stay in touch and share expe-
riences with others. However, it’s important that they understand the risks 
associated with social networks. If they share their pages with too many friends, 
eventually they will share their information with a stranger.
In this section we discuss the dynamics of friending online and provide 
overviews of various social networks that are available today.
What is the best age to start using social media? This is a question parents 
struggle to answer. The age at which a child starts using sites like Facebook, 
www.ebook3000.com

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS
215
Twitter, Snapchat, and others really depends. A starting point is to determine 
the site’s age requirements.
Your child should at least meet the minimum age guidelines of each site. 
Read the terms of service for each site he wants to use to determine the mini-
mum age. 
Here are some sample site policies. Twitter’s privacy policy, states “Our 
Services are not directed to persons under 13.” According the policies on each of 
their websites, for Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Snapchat the minimum 
age is 13. LinkedIn’s minimum age is 14. YouTube is 18, but kids aged 13–17 
can sign up with a parent’s permission.
Live Streaming Apps
Taking live pictures on the go is easier than ever. Smartphone apps such as 
Periscope and Meerkat allow you to send a live feed from wherever you are to fol-
lowers all over the world. They’re cool, immediate, and it’s easy to get addicted.
When it comes to kids, their Internet identity, and online brand, there are 
some things to think about before they use these services.
What Is Live Streaming?
Live streaming allows you to videotape from your smartphone, tablet, or 
laptop and have a live World Wide Web audience watching without any time 
delays. Facebook added live streaming capabilities for all of its users in 2016.
Two popular apps are Meerkat and Periscope. They both allow rapid video 
filming and streaming in real time and you can easily publish videos to social 
media sites. 
What Are the Internet Identity Concerns?
You should be concerned if a streaming app has:
•  Location tagging. If they know where you are and where you have 
been, hackers can predict where you will be.
•  Unmonitored comments. Both apps mentioned above monitor con-
tent to an extent, but users have said that comments appear to be 
unmonitored. This is like dropping your teen off at a rated R movie 
that you didn’t watch first.
•  Claims of sexual harassment. Women have reported participating in 
live stream conversations only to have the viewers say lewd and sugges-
tive things while the live stream was underway.
As with many new platforms, it takes a while for operations centers to figure 
out how to block fraudsters, predators, bullies, and anyone else you don’t want 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
216
in contact with your children. A side legal concern for your kids is that, in some 
states, videotaping or recording without permission in a private space can be 
considered a crime.
Here are some live streaming tips for you and your kids:
•  Talk to your kids and lay down some ground rules about live streaming. 
•  Try it out as a family so you know how it works.
•  Turn geocodes for location tracking and pictures to off.
•  If someone is bothering your kids on a live streaming platform report 
it to the hosting site right away. For example: On Meerkat you can 
type in #911MK + user name.
•  Look at your surroundings. What could be used to track your kid’s 
identity in a live stream?
•  Clean up Twitter accounts. Are there geocoded photos, pictures of 
your house, or other information useful for tracking your child?
•  If, after using live streaming, you fear for your kid’s safety, seek help 
from law enforcement. Victims can file a report at IC3.gov, the site of 
the FBI Internet crime desk.
Do You Know Your Kid’s Online Friends?
Parents are used to meeting other parents before dropping their kid off at 
a new friend’s house. When your kids go out somewhere, you ask who else is 
going to be there, how long they will be at each place, and you may even ask 
them to call you when they get there so you know they are safe. With social 
networking, your kids may be sitting at home, but they are going into virtual 
worlds. Do you know the kids they chat with? Do you know who else is going 
to be there? Not knowing who your kids are connecting with online is just one 
problem.
Another is how you try to connect with them. Many parents use e-mail, 
but that is not the communication tool of choice for kids. Kids are texting and 
flocking to Facebook. Some parents who are on Facebook know that you can 
set up your kids’ accounts to send you an e-mail when they post content or a 
note is posted to their walls. However, most do not realize that kids can hold an 
instant chat on Facebook and the service doesn’t send an e-mail or leave a record 
online. Because Facebook makes it easy to video chat from their service, anyone 
from friends to strangers can have visual access to your kids without leaving an 
obvious record. In a speech, retired general Colin Powell shared a personal story. 
He talked about how hard it is to stay current. He used an example of trying 
to stay in touch with his grandkids, and he asked them why they never respond 
to his e-mails. His grandkids told him, “Poppy, nobody e-mails anymore. You 
need to use Facebook!” Then they set him up with a Facebook page. If we do 
www.ebook3000.com

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS
217
not connect to the kids where they are, we might as well be in different countries 
or speaking another language. The fact is that parents are blogging and adopt-
ing social services like Twitter, but kids aren’t. At some point, parents and kids 
are tethered to the Internet, but not in the same way, so they completely miss 
each other.
What is the answer? Well, it’s definitely not the stance of one principal at a 
New Jersey middle school, who feels so strongly about the potential downsides 
of social networking he sent an e-mail blast to parents asking them to consider 
taking down their kids’ online social networking profiles, including Facebook.29 
Anthony Orsini, principal at Benjamin Franklin Middle School, also wrote, 
“There is absolutely no reason for any middle school student to be a part of a 
social networking site! Let me repeat that—there is absolutely, positively no 
reason for any middle school student to be a part of a social networking site!”30 
Not only is it virtually impossible to keep kids from the social Web, but it’s also 
not productive, as eventually they will have to learn how to be safe, productive 
online citizens. Start educating them now about safety, and stay in touch with 
what they’re doing online and with whom they’re doing it.
Keeping up with what your kids are doing online doesn’t have to feel like a 
losing battle. Review your kid’s profile. It’s important that you friend your kids 
and be where they are online. Some 70 percent of parents in one report said 
they don’t know what their kids look at or read while they are online.31 If you 
don’t know what your kids do online, you can’t guide them in making good 
decisions that build good online reputations and protect them from cybersnoops 
or creeps.
G a n g s  O n l i n e
Did you know that social networking via the Internet is the new recruit-
ing tool for gangs like MS-13? It could be damaging to your child’s online 
reputation, not to mention his or her safety, if he or she is linked to gangs. 
Young people who are surfing online may come across pictures, music, or 
videos about gangs. Of course, children are curious, so they click and see 
something that glorifies gang life. That’s when a gang member may strike 
up a chat with them online and try to lure them into joining their club or 
linking to their social networking page. About 70 percent of gang members 
say it is easier to make friends online than approaching kids in person.

Take Inventory of Social Networking Sites
So, just where might you find your kids online? When it comes to social 
networking sites, Facebook is much touted, but it’s not the only one out there. 
There may be one that fits your or your kids’ needs better than others. Here 
are some of the most popular sites used by U.S. teens and teens around the 
globe32:
•  Facebook: The most popular social network that also has a location 
check-in service called Facebook Places. Ages thirteen to seventeen 
make up 10 percent of Facebook users. The largest age segment on 
Facebook is eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds (29 percent). Some 
61 percent of Facebook’s users are thirty-five or older.
•  Instagram: Picture posting site allows you to add comments as well. 
You can share, like, or comment on other posts. One-third of teens 
responding to a survey conducted by Piper Jaffray said it’s the most 
important app they use. Instagram is owned by Facebook.
•  Snapchat: A video messaging app that allows you to send a video to 
your friends. The video lasts between one and ten seconds and is re-
moved from view after the recipient views it. The video will eventually 
be deleted from the Snapchat servers but as we have said before, once 
you post something, it’s not yours and you may not be able to delete 
it. The recipient can videotape the video as it plays and keep his own 
copy to replay or distribute later. 
•  Twitter: A microblogging community where members can send pub-
lic updates and links to sites using 140 characters or less. Twitter is not 
as popular with younger kids as with young adults; Twitter also offers 
a direct messaging feature where you can carry on a conversation with 
another member in chunks of 140 characters or less. All tweets are 
archived by the Library of Congress, so be careful what you include 
in public tweets, as they will be captured forever.
Young Kids: Are There Any Safe Havens?
OnGuardOnline.gov ran an article that noted that social networking sites 
are attracting preteens and even kids as young as five years old.33 Providing a 
safe zone where young kids can put positive online behaviors to practice is a 
good idea.
There are many social networking sites that have been designed to provide 
parents with peace of mind and to protect kids. Older kids will probably still 
want to join Facebook or Myspace, but you have options for your younger ones 
that provide a safer environment.
Some options include the following:
www.ebook3000.com

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS
219
•  Yoursphere.com: Designed for seventeen-year-olds and younger, the 
site offers social networking and features for kids that range from send-
ing messages to gaming. There is a portion of the site dedicated to giv-
ing parents tips and the latest information on kids and Internet safety.
•  Togetherville.com: Parents can use their Facebook accounts to create 
a profile for their kids on this site. The target age group is ten and 
younger. Parents can view and post messages to their kid’s wall. Each 
member is asked to agree to a code of conduct covering behavior such 
as cyberbullying or posting negative messages online.
•  Kidzworld.com: Kids can connect with people they don’t know but 
the site has both software and adult monitors and strict privacy and 
safety rules.
•  helpyourhero.site-ym.com: The premise behind the social network is 
that it transforms kids into superheroes. Kids can connect with other 
family and friends that you identify. 
Parents: Your Next Step
To get started keeping your kids safer online right away, here are a few things 
you can do.
•  Set up your own profiles on some of the more popular social network-
ing sites and make a commitment to yourself to use them, at least once 
a week. Many of the social networking sites now offer smartphone apps 
that make it easy for you to click an icon and see the latest posts, even 
on the run.
•  Teach your kids that online posts should be supportive, not destructive. 
In the physical world, we encourage our kids to be positive and to be 
friends with other people who are positive. We tell them to support 
their friends when they are down. We encourage them to cheer for 
their teammates, even if they are losing or someone makes a mistake. 
These life lessons in the physical world are even more important in the 
online, virtual world. Even one story of deep depression or suicide due 
to online posts is one story too many. Parents must take steps, early and 
often, to avoid hateful and destructive posts that hurt children deeply 
and make them feel that the whole world thinks they are worthless.
•  Help your child build an online network that is connected to sites 
that are positive. Help them connect to people who are positive. This 
is the best way to build a supportive environment around your child.
•  Many parents feel that because their kids are not making purchases 
or conducting online banking that they are not targets. That’s not

true. Their passwords on nonfinancial accounts safeguard them 
from identity theft (more about this shortly) and harassment. Your 
kids need to know how to create strong passwords, how to protect 
their passwords, and how to have overall good password mainte-
nance.
Password Woes
Here’s the story of one child who became a victim after sharing his password 
with his best friend. The best friend decided one day he would log into that 
account using the password his friend supplied. Once into the e-mail account, 
the intruder sent out mean and hurtful e-mails from that account. The child, 
whose account had been hijacked, was dumbfounded when his parents told him 
he was in trouble and showed him e-mails sent from his account. After finally 
convincing his parents he was a “victim,” Theresa was called in to help them 
determine who hacked into the e-mail account, what recourse they had with the 
e-mail provider, and how to get the bad guy out of the e-mail account. In the 
midst of tracking down e-mail headers and IP addresses, the victim remembered 
he had given out his password to another account to his best friend. Because he 
used the same password on all his accounts, the best friend had free access to 
his virtual life.
•  An important reason to not share passwords that give access to per-
sonal information online is the growing trend in kid identity theft. It’s 
shocking but true; cybercriminals are targeting kids. Cybercriminals 
buy or generate lists of dormant Social Security numbers. When they 
find a number that has been assigned to a young child, it’s like hitting 
pay dirt.
•  Cybercriminals love kids’ Social Security numbers because they are 
rarely tracked. They sell your kid’s number and help people run up 
credit card debts they never plan on paying. In some cases, once they 
realize they have a kid’s Social Security number, they may surf social 
networking sites looking for clues and facts to make their stolen pro-
file a little more complete and more enticing to use and sell to other 
cybercriminals who want to commit fraud. Often, families don’t know 
this is happening until their child applies for a student loan or opens 
a new bank account and they find out the child’s financial reputation 
is ruined.
•  A key warning sign that you may have an issue in this regard is if you 
get credit card applications in the mail addressed to your child; this 
could be a sign that a cybercreep has started a credit history in your 
child’s name.

Just-in-Time Parenting
Online parenting is not something you do once; it requires setting up the 
ground rules and then instilling daily habits for yourself. You need to be where 
your kids are online so you can be just in time to help them avoid potential 
problems or reward and encourage good behaviors.
When you are where your kids are online, teach by example. Show your kids 
the positive and fun side of being online. Your posts should show support for 
your friends and family. Make sure you only post notes that are respectful and 
don’t reveal personal information. If you have grievances with a person or com-
pany, show your kids how to handle them in a positive manner. By practicing 
just-in-time online parenting, you may be able to head off potential problems 
before they damage your kid’s reputation or future.
Trust is important, but you still need to verify that your kids are following 
the family rules and protecting themselves and their reputations online. A great 
way to know what your kid is saying online or what other people are saying 
about your kid is to set up a Google Alert to be notified whenever your kid’s 
name appears online.
To set up a Google Alert, follow these steps:
1.  Go to www.google.com/alerts.
2.  In the search terms box, type “your child’s name” within quotation 
marks.
P r o t e c t  Y o u r  C h i l d ’ s  C r e d i t
Here are some important steps to protecting your child’s credit:
1.  When you open bank accounts for your kids, ask to have their names removed 
from marketing lists.
2.  Request a free credit report from Annualcreditreport.com every year and teach 
your child how to do so once he or she is old enough.
3.  If you are worried that your child’s Social Security number has been compro-
mised, you can request a credit freeze on credit reports until the child comes of 
age. By freezing access to a credit report, you stop just about any bank or store 
out there from approving an application for credit. When your child is ready 
to apply for credit, he or she can lift the freeze temporarily.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
222
3.  Select the type of alerts as “Comprehensive.”
4.  Select “How Often.” If your child is active online, “once a day” or “as it 
happens” may be the best choice.
5.  Type in your e-mail address.
6.  Click on the “Create Alert” button.
7.  Go to your e-mail inbox and click on the link in the e-mail from 
Google Alert to activate your alerts.
The Risks of Not Showing Up Online
Here’s one example of a mother who wished she’d practiced just-in-time parent-
ing. If Marie and her ninth-grade son had only known that they should monitor 
his name, they might have avoided a negative situation.34 After Marie noticed 
her son was withdrawn, she kept prodding him and asking what was wrong. 
He finally told her that the kids at school were upset with him for all the nasty 
posts he made about them on Facebook. There was only one problem— Marie’s 
son did not use Facebook and he did not have a Facebook account. Mother and 
son went online and were astonished to find a Facebook page for the son that 
included his name and a picture of him. His wall was full of nasty posts, many 
about people her son did not even know.
Someone had taken on her son’s identity and was posting the nasty mes-
sages. Marie went to the police and went through a long, arduous process to 
find out who was behind the nasty Facebook smears using her son’s persona. 
The police had to subpoena Facebook for the computer network address or IP 
address. Once the police had that, they had to subpoena the Internet service 
provider to get the home address of the computer’s owner. The police finally 
found the culprits, three young men, one of whom had been a friend of the 
victim since preschool.35
Your Kids Are Naked—Who’s Watching?
Often parents are focused on the bad guys tracking their children and don’t real-
ize that there is a whole network of people reviewing, checking on, and judging 
your kids based on what they post online. Some of these people are snooping 
and trying to take advantage of your children. Others have a legitimate reason 
that is relationship based—whether checking them out as a suitable babysitter, 
reviewing their application to college, or accepting them to the cheerleading 
squad or football team.
People are also turning to the Internet to search for information before dat-
ing someone, including parents who may be checking out your kid to see if this 
is someone they want their child to date.

What Behaviors Are Others Looking For?
Some mistakes that kids make in the digital world can have an impact on 
their online reputation and follow them for years. Areas to watch for when you 
monitor your kid’s accounts include those listed here:
1.  TMI: Sharing too much personal and private information.
2.  Bullying: Do they bully or disparage others openly online?
3.  Laying Down with Dogs: Too many “friends” makes it hard to manage 
a social network and in turn, their online social profile.
4.  Mirror, Mirror: Personal videos/pictures that do not show them in a 
positive light.
5.  Anonymous: Using anonymity to pretend to be someone else and using 
that fake persona to post negative content or engage in negative behaviors.
Consider People They Need to Impress
Building an online persona is done in part to protect and in part to impress. 
There are many people your kids will need to impress as they move through 
school and into their adult lives.
Fully 70 percent of job recruiters questioned in a survey indicated that they 
have rejected candidates as a result of information they found about the person 
by searching online.
According to Microsoft’s survey, “Online Reputation in a Connected 
World,”36 recruiters are scouring several sites. It’s important that your kids know 
where they look and compare it to where kids like to spend their time. Some 
fascinating statistics from the survey included the following:
•  27 percent of the recruiters interviewed for the Microsoft study go 
to online gaming sites as one of their sources for checking out an 
applicant.
•  63 percent go to social networking sites.
•  59 percent go to photo- and video-sharing sites.
These are the places kids like to hang out online, so it’s important that they 
know that somebody’s watching, other than their parents.
In a telephone interview conducted by Kaplan, 31 percent of the college 
admissions staff taking the survey said they checked applicants on social media 
sites and 30 percent of the college admissions staff noted that some social media 
posts negatively impacted an applicant’s prospect of being accepted into the 
college or university.37
Studies indicate that at least 25 percent of colleges are using search engines 
and social media to review the applications of prospective students. Rules and 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
224
policies for college admissions vary, and not all colleges are sold on this idea. 
According to interviews conducted by the Wall Street Journal,38 there are still 
many college admissions offices that shy away from using search engines and 
social networking sites to consider declining an application. 
The State University of New York at Binghamton, for example, sees social 
networking for kids and young adults as casual, unofficial conversations. Sandra 
Starke, the vice provost for enrollment management, said, “At this age, the 
students are still experimenting. It’s a time for them to learn. It’s important for 
them to grow. We need to be careful how we might use Facebook.”39
S. Craig Watkins, associate professor of radio, TV, and film at the Uni-
versity of Texas, was interviewed by the Chronicle of Higher Education.40 They 
asked if he thought college admissions should research prospective students on 
the Internet. He felt it was okay, as long as the admissions office did not use 
this approach to intentionally dig up information that was “gotcha” in nature. 
He also said, “It is an opportunity to learn about people’s interests, the kinds 
of things they are engaged in, in terms of community-related issues and social 
issues. In that sense, it does provide a window into a person’s life, and into a 
person’s interests that can be a value to an admissions committee.”
The Wall Street Journal talked to college admissions counselors about how 
the Internet is used during the applicant screening process. Janet Rapeleye, the 
dean of admissions at Princeton University, spoke up, and her input is invaluable 
for all parents with kids seeking to apply to college: “I think students have to 
expect that if there’s anything public, it’s possible that we might see it. If there is 
something that is compromising on your Facebook page, or that you have done 
on the Web that you may be not proud of, you should probably do everything 
you can to get that cleaned up before you get into the admissions process.”41
Even though not all schools have bought into this type of research yet, if 
you have a child in middle school or high school, you should just assume that by 
the time he or she applies for college admission, this will have become a routine 
part of the admissions process.
Helping Them Dress Their Internet Persona for Success
It’s time to start helping your kids build a positive persona that will help 
them throughout their lives.
Pay for It
There are paid services you can use to help you monitor your kid’s activity 
online, whether on a computer or smartphone. Some examples are:
•  Internet Monitoring: Software that tracks your child’s e-mail address 
and monitors posts. Services vary, but many of the monitoring software 
www.ebook3000.com

DON’T FORGET THE KIDS
225
offers tracking of one or more social networking sites such as Facebook, 
Instagram, and Twitter activity. Some examples of tools that do this are 
SafetyWeb and SocialShield.
•  Cell Phone Monitoring: This service captures all incoming and out-
going text messages and phone numbers and offers you the ability 
to disable text while driving. GPS technology can help you to locate 
where your kid’s phone is. There are many tools you can buy that offer 
various features, including KidPhone Advocate and CellSafety.
Having Fun Building a Positive Persona
Although there are a lot of warnings in this chapter, kids and their parents 
can have fun building a positive persona online. Talk to your kids about their 
dreams. Discuss what they want to be when they grow up. Talk about the steps 
they would need to take to achieve their dreams. Create a plan for mapping out 
the person they want to grow up to be and how they could create a virtual rep-
resentation of that person on the Internet.
There are some personal maintenance steps you might want to take to keep 
tabs on and control your child’s online reputation, including the following:
•  Search: Sit down with your kids and use search engines such as Google 
and Bing to find out what information is out there about them. Look 
through the search engine results. Make note of any information you 
would like to make more private.
K n o w  Y o u r  R i g h t s
You do have some support when it comes to younger children that will help 
protect their online persona. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act 
(COPPA) is an important piece of legislation. This is a federal law that 
requires that any Web applications targeting children thirteen years of age 
and younger have parental permission before the website can collect per-
sonal information. They also have to have parental permission before they 
can share or use that collected information. It is not a foolproof tool, but it 
has kept some companies from being too aggressive in enticing your kids to 
give up information.
There are also cyberbullying and cyberstalking laws in effect at both the 
state and federal level.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
226
•  Privacy and Safety Housekeeping: Make a list of all the sites your kids 
visit. Go to each site and review privacy settings and change them if 
necessary to protect their privacy. Make a note to check privacy set-
tings once a month, especially on Facebook, which typically assigns 
the weakest privacy settings by default when new features come out. 
Is your kid sharing too much information? For example, is he giving 
the year along with his birthday month and day, or has he mentioned 
what school he’s attending?
•  Keeping Up with Connections: How many connections does your kid 
have online? Does he or she have a Facebook profile with more than 
one hundred friends? Discuss with your children the consequences of 
having too broad a network and discuss ways to protect your child’s 
information and reputation with those in their network who might 
not be trusted friends.
•  Your Good Name: Buy a domain name with your kid’s name in it. 
As your child reaches high school and college age, post appropriate 
information that would be helpful in establishing an online reputa-
tion. This could also include requesting references, and permission to 
post them, from teachers and part-time employers.
•  Profiles in Search Results: Sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook 
all rank high in search engine results, so be sure to keep these profiles 
current and positive for children who are old enough to use these sites.
•  You Are the Company You Keep: Even if you keep your children’s 
profile private and positive, the friends they associate with online 
could reflect poorly on them. Talk with your children to make sure 
they understand this and help them choose carefully who they associ-
ate with online.
E x p e r t  Q u o t e
As a victim of online defamation, I know firsthand what it is like to struggle

Get Creative
Creating a positive online persona can be a great project for you and your 
kids. This activity might include the following:
•  When I grow up . . . : Have your children search online for people they 
admire. Talk about what that person did to get where he or she is in 
both professional and personal life.
•  Motivational posts: Have your kids find a book or calendar with 
motivational quotes for the day. These can be great sources that they 
can use to start off their posts, texts, or e-mail messages.
•  Subject matter expert: Does your kid have one school subject he or 
she really enjoys? Have your child post about that topic from time to 
time, even if it’s just on his or her personal domain name page or on a 
blog you help him or her set up and monitor. Love learning Spanish? 
He could translate funny and favorite phrases.
•  Occupational dreams: Does your kid want to be a sports anchor or a 
veterinarian when he or she grows up? Have him or her post informa-
tion on a blog or social network about people who are in their dream 
job that he or she admires. Avoid uncalled-for criticisms or negative 
shout-outs.
•  Creativity and innovation: Find outlets for your kids to show their 
creativity and innovation in a safe and nurturing way.
By having the conversation with your kids about Internet safety and making sure 
you are online where they are, you can help protect them and their reputation.
Interview with an Expert
We had the distinct honor to discuss the book concept, including the chapter 
dedicated to kids, with the distinguished Dr. Michele Borba, internationally 
recognized educator, author, and parenting expert on nurturing compassion and 
character and combatting bullying (with respect). She has written more than 
twenty-four books including her newest title, Unselfie: The Surprising Role of 
Empathy in Preparing Children for Happiness and Success.
Q: If you were talking to a parent today about their kids and the Internet and 
you wanted them to walk away with one message, what would that be?
A: You are always the best firewall to your child. Don’t relinquish your power 
that you have as your child’s parent when they venture online. I would tell 
parents to remember four things: Stay educated about the Internet. Know your 
computer. Know your child. And above all, stay in charge!

Protecting Your Internet Identity
228
Q: On one of your TODAY Show segments, you talked about the digital age 
and its impact on kids. Can you describe the model parents who are handling 
their kids in the digital age well?
A: Model parents all have three qualities in common. Number one, the model 
parent is savvy. These parents realize that social networking online, via phone 
and computer, is here to stay and part of their child’s life. Number two, the 
model parent is educated on the newest technology applications and devices. 
The third thing these role-model parents do is they parent the same online as 
they do offline.
You can reduce the risk factors for Internet problems if you are what I 
call a hands-on parent. Hands-on parents have regular conversations with 
their kids and discuss good behavior and what to avoid doing online and 
offline. They do not spy on their kids and have an open policy with their kids 
about how they will monitor them. They are in touch with the true maturity 
and trustworthiness of their kid and her friends and set clear boundaries and 
guidelines that apply to offline and online behavior. The model parent is also 
not afraid to say no.
Another technique you can use is to set the ground rules using the 
word with and treat the Internet and access as a privilege. When you set 
the rules, say things like “When you use your Facebook account to talk to 
your friends, I plan to be a friend with you and will read posts with you.” 
You do not need to spy or wiretap them to keep up to date on their online 
activities; that could actually backfire on you. Make sure you openly let the 
kids know you will be where they are online. Let your kids know that you 
are committed to being online and savvy, too! Kids are saying they love to 
text and social network and they like to connect with parents this way. See 
technology as a challenge to undertake to stay in touch with your kids. Ask 
your kids to teach you.
Q: You have encouraged parents to focus on the issue of cyberbullying. What 
are some of the lessons you’ve learned from parents of both cyberbullies and 
victims?
A: The first thing is many of us incorrectly blame the Internet for all of 
this. At the core of the bullying problem is not the Internet; it is about 
how kids manage relationships. We know that the Internet is a big part 
of our children’s lives. Our kids are plugged in a lot. Without the benefit 
of regular, face-to-face connections, kids may not develop the social rela-
tionship coping skills such as empathy, wanting to fit in, valuing differ-
ences, and respect for others. We also know from research that bullying 
peaks during middle school. You cannot wait until middle school to teach 
important social skills and how to manage relationships. That needs to 
start when they are a toddler and be well developed by the time they reach 
their tween years.

Q: What should parents watch for so they can be alert to any potential online 
problems?
A: There are some offline behavior clues that parents should watch for that may 
indicate there are online issues. The reality is that your kid may not tell you 
that something bad is going on. The trick is to watch your child’s reactions in 
certain situations. Each situation is different, but there are some warning signs. 
Keep in mind that the signs may not indicate bullying or a predator relation-
ship, but it should be checked out.
1.  Have your child’s Internet habits changed dramatically, such as a major 
decrease or increase in usage?
2.  Has your child withdrawn from normal activities that they used to enjoy to 
spend more time on their smartphone or computer?
3.  Is your child always trying to access the Internet when you’re not there or from 
their bedroom?
4.  Does your child get irritable or distracted when a phone call, voicemail, or 
instant message comes in?
5.  Does your child receive strange phone calls, mail, or gifts from people you do 
not know? (A predator may send “gifts” to befriend a child.)
6.  Does your kid switch screen names quickly or cover up the screen when you 
walk by the computer?
7.  Has your child set up other accounts recently to receive e-mail or instant mes-
saging?
8.  Does your child appear nervous when you are using the computer?
Q: When we teach Internet safety classes to kids and parents, the message 
we try to get the kids to focus on is “digital is forever.” Because a lot of kids 
have a hard time relating to “forever,” what advice would you have for par-
ents and teachers to help kids understand the concept that today’s actions on 
the Internet could have long-term positive or negative results later in life?
A: We have spent a lot of time studying the baby years; we know all the social 
and physical milestones that children should meet from the time they are born 
until they reach the tween years. We really need to study the tween years. 
Tweens have a tough time pulling back and pausing before they act. Give them 
small steps and guide them along the way. Take simple steps like putting a little 
message on the computer screen that reminds them that there are no “take-
backs” once you post something online. Remember, you taught them to look 
to the left and the right before crossing the street. It is the same online; teach 
them to take a deep breath, think, and then click. Give them a simple mantra: 
(1) no takebacks; (2) it is forever; (3) what they say today not only impacts them 
now, but it can also impact their friendships, ability to get a job, and ability to 
get into college later on.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
230
Q: Focusing on the positive, what are some trends on the Internet that you 
see that are providing a positive and supportive experience for kids online?
A: I see some glorious trends. We are seeing this generation of kids becoming 
global. They can connect with children all over the world. They learn about 
other cultures, which leads to valuing differences and greater tolerance. They 
learn that kids have the same feelings as they do regardless of where they 
live. If we play our cards right, with instant access, we should have more time 
together. A dad on business travel can Web conference on tools like Skype so 
they can chat with their kids. A mom deployed in the military overseas can 
read Goodnight Moon to her child. Grandparents can stay connected more. [The 
Internet] is also expanding our kids’ cognitive capabilities, with tools such as 
the new problem-solving games that expand our kids’ minds.
A question was asked of high school seniors after taking the SATs if they 
would object to their parents friending them on Facebook, and most said they 
would not object, with many commenting they would welcome it. I think this 
is wonderful. The kids do want to be connected to us, and maybe, by connect-
ing with them, we can build upon our relationship with them and interact with 
them more than was possible in the offline world.

Chapter 11
Turning Off the Lights
Choosing to Be Invisible Online
I
n the past, you may have opted for an unlisted phone number to maintain a 
sense of privacy. Today, an unlisted phone number won’t protect you from 
people who are watching your every online action and observing your digital 
life. Every click, post, purchase, and search provides digital tracks that under-
mine your illusion of online anonymity.
In this age of Twittering, sharing your life and thoughts with your hundreds 
of online “friends” gives you many reasons to consider the alternative of becom-
ing anonymous online.
Whether you post a picture of your latest hobby or click a “like” button 
on a listing for your favorite book, there is a downside to sharing your identity 
and making connections to others online: People are watching. Sometimes the 
watcher is your employer, your neighbor, or a prospective date trying to learn 
more about you. But keep in mind that commercial interests are following your 
every move and that bad guys are watching you, too.
Multiple personas can help you keep some aspects of your life private from 
certain people. You can build personas that reflect different parts of your per-
sonality and life favorably. You can also do this in a way that is authentic and 
genuine without acting like you have something to hide.
What Are the Benefits of Maintaining Your 
Anonymity Online?
The truth is people pursue online anonymity to protect themselves from unethi-
cal marketers, politicians, thieves, and other bad guys, and bad guys use anonym-
ity to commit online crimes. This is a scenario that we will wrestle with for the 
foreseeable future.
In 2014, Apple and Google announced an upgrade of their smartphone 
operating systems that allowed a phone’s user to encrypt the hardware so that 
not even the equipment manufacturer could bypass the encryption. The U.S. law 
enforcement community lodged immediate complaints, feeling that the police 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
232
must have the ability to break into people’s smartphones when they want to. 
Apple and Google refused to make a change to the hardware encryption proto-
cols, and the battle continues.
This battle reached a breaking point when the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation petitioned, and a federal court granted the order, forcing Apple 
to prepare a new string of software code that would assist the FBI in breaking 
into the iPhone of a domestic terrorist. An appeals court reversed the order, and 
ultimately the FBI paid non-Apple hackers to provide the tools they claimed 
to need. This solution to an immediate problem does not mean that the entire 
issue is resolved, and the government is likely to push the phone manufacturer 
in the courts again.
Currently, law enforcement has access to more information about citizens 
than at any time in history. More of our lives than ever before are contained in 
digital files. For example, although some people still use cash for transactions, 
most payments are conducted with credit cards, debit cards, or through digital 
transfer methods, like your bank’s bill pay application. Files are kept on each 
transaction. In cities large and small, cameras have been placed at nearly every 
intersection, allowing anyone with access to the cameras to follow your move-
ments. In addition, your car and your smartphone are connected to the global 
positioning system, and several other systems that can pinpoint where you are 
at any given time. Some people even wear Fitbit wristbands or other wearable 
technology that tracks their location anywhere in the world.
And despite obvious concerns, U.S. law enforcement is adamant that access 
to all individuals’ cell phones is necessary to fight crime and keep citizens safe. 
Anonymity is the enemy of law enforcement. Police forces want to be able to 
map the networks of criminals and potential terrorists, and they cannot do so if 
people in the chain can hide themselves enough to be completely anonymous.
Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, wrestles with the distinction between pri-
vacy and anonymity: “Privacy is incredibly important. Privacy is not the same 
thing as anonymity. It’s very important that Google and everyone else respects 
people’s privacy. People have a right to privacy; it’s natural; it’s normal. It’s the 
right way to do things.”1 While speaking on a panel covered by CNBC, he 
also mentioned that government might need to pierce the protections around 
anonymity. Schmidt said that “we need a [verified] name service for people. . . . 
Governments will demand it.”
Cross-device tracking, discussed in chapter 1, is the enemy of anonymity. A 
website or telephone company may have identified which smartphone belongs to 
you, but if they do not know how to tie this identity to your laptop, your tablet, 
and your work computer, then you can preserve a level of anonymity. However, 
if current trends continue and marketers continue to find better ways of track-
ing your identity across your various Internet access devices, then your chance of

TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS
233
anonymity disappears. Each new device will add to the complex file that market-
ers and telephone companies are keeping on you. When this happens, both your 
privacy and your option to remain anonymous are compromised.
There is a difference online between privacy and anonymity. When a 
company that does business with you online refers to privacy, they typically are 
referring to the laws and regulations that govern privacy. If you hear an executive 
talk about protecting customer privacy, the executive most likely is referring to 
protecting your Social Security number or credit card information. 
The ability to transact and communicate anonymously goes much deeper 
than basic privacy. Anonymity means that you are avoiding the appearance of 
an online persona. To achieve real anonymity as a participant on the Internet, 
you would need to mask your Internet protocol (IP) address so that no one could 
track you, tracking the trail left as your browser moves from one site to another. 
Currently, anonymity is defeated because a site can identify the IP address 
from which an Internet user enters that site. If this address points to a home or 
a company, then the Internet user can quickly be identified. Even people using 
public networks in places like the local library or Starbucks can often be tracked 
because the public network may require an identification card to use its system, 
or the business offering the network is likely to have security tapes from cameras 
in the shop.
Law enforcement doesn’t like the idea of anonymity because it means that 
criminals can cloak their Internet transactions and make them harder to iden-
tify. We feel that you have a right to anonymity online. We also feel that you 
have a right to manage your online persona as you wish, not according to how a 
marketing company or a data aggregator chooses to analyze you. We wrote this 
chapter not to provide complete instructions on staying anonymous. Although 
there are tools discussed here that can help you approach that goal, we assume 
that most of our readers simply want to become safer and more private online, 
so we propose methods to allow you to hide your identity better.
What’s important is that you know how to manage the level of privacy and 
anonymity that is right for you to protect yourself online.
Avoid Identity Theft
Identity theft involves gathering and using information about your personal 
life to pose as you, usually with a goal of stealing your money. Identity theft can 
take many forms. Most often a person wants to use your identity to hide behind 
your good name, to say mean things, or commit criminal acts.
A 2015 Javelin Strategy and Research report found that 12.7 million people 
were victims of identity fraud in the United States during the previous year and 
$16 billion was stolen from consumers. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission 
has reported that identity theft was the top consumer complaint in 2015 and for 

Protecting Your Internet Identity

the last fifteen years. Remaining anonymous online, or as anonymous as pos-
sible, can help you to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft.2
One major risk of becoming a victim of identity theft involves data breaches 
at companies. Sony PlayStation Network was hacked and some experts believe 
that personal information for more than 77 million Sony PlayStation Network 
customers was taken. Though the thieves did not get credit card data, they may 
have stolen the building blocks they needed to steal identities such as names and 
e-mail addresses. More recent famous hacking cases such as those at Target, 
Home Depot, and Neiman Marcus caused millions of consumer records to be 
exposed to potential identity thieves. It is likely that such theft will continue to 
get worse; for example, there has been a recent uptick in hacking attacks seeking 
patient information in the healthcare industry.
Security experts have shown that they can assemble information to re-create 
your identity at lightning speed based on what you, the government, and others 
post about you online. These experts can take educated guesses at your password 
as they look at your Facebook profile and see your pet’s name, favorite sports 
team, and the year you graduated from high school.
Look at your profiles, posts, and pictures carefully. If you have posted any-
thing online that could be used to impersonate you, remove it. For example, you 
can keep your birth month and day on Facebook, but don’t display the year of 
your birth or your age. Many people post their phone number, e-mail address, 
and hometown. The truth is that much of this is public information, but you 
should still make the bad guys work to get it. There is no reason to provide them 
with a one-stop shop for all the information they need to impersonate you.
Don’t Become a Social Engineering Target
Social engineering is a trick of the trade these days for Internet fraudsters 
and criminals. A person will troll the Internet for your personal information and 
then use that information to contact you to trick you into thinking he or she is 
someone who can be trusted. A social engineer may call you on the phone pos-
ing as a florist and tell you that you are receiving flowers from your husband but 
that they got his credit card number wrong and cannot process the order, so you 
provide your card number. They may e-mail you posing as your bank, explaining 
that there is a problem processing an automated payment and asking you to click 
on a link to verify your account information. By sharing as little information as 
possible, you can keep yourself a little more anonymous than others and avoid 
some social engineering attacks. A competitor to Facebook, Google+, allows you 
to set up circles of people, which might be a great reminder. When you decide 
to post something, whether a news article or the latest photo from your exciting 
cruise, Google+ has an interface that makes it easy to see that you are going to 
make a public post, or it allows you to choose circles of people that you defined.

This is a great way to make sure you do not broadcast where you are, or where 
you are not, to the social networking public.
When a major marketing company, Epsilon, was hacked and names and 
e-mail addresses of customers were taken, we waited to see what types of social 
engineering attempts would ensue. Epsilon sent roughly 40 billion e-mails last 
year on behalf of roughly 2,500 companies. That is a lot of e-mail addresses, 
names, and other demographic information. Companies such as the Ritz-
Carlton, Best Buy, and Capital One were customers of Epsilon at the time of 
the breach, and it appears that their customer accounts may have been accessed. 
One of the authors of this book tracked several scam e-mails from the companies 
involved that looked incredibly convincing.3 The e-mails used online nicknames 
and the special e-mail address used for reward programs, which provided a clue 
that these e-mails were not legitimate. When e-mails asked the recipient to click 
on a link and update personal information, it was a sign of a social engineering 
attack.
Social engineers also gather information about you that they can use to 
cyberbully you online. Cyberbullies target an individual and threaten or taunt 
him or her using text messaging, e-mails, and posts on social networking 
sites. One benefit of maintaining anonymity, especially for those younger than 
twenty-one years of age, is that you avoid providing information to bullies. 
Some cyberbullies take over the account of the intended victim or create a phony 
account and post embarrassing photos or other content. In a deeply saddening 
case of social engineering and cyberbullying, Megan Meier committed suicide. 
Her parents believed that their daughter’s suicide was directly related to having 
being taunted online. During an investigation into her suicide, it was found that 
a bogus account was created on Myspace under the name of Josh Evans. Megan 
was sent e-mails and messages by several people using the fake account. During 
a court trial, witnesses said that the purpose of the bogus account was to trick 
Megan, or socially engineer her, into giving up information that could be used 
later to humiliate her.4
Controlling Your Online Presence
When you hear about the site Facebook, you think pictures, videos, and fun 
posts from family and friends. Facebook counts more than 800 million active 
users in their community. LinkedIn is a site for professional networking. As of 
early 2015, LinkedIn claimed more than 332 million users across more than two 
hundred countries around the world and in twenty languages; the site receives 
187 million unique visits every month. LinkedIn has seen explosive growth, as 
much as 400 percent over in some years, in their user base accessing the site via 
their mobile phones.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

Many professionals say it is not that easy anymore to control your online 
presence and keep your professional and personal lives separate online. Most 
people, when pushed to admit it, have a blended and blurred mashup of their 
professional and personal lives online. However, you can define the line between 
the two.
Separate Private and Professional Lives
Because your life is online for anybody to see, you may want to establish a 
division between your professional and personal online personas. If you get a 
friend request on Facebook from someone you’d rather keep on the professional 
side of your life, there’s nothing wrong with not accepting that request and 
sending the person a LinkedIn invite. You may also consider creating a Twitter 
account for your personal life and a separate one for professional tweets, as long 
as you know that anyone can follow both of your profiles and tweet accordingly. 
If you do friend people you work with on a social networking site, you can use 
your privacy settings to control who can see your posts and pictures by going 
to the site’s sharing settings (on Facebook, for example, use the “Sharing on 
Facebook” section).
As a first step, refrain from using your work accounts for personal activities; 
if you don’t, you may expose your personal activities to your boss and coworkers. 
For example, the online dating website, Plenty of Fish, was hacked, exposing 
usernames and addresses. Typically, vendors have to notify the domain names 
when they are hacked and provide a list of names within that domain. Would 
you want your company to see Bob.Smith@ABCCompany.com was on the list? 
Another recent example is the hacked gaming platform for the Sony PlaySta-
tion. If you like to play online games on the weekend on your Sony PlayStation 
but you used your work e-mail address to sign up, your employer might know. 
If the PlayStation is breached, various domain names for e-mail accounts would 
be notified so the domain names could notify their users as well as to keep them 
alert to potential e-mail scams.
You can also create e-mail addresses and nicknames that you only use when 
you sign up for rewards programs. These sites could be breached, but they have 
different notification standards from many retail or banking sites and may not 
tell you about the breach right away. If you create these special-use e-mails, you 
will be able to more easily identify e-mail scams that come to these accounts and 
the sites that may have generated them.

Review your Facebook and other social networking sites. Either purge the 
number of connections or use privacy settings to protect what people can see 
about you. You should also think about closing e-commerce accounts that you 
no longer use, especially if they have your credit card or bank information on file. 
If you are not using the accounts, it makes it easier for someone to take over the 
account without your knowledge or for them to send you scam e-mails trying to 
trick you into clicking on links or opening attachments. Sign onto the site you 
want to cancel and type in search terms such as “deactivate,” “close account,” or 
“delete account.” For example, if you want to close your account on Amazon, 
you must first sign in and select the “Contact Us” button. Once there, you pick 
“e-mail” and then select “Close My Account.” The deactivation is not instanta-
neous, and some sites mention that it could take up to one to two weeks before 
the account is closed.
Stay Safe
You might have a reason to remain somewhat anonymous for your personal 
safety. You may be signing up with a dating site and you don’t want bad guys 
stalking you. You may have recently left an abusive relationship and you want 
to be able to surf the Net and use your smartphone and not have your former 
partner track you down.
If your safety is a primary concern, consider being offline as much as pos-
sible. If your work requires you to be online, look for opportunities to maintain 
Q u i c k  T i p s  f o r  B e g i n n e r s  o n  B e c o m i n g 
M o r e  A n o n y m o u s
If you only have twenty-five minutes to start establishing your anonymity 
online, here are four steps you should take going forward:
1.  Avoid using your real full name online for account IDs and e-mail IDs.
2.  Ask yourself why a site is asking you to reveal personal information for 
your online accounts and opt out of providing this information whenever 
possible.
3.  Set up a separate account and nickname for use on sites where people with 
like interests gather (called affinity groups).
4.  Talk to your kids or other family members about what they can safely post 
or discuss online.

Protecting Your Internet Identity

anonymity and do not make careless mistakes that can jeopardize your anonym-
ity or your safety. In several cases, an error in judgment allowed the bad guys in, 
either because a person was in a hurry and had to do banking on a public WiFi 
or was distracted when she clicked on an e-mail scam that installed malicious 
software on her computer. Plan your time on the Internet wisely. If you are in a 
rush, refrain from starting any sensitive transactions until you have more time to 
conduct them thoughtfully and carefully.
Choose Names That Don’t Reveal You
Just as Samuel Langhorne Clemens used the pen name Mark Twain, you 
can use names that don’t reveal exactly who you are. Using names other than 
your own doesn’t mean you are completely anonymous, but it does make it a 
little harder for people to guess your real identity.
There are two situations in particular where Internet users may want to con-
sider not using a real name: dating sites and sites used by children younger than 
eighteen. Especially for children younger than age eighteen, it’s best to avoid 
using a real name, a nickname used in real life, anything that identifies the minor 
as male or female, and anything that identifies age or school.
Here are a few naming tips:
•  Use a name that is more generic, such as “SmithFamily” instead of 
“SallySmith.”
•  Consider using your initials along with an activity you like to do such 
as SSTennis.
•  If you are having a tough time coming up with a name, try a tool such 
as Username Generator at www.usernamegenerator.net to help you 
pick a name that you can remember.
•  Look up your name or hobbies in another language and use the for-
eign words for a user name.
•  Stay away from unprofessional sounding names or create a separate 
account with a more professional name just in case you need to use 
that account in a work setting, such as applying for a job. Using Sexy-
mama@yahoo.com or Luvs2Party@hotmail.com might not portray 
the image you would like on the job application.
Read the Privacy Statement
According to a Nielsen survey released in April 2011, more than 50 percent 
of those surveyed, both males and females, have privacy concerns when it comes 
to location sharing on their mobile devices.5 Every time apps share your location, 
you become less anonymous. When location sharing is active, your whereabouts, 
habits, and the places you frequent are all collected and assembled into patterns.

239
Each of your app providers or companies that activate and use your smart-
phone’s location information also publishes privacy policies to tell you what 
data they take and what they do with the data. Yet almost no one reads these 
privacy policies. We could decide whether to use a mobile app with full infor-
mation about how our location information will be collected and used, but we 
tend to ignore that information. Reading a privacy policy can tell you about the 
operations of an app, and reading several of them allows you to compare which 
companies treat your privacy more seriously, and are less eager to share your data 
with others.
Opera Software asked consumers in Russia, Japan, and the United States 
about privacy on the Internet. Each group selected Internet fraud as the result 
of a breach in privacy as being at the top of their list of online worries. In fact, 
Internet privacy actually beat out worries about terrorism and going bankrupt 
in the survey.6 Still, how many people actually read those privacy policies that 
pop up when you sign up for a new account? For the top one thousand websites, 
more than one third will offer you a link to the networking advertising initiative 
to opt out of tracking. More than 10 percent explicitly say they will share your 
information with third parties.
Yes, the privacy policy looks legal, long, and tedious to read. According to 
an info graphic posted on Mashable.com, the average privacy policy is 2,462 
words long.7 A policy could take you roughly ten to twenty minutes to read, but 
the time will be well spent.
Cloaking Tools: Anonymizers and Remailers
Criminals are good at being anonymous online. They use various tools and tricks 
to hide their misdeeds and make it harder for law enforcement to catch them. 
But, some of those tools can be used by good and decent people to protect their 
identities online. You can become more anonymous online and better manage 
your online personas, but you will probably never erase yourself from the Inter-
net. In our Internet safety class for K–8 kids, we make the kids repeat the man-
tra, “There is no such thing as anonymous on the Internet.” This is essentially 
a true statement. Given time, money, and the right technical resources, you can 
be traced by savvy cybersecurity sleuths, criminals, spies, or law enforcement. 
For that reason, you may want to consider using an anonymizer or remailer to 
protect your privacy.
Anonymizers Defined
An anonymizer is a tool that can help make your Internet hops and searches 
harder to trace back to you. Activists around the world who live in countries that 
do not support free speech often use anonymizers to help protect their identities 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
240
because they e-mail, blog, and tweet the truth about their country’s actions to 
the world.
Usually an anonymizer involves a third-party website that acts between you 
and the site you visit. For example, if you decide you want to throw behavioral 
tracking software off your digital trail, you could use an anonymizer before you 
go shopping. When you want to visit Amazon.com, the browser connects to the 
third-party website using the anonymizer first. Once the anonymizer sees your 
request, the third-party website takes you over to Amazon.com. Your first hop 
is not easy for Amazon.com to “see”; they only recognize that the request came 
from the anonymizer.
Good people with good intentions may want to use anonymizers. For 
example, a prominent executive may use this technology while researching 
personal health issues. A doctor may want to look up information about sexual 
addictions on his patient’s behalf. A professor conducting research on a contro-
versial topic may want to do so anonymously. You may want to consider using 
anonymizers to keep behavioral tracking companies from following your every 
move online.
Law enforcement may use anonymizers, for example, to conduct online 
surveillance. They can surf sites or even inquire about services online without 
leaving digital clues that could put an undercover operation in jeopardy. Anony-
mizers also allow law enforcement to offer anonymous tip lines where citizens 
can report tips without fear of being traced.
Remailers Misrepresent You
Think of the return address you put on an envelope that you send through 
the postal service. A remailer is something like using a false return address so 
the recipient doesn’t know who sent the letter. Remailers are servers that can 
receive e-mails and then send them on to the final destination without revealing 
the original source. The remailer may actually change the information in what 
is known as the e-mail header address to give a fake source address. If you want 
to avoid being identified by a company you e-mail to avoid receiving annoying 
marketing notices, or you want to avoid being associated with a particular group, 
remailers can come in handy because they move, or remail, your information and 
prevent the receiver from tracking you as the source or tracking your location 
information.
Anonymous Only Goes So Far
Sophisticated security experts can track down anonymizers. Anonymizers 
and remailers offer handy tools to help protect you, but they are not foolproof 
from bugs or from other tools that could eventually trace traffic back to you. 
More than likely, if you are using anonymizers or remailers, they’ll protect your

241
identity. However, keep in mind that you do leave digital footprints behind even 
when using these techniques.
For example, if you attach files to an e-mail sent through a remailer or 
anonymizer, the file you created most likely embedded the name, product serial 
number, and the computer ID of the computer the message was created on. In 
addition, the intermediate machine may leave some clues, depending on how 
sophisticated the service is. Also, if you sent or received the message using a 
pretty good privacy (PGP) digital signature (which can be used to sign and 
encrypt your Internet e-mails, text messages, and even documents), the PGP 
digital signatures can offer clues that will reveal who you are.
Stop Others from Stripping You of Anonymity
Technology is great, but the best way to stop others from stripping you of your 
anonymity is to modify your personal behavior. Each time you click, sign up 
for a program, or join an online community, you are giving up pieces of your 
anonymity. You can still enjoy all the benefits the Internet has to offer, but you 
will have to manage your online activities carefully.
Mobile Device Recycling
Each year we buy new devices that leave us with a pile of digital junk 
to get rid of. Many people like to use trade-in services or even resell their 
devices on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist. You might want to think 
twice before you hand your mobile device to a stranger. When you sell, give 
away, or throw away a mobile device, you can hand over the keys to your 
digital life.
A recent study found that roughly 54 percent of used phones sold online 
still contained sensitive data. Those data included credit and debit card details, 
PINs, passwords, address books, and more. In the wrong hands, a mobile device 
can provide access to your browsing history and your contacts, and may even 
allow someone to open up your e-mail and social networking apps to snoop on 
your digital life.
The best way to avoid this scenario (other than dropping the device into acid 
and then running it over with a tractor) is to call the manufacturer of the device 
and ask for advice on how to permanently wipe the data it contains.
Many people think that deleting the data is sufficient, but it isn’t. Steps you 
need to take to erase data from mobile devices typically include the following:
1.  Log out of every application and delete each app.
2.  Use the permanent wipe function as directed by your manufacturer.
3.  If possible, remove the SIM chip.

Protecting Your Internet Identity
242
If you are unsure how to go about this, ask a technical professional for assis-
tance. We also recommend turning the device into a reputable recycle program. 
Alternatively, you can keep your “digital junk” in a drawer in your house and use 
the devices as backups for your newest digital devices or for extra storage.
Settings Can Protect You from Prying Eyes
Computer and software manufacturers have put several key safety settings 
in place to help you stay safe out there on the Internet. You should update your 
computer operating system regularly, as such updates often include security fixes. 
Similarly, use the most current version of browsers and update your antivirus and 
antimalware software frequently.
There are several technology tools you can use to help you maintain some 
anonymity when you’re online.
•  Cookie alerts: Set your browser to alert you every time a site tries to in-
stall a cookie (a small program that stores information about your brows-
ing history) so you can choose whether or not the cookie is installed.
•  Strong passwords: Using strong passwords can help you protect your 
anonymity online by keeping the bad guys out of your social network-
ing, e-commerce, and e-mail accounts.
•  Deleting tracking cookies: Tracking cookies can be used to follow 
your online activities, possibly revealing the passwords and account 
information you enter on your keyboard to others. Set up your anti-
spyware program to delete tracking cookies.
•  Deleting browsing history: Most popular browsers offer an option to 
delete your browsing history so others can’t easily see where you’ve 
been online.
•  Firewalls: Use a firewall in your operating system or from a third-
party software program to protect your home Internet access.
•  E-mails: When you sign up for e-mail alerts from a company, choose 
“plain text e-mail” instead of HTML. You don’t get the fancy graph-
ics, but you avoid the cookies typically sent in HTML messages.
•  E-mail account: Make sure you use your e-mail service provider’s 
SSL-encrypted option. Many of these options are newer, and you 
might have to opt in to get this service. By using the SSL-encrypted 
service you help keep snoopers and prying eyes from stripping you of 
your anonymity.
Revamping Your Social Networking Habits
Social networking was designed to reveal and connect you to others. If you 
only want to share information with a few people, social networking sites are not

the place to share. To take charge of your online identity, it’s important that you 
review your social networking habits.
Look at what information you share online about yourself and your loved 
ones. 
•  Review your privacy and security settings regularly. Keep in mind that 
even when you lock down your settings, new features and functions 
might bypass those settings. 
•  Read privacy statements so that you know exactly how much of your 
anonymity you still control and what you are giving up when you join 
sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Myspace.
•  Remove postings that reveal information such as your full legal name, 
the year you graduated from high school, your full birth date, and full 
home address.
Facebook’s Happening Now feature shows you what people like at the 
moment, as well as photos and information that have been posted online. With 
this service, even if you post a photo and your settings are set to be viewable 
by friends only, the photo might still get picked up in the Happening Now 
stream.8
Researchers have found a privacy snafu on Twitter in a feature called direct 
message (DM). Using this feature you can send a direct message between you 
and another person. This feature is almost like cell phone texting but within the 
platform of Twitter.
Unfortunately, most Twitter users who were early users of the system were 
unaware that a programming bug allowed third-party apps to read your direct 
messages.9 Reminiscent of the party line in the early days of the telephone, this 
glitch was an open invitation to eavesdroppers.
Losing Anonymity by Accident
Here’s an interesting case where somebody gave up almost all anonymity 
while using a social networking site. A young girl who was turning sixteen was 
planning a birthday party. She set up an event on Facebook, including her date 
of birth and home address. She sent a notice of the event to her network of 
friends. The problem was the girl missed one important feature on Facebook. 
When you send an event to “Anyone,” it doesn’t just go to anyone in your per-
sonal network, it goes to anyone on Facebook. In other words, anyone, means 
everyone. Roughly fifteen thousand people sent an RSVP saying they would 
attend the party. Even though she later canceled the party, approximately 
1,500 people still showed up.10 Now the whole world knows this young lady 
from Germany, her name, and the fact that she just turned sixteen. Her family

literally had to run away from their house on her birthday to make sure that they 
were safe from party crashers.
Account Safety Online
Use accounts that offer https options for e-mail and other accounts when-
ever possible. “Https” stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. You 
may see https in the name of the site URL when making secure payments 
online. Using https for your e-mail and social networking profiles will protect 
your security and, ultimately, your anonymity from creepy cybercrooks and 
snoops.
If you would like to turn on the https standard, you can search for instruc-
tions within the help feature of the site on which you have an account or any 
site you visit.
If you have a new smartphone or digital camera, chances are it has a fun 
feature built in called geocoding. Geocoding automatically saves the latitude and 
longitude of your location when you snap a photo. Several social networking 
sites also allow you to post your location along with your content. You should 
turn off your geocoding or location-based information when you send posts so 
you do not broadcast where you are. If you want to turn off this feature on your 
phone or camera, look for options in the device’s settings. When in doubt, con-
tact the manufacturer and ask for help.
Alternate Identities: Choosing to Be Somebody Else

Facebook uses facial recognition technology to allow your friends to tag you 
in a photo. The ultimate goal is to automatically tag you based on photo 
recognition technology without relying on your friends to tag you. You can 
turn this feature off by going into Facebook and changing your account’s 
privacy settings. Under “Things others share,” go to “Suggest photos of 
me to friends” and edit the settings to “Disabled” if you do not want to be 
tagged by others.

is still relevant today. You can create an alternative identity or ego online, and 
many people do. Perhaps you need to protect your real identity from others, or 
you may want to present different images of yourself online such as your profes-
sional image, your personal image, and your image as a member of a particular 
organization. Whatever your motivation, there are some things you should know 
before creating alternative online personas.
Risks of an Alter Ego
An alter ego can be difficult to maintain. You have to remember what you 
are sharing, what e-mail address you used, how you answered security questions, 
what image you projected in the content you posted, and more.
There is also the danger that someone will link your alter ego back to you, 
which could lead people to ask you why you created an alter ego in the first 
place. Some may not be able to trust you fully again. In addition to those risks, 
you can also find yourself in violation of user agreements because you provided 
fictional user information. Violation of user agreements can get you kicked off 
sites, or worse.
For example, Facebook does not allow fake user names, according to their 
user policy. Facebook and others do this to prevent spammers and criminals 
from using bogus accounts to trick customers into clicking on bad links or giving 
away personal information. This policy has led to issues with people who have 
changed their names, and some people who identify as a different gender than

When maintaining anonymity is critical, a tool called Tor can help protect 
your privacy while surfing online. Tor is designed to enable people to com-
municate safely using the Internet. Tor routes traffic through a volunteer 
network of servers to help maintain your anonymity. Tor came from the 
U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and has evolved over time. Tor is now a 
nonprofit organization based in the United States, and the tool will work 
on Windows-, Mac-, or Linux-based devices. Tor is popular with activists 
in countries that do not support free speech. Go to https://www.torproject 
.org/projects/projects to learn more about Tor.

the one they were born into. Some people have developed a pseudonym to con-
duct all of their business, but use a different name for their Facebook accounts.
It is estimated that, even with such a policy in place, there are roughly 
more than 25 percent of accounts on Facebook that are deemed bogus or fake. 
This matches up with a survey called the “Cyber Norton Report: The Human 
Impact,”12 which found that roughly 17 percent of respondents lied about age, 
financial status, or marital status when they were online.13

Alternate identities can be a useful way to protect your anonymity while 
online. You may have a connection to the place where you work, but outside of 
work you are exploring a career change or want to establish your own profes-
sional brand. Perhaps you have different sets of friends or volunteer organiza-
tions that you want to see different sides of you.
The U.S. military has intelligence operations that use fake online identities 
to protect the real identity of a person collecting information. The Huffington 
Post ran a story about how the military is working with a software provider to 
help their personnel manage multiple identities, all created for online military 
missions.14 Using these fake identities, operatives are able to befriend the enemy 
and collect information to help avoid conflicts and human casualties. This device 
for using false personas is called sock puppets. Sock puppets are online identities 
used to promote ideas or to gather intelligence without revealing the true iden-
tity of the person behind the fake identity.
An Alter Ego Makes a Divorce Worse
Alter egos can help you build a little anonymity across the facets of your 
life. But sometimes, creating alter egos is a bad idea, especially if you are creat-
ing them with the intent of snooping on somebody else. Angela Voelkert was a 
twenty-nine-year-old going through a divorce. She decided that she wanted to 
anonymously snoop on her soon-to-be ex-husband, so she decided to create a 
fake persona.
Angela used another name, Jessica Studebaker, and said that she was seven-
teen years old. As part of her snooping, she contacted her husband on Facebook. 
Using the fake profile, she befriended him. As the friendship progressed, David 
asked “Jessica” to go away with him. He also admitted that he had installed a 
GPS tracking device on his wife’s vehicle. He told Jessica he wanted his wife 
dead, asking Jessica if anybody at her school would want to commit murder 
for $10,000. Law enforcement has since become involved and determined that 
David knew it was his wife faking it all along, and he was baiting her.15 This 
bizarre story of a problem marriage bears an important reminder about the perils 
of hiding behind a fake persona.

TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS
247
Alter Ego Can Make for Professional Embarrassment
Exposure of your alter ego may reflect poorly on you. People might wonder 
why you hid behind the alter ego to begin with. Consider John Mackey, the 
Whole Foods CEO who was posting on Yahoo! message boards under a fake 
name. Using the online handle of “Rahodeb” (his wife’s name spelled backward), 
he was posting positive press about the company as if he were unconnected to 
company management. In one Wall Street Journal report16 it was noted that 
under this alter ego, Mackey would say wonderful things about Whole Foods 
while trashing a competitor that his company later bought. There were allega-
tions that he was trying to lower the price of the competitor’s stock. While the 
merger was in its early stages, his alter ego came to light and the Federal Trade 
Commission wanted an explanation. You need to think twice before you post 
under what you deem is a cloak of anonymity.
There is also a potential downside to anonymity. One marker that law 
enforcement and anti-terror investigators look for when they collect information 
is people who have tried to cloak their activities. If you are using tools to make 
yourself anonymous online, you may be attracting the attention of law enforce-
ment. Police know that people planning criminal activity try to cloak their 
actions if possible, and so the use of these anonymizing tools can catch the eye 
of police scanners. It is ironic that the very actions you take to hide from police 
are the same actions that could bring you to their attention.
Conclusion
When we first decided to write this book, we both exclaimed that we wanted to 
write a book for our moms, grandmoms, friends, and kids. It was our passion to 
help others have fun on the Internet and to teach them the tips and tools needed 
to build, protect, and enhance their Internet identity.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates is quoted as saying, “The Internet is becoming 
the town square for the global village of tomorrow.”17 Your Internet identity is 
your storefront on this town square. You may see news reports about the dan-
gers of being online that make you want to hide and avoid it. Don’t do that. 
If you fold up shop and refuse to participate, you will leave a void where your 
Internet presence should have been. If you let the storefront become shabby and 
overgrown or let people trespass on the storefront, people will notice. If you are 
advertising the wrong things, it may come back to haunt you.
Being on the Internet does not have to be daunting and scary. There are so 
many ways to constructively participate in our electronic global village, and to do 
so from the comfort of your own living room, that it would be a shame to miss 
these opportunities. By taking to heart the lessons in this book, we hope you 
can build, grow, and maintain the most appropriate Internet image for you. As 

Protecting Your Internet Identity
248
the Internet weaves ever deeper into our society, you are now well equipped to 
protect and defend your online persona and to take full advantage of the Inter-
net’s benefits. Enjoy your time online, and keep polishing your Internet identity.
