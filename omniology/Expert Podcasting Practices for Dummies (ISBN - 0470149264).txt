About the Authors
Tee Morris: Tee entered 2005 with an idea: podcasting a novel in order to promote its
sequel. His podcast of MOREVI: The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana went on to become the
first book podcast in its entirety and was nominated for a 2006 Parsec for Best Podcast
Fiction. Podcasting MOREVI also led to writing with Evo Terra the #1 book in podcasting,
Podcasting For Dummies. Tee’s other podcasts include the Parsec-nominated Survival
Guide to Writing Fantasy, Podcasting For Dummies, Give Us a Minute, Speaking of Beer’s
MicroBrewed with Phil Rossi, and “Behind the Mic” for Blogger and Podcaster Magazine.
He continues to podcast fiction as well with “Dear John” (from BenBella Books’s
Farscape Forever: Sex, Drugs, and Killer Muppets) for The ScapeCast; and “Asleep at the
Wheel” for the podcast anthology VOICES: New Media Fiction, edited by Mur Lafferty.
Following 2007’s Billibub Baddings and The Case of The Singing Sword podcast, Tee will
podcast Legacy of MOREVI in preparation for the 2009 print release of Exodus from
Morevi. Find out more about Tee Morris and his podcasts at www.teemorris.com.
Evo Terra: Evo Terra has a penchant for infecting others with the New Media bug. His
credits in the field include launching the premier destination for serialized audiobooks,
Podiobooks.com. A pioneer in the world of podcasting, he’s the co-author of Podcasting
For Dummies and Expert Podcasting Practices For Dummies (both published by Wiley).
His personal and professional blog, FunAnymore.com, serves as Evo’s soapbox and testing
ground, where he pontificates and proselytizes the bleeding edge of Web 2.0 applications
that are reshaping how we define “the conversation.”
Ryan Williams: Ryan Williams is a multimedia designer, author, and bassist based in
Indianapolis, Indiana. He’s shared the stage and studio with everybody and everything
from Grammy Award–winning hip-hop artists to a full band of bagpipes and drums. He’s
the author of Windows XP Digital Music For Dummies and Teach Yourself Visually Bass
Guitar (both published by Wiley). He has also written several articles and tutorials on
music and music technology for several publications and Web sites. He is the technical
editor for Second Life For Dummies and Composing Digital Music For Dummies. He is a
frequent panelist on digital music and home studios at music conferences around the
nation. He received his master’s degree in music technology from the Indiana University
School of Music in 2003.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the life, memory, and laughter of Joe Murphy. May he live on
forever in the hearts and minds of podcasters and listeners the world over. We miss you,
Joe. (http://joemurphymemorialfund.org)
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Tee Morris: Expert Podcasting Practices For Dummies has truly been a challenge, raising
the bar for myself as a writer and a podcaster. I cannot thank Evo Terra and Ryan
Williams, my co-authors, enough for their incredible work on this title. You are only as
good as the company you keep, and I am in incredible company. This also extends
beyond the writing. Steve, Kim, Barry, and Linda (a/k/a Team Wiley) have gone to the
wall to make this title even better than its predecessor; and along with our Technical
Editor, Escape Pod’s Steve Eley, I believe we have done so. Thank you all for keeping me
honest and for keeping the book timely and concise. A huge heart-felt thank you to
Samson Technologies, Abode Systems, Audio-Technica, The Kennedy Center, The
International Spy Museum, Dancing Cat Studios, and podcasters everywhere who have
contributed their time, resources, and passion for the podosphere in helping me put all
this together. Finally, to my family and friends for weathering storms, tolerating my long
hours and deadlines, and for believing in me.
Evo Terra: I would like to thank many people for their help and support along the way
for my sophomore effort, which I found infinitely more challenging than my first book. 
First, quite obviously, goes to my lovely wife Sheila and superb son NJ, for their support,
understanding, and unwavering encouragement through the entire writing process.
Second, the podcast community at large, for their enthusiasm and unending inspiration.
You have all helped to create a landscape and community that is worthy of helping to
move forward.
Finally, I would like to thank Kim and Steve from Wiley for their exceeding coolness.
They serve as shining examples of all that is right and good in the publishing world. This
book — and my involvement — certainly would not have been possible without them.
Ryan Williams: My contribution to this book would be impossible without the tireless
efforts and patience of my fellow authors, Steve Hayes, Kim Darosett, and Barry 
Childs-Helton. Thanks are also due to the staff and users of Indianapolismusic.net, and
the creator of WFMU’s Downtown Soulville, maybe the finest podcast I’ve ever heard.
This book is dedicated to my wife, Jennifer. Thanks for letting me stay up late.

Introduction
T
o put it bluntly, all of us — from authors to editors — are a bit
uncomfortable with the “Expert” part of this title. Not because of
any lack of experience on the part of your authors, but because of
the do-it-yourself — and (perhaps more importantly) do-it-your-way —
nature of podcasting. To quote Daniel Quinn, “there is no one right way”
to make a podcast. In fact, many of the most popular podcasts (and you
can measure popularity in a variety of ways) ignore or break the rules of
just about every practice we discuss in this book. But while there may be
no one right way to make a podcast, we’ve tried to fill this book with a
series of best practices — which are certainly among the right ways to do
specific podcasting-related tasks.
At the time of this publication, Podcasting For Dummies has been on the
shelves for just over two years. While that book helped many people get
started in podcasting, a need has arisen to go beyond what the first book
covers. For many, starting a podcast is the easy part. It’s the Now what?
question that plagues many who seek to take their existing podcasts to
the next level.
We hope this book can answer that question, providing a few paths —
some well-trodden and some relatively uncharted — toward success.
Having said that, your authors are staunch supporters of the Law of
Multiple Success Variables, which we just made up. It states, both basi-
cally and in its entirety, that every podcaster will have his or her own
metrics of success, and that the merits of one cannot and should not be
judged by those of another. Podcasting isn’t broadcasting. It’s not radio,
TV, or any other form of mainstream media that came before. It is a diffi-
cult form of media to describe to your grandmother and likely to be mis-
understood by your peers. Its very amorphous nature is what keeps its
fans and creators coming back for more.
With a little luck, some judicious planning, and the wise decision to
implement some of these practices in your podcasting, we hope to move
the needle higher on your own metrics of success. Enjoy.

Introduction

clarity, dimension, and the occasional example to
topics discussed in the text. While we’re positive the
writing is as brilliant as we are modest, you can skip
them without fear of offending us — or missing any-
thing terribly important. 
Foolish Assumptions
As stated earlier, we’re working under the impres-
sion that you are familiar with the basics of podcast-
ing. In a perfect world, you’re already a podcaster
and don’t need us to define terms like RSS or guide
you through your first time FTPing a file to a server.
We figure you won’t be puzzled if you’re looking at a
wave form for the first time. If that gives you pause,
then allow us to highly recommend picking up a
copy of our first book, Podcasting For Dummies,
where all of that lovely stuff — and much more —
gets covered at an appropriate level of detail.
Beyond that, we assume you are a generally curious
person who’s familiar with the basics of getting new
programs installed on your computer, signing up for
online services, and adapting broad instructions to
your specific environment. As with any For Dummies
book, you get step-by-step instructions where
they’re called for, without having to endure some-
body talking down to you. Of course, in keeping with
the “Expert” part of our book title, we sometimes
start the hand-holding a bit further along in the
process. We figure you’ve already got a handle on
the simple, up-front stuff.
How This Book Is Organized
As stated earlier, this book offers a series of distinct
practices, provided in a loosely linear fashion. Each
practice is designed to be read by itself, with any
necessary and relevant cross-references added.
Similar practices are clustered together in parts that
move (generally speaking) from relatively basic to
relatively advanced. 
About This Book
This book is written for — and by — podcasters.
It’s filled with a series of practices, tips, tools, and
techniques designed to take your podcast “to the
next level” — whatever the heck that means to you.
By its very nature, a podcast can be many things to
many different people. We understand that and have
tried very hard to assemble practices that are help-
ful to the widest possible audience of podcasters.
We cover a lot of technical territory in this book,
from choosing better headphones to switching to
a video-podcasting format. We also help define the
softer side of podcasting — helping you understand
your options for scripting and providing suggestions
for generating more audience interaction. Yet we’re
not afraid to take on the heavier issues, and we offer
some definite opinions on advertising, networks,
and the ever-present issue of podfading (disappear-
ing from the podosphere — yes, it does happen). 
While we don’t promise to answer all possible ques-
tions in this book, we do provide a lot of perspective
for the podcaster looking to break new ground, try
new things, or even breathe new life into a flounder-
ing project. Some advice is very specific, some much
more general. But all of it — we hope — will be of use
to someone wishing to make a podcast even better.
What You’re Not to Read
While most For Dummies books aren’t necessarily
designed to be read from front to back, that goes
doubly well for this book. So in case it wasn’t clear
before, you have our permission to skip entire prac-
tices — or even parts — if they don’t apply to you.
We’ve tucked lots of cross-references into the book,
so you shouldn’t miss anything important.
You may notice a few sidebars in gray text through-
out the book. These are more like anecdotes and
asides than independent content. They’re for adding

How This Book Is Organized
3
Okay, this book isn’t set up like a novel; it’s not
designed to be read from cover to cover, though
you may find that individual parts are easiest to
understand and implement if you read ’em in more
or less the sequence in which we present the prac-
tices. Often a consistent theme of an entire part is
easier to understand if you read all the practices in
it, in order. Or not. Your mileage may vary. Do what
works for you.
Part I: Planning Out a Podcast
Even though this book is designed for those who are
already podcasting, we recognize that some of you
will ignore that advice and jump into that world
right here. (You probably skip the prologues in your
novels as well, don’t you? Well . . . so do we.)
Assuming you already have experience in recording,
editing, producing, or even creating your own pod-
cast, you may have that unmistakable itch that can
only be scratched by creating another podcast. This
part takes you through the process of getting ready
to podcast. It covers a range of topics — figuring out
what to talk about, finding who else is talking about
it, getting a handle on how you should talk about it,
and what to do to make sure that others care that
you are talking about it.
Part II: Going for a Professional Sound
The second part in this book is all about the record-
ing process. We help you pick out quality micro-
phones and headphones — and help you put them
to good use. We offer some perspective on various
types of recording environments so you can increase
your flexibility in deciding where to capture the per-
fect sound. Additionally, we get into some more
advanced recording topics, covering professional
software and techniques to step up your game and
make your show sound fantastic.
Part III: Post-Production Approaches
The audio engineers in the crowd will tell you — the
magic happens in post-production. Unless you are of
the “record and release” school of podcasters, you’ll
probably find that an efficient post-production ses-
sion dramatically increases your show’s sound qual-
ity. This part covers topics in that vein — ways to fix
problem audio files, adding in just the right effects,
navigating the nuances of mp3 files, and weighing
the pros and cons of doing enhanced podcasts.
Part IV: The Final Steps Before Episode #0
This may be the smallest part of the book, but the
practices inside can mean the difference between a
fun show that’s enjoyed by a few and a fun show
that’s easily discovered and enjoyed by many
more. In this part, we leave the engineering tricks
behind and discuss often-overlooked aspects of
podcasting — including proper ID3 tagging, creating
valid RSS feeds, and making the most of your corre-
sponding Web site.
Part V: Building Your Audience
With all the work that went into building your
show and podcast episodes, you’d probably be a lot
happier if a few more (or a lot more) people were
listening to your show. That’s why this part provides
plenty of ways you can get the word out about your
show. Social media, networking with other podcast-
ers, and mobilizing your fan base are all great ways
to increase your podcast’s visibility. We discuss
those opportunities and a whole lot more.
Part VI: Creating a Video Podcast
Some podcasters are naturally drawn to the wonders
of moving pictures and feel compelled to create
video versions of their podcasts. This part provides
an overview of adding video to your podcast, with
enough information to get you started down the
path. Truth be told, there aren’t enough pages in this

book to fully cover making a professional video pod-
cast. That’s a topic for another day. And another
book. But we give you a solid place to start.
Part VII: Podcasting as a Business
Although many podcasters do it for fun, some do
it as a job. In this part, we cover the business side
of podcasting. Whether you do business-based
podcasting on your own or are paid to do it for an
organization or corporation, this part will help you
navigate the waters between hobby and vocation.
Practice VIII: Reengineering Your Podcast
The final part of this book takes an honest and
straightforward look at the reality of podcasting —
sometimes it’s just not fun anymore. Although
(quite often) that can mean throwing in the towel
(we talk about that), in many cases a spark still
exists that can be nurtured back to a roaring blaze.
It’s all about changing your perspective — and
sometimes topics or personnel.
Bonus Content on the DVD
We know we cover a lot of ground in this book, so
we brought along a goodie bag for you to enjoy on
your journey. On the DVD, you’ll find samples of
podcasts, podsafe music (music that’s okay to use in
your podcast without fear of violating prohibitive
copyright or licensing agreements), and a few
screencast tutorials that illustrate some basic pod-
cast techniques. You’ll also find sample files you can
use to follow along with some of the step lists in the
book to help develop your podcasting skills. For
your convenience, the DVD also provides live links
to sites for the podcasts, software, and equipment
mentioned in the book. 
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses some consistent design features to
help you get around the topics and spot the impor-
tant stuff at a glance. For instance . . .

heart’s content in the book. If you’re relatively new

find it enjoyable.
To help with that enjoyment, we’d like to let you
know that we have companion podcasts available for
both books — Podcasting For Dummies and Expert

Part I
Planning Out a
Podcast


1
Selecting the Right
Topic for Your
Podcast
A
s Kermit the Frog said, “It’s not easy being green.” While the verac-
ity of this statement is subject to debate, we, the authors of this
book, posit to you that selecting the right topic for your podcast
is not easy either. The key word in that statement is “right.” We heartily
agree that all too many podcasts are chosen without sufficient foresight
and planning — the collective decision of one or more parties after too
much alcohol, too little sleep, and the auspicious statement, “You know,
this would make a great podcast!”
Well, no, we’re not talking about that at all. The title of this book has the
words expert practices in it, and we’re certainly not about to start off
breaking from the code on the very first practice of the book (even
though the authors of this book have been guilty of the aforementioned,
on more than one occasion). Heck, by some accounts, the story of how
we decided to write our first book together, Podcasting For Dummies, is
eerily similar.
In this practice, we advocate the use of rational and logical thought to
help guide you toward one of the many “right” topics you may choose for
your podcast. The truth is, there are probably many topics you are quali-
fied to speak about, that are of interest to a potential audience, and that
allow you (as well as any co-hosts or support staff you might employ) to
grow and expand. Podcasting is fun. But podcasting with a purpose is
sublime. 
Taking Inventory of Your Interests
Let’s start this off with the most important person in the equation: you.
No, it’s not your audience. It’s not the community you aim to serve. It’s
not even the person who might have paid you to pick up the mic and
start cranking out episodes. We’ll even tell you that it isn’t your spouse,
though as we say this we cast a wary eye over our shoulders, burning
through even more SPUs (which we explain later).
The host of the show is the lifeblood of the show. We’re not trying to put
undue pressure on you, but your show won’t get very far if the topic isn’t

Practice 1: Selecting the Right Topic for Your Podcast
10
Jot down what you like to do for fun
What else turns your crank that you enjoy doing in
your leisure time? All work and no play makes Jack a
very boring podcaster whom no one much wants to
listen to or talk with. And let’s face it, the possibili-
ties for entertainment-focused podcasts are endless.
Look — you don’t have to be in this for the money.
Some of the best-produced and most rewarding
shows are created by people for the sheer fun of it.
Perhaps you are an avid bowler and would like to
share your passion with others. Maybe you know a
ridiculous amount about beer. Perhaps your friends
all turn to you for information when it comes to
obscure knots and stitches, and everyone knows it
takes you half as long to knit a sweater than anyone
else on the block.
The idea is to find out what you are passionate about.
Jot down a few ideas and see if you can come up with
five or six subtopics worthy of further discussion.
And remember that you don’t have to be the most
knowledgeable person on the planet on a given topic.
If you have the passion, it might be fun to take your
listeners on the journey as you learn more.
Filling a Niche by Focusing on
a Specific Area of Interest
Deciding what topics you can talk about is an impor-
tant step, but it’s time for the application of what we
like to call Jurassic Park logic. JP logic requires you
to ask yourself this question: You’ve spent a lot of
time thinking about whether you could, but have you
figured out whether you should?
While we’re not trying to put you into tidy boxes or
for an instant suggest that adding your voice to a busy
conversation is a waste of time, we are suggesting that
you strive to introduce a new topic to the podos-
phere, or find an underserved audience. Yes, you
could create yet another music podcast featuring an
eclectic mix of podsafe music artists. But realize that
you will be competing with the dozens — perhaps
something that you (a) want to talk about and (b)
can talk about while (c) demonstrating that you
know what you’re talking about. So what can you
talk about? What do you want to talk about?
To be fair, you may have had the idea of doing a pod-
cast thrust upon you as part of your job. That’s fine.
Unless your boss has arranged for someone to hand
you a completed script to read in front of the micro-
phone (in which case, you probably aren’t reading
this anyhow), you’ll still benefit from the sugges-
tions in this section.
List what aspects of your job interest you
Like it or not, we spend a lot of time at our jobs,
developing skills and competencies we use in our
personal lives as well. While there is no question
that some of your daily tasks at a job might fall into
the mind-numbing category, examine those parts of
your job that you do find interesting.
Notice we didn’t say day job. The reality is that for
many people with the drive and ambition to even
consider becoming podcasters, the wearing of two
hats is commonplace. It’s not uncommon to take off
the Accountant hat at 5:30 and assume the mantle of
Community Organizer, Sports Memorabilia Collector,
or Classic Car Restorer. These are every bit as much
of a profession as that which provides the majority
of your household income. The pay just stinks.
We recommend making a list of the things you do in
your profession that most interest you, keeping the
following points in mind:

You can get very specific or very broad — you
can always refine or group tasks together later. 

Be sure to include the aspects of professional
affiliations, groups, or associations to which you
may belong. Within all of these are hidden gems
that may very well lead you to the right topic.

Narrowing Your Focus to Make Your Show Unique
11
hundreds — of shows out there doing basically the
same thing.
The suggestions in the previous section should have
given you more than one idea. If one of those ideas
is adequately (and only you can decide this) cov-
ered by a host of other shows, consider moving on
to the next topic. Practice 2 covers a few podcast-
discovery ideas. 
You’ll best serve the current and future audience of
podcast listeners by selecting a niche topic. This
stands in stark contrast to traditional broadcast
media, where the idea is to select broad-reaching
topics to maximize the coverage area. That’s fine in
a world where only so many stations fit on a radio
dial, but that’s not where we live. Go for the small
and focused. It’s where you’ll find the most loyal
audience just waiting for you to start talking.
Determining whether you’ll have 
enough to talk about
One of the perils of going niche is making sure you
have enough material with which you can create
new episodes. A show centered around the intrica-
cies of reattaching lost buttons to ladies’ blouses
might limit your options in the future. However, that
might make an excellent episode of a podcast about
tailoring or seamstressing (is that a word?).
Our advice is to write down the topics and subtopics
that come to mind. Don’t worry — you’re not plan-
ning out your show production schedule for the next
six months. If you can list ten items of interest with
only a few minutes of thought, you’ll probably be fine. 
You never know when show topics will hit you,
so figure out a system for jotting down the
inspirations when they strike. One of your
authors uses a portable Moleskine notebook
(overpriced notebook, claims the second); the
other keeps an outliner application at the ready
(though the first wonders why inspiration only
strikes at the keyboard). Figure out what sys-
tem works best for you. Heck, sticky notes are
a great way to start. Anything that allows you
to collect ideas as they come is good to have. 
Considering whether anyone will listen
Once you know you have enough to get started on
your first five to ten episodes, you’ll want to do a
final sanity check: Is there anybody out there wait-
ing to listen? We hesitated before putting this sec-
tion out there and remain torn as of this writing. But
in the end, practicality won out. You can have excep-
tional diction, excellent production values, and
extraordinary content — but someone other than
you and your mom needs to care.
Luckily, this shouldn’t be a problem for you; more
(sometimes way more) than one person always
seems to be interested in the most obscure things
out there. Keep in mind, however, that audience size
and podcast topic are intimately related. If a large
audience is your goal (and we’re not saying it should
be), then select a topic that appeals to many.
Narrowing Your Focus to Make
Your Show Unique
Let’s revisit that music podcast we spoke of earlier
in this practice. You’ve got the DJ bug bad, and no
amount of rationale or arguing will sway you from
your goal. Fine. Far be it from us to get in the way
of your passion. A surefire way to differentiate
yourself from other shows is to dig into the minutiae
of your chosen topic.
Hyperspecialization
So maybe that crazy idea we had about sewing but-
tons on ladies’ blouses isn’t so crazy after all? Let’s
face it — there are lots of types of buttons out there
and lots of places on which you can sew them.
Different configurations, styles, backings . . . and
don’t get us started on the various types of button-
holes and the related stitching! 
This might seem an extreme example, but it’s easily
ported into nearly any topic. Instead of covering
something as broad as sports marketing, how about
focusing on the extreme sports market or promoting

Practice 1: Selecting the Right Topic for Your Podcast
12
And while we love the idea of getting down to brass
tacks with your topic, it’s not always the right path
for every show.
Becoming multifaceted
Just because you neatly fill a niche with your show
doesn’t mean that’s the only niche you can fill.
(Specialization may be the most commonly offered
evidence of natural selection, but it’s the ability to
survive when the nature of the game changes that
keeps the species going.)
If you’re going for multiple niches, make sure
they are related in some way. Combining your
passion for extreme-sports marketing and
your fascination with button application might
be taking things a bit too far, and you’re
almost guaranteed to alienate half of your
audience — unless (say) there’s some new
extreme sports with some equally extreme
fastening mechanisms. But no, probably not
even then. . . .
Becoming multifaceted often happens after a show
has been underway for a while, as the host discov-
ers “niches within the niche” — and perhaps even
tangential affinities — while exploring the main
topic at hand. While these can certainly digress from
the show’s original intent, they can also indicate an
untapped interest — for the podcaster and the lis-
tening audience. 
Go ahead and explore these side projects. Let your
audience know that you’re taking a brief off-topic
stroll if you feel it necessary. Change is a natural
part of life, and as long as you’re not going com-
pletely off the deep end, your audience will allow
you some latitude.
Tapping into the community
Speaking of your audience — ask your listeners
what they think and where you should take the
show. 
and financing Ultimate Fighting Championship
matches?
When you narrow your focus to specific elements
within a specific topic, sometimes you can actually
uncover more content. Now, that may sound coun-
terintuitive, but consider the extreme-sports market-
ing angle. A show on general sports marketing might
turn off an audience if the host delves into the
venue-selection process for rock climbing to maxi-
mize sponsorship branding. And if you can make a
compelling podcast about that topic. . . .
Hyperlocalization
Even though podcasts can and do reach a global
audience, going hyperlocal is another great way to
set your show apart from the rest. Forget covering
sports marketing for the entire U.S. market — cover
the challenges and rewards of doing the job in
Peoria, Illinois. How many community, school, or
enthusiast teams are there in an area — each giving
you a number of potential listeners?
And don’t think that hyperlocal means that only
local people will listen. While the content may be
local and relevant to those in a local area, the con-
cept may appeal to a wider audience. It’s no big leap
of faith to assume that someone working to market a
disc-golf tournament in Flagstaff, Arizona, could get
some great advice from the sports marketer in
Peoria — even if the producers never specifically
talk about disc-golf tournaments. 
Broadening Your Focus to
Appeal to New Listeners
Strange as it may sound, taking the opposite road —
broadening your focus — can also lead to a great
podcast topic. Often, in fact, this advice can offer
the most benefit to established podcasters looking
to step up their game or appeal to a wider audience.

Broadening Your Focus to Appeal to New Listeners
13
A little of this technique goes a long way.
Don’t use it as a crutch when you’re out of
things to talk about. And certainly don’t use it
in your first 20 episodes. There are few things
more annoying than a show host begging the
audience to come up with ideas. Audiences
see that as laziness on the part of the host,
and they quickly find someone else willing to
put forth the necessary effort to keep produc-
ing the content they want to hear.
Instead of asking your listeners outright what you
should do, pay attention to the feedback they pro-
vide you about the shows you produce. We go into
great detail about feedback and how to get it in
Practice 34. 
One thing you’ll learn is that podcast listeners aren’t
afraid of letting you know what they think of your
show. When something out of the ordinary that you
do strikes a chord with them — either positively or
negatively — they’ll speak up. Pay attention to this
feedback and look for ways to keep doing more of
the things they like.
You can also consider learning more about your
audience and tailoring the show to their needs. If
your show on women’s hat fashion from the 1960s is
frequented by a high percentage of listeners from
the Eastern seaboard (you can find this in your
server log files), consider adding a recurring seg-
ment dedicated to the life and times of Jackie
Kennedy-Onassis. 
The idea is to play to the audience. Find out about
them with surveys and server logs, or engage them
in an ongoing dialogue. Yes, the show is about you,
by you, and should be of primary importance to you.
But surely there is some common ground between
you and your audience, or they wouldn’t be listening
to you in the first place.

Keeping Up with

T
here is an old adage worthy of modification to make it relevant to
the podosphere: People listen to other podcasts more than they lis-
ten to yours. That’s because a lot of podcasts are out there clamor-
ing for attention, and it’s highly likely that your listeners are listening to
many of them. It’s a prudent podcaster who understands the playing field
and has at the least a passing knowledge of the other podcasts in the
game.
But in a world of over 100,000 video and audio podcasts, it’s simply not
practical to try and listen to all of them, though many poor souls make a
valiant effort. In this practice, we not only give you some practical tips on
searching and finding podcasts relevant to your needs, but also show
you some simple ways to keep your head above water when the flood of
shows starts coming in.
Watching Podcast Directories
Podcast directories are probably the easiest place to get started in your
search to find other shows with content similar to yours. Directories
serve not only to aggregate content but also to categorize the shows
listed — making it easy to sample many related shows in one sitting.
True, there may be many more shows of a similar nature out there that
have not been collected by a directory, but we’ll get to that in a minute.
For now, Table 2-1 lists some popular all-purpose directories to start your
search.
Of course, Table 2-1 isn’t a full listing of podcast directories. In fact, well
over 150 podcast directories exist as of this writing. Rob Walch, one of the
most respected podcasters and host of the podCast411 podcast, maintains
a comprehensive list on his site at http://podcast411.com/page2.html.
There are two ways to find information on directories — and they lead to
very different results. If you’re looking for many podcasts of a certain
style, try browsing these directories. iTunes and Podcast Pickle provide
the most meaningful results here; they incorporate a healthy subcatego-
rization schema. Alternatively, you can utilize the search box on the

directory; keep in mind, however, that this may not
show you all the similar podcasts of the type you’re

Browsing within subcategories
On “the Pickle,” follow these steps to search within
categories:
1.
Navigate to http://podcastpickle.com,
shown in Figure 2-1.
• Figure 2-1: The Podcast Pickle is a community site and
directory site for audio and video podcasts.
2.
Pull down and choose from the Genres tab in
the middle of the screen. 
3.
Choose from the list of shows displayed on the
page. 
For results beyond the first 30, use the page
selector at the bottom of the screen.
On iTunes, your trip starts in the iTunes Store.
Follow these steps:
1.
Launch the iTunes application and click the
iTunes Store link on the left-hand side.
2.
Click the Podcasts link. 
iTunes likes to move that link around with new
versions of the application, but it’s always under
the iTunes Store. 
From there, you see a list of categories, as
shown in Figure 2-2.
• Figure 2-2: The iTunes Music Store podcasting section,
with various categories on the left side. 
3.
Select the category you’re interested in
searching.
Depending on the category selected, you may
see a list labeled More [category name] for
further refinement. 
iTunes does a great job of showing you Featured,
Top Rated, and other New and Notable podcasts 
relevant to your selections along the way.
Wading through listings
With Podcast Alley, the results are less detailed
because the directory doesn’t subcategorize. So

Practice 2: Keeping Up with the Joneses
16
Of course, you can use Google to search more than
specific Web sites for content. In fact, Google will
likely lead more listeners to your podcast than any
podcast-specific directory. (We cover that topic in
detail in Part V of the book.)
The true power of Google comes into play with its
advanced search features. You can find them by
clicking the More link after you’ve done a search,
or by visiting
www.google.com/intl/en/options/
You’ll probably find plenty of interesting ways to
search for shows similar to yours in these options.
And if you are open to suggestions, try these:

Alerts: By setting up an alert, you can receive
updates as Google finds and indexes sites, blogs,
groups, and information relevant to your search
and e-mails the results to you in a simple text
format. Who has time to search for “sports
marketing podcast” every day? Well, Google
Alerts does — so you don’t have to.

Blog search: Not quite as comprehensive as
Technorati (discussed next), but still very use-
ful. Because most podcasts have accompanying
blogs where the notes about the episodes are
posted, limiting the search to the blogosphere
can further refine your searching.
Speaking of those blog-specific search engines . . .
Blog-specific search engines
In Practice 26, we talk about why so many podcasters
use blogs to accompany their podcasts’ episodes. For
now, it’s enough to point out that they do — and that
this easily enables some specialty search engines
to locate and index content you may find relevant to
your search.
By far, Technorati (www.technorati.com) is the
leader of the pack when it comes to blog searches.
Of course, you can do a standard search on the site
by typing keywords in the search box. But the key
instead of being able to separate out investment
podcasts from marketing podcasts (as you can on
the prior two directories), you have to wade
through over 1,000 listings — a less-than-optimal
way to browse.
Performing keyword searches
As a fallback — search. It’s not elegant, and none
of the directories listed in Table 2-1 incorporate
advanced search algorithms or provide a way to
“search inside these results.” And because the key-
word you’re searching on must be contained within
the show title or description, plan on doing a few
different searches of different-but-related keywords
to find more content.
Successful Searching Strategies
While the search capabilities of podcast directories
leave much to be desired, you can employ some
more advanced search options to focus and
enhance your results. Some options are familiar . . .
Google
Yep, you can use Google to search through a direc-
tory’s information to get more detailed results. To
perform such a search with Google, use the follow-
ing syntax:
“keywords” site:[URL]
For example, if you enter the keyword phrase
“sports marketing” in the search box at Podcast
Alley, the results show 200 listings (as of this writ-
ing). With Google, you can request the exact phrase
“sports marketing” — and restrict the search to
pages on Podcast Alley — with this query:
“sports marketing” site:podcast
alley.com
And you only get back seven results, which is much
more manageable.

Successful Searching Strategies
17
difference with this search is the way it’s specialized:
to return results only from blogs and other independ-
ent and user-generated-content sites. This naturally
limits the search results to a more manageable list
than what you’d get from using a conventional
search engine like Google.
Google has made lazy searchers out of all of
us. If you want Technorati to return only
matches to all the keywords you enter, you
have to type the word AND between your key-
words. In our working example, that might be
sports AND marketing AND podcast.
When all else fails, look at the Advanced
options of the search engine in question.
Because Technorati limits the results returned to
blogs and bloglike content, you can cut through a lot
of the clutter you find on other search engines and
concentrate on finding other blogs and podcasts only.
Of particular use is the authority given to a particular
search result. Figure 2-3 highlights this listing on a
search for sports AND marketing AND podcast.
Technorati gives authority to blogs based primarily
on how many other blogs link to that blog.
• Figure 2-3: By showing the authority of a blog in your
search results, you can determine how
relevant it is to your needs.
Click to access Watchlist
Technorati’s Watchlists work much like Google
Alerts: You let Technorati do the searching for you,
returning relevant results when its index changes.
But rather than cluttering up your e-mail with notifi-
cations, Technorati provides an RSS feed (a summary
of updates in a special format) for your Watchlists.
So now you can get updates right in your news-
reader! See Figure 2-3 for a Watchlist link.
Technorati doesn’t reign supreme over the blog-
search tools, though the authors of this book are
quite enamored with its power and use it almost
exclusively. There’s always someone trying to build
a better mousetrap (or, in this case, blog-search
tool). Here are a few other contenders:

Bloglines: http://bloglines.com

Feedster: http://feedster.com

IceRocket: http://icerocket.com
As with many of the sites listed in this book, your
mileage with each will vary depending on many fac-
tors, including what you search, how you search, and
how well that which you are looking for is indexed by
the search engine in question.
Podcast-specific search engines
It stands to reason that you may have the most suc-
cess searching for podcasts not with an all-purpose
search engine, or even a blog-specific search engine,
but with a podcast-specific search engine. Yeah . . .
that makes sense.
Or does it? It’s fair to say that the technology
required to decipher spoken-word context is
nowhere near as reliable as that required for text.
Searching electronic text is easy, but searching an
audio file is hard. We don’t have the time to go into
the nuances of what makes it so difficult, but it’s
probably not too difficult to imagine why. Voice-
recognition software is getting better all the time,
but still has much room for improvement.

Practice 2: Keeping Up with the Joneses
18
Using newsreaders
Do you ever wonder how the prolific posters at your
favorite news sites can synthesize so much informa-
tion? Or maybe how the top users on social news
sites like Digg.com manage to break stories moments
after they have been released? Sure, having the right
contacts, insider information, and more free time
than your retired grandmother certainly helps. But in
almost all cases, these information mavens share a
common tool — an RSS subscription tool.
While we’re doing our best to be technology-
agnostic in this book, Evo feels the need to put
forth a recommendation for the Newscaster
suite of RSS-management products. He relies
on NetNewsWire (http://newsgator.com),
the Mac desktop client, to manage hundreds of
podcast and blog feeds. NewsGator makes
RSS-management tools for your inbox, smart
phone, and more. It even offers a free Web-
based aggregator to get you hooked. 
Your choices in feed readers (applications that
read RSS feeds, also called aggregators) are legion.
Table 2-2 lists some of the more-popular feed read-
ers. Many are Web page–based (Google Reader and
Bloglines). Some work directly with your browser
(Sage and Pluck), while the new Internet Explorer 7
browser comes with native RSS support built in.
Many people prefer to integrate their RSS subscrip-
tions with their e-mail clients; power users tend to
prefer to install specific applications to get the most
control possible.

A few companies are pushing the envelope and
investing in innovative technologies to get better
audio-search results. Notably these:

Ooyhaa: http://ooyhaa.com

Podscope: http://podscope.com

Yahoo! Audio Search: http://audio.
search.yahoo.com
The tools listed here search through the audio
files in an attempt to find matching conversa-
tions. Just because the theme of a show is
(say) “sports marketing” doesn’t mean that
exact phrase crops up in narrative; these
engines provide a hit only if the words sports
marketing are actually said in the program.
It’s a good idea to draw the keywords for your
search from among the things you’d expect to
hear about — for example, a sports-marketing
show is a good bet to discuss “two-year exclu-
sive contract” — rather than from the larger
theme of the show.
Managing Information Overload
By now you’ve probably found quite a few Joneses
out there to keep up with — each talking about simi-
lar topics and areas of interest for your show. But
unless you have a penchant for repetitive tasks, you
can easily grow weary of searching, reading Web
sites, and downloading whole episodes manually
just to check out the content. We’ll go so far as to say
you can’t keep up with everything this way; what’s
needed is a healthy regimen of subscribing, tagging,
and skimming to get a taste of the content — else ye
go mad!
Many of the search engines we’ve listed here —
including Google — allow you to schedule auto-
matic searches and have the results e-mailed to
you. That’s a great idea and highly recom-
mended; after all, most of us check our inboxes
on a regular basis.

Managing Information Overload
19
Regardless of which method you choose, remember
that it takes dedication and discipline to manage
your subscriptions effectively. After all, it’s too easy
to let hundreds (or even thousands) of news posts
pile up. You aren’t doing yourself any favors when
that happens; the whole idea is to keep updated in
as near an approximation of real time as possible.
The key to managing RSS feeds lies in finding the
delicate balance between obsessively refreshing to
check for new items and leaving that chore until the
end of the week. And while neither extreme is likely
to benefit you much, every individual has an RSS-
feed comfort zone — a check cycle that fits into
daily life with minimum fuss.
Keeping your feeds from overflowing
When all else fails, use the thrice-a-day method. When you
sit down in front of your computer in the morning, make a
habit of going through all of the news items in your reader
from the night before. You don’t have to read whole articles
at that moment. Instead, save ’em for later — but specify a
time. In some readers, you can click the headline, and it will
spawn another window. Others may open a Web browser
with the page loaded. Fine. Your primary goal is to separate
the wheat from the chaff. If you find a story that isn’t inter-
esting, mark it as read (as in past tense) and move on. Even
with a few hundred feeds — and just as many unread news
items — this shouldn’t take you much more than an hour
to do.
Repeat the same process one other time during the day,
perhaps at your lunch break or at the end of your workday.
Finally, do another pass before turning in. The idea is to
keep your feed reader cleaned out, saving the good stuff
for a deeper dive later when you have more time.
Tagging with del.icio.us
The concept of tagging can be difficult to wrap your
head around at first. Not because it’s overly compli-
cated, but rather because it’s so simple. Many of us
were trained in the traditional categorize-by-filing
methods. While that’s a great way to file last year’s
tax information, it’s less helpful when you’re dealing
with information that could reasonably fit in multi-
ple categories. 
Del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us) has become the
de-facto standard in tagging Web content. Think of it
as making your browser’s bookmark this feature
available to you any time you’re online from any
computer — while at the same time making it a lot
easier to find content you’ve put there. That’s tag-
ging the way del.icio.us does it. Follow these steps
to get started using del.icio.us:
1.
Go to http://del.icio.us and click the Get
Started link.
2.
Fill in the requested information to register for
a del.icio.us account.
Accounts are free of charge, and registration is
simple. 
3.
Install the browser buttons by clicking the
Install Buttons Now link.
Browser buttons make it possible for you to tag
Web pages and other content you find without
having to go back to del.icio.us. Follow the direc-
tions for your specific browser.
4.
Start tagging Web content. 
When you find a page that you want to look at
later, click the TAG browser button you just
installed. In the pop-up window, fill out the
boxes.
Tagging works best when you tag excessively. There
is no limit on the number of tags you can put against
a single piece of content — so go for it! Use the key-
words you expect to use when you look for the con-
tent later. Here are some tips regarding what tags 
to use:

The name of the product/site/service

The author of the post, if applicable

Names of similar products/services

Keywords found in the article

Using del.icio.us to sample media files
Del.icio.us tags Web content, not just Web pages.
With some further tweaking and customizing, you
can get del.icio.us to create an RSS 2.0 feed of all the
neat “found” audio content you discover in your
feeds. Yes, you can just download the audio files you
discover to your desktop and transfer them to your
mp3 player manually. But where’s the fun in that?
Let del.icio.us do the heavy lifting for you, and you
can get back to work faster:
1.
Decide on your trigger word. 
This can be anything you want, but it should be
something that you aren’t likely to use as a tag
on a nonmedia file (that is, something other than
audio or video). Evo uses enclosure and finds
that works well for him.

Skimming podcasts
While all this great content is going to keep you
on the cutting edge of what all those podcasting
Joneses are up to, it won’t do you a whole lot of
good if you can’t parse all the data in a timely fash-
ion. And as cool as audio and video podcasts may
be, they just don’t lend themselves to browsing in
the same way text does.
Not only that, but sometimes the devices used to
listen to or watch a podcast don’t make it all that
easy to sample different sections of a podcast. Some
podcasters use a concept called bookmarking (we
cover this topic in Practice 33); others are very
good at time stamping their show notes, but most
don’t make it easy. 
There are basically three ways to scan podcast
content:

Use software to scan the audio file. We talked
about Podscope and other applications earlier in
this practice. But as we noted, they’re rife with
issues. Most notably, they have a hard time deci-
phering words spoken over background music
and aren’t too adept at picking out proper names.

Keep your finger on the fast-forward button.
Think of this as skipping forward a few para-
graphs or pages. But unless the podcaster uses
obvious transition marks (such as sound effects
or music beds) when the show switches topics,
you’ll be hard-pressed to know when the topic
has changed.

Skip a bit, brother. This one is a little more
extreme than #2 and should probably not be used
if you are looking for something specific. But it
can be handy to give you some samples of the
show in various forms. It’s difficult to get a flavor
for a show in the first two minutes, especially if
the intro is long. By skipping forward and sam-
pling the show at different time slices, you may
get a more rounded picture of the show’s overall
structure and composition. Of course, it’s difficult
to gain any meaningful context in 10-to-20-second
slices, so use this approach judiciously.
Staying Connected to
the Offline World
“There are more things on heaven and on earth
than exist inside your podcasts, Horatio.” If Bill
Shakespeare were alive today, he’d forgive us the
poetic license with his quote. And it speaks to the
truth: While the amount of information you can
gather from online sources continues to swell every
day, a significant amount of information — for many
industries and professions — lives and breathes
offline in that place called the real world. Even for
highly Web-enabled content — such as virtual-world
development and even the business of podcasting —
a significant portion of new developments and
opportunities exist in the meatspace. 
Take conferences as an example. It’s going to be a
few years before virtual worlds like Second Life can
provide the same level of connection you would find
by attending a trade show in person. Cool as VOIP
may be, it’s no substitute for sitting down with a per-
son for a one-on-one interview where you can read
facial expressions and nonverbal clues. 
Luckily for those of us who spend an inordinate
amount of time online, the Web can help us make
real-world connections to other podcasters and to
the movers and shakers of our industry (okay, for
some it’s a hobby, but we’re all podcasters here).
Here are a few:

Upcoming.yahoo.com: This site (formerly
Upcoming.org) aims to expose more people to
conferences, events, and organized gatherings in
a social network style. Event organizers (or just
interested attendees) list and describe events.
Prospective attendees can search by keyword,
geography, and other ways to find conferences,
conventions, and special events that appeal
to them.

Meetup.com: Similar to Upcoming, but tailored
to recurring meetings. It’s very good for social
activities and has a huge user base. If you are
looking for a regularly meeting local group, this
should be your first stop.

Staffing Your
Podcast for Success
I
t won’t come as a surprise that the host(s) of your show should mean a
lot. Duh. But this seemingly obvious statement often goes unchecked.
And it can often mean the difference between an okay podcast and a
great one. This practice will give you some hard-won advice on ways to
make sure you have the right staff — from show host to support staff —
for your podcast. There are many factors you should consider when
you’re staffing any one of these positions.
Before we get started, let’s talk about existing staff for readers who are
already podcasting. Keep those folks in mind as you read this practice, but
don’t be afraid to make some staffing adjustments afterward. Having said
that, don’t let your dreams of success cloud your better judgment and
potentially jeopardize an existing business relationship or friendship. The
main goal of this book is to help you take your show to the next level. But
you don’t have to be ruthless about it at the peril of others. Some serious
thought should be given before reassigning — or (worse) replacing —
someone who’s been with you from the beginning. Take the time to make
sure that your newfound goals and objectives jibe with theirs if at all
possible. And never forget the human side of podcasting.
Choosing the Right Host
While your deliberation on who might be the perfect person — or 
people — to host your show isn’t quite as complicated as the astronaut
selection process, it should warrant more time than you’d take to decide
on pizza toppings. The host of the show will be your audience’s primary
connection to the content of your show, and his or her interpretation of
the topic, content, and/or script will naturally come to the fore. 
Here are some basic requirements for good hosts:

They should be experts in the subject matter presented — or at least
have more than a passing interest in the material. 

They should have a fair command of the language they’ll be speaking,
a general understanding of grammar and context, and passable diction. 
3
Practice

Choosing the Right Host
23
After you get those minimum requirements out of
the way, it’s time to start looking for specific charac-
teristics in potential candidates.
Taking the host’s location into account
We’ll refrain from stating the obvious “success in
business” joke, but location is also important when
evaluating a host. First, the host will need to be
physically near the recording studio or location
where the recording will take place. If the potential
host’s proximity is less-than-optimal, delays will
crop up at some point. Traffic, illness, or just a
general sense of gee-I-really-don’t-want-to-drive-
down-again will crop up.
Of course, you can mitigate this situation a few ways:

Record remotely. We live in a world of high-
speed Internet access. In fact, podcasting is built
on the assumption that listeners are no longer
on dial-up connections. This same fact can 
(and often does) enable a show host to be in 
a different time zone — or even on a different
continent — from that of the co-hosts or the
recording engineer. (See Practice 17 for specific
applications.)

Record en masse. For podcasters with a produc-
tion budget, consider flying your talent in to the
studio for a few days and knocking out a month’s
worth of shows. While this won’t work for timely
or newsy podcasts, it certainly can work for
information-dispersal programs. You can get
the recording done ahead of time and add
more timely content just before the show
release; your audience will never be the wiser.

Satellite recording. For probably the cost of a sin-
gle round-trip ticket and a hotel room, you could
buy your host a decent microphone and record-
ing interface. And to be extra sure it gets done
right, fly your engineer to the host’s location 
to show him or her how to do everything from
start to finish. You put the host on a recording
schedule and then transfer the files back to your
engineer for editing and post-production. 
Sometimes getting the right host means you have to
sacrifice some convenience. It’s a good thing for us
that the virtual world is becoming more and more a
full-featured model of reality all the time.
Making sure the host has the know-how
Does this guy know what he’s talking about? If you
haven’t bothered to ask yourself that question
before selecting your host, it’s a sure bet that at
least one of your audience members has. A podcast
needs a host who’s a subject-matter expert. Even if
he’s not world-class adept at the topic, the host
should at least profess a working knowledge and
show an obvious drive to learn more through the
process of doing the show.
Out there in your potential audience pool live some
real and undeniable experts, and they can smell
someone who’s faking it from a mile away. And
because podcasting as a medium has an active
social dimension, they’ll be happy to let the rest of
your audience know that your host’s opinions and
thoughts aren’t worth their weight in elephant dung.
Transparency is your best friend in this situation.
If your host knows her stuff, shout it to the masses
and don’t be afraid to stick to your guns when some-
one with an opposing view starts to question her
authority. There are always at least two sides to 
any argument, and healthy debates by two or more
educated parties can make for a great listening 
experience.
But by the same token, don’t get caught making up
credentials for your host when he’s not really all
you’ve built him up to be. While your audience will
likely accept that he may not know everything, they
will bail on your show the minute they think you’re
being disingenuous. 

Practice 3: Staffing Your Podcast for Success
24
audience. Often people sound unconfident because
they lack confidence. (While it goes beyond the
scope of this book, there are myriad books and
courses to help boost confidence levels.)
Pay attention to the accent of your host and the
expectations of your larger audience. Having an
accent may lend an exotic sound to your program.
But it might also reduce the clarity of your message
if the accent is so heavy that only a local audience
can decipher the message. Again, this may be a
bonus if you are going for the hyperlocalization we
spoke of in the previous practice.
Regardless of volume, tone, and inflection, you must
pay close attention to pronunciation. Yes, there are
local variants, such as the difference between the
American and Canadian ways of pronouncing process
(long “o” versus the short “ah” sound). But few things
grate more on listeners’ nerves than hearing the
same word — for example, nuclear (it’s “nuke-lee-ar,”
not “nuke-you-ler”) — mispronounced every episode.
It’s not cute. It’s not quaint. It’s wrong. Please stop.
Choosing the Support Staff
If you are the host of a podcast, you might want to
close your eyes for the next sentence: The world
does not revolve around the hosts, and they are not
the be-all-and-end-all of success! Okay, hosts, you can
open your eyes again. We weren’t talking about you.
Too much.
Many of the more-popular podcasts carry with them
a support staff of dedicated individuals with special-
ized skills who rarely get the credit they deserve.
Each of these people contributes much to the show,
but usually from behind the scenes and away from
the microphone. Much like an exceptional sound-
track to a movie, the more successful they are in
their jobs, the less the listening audience will even
know they are there.
If you find yourself in a situation where you have a
host that needs a smidge more education, you have
a few choices:

Get that education. Unless you find yourself in a
real-time interview situation, the pre-recorded
nature of most podcasts allows you do some
(or a lot of) research before you broach a topic
that your host is unfamiliar with. And even if it is
an interview, your host should be familiar with
the guest’s background. At a minimum, go find
some previous interviews with the guest.

’Fess up to your ignorance. “Learn along with
me” podcasting can be a great way to communi-
cate information. And your audience will appre-
ciate that you’re not trying to pull a fast one.

Get an expert to help out. Some podcasts keep
a fact-checker in the wings, always listening for
incorrect or inaccurate statements. These are
easily removed during post-production editing,
but also can make for some interesting and
memorable moments if left in on the live-to-tape
format shows. That works if your hosts are self-
effacing enough to handle it.
Assessing the host’s vocal talent
Your final consideration should center around the
vocal talent of your host. Note that we did not put
this as your primary concern, which will no doubt
puzzle those of you who come from a traditional
broadcasting background. But the fact of the matter
is that a huge set of pipes, while no doubt impressive-
sounding, is not the most important consideration for
the host of a podcast. The listening audience is turn-
ing to a podcast to hear something different from
what they get in the traditional broadcasting world;
it’s okay to have hosts with real voices.
But that’s not to say that any podcaster can skip
setting a minimum standard level of hosting compe-
tence. Someone with a very weak or unconfident
voice won’t come across as very convincing to your

Choosing the Support Staff
25
Producers
You could title this position jack of all trades —
because that’s pretty much what producers wind
up doing . . . everything. In a perfect world, the pro-
ducer’s job is to make sure things run smoothly and
that the show stays on track. Hosts can get caught
up in the moment, and the producer is there to pull
back the reins or gently push things back on course.
Hosts tend to get caught up in the moment and are
very close to the action, which sometimes results in
too much navel-gazing. A good producer will always
take a holistic view of the show and make sound,
rational decisions that should (all other things being
equal) benefit the show overall.
Good producers have the following traits:

Well-organized and detail-oriented. The pro-
ducer tends to be the one in charge and has lots
of moving pieces to keep track of. Disaster lurks
around the corner for those who try to manage
the schedule in their heads or can’t find the
phone number for the guest when it’s time
to call.

Responsible and able to follow through. This is
critical whether it’s a 2- or 12-person production.
The producer assumes responsibility for the
actions of the entire team, making sure the rest of
the staff has their marching orders correct.

Rather tenacious and goal-focused. Ruthless is
another term we could have used. Producers will
tirelessly track down leads and call recalcitrant
hosts on their mobile phones to make sure
they’ll be on time, always with an eye on the
prize of making the show the best it can be.

Rational and level-headed. Things can get
heated in the studio or in production meetings.
And while the producer is required to join in on
these conversations, you don’t want a hothead
in the command chair. 

Articulate in verbal and written communica-
tions. The producer often serves as first contact
between the podcast team and denizens of the
outside world — be they potential guests,
prospective sponsors, or listeners receiving a
response to their feedback. Producers also tend
to draft the press releases and create the show
notes, putting their communication skills on
the line.
In summary, producers need to be the managers of
the whole process, from soup to nuts. Not the pim-
ply faced drive-through manager, but the seasoned
and mature professional who is up to the challenge
of maintaining the show.
Writers
Not all podcasts need writers, but many podcasts
could certainly benefit from having one on staff.
That’s almost heretical to say, given the anti-
establishment nature of podcasting (which assumes
more of a do-it-yourself mentality and eschews the
conventional media notion that writer and host
should be two different individuals). But we’re not
suggesting you rush off to Hollywood and snatch 
up a scriptwriter from yesterday’s failed sitcom.
The responsibilities of a writer on a podcast will
vary depending on the needs of the show. Many
podcasts are unscripted and flow from the host nat-
urally. In this case, the writer’s job may be to pre-
pare a synopsis or executive summary of the topics
at hand that the host can preview prior to recording.
This can work in reverse as well: The job of the
writer can be to distill the contents of the show
into a concise article or show notes for public
consumption.
For the more formalized podcast, a writer (or team
of writers) may develop a full script for the show
that the host will follow. In this case, the writer must
be intimately familiar with the presentation style of
the host — and adapt the work to the individual.
Some hosts will read the script word for word, rarely

applications and you’ll likely see a whole host of
options and effects with cryptic names such as
Nyquist Prompt and Wahwah. Those just sound
cool! And they lead you down a deep rabbit hole
from which some of the more obsessive never wish
to return.
That’s fine. We can use them!
A good podcast engineer will need to fully under-
stand the process of editing, mixing, and getting all
those cool buttons and knobs to do what they do.
She will also need to have a firm grasp of the limits
and capabilities of all the equipment used in the
recording process — from microphones, effects, and
processing boards to the recording device itself. She
should also keep up on the latest trends in recording
equipment, always on the lookout for acquisitions
that might allow her to take the quality up one more
notch.
When looking for an engineer, try to a find a good
mix of these characteristics:

An exceptional ear. Some of the best engineers
we’ve worked with have noticed things during a
recording session that went unnoticed by the
hosts — until the engineer pointed it out.

Obsessive attention to detail. Remember the
last time you edited something until it was good
enough? For at least one listener using some
high-quality headphones, it wasn’t.

Voracious reader. The world of podcast recod-
ing and distribution is constantly in flux as new
listening devices come onto the market. Any
engineer worth his salt understands the chang-
ing marketplace and how his files will look on
the latest (and on legacy) devices.

Budget-minded. It’s no good to you if your engi-
neer constantly laments the lack of a $10,000
mixer that would magically solve all your prob-
lems when you are wondering whether you can
afford to pay your $30 hosting plan this month.
Rather, you need someone who can find creative
ways to get that pro sound without putting you
in sight of a second mortgage on your house.
veering from the script. Others interject their own
commentary along the way; some may perform a
sort of edit-on-the-fly. Whatever the style of the host,
it’s the job of the writer to adapt.
There are many differences between effective writ-
ing for the page and writing effectively for the spoken
word. The ideal writer for a podcast will have a mix-
ture of the following traits:

Quickly gets to the point. Rambling on and on
about the color blue may work fine for story-
tellers, but it’s less effective for podcasts
(unless, of course, the whole point of your pod-
cast is storytelling). Get the main point out first
and then add the commentary. Don’t make your
audience wait for the meat.

Isn’t trying to be Shakespeare. Yes, yes. We’re
all quite impressed with your vocabulary. But we
don’t have time to run your show through the
thesaurus or Universal Translator, so please use
an audience-appropriate language level.

Avoids common grammatical mistakes. Keep the
prior trait in mind, but remember that you
should also be able to keep your tense consistent
and not abuse proper subject-verb agreement.
Rest assured that you have at least one grammar-
ian in your audience. Accurate use of idioms is
worth a mention, too; many listeners cringe each
time you say “covers the gambit” or use some
other mangled figure of speech. Trust us.
Engineers
Talk about your unsung heroes. If anyone deserves a
pat on the back or dinner at a five-star restaurant on
a regular basis, it’s your board monkey. This person
wields an unbelievable amount of power, and can
have your host speaking with resounding authority
or whining pathetically to the masses with a few deft
clicks of the mouse or twists of a knob. Don’t make
the engineer angry.

Designers
It’s highly possible that we have a soft spot in our
hearts for designers because all of us, in one way or
another, have been responsible for the design of
many Web properties over the years. Allow us to
recommend that you pay your designer well and
buy him or her a new car.
While the other support staffers we’ve mentioned
can have rather unappreciated jobs, that’s com-
pounded for designers because they are usually the
last ones brought in on a project — if at all. And
that’s really a shame, because bringing in a qualified
designer early in the project can help ensure that
the final Web site meets the goals and objectives of
the podcast itself. But we’re getting ahead of our-
selves.
A designer’s job is to effectively communicate the
ideas, goals, and themes of a podcast in visual form
through good Web-site design. With the advent of
easily updated Web-publishing tools (such as blogs),
designers can modify an incredible amount of built-
in functionality, in some cases mitigating the need
for a developer.
We don’t mean to imply that there is no role
for experienced application developers in the
world of podcasting. Quite the contrary, in
fact. Our point is that the code that runs
WordPress (the engine for many Web-site
blogs) is solid and can be extended through
the addition of easy-to-install plug-ins, allow-
ing the designer to focus fully on the presen-
tation and layout of the site.
Could your podcast benefit from a designer? Well,
we have a quick-and-easy test to help you make that
determination. Ask yourself the following questions:

What is the single most important thing your site
conveys to a brand-new visitor? Chances are, you
want to get someone to listen to your show. Or
perhaps you want your visitors to read your blog
post, or you have a product to sell. Identify the
central impression your site should be making.

Next, pull up your Web site. How would you, as
a brand-new visitor to this site, get the point —
that is, how well does the site achieve that goal
you just stated? If it doesn’t stand out to you,
you might need a designer. Or if you thought of
three or four other primary goals when looking
at your page, then you most certainly need a
designer.
We’ll talk a bit more about the importance of a well-
designed Web site in Practice 26. For now, we cover
a few attributes to look for when you’re seeking a
designer for your podcast’s Web site:

Experience with editing templates for your
blogging system. It’s not hard to learn how
Movable Type, WordPress, or other blogging
platforms operate. But experience in the applica-
tion currently in use goes a long way.

An understanding of complementary colors.
Don’t laugh. We’ve seen purple and lime green
combinations from people with design experi-
ence. This is easy to verify — ask to see exam-
ples of their prior work.

Ability to work independently. For even the
largest podcasting property, the design team will
likely consist of a small group — as in, less than
two. In that environment, designers need to be
able to handle most things on their own without
requiring a lot of input.

Ability to adapt quickly. As previously men-
tioned and likely to be mentioned again, things
are moving pretty quickly. Your designer should
be able to put up an idea and then make the
changes necessary if and when things don’t go
as planned.

Understanding of what makes a site search-
engine-friendly. We don’t have the space to
cover all the ways of making your Web site
search-engine-friendly. However, we will tell you
that Google and other search engines have the
potential to bring you the most traffic — if the
person responsible for creating and maintaining
your site follows some basic parameters of site
design.

Production assistant: If your engineer is working
overtime — especially if you do lots of remote
interviews or segments — bring on a production
assistant. Many PAs work on the cheap just to
learn from an experienced engineer.

Public relations coordinator: Depending on
how often you produce a podcast or how many
podcasts you are responsible for, your producer
could be busy tracking down guests and decid-
ing on show topics. Rather than letting commu-
nication with the public slip, find a PR person to
take care of press releases and handle much of
the show-created communication.

Advertising sales: Notice how this is last on the
list? That’s by design. There are plenty of things
you need to worry about before hiring someone
to make sales for you. But if you have those bases
covered, a dedicated person pounding the pave-
ment and making cold calls can sure make the dif-
ference in the revenue stream for your show.
Send your designer to http://cre8asite
forums.com for a crash course in search
engine optimization. And have her keep going
back; the state of the art changes all the time.
Other roles
We’ve covered the most important roles in your
podcasting organization. There’s nothing stopping
you from rolling several of those roles into the same
person. In fact, it’s pretty common for the producer
to double as the host, and for the engineer and the
designer to be the same person. You have to work
within a budget of some sort, so make your deci-
sions accordingly.
Assuming you have more money to pour into this
than we do, there are a few other roles you may con-
sider adding in the future:

Personal assistant: Depending on how much
travel or coordination is required, assistants can
be helpful to both show hosts and producers.

Podcast Studio
Considerations
T
ake a look at your recording environment. Does it foster a sense of
professionalism? Is it inspirational to your craft and/or set up to
help forward your career? Most would agree that the workplace
has a significant impact on the final product. Where you produce your
podcast is no different. You need a dedicated podcasting studio, plain
and simple. 
As you’ll find out in this practice, studios can and do come in all shapes
and sizes. We’ll walk you through some things to keep in mind as you
start planning, as well as cover some of the innovative ways your fellow
podcasters have approached various real-world limitations. We’ll also
give you a quick overview of equipment choices and soundproofing
ideas, though those topics (and more) get more detailed treatment later
on in the book.
Designing a Studio with Built-in Flexibility
We’re working on the assumption that you don’t already have a fully
stocked and staffed audio-production facility at your disposal.
Furthermore, we’re going to assume that this podcast studio you’re
putting together will need to serve more than one purpose. To that end,
your converted space will have to fit a variety of needs — for podcasting
as well as other activities.
Planning for hosts or guests
Many podcasters start out their careers solo. At that point, a decent
headset microphone and a laptop computer mean that the world is your
studio — giving you the ultimate in flexibility and convenience. While
others lament their microphone choice or latest aural enhancer, you sit
back in puzzlement because everything you need is right there in front of
you, often for free.
But that all changes the minute you decide to add someone else to the
mix. What are you to do? Share a headset? The addition of a co-host or a
guest is the most compelling reason podcasters decide to build a studio.

It’s hard to plan for every possible turn of events,
but you can be smart about your purchases. Start
by making sure that the new gizmo works with your
existing equipment and your work flow. In late 2006,
mixers that integrated to computers via FireWire (as

As you set up your studio, consider what else
you might do with your investment other than
podcasting.
Huh? Yeah, that bears restating.
It’s possible to find creative ways to offset some of
the costs of your equipment by selling your services
to those willing to pay. Now, we’re not suggesting
that you’ll be in a “if you build it, they will come” sit-
uation. Far from it. Selling your services in audio
production, editing, voiceover work, or (for that
matter) any other line of work takes time, energy,
and connections. But it is a possibility — and one
way to help pay off those future equipment 
investments.

Podcasting from a Room in 
Your Home
You’ve been doing a lot of pre-planning for your
podcast at this point. The support staff is in place.
Your hosts are all geared up for your podcast’s topic
(or topics), and your current rig stands poised and
ready to record. It’s all about upping your game,
right?
In order to capture audio from more than one micro-
phone at a time, you need a mixer. Mixers allow you
to plug in and blend the sound from more than one
input, sending this mixed audio signal to your com-
puter or other recording device. You can get more
information on selecting mixers in Part II of this
book. For now, we’ll look at it holistically.
If you plan on having guests or co-hosts on the
show, consider the fact that you may want to bring
in more than one guest or host at a time — and not
too far off in the future. And while you can save
money by buying a cheap two-channel mixer, how
long will that last you? Good quality multichannel
mixers can be found for a few hundred dollars, so
make sure you buy equipment that will handle the
additional inputs when you decide to do more with
your show.
Investing in gear that will serve you 
well today — and tomorrow
Acquiring new podcasting equipment is a disease
with no cure. (Well, other than bankruptcy and
threats of divorce. The mere thought of these can
be a significant deterrent.) Regardless, there will
come a day when you will want the latest and great-
est gizmo that’ll make you sound like James Earl
Jones or Terry Gross — pick your poison.
To our concept of flexibility, make sure the things
you buy are not only compatible with one another,
but also don’t take you down a road that limits your
choices in the future. Yes, that $200 plug-and-play
USB microphone may fit your needs right now, but
it’s totally worthless the minute you start using a
mixer with no USB inputs. Oops. Money down the
drain. Be careful.
Don’t get us wrong. We have nothing against
using USB microphones. But it’s hard —
bordering on the impossible — to get multiple
USB mics recording on a single system simul-
taneously. For all practical purposes, it takes
a mixer and conventional microphones 
(non-USB) to get more than one mic input
recording at the same time.

Then you suddenly take a look around your audio
equipment. You have upped your game but haven’t
thought at all about the studio itself. You need to
decide where the studio will be located, consider
what kind of surrounding noise you’ll be dealing
with, and think about what you can do to make the
most of a good (or bad) situation.
So, how do you improve your studio without major
redecoration? Can you tear down a wall and remodel
your house to accommodate your audio setup? Well,
if you are Podholes’ Michael R. Mennenga, you can
tear down, remodel, rewire, and customize your
home to meet your acoustical needs. (And yes, Mike
hires himself out for this kind of contract work.)
However, if you cannot fly Mennenga out to where
you live and put him up for a few months while he
tears your house apart and you explain to your sig-
nificant other or landlord, “But it’s for my podcast!”
then we’ve got a few options (along with pros and
cons) for you to consider.
Studio in the upstairs office
At the time of writing this, the audio sanctuary of
Imagine That! Studios is located on the second floor
of Tee’s house. It’s not a bad location — you can
always clear your head with a moment or two of 
staring out the window, and keep an eye on outside
traffic, weather, and any foot traffic that might be
making noise. 
Here are some of the advantages of setting up shop
upstairs:

No concern for foot traffic on the home’s main
floor

View of the outside world so you can pause in
time to avoid heavy traffic noise

Ease of access between bedroom and studio
Here are some of the disadvantages:

Heavy ground and air traffic are easily picked up
by microphones.

Air-conditioning vents contribute to ambient
noise.

Noise from other rooms on the floor (television,
music, children, thundering herds of elephants)
is easily picked up by microphones.

Soundproofing tiles are difficult to mount because
wall studs may not be in the best locations.
It makes practical sense to turn your home office
into your recording studio — and there’s nothing
wrong with that — but when upgrading and updat-
ing your studio, you will notice more ambient noise
around your setup and will want to consider the
advantages and disadvantages you face. 
A second floor studio can be great if it’s just down
the hall from the bedroom — spend a night editing,
stumble down the hallway, and fall into bed. Easy.
But if your house is located only a block away from
(say) abundant noise sources as an elementary
school, a home day-care across the street, or air
traffic from nearby airports, you have to face long
pauses while recording and lots of post-editing.
(This is the voice of experience speaking.)
Studio in the basement
The studio home of the Billibub Baddings podcast
recently moved downstairs to a finished basement.
The subterranean studio is a popular option with
podcasters like Phil Rossi (Crescent, Filling the
Page). Ducking underground to avoid noise has
some practical appeal.
However, the basement studio is not always the
magical answer to achieving a pro-studio sound at
home.
First, here’s a rundown of the advantages:

Cooler temperatures mean less wear and
tear and a better environment for your audio
equipment.

The foundation of the house creates insulation
from most outside traffic noise.

Practice 4: Podcast Studio Considerations

you’re recording in a house and can customize it to
meet your audio-recording needs. But what if you’re
podcasting from an apartment or you’re constantly
on the go? How can you improve the sound quality
of your recording when you’re working in a living
environment owned by someone else?
Podcasting in a closet
The force of nature that is Scott Sigler (EarthCore,
Ancestor, and many others) brought podcast novels
to new media heights when he was featured in The
New York Times. This article also revealed one of
Scott’s podcasting secrets (and quickly became a
far-too-overdone punch line to a far-too-obvious
joke): Scott Sigler records his heavy-metal-steel-
tipped-boot-across-the-throat splatter fiction . . .
from his apartment’s walk-in closet. 
It may appear a little odd being surrounded by your
wardrobe and speaking into a microphone propped
in the midst of shoes, underwear, and sweatshirts,
but what Scott is doing is an old broadcasting trick:
The fabric surrounding Scott works like an insulator,
absorbing much of the ambient noise. Perhaps, on
rare occasions, you might pick up the passing ambu-
lance or air vent kicking in, but you can cut out
what’s happening around you by podcasting from a
closet. 
This kind of podcasting setup works best for the
solo podcaster. If the closet is wide enough, you
could try for a two-person cast, but the space limita-
tions of an in-the-closet podcast will work against
you. However, if you’re working solo, perhaps the
closet is the best place for you and your podcast to
record from.
Podcasting to the blanket
Another couple in the podosphere who are synony-
mous with the words podcast and top-notch
productions — Paul Fischer and Martha Holloway
of Dancing Cut Studios — make the most of their
townhome studio. With an extra room converted to
house their recording facilities, Paul and Martha
face the challenge of working in a room with a lot of

The foundation of the house and surrounding
property assist in deadening room noise.

A concrete foundation offers more options for
soundproofing tiles.

A/C vents create less to no noise (depending on
their design).
Next, consider the disadvantages:

All in-house traffic, both on floors and in stair-
wells, can be picked up by microphones.

Some A/C vents are direct shafts between a
room and the downstairs area, allowing all noise
directly outside the room to filter in. 

Studio location. (Long walks topside to the bed-
room, bathroom, and so on.)
Some of the disadvantages may seem trivial, but
they will play a factor in the overall quality of your
podcast’s sound.
A different kind of floor for your studio
You may hear some audiophiles and sound engineers refer
to something in a studio called a noise floor. A studio’s
recording quality is judged by how “low a floor” is achieved.
The “floor,” in this case, is how much ambient noise is left
after you’ve filtered out every stray sound that you possibly
can, and all that remains is the audio produced by voice,
instruments, or both. A recording studio, for example, will
have an extremely low floor on account of soundproofing
tiles, construction, and door seals, isolating all outside noise.
A stadium where a concert takes place will not have a noise
floor of any kind on account of all the ambient noise, echo,
and other acoustic junk bouncing around. When you
upgrade your home studio, try to reduce the noise in your
room as much as possible before recording. This will help
you create a close-to-studio-quality sound for your podcast
from home.
Unconventional Options for
Your Studio

echo. Sure, they could try remodeling this room, 
but because their townhome is the end section of a
row of other townhomes, the neighbors probably
wouldn’t appreciate that. What to do?
With a few hooks secured high into the wall and a
strong wire suspended between them, Paul and
Martha record episodes with a large blanket sus-
pended in front of a window. Because they and their
Serve It Cold vocal talent direct their voices into
such a heavy, thick fabric, the noise surrounding
them is dramatically reduced. 
And if they happen to have house guests, their
improvised acoustic tile is released from the hooks
and returned to its normal duties (keeping their
friends warm).
Podcasting in the great outdoors
Romance author Mary Winter decided the best thing
to do about her ambient noise is nothing at all.
Her podcast, Seasons of Passion (http://podcasts.
marywinter.com), is recorded at her home, and if
the weather is suitable, she records it out on the
patio of her home. In the background, you hear
birds chirping, a spring breeze rustling through 
the trees, and perhaps any nearby traffic from her
neighborhood. 
While some podcasters strive to reach a studio-
quality noise floor with their podcasts, Mary has
chosen a casual setting for her podcast. The ambient
noise of the outdoors establishes a more intimate
setting for her listeners, as if they truly are sitting
with her on the deck or porch of her home, talking
about the craft of writing and just how tough it is to
write romance. This disarming approach to podcast-
ing provides not only a terrific atmosphere for your
show, but also an easy solution to ambient noise
creeping into your audio. 
Sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to
simply make it part of the show.
Although recording outside or allowing the
ambient noise to become a co-host in your
production is a very cost-effective way to han-
dle excess sound, make sure your podcast
lends itself to this approach. If you’re produc-
ing a podcast novel, an audio drama, or an
independent music show, the background
noise may become more of a distraction than
an asset. Whether it’s an air-conditioning 
system, your computer, or a busy plaza 
somewhere in your hometown or city, the
podcast — unless intended as a soundseeing
tour — is supposed to be about you and your
message. Make sure the background doesn’t
garble that message.
Customizing your space, whether in a house or
apartment, is easy so long as you’re creative in how
you solve ambient noise issues. Some of the solu-
tions you come up with for your podcast may be per-
manent, quick and temporary, or thrown together
like something out of a MacGyver episode. However
you solve noise issues with your studio, make sure
the solution — whether happening in recording or in
post-production — works for you and your podcast.
A Professional Look for 
a Professional Sound
A handful of podcasters — Draco Vista Studios, This
Week in Tech, Tiki Bar TV — work in a studio environ-
ment. Most podcasters are home-studio audiophiles,
surprising even the full-time audio and video profes-
sionals with the quality of their results. The efficiency
and quality of your studio, however, rests on your
overall podcasting and recording environment.
Tidiness in the studio
Okay, we should be practicing what we preach here.
This practice was typed in a studio that was a com-
plete and utter disaster area — stuff strewn across

Practice 4: Podcast Studio Considerations
34
Then you look around you at the previously
described studio.
“Ah,” you say, “but I took your advice and now my
studio is in tip-top shape! Everything has a place.
I’m organized. I’m all set to podcast guests.”
Great. How about the rest of the house? Ack.
Anyone who’s a parent knows of the continuing and
seemingly eternal struggle to keep the house in
some semblance of order. Toys (for example) seem
to take on a life of their own and migrate every-
where in the home (and that’s not even counting
things harried grownups set down on any available
surface). So before you agree to host in-studio
guests or invite others to record from your home
office’s podcasting rig, assess — and clear — the
home environment around the home office.
Of course you know that the concept of children
doesn’t just include the human kind. Are the dog’s
chew toys put away? Has the catnip been vacuumed
out of the carpet? How’s that fishbowl looking?
It doesn’t matter what kinds of wee ones are wan-
dering around the house, you’ll want to dismantle
the obstacle course in the surrounding environment
of your home studio. And if guests are coming by
the home, treat them with care and hospitality. Make
them feel welcome and (most importantly) at home.
Studio at the ready
A prepared studio means a bit more than just having
everything organized and put away. It also means
having a podcasting setup ready to go.
When podcasting pals swing by Tee’s place, he’s usu-
ally expecting them. This means the house looks pre-
sentable, the studio looks presentable (most of the
time), and the podcaster looks presentable (most of
the time). Spontaneous podcasting usually isn’t the
order of the day, but when the offer is made, it’s up
the stairs to the studio to set up for recording.
There’s the checking of levels, the tweaking of mic
positions, and a final “Mic check, one, two . . .” before
the desk, stuff in the guest office chair, and a few
bulky odds and ends forming an obstacle course
from the office door to the computer, as shown in
Figure 4-1.
• Figure 4-1: Try to avoid letting your studio get this
disorganized.
Truth be told, this kind of disorder drives us crazy. 
Now, let’s say we’re recording and need a sound
effect from a specific CD or perhaps a reminder of
exactly what to cover today in the podcast. As we
rummage through the various piles of stuff around
us, we hear one of the most unnerving sounds in the
universe: something (no idea what) sliding off and
landing somewhere other than where we last put it.
Chances are, whatever slid out of view will be some-
thing we’re going to need later on in the recording
and editing day. That’s just Murphy’s Law.
George Carlin says it best: “Find a place for your
stuff.” An organized and clean recording environ-
ment will actually make it easier for you to accom-
plish what you need to do for your podcast.
Tidiness in the home
So let’s say that you have an interview show concern-
ing business technology, and you’ve found out that
Leo Laporte (the biz-tech podcast maven) has heard
your podcast, knows you’re in the area, and would
love to appear on your show. Pretty exciting, huh?
He’s even agreed to an in-studio interview. Fantastic!

hitting Record. (Note the absence of several interme-
diate steps such as: Trip over the dog’s bed, just miss
catching a toppling stack of assorted CDs, fumble
around in a tangle of unplugged cables . . . you get the
idea. Somebody got the place ready beforehand.)
When guests are coming over specifically for pod-
casting, it makes the experience all the better if your
recording setup is ready to go:

If you’re using a mixer, have it on standby
with mics already plugged into their respective
channels. 

Depending on how many voices are coming into
your studio, give some thought to exactly where
those guests will sit and how the mics will be
positioned.
These details may seem like common sense, but if
you’re podcasting solo (or with a regular co-host),
it’s all too easy to take your setup for granted. By
the time your guests reach the mic, you should have
cables plugged in, tripods positioned (for the most
part), and an open space around their mics for
scripts, memo pads for any on-the-spot note-taking,
or beverages . . . particularly if it’s a beercast,
winecast, or scotchcast.
Make sure that if you’re expecting a night of record-
ing, your studio is expecting it too. Be ready to
record and be situated for guests. A little prepara-
tion makes for a more relaxed and professional set-
ting for your guests and yourself.
When you’re shopping for studio furniture,
remember that many office sets are easily cus-
tomizable. If you find a desk set available in
various components, see if an extension is
available. If you’re upgrading your studio, you
can also upgrade your studio furniture with an
extension that lends itself to a recording area
for guests.

F
ormats. Scripts. Formulas. It’s enough to make many podcasters dash
for the torches and pitchforks, ready to shout, “Death to the confines
of traditional media!” as they storm the castle. Relax, enraged mob;
we’re not suggesting that you fall prey to the tyranny of the radio-show-
format clock, the vile 3:05-minute broadcast-friendly song, or the servitude
of sticking 15 minutes of commercials in with 45 minutes of content.
Forget all the negative things you’ve heard about formatting from your
anarchistic podcasting buddies. Contrary to popular belief, having a for-
mat is a Good Thing. And (surprising as it may sound) some of the most
loose-sounding podcasts are planned to sound that way. For this prac-
tice, we show you how to apply solid formatting applications to your
podcast (with the finesse to make them transparent) so you can stop
worrying about the clock and stay focused on your topic at hand.
Of Intros and Outros
All good podcasts have a beginning and an end. This helps everyone
know when the show is starting and when it’s over. Seem a bit basic?
Listen to a few new shows, and you’ll see that it’s far from obvious. In
fact, several show hosts themselves don’t seem to know when a show is
starting and stopping. Imagine what that must be like for the listener!
The following sections give you some tips for creating smooth transitions
into and out of your show.
Why intros and outros are important
The key to effective intro/outro segments is consistency. Listening to
podcasts is, by definition, an episodic experience. By providing a consis-
tent beginning and ending atmosphere at the appropriate times, you put
your listeners in the mood to listen to your show. Similarly, the same
music, words, or other audio they heard the last time your show was
ending can give them a sense of completion and set up anticipation for
future episodes.

Creating a Standard Voiceover for Your Show
37
If conventional broadcasters of TV and radio have
done something right, it’s the way they’ve trained lis-
teners to know when a show is starting and stopping.
This isn’t by accident — it’s a gimmick. Think about
the last time your favorite TV or radio program
started. Your attention quickly focused, shutting out
distractions; your heart rate probably quickened (or
slowed down, if that’s the goal of the show); and you
might have found yourself tapping your foot in time
or singing along with the opening theme music.
That’s just a smart producer capitalizing on the herd
mentality of the human condition, plain and simple.
A similar experience can be noted with followers of
high-energy programs as the show comes to a close.
Rabid fans tend to lose track of time when watching
a show they love, eagerly waiting for more, even
though they know it can’t last forever. And when the
episode fades to black and hits the closing credit
music right at the climax . . . whew!
Finding the right music or sounds
That’s the best place to start: the sounds you use in
your podcast to both lead listeners into and carry
them out of your show, each and every episode. For
some producers, it’s an appropriate piece of bed
music (background music) that effectively carries a
level of energy matching the show’s content. Others
use a mix of clips and effects, building a soundscape
that (again) sets the stage.
Be sure you have the rights to whatever you
use. Your favorite TV show may use a killer
track from last year’s hip-hop star, and your
radio program of choice may use a series of
clips from popular movies. You can do this as
well — as long as you are willing to clear the
rights to use these copyrighted sounds. That’s
not as easy as it sounds, so we highly recom-
mend steering clear and sticking with things
you find that are royalty free or otherwise
cleared for your use. Better yet — try podsafe
music. These are tracks that artists specifically
make available to podcasters to use in their
shows. You can start your search at the Podsafe
Music Network (http://music.podshow
.com), though many other avenues exist.
When you’ve found the perfect intro, start thinking
about and working on your outro. While there’s
nothing stopping you from using a different piece of
music, we highly recommend using the same one
you use as your intro. It provides closure and rein-
forces the signature sound of your show one more
time. Go ahead and use a different time slice if you
can find one that works for your purposes. 
Creating a Standard Voiceover
for Your Show
Once you’ve got the tunes selected, it’s time to con-
sider the verbal branding you’ll wrap around your
show. While plenty of people perform their own
voiceovers fresh and live each time they record, you
may want to consider putting a standard voiceover
in the can and making it a production element you
use every time you start and end your show. What
should you put in there? Well, it all depends on how
much material you don’t want to do live each time.
Giving out general show info
Canned or live each time, it’s a good idea to get a bit
of the administratia right in front of your listeners as
soon as possible. Some good basics include 

The title of your show

The name(s) of your host(s)

A Web site where listeners can find additional
information
If you have a voicemail line, give that number out up
front. This lets your listeners know that you accept
call-in comments, so they should get ready.

Practice 5: Stick to the Script!
38
The end of the show is a great place to 

Cover key contributors.

Provide additional contact information.

Solicit feedback or other forms of support. 

Provide other content that doesn’t fit in with the
main purpose of your show.
Some podcasters use this area to feature select
e-mails or voicemails from the listening audience.
(We cover more of that in Practice 34.) Others find
this a great place to plug other podcasts or give
sponsors some extra love (so to speak).
As you decide what attribution elements belong at
the back of your show, keep in mind that many of
your listeners will opt out of listening once your
main content segment is over. We say this not to
encourage you to sneak in attributions or commer-
cial drops earlier, but to emphasize that you need to
get the important stuff out first. If you have a very
special announcement you want everyone to listen
to at the back end of your show, be sure to pre-sell
that to your audience up front. You can’t assume
they’ll all hang around until the end. In fact, you
should assume that they won’t.
Providing contact and more information
No podcast is an island. Successful podcasters look-
ing to grow an audience will make sure they give
their listening audience every opportunity to find
out more information about the show or to reach
out to the host or producer. Remember that listen-
ers of your show are probably listening to lots of
other shows. You’ll need to make sure they know
where they can get more from you.
We suggest getting your “contact and more” speech
down pat. Once you get it worked out, it should roll
out of your mouth in almost the same way each and
every time. This may sound repetitive — and it is!
It becomes a mantra for you to say — and for your
listeners to say along with you as you say it at its
proper time during each episode of your show. 
Resist the temptation to talk about all the
ways people can find your show, give out
everyone’s e-mail address, and recap the his-
tory of your show since the first episode. The
idea here is to give them some branding
information and a bit of contact information.
That’s about it.
It’s inside this business section where you’ll hear
many podcasters place a paid sponsorship
announcement. We’re torn on this issue, to tell you
the truth. While there is no question that a sponsor
would like to have the paid spot run as early as pos-
sible to ensure that the largest number of ears hear
the announcement, you have to decide whether
that’s right for you and your show. 
If your intent is to put in a brief “today’s episode
is sponsored by Expert Podcasting Practices For
Dummies, helping podcasters elevate their shows to
the next level. Buy it online or at any bookstore near
you,” then fine. It’s short enough that there 
shouldn’t be any problem. But if your intent is to
run a 30-second pre-recorded commercial right 
away — don’t. That isn’t what your audience came
to your show to hear, and you’ll certainly lose more
than one listener if you do it. Your advertisers
should understand; after all, they spend money on
your podcast to reach your listeners, not to alienate
them (and in the process shrink the number of ears
that hear their spot).
Handling attributions
But what if your business section isn’t brief? People
may be willing to sit through a minute of you thank-
ing your sponsor and giving out some contact infor-
mation before you get to your content, but don’t
push it. If you have more to say on the subject — or
would like to give thanks to the myriad people who
helped you with your show — do that at the end of
your show. Get the content out first; worry about
the attribution later.

39
What should you say? There are many points of
view on this, but our recommendation is to make
sure listeners never forget the URL of your Web site.
This is a piece of cake for many shows because
URLs and show names often go hand in hand. But if
not, tell your audience what your Web site address
is. Then spell it to them. Then say it again. No, we’re
not kidding. If you can find a way to make it sing-
songy, even better. You’re trying to create an “ear
bug” that sticks with them.
Why the Web site? Because (assuming it’s set up
properly) that is where listeners can go to find all
sorts of contact information for your show. And
trust us — it’s a lot easier to put a variety of contact
methods on a Web page than to try to cram it into
an audio program. Plus, getting listeners to your
Web site is a great way to reinforce your brand and
show that you are more than just a faceless voice on
a podcast. Figure 5-1 shows one possible example.
• Figure 5-1: Video blogger Chris Brogan puts contact
information in a very obvious position on his
Web page.
Okay, before the objection is raised, yes, we realize
that many folks are listening to your show on
portable mp3 players and probably don’t have a
Web browser handy. Hence the recommendation to
burn your URL into their brains. Your URL, assuming
it is a true domain and not some odd subdomain
with that squiggly line (that’s called a tilde) in it,
should be fairly easy to remember. Even more so if
you repeat it. Again. 
And don’t be afraid to include your contract mantra
at the front and back of your program. Nor should
you be afraid to list a whole bunch of other contact
methods — such as giving out your voicemail num-
ber, reminding listeners to go post on your show’s
notes, giving out your Skype address, or asking them
to add you as their Twitter (www.twitter.com)
friend. All these things are fine, but we recommend
doing all that after you’ve reminded visitors to check
out your Web site.
Middle Management: Planning
the Main Part of Your Show
When you’ve got the front and back of your show
figured out, it’s time to fill up that big space in the
middle. With what? Content!
In the first practice of this book, we give you some
pointers on selecting the right topic for your pod-
cast. For the remainder of this practice, we give you
some tips on structuring your primary content so
it’s enjoyable for your audience to hear — and for
you to create.
Sticking to a theme
It may seem an obvious point, but you really should
have complete command of what you plan on saying
during your episode before you sit down to record
it. Although a stream of consciousness program may
sound appealing, it’s usually more cathartic for the
host than effective for the audience. 
It’s possible — likely, even — that you’ll have quite a
few things you’d like to say or talk about when you
sit in front of the microphone on any given record-
ing day. But while you are assembling your script or
your notes (more about that in a moment), ask your-
self a single question: What is the one thing I’m trying
to communicate today?

Writing a script or preparing show notes
Regardless of whether you choose to be subtle or
blatant about the theme, you’ll find it helpful to give
yourself a roadmap to follow as you work through
the show. Without a script — or at least some pre-
planned show notes — your show may wander
around aimlessly for a while, causing you to do a lot
of work in post-production or (worse) put out an
inferior episode or even (worse still) decide to scrap
the episode altogether. 
Another decision you’ll face is how much to commit
to paper before your show. (Just so you know, many
successful podcasts are nearly 100% scripted.) The
benefits of writing a script include having no sur-
prises, accurately estimating the clock-time of an
episode, and reducing the amount of post-production
editing. The downsides include a requirement for a
significant amount of pre-show planning, a reduction
in the spontaneity of the program, and the dreaded
monotone reading that plagued many a student in
ninth-grade literature class. 
Alternatively, many podcasts take the show notes or
outline approach to planning. The complexity of
show notes can range from hastily scribbled high-
lights on a single sticky note to a well-defined out-
line of topics, complete with an estimate of how
much time to spend on each section. We’re fans of
this more elaborate approach; it allows much more
flexibility than the fully scripted model. Note, how-
ever, that you only get as much out of this approach
as you put in. If your shows tend to ramble, outline
more. If even that doesn’t put the stream of con-
sciousness in check, try a fully scripted episode and
see how you sound. 
Be sure to include consideration of additional ele-
ments (such as music, clips, and even promos for
other podcasts) in the scripting process: How long
do they take? How well do they fit with the theme?
How many do you include? 
Your show itself should already have a well-defined
topic. That same amount of focus should flow
through to your episode creation. Let’s take a show
about sports marketing as an example. In a perfect
world, a single episode would cover a single topic —
sports-arena advertising, for example. If your perfect
world includes giving your listeners more than a sin-
gle topic inside each episode, then select (if possi-
ble) similar topics that are logical companions to
one another.
This theme-building idea serves several purposes:

It assures your audience of an easy-to-follow lis-
tening experience; it won’t have them bouncing
around or trying to figure how all these things
tie together. 

It allows you to talk to points that crop up in this
episode instead of mentioning that you’ll cover
similar topics on future shows. 

It allows listeners to opt out of shows altogether.
That’s not a bad thing — the more you respect
your listeners’ time during a single episode, the
likelier it is they’ll be willing to stay subscribed
to your program.
How do you ensure that your audience gets the theme
you are presenting? Different podcasts approach
themes from various angles, and the true deciding fac-
tor comes down to personal choice. There’s nothing
wrong with stating your intentions for the episode
right away: “On today’s show, we’ll cover a few
approaches to sports-arena advertising.” That way
your audience knows exactly what to expect.
However, your show may not be nearly that cut-and-
dried. If you have a monologue or storytelling pod-
cast, stating your intentions up front may be
tantamount to giving away the punch line prior to
the setup. In these cases, it may be even more
important to work toward a particular theme,
because your audience will be looking for you to
wrap it all up in the end.

Middle Management: Planning the Main Part of Your Show
41
Of course, all this assumes that you currently
are (or would like to start) including these ele-
ments in your show. If you have a six-minute
show covering career opportunities in the 
IT-consulting world, you probably don’t (and
probably shouldn’t) include too big a dose of
these elements.
All too often, these extras are dropped into the
show without giving them too much thought. But
remember that you’re working on building a theme;
all the elements of your show should work toward
that theme. If the tie-in to the piece isn’t immedi-
ately apparent, introduce the element and tell the
audience how it relates. Keeping the idea of rele-
vance first and foremost in your mind ensures that
you’re adding supporting materials to your show, and
not fluff.
One final note on themes — be sure to establish,
and stick with, some sort of theme. When in doubt,
go for an obvious linear theme. Set up the expecta-
tions by telling your audience what you’re about to
do, and then do that in the exact same order. If you
are a bit more avant garde, take the Quentin
Tarantino route: Weave a complex and nonlinear
route to the conclusion. (Just don’t get too convo-
luted; how many people do you know who just 
didn’t “get” Pulp Fiction?)
Setting time limits for segments
Consistency is important in converting casual listen-
ers to loyal fans. One way to give them this consis-
tent experience is to set time limits on your content
segments. Only have a single content segment?
Great. Make it as close to the same length as you
can for each and every episode. Have five or six?
That’s okay, as well. And while you don’t have to
make sure that each episode follows the same clock
time each week (not that that’s a bad idea), the total
elapsed time of all of those elements should cover a
similar chunk of time for each episode.
Making the case for consistency
We can hear many of you screaming out there right now
about time limits. While it is true that many of your more
outspoken loyal listeners are begging you for more content
each week — or they tell you it’s okay to put out a five-
minute episode instead of your normal hour when you’re
out of topics — you and they are missing the point. Your
rabid fan base isn’t threatening to abandon you if you
don’t give them more. (At least we hope they aren’t.
They’re loyal, right?)
But it is highly possible that a listener who was considering
adding your show to his or her podcatcher will take a pass
if you put out a show with widely fluctuating lengths. It’s
about building an expectation and converting those who
just discovered you into subscribers. Your loyal and vocal
audience will understand, trust us.
If your podcast is of the long-form variety (over 30
minutes), you may want to try breaking up your con-
tent into sections. Breaks between the sections give
both you and your audience a chance to regroup,
and they have the added benefit of helping with
clock management. 
Segments don’t have to be self-contained, each with
their own intro and outro. They could be subtle
transitions on your part, as you ease from covering
the latest news in your sector to an essay about a
growing trend. Then again, there’s nothing wrong
with hard and obvious transitions either. We cover
ways to make transitions in Practice 6.
Working with co-hosts provides additional chal-
lenges. Unless you plan your show out meticulously
in advance, you may not know how much content
your co-hosts have to contribute to a given topic.
That’s a sure-fire way to wipe out your time
management.
One way to avoid this problem is to designate one
person as the clock master. This person contributes
to the conversation, but also gets to rule with an
iron thumb. All other hosts should key off of this
person, paying attention when he starts gesticulat-
ing wildly as the end of the segment approaches.

Follow Evo’s 3:15 Rule: Fifteen minutes is a
good length for an interview. That’s a whole lot
longer than your McNews station will ever give
you, yet considerably shorter than what you get
with public broadcasting. (In our opinion, it’s the
perfect time. Your mileage may vary.) 
That’s the 15; here’s the 3: Over that last five
years, Evo has learned that three well-thought-out
and open-ended questions (everything we said
prior to this) will usually fill up those 15 minutes
nicely. As your guest answers, go ahead and ask a
few follow-on questions as they come, giving you
and the guest plenty of time to fully discuss each
question you have. Then move on to the next.
Rinse. Repeat. And take a look at the time. Hey!
15 minutes. . . .
Something to consider
There are two styles of interviewing out there: serious editing
and record-and-release. Both have their fans and detractors;
they’re used about equally. All you need to decide is which
approach you plan to take — before you get the guest on
the phone.
The serious editing crowd (Rob Walch from Podcast411 fits
this profile) enjoys letting a conversation develop naturally.
The recording may go on for an hour or so, with the host,
producer, or engineer spending a lot of time getting to the
good stuff and cutting out the rest. Easy to overdo? Sure.
But these interviews tend to sound very polished and pro-
fessional. Who couldn’t do with the removal of a few ums
and stutters?
Those of the record-and-release persuasion (Evo likes this
style) tend to have a bit more practice at interviewing and a
lot less time to spend in post. These conversations get min-
imal editing, usually only to correct miscues and sound lev-
els (more on that in Practice 18). Pitfalls include sounding
rushed and missing out on longer conversations. 
Writing for Your Podcast
Writing for a podcast (or any type of spoken-word
distribution) is a lot different from writing for print.
Take it from some guys who have done both — with
varying degrees of success.
And of course, don’t forget about the magic of post-
production. If a conversation is going really well, but
getting really long, and you don’t want to pull out
the aforementioned iron thumb, just let it continue.
You can always cut out the boring parts or just limit
the time in the next segment. Again, the idea isn’t to
be a total slave to the clock and hit your internal
numbers as a radio show host might be required to
do. Just be respectful of your listeners’ time, and
you should be fine.
Incorporating interviews
Interviews are often added as content elements, and
in some cases they’re the main content elements.
There are dozens of fine books on the art of inter-
viewing, so this book won’t dig too deeply into that
topic. But a few pointers can’t hurt:

Set your guest’s expectations before you hit
Record. Take a few moments to tell the guest
about your interview style, how long you expect
the interview to take, and (of course) what you
plan on asking about. No one wants to be
uncomfortable.

Keep the questions relevant. It’s okay to break
the ice with some small talk. But if you find your-
self interviewing an internationally renowned
author, refrain from asking (for example)
whether she caught last night’s episode of your
favorite reality program (probably not — and
your audience doesn’t care).

Keep the questions short. The idea is to get long
responses from your guest — not to take three
minutes to ask a question. Avoid things like
“That reminds me of a question I was about to
ask you about . . .” and just get on with your
question, please.

Ask open-ended questions. It’s frustrating for
your listeners — and for your guests — if all
they can do is answer with yes or no. The same
holds true for long praise statements where the
guests can only say thank you. Ask about why
they did something, what was happening when
they were doing it, and where they are going
next. You’ll get quality answers there.

Writing for Your Podcast
43
The biggest thing to keep in mind is that podcast lis-
teners tend to do other things while they’re listening
to a podcast. That’s significantly different from
someone who is reading a book or an article. It’s no
problem to listen to a podcast when driving down
the road, washing the dishes, or cleaning your
office. Try doing those activities when reading.
(Come to think of it, don’t even try reading and driv-
ing at the same time. Not safe.) See the difference?
The best way to avoid running afoul of this difference
is by following the K.I.S.S. principle: Keep It Simple,
Silly. Stay away from long and complicated sentences
in favor of shorter, more concise statements. While
the ability to string together clauses and phrases
might indicate your strong command of your native
tongue, it’ll probably leave your audience wondering
what the heck you just said and reaching for the
Rewind button — or (worse) the Unsubscribe feature.
And don’t be afraid to repeat yourself to drive the
main points home. If something bears repeating —
repeat it! While almost all mp3 players have a
Rewind feature, that’s not how the public has been
trained to consume audio. Don’t make your listeners
wonder Did I get that right? Give it to ’em again!
If you find yourself writing out more than show
notes for your podcast, then you may have caught
the writing bug. In that case, we highly recommend
finding a writing for broadcasting class at a local
community college. Say what you will about tradi-
tional media, the radio industry has learned a lot
over the years about how to grab and keep people’s
attention. If your local community college doesn’t
offer a course, head to the bookstore or library and
grab a short stack of books to glean for pointers.
Your content will be the better for it.

Transitions, Timing,
and Cues
H
ow easy do you make it on your audience to listen to your show?
Leaving aside the topics of finding your show and filling it with
great content, what about the physical activity of listening (or
watching, if it’s a video podcast) that your audience goes through each
time they consume your program? What may seem like a very passive
activity is actually anything but, and producers who understand the
listening process — and what listeners have been trained to expect —
will create a better show.
Consider (by analogy) reading: Text is easier to read when the writer uses
correct punctuation, groups related content into paragraphs, gathers para-
graphs into sections, and then combines paragraphs into chapters as the
final book is assembled. A good author (or editor) uses various techniques
to segue from one segment to another at each of those transition points.
In this practice, we show you how to apply that same philosophy to your
podcast — including ways to make good transitions during a live record-
ing session and how to add them in during the post-editing process.
Consider it “packaging” — and understand that it can make your show
dramatically more listenable.
Making Transitions with Bumpers
and Rejoiners
Unless your podcast episode is about a single self-contained topic, you
will likely cover multiple topics or have more than one segment during
your show. These different sections can be thought of as scenes inside of
a television show or movie. You need to get your audience through all of
these segments in a smooth and orderly fashion. 
The primary method of making a transition inside a podcast is with a
bumper or a rejoiner. Consider these the conjunctions of podcasting. Other
names are often used, such as sweepers, tags, and so on. But all of them
are used as obvious clues that signify something has changed or is about
to change in the podcast. And bumpers and rejoiners aren’t exclusive to

Pauses Are a Good Thing
45
podcasting. Heck, no — we stole the idea from mass
media such as radio and television. 
Rejoiners
Rejoiners are probably the easiest elements to add
to your show. The name rejoiner implies that the lis-
tening audience went somewhere else (perhaps lis-
tening to a commercial or a special content
segment) and are now coming back to rejoin the
host or main content of the program.
Producing these elements can be as simple as select-
ing an appropriate piece of bed music or a snippet
from a song. Of course, you can also use sound effects
as well, either in conjunction with the song or by
themselves. Many podcasters will also add voiceover
elements, sometimes even falling back on an old radio
standby: “And now . . . back to the show!”
Bumpers
In contrast, a bumper usually leads in a new segment
and pays less homage to the content that came
before. For example, a self-contained segment within
a show may have its own specialized introductory
bumper that gets played before the content is
added. Let’s say our fictitious sports-marketing pod-
cast has a regular segment that recaps the major
sponsorship deals announced since the last record-
ing. A pre-produced clip, complete with the sounds
of cheering crowds and cash registers ringing, is
played right before the start of this segment.
Stay legal, okay? Make sure any clips, sound
effects, and music you use for your bumpers
and rejoiners are in the public domain or have
had their rights cleared for you to use. Contrary
to popular belief, there is no five-second rule —
or any time-frame rule — of how much copy-
righted material you can use legally. For a great
list of the ways U.S. copyright laws apply to
podcasting (and some lists of places to find ele-
ments you can use legally), we highly recom-
mend spending some quality time with the
Podcaster’s Legal Guide (http://wiki.
creativecommons.org/Podcasting_
Legal_Guide).
Using them in your show
Coming up with ideas for bumpers and rejoiners can
be a lot of fun and a great way to express your cre-
ative side. But don’t get carried away with the pro-
duction; keep ’em short — very short. Your listeners
don’t want to hear the complete bio of a frequent
guest every time the bumper plays, and they’ll be
less impressed with your mad editing skills if the
rejoiner plays longer than the content segment that
follows it. 
As a rule, bumpers and rejoiners should play for no
more than five seconds, though it’s acceptable to
have them play longer — provided the real content
starts inside that five-second time frame.
Pauses Are a Good Thing
Radio has trained us, both as listeners and as produc-
ers, to be wary of dead air — the condition where no
discernable sound is being recorded or transmitted.
Back in the days when radio and television stations
were discovered by turning a dial, eliminating dead
air made obvious sense. Silence (or static) meant
nothing existed at this point on the dial, so potential
listeners would keep turning in their quest to find
a station that was transmitting. This is less of a
problem today with better feedback mechanisms
on radios and televisions that let you know you’ve
actually found a transmitting station. Yet, if you sat
for a moment in front of a television or listened to
a radio station that was broadcasting dead air, even
today, you’d wonder.
Podcasting isn’t plagued by that problem, and
silence (not static) can be used as an effective tool
in the presentation. If the host of a podcast takes a
few moments to digest the last answer the guest
gave before moving on to the next question, it’s a
stretch to think someone will chose that point to
abandon the show. And because podcasts all start
at (well, yeah) the beginning, there is little chance
that someone will discover your show during a
moment of silence.

Using Signals and Signs to
Keep the Conversation Flowing
Smoothly
In two-party conversations, if one party pauses, it’s
often an invitation to the other party to start talking.
While this is a natural condition and may lead to a
fine-sounding recording session, it can also cause
things to sound a bit disjointed — especially if the
first party wasn’t finished and comes back to the
point later. 
To combat this potential confusion, everyone
should fully develop excellent listening skills and
learn to play nicely with others. Okay, once you’ve
stopped laughing at that suggestion and can resume
reading, we invite you to consider an alternative:
developing a set of signs or signals to use with your
co-hosts to keep from stepping on each other’s toes
conversationally.
This system need not be as complicated as the U.S.
Navy’s semaphore flag system. Many podcasting
teams get along fine simply by stepping up to or
moving away from their respective microphones to
indicate their desire to chime in. If you need more
than that, it can be as simple as agreeing on the fol-
lowing signals:

I’m next

Your turn

I’m not finished

Wrap it up
Do you need more than that? Go ahead and develop
those signals — but you probably won’t need to go
much farther than that. And before you start devel-
oping overly complex systems, remember that you
can always either stop recording and discuss it, or
discuss what needs to be covered and then edit out
the discussion in post-production editing.
Broadcast media aside, pauses are a natural part of
the communication process. They can be used to
drive a point home or to signify a change in mood or
topic, or simply used as an effect. Take the pauses
out and you can significantly change the message.
Here are some tips on keeping the pauses in your
podcast:

Think about the value of pauses both while you
are recording and editing your content.

During the recording process, talk slowly. Slower,
in fact, than what you think sounds good. When
it sounds like you are going too slow, you’re
probably getting just the right pacing. 

If you’re speaking off the cuff, don’t be afraid to
take a breath between sentences or to gather
your thoughts when moving to a new topic.

It’s simple enough to remove pauses in post-
production, but much more difficult to add them
if they are missing.

When you are editing your file, be wary of chop-
ping out all those blank spots in the wav form,
even if you need to cut for time. Some engineers
out there may argue with us and swear they
can cut down the length of a pause without
listening — but allow us some polite skepticism:
They’re wrong. 
There is no perfect length for a pause; the appropri-
ate length of a pause is determined by a complex
mixture of pacing, diction, content, and a host of
other factors. Our point? Don’t edit out a pause
without listening to it in its full context. 
By full context, we mean listening to more than a few
seconds of the podcast before and after the pause.
Okay, if you’re familiar with the content (for exam-
ple, if you just laid down the track moments ago),
you can probably get away with doing that. If that’s
not the case, your best bet is to back up 10 to 15
seconds (and an entire minute may be a better idea)
and listen from that point. That way you’re more
likely to get the point and purpose for the pause.

Fade In, Fade Out
47
If you and your co-host(s) are recording in the
same location, we submit the following Universally
Accepted Podcaster Signaling Conventions (yes, we
just made up that title):

“I’m next.” Index finger raised vertically, just off
to the side of your microphone in easy view of
your co-hosts. Should you feel the need, wave
the finger in a slight side-to-side motion to
capture the attention of your companions.
Increase the frequency and magnitude of said
waving as necessary.

“Your turn.” Index finger leveled on the horizon-
tal plane, with a line-of-sight directed toward
another host, usually one who has given the
“I’m next” signal already. If no one has indicated
a desire to go next, use both index fingers to ref-
erence yourself and then flick the fingers out and
away from your body to indicate another host
should be preparing to go next. 

“I’m not finished.” Raise the hand, fingers
together, palm facing out to the other hosts of the
program. This is most commonly used when
another host has prematurely given the “I’m next”
signal or the current speaker is about to make a
dramatic pause, yet has additional information to
present.

“Wrap it up.” Both index fingers extended along
the horizontal plane, pointing slightly above
and below the other. Rotate each finger (or each
wrist, depending on your level of manual dexter-
ity) in a barrel-roll fashion, each around the
other, as if you were wrapping string around
both. This signal is most often used by the host
(who’s watching the clock near the end of the
prescribed time), or to indicate to another host
that once again he or she has been rambling
non-stop and enough is enough.
Signals such as these are quickly adopted by the
staff and can prove very helpful in making the show
sound “together.” But what if one host is in Madison,
Wisconsin, and the other is in Madrid, Spain? While
videoconferencing software can solve this problem
rather nicely, the bandwidth restrictions of such a
connection have a negative impact on the audio
recording (assuming you’re using the same pipe to
pass the video as well as the audio stream).
For remote applications, we suggest keeping an
instant messaging application, such as Skype
(http://skype.com), open between all parties dur-
ing the conversation. The same signals can be used,
either by typing them completely or by an agreed-
upon shorthand convention, such as Me/You/Not
Done/Wrap.
You can use instant messaging (IM) applica-
tions to make it seem like you are in the same
room with your co-host. But the illusion is bro-
ken if you allow the audio notifications from
that IM application to make it into your record-
ing. First, make sure that the audio notifications
for your IM application are disabled so these
sounds don’t make it into your recording ses-
sion. In most programs, you can access this fea-
ture in the Preferences or Settings menu; look
under Audio, Alerts, or Notifications.
Second, do your best to make sure you won’t
be disturbed by others who may also know
your IM handle or screen name. In Skype, you
can change your setting to Do Not Disturb —
which also turns off any audio notifications.
More popular-with-the-masses podcasters
may decide to utilize a private screen name
known only to their co-hosts, or to use a dif-
ferent application altogether that is not fre-
quented by their adoring fans.
Fade In, Fade Out
We saved the best — and perhaps most important —
transition for last. And oddly enough, it’s the one we
have the least to say about. The other transitions
we’ve discussed in this practice will help the various
segments of your podcast flow together. But how will
your podcast itself flow with your listeners as they
make the transition from one podcast to another?
We know it’s difficult to imagine, but people listen to
more shows than just yours. In fact, they may listen
to some of those shows more often than they listen
to yours. 

Practice 6: Transitions, Timing, and Cues


Don’t keep us in suspense! Tell us what we can
expect out of this program today.

Keep the chatter to a minimum. Too many hosts
engage in a silly amount of meaningless banter
at the start of the show in some strange attempt
to fool the audience into thinking it’s the first
time the shows have come together. Please. Get
that stuff out of the way before the show starts
(or take it out in post-production).
Likewise for outros:

Thank the listeners for their time and invite
them back for more. Common courtesy.

Tell your listeners when they can expect a new
show. Remember: It’s the first-time listener you
are trying to win over.

Roll your ending bed music 30 seconds before
you finish talking. This gives an easy audio cue
that things are wrapping up.

When you’re finished talking, let your outro
music continue for around 15 seconds. Fade the
last five.
As with all rules in podcasting, these are made to be
broken. In fact, call ’em guidelines — they’re designed
to be modified to fit your needs. The goal of this
practice is not to give you hard-and-fast rules, but to
foster a sense of continuity and consistency for your
podcast — which helps you create a better show for
you and your listeners to enjoy.
As an expert podcaster, you owe it to your audience
to not only let them know when you’ve started and
are stopping, but also make those things happen
gradually. While it’s important to get to the point
quickly, make sure you give the audience an ade-
quate setup before you launch into your topic. If
your audience has to play catch-up as they work on
digesting the end of the last show they were listen-
ing to, they might miss some of what you’ve worked
so hard to present. And by the same token, wrap-
ping up your show with a simple “the end” and hitting
the Stop button may sound a little harsh.
Practice 5 gives you many ideas on coming up with
effective intros and outros for your show. But as you
are deciding how to best implement them, try and
look at the situation as if your entire show were a
single segment in someone’s overall listening day.
Here’s a great place to take more cues from broad-
cast media, who spend lots of time making sure
that transitions from one show to another are as
seamless as possible. While you won’t have a lot
(read: any) control of how the next show comes up
in the listening queue — or of how the previous
show was ended by its host — you can do your part
by being a good contributor to the podosphere.
Here are some pointers for intros:

State the name of your show and the day you
recorded it before anything else happens. If your
show isn’t date sensitive, an episode number will
suffice. Then play your opening music.

Keep your canned intro to less than a minute.

Reviewing Your
Podcast with a
Critical Eye
Y
ou are a podcaster. You care about your work. You’ve poured your
heart and soul into the script, carefully enunciated every word dur-
ing the recording, agonized over the decision on various effects
and aural enhancements, and spent meticulous hours in post-production.
It is a thing of beauty, worthy of both recognition and praise from your
peers — nay, the entire world.
Hold on a minute, hotfoot. You may have missed a critical step in this
process: listening to what you have done.
“But wait,” you exclaim in frustration. “I just spent the last three hours of
my life editing this file. Trust me, I’ve listened!” And we’d agree with that
statement. But we’d also argue (and we’d win, ’cuz we’re the authors and
we RULE) that the ears you listen with differ at each one of the various
stages of production.
In this practice, we discuss a new set of ears (and eyes) that have to be
utilized after all the other ears (and eyes) have been satisfied. These are
the ears and eyes of the Self-Critic, a persona you will need to adopt and
modify over time as the goals and objectives for your podcast change.
The Self-Critic has to be detached, clinical, and even cold. He’s not a very
nice person and is all business. Those other eyes and ears utilized in
other stages all work for this guy, and he’s quite the taskmaster. 
Keep this guy locked up in a tiny box until you’re completely done
with the show, from pre-production all the way through post. In fact,
get some sleep, dinner, or at least a cup of tea before you let this guy
out of the box to wreak havoc on your final product. You’re more
likely to get an honest opinion out of him if you give yourself some
time to gain a little perspective. (Oh yeah — getting some sleep
beforehand is good.)
Accessing Audio Quality
Every single episode of your podcast should be reviewed for audio qual-
ity from start to finish after you’ve finished all post-production.

Weird noises (unintended)
When you find these problems, we recommend that
you don’t do anything immediately. Instead take
note of them by following these steps:
1.
Pause the playback, and then jot down the time
stamp and a quick description of the problem.
2.
Back up a few seconds before the error and
resume your critical review of the audio quality. 
3.
Repeat these steps as necessary until the very
end of the audio file — no cheating!
Deciding whether to fix them
When you’ve found all the problems with the file, it’s
time to determine what to do about them. You’ll want
to go back and fix most flaws. They are errors, after
all. But some podcasters deliberately leave some
flaws — from stumbles to paper shuffles — intact to
emphasize the reality quotient of their program.
There exists a difference between “letting
the reality of the recording process come
through” and “just being lazy.” Your audience
expects a certain amount of professionalism
from you, but we’ll not presuppose to tell you
where that level lies. Having said that, we
can’t think of a good reason to let the bed
music overpower your content, or to let an
added effect blow out your audience’s
eardrums. 
If you decide to leave in an error you noticed in your
show, cross it off your list. At the same time, decide
whether there’s anything you can do to future
recordings to stop that from happening in the first
place. (If you’d like some pointers, we get into quite
a few ways to improve the recording and editing
process later in this book.)
Yes, from the beginning.
Yes, through the ending.
Yes, every time.
We understand that you’re in a hurry. But we really
don’t care. The only way to make sure that all those
transitions, edits, fixes, and segues sound as good
as you thought they did is to listen to all of them
together as a whole — and in one sitting. So don’t try
to pull this off in chunks. If your show is 30 minutes
long, find a block of time during the day when you
won’t be interrupted for 30 minutes, and just listen.
You are about to release your show to dozens/
hundreds/thousands of listeners, many of whom
will be listening intently to what you have to say.
You do them a disservice if you don’t listen with the
same intensity prior to letting them hear it.
Invest in a pair of good-quality studio head-
phones. (See Practice 9 to find out what to look
for.) While many of your listeners will probably
listen with ear buds, through built-in computer
speakers, or through their car stereo systems,
others will not. If you do your critical review
(and probably even your editing) with a pair of
great headphones, you’ll hear your show in the
best environment possible and have the chance
to catch details (and tiny flaws) that might go
unnoticed by your audience — but why take
the chance?
Finding problems
For now, you’ll just be focusing on the quality of
the audio. Depending on the content of your show,
there could be any number of issues to watch out
for. Here are a few of the more-common audio prob-
lems to listen for:

Mic pops

Background noise

Finding the Perfect Length for Your Show
51
For those remaining issues you have decided to fix,
head back into your files and start tweaking. (Check
out Practice 21 for tips on effective editing.) It’s
highly recommended to have a dedicated issue edit
session where you take care of all the issues on your
list. When you’re finished with all your edits, finalize
your episode and listen to it — from start to finish —
again. No, we’re not kidding.
Finding the Perfect Length
for Your Show
Forget about the philosophical debates on the
nature of existence, the meaning of life, and how
many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie
Roll Tootsie Pop. Podcasters know of the eternal
question that rises above all others: What is the per-
fect length for a podcast?
As we remove our firmly planted tongues from our
cheeks, we recognize that there have been many
opinions put forth on this topic. But that’s not going
to stop us from staking our own flag in the ground
over this perennial issue. Heck, we wrote the book,
so our answer is correct by default! (If only this were
true for other things in life. . . .)
Actually, there are three different answers, and all
require a bit of explanation.
Easy answer: 20–40 minutes
If you genuinely have no opinion on the matter and
are willing and able to create a show independent of
time constraints, then shoot for 20 minutes, giving
yourself some time to run long. Within the podos-
phere, there exists a highly questionable (yet
ingrained) collective wisdom that defines the aver-
age commuting time as between 20 and 40 minutes.
And while none of your authors strive to be average
with anything that they do, they are willing to pay
homage to that particular figure — the idea is for
your podcast to get the listener from door to door.
This range also fits in with our history as media
consumers. Most television shows — at least those
broadcast in the U.S. — clock in at the 30-minute or
one-hour mark. Take out the commercials, and you
are down to about 20 minutes or 40 minutes (respec-
tively) of show time. It fits nicely with the time frame
in which we’ve all been trained to give our attention
to our media programs.
Hard answer: As short as it possibly can be
Notice how we change the operative word from long
to short. When people talk of length, they’re thinking
in terms of making something long. It’s a form of the
word, so it makes sense. But that sort of thinking
can (and often does) slip into padding the podcast
with filler; podcasters get hung up on a predeter-
mined length for their ’casts, and wonder what to do
to stretch the content to fill up the time.
But if you turn that concept on its head and start
thinking about how short you can make your show,
you’ll do a service to both your audience and your-
self. What is this service of which we speak? Respect.
Respect for everyone’s time, because we live in a
busy world and have little use for superfluous
content.
Apply this advice judiciously. We never rec-
ommend the sacrifice of quality content for
saving a few minutes of time. Talk as long
about a topic or to a guest as is necessary.
Just don’t feel the need to stretch.
Short shows don’t have to be short, but long shows
always feel long. You’re going for that “lost time”
feeling, where your listeners get so wrapped up in
the content of your program that they literally lose
track of the time. NPR calls this driveway time —
listeners are so interested in what they’re hearing
that they don’t want to get out of their cars to go
inside. (It’s a bonus for us podcasters that our con-
tent is available on a portable player; listeners can
take us inside with them.)

Practice 7: Reviewing Your Podcast with a Critical Eye

they take longer to consume — and prepare. The
shows that fit well into this format run the gamut,
and it’s likely that the majority of podcasts fit this
time frame. And while many listeners enjoy these
longer-format programs, they do lead busy lives.
Keep that in mind before you decide to launch
another hour-long program.
It’s your show, and you get to decide how long the
show should be to be perfect. But think about your
content, the larger podosphere, and your potential
listeners’ time before you rush headlong into a deci-
sion, or automatically assume a particular episode
length. You aren’t stuck with any preset format
clock, and variety is the spice of life.
Strive for consistency in whatever 
standard length you choose
When evaluating your episodes for the perfect
length, keep consistency in mind. We’re all creatures
of habit, and we like our established expectations to
be met each time. As you’re planning out your show,
do your best to fall within a standard length for each
episode. 
This standard length rule was meant to be
broken. From time to time, and if you have a
really-great-but-a-little-long piece of content,
break it. But please let your audience know up
front that the show will be a little different
from what they’ve come to expect from you.
Consistency helps your listeners figure out when they
can listen to your program. Consider the commuter
who knows that she has a 10-minute wait when she
switches trains each morning. She knows she can fit
in an episode of Ask a Ninja (http://askaninja.
com) and Happy Tree Friends (http://happytree
friends.com) because they usually clock in at less
than four minutes each episode. But she probably
knows not to start For Immediate Release (www.
forimmediaterelease.biz) because she’ll be at
the office in 20 minutes, and Shel and Nevil almost
always talk for about an hour.
Bite-size, snack-size, and meal-size content
When trying to find the perfect length for your show,
consider the bite-size, snack-size, and meal-size con-
tent idea, which we first heard about from Chia-Lin
Simmons from the On Digital Media podcast
(http://ondigitalmedia.com). The concept is
pretty simple to grasp, and it may open new
avenues for your show.
Bite-size content is short — very short. It may be as
short as a single song but up to a few minutes in
length. Obviously, there isn’t a lot of time for up-front
setup or a sizeable credit roll at the end of each pod-
cast. Get in quick, deliver some quick content, and
get back out so your listeners can move on to other
things in the playlist or go on about their day.
Notable examples include Five Minute Memoirs,
(www.fiveminutememoir.com), Career Opportunities
(http://welchwrite.com/dewelch/ce/), and the
One Minute How-To podcast (http://OneMinute
HowTo.com).
This format is great for daily programming.
Everyone is busy, and they sure would like to
consume more podcasts. Shows with a high
frequency of updates are often on the chop-
ping block as listeners start looking for more
variety. It’s a lot easier to decide to keep a
show that updates frequently if it only takes a
couple of minutes to listen.
Snack-size content fits in the 10–20 minute range.
Like their bite-size brethren, snack-size shows are
easy on the listener, yet give the content provider a
little more room to work. Music podcasters can fit
two or three songs in while still leaving room to dis-
cuss the story behind the band, song, or whatever. 
This length is also great for single-interview pro-
grams that don’t need to go too in depth on a topic.
You’d be surprised how much great content you can
fit into a 15-minute interview. See Practice 5 for
Evo’s 3:15 rule.
Anything that goes over the 20-minute mark falls
into the meal-size category. As the name implies,

Evaluating Your Supporting Materials
53
Working toward the same length for each episode
will also help your show grow. Many listeners will
try out a few episodes, either by downloading a few
or by listening on the Web site, before subscribing.
Providing episodes of a uniform length conveys
some sense of assurance to the new audience;
variable-length shows may cause potential listeners
to back off from making your show a regular listen-
ing habit, or even assume a lack of attention to
detail on your part.
Critiquing the Content 
of Your Show
If you thought that audio quality and length weren’t
hard enough to view with a critical eye, you also
need to critique your content. As the two prior
sections mentioned, you need a certain amount
of detachment and objectiveness to effectively
evaluate the chosen content of your program. And
yeah, that’s going to be a challenge to cultivate.
We’re going to go out on a limb here and assume
that you really like the content of your podcast
episodes and you feel that they’re worthy of distrib-
uting to the larger world — even it that larger world
is a small group of dedicated listeners. If you are
jaded, the obvious choice is to go outside of your-
self and ask for somebody else’s perspective on
your podcast’s content. Well . . .
We highly recommend that you avoid doing this.
Getting a slew of opinions is a slippery slope that we
really don’t want to see you take. The most impor-
tant person in the world for your podcast content
to please is you. If living on the Internet has taught
your authors any one thing, it’s that no matter how
strange your tastes, there exists at least one other
person with the same proclivities. Podcasting is
about serving the needs of niche audiences, not pan-
dering to the whims and desires of some imagined
mass audience. If you podcast with a group of folks,
then by all means get their opinions and come up
with a collective decision on the content for your
show and whether or not any particular episode is
up to par.
Beware of fans bearing advice. We love fans,
but we also understand that fans are about
as far from objective as anyone. Some fans
will want you to focus on one show. Others
will lobby for a particular show length; still
others will suggest that you avoid particular
topics. This is often great advice, but under-
stand that these individuals want their needs
served over all others. For examples of why
that isn’t a good idea, listen critically to any
run-of-the-mill top-40 music artist. Doesn’t the
music all sound the same? A little too safe? A
little too predictable?
Most podcasters start questioning their content
because of what they perceive as a small audience
size. Granted, sweeping changes to your show
might attract more listeners. Of course, those same
changes might also drive away those who have
been with you for a while. Deciding whether to
make changes is difficult, and there is no absolute
right answer that works for all podcasts. However,
we offer you this perspective: If you had a weekly
talk scheduled in the real world every single week
and 100 people showed up to listen to you every
time, would you be disappointed? (We’d be thrilled.)
Evaluating Your Supporting
Materials
A good critique of your own podcast doesn’t end with
a thorough analysis of the audio file. That might work
for radio-show hosts, because they have little control
over how the entire station is run. Podcasters usually
have more to worry about than that, because listen-
ing to the show is only a part of the experience. We
concede that it is the most important part, but you
have to make sure your supporting materials — the
messy parts — are all in top working order to allow
your show to reach its full potential.

RSS means Really Simple Syndication and inher-
ently assumes that someone, somewhere will
repurpose that feed. Do you make it easy for that
to happen? And are you okay with that? 
Web site
Here are some Web site basics to nail down. If you
aren’t sure they’re secure yet, Practice 27 will be
your friend.

Will visitors to your Web site have any idea that
you are producing a podcast?

Do you make it easy for them to listen and
(hopefully) subscribe?

Does the presentation of your site convey
what your program is about with graphics and
supporting text? 

Have you made it easy to read your show notes
and for people to help promote your site with
various social-media applications?
These points demonstrate the need for a critical eye
on various aspects of your podcast. Some chores
(such as checking the final audio quality) simply
must be done with each and every episode. Others
(such as checking your supporting material) should
be done on a regular basis; still others (in particular,
decisions on content and length) are probably best
done infrequently. Be your own best critic; there are
always plenty of others waiting in the wings to tell
you what they think. Make sure you know what you
think before that happens.
Here are a few questions to ask yourself about three
critical components of your podcast:
mp3 files
We cover the mp3 angle in full detail in Practice 23,
but here are the starting points: 

How do your files display in various mp3 players? 

Is the sample rate constant so that the files play
properly in Flash-based players (and you don’t
sound like Alvin the Chipmunk)? 

Did you take the time to fill out your ID3 tags —
complete with an image — and do you know how
iTunes will be changing tags on your episodes?
Yeah, iTunes does that. 
RSS feed

covered for your RSS feed, but here’s what they look
like:

Does your feed validate? In other words, is it free
of errors, and have you checked? Practice 27
covers this.

Are you providing adequate information about
your episodes and is the iTunes Music Store
updated with your most recent episodes?

Do people have a way to contact you from your
feed?

Is your copyright statement accurate and reflec-
tive of your desires?

t’s so exciting when you come up with that idea for a podcast. You
could be driving home from a workshop on how to podcast, working
out at the gym, or just enjoying some quality time at the playground
with your kid, and suddenly the idea strikes you — and whether it’s in
your iRiver, on a cocktail napkin, or on the back of an envelope, you start
jotting down what you want to rant about. Your message is beginning to
take shape, and you want to share your idea with the world. 
Now you decide to start telling friends, acquaintances, and other pod-
casters that yes, you have a show in the works, and you cannot wait to
get things underway. The questions “How often will it post?” and “How
long will the show be?” start filtering in, and then you sit down to record
the premiere episode . . .
. . . and this is when you discover that the real work has begun.
The Blog: Your Personal Hype Machine 
There is nothing wrong with a little bit of hype. Hype is what gets people
talking, and it can make incredible things happen. The force-of-nature in
podcasting that is Scott Sigler proved that by generating incredible hype
for the release of his book, Ancestor, using his feed (and others’ feeds) to
distribute a digital version of the book. That hype was instrumental in
taking Ancestor to the top of Amazon’s Science Fiction and Horror charts,
and up to the Top Ten–ranked books alongside the Harry Potter series
and a few of Oprah’s picks.
So how can you make hype happen? The first thing you can do is set up a
blog for yourself.

A podcast not necessarily in that order 
Just because you have five episodes done and ready to go
does not mean you have to post those five in order (unless
your show material is time-sensitive or sequential, as in a
novel or play). Flexibility is a good thing; there’s nothing
wrong with holding the last two shows of your first five if
you record an interview that’s too good not to post right
away. These five recorded episodes can always be renamed,
updated, or simply put on hold until you need them. 
And don’t forget those show notes — your guidelines
through the beginning stages of your production. Give
yourself a bit of wiggle room and don’t worry about stick-
ing rigidly to what you’ve produced. In the end, this is your
podcast; those first five shows are merely your measure of
how much time, effort, and material you have for your
show’s topic.

Outline the first five episodes of your show.
Make up full show notes so you can gauge
exactly how much material you intend to 
record.

If you still have a head full of ideas for
episodes, continue to brainstorm. See if you
can outline up to ten episodes.

Depending on the ease of producing your show
notes (and how much material you plan to
record), consider how often you will want to
post a show. If you struggle in planning the first
five, aim for a monthly or bimonthly schedule. If
you have plenty of material extending across ten
(or more) episodes, a weekly schedule could
work for your show.
The more extensive the show notes you pro-
duce, the more accurately you can plan how
long your episodes will be. If you’re planning
to keep your show under 30 minutes per
episode, and your show notes run longer than
two pages, it might be a good idea to find a
breaking point in the show notes and make
one episode into two. By generating show
notes you can gauge exactly how long your
show will be.
your blog so they’re complete and ready for posting
later) — but do not submit your feed to directories
until you and your five episodes are ready to go.
Then — and only then — should you kick off your
podcast.
Does It Have to Be Five
Episodes?
The question put to us quite frequently is why five
episodes? Why not three? Why not just create one
episode, whip up a promo, and then go for it?
Because not all episodes of a podcast are created
equal. 
That may sound like a throwaway answer, but
nothing could be further from the truth. Podcasts
vary in production demands and effort, even if you
have their format set, a boilerplate beginning and
ending, and a good idea how you want them to go.
Interviews, for example, may be a simple matter of
tacking on an intro at the beginning and then an
outro at the end. Roundtable discussions may
not only need editing, but also require some post-
production level-setting. Solo efforts may need
severe cleanup in post; you may even have to 
re-record certain segments. The production
demands vary based on whether you want to stick
with the basics of recording and mixing, or exercise
your creative muscles in the realm of audio. By
editing five episodes before officially launching
your podcast, you not only develop your approach
to podcasting but also get a good idea how long it
will take you to record and edit a single episode.
Before putting together the first of these five episodes,
you can do a few things to get an even better idea
of how much material you will need to have on 
hand:

Does It Have to Be Five Episodes?
59

After you’ve created show notes to cover the
first five episodes, script a one-minute promo
for your podcast. This should be the first thing
you edit and record and release in your podcast
feed.

After recording the first five episodes, have
them tagged, compressed, and ready to go.
You can either post them as needed, or post
all of them and simply provide links to them
when needed. (See Practice 25 for more on 
tags.)
Producing five episodes will give you a good idea of
exactly how much effort you can expect to put into
this podcast on a regular basis. Knowing that is a
key to a podcast’s success. Regardless of whether
the production values are high (adding in special
effects in post-production, incorporating vocal tal-
ent other than your own, and so on) or kept to the
basics (one voice, one mic), knowing how much
work goes into the podcast will only help you to
plan and prepare more efficiently. One way to
do that is to know exactly how much of what goes
into each episode of your podcast. As long as the
amount of effort suits your purpose and doesn’t
strain your resources, you can’t go wrong. You’ll
also find that having five episodes all set and ready
to go is a terrific security blanket when you’re
launching your podcast.

Upgrading Your
Headphones
I
f you ever see Escape Pod’s Steve Eley at a podcast camp or at a sci-
ence fiction convention, you will discover he is a man of conviction.
In other words, he’s got an opinion on everything! 
There is a bit of advice he gives again and again, on panel discussions, on
speaker talks, and on the show Podholes (http://www.podholes.com),
which he co-hosts with Michael R. Mennenga: 
“Get good headphones before a better microphone.”
We have always found this advice and his reasoning behind it to be rock-
solid, but because our own headphones were doing just fine, we never
really considered the investment.
When we finally did, we asked ourselves what took us so long.
Why Focus on Headphones?
When podcasters want to upgrade their studios, usually it’s the
mixer board or the microphone that’s the first accessory targeted for
improvement — but (along with Eley) we recommend that you take a
good, long look at your headphones. They’re an aspect of the studio eas-
ily overlooked but perhaps the most important add-on to your studio.
Think about it — the headphones are telling you how you sound.
As with microphones, there are different kinds of headphones out there,
different styles and different makes. Shopping for decent headphones can
be intimidating. But just like with any audio gear, if you know what to look
for, the intimidation factor is removed completely from the equation.
Shop safe. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.

I used noise reduction . . . but I still hear
something!
You can reduce the amount of surrounding ambient noise
either during the recording process or in post-production by
applying noise-reduction filters. However, keep in mind that
“noise reduction” is not the same as “noise eliminating.”
Post-production filters, external compressors, and noise
gates can only do so much with sound before the audio
begins to distort. The best way to make sure you have little
(if any) ambient background noise is to reduce (or attempt
to completely eliminate) any outside noise. In some record-
ing environments, this may be a simple exercise of finding
the best places to put the components. Other recording
environments may be harder to rig to reduce the amount of
incoming noise. For more on how to eliminate potential
noise, see Practice 12 on creating suitable recording settings
and Practice 13 on compressors and noise gates. 
Just remember: Post-recording noise reduction is not
always the best answer. Try to get as much ambient noise
out of the recording environment as you can. 
What to Look for in Headphones
You have a lot of headphone options to choose
from. It’s no surprise that headphones are like
microphones in the sheer range of manufacturers —
and price (from the economical to the equivalent of
a down payment on a car). How do you narrow
down exactly what you need — and what “a good
pair of headphones” should have going for them?
Closed-ear headsets
Headphones best suited for recording purposes
have earpieces that fit completely around the ear,
as shown in Figure 9-1. Other kinds of headsets rest
on the outside of the ear or fit inside the ear canal
(earbuds). While earbuds may seem preferable for
recording use, they’re not ideal for podcasters.
Closed-ear headphones allow just enough sound
in (and isolate you from just enough of the other
sounds around you) so as not to interfere with the
incoming audio signal.
Before You Jump for Those
$300 Headphones . . . 
Another way of shopping with a strategy is to know
what not to look for in headphones. High up on the
list of what not to look for is noise reduction.
Noise-reduction headphones review an incoming
audio signal and block what is designated as
unwanted ambient noise. Bose brought this technol-
ogy to the consumer with several models of noise-
canceling headphones. Other manufacturers have
been developing headphones with similar (if not
identical) technology, promising the listener a supe-
rior audio experience.
So, let’s review: Noise-reduction headphones are,
without a doubt, the best investment for listening to
audio. What you want, though, are headphones
geared more for recording audio.
What’s the difference? When you are recording with
noise reduction, unwanted ambient noise is filtered
out at the headphones. You don’t hear it. It’s still
there, and it makes it on to your recording, but you
think the audio is clean as can be because the noise-
reducing headphones are filtering out what you’d
want to eliminate if you could hear it. If your audi-
ence listens to you with noise-reduction head-
phones, they too will enjoy a relatively clean, crisp
recording and terrific audio quality.
If your listeners lack noise-canceling technology in
their speakers, car stereos, headphones, or earbuds,
they may be asking their mp3 players, “Don’t you hear
that?” Or they may leave comments on your blog, ask-
ing you to do something about the background noise.
You want to be able to hear in your headphones all
the actual sound coming into your mic and mixer.
When it comes to reducing unwanted noise, that
should happen either during the recording process
or in post-production. Noise-reduction headphones
give you an inaccurate representation of how you
sound and where your noise floor is, so we recom-
mend avoiding headphones with this feature.

Listen Up!

By narrowing your search to closed-ear headsets
(and avoiding noise-canceling headphones), you’ve
narrowed the playing field considerably.
When shopping at BSW, zZounds, or other
vendors — be it online or a brick-and-mortar
store — you might see different kinds of head-
phones, such as semi-open ear, closed-back,
and open-back headphones. These variations
on a theme are not the same as closed-ear
headphones.
Frequency response
You’ll also hear the term frequency response bandied
about for microphones in this practice; that’s
because frequency response is something that mics
and headphones share. Frequency response is a
measurement of how headphones respond to audio
signals. Audio frequencies are either exaggerated or
reduced during recording and playback, so audio
engineers look — or rather, listen — for equipment
that is equally sensitive to all frequencies (a flat
frequency response), creating a more accurate rep-
resentation of the original audio source. 
In our experience, a flat frequency response pro-
duces the purest audio overall; but because pod-
casters focus on voice, headphones that can pick up
low-frequency noise are better than those that pick
up a true flat-frequency response. That’s because
the human voice tends to produce sound and audio
nuances in lower frequencies than those of musical
instruments.
Impedance
An ohm is a unit of measurement for electrical resist-
ance. Impedance is the resistance that audio equip-
ment produces to the alternating current coming
from an amplifier. The lower the impedance, the
more power that’s required to reproduce audio.
The average pair of stereo speakers produces an
impedance of four to eight ohms. If headphones use
high impedance (more ohms), it not only takes very
little power to get them working, but also means
more power is available for additional mics and
input devices. The preamps in your mixer will not
be taxed as hard on account of that.
Listen Up!
Now that you’ve absorbed some terminology about
what goes into a solid set of headphones, it’s time
to go shopping. Take a look online or in your neigh-
borhood store for different headphones, and — if
possible — listen to various kinds of audio through
them. Ask other podcasters what headphones they
use and make a list of a few brands to consider.
Then do some careful testing to find out which ones
work best for you.
Samson CH700 ($40 USD)
Samson Technologies (www.samsontech.com) has
been busy building products for podcasters, includ-
ing the C01U, the H4 Zoom, and most recently the 
G-Track USB microphone. Along with microphones,
compressors, and other studio accessories, Samson
also makes various closed-ear headphones, offering
solid sound quality within an affordable price range.
Samson’s CH700 Studio Reference Headphones,
shown in Figure 9-1, are a reasonable step up from a
pair of Radio Shack 33-1225 headphones ($25 USD)
or similar models. The CH700 headphones offer
these features: 

Closed-ear design

20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response

64 ohms impedance

1⁄8-inch connector (with 1⁄4-inch connector
adapter)

Expecting a few friends to 
come over to podcast?
If your podcast has a single host (Moldower in the Morning,
Random Signal, Jack Mangan’s Deadpan) or a crew of two
(Two Girls and A Podcast, Technorama), the investment in
headphones is hardly a concern. However, if you start
building a motley crew of podcasters (Wingin’ It 3D, Fear
the Boot, The ADD Cast) and suddenly have a cast of thou-
sands, you will need to invest in multiple pairs of head-
phones, which can start to burn a hole in your wallet.
Fortunately, the best friend of the podcaster — the online
audio software and hardware vendor BSW (www.bsw
usa.com) — offers an economical solution for podcasters
who like their productions super-sized. For $50 USD (at
the time of this writing), BSW sells the AKG Acoustics K44
headphones in a convenient pack of three. For $90 USD,
you can also pick up a five-pack of Sennheiser HD202
headphones. These models may not give you the superior
quality of the other headphones described here, but they
will do the job of bringing everyone into the podcast with-
out breaking your bank.
Koss UR-40 Collapsible Headphones ($50 USD)
For Tee, Koss holds a very special place in his heart
as he recalls quite vividly growing up in the ’70s and
listening to his Disney albums with a pair of Koss
headphones. (In fact, the model was close to the
current Pro44AA headphones still sold today!) Sure,
they were heavy and the coiled cable didn’t give you
much mobility, but they had volume control on the
outside and sounded great. 
Now in 2007, Tee returns to that manufacturer with
the Koss UR-40 headphones, shown in Figure 9-2.
Along with a bit of nostalgia for their maker, the
Koss UR-40 headphones attracted Tee’s attention on
account of the following features:

Closed-ear design

Lightweight design

15 Hz–28 kHz frequency response

1⁄8-inch connector (with 1⁄4-inch connector
adapter)
• Figure 9-1: Samson CH700 headphones.
The CH700 headphones are good headphones to
offer guests and show co-hosts because they pro-
vide an accurate and fair representation of the
recorded audio. They may lack the range of the
Audio-Technica DH40f headphones (described later
in this practice), but they do very well in keeping
other studio participants in the know on how every-
one sounds and what is happening around them in
studio. If you’re working on a tight budget or unsure
how much you want to invest in your headphones,
the Samson CH700 headphones are a good, sure
investment.

Listen Up!

• Figure 9-2: Koss UR-40 headphones.
The main selling point of the UR-40 headphones,
though, is the collapsible feature. When podcasting
on the road, headphones are tough to pack, and
finding good collapsible headphones (not only for
good sound quality, but also for just being able to
collapse easily) that are closed-ear can prove to be a
challenge. The Koss UR-40 provides both good audio
quality and convenience of storage, and with the
included 1⁄4-inch connector adapter, the headset can
easily float around from MobilePre to H4 Zoom to
Tee’s studio rig. Durable, reliable, and ready for
travel, the Koss UR-40 headphones are a good pur-
chase for the portable podcast.
Audio-Technica ATH-D40fs ($71 USD)
After hearing Steve Eley say it again and again (and
again!) about upgrading headphones, Tee started
shopping. He found the Audio-Technica ATH-D40fs
on BSW (www.bswusa.com), and after reviewing his
budget, the features, and the set itself (in image
only), he went ahead and upgraded from his modest
Radio Shack 33-1225 to these.
Tee was simply blown away by the Audio-Technica
headphones, both in a wonderful and regretful way.
The D40fs headphones (shown in Figure 9-3) are
built to the following specs:

Closed-ear design

20 Hz–28 kHz frequency response

66 ohms impedance

1⁄4-inch connector (with 1⁄8-inch connector
adapter)

Rotating earpieces (for easy one-ear monitoring)
The headphones reproduce a crisp, clear reproduc-
tion of vocals. Every detail of your speech, every
note of background music, and even the tiniest of
special effects come through these headphones.
Tee finally understood Steve’s mantra of good head-
phones as the first studio upgrade.
• Figure 9-3: Audio-Technica ATH-D40fs headphones.

Practice 9: Upgrading Your Headphones
68
Tee also understood what some listeners told him
about his studio’s ambient noise. Along with the
details of his own voice, the D40fs also picked up
loud and clear the PowerMac G4 underneath his
desk! He was mortified at how loud his computer’s
fan was, and soon discovered that his early pod-
casts were unknowingly graced with a touch of
Macintosh ambiance.
That doesn’t mean Tee regrets his purchase. The
Audio-Technica D40fs headphones were not just a
fantastic investment for his studio. Those head-
phones made Tee a better podcaster. 
A common thread with all the headphones men-
tioned in this practice, from the Radio Shack 33-1225
to the Audio-Technica D40fs, is their design: All these
models are closed-ear headphones. Regardless of
what financial route you take in your shopping, you
will want to find a good, comfortable pair of closed-
ear headphones to catch all the nuances of your
recording sessions.
Another lesson to learn from this practice: If Escape
Pod’s Steve Eley gives the same advice more than
three times, it’s tried and true. Run with it. When
upgrading your studio, invest in a set of headphones
that works best for your rig, your needs, and you. 
Dude, this time I get to 
wear the headphones!
If you like having guests in studio or have launched a show
sporting a posse of podcasters, it’s a little weird to be the
only one all wired up with headphones to the mixer. You
want everyone to be in on the fun, especially if you’re
dropping in sound effects and voicemail calls. You want the
in-studio crew to hear what’s going on, but your mixer
board has only one jack.
An easy solution that will bring everyone into your podcast
is adding a stereo headphone amp to your studio. 
Guitar Center (www.guitarcenter.com) is not just a
haven for guitarists, but for podcasters as well. (In fact, it’s
an authorized Apple Audio Reseller, so for all your Apple
audio needs. . . .) The Guitar Center folks are also quite
knowledgeable on what you need. Before Tee could even
get out the words “stereo headphone amp,” an employee
handed him a Rolls HA43 Stereo Headphone Amp ($50
USD, pictured here). Along with a 1⁄4-inch male-to-male
stereo cable ($15 USD), the Rolls HA43 connects to the
Phones jack of your mixer, and then you can connect up to
four headphones, all of them with their own individual vol-
ume control, bringing you and your co-hosts or guests in
on the audio recording fun.

Selecting the Right
Microphone
J
ohn Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, on teaming up with director John
Landis for the 1980 film, The Blues Brothers, created comedy gold. The
humor in the film still stands the test of time, but there was always
one exchange early in the film that never really made sense to Tee:
“Where’s the Caddy? The Bluesmobile?”
“I traded it. For a microphone.”
“You traded the Bluesmobile for a microphone?! Okay, I can see that.” 
Tee never did get that joke. At least not in the first few (hundred) times
he saw it. Then he got into podcasting. A few months into Morevi, he was
watching The Blues Brothers once again, and when that moment came up,
he guffawed so loud that his wife was wondering if they were watching
the same movie.
He finally got the joke.
Microphones are a great mystery in podcasting. There are so many to
choose from — and they vary in price, some going well beyond the
$1,000 mark. Which one works for you? If you ask a podcaster, brand
names will come flying at you from every direction. Along with the brand
names, you get types of microphones. It can be a bit daunting. It can be a
bit frustrating.
It can also be a lot easier to find the right mic if you know what to look
for and how to shop.
Choosing the Best Microphone FOR YOU
Microphones to podcasters are what shoes are to Sex in the City’s
Carrie Bradshaw. You see some of the particularly pretty microphones,
USB-powered, and looking all slick in their shockmounts, and a voice in
your head whispers, “Soon, my Precious . . . soon.” It is very easy to fall
under the spell of high-tech audio toys. (We can still find the drool stains
we made during the Podcast and New Media Expo in 2006.)

array, a magnet, in concert with motion coming from
the coil, creates an electrical current. Dynamic
mics work by the same principle as a loudspeaker;
the sound is incoming (as opposed to outgoing),
but the anatomy of the two devices is so similar
that intercom systems use their speakers as
microphones. 
• Figure 10-1: Cross-section of a dynamic microphone.
Dynamic microphones are built to be durable (you
can manhandle them, pass them around, and in
some cases — though it’s not recommended —
drop them). They’re terrific for portable rigs and
question-and-answer sessions with audiences,
and they can work in any recording environment. 
Built-in microphones (such as USB headsets, an
iRiver, and iPod’s iMic) are common examples of
dynamic microphones. Dynamic microphones range
in price from a Radio Shack unidirectional (which
picks up sound from only one direction) for $20 all
the way up to the Sennheiser E945 supercardioid
(which picks up sound in a heart-shaped pattern
that isolates the sound you want from background
noise, as Figure 10-2 demonstrates). One of
Sennheiser’s supercardioid mics will set you back
$300 or more.

However, our opinion on a $1,000 microphone is the
same opinion we have on Prada shoes: If we pay
$1,000 for a microphone, that puppy is going to
make us sound like James Earl Jones when we speak
into it, edit out any mistakes in real time, cook us
breakfast, give us foot massages, and pay our bills
to the online audio mega-supermarket, BSW.
The shoe analogy works when breaking consumers
into the microphone market because microphones
share a lot in common with shoes. Not everyone is
suited for Nike. A lesser-known brand, like Saucony,
may shave off 10 or 20 seconds off your lap time.
The same thing can be said for mics: Shure micro-
phones are considered the industry standard — but
does that mean you should ignore the other mic
vendors out there? Is a state-of-the-art USB the way
to go, or will XLR give you better sound and flexibil-
ity? Where do you draw the financial lines for
acquiring microphones?
So it’s worth taking some time in this practice to cut
through the confusion surrounding what to buy —
and set out to find the right mic for you.
Taking into account where you’ll use the mic
Shopping for microphones is a science, and its
methodology involves asking yourself a lot of ques-
tions. The first question is, “Where will you be
recording your podcast?” 
On location
If you’re working outdoors or remotely, taking your
microphone to a variety of locations, fielding com-
ments and questions, and need a microphone to
pass around from person to person, a dynamic mic
may be best for you. In a dynamic microphone, as
shown in Figure 10-1, sound manipulates a thin
metallic diaphragm and coiled wire. Behind this

• Figure 10-2: Pickup pattern of a supercardioid
microphone.
In the friendly confines of a studio
If you know your podcast is going to happen in-
studio, then you need a mic that is sensitive to the
subtleties of the human voice. Condenser micro-
phones are a different breed because the diaphragm
is mounted close to — without touching — a back-
plate. As depicted in Figure 10-3, a battery connected
to both the diaphragm and backplate produces the
electrical current. The amount of charge you get is
determined by the voltage of the battery, the area of
the diaphragm and backplate, and the distance
between the two. Power for the microphone comes
either from a battery or something called phantom
power (a current coming directly from a mixer board
or preamp). Condenser mics, on account of this
setup, create the truest reproduction of sound.

• Figure 10-3: Anatomy of a condenser microphone and
how it works with sound.
However, the relatively delicate construction (and
fragility) of condenser mics means a trade-off: They
are not built for durability. Sure, you can use them
for question-and-answer sessions on your podcasts,
but passing them around from person to person
will be a pretty heavy test of how well the diaphragm
and backplate work to re-create all that shifting
sound. Also, unlike a dynamic microphone, if you
talk on the wrong end of a condenser mic (say, from
the top, or with the microphone label pointing away
from you), your voice will vibrate the diaphragm
improperly — creating interference in your recording.
And if you happen to drop a condenser mic, you’d
better start shopping for a new one.
Condenser mics produce a fantastic sound on
account of their frequency response (graphically
represented in Figure 10-4) — essentially how a
microphone responds to sound. Microphones,
depending on their design, will amplify higher-
frequency sound and then attenuate (or exclude)
audio of lower frequencies.

Perusing consumer product reviews
Before making that purchase online at BSW (www.bsw
usa.com) or Musician’s Friend (www.musicians
friend.com), take a few minutes to read the prod-
uct reviews. These reviews are posted by customers
(many of them professionals who have a track
record of repeat business with this online vendor)
who express praise or disdain for their recent
investments, provide in-the-field reports, and even
offer insight into what they’re doing with the equip-
ment. With some merchandise, the opinions may be
unanimous or strongly divided. You may need to
read between the lines and find the common thread
among product reviews.
Chatting up fellow podcasters
Along with product reviews, you also have a fantas-
tic resource to tap into that can really enlighten
you about how a product works for podcasting —
other podcasters. Podcasters love to talk about their
equipment. If you find one — or several — podcasts
whose sound quality you want to emulate, drop a
line to the hosts to find out what they’re using.
Trust me — they will love to tell you!
For tips on how to connect with the podcasting
community, take a look at Practice 32. Or check out
the last section of this practice (“Can I Take This Mic
for a Test Cast?”).
And if you think podcasters are passionate when
they fire up a mic, just wait until you ask them for
their opinions on various recording equipment.
Podcasters can provide a wealth of feedback
and critical reviews of microphones, but when
podcasters blast a particular model of micro-
phone, take the dissing with a grain of salt. It
doesn’t necessarily mean they got a bad micro-
phone; it was just a bad mic for them. When
searching for product reviews from other pod-
casters, ask why a certain microphone works
for them and their production — or doesn’t. 
• Figure 10-4: Measurement of a condenser microphone’s
frequency response.
The best microphones produce a flat frequency
response — the microphone is equally sensitive to
all sound, whether the frequency is high or low. With
no signals exaggerated or attenuated, the end result
is clear, pure audio.
A perfect, flat frequency response in any microphone
is difficult (if not impossible) to reach. But under-
standing frequency response will help you shop
for the microphone best suited for you and your
podcast.
Doing your research
Podcasters (and other people interested in podcast-
ing) are always curious about what kinds of mics
we’re using — and we love talking up what works
for us. Tee, for example, doesn’t shy away from the
$30 Radio Shack special when he finishes talking
about the $160 AKG Perception-200 because both
have their jobs; for what they do, each one performs
admirably. So it’s worth listing the tasks you want
your mics to perform before you go shopping. After
you’ve compiled a corresponding list of possible
mics to buy, the next step is to check out reviews
and gather feedback from other podcasters.

My Mama Told Me, “You Better Shop Around”
73
Okay, it’s true: Reviews and specs won’t tell
you how a particular mic works with your par-
ticular voice. So while you’re at it, ask around
at your local pro audio stores to see whether
you can try the microphones you’re most
interested in. Although many places won’t
allow you to return microphones after you’ve
bought them, they may have demo models
that you can try out in the store. It can’t hurt
to ask.
Staying within your budget
Going back to the original Blues Brothers joke (and
our own opinions on the $1,000 microphones), you
might get the impression that we’re not all about the
price tag. The $1,000 microphone has a lot going for
it, sure, but if a pricey microphone isn’t in your
budget, that should not deter you from getting into
podcasting. 
After you decide what kind of microphone will do
the job for you, you should take a look at what you
can afford. From there, you can then decide what to
begin with or what you expect to upgrade to. Cost
isn’t everything. What is crucial in your podcasting
setup is what you’ll be using the microphone for —
and whether it’s best suited for that job as you do it.
Collect feedback and reviews, look at your budget,
and then make the investment (not purchase, mind
you, but investment). While you probably could
trade a car for a microphone, it’s an option that we
do not recommend.
What we do recommend comes later in this practice.
My Mama Told Me, “You Better
Shop Around”
So what is out there? How does it measure up
and why would you want it? These are all valid
questions — and we’re more than willing to share
with you a short list of tried-and-true products that
have been terrific investments for us. Along with
the recommendations, we give you a look at how a
particular mic works in our respective rigs — and
where you can hear it in practice. These are just a
few recommendations; what you find can either be
the magic mic you’re looking for or a starting point
in your quest for the microphone best suited to you
and your podcast.
Radio Shack Unidirectional Dynamic
Microphone ($30–$40 USD)
This microphone is Tee’s workhorse. With its 25-foot
cable (the $30 model), an XLR connector to the 
mic itself, and a quarter-inch jack plugging into his
M-Audio MobilePre, Tee can pass this microphone
through an audience for any question-and-answer
sessions he hosts when his podcast is on the road
and recording live. The frequency response ranges
between 60 Hz and 16 kHz — okay, not a particularly
sensitive microphone, but its unidirectional pickup
pattern makes it easy for anyone to use. Tee just
boosts the MobilePre a bit and perhaps does some
tweaking in post-production. 
If you want to hear how the microphone sounds in
practice, take a listen to any of Tee’s Microbrewed
segments with Phil Rossi on Speaking of Beer
(www.speakingofbeer.com) or Special Edition #006
on The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy (www.tee
morris.com/blog).
Marshall Electronics MXL990 ($60 USD)
Farpoint Media’s Michael R. Mennenga, when Tee
asked for his help in setting up his first rig, recom-
mended many different components for a beginning
studio. When it came to microphones, he recom-
mended the MXL 990, shown in Figure 10-5. 

Practice 10: Selecting the Right Microphone

To hear what the MXL microphone sounds like, take
a listen to Chuck Tomasi and Kreg Steppe on

Sounds like a deal!
Always keep an eye and an ear out for sales and special
deals. Often they include sweet microphones as part of the
investment. When hired to record a podcast for both Wiley
Publishing at BookExpo America 2006 and the NIST 2006
National Conference (both in the same week!), Tee had to
put together a high-quality — yet still portable — recording
rig. Imagine his delight when Musician’s Friend was offer-
ing a free MXL 900 with the M-Audio USB MobilePre.
And just before starting work on this book, BSW offered —
with the purchase of an Alesis MulitMix-8 FireWire — a
free AKG Perception 100, shown in the following figure.
So, when you’re shopping for a new microphone or for an
upgrade, keep an eye out for deals.

duces a far cleaner, more accurate reproduction of
his voice than its Radio Shack counterpart. Tee was
quite pleased with the sound of the 990, but even
happier to find he got a shockmount (an apparatus
that holds the mic in a specific, isolated grip so it
won’t pick up sound from the stand) — and even a
carrying case — with the mic. The 990’s durable
build also makes it ready for travel, so Tee has no
problems taking it with him on the road. The MXL is
reliable, sturdy, and a terrific investment.
It’s worth repeating: The more elaborate con-
denser mics just aren’t made for roughhous-
ing. Don’t pass them around or submit them
to too much jostling. (You may want to use a
cheaper, more robust mic to cover that
regional wrestling match.)

suited for his voice. (Keep in mind that shoe anal-
ogy.) Without hesitation, he recommended the AKG
Perception: “I use a couple of AKGs in my studio,
and you sound great in them.” 
Mike Mennega uses the AKG Perception 100 at Draco
Vista Studios. With its large-diaphragm condenser
(yielding low distortion and sporting a frequency
range between 20 Hz and 20 kHz), Tee felt like he
was hearing himself all over again. You wouldn’t
think the extra 10 Hz would make a difference —
but did it ever!
The model Tee purchased was the Perception-200.
Unlike the 100, the 200 comes with two extra
features:

Bass Cut filter: The Bass Cut reduces low-end
distortion (footfalls, wind noise, and so on) and
minimizes clipping and popping problems in
close mic situations. 

Switchable Preattenuation pad: The Switchable
Preattenuation pad allows you to safely increase
the frequency range by 10 dB for close-in record-
ing, preventing overloading transformers in
mixer boards.
Tee has been thrilled with the performance of the
AKG Perception, and he highly recommends it. His
most recent podcast, Billibub Baddings and the
Case of the Singing Sword (www.podiobooks.com/
podiobooks/book.php?ID=131), can give you
an idea of how it sounds, especially with close-in
recording. You can also have a listen to The Dragon
Page: Cover-to-Cover (www.dragonpage.com) with
the aforementioned Mike Mennenga, and authors
Summer Brooks and Michael A. Stackpole.
As tickled pink as Tee is with the AKG mics, he still
uses the MXL 990 for his portable recordings. Just
because you invest in new and higher-grade equip-
ment does not mean you must stop using the reli-
able gear you’ve already implemented. 
Speaking of portable options . . .
Samson Technologies C01U Recording Pak
($170 USD)
Samson Technologies (http://samsontech.com)
was first on the scene with a mic geared specifically
to podcasters: the C01U. Priced under $90 USD,
the C01U was a big hit; condenser microphones
could only interface with a computer through third-
party audio interfaces, a mixer board, or specific
cables and adapters. The C01U provided a USB
connection — the first mic to interface directly
with the computer. Audio cards, adapters, and other
hardware were no longer needed.
This innovative mic also offered some very podcast-
friendly capabilities:

Cardioid pickup pattern

A smooth, flat frequency response between 40
Hz and 18 kHz

Ability to record at 16-bit sample resolution with
support for five different sampling rates: 8 kHz,
11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz 
The C01U led the charge for other USB condenser
microphones such as the Blue Snowball ($100 USD),
the Røde Podcaster ($161 USD), and most recently
the MXL 990-USB ($100 USD) to meet the demands
of podcasters.
USB mics are terrific options for solo podcast-
ers, but just because you can take two USB
mics and plug them into your computer’s
available ports doesn’t mean you have
Channel One and Channel Two covered. We’re
not talking stereo here. You have dedicated
USB ports, so you can use either one USB mic
or the other — not both at the same time.
With newfound competition like this, how could
Samson keep the C01U in everyone’s sights?
Simple — Samson created an easy-to-transport, all-in-
one kit (that’s it in Figure 10-6).

rig. He was impressed as the ease of setup and
strike, no-hassle transporting of the equipment,
and high performance on the road. If you’re a
podcaster in need of portability, the C01U Recording
Pak is a must-have. 
For other portable solutions in podcasting, take a
look at Practice 16.
A problem the C01U and other USB mics
have encountered (and still struggle to over-
come) is the issue of latency during recording.
Latency is when you begin to notice a slight
delay between your voice and what you hear
over the monitor while recording. The longer
you record, the more latency that builds up —
until finally what you’re saying and what
you’re hearing sound more like a distracting
echo. A common cause of this latency is lack
of RAM and too many applications running at
the same time as your DAW. Make sure you
have an ample amount of RAM installed in
your computer before recording — and be
sure to restart your computer before starting
up a new recording session. You can also
choose not to listen to yourself as you record,
an option many podcasters practice.
Final thoughts
Again, these suggestions are just that — suggestions.
The more you can find out about a mic before pur-
chasing it, the better the investment for your pod-
cast. If these recommendations provide you with
solutions, fantastic! If these recommendations lead to
other microphones, even better. What matters, in the
end, is finding the right microphone for your voice. 
So how do you go about getting the right microphone
for your podcast? Keeping with the shoe analogy,
the best way to find the mic that works best for you
is to try it on, as detailed in the next section. Record
something somewhere with the recommended
microphone and then compare it to your current
recordings.

Can I Take This Mic 
for a Test Cast?
Perhaps the best way to test a microphone is to
record with it first. While it might be hard to find a
vendor (especially an online one) who will loan you
a microphone so you can get a feel for it, you might
be able to find a local podcasting group in your area
whose members would be happy to talk with you
about investing in a microphone. They may even
invite you to their recording studios or bring their
equipment to a meeting for you to take a look at, up
close and personal. 
Here are some suggestions for seeking out fellow
podcasters:

Local podcasting groups: Do a search online for
podcasting meet up groups in your area and find
out when and where they will meet. Attend that
first meeting, introduce yourself, and make a few
contacts. 

Podcamps: You can also network with other
podcasters at podcamps — open workshops and
panel discussions on how to podcast and how
to improve the sound of your podcast. You
will find a podcamp wiki (featuring locations
of podcamps happening across the country) at
http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/.

Conferences: Conferences of all kinds, ranging
from science fiction and fantasy conventions
(Balticon, Dragon*Con, and Hyperion), feature
podcasting tracks in their programming.
Additionally, the Podcast and New Media
Expo (http://newmediaexpo.com/) features
audio vendors, show hosts, and various online
services geared to podcasting. These events are
all opportunities to network and even test-drive
new products.
These podcaster get-togethers are great
opportunities to find deals on used equip-
ment. If you feel a bit gun-shy about picking
up audio equipment from eBay, ask around at
these get-togethers, podcamps, and conven-
tions to see if anyone has equipment for sale.
You may find some very good deals and reli-
able equipment there.
If you do get a chance to try out someone’s rig, keep
the following points in mind:

Talk normally into the microphone. This is not
Good Morning, Vietnam, and you are not Robin
Williams. Avoid shouting into the microphone
you are currently testing. Talk normally, and take
notes on the model of microphone and what
kind of mic it is — dynamic or condenser. 

Ask as many questions as you can think of. Ask
about the microphone model and manufacturer,
any special features, whether it’s still being
made (so you can get parts), where the mic was
purchased, and any deals the podcaster may
know of. With a list of mic vendors, comparison-
shop both locally and online before purchasing.

Be respectful. Remember that this is someone
else’s rig. Treat the equipment with respect.
Heck, treat it as if it were a newborn: Use tender,
loving care and slow, gentle movements so you
don’t startle the podcast gear’s parent who’s
watching over you.
Turning to Podcasts for Insight
into Mics (And Other Audio
Gear)
If you are looking for more on mics, how to shop for
them, and what to listen for in their performance,
there are plenty of podcasts currently running about
microphones (and other audio equipment ideas).

Not all mics are created equal
When shopping for equipment, always keep an open mind.
Just because you strike audio gold on the first purchase does
not always mean that a particular vendor or manufacturer is
for you. For example, Thomas of The Command Line
Podcast (http://thecommandline.net) upgraded
from a simple headset mic to an Audio-Technica 3035. The
3035 was his first cardioid, phantom-powered mic. “It was
much better for midrange response than the headset mic I
tried using. I now have two 3035s and absolutely love
them.”
In need of a third mic (Isn’t success in podcasting grand?),
Thomas tried the same vendor where he picked up the
3035 and was talked out of buying a Shure SM-57/58 mic
in favor of another Audio-Technica microphone: the Pro24.
The A-T Pro24, unlike the 3035, is not phantom-powered
and produces a weak signal when running on his iMic or
Microtrack. Also, the frequency range is far narrower in
comparison to the 3035. “When I move it more than 8 or
10 inches from the sound I am recording,” Thomas com-
ments, “the signal basically fades to nothing.” Same ven-
dor, same mic manufacturer, but the microphone didn’t
fulfill Thomas’s production needs.

Upgrading Your
Software 
M
aking the jump from one software package to another can only be
described as nerve-wracking. An application becomes an old and
trusted friend when you’re podcasting. You know every nook and
cranny of the application, and swear by it even in the face of doubtful
comments from other podcasters. 
Whether you’re using something along the lines of Audacity (where the
capabilities stick to the basics) or perhaps something like Pyro 5 (where
you have multiple tracks and extra features not found in free, open-source
software), your software is the not-so-silent partner in your audio produc-
tion. You have developed a bond with it and have accomplished great
things with it as part of your team. But as with your favorite party shirt
or the trusted coffee mug that was always within reach during the long
nights of editing, you are ready to move on. Perhaps you feel a sense of
betrayal, or guilt? Why discard the ally who has worked so hard to make
you sound so good? Doesn’t the application that helped you develop your
voice in the podosphere have a say in this sudden parting of the ways?
Of course not. It’s a piece of software. Get over it.
Time to play with the Big Kids’ Toys.
Working Beyond Audacity
For many podcasters, their first audio editor is the open-source software
Audacity (http://sourceforge.audacity.net). Audacity is a good
starting point for podcasters because it is a safe investment (The soft-
ware is free. You can’t get any safer than that!) and works on a variety of
platforms. If you’re uncertain if podcasting is right for you, starting off
with Audacity is far less intimidating than firing up Soundtrack Pro (with
its many windows of options, add-ons, and the like). And if you find that
playing with audio isn’t for you, then the only thing lost in the Audacity
investment is time — nothing more. So why decide to step up from


Lack of extra features: Unlike Soundtrack Pro,
Adobe Audition, Steinberg Cubase, and others,
Audacity does not come with any free music
loops or royalty-free sound effects. Some would
argue this keeps the application streamlined, but
for podcasting use, it does limit any possible
out-of-the-box solutions. Additionally, ducking —
a popular feature in GarageBand that automati-
cally takes another track down in volume when
another begins its audio — is not available in
Audacity. (For more on ducking, jump ahead to
Practice 24 on enhanced podcasting.) Again, the
out-of-the-box solutions that these other pro-
grams offer are appealing and can assist you in
improving your podcasting productivity.

Free only goes so far: If you want to do multiple-
track recording, employ industry-standard 
noise-reduction filters, and have deeper control
over the various audio effects that an audio
application offers — even after the effect has
been implemented — you’re going to have to
shell out the bucks. A free application won’t do
all that for you. While the expensive applications
and Audacity do have similar effects, filters, and
editing tools, you get better audio results from
the built-in effects and far more control and flexi-
bility with the professional applications than
with the open-source software.
Working Beyond GarageBand
GarageBand (http://apple.com/ilife/garage
band) is the other popular first-time audio editor,
usually installed with new Macs and available as part
of iLife. Tee used GarageBand (Version 2) for Morevi:
The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana and pushed its
recording limits as far as he could. The end result
was a first podcast he is still very proud of. 
With the changes in GarageBand since Version 3,
the Mac-centric application remains a very popular
choice with both new and established podcasters. It
has even been a selling point that swayed some PC
users to purchase Mac Minis.
Audacity to another software package? If the system
ain’t broke, why fix it? Here are a few reasons why
you may want to make a switch:

Stability: Audacity users have been on the fence
about this issue since the open-source software
began to gain popularity in the podosphere. We
have heard podcasters swear up and down that
this application runs true and reliably, and that
stability is what compels them to keep Audacity
as part of their podcasting setup. We have also
heard of (and experienced first-hand) some users
who can only record so much on Audacity before
the application crashes so hard that it takes the
audio with it, leaving frustrated podcast hosts to
start over once again. 
The stability issue of Audacity is a giant question
mark. Some podcasters are willing to deal with
it, but others find that game of chance a little
too daunting — especially when, after recording
several lengthy episodes, they lose the audio
completely and have to start again.

Operating-system compatibility and conflicts:
Because Audacity is open-source software, there
is contention that some of its extra plug-ins and
user-developed (and user-approved) extensions
don’t play well with applications from Adobe,
Microsoft, and other major software developers.
Computer-conspiracy theorists may cry foul, but
open-source software can create problems with
other applications.

Lack of backup in case of a crash: As mentioned
previously, when Audacity crashes, it takes every-
thing with it — and we do mean everything: origi-
nal audio, edits, effects, and any recent imports.
When you reopen the project, you either start
from the last save, or from scratch. There is a slim
chance you can piece a lost audio recording
together out of the work files Audacity generates
(usually kept in a folder identified by the project’s
name), but that’s a painstaking process that
may not sit well with your production schedule.
Re-recording, while equally gut-wrenching and
frustrating, is far easier. In other applications,
recording sessions are saved intact elsewhere on
the computer — a far more desirable solution in
case of application or system failure.

Working Beyond GarageBand
81
GarageBand, even before podcasting came along,
had developed a good reputation in audio-recording
and editing circles, but podcasters embraced it so
passionately that Version 3 was released with out-of-
the-box podcasting solutions. With such advanced
features, solid stability, and even a backup of
recorded audio in case of an application crash, why
would you want to upgrade to a more-expensive
application (also known as digital audio workstation,
DAW for short) like Soundtrack Pro, for example?
Well, here are some points that may make you con-
sider upping your game with Soundtrack:

Limited number of built-in sounds: GarageBand
comes with hundreds of royalty-free sound loops
and effects, but eventually — depending on your
production demands — your show’s needs can
easily go beyond what those loops can do.
Expanding the basic sound library is possible
with GarageBand Jam Packs, but those addi-
tional loops and riffs are $100 per pack, which
can get costly in a hurry. Other professional
applications come with thousands of sound
loops, and you can get more mileage out of those
bigger libraries than from the hundreds of loops
that come preinstalled with GarageBand.

Technical limitations: GarageBand offers some
clever workarounds with a recording-playback
issue. After 30 minutes, we have found that
simple features like dynamic volume control
and even horizontal scrolling shut down,
making the editing process a challenge.
What makes GarageBand a preferred tool (apart
from the ease of its interface) is its multitrack
recording capabilities, which give you up to
eight separate inputs. For some podcasters,
that’s plenty; but if you’re doing roundtable
discussions, eight channels of input aren’t
enough.

Time-consuming editing process: Later prac-
tices in this book get into the difference between
destructive and non-destructive editing, but here’s
the quick-and-easy explanation of the non-
destructive variety: GarageBand allows you to
edit the audio you’ve recorded without editing
the original audio file. So if you ever want to
restore audio that was removed earlier, you can
simply go back and restore it from the original
recording. 
While non-destructive editing may seem like a
superior way to edit audio, it can add a lot of
time-intensive hassle if you make a change early
in the timeline and then you have to shift later
clips backward a second or two. The option to
edit the original audio is usually reserved for
higher-end applications — but it can cut your
post-production time considerably.
Editing audio in a destructive manner is a com-
mitment. You are saying “I don’t like this take”
or “I don’t think I need this segment.” When
the audio is removed, it may either remain in a
History (similar to the History palette in Adobe
Photoshop) or in your application’s Undo menu
until the audio is flattened. (When you dramati-
cally change the state of an audio clip such as
mono-to-stereo or resample, the history of pre-
vious edits goes away, similar to the way the
layers merge into one when you flatten a
Photoshop document.) Remember that when
you are editing audio destructively, you are
changing the original recorded audio. Any seg-
ment lost that you may find necessary later on
in the project will have to be recorded again.

Limited control of filters and effects: While
GarageBand does provide more control over
various audio effects than Audacity, even more
control and flexibility is available with higher-end
applications like Cubase, Peak, Audition, and
Soundtrack. How closely you want to control
your audio in post-production will be a factor in
whether you want to jump from GarageBand to
one of the professional audio applications.
Okay, you may never have to touch some of the
professional filters and effect applications built
into these DAWs — but other such high-end
capabilities may offer you a solution to some
long-standing production problem. Figuring out
what your podcast requires in post-production
editing will help you decide whether to stick
with GarageBand or step up to a bigger player.

the industry and one of many incredible applications
that make up the Apple Final Cut Studio. In its latest
incarnation, Soundtrack Pro (shown in Figure 11-2)
has been given vast improvements, many of which
Mac-based podcasters will find extremely beneficial:

Soundtrack’s Multitake Editor displays multiple
audio takes in a single window. After you select
the best ones, Soundtrack Pro compiles them for
a final composite — complete with crossfades
(fading down one audio source while fading
another one up simultaneously) — creating
seamless playback for the end result.

Soundtrack’s Lift & Stamp tool copies audio
effects and EQ settings from another clip —
setting them on an audio clipboard for quick
access and application or you can save the set-
tings as a preset for future use.

Soundtrack Pro now features specific functions
for producing podcasts, including audio-only,
enhanced, and video podcast formats. You can
place chapter, artwork, and URL markers with-
out leaving Soundtrack Pro, and output your
files with Compressor 3.

Similar to Audition’s Surround Encoder,
Soundtrack outputs multitrack audio projects
into 5.1 surround sound. Additionally, with
Space Designer, Soundtrack can render sound
effects and music beds that cater to 5.1 sur-
round-sound mixes (in addition to the thousands
of sound effects and loops already installed).

As with Audition, Soundbooth can show audio
signals on-screen as a spectral frequency display
so you can analyze waveforms in detail — and
edit them — using Adobe Photoshop–style tools.

The AutoComposer feature allows Soundbooth
users to create customized music from dozens of
included scores for individual projects. You can
stretch these royalty-free compositions automat-
ically to match the length of your video clips or
desired running time for your audio.

The included Adobe Media Encoder can export
audio to video formats such as MPEG-2, H.264,
RealVideo, FLV, and more. Using the built-in
export functions, you can save your files in WAV,
AIFF, mp3, and WMA formats.
What’s in a name?
Although Adobe Soundbooth is pretty impressive (even
out of the box), it seems geared more to video post-
production than to audio engineering — especially in com-
parison to Adobe Audition. Adobe Systems gives a nod
to that difference on its Web site (www.adobe.com/
products/soundbooth/compare/): 

Soundbooth is aimed at “video editors, designers
and developers who work with Flash, motion graphics
artists, and other creative professionals without a back-
ground in audio.” Translation: If you’re a video pod-
caster and looking for a less-daunting tool for
sweetening your audio in post-production, Adobe
Soundbooth would seem to be your best choice in
software. 

Audition is designed for “audio-centric professionals
such as sound designers, recording and mastering
engineers, and musicians.” Translation: If your podcast
does not deal with video or Flash in any way, then
Soundtrack Pro may not be the right option for you.
Check out Audition instead.
Before you produce plastic, 
think about the podcast
Designed for the Mac, Bias Peak LE and Pro offer a pod-
caster many more options for editing projects. However,
before you whip out the Visa or MasterCard for the
Professional Edition over the Lite, consider your podcast’s
specific production needs. It’s nice to up your game from
Audacity or GarageBand to something more polished or
high-end, but ask yourself whether your podcast’s produc-
tion values really need such a major upgrade. It is impor-
tant to remember that you should invest the time, effort,
and finances appropriate for your podcast. Will you want (or
even need) the extra features in the Professional Edition of
Peak? (Unused features are pretty expensive as mere status
symbols go.) Does the interface look intuitive and easy to
work with? 
Always review the Features pages and screen captures of soft-
ware you are considering; find out whether the application
offers something truly essential to your podcast’s production
values.

Built-in filters and options for detecting and
removing audio flaws such as hisses, hums,
cracks, and pops

Pre-installed audio filters (such as reverb, echo,
EQ, time and pitch stretching, distortion, and
chorus). You can use an Effects Rack feature on
individual tracks, combining up to five effects in
real time.

Soundbooth integrates smoothly with Adobe
Premiere Pro; Premiere even offers an Edit in
Soundbooth command. When your edits are
complete, the audio in the Premiere sequence’s
timeline updates itself automatically.

You can set and export markers as part of XML
or FLV files, and then access them using
ActionScript for timing and cueing when you’re

What will this new application bring to your
podcast?

Will its features help or hinder your production —
enhance or confuse the way you work? 

How easy or intuitive will this interface be in
comparison to your original DAW application? 
Remember that what you invest in your podcast —
finances, time, and effort — should suit the
demands of your podcast. Don’t saddle yourself
with a big investment and learning curve just
because “all the cool podcasters are using it, too.”
Deciding Whether to Upgrade
Let’s talk realistically about the U word for a
moment. It’s true — upgrading your software
requires a lot of patience. If you want to upgrade
your studio and the sound of your podcast and are
caught up in the complexities of production, that
patience is hard to find. You’ll want to install the
new digital audio workstation as soon as possible,
and then begin the arduous process of figuring how
everything works in this new application so you lose
as little production time as possible. Before making
that online purchase or heading to the cash register
with credit card in hand, take a moment to consider
the features this investment carries with it.

Creating a Quiet,
Happy Place
P
odcasting is all about the moment, about the spontaneity of life,
and about the world around us. Ambient noise, particularly in
soundseeing tours, is not only welcome but also encouraged.
Podcasters set out with every episode to capture a slice of life or give the
audience a peek at their lifestyle or environment, if the show is more for-
mal in nature. Podcasts about writing continue their discussion of world-
building or character development as birds chirp or dogs bark happily in
the backyard. Cooking podcasts press on in their recipes as the radio
plays softly in the background. The ambient noise bleeding into a pod-
cast becomes less of a distraction and more of an added dimension to
your production.
Atmosphere like this works for some podcasts, but not for all. Ambient
noise is generally unwelcome in, say, podiobooks, formal business pre-
sentations, and news reports. The content in podcasts like these would
lose some of its momentum and impact if distractions — such as the
garbage truck, the neighbor’s kids playing in the sprinkler, or a lawn-
mower — make it into the recording.
So now you take on one of the biggest challenges for podcasters —
controlling the sound that comes into your home studio. Piece of cake,
right?
Well, you can’t make batter without breaking a few eggs first. . . .
Common Sources of Unwanted Ambient Noise
Practice 4 briefly talks about creating a noise floor. No, we’re not talking
about carpeting here (though that may be part of the solution). A studio’s
recording quality is judged by its lack of sound and echo; the floor, in this
case, is defined as how much ambient noise is filtered out of a studio so
all that remains, audio-wise, is voice, instruments, or both. 
When upgrading an office to a recording studio, podcasters aim for
the floor — as low a noise floor as possible. Deadening the room —
depending on what your indoor sources of ambient noise are (computers,

dishwasher, shower, and plumbing can make your
home or apartment ping, groan, creak, trickle, or
pop while the mics are up and recording.
Children
Well, people in general can cause noise issues as
they’re outside enjoying the sunny weather, grilling
sausages for the barbecue, or hoisting a soda or
microbrew with friends to toast a baseball victory.
Just as the heavy bass of a large vehicle can bleed
into your audio, the high shrill of children at play
easily slips through walls, windows, and any other
barriers. (What is it about kids and screaming? Even
those of us who are parents still don’t understand
that!) So if the weather is particularly sunny outside
or you see the neighbors inflating a moon bounce in
the backyard for their kid’s birthday party, you
might want to reconsider recording.
Computer equipment and accessories
The new Windows and Mac machines, even with
their jacked-up and tricked-out processors, are
whisper-silent. These state-of-the-art scream
machines of number-crunching capabilities are
extremely cool . . . but unless you’re in the market
for a new computer, you are podcasting with a
computer that is far from the consistent state of
stealth mode.
Your computer may seem to be developing an
unfriendly form of artificial intelligence — waiting for
that key moment in your podcast (be it an affected
pause or dramatic tension) to kick in the fans and
stay on until you decide, “We’re done until the fan is
done.” Older computers need to stay cool; it’s a fact
of technology. Along with the computers, external
drives also need ways of beating the heat. Any com-
puter accessory reliant on fans or motors of any kind
(and that covers just about everything) offers a risk
of creating noise. While hardly as sudden or intermit-
tent as children at play or the passing UPS truck, the
noise is constant and can be a distraction.
office accessories, household pets, whatever) — can
be an easy process, but other sources of outside
noise might also come into play.
Unwanted noise can be created by anything, at any
time, by anyone. Even something as harmless as a
stress ball can make noise if passed casually from
hand to hand (or if it rolls off a desk and strikes the
carpet).
Common sources of unwanted ambient noise bleed-
ing into a podcast are described in the following
sections.
Planes, trains, and automobiles
The “quietest room” in your house may suddenly
reveal that your neighborhood is not as quiet as
you initially thought. Traffic of all kinds can make
enough noise to be picked up by your microphone;
and if you can hear that noise in your headphones,
then most assuredly your audience will hear it
as well. 
Don’t be surprised if you suddenly notice the com-
muter train’s horn from 7 miles away, the air traffic
of the regional airport 7 miles away, and the interna-
tional airport over 20 miles away. You may also
notice passing automobile traffic, especially trucks,
school buses, and the occasional hip-hop/rap/metal
fan who has the bass turned up too high. The 
low-frequency intensity of that noise sends it 
right through walls, where it can creep into your
recording.
Creature comforts
Podcasters on the whole are able to stay in great
shape. How, you ask? Simple — during the summer,
they sweat off unwanted pounds because the air-
conditioning system is disabled during recording
sessions. Not only is the air conditioning cut off, but
any ceiling fans are turned off as well. The little
things that make life easy (and comfortable) can
make podcasting very hard. No matter where you
locate your home studio, the washer and dryer,

The Podcaster’s Feng Shui
91
Much like the unassuming stress ball, some noise
can be managed. Eliminated completely? Maybe not.
But managed? Absolutely. Reducing the noise
enough so the microphone does not pick up
the sound or eliminating the noise with audio-
dampening tricks is very possible. It’s all a matter
of strategy.
The Podcaster’s Feng Shui
From the land of silk, tea, and really cool Jackie Chan
and Jet Li movies comes the (peaceful) art of Feng
Shui, defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “a system of
laws considered to govern spatial arrangement and
orientation in relation to the flow of energy, and
whose favorable or unfavorable effects are taken into
account when siting and designing buildings.”
According to the laws of Feng Shui, everything fol-
lows these laws — and if you obey them, you enjoy
a much healthier life. We didn’t really grasp how
much this discipline works until we applied it to our
podcasts.
So when it comes to a good recording environment
and a podcaster’s personal energy management,
obey Feng Shui. It’s the law. . . .
Relocating your computer
Okay, suppose your computer hasn’t yet made it
onto the list of noise generators — until the minute
after you upgrade the microphone and headphones
of your studio. Now you discover it’s making quite
the racket. How do you remedy this?
Easy. Find the closest closet in your home office.
While some podcasters (such as Nebula winner
James Patrick Kelly and superstar Scott Sigler) take
advantage of their own walk-in closets by recording
in them, you can simply move your computer in
there, as shown in Figure 12-1. You may need to
invest in 15-foot (or longer) cables for your DVI or
VGA monitors, USB devices, and FireWire devices.
You can find these extensions at any retail computer
store, making it easier to move the computer in the
closet. With the closet door shut, you’ll notice the
noise reduction immediately.
• Figure 12-1: One way to reduce noise: Isolate the
computer from the recording area. Here
the computer hangs out in the office closet. 
Make sure you close the closet door before
recording, as well as open the closet door
after your recording session is done. Heat can
build up in and around your computer, and
although the computer may be in a cooler
location now, the tight confines of a closet can
warm up quickly. So to avoid any overheating
issues or fire hazards, make sure you open the
closet door after recording ends.
If your office does not have a closet or storage area,
consider investing in an extension cable and moving
your computer to a corner opposite of where the
mic and mixer are located. Or if you’re in a small
alcove of a one bedroom-and-study apartment, put
the computer outside the study.
Before you ask: Yes, if you need to swap out DVDs or
CDs or any other removable media, you will have to
get out of your chair and walk over to the computer.
Is that a hassle? Actually, no. It gets you out of the
chair and gets blood flowing back into your legs, for
starters.

Practice 12: Creating a Quiet, Happy Place

These particular draperies, however, were not
intended to keep sunlight out (because the only
window in this room was behind the recordist); they
were meant to absorb sound. The curtain rod was
used to suspend three comforters in front of the
recordist. This idea (illustrated in Figure 12-2) comes
from podcasters Paul Fischer and Martha Holloway
of Dancing Cat Studios (http://www.dancingcat
studios.com) who effectively deadened a second-
story room of their townhome with two small
comforters.
• Figure 12-2: Comforters help deaden the sound of the
home studio Tee records from.
So how does this work? Well, when you record in a
room with only carpeting for sound control and very
little (or nothing) adorning the walls, you may
notice that your voice sounds hollow. There may
even be a slight echo in the room when you record.
The hollow sound is reverb (the natural equivalent
of the familiar echo effect produced by an amplifier
or an amplified musical instrument); that brief echo
is produced by reflection (sound waves bouncing off
hard surfaces like light off a mirror). As you speak,
the sound waves you produce go past the micro-
phone and bounce off the walls and other reflective
surfaces in the room; the more hard surfaces, the
more reflection. Hanging comforters in front of your
recording rig puts up a soft barrier that catches the
sound waves. The fabric and stuffing soak up what
would otherwise be potential reflection or reverb —
essentially stopping the waves there and reducing
the ambient noise around you.
Reducing your desk accessories
Before Tee plunged into podcasting, his desk was a
collection of knick-knacks ranging from New Age to
flat-out geeky. There was also a tech corner full of
external drives and almost no flat surface.
Shortly after making his third episode of Morevi, he
cleared off the desk — and immediately noticed a
difference in the recording quality.
The habit of having a variety of gadgets and gizmos
within reach is convenient, but fidgeting with what-
ever widget is in reach can be noisier than you
think. When you relocate the computer, relocate
the collection of external drives as well, which
should help minimize the additional noise from
them. You can easily rest your external drives on
top of the computer’s housing, or invest in a small
shelf unit and store the drives there.
Keeping your desk clutter-free and sticking to only
what you need for podcasting will give you a more
manageable and noise-free environment to work in.
Well, maybe this isn’t a secret — but it’s defi-
nitely an idea. Some podcasters who don’t
have a closet for their noisy computers often
do have a wide, two-level shelf unit. The com-
puter is situated underneath the shelf that
holds external drives; the top shelf above the
drive remains empty. When they’re ready to
record, the podcasters cover the entire shelf
unit with a comforter — deadening the sound.
As with the closet door, that’s temporary.
When the recording session is done, the
comforter is removed.
Trying a “comforting” solution
When Tee relocated his studio to the basement, he
had to consider where to put the recording gear and
in what direction the recordist should face. After
figuring out those two issues (and establishing the
direction of the desk), it was time to put the curtain
rod in place.

Patience, Patience, Patience: Waiting Out the Noise
93
Timing Is Everything
Something to consider before you record is the
time of day you’re recording. During the summer, in
particular in the afternoon or early-evening hours
(and on Saturdays), you may find that more people
are out and about. Kids are playing in backyards.
Cookouts are happening all around you. Teenagers
are working on the latest skateboarding or inline
skating stunt as seen on the X-Games. With that
much activity in your area at this time of day, per-
haps it isn’t the best time for recording.
In many neighborhoods, Friday and Saturday nights
(all year ’round) tend to be bad times to record. In a
word, the issue is traffic. Whether it’s people going
to and from the happening party in the neighbor-
hood, or people breezing (and thumping) through
on their way somewhere, cars will be coming and
going well into the wee-small hours of the morning.
Anytime is a good time to edit, of course, but for
recording, listen for some good times in the day
when activity around your home, apartment, or
office is at its lowest. You might luck out and find a
few pockets of time on a weekday evening or a quiet
Sunday afternoon that are perfect for recording. Try
to schedule your recording around these times, but
keep your mind — and your schedule — open for
opportunities. (That’s another reason to keep your
recording area neat and your equipment ready to
run — you can seize the quiet!)
Before you consider doing an early-morning
recording session, however, be forewarned
about that bird who’s up at the crack of dawn
to get the worm. It’s not easy to record when
you have feathered backup singers chiming in
their two chirps’ worth.
Patience, Patience, Patience:
Waiting Out the Noise
We’ve been taking a look at all kinds of ways to
soundproof your office without major renovations.
All right, maybe not soundproof your office so much
as make it noise-resistant; you can reduce the noise
enough to give your podcast as close-to-studio qual-
ity sound as you can get. You can move your com-
puter, move your office, or hang comforters to
deaden the ambient noise creeping into your pod-
cast. But of all the different options covered in this
practice, there is one more option — definitely the
most cost-effective method covered here, but not
necessarily economic when it comes to time — to
consider:
Wait out the noise.
When it comes to passing traffic, be it air or ground,
your microphone and headphone combination will
pick up the approaching sound. The moment you
hear the offending ambient noise, stop speaking.
Leave the recorder going, but you (and your co-
hosts, if involved) stop speaking. When the noise
subsides, pick up from a logical point in your discus-
sion, and continue forward.
When Tee was asked why it took so long to produce
a single episode of the Billibub Baddings podcast, he
always replied that two things caused the most
delay: post-production time and waiting for school
buses to pass by. There will be some ambient-noise
issues that you might not be able to wait out (such
as people walking around on the other floor, parties
next door, household appliances, and computer
fans), but when it comes to intermittent sounds
(internal plumbing in a house, air traffic, ice cream
trucks, little sonic surprises that normally take less
than a minute to go away), the most cost-effective
way of dealing with these issues is to simply stop
talking, wait the sound out, and then continue. Not
only is this a thrifty way of dealing with ambient
noise, but these points are very easy to edit out
because they appear as gaps of silence in your
recording session’s waveform. And your recording
level stays consistent, which makes the edits a lot
less obvious.

Eliminating
Ambient Noise
T
he quest for the perfect home studio is a challenge that many pod-
casters attempt to conquer after the monkey that is audio grabs
hold and finds a good grip. True, some podcasters simply don’t
care about things like ambient noise, and they record regardless of the
air conditioning, the dogs barking outside, or the like. Other podcasters
solve the issue of a quiet environment with a recording setup in a walk-in
closet (as described in Practice 12). And then some ambitious ones
invest in acoustic tiles, remove the wall between a guest room and an
office, and create a mega-studio worthy of professional productions. 
Sometimes you can find the solutions in a single piece of hardware or an
unassuming filter in Audition or Soundtrack Pro. It all depends on the
approach you adopt for reducing noise in your recording sessions.
Removing Unwanted Noise with a Noise Gate
In Practices 4 and 12, we talk about achieving a noise floor, the sound of a
room after steps are taken to filter out ambient noise, leaving only voice,
instruments, or both with little or no echo.
Hardware is available that gives podcasters the ability to tone down
some of this ambient noise. In Practice 12, we recommend hanging up
comforters, finding pockets of quiet time, and trying to take advantage of
every acoustical trick in the book — but your recording may still struggle
and long for that noise floor. This is why podcasters choose to invest in a
noise gate — a piece of hardware (usually included with a compressor,
which we talk about next) or a filter included with audio-editing software
that removes noise bleeding into microphones.
The best way to think of how a noise gate works is to imagine your studio
as a fortress. To keep an invading audio signal out, you have a gate that
closes automatically when sound of a particular decibel level is detected.
Your microphone and recording equipment record absolute silence while
the gate is closed. When you resume talking, the gate swings open, allow-
ing live audio into the microphone.

Removing Unwanted Noise with a Noise Gate
95
This is a pretty simple, tech-free analogy behind the
function of a noise gate and how it works. If you
want to find out more about gates, compressors,
limiters, and how they all fit into the grand scheme
of podcasting, take a look at Home Recording For
Musicians For Dummies, 2nd Edition by Jeff Strong
(Wiley). Jeff features detailed and easy-to-follow
explanations of how gates and compressors work,
what they do, and how to best set them for your
needs. While his book is geared primarily for musi-
cians, the recording principles remain the same;
they apply to podcasting without fail.
Setting up 
Before you apply the noise gate to your recording
equipment, you need to incorporate the compressor,
which is part of the component featured in this
practice. In this practice, we work with the Samson
Technologies S-com Stereo Compressor (shown in
Figure 13-1). This particular model functions both as
a compressor and a noise gate. (While noise gates
and compressors can be purchased as standalone
components, many compressors are also built to
work as noise gates.)
A bewildering array of hardware is out there,
so the steps offered here are for setting up
and working with one particular make and
model: the Samson S-com. While this com-
pressor may look identical to others (such as
the Alesis 3630 or the Rane DC22), they may 
not hook up in the same way as the Samson
S-com. We have tried to make the steps here
as broad and generic as possible to fit com-
pressors of all kinds — but always defer to
your compressor’s user manual if you have
questions.
• Figure 13-1: Samson’s S-com Stereo Compressor also
offers an expander, gate, and limiter, all in
one unit.
The compressor’s purpose in a recording setup is to
help normalize levels and prevent clipping (where
power output of an amp exceeds the speaker’s
power, and the audio is abruptly cut off — clipped)
when capturing louder-than-usual audio. Along with
setting limits for the loud sounds, compressors can
also improve softer dB sound quality. What you’ll be
doing with this compressor is taking advantage of its
built-in noise gate and reducing the ambient noise in
your studio.
In this section, you go through the process of con-
necting a compressor that also offers the options of
an expander, a gate, and a limiter. 
In this practice, we connect the S-com to an
Alesis MultiMix-8 FireWire mixer board. As we
stated earlier about the differences from com-
pressor to compressor, this setup procedure
may have some subtle differences from the
one your specific equipment needs. When
you’re hooking up unfamiliar equipment,
always have the user manuals (for both mixer
and compressor) on hand to aid in the installa-
tion process.
Here’s how to connect a compressor to a mixer:
1.
Make sure the mixer is turned off before
connecting the compressor to it. 
Having the computer running during this
process is fine.
2.
Plug the compressor into an electrical outlet.
Don’t turn on the compressor yet. Get
everything hooked up before you turn the
components on.
3.
Connect the compressor to the mixer. 
You may need to consult your mixer’s user man-
ual to check to see whether your mixer has
inserts (connectors for quarter-inch jacks).
If your mixer does have inserts . . . 

Practice 13: Eliminating Ambient Noise

manual, you won’t find some of the cables
mentioned here. You need to take a trip to
your closest music store or Radio Shack. 
4.
On your mixer, find the channel strip for the
microphone you want to use with the compres-
sor. In that strip, you should see a knob or
slider for Aux A. Turn it up all the way to its
maximum setting. 
For the Alesis MultiMix, this knob is red and
labeled Aux A Pre. The maximum setting reads
10 dB. The setting of the auxiliary lets you con-
trol how much of the mic’s audio signal runs
through the compressor. Do you want half the
audio’s signal to pass through the compressor
(50%), a slight adjustment of the incoming audio
(25%), or all the mic signal (maximum setting)
running through the compressor?
For the example, we want to run the whole
microphone signal through it.
5.
Turn the compressor on.
6.
Turn the mixer on.
You may need to check the user manual for your
compressor model (and that manual is going to be
your best friend, so keep it close). After you’ve
turned everything on, make sure the controls are at
the neutral setting (or default if you want to put it in
computer terms) where the compressor is operating
but not doing anything to the signal.
Setting your gate
When the compressor is connected to your mixer
and both components are running, it’s time to set
your gate. This is, by no means, your one-and-only
solution — but it is a start. 
Follow these steps to set your gate:
1.
Turn down the fader on the channel that your
mic is directly plugged into. 
For the example, this channel is Channel 1,
where the mic (in this case, an AKG Preception
200) is plugged into the Alesis.
1. Make sure you have a standard insert (two
mono connectors to one stereo connector)
quarter-inch-jack cable, male-to-male.
Just ask for insert cables at a music store or
Radio Shack; the folks there should know
what you want.
2. Connect the stereo plugs into the mixer insert
port on the channel through which you want to
run the compressor.
3. Connect the two mono cables into the available
unbalanced input and output connections on
the compressor.
The compressor may refer to the red cable as
the tip and the white cable as the ring.
If your mixer does not have inserts . . .
1. Confirm that your mixer has auxiliary sends. 
On the Alesis MultiMix-8, we’re using Aux
Send A.
2. Use a mono-to-mono quarter-inch jack cable,
male-to-male, and plug it into Aux Send A.
This cable is shown in Figure 13-2; it’s avail-
able at any music store or Radio Shack.
3. Plug the other end of the cable into an avail-
able unbalanced input connection on the
compressor. 
For this example, our available unbalanced
input is Channel 1.
4. Take a second mono-to-mono quarter-inch jack
cable, male-to-male, and connect it to the chan-
nel with a quarter-inch input jack. 
In the case of the Alesis, we’re using Channel 5.
5. Connect the other end of the cable to the unbal-
anced output on the compressor. 
Again, this is Channel 1 on the Alesis.
The male-to-male cables discussed in this exer-
cise are not part of the compressor when you
begin pulling stuff out of the box. If you are
rummaging through the contents and review-
ing the box contents as featured in the owner’s

2.
Turn up the fader on the channel you have the
compressor plugged into.
If everything is working properly, you should
have levels on both your mixer and the compres-
sor, and you should hear your voice.
So, using the Alesis setup, how is it that your
voice is coming through Channel 5 but your mic
is plugged into the (now silent) Channel 1?
Figure 13-2 shows how the compressor is con-
nected to Channel 5 of the Alesis MultiMix. That
is where the signal is coming out (as in unbal-
anced output). The signal is coming in (as in
unbalanced input) through the Alesis’ Auxiliary
A, the auxiliary that you have just told Channel 1
to send all of Channel 1’s signal through.
Get it? Got it? Good. (Thanks, Danny Kaye!)
3.
Look at your compressor’s control panel and
find the Expander/Gate section of your com-
pressor. Press the button marked Gate to put
the Expander/Gate into Gate mode.
When the button isn’t lit up, the Expander/Gate
is in Expander mode (discussed later in this
practice). When it is lit up, you’re in Gate mode.
4.
Use the knob labeled Trigger to adjust the
decibel trigger (the sound level above which
you’re telling the gate “allow audio over this
decibel level through”) for the gate. Set your
trigger point by talking into your mic as you

Practice 13: Eliminating Ambient Noise

Adjusting the gate
At present, your gate is active on its most basic set-
tings. You now have to adjust those settings to what
you want for your podcast, and here’s where you
explore the other features of your compressor.
An expander does the opposite of a limiter: Any
audio below the dB level set by the engineer is can-
celled out. In effect, an expander makes soft sounds
softer. The difference between an expander and a
noise gate is that the expander still allows the audio
to be picked up. The noise gate removes the sound
completely.
Upon reading that the noise gate removes
sound and the expander simply reduces it,
you may think it’s best never to use the
expander. Well, that depends on the settings
of your compressor and what happens during
the actual podcast. If your voice goes soft, the
noise gate may shut it out completely; the
expander just filters out the noise you don’t
want while preserving the softer vocal nuances
of your podcast. Just remember: Absolute
does not always mean better.
Your compressor also works as a limiter. A limiter
does exactly what it says: It limits the peaks in
audio. Therefore, if your volume reaches above 10
dB, the limiter stops the signal. Not all compressors
have limiters built into them, but it’s a good feature
to look for when you’re shopping for compressors.
You can also use settings of your compressor to gain
more control over your noise gate. For example, the
Samson’s S-com offers these settings:

Threshold: The Threshold setting looks for a
maximum dB level that you set. After the audio
signal reaches that level, the compressor’s vol-
ume reduction sets in. If the threshold setting is
high, reduction is never triggered. If the thresh-
old is low, any signal triggers the reduction.
When setting your trigger, don’t cut off the A/C or
silence any other devices (ceiling fans, second
computers, whatever) that may be making noise.
Leave everything running and then slowly turn the
Trigger knob up. At one point, you may hear an
audio flutter — the sound of ambient noise and
silence. This dB level is right on the cusp of what
will and will not trigger the gate. Go on and read
something — a newspaper, the owner’s manual to
the compressor, anything that you are comfortable
with — and play with the Trigger settings.
What you should notice here is that in between your
thoughts and your voice, background noise disap-
pears. This is because you are telling the compres-
sor’s noise gate to remain closed until audio at a
certain dB level is detected. The softer the noise,
the less likely the microphone picks it up. 
Right now the audio situation feels extreme — either
you get your voice coming in (along with the ambi-
ent noise) or extreme silence — and you may notice
that when your volume dips to a certain level, the
microphone doesn’t pick up the sound. That’s
because your voice is under the trigger point you
set. You can either adjust the way you speak or fine-
tune the settings of your noise gate (which is next).
What we are about to do in the next section is
one of the hardest things to get right. When
noise gates are not set properly, the end result
is worse (and more distracting) than a podcast
with ambient noise rumbling in the back-
ground. If the trigger is set on the cusp of that
earlier-mentioned audio flutter, that can create
an odd skipping sound in your audio. If your
gate is set too high, you may actually draw
attention to the ambient noise behind you as
the silence between points of audio are so
extreme. Be patient with yourself, have some-
thing to read so you can listen to what you
sound like coming through the gate, and give
yourself some time to set levels and be happy
with the end results.

Removing Unwanted Noise with a Noise Gate


Ratio: The Ratio controls the proportion of gain
reduction needed against a signal. For example,
if you set your ratio to 4:1 (the halfway point on
most compressors) and your signal crosses the
level set using the threshold, audio 4 dB above
that ceiling only produces 1 dB past the thresh-
old at output.

Attack time: After a strong audio signal runs
through gain reduction, attack time is the time
your audio takes to return to normal levels.

Release time: Release time is the opposite of
attack time — that is, the time your audio takes
to return to normal after a signal has come in
under the threshold level. For spoken-word proj-
ects, faster release times are preferred.
Some of the latest compressors reaching the
market have an Auto Attack and Release func-
tion: The compressor adjusts attack and release
times in real time, according to the dynamics of
the incoming audio signal. It’s a neat concept —
but bear in mind that if your podcast plays with
voice inflections and various levels of intensity,
an automatic approach may not be the best
option here. It does, however, allow your pod-
cast some audio flexibility. If you know you’re
going to have voices of varying dynamics, dif-
ferent emotional levels, and moments of vari-
able intensity, then fixed attack and release
times may not show off those qualities to the
best advantage. Still, experiment and play with
this new option if your compressor offers it.
Automatic attack and release may be a work-
able solution for your podcast. 
Grab some material to read aloud and position your
mic. Then you can put some final touches on the
compressor’s gate. Here’s how that process looks
for the S-com:
1.
Look for the Release button. There should be
an indicator that shows a setting for Fast and
Slow. If it’s set to Slow, change that setting to
Fast and take a listen between the two. Select
the setting you prefer.
This option is different from the Release knob on
your compressor. This release is specifically for
the Gate mode: 
 If the Gate release is slow, the return to
absolute silence is gradual. 
 If the setting is fast, the Gate “closes” quickly.
2.
Look for the knob labeled Threshold. Begin
increasing the Threshold level as you talk into
your mic, and listen for a healthy balance
between the silence and your voice.
3.
Set your attack time at just past the 50 mSec
mark, or at a level you find comfortable for
recording your podcast. 
The attack time is for louder dB levels; if your
voice isn’t that powerful and your audio isn’t
all that strong, keep the Attack below 50
mSec.
4.
Set your release time at its lowest setting. 
Because your podcast is primarily voice (unless
you have live musicians in-studio for a visit), you
may not need slower release times, so set this at
its lowest setting for the fastest release time. 
At present, you should have a compressor normaliz-
ing your audio signal in real time. You may want to
tweak and adjust your settings for a while before
you feel comfortable with them. After you have your
settings the way you want them, the compressor 
is much like working with an automated mixing
board — you won’t need to fiddle or tweak. Your
audio limits are set, and now the compressor takes
care of the rest.
Now you move on to the next microphone.
Yes, the real shock about all this is that you have
effectively applied the compressor to one channel —
only one. If you want to have two microphones run-
ning through your compressor, you must repeat these
steps for the compressor’s next available channel —
and the settings are different for each make and
model of compressor. Some compressors handle only
one channel at a time; the Samson S-com can handle
two microphones at once.

We use Adobe Audition or Soundtrack Pro for this
portion of the practice. The first order of business,
however, is to find the file and preview it in the DAW
of your choice:
1.
From the book’s DVD, import the audio file
Billi-Ch14-Cabbie.aif into either Audition
or Soundtrack Pro.
2.
Press the spacebar to play the clip. 
Because the loop playback is active, the clip of
the audio loops.
3.
Open the Noise Gate window in whichever dig-
ital audio workstation (DAW) you currently
have running. 
The voice talent for this audio file was recorded
in a room with very little acoustic dampening, so
you want to use the Noise Gate in your software to
remedy that problem. The following sections show
you how to improve the sound in Audition and in
Soundtrack.
Using Audition
With Audition running, we run this example through
the built-in compressor filter. To improve this audio
in post-production, we perform the following steps
that work like gangbusters for us:
1.
Drag the audio file to the main multitrack win-
dow, drop it there, and then select the Edit
mode to edit the selected audio clip.
2.
Go to the Effects panel (nested behind the Files
panel), expand Amplitude, and double-click
the Dynamic Processor option.
Alternatively, go to the Application Menu and
choose Effects➪Amplitude➪Dynamic Processor.
3.
From the presets, select Noise Gate @ 10 dB for
your starting point of adjustments. 
If you want to hear the audio as you change it,
click the Play button in this interface.
We’ve focused on condenser microphones as
our in-studio microphones of choice, but one
disadvantage of condenser microphones
(compared to dynamic mics) is that con-
densers cannot plug directly into compres-
sors. (Dynamic mics can.) If you decide you
have to plug a condenser mic directly into a
compressor, you have two options, and both
do the same thing: provide power. Remember
that condenser mics need it — usually in the
form of phantom power (more about that in
Practice 10) — to run. You can either install
a battery inside the mic, or buy an external
power source that connects between the mic
and the compressor.
Reducing Noise in 
Post-Production 
Perhaps you don’t have an unlimited budget right
now (as many podcasters will attest without hesita-
tion), so a compressor may be temporarily out of
reach for your ever-growing studio. However, when
you listen to your recording sessions, you realize
that even after all that hard work to eliminate noise
(hanging comforters off curtain rods, banishing the
computer to the office closet, or recording only
when the noise in your neighborhood is down to a
dull roar), you still have a hint of distraction: just
enough ambient noise to bother you.
Now the good news: Applications such as Audition
and Soundtrack (shown in Figure 13-3) come with
fully working compressors, noise gates, limiters, and
expanders. A whole digital toolbox awaits on your
call to work a little post-production magic.
Open your Noise Gate filter in Audition or Soundtrack,
and you see many of the same options discussed here.
Open the compressor, and you see features such as
Threshold, Ratio, Attack, and Release — all of which
behave identically to their hardware counterparts.

Reducing Noise in Post-Production
103
Using built-in noise-reduction filters: 
Too good to be true?
With post-production noise gates and compressors,
you have a built-in option to deaden echo and
reduce some ambient noise that has bled into
your recording sessions. Or you can adjust the
dynamics of audio signals sent in by others for
your podcast.
You can add these filters destructively to audio
sources, or you can apply the noise gate and com-
pressor to the track itself, adjusting the ambient
noise evident in a clip in a non-destructive manner.
You can find the Noise Reduction filter in Soundtrack
under Process. In Audition, the filter is under the
Restoration submenu of Effects. (Both filters are
shown in Figure 13-4.)
While both DAW applications accomplish the same
goal, Audition and Soundtrack go about attaining
that goal in two different ways:

With Soundtrack Pro, you control the noise
threshold, adjust the amount of reduction to
apply to the audio, and tell the filter to preserve
either the bass or the treble. 

With Audition, you create or use a sound profile
from a built-in library. From here, the Noise
Reduction filter adjusts the results to fit both
that profile and your changes.
When using Noise Reduction filters, you want to
avoid overcompensation. Too much noise reduction
in post can muffle the sounds you want to keep or
create artifacts — unwanted audio side effects, such
as a clipping or a flanger-like effect on your voice
that’s usually associated with too much compres-
sion in your final mp3. While the Noise Reduction
filters can improve the quality of dodgy audio, they
can’t turn lead into gold. Use them with an alert ear
and a clear head.
• Figure 13-4: Audition (left) and Soundtrack (right) offer noise reduction, but each has a different way of achieving the
same goal. 

Practice 13: Eliminating Ambient Noise
104
exploring the more obscure software options, work on
getting your recording environment as quiet as possi-
ble. Basics first.
Noise reduction in recording versus noise
reduction in post-production
Compressors, expanders, and noise gates can help
reduce the unwanted ambient noise of your record-
ings, but they can’t magically project Maxwell Smart’s
“Cone of Silence” around you while you’re recording.
“What, Chief?”
We said, these devices are not built to make your
recording environment perfectly silent!
Your goal, as you improve the sound of your podcast,
is to create a quiet-as-possible recording environment
for you and your show. The compressor hardware
helps you with that before you hit Record — but the
cleaner the audio you record, the easier you can edit
it later in post. Post-production should be a time for
final touches, flourishes, and the last-minute edits,
but many podcasters find that the lion’s share of their
work has somehow wound up here. They toil for
hours to clean up audio from other sources or spruce
up their own recordings. 
Does this mean you can’t improve your recordings
in post-production if your budget does not allow for
a Samson S-com Stereo Compressor or similar unit?
Sure, you can still improve the signal with software
plug-ins and filters, but a lot of that work is taken
care of already if you eliminate the noise before it
reaches the microphone. The software can reduce
any noise left over after you create your dead audio
room, but keep in mind that the background noise
isn’t all these filters are working on. They also affect
the voice in the foreground. It’s all noise to them.
Filters are terrific tools, but they can’t differentiate
between your voice and the air conditioning. The
best noise reduction is all that careful listening and
preparation you do before a single syllable is
recorded.
Finally, accept that the powerful tools technology
provides aren’t miracle workers. Sometimes you
will have unwanted noise in your audio. Ambiance
happens.
The Best Noise-Reduction
Device: You!
There’s a reason why it’s called noise reduction —
realistic expectations. Noise reduction does not
mean noise removal. You cannot have a fan running
or the vents open in your office and expect the
noise-reduction features of Audition or Soundtrack
Pro to pick them up and say, “Not a worry. Let 
me take care of those for you.” Noise-reduction
devices — compressors, noise gates, and filters —
do not discriminate between you and the offending
ambient noise. It’s all noise to the hardware and
software. 
Your best option for noise removal is to create a
quiet, happy recording place for yourself. The
devices and filters we cover in this practice are tools
to help you create the ultimate home studio, but they
won’t do it for you. Some of the sharpest wits and
most professional voices in podcasting — the likes of
Leann Mabry, Phil Rossi, and George Hrab — all use
compressors and noise-reduction tools in both the
recording and in post-production, but what these
podcasters share in common are the steps they take
to create a near-ideal recording session. Read on.
Take control of what you can
Before recording, listen to what’s around you. If the
air conditioner is running, turn it off. Fans, space
heaters, or ionizers should also be powered down.
Now listen for any other devices in your office that
make noise — external drives, clocks, fluorescent
lighting, or other office accessories. The only thing
left to do is check the sound quality of the room. Is
there still too much echo in the room? Do you need to
adopt the comforter-and-curtain-rod trick mentioned
in Practice 12? Before investing in new hardware or

One-Take Wonders
P
odcasting is all about the impulsive moments in life, the raw and
unedited perspectives of hosts on the world around them. Life is
captured in the moment, thoughts are from the heart and soul,
and the listenership dives deep into the show host’s id — all thanks to a
podcast episode recorded in one masterful take.
Sure, easier said than done.
Recording in one take does sound as if you’re throwing caution to the wind;
and while podcasting is associated with audio productions peppered with
stammers, flubs, and moments of brash honesty, a science is behind the
spontaneity. Podcasts can be recorded in one take and can sound polished
and refined. One-take recording takes a bit of planning, though, and some
forethought before hitting that Record button.
And You’re Recording! (Good Luck.
You’ll Need It.)
Simply sitting in front of a microphone, hitting the bright red button of
your DAW (digital audio workstation), and talking is truly an affirmation
of self-confidence. You’re stating to yourself and to the world that your
message is ready to be heard, and there is no need for show prep, edit-
ing, or even session planning. Just your voice and a microphone are all
that’s needed.
To accomplish this feat for five minutes — recording thoughts in a coher-
ent manner — is something to be proud of, but try it for ten minutes, and
it becomes a bit more daunting. Go ahead and give it a whirl. Fire up your
studio or portable rig and try talking with no notes, no prep time, and no
inhibition about something you’re passionate about. Sports. Religion.
Politics. Movies. Just try to coherently talk into a microphone for ten min-
utes off the top of your head. Hey, that’s okay, we can wait. We’ll be right
here when you get back.

Welcome back. Your head hurts a little bit, doesn’t it?
And we wouldn’t be surprised if your tongue feels
like it’s been lifting barbells. Trying to carry on a
ten-minute unscripted conversation isn’t easy, is it?
Now maybe the thought “This is a lot easier when
I’m out with friends . . .” or “Man, I can type out ten
minutes of material on my blog easier than this . . .”
might have crossed your mind, but podcasting isn’t
the same as a social gathering with friends or a sit-
down at the blog where ten minutes pass by in a
blink. This is, simply put, improv.
We’re the first to agree that improvisation of any
kind isn’t easy. Improvisation and fast thinking may
come easier to some than others, but even the
brightest and most intelligent can’t sit behind a mic
and go on a whim. It’s a challenge to sit behind your
rig and produce a show in one take. It puts a great
amount of pressure on you, especially if you haven’t
given yourself time to think through what you’re
talking about in this week’s or this month’s episode.
Recording a show in one take, however, is not
impossible, as we explain next.
The Method in the One-Take
Madness
No matter how brilliant you may think spontaneous
podcasters sound, a science is behind what they do.
Even these improvisational hosts themselves may
not think they do anything special beyond firing up
their recorders and going for it — but there is. No
matter how basic or organized the method is, it’s a
method — a plan for what they’re about to say.
So what are you going to say?
If you’re working alongside a co-host or several
hosts, the conversation tends to record a little better
when you discuss the ideas and direction you want
your podcast to follow before you start recording
that particular episode. Canadian podcasters Chris
and Eliza do just that as part of their show prep for
Two Girls and a Podcast (http://twogirlsand
apodcast.libsyn.com; see Figure 14-1). Their show
takes a cue from Jim Henson’s legacy, Sesame Street,
by “sponsoring” their various episodes with letters
(D is for Doctor Who, S is for Summer Movies, and so
on). The show then follows the topic with copious
amounts of speculation on why Canadians get their
science fiction at different intervals from their U.S.
counterparts, what they are currently geeking over,
and why Stargate: Atlantis’ Rodney McKay (David
Hewlett) isn’t arrogant, just misunderstood.
Oh yeah, and there’s giggling. Lots and lots and lots
of giggling. (And for us, that’s part of Two Girls and a
Podcast’s appeal.)
• Figure 14-1: From Canada, Chris and Eliza keep the chat
lively with their slice-of-geek-life offering,
Two Girls and a Podcast.

The Method in the One-Take Madness
107
If you try to script your show, you’re committing to
a certain level of development and writing, and
steering the course of the show. There’s nothing
wrong with scripting a podcast, but when you do,
you face a large amount of pre-production work.
Even if you save time by getting your podcast
recorded in one take, you wind up investing more
time in writing your episode.
Writing show notes takes far less prep time
than a fully scripted show, and these notes
can be as detailed as you make them. While
not as thought-out or developed as scripts,
show notes can help you keep the show on
track. They also give you room to improvise
and explore tangents on the topic your cur-
rent episode is about.
Pacing your podcast
Podcasting in one take can be tough when you’re
trying to get on the same train of thought with your
show’s co-host, but nailing that one take can feel
even more daunting when the only voice in the
room is yours. How do voices like Nicole Simon
(http://usefulsounds.com), Mur Lafferty
(http://murlafferty.com), and Dan Klass
(http://thebitterestpill.com) manage to
sound so good with only one take under their belts?
When you listen to solo podcasts, listen to how they
sound when speaking. You may notice that their
vocal patterns and pacing are, on the whole, very
deliberate. Not slow, but deliberate. These podcast-
ers take their normal, everyday speech cadence and
relax their delivery by a second or two. 
Recording at a deliberate pace offers many advan-
tages. You may sound slower-than-normal when
recording, but what you don’t hear is that subcon-
scious excitement — that podcaster’s passion —
creeping into your voice. This passion tends to
tweak up your adrenaline levels; while subtle, it
does affect your voice and diction. Slowing down
your delivery improves diction, keeps you relaxed,
and gives you a moment or two to think about what
you want to say next.
“We are very much the one-take recording podcast-
ers,” Elisa admits. “We would never intentionally
record a show twice. ‘Show prep’ is one of us has an
idea for a show, and we mention it to the other to
see how they feel about talking about it. Some topics
we can discuss right away; some need to be post-
poned until we are both up to speed.”
The show’s spontaneity comes in deciding not only
what they talk about, but also when they talk about
it. “Once decided, we don’t overtalk the topic
beforehand, usually just some points that we think
we should discuss during the show. Sometimes we
hit those points during recording, but oftentimes,
we go in a different direction altogether.”
Where Two Girls . . . succeeds so brilliantly is that
with just an idea of what they want to talk about,
Chris and Eliza create a charming half-hour chat that
the world is invited to listen and even give feedback
on through voicemail, blog comments, and e-mails.
No script, no notes — just an understanding of the
topic they need to stick to as best as they can
(amidst the giggling, of course). On occasion they
manage to surprise one another, but the surprises
are in tune with the podcast; neither host tries to
one-up or outdo the other. This show is a great exer-
cise in host chemistry and teamwork, creating a
delightful sit-down with two friends from the Great
White North.
Working with notes and scripts
Perhaps the easiest way to make sure you get your
message across in one take is to write down what
you want to say, read it aloud a few times, and then
record it.
Notes and scripts (discussed in detail in Practice 5)
guarantee you that your thoughts are down on
paper. If your notes or your script are detailed
enough (but not too obsessively so), you shouldn’t
have a problem remembering what you want to say
and how you want to say it. Then all that remains is
for you to express it however you wish.

Practice 14: One-Take Wonders

Recording in segments
Another smart approach in one-take podcasting is to
record your show in segments as opposed to one-
take, beginning-to-end, 30-minute marathon recording
sessions. For the earlier-mentioned podcasters, their
shows — whether clearly by a title or going from one
topic to another (simply by saying, “Something else I
wanted to talk about . . .”) — break up the podcast
into individual sections.
In her writing-and-cultural podcast, Whispers at the
Edge (http://whispers.libsyn.com), New Zealand
author Philippa Ballantine offers a section called
Pip’s Picks, where she offers book reviews. In
Mur Lafferty’s I Should Be Writing (http://ishould
bewriting.com), Mur features a section where she
discusses what she has done to further her career,
whether with agent queries or publisher submissions.
(See Figure 14-2.) And then there is the popular
“Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Moment” (from The Survival
Guide to Writing Fantasy) where authors, agents, and
publishers are asked, “What were you thinking when
you did that?!”
• Figure 14-2: Pip Ballantine’s Whispers at the Edge (left)
and Mur Lafferty’s I Should be Writing
(right) are writing podcasts that use show
notes and segments to pace each episode. 
It may not seem exhausting, but recording nonstop
for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or (yikes!) an hour can
tax you. Your brain is firing on all cylinders, and
your voice hasn’t let up since you hit that blinking
red button. Instead of pushing yourself to an extreme
limit or trying to complete the show in one massive,
mammoth weeknight (or weekend afternoon) of
recording, why not break your show into segments?
Record 10 minutes here, and 10 minutes there. The
post-production time is manageable, and you also
leave room for promos (described in Practice 29)
and listener-produced contributions.
By pacing the delivery and the production of your
podcast, one-take recording is an easier feat to
accomplish. Remember that no one, save for you, is
keeping time. Find logical breakpoints in your show
and use them to pace your delivery. From there, you
can make the one-take podcasting happen.
Author, podcaster, and monotone voice-talent-
extraordinaire Jack Mangan, in his appropriately
titled Deadpan, has one-take podcasting down to a
science. He is able to consistently produce a 30-to-40
minute show without breaking a sweat. His two-part
secret: (a) do the show in segments, and (b) incorpo-
rate listener contributions.
Jack’s show segments are as various and random as
his show’s content. You never know what’s coming at
you with every new Deadpan, but when you hear the
show segment’s intro, you smile because you have
an idea. Jack’s vignettes include “Highbrow,
Lowbrow” (a sophisticated moment of humor, cou-
pled with a juvenile joke), “Unrelated Thought”
(the unexpected left-field comment Jack has filed
away at that particular moment), and “Interviews
with Famous People” (where we hear Jack typing
on a keyboard, a pause, and then more typing —
comedy gold!). Jack also features listener content,
ranging from serialized fiction to “The Contents of

What You Gain with One-Take Recording

it depends on how much you want to edit in
post-production. However, even with minor cuts
here and there, the moment between you and
your show’s hosts or special guests — or those
moments of unabashed honesty spoken with
your microphone taking it all in — are preserved
for your listeners to appreciate. 
Take a moment, remember why you’re doing
this podcast, and then start talking. And allow
yourself to enjoy the ride. The enjoyment
comes out in your podcast, and your audience
catches it from you.

Quick post-production work: If you record an
entire episode or show segment in one take,
your final editing and post-production can be
measured in fast mouse clicks. Drop in your
introduction segment, position your latest
episode accordingly, and then drop in your
outro. Your podcast is now ready for exporting,
compression, and tagging. 
If you want to check any segments for ahs and
ums that might detract from the confidence of
the podcast’s message, then you can go back
and remove them, along with any unnatural
breaks or pauses in your podcast. Instead of
requiring hours dedicated to editing, your pod-
cast is prepped and ready for the final steps in a
matter of minutes.
One-take podcasting is not a secret, but a skill —
just like anything else in this medium. The profes-
sionals make it look easy, but even for them it isn’t.
How seasoned and experienced broadcasters, voice
talent, actors, and comics make this process look as
easy as taking a breath is they do just that: They
take a breath. Give your episode (and yourself) a
direction and have a little fun following that direc-
tion. After you get used to taking just a moment to
think about what you’re going to say before you hit
Record, you’ll probably find that one-take podcast-
ing cuts your editing time dramatically, and you 
can produce segments and shows efficiently, even
effortlessly.
What You Gain with One-Take
Recording
On the surface, podcasting in one take can seem out
of the realm of possibility unless you hire seasoned,
experienced radio personalities or one brilliant
stand-up comedian for your show host. With a bit of
planning, some rehearsal, and one deep breath (to
start with, anyway), a podcast can happen in one
take. Sure, there’s some pressure to deliver once the
mic goes hot, but it is possible.
But why subject you or your show hosts to that kind
of stress? Recording in one take isn’t as stressful (or
as difficult) as it appears on the outside, listening in. 
There are also some real perks:

Economy of time: When you plan your episode,
you have a roadmap to follow to reach your des-
tination. That takes you roughly an hour, maybe
two. Then, when you hit Record, you’re off and
running — pacing your delivery, taking your time
to talk clearly about the episode’s topic, and
allowing yourself, your co-host, or your guest a
little time for some fun on the podcast. Ten or 
20 minutes later, that segment or episode is com-
pleted. Now comes the time invested in ID3 tag-
ging (see Practice 25) and posting show notes.
Your podcast is ready to go in three hours. 
One-take podcasting is a terrific way to produce
multiple segments or shows in one day. If you
need to economize your time, getting good at
one-take podcasting can help you make the most
of the time you have.

Spontaneity: Podcasting, no matter how you
edit in post-production, is all about the moment
you record — capturing life in audio or video
as it happens. The best way to keep that
spontaneity — as heard in Fear the Boot,
Christiana Ellis’ Hey Wanna Watch a Movie, 
and Ronald D. Moore’s Battlestar Galactica
podcasts — is to hit Record and let fly. How
brash and honest your podcast is when you post

A
little bit of editing goes a long, long way in podcasting. It’s debated
that once editing and post-production occur, the podcast really
isn’t a podcast. It’s no longer that spontaneous, impulsive slice-of-
life captured in audio, and nothing different from what you’ll find in
radio, television, or other mainstream media.
Why can’t podcasting meet those standards?
Spontaneity, impulsiveness, and the “Fireside Chat” nature of podcasting
can still be there; but depending on the project, you may need (or want)
multiple takes to choose from. Sure, it’s going to demand more work
from you, and it will also test your editing skills, but the end result may
be that your modest podcast turns the heads of industry pros and broad-
cast veterans.
Challenge yourself — see what your creativity can yield.
Multiple Takes: Variety Is the Spice of Life
(And Podcasting)
We truly admire one-take podcasting (see Practice 14) — that incredible
(and somewhat daunting) ability to hit Record and create a podcast. It
really does take a fair amount of bravery, skill, and just plain chutzpah to
pull off a podcast like that. In many instances — interviews, symposiums,
seminars, and speaker panels, you name it — you’re given no other
option; you have to capture the audio as it’s happening. 
Some audio projects, though — training sessions, dramatizations, formal
readings, and promotional pieces, for instance — may work best if you
take the opportunity to record the same thought or expression with a dif-
ferent intent, correct a mispronunciation, or smooth a slip-up. Recording
multiple takes provides you, the editor, with a wider variety of options
for you to build your podcast on and around. The more raw material
you have to pull from, the more polished and refined you can make your
podcast.

Learning Tricks in the Take
111
Learning Tricks in the Take
The take (just so we’re clear on what it is) is the
recording of a segment followed by a marker in the
audio or video, and then the segment is recorded
again (sometimes in the same recording session) to
see whether it can be done better or differently. 
For example, if you’re recording a scripted segment
of a podcast and you read, “Now is the time for all
good podcasters to stand up and be edited,” that
would be considered Take One. When you repeat
the line a moment or two later, your emphasis on
good as opposed to podcasters would be considered
Take Two. And so on. You then compile these multi-
ple takes into the final production; your editing
makes the thoughts appear continuous and flowing.
From Hollywood comes the concept of a
safety take: An actor or a group of actors can
shoot the same scene from various angles
until the producers, directors, or both are sat-
isfied. Even after a specific take feels right, a
director — or in some rare cases, an actor —
will ask for a safety. The scene is set up again
and shot one more time as a backup in case
anything is discovered that cannot be reme-
died (a lighting problem missed during shoot-
ing, background interference missed by the
sound guy, whatever) in post-production.
Podcasters, when working with multiple vocal
talents, should consider safety takes. You may
not need them, but in many cases, the safety
takes outshine the takes you initially thought
were right for the production. 
One problem in working with multiple takes is know-
ing where one take stops and another one starts.
Without proper markers in the audio, it can be easy
to skim by two takes and leave a repeated phrase or
expression in your editing wake (D’oh!). Therefore,
you need quick-and-easy ways to leave notes for
yourself in your audio to let you know when a take
begins and ends.
Audio and video podcasters have a few simple tricks
up their sleeves that help make their editing sessions
more efficient and productive, even with so much
audio to listen to and evaluate. Here are some in-
studio and on-location methods that may help you:

Pause for a moment. In between takes, simply
wait five to ten seconds and then resume your
thought from the point of the mistake or from
the beginning of the segment. In your audio,
these quiet moments appear as long, flat lines.
You can then easily hop between segments of
audio, find the takes you prefer, and then com-
pile them into the final version.

Create audio markers. Some podcasters will
snap fingers; others use a click of the tongue.
You can even make a trip out to the local pet
store and pick up a dog trainer’s clicker, as
shown in Figure 15-1. The intent of an audio
marker, no matter what makes the sound, is to
create sharp spikes in your audio. This makes
searching for takes easy. 
• Figure 15-1: Dog clickers like these create spikes in audio,
making edit points (and mistakes) easy to find.

Practice 15: Multiplicity: Recording Multiple Takes

audio equals 10MB (give or take a megabyte). If
you have recording segments totaling up to a
running time of 1 hour and 30 minutes, you’re
inching close to 1GB of uncompressed audio.
These sessions can quickly stack up on you if
you’re recording multiple takes.

Timing multiple takes together: As mentioned
earlier in this practice, timing together two sepa-
rate sessions takes practice. You want the seg-
ments and sessions you edit together to sound
like one cohesive recording, one concise expres-
sion. Sometimes editing your sessions together is
merely a matter of timing the breaks between
words and phrases. Other times, you’re editing
audio beat for beat. And then there are those
edits that sound seamless out of sheer luck. No
matter your skill level, editing your takes together
requires a lot of patience and time to get it right.

Editing time: Editing multiple takes together
takes time. Recording segments two, three, or
more times over and over again takes time.
Reviewing edits so you don’t have any repeat
statements or missed mistakes takes time. Unlike
the one-take podcast, the multiple-take approach
increases your editing workload exponentially. It’s
a trade-off you make when you go beyond the
simple podcast: To get more variety in the audio
you create, you have to invest more time in listen-
ing, editing, and reviewing it for timing, flow, and
continuity, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Understanding the Advantages
of Multiple Takes
We can imagine the interior monologue at this point:
“More editing time? Skill? Practice? Wait a second —
I thought I was podcasting! You know, what Steve
Jobs described as the Wayne’s World of audio and
the media professionals huff at as being amateur
hour. This is starting to sound as if there’s a lot of
work involved in engineering audio at home (or at
the office).”

Record in segments. You record a segment, mis-
takes and all, until you reach its end. You stop
recording. You then begin recording again. In
digital audio workstations such as Audition,
Soundtrack, GarageBand, and Pyro, these ses-
sions appear on your track as segments of
audio — all independent of one another. You
can then check each take for quality and compile
them like a jigsaw puzzle. 
When you’re doing multiple takes, there’s
nothing wrong with combining half of one
segment and another half of a later segment.
However, if you stumble in the middle of your
take and then pick up the second take from
the moment of the mistake, editing the seg-
ment becomes far more difficult. Words can
easily run together, even with the best diction.
If you’re recording multiple takes, it’s better to
start from the beginning of the material (or a
logical break between two phrases). The prior-
ity here is to make the edit practically unno-
ticeable; the goal is a smooth and continuous
end result. Make your editing easier and find
logical editing points within your takes.
The Demands of Multiple Takes
While you’re working on giving your editor and your
podcast a wide range of audio to choose from, it’s
time to consider the way this approach to podcast-
ing changes your in-studio procedures. Editing
needs change dramatically between the one-take
podcast and what you’re doing now, but that’s only
a part of how your podcast is put together.
With multiple takes, you must now take these points
into account:

File storage: With every take you record, another
part of your disk space is taken. Whether it’s one
long take with audio markers or a series of takes
broken up into smaller segments, your record-
ings will take up space. How much space? Well,
consider that every minute of uncompressed

Understanding the Advantages of Multiple Takes

Podcasting is like any creative endeavor: You get
what you put into it. Podcasting can be the low-
budget, economical investment of finances, time,
and resources that it continues to be portrayed as;
but it doesn’t have to stay on a shoestring budget if
you don’t want it to. Modest purchases, a dedication
to the project’s audio quality, and a bit of clever
thinking can help you develop and engineer a pod-
cast that rivals studio-quality productions.
So now that you’ve had a look at the costs of work-
ing with multiple takes, here is what you gain from
this increased workload:

Variety in audio and vocal range: Unlike the
one-take wonder, you have a choice of line read-
ings. Even if your material is far from high drama,
you can try difference paces with your script,
emphasize certain words in the material, and
play around with different volume intensities.
You can now give your material an aural texture
that may not be present in a one-take podcast.

Polished product: What’s considered the “charm”
of one-take podcasting consists of the unedited
stammers and stumbles that some show hosts
make when recording. With multiple takes, ahs,
ums, and repetitive words — such as but, so, and
(of course) and — are easily removed from the
beginnings of thoughts and snipped out of the
middle of long replies or commentary. Result:
The whole thing sounds more impressive.
Using the multiple-take approach, you can also
clean up the time between thoughts, shorten (or,
for some tension, lengthen) pauses in your show
hosts’ comments. When you can control the tim-
ing and variety of the final work, the end result is
a refined podcast, featuring only the best takes
and the sharpest timing. 
• Figure 15-2: Projects using multiple segments (like this in Soundtrack Pro) increase the time demands on you as a
podcast producer. 

Practice 15: Multiplicity: Recording Multiple Takes
114
But before working in this edit-intensive state of
mind, it’s worth asking whether your podcast
warrants — or really needs — this kind of time
and effort. Perhaps the one-take podcast and 10 
minutes of quality time between you and the micro-
phone is all you need; or maybe you want to con-
sider allotting more time and resources to your
podcast. The question you should be asking your-
self is, “Am I investing the right amount of time and
effort for this podcast?”
Not all podcasts are created equal. Each podcast,
depending on its ideas, execution, and post-
production needs, will demand your time, effort,
and (to some extent) emotional wear and tear.
When you begin planning out those first five shows,
take a moment to ask yourself, “Does the investment
match the basic needs and direction of this pod-
cast?” By taking a good, realistic look at what you
want to do with your podcast, you can get a good
handle on how to proceed.

Editing education and practice: Practice makes
perfect, and perfect practice makes for incredi-
ble podcasts. With every editing challenge, you
will learn skills that only help your productions
mature and evolve into something better than
the afore-mentioned “Wayne’s World of audio”
that podcasting still tends to be regarded as.
There will be moments of trial, and a few errors
should be expected, but each edit is practice for
a future situation: Before long, you’ll have the
confidence and finesse to think, “I’ve done this
before. No sweat.”
Deciding Whether the
Investment Is Worth It for You
Creating podcasts with multiple takes requires a
serious time commitment, but the end result is a
production easily ranked with the most polished
and professional of audio offerings. By having a vari-
ety of samples to choose from, you can do a lot
more than create a podcast. You can create an
exceptional podcast.

Podcasting from
the Road
R
ecording in your own studio is a lot like being Batman. You retreat
into that section of the house or apartment reserved only for you
or your closest companions, surround yourself with high-tech
equipment, and test your skills before an audio rig and computer eagerly
awaiting input. When Tee was moving his studio from the upstairs office
to the basement, he asked the wife if he could build a slide-away book-
case in the foyer with either a high-speed elevator or a fireman’s pole to
slide down into the heart of the recording sanctuary.
That idea was quickly shot down. The jury is still out on the underground
garage, its entrance concealed by either a waterfall or a folding Danger:
Dead End sign. (No, really, podcasters need that.)
Why, you ask? Because sometimes you need to take your show on the
road. In this practice, you assume the journey of an audio ronin, facing
the challenge of capturing quality sound outside the studio. You’ve
worked very hard to achieve a solid noise floor from within the confines
of the studio, and now you step out into the wide expanse of the real
world with all its air traffic, chirping birds, enthusiastic audiences, and
general noisy ambience. How do you quell that, or should you even try?
Is it possible to take your show on the road and produce the same audio
quality as your home studio? Well, just as Batman has various options
and remote locations of his own Bat Cave, you as a podcaster have
choices for taking your sanctuary of sound to the sidewalk.
(Geeky? Us? Why would you say that?)
Portable Podcasting: The Good, 
the Bad, and the Ugly
Any time you step out of the controlled environment of a studio, there is
the unknown element to consider. Sometimes the unknown element can
add an entirely new and welcomed dimension to your podcast. Other
times this element can work against your episode and either slow its
pace or completely unhinge it, sending you and your show out of control.

However, an opportunity presented isn’t always a
good one if you find yourself unprepared or lacking
direction. 
Before grabbing a moment to gab, consider what
you want to talk about and (this is a harsh truth
you’ll have to deal with) what to do if the recording
or the interview doesn’t go quite the way you hope.
True, the audio you get will be superior to a Skype
or telephone recording; but we’re talking about a
trade-off between convenience and opportunity 
versus preparation and environment. Depending on
how quickly you set up the recording rig or audio
device, you may not be able to scout out a quiet
place fast enough to minimize ambient noise.
Finding the right setting
A very cool thing about podcasting remotely is the
lively and fun settings you can use — a bookstore,
for example. In 2006, New Zealand author Philippa
Ballantine allowed Tee to arrange bookstore sign-
ings for the two of them. They hopped between
Baltimore, Maryland, and Harrisonburg, Viriginia, in
a matter of four days — podcasting every step of the
trip. In their visit to a Harrisonburg bookstore, as
shown in Figure 16-2, the microphones were live,
and the audience asked questions ranging from 
their writing processes to a Kiwi’s perspective on
Americans. It made for some fun and informative
podcasting.
• Figure 16-2: Authors Philippa Ballantine and Tee Morris,
podcasting an evening at Barnes & Noble,
Harrisonburg.
You have a lot of issues to consider when you’re
recording live (or what may be better described
as recording remotely); live recordings are usually
posted later in the same week or month.
Seizing the podcasting opportunity
Whenever you’re on the road, it’s hard to fathom
who or what you will encounter beforehand — an
impromptu musical performance by another pod-
caster, or a representative of a group, corporation,
or perhaps a trade-show vendor that is of keen inter-
est to you and your podcast (as shown in Figure
16-1). This moment could be a serendipitous oppor-
tunity that may not repeat itself anytime soon. On
such an occasion, you have two options: 

Exchange contact information, go home, and try
to figure out the best time to schedule a sit-down
and record either over the phone or through
Skype.

Ask this individual or group what their schedule
is, lock down a time, and record. The sooner you
can do it, the better.
• Figure 16-1: At the Podcast and New Media Expo 2006,
Tee secured an interview with PR Web’s
Andrew Schlicktling shortly after meeting
him on the expo floor.
You never know when your paths will cross again in
something like the situation you currently find your-
self in; having a recording device or rig on hand can
provide a fantastic opportunity for your podcast.

With interaction and reaction from the audience,
the setting of this Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy
(www.teemorris.com/blog) episode took on a
more personal, less-sterile atmosphere. The audi-
ence took part in a virtual question-and-answer ses-
sion with Pip Ballantine — an opportunity hard to
come by because her trips to the United States are
limited.
Sometimes a lively setting can get a bit too crazy.
For the same podcast, Tee attempted to interview
Hugo and Nebula Award winner Robert J. Sawyer at
a science-fiction convention. The first attempted
recording location — a corridor in the host hotel —
erupted suddenly into activity, effectively drowning
out the interview. Moving to a hotel room provided
a less-frantic location for the interview, sacrificing
some on-location ambiance for clarity.
The hotel-room solution was an easy fix for the set-
ting, but other such fixes may not always be so easy.
If you’re recording an interview with a celebrity or
authority in your podcast’s focus, an offer to “hold
the interview in my hotel room” could easily be mis-
construed. If a public setting seems less productive
for an interview, offer to have your interview subject
and his or her assistant(s) join you for the interview,
if that would be more convenient. If this is not an
option, lock down a time later in the day — and then
take a moment to scout around for a quiet area.
(These spots are out there in convention and confer-
ence settings; you may just have to ferret them out.)
Keep a professional attitude and always seek out an
amicable solution.
The trade-off between recording in studio
and recording remotely
The three types of portable rigs discussed in the next
section enable you to expand their built-in recording
capabilities. From the iRiver to the Zoom H4, the
portable digital recorder can do much more than the
simple handheld microcassette recorder that many
people still consider the norm for portable recording.
The technology of built-in microphones has also
greatly improved with time, providing better record-
ing and pickup capabilities than ever before.
A drawback in portability is the consistency of those
built-in microphones, pickups, and (if applicable)
pre-amps. One recorder (say, an Olympus digital)
may yield fantastic results in one setting, but chang-
ing that remote setting to someplace else may pro-
duce audio that’s harder to engineer up to your
normal audio standards. The inconsistency could be
the result of anything from freak weather to weak
batteries. There’s also a certain built-in risk factor:
Most of these portable recorders can’t monitor
incoming audio, so the quality of what you get is
usually evident only after the recording session.
One way of improving the quality of the built-in
microphone is to employ an accessory such as an
external mic — but the more accessories you plug
into your handheld, the less portable you become.
So if you want better audio quality, you begin with
a tradeoff: How much mobility do you sacrifice in
your mobile podcasting rig?
Taking Your Show on the Road
You have various ways to take your podcast mobile.
Some podcasters like to travel with a gig bag that
can hold cables, a mixer board, headphones, and
maybe the kitchen sink. At one time that was as
portable as recording rigs got, but with the popular-
ity of podcasting and advancements in digital
recording technology, the new portable is now
more portable than you might think.
iRiver: The podcaster’s necktie
If you have ever attended a podcasters’ convention
(or are sitting in on the podcasting track of a science
fiction convention), you might notice a few of the
panelists and other participants wearing things
around their necks that look like bulkier versions of
the first-generation iPod Shuffles. They may come in
a variety of colors, and at the right time, you might
even see some of the podcasters talking into them.
These devices from iRiver (http://iriver
america.com) are known as the Ultra-Portable
iRiver Players.

Practice 16: Podcasting from the Road

Pictured in Figure 16-3 is the 800 series, the iRiver
that remains a popular model with podcasters
because of extremely reliable built-in mics (with fan-
tastic pickups), available mic jacks for external
microphones, and stereo mp3 recording (with bit
rates up to 320 kbps and sampling rates up to 44.1
kHz). iRivers also come in a variety of sizes (256MB,
512MB, and 1GB) and can record hours of audio,
powered by a single AA battery. Weighing no more
than a set of car keys, this accessory remains vital
to any podcaster because the iRiver 800 (and even
the older models) can interface seamlessly with
both Mac and Windows platforms. Later versions
of the iRiver (from the T-series) support only
Windows XP, shutting out many other podcasters.
Another problem with the iRiver is its interface,
which its users hardly describe as intuitive. 
These iRivers, while not available at your local
Best Buy and Circuit City stores, are readily
available online at eBay and other online ven-
dors. (Simply do a search for iRiver Portable
players and hit results should pop up.)
• Figure 16-3: The iRiver Ultra-Portable 800 series mp3

A squid even Captain Nemo could love
The iRiver 800-series Ultra-Portables could brag with confi-
dence that their built-in microphones were (and still are)
very good microphones, considering their size and con-
struction. However, in interview situations (and some sound-
seeing tour settings), the built-in microphone’s limitations
show up right away. From overmodulation to sudden drop
outs, the iRiver microphone can be a bit unpredictable from
situation to situation. 
However, with the 800-series comes a Line In jack that
gives users the opportunity (provided they can navigate
through the user-unfriendly interface) to plug in other audio-
input devices. And from Giant Squid Labs (www.giant-
squid-audio-lab.com/) comes an economic and
reliable alternative to the iRiver’s built-in mic: the Podcasting
Omni Stereo Microphone (shown below). Tethered to a 
5-foot cable, its two dime-size lavalier mics provide some
nice specs for podcasters:

these mics. Durable. Affordable. If you have an iRiver (or
any digital recorder for that matter) with a Line In option,
then give Giant Squid Lab’s Podcasting Omni a look. It
may be one of the most versatile and reliable accessories in
your portable podcasting arsenal.

The M-Audio MobilePre: Your recording 
studio as carry-on luggage
The iRivers are excellent portable devices, providing
you with quick podcasting solutions, but even their
built-in microphones have limitations. You want a
studio-quality sound, but you would also like to take
your setup on the road as needed. M-Audio (online
at www.m-audio.com) offers an option that answers
the call: the USB MobilePre (shown in Figure 16-4).
• Figure 16-4: The M-Audio MobilePre USB preamp.
This compact recording solution, priced at around
$150 USD, fits in the palm of your hand and is com-
pletely USB-powered. After its drivers are installed,
setup is a snap:
1.
Plug your MobilePre’s USB cable into your
computer’s USB port. 
Install the drivers for your MobilePre USB
in your computer first. Drivers are available
for both Mac and Windows platforms at
www.m-audio.com/index.php?do=
support.drivers under the option of
USB Audio Series.
As you’re working with audio, we recommend
plugging into a USB port directly, not through
a USB hub. While the M-Audio component
will probably work, there may be a loss of
recording quality or data transfer issues when
working through a hub.
2.
Plug in your microphones’ XLR or 1/8-inch
connectors.
The MobilePre USB has several Line inputs, but
the preamps there are built for instruments, not
microphones and vocals. Any signal you get if
you use the line inputs will be weak at best.
3.
Press the button labeled Phantom Power to
supply power for your XLR microphones.
4.
Launch your audio-editing software.
Your MobilePre has to be up and running before
you launch your digital audio workstation
(DAW). Otherwise, the software won’t see the
device, or you may get a software or system
crash. (For more on the various DAWs out there,
see Practice 11.)
5.
Set your levels by adjusting either the Channel
1 or Channel 2 knobs.
Keep an eye on the lights to the right of each
knob. The signal light is telling you that the
MobilePre is receiving an audio signal, which is
always a good thing. The blinking red light labeled
clip is an indication that your incoming signal is
too loud — the nuances of your sound are being
cut off (clipped) by the MobilePre to keep the
overmodulation under some kind of control.
6.
Record your podcast, adjusting Channel 1 or 2
as you see fit.
The third knob on the MobilePre is for your
headphone volume. Adjusting this setting
won’t affect your input signal, but make sure
that you’re adjusting either the volume of your
headphones or increasing the signal coming
into your DAW. Don’t lose track of what you’re
adjusting. If your headphones are all the way
up, you might need to adjust your channels. If
you are noticing a lot of clipping, check your
headphone volume; the signal may be blasting
in at a higher level than you know. And try to
keep both the input level and the headphone
volume down to a comfortable level. Your ears
are easier to damage than you might think.

The designers made this gizmo look like something
Jack Bauer would use on 24 when interrogating bad
guys. It’s not a Tazer. It’s not a tricorder from Star
Trek. It’s not a dimensional rift-maker from Sliders,
either. It’s the Zoom H4, a new all-in-one, portable
recording device designed for podcasters, audio
professionals, and recording enthusiasts (see 
Figure 16-5).
• Figure 16-5: Samson’s Zoom H4.
At around $300 USD, the Zoom H4 rests comfortably
in the palm of your hand, but comes with an optional
tray and two Velcro straps that secure the device
and allow mounting on an optional tripod for live
settings and musical performances. The Zoom also
comes with a windscreen designed for the two stereo
mics built into the top of the unit, a free 128MB flash
card (where your audio is stored), a USB cable to
make the transfer of audio simple, a handy carrying
bag, and finally, a copy of Cubase in case you don’t
have Soundtrack Pro or Audition handy.
The MobilePre, along with being extremely mobile,
is extremely versatile for podcasting purposes, offer-
ing to your rig these extra bonuses:

Hookup for third mic: The MobilePre not only
allows for two XLR mics, but also has a Stereo
Mic jack in the back all set up and ready for
a third microphone. For a two-person podcast,
the third mic can provide a terrific opportunity
for live audiences to interact with you and your
co-host or interview subject. The third mic can
also open up your show for more participants.
If your podcast features music, you can take
advantage of the MobilePre’s instrument line
inputs.
The more stuff you plug into the MobilePre,
the more you are splitting the incoming audio
signals. You may need to readjust the levels to
keep volume levels of the podcast audible and
constant.

Top-notch sound quality for portable device:
Another terrific advantage of the MobilePre is
that it provides you with as close-to-studio-
quality sound as you’ll find with portable record-
ing devices. If you’re a podcasting newcomer,
the MobilePre is an excellent, inexpensive way
to give podcasting a try without having to invest
in heavy-duty equipment.
M-Audio offers other portable solutions similar to
the MobilePre USB, but for the expandability you get
for the investment, the MobilePre is hard to beat
and a great way to test the waters. Then if you ever
upgrade your studio, hang on to the unit and use it
for recordings from the road.
The Zoom H4: The best of both worlds
Introduced at the Podcast and Portable Media Expo
in 2006 — and quickly becoming the must-have
accessory for podcasters — Samson (online at
www.samsontech.com) combines the power of the
MobilePre USB and the portability of the iRiver.

Taking Your Show on the Road

Running on two AA batteries, the Zoom can record
in four modes:

Track 1: WAV format at 96 kHz

Track 2: WAV format at 48 kHz

Track 3: WAV format at 44.1 kHz

Track 4: mp3 format at 44.1 kHz
Recording
When you load up the Zoom with batteries and the
flash storage (128MB gains you roughly two hours of
recording time when you’re recording directly to the
mp3 format), the interface may be a little intimidat-
ing at first, but it’s easy to navigate one you get past
the learning curve. 
To make your first recording on the Zoom:
1.
Turn the Zoom H4 on by flipping the ON/OFF
switch located on the left side of the unit. 
2.
Select your mode of recording.
For this example, let’s work with recording
directly to mp3. Press the 4 button on the left
side of the screen. It lights up green, and the
screen gives you a summary of what mode
you’re recording in. 
3.
Press the Rec button on the right-hand side
once. 
The Rec light blinks until you press the button
again. Figure 16-6 shows what you see on-screen.
• Figure 16-6: When you press the Record button, you see
your Zoom picking up sound — but you are
NOT recording yet.

Pressing the record button once does not
mean you are recording. Unlike the iRiver,
pressing the Rec button puts you into a Level
Test mode. Only on the second pressing of the
Record button do you start recording audio.
4.
Press the Menu button located underneath
the readout. From the options offered in the
Zoom’s interface window, select File by using
the small wheel on the right-hand side of the
device. (This will move the cursor up or down.)
When you have the cursor next to File, push
the wheel to select that option.
In the top-right corner of the interface window,
the REC indicator is set to pause even though
you see the sound in a range that registers on
the Zoom’s VU meter.
5.
Set your levels by adjusting the placement of
the Zoom in the vicinity of your recording
subject.
6.
Record your podcast by pushing the blinking
Record button a second time. 
The button is now a solid red, indicating that the
device is recording sound.
7.
To stop recording, press the solid red Record
button. 
The Zoom stops recording and the red light
turns off.
Transferring recordings to your computer
When you’ve bagged that recorded sound for your
podcast, follow these steps to get the sound off
the Zoom H4 and into your computer for editing
purposes:
1.
Located next to the ON/OFF switch is a USB
input port. Plug in your USB cord there.
Turn off the H4 Zoom before plugging the
USB cable into the unit and the computer.

expandability that the M-Audio MobilePre offers,
only now you have everything — microphones,
recording software, preamps, pickups, the works —
in one device. Copy the files from the Zoom to
your computer (much the way you would with the
iRiver), and you’re all set to go.
Exploring the Zoom
The Zoom has many, many other features and capabilities,
but you may have to do some experimenting to find out
everything this incredible piece of audio technology can
do. So, for other functions (such as activating phantom
power, utilizing the Zoom’s compressor/limiter, and using
the multitrack recording capabilities), keep the operations
manual close at hand. Some afternoon or evening, you
may be playing with the higher functions, only to discover
that one function that unlocks the full potential of this fan-
tastic recorder. (Hey, it beats watching reruns, and it helps
your podcast. What’s not to like?)
While a heftier investment than a MobilePre or the
iRiver iFP model, the Zoom does offer a lot of possi-
bilities for the podcaster, and its cousin the Zoom
H2 also promises to be a terrific portable option for
your audio.
When you’ve chosen your remote-recording option
and spent some time getting to know it, it’s time to
take the show on the road!

edited) out. When you have the microphones out
and nestled in their respective shock mounts, curi-
ous individuals will wonder what’s going on. If
you’re in a festive setting where bystanders are
enjoying a drink or two, often people will summon
up the courage to come on mic (or on pod, as some
people are now coining the phrase) and ask, “What
are you all doing over here?” 
Not all mics are created equal; it’s a good
idea to have the right mics for on-the-road-
podcasting. To find out more about what
mics are best for you and your podcasting
demands, jump back to Practice 10 for all the
details and a few solid recommendations. 
It’s a real challenge to maintain a focus with so
much outside stimulation, and it can be a real testa-
ment to the engaging nature of your content. Can
you keep your focus, or is it easy to just let the
coherence of your podcast fall by the wayside and
let the environment distract you?
When you’re recording remotely, keep the following
points in mind: 

Make sure that recording in a live setting is
right for your show. Does the podcast really
need this extra element? If you are doing it prima-
rily for crowd reaction, then run with the envi-
ronment and don’t worry about the challenge
acoustics are going to pose. In fact, enjoy the hol-
low, echoing sound a live setting gives your voice
because it adds to that live sound all the more.
That said, the live setting of your recording
should have a purpose behind it. Otherwise your
podcast is taken out of its element for no real
reason other than to say, “Hey, we’re live!” Have
an answer in mind for this question of purpose.

Plan out your live show. It is always a good idea
to have a plan for your episode, be it a full-out
script or an outline. Having a game plan before a
live recording is paramount, though. We’ve seen
experienced podcasters try to fly by the seat of
their pants while putting together a live record-
ing. Sometimes the spontaneity works. Other
times, it’s a painful and laborious ride. 
The best approach to mobile podcasting is
to have an idea — a direction — for the live
recording. Keep in mind that when you’re in
a live setting with unknown elements in the
mix, your plan may become more like a
guideline; allow the direction of the episode
some wiggle room so it can change course a
bit if necessary.

React and comment on distractions. The sec-
ond-worst thing we’ve seen podcast hosts do in
live settings is pretend that nothing is happening
in front of their recording session. If the setting
is (say) Dragon*Con, with costumes galore pass-
ing by, this is a tragedy — those individuals are
interviews (and instant content) waiting to hap-
pen. Or if the Elvis Chicken is walking by at the
Podcast and New Media Expo, why not comment
on it? It’s hard to miss it.
The worst thing we’ve seen at a live recording is
when another host or guest comments on a dis-
traction, only to have the host completely blow
off the comment with, “Don’t pay any attention
to that. We were talking about. . . . “ The activity
around you is fantastic fodder for your podcast.
Let the setting carry your conversation or inter-
view onto interesting tangents. Tying them back
into the main theme may challenge your creativ-
ity, but it is a credit to your podcasting skills
when you do pull that off.

Don’t let the distractions dictate your podcast.
This may seem contradictory, but always keep it
in the forefront of your mind: While the live set-
ting can provide a lot of fun topics for your
episode to explore, the podcast should still keep
a sense of focus about itself. If you rely on dis-
tractions to provide your episode with content,
or if your engaging discussion suddenly diverts
into talking about a particular car that just drove
by the window, you run the risk of losing the
focus and intent of your podcast. Invite some
stimulus from the outside world, but never lose
sight of your podcast’s goals. Figure 16-8 shows
Tee making the most of a live setting.

Practice 16: Podcasting from the Road

There are good reasons to podcast from live settings,
but do your best never to shy away from what the
live setting throws at you. Otherwise why leave the
comfort zone of your studio? Embrace the space
around you and your mobile recording rig; enjoy this
new and exciting avenue of podcasting. The more fun
you have in your outdoor, away-from-studio environ-
ment, the more your audience will feel as if they’re
right there, enjoying the afternoon with you.

Interviews from
the Road
W
orking remotely has its advantages and disadvantages over
working in a studio. Although something can be said for the
ambiance of passers-by and sounds of activity around you while
you record a podcast on the road, you can also make a strong case for
having the control over your surroundings that a studio offers: You know
how your studio sounds, you keep the undesired noise to a minimum,
and you can set up the best kind of background (a quiet one) for record-
ing your content.
In some situations, though, you have no choice but to record remotely —
and that’s often true of interview settings. If you incorporate guests into
your podcast’s format, you may not always be able to do interviews in
your home or studio. You may need to conduct phone-in interviews,
make use of online communication options like Skype, or work with
a portable rig (more about that in Practice 16) — none of which is
necessarily a bad thing; it’s often good interview etiquette to bring your
recording equipment to your interview subjects rather than make them
come to you. In this practice, we cover the ins and outs of taking the
show (in this case, the interview) on the road.
Introducing a “Live on Location” Interview
Say you have your laptop equipment or your portable digital recorder set
up and ready to go. When you’re recording interviews from the road, you
can either launch into your interview or regard your guest as part of that
particular episode show. Find out what the subject’s schedule allows for
and then record accordingly.
While you’re pondering which approach is likely to work best, think
about how guests are worked into the shows Late Night with David
Letterman and The Tonight Show. At the opening of the show, Dave does
his monologue and the goofy segments such as the Top Ten List or

“And welcome back to (your podcast name).
I am your chief drill instructor, (your name),
here with (your guest’s name).” By opening
your interview with this kind of introduction,
you now have set up the interview as a segment
of your show. You open with your show’s intro-
duction banter, perhaps a news segment or
what’s going on around the studio, and then
you transition into a break by saying, “When we
return, an interview with. . . .” You then play pro-
mos and return immediately with your interview.
All three of these interview introductions are inten-
tionally brief. You don’t want to keep your guests
waiting. You want to give them as much time on-mic
as you can. Many guests, whether they’re recording
on location or even phoning in for an interview,
have allocated a specific period of time for your
interview. So before you begin recording, ask your
guests how much time they have. Your intro should
take up as little time as possible, giving you more
time for questions and answers. Your time with
guests is very valuable — make it count!
Recording the segue to the introduction
If you’ve decided that the sit-down with your guest is
going to be a show segment, you should still record a
brief transition, or segue, from the flow of podcast
banter into the interview. The segue brings you and
your listeners into the discussion and can even pro-
vide a bit of background for why this guest is appear-
ing on your show. For example, you can say right
before your first break spot, “When we return, an
interview with. . . ,” or “Coming up next, an interview
with. . . .” These are examples of segues.
With your segue, follow these tips in putting it
together:

Let your listeners know what’s coming up.
Interviews may not be the norm for your show,
and if this guest is particularly special, the segue
is a good opportunity to let your subscribers
know what’s coming up in this episode or (say)
after the next break. An introduction like this is
just a friendly heads-up.
what’s on the menu at local delis. For Jay, it’s
roughly the same thing: opening monologue fol-
lowed by segments like “Jaywalking” or offbeat clas-
sified ads.
What both formats have in common are that the
guests are not present initially.
Unless the guests become an active part of these
segments, they are usually being prepped for their
appearance in the Green Room, or on the way to the
studio while the opening skits are going on. The
skits are treated as independent spots, distinct from
the sit-down interviews. Therefore, after these seg-
ments occur, the host usually creates a bumper that
leads to a commercial, saying (for instance), “When
we get back, an interview with so-and-so.”
Generally, it’s bad form to keep guests waiting or sit-
ting next to you saying nothing while you do the
opening banter for your podcast (or hit the news
and interesting sidebar tidbits) before getting
around to the interview. Instead, treat the interview
as an independent segment. Unless the guest is a
part of the introduction banter, news segments, or
other content, conduct the interview first; you can
record the other segments later.
Recording your interview’s intro
After you’re all set up for the interview, record an
introduction that brings you into the discussion
with your guest. Here are a few examples:

“And welcome to another episode of (your
podcast). I am your chief drill instructor, (your
name), and I am here with (your guest’s
name).” This sort of introduction launches your
show right into the interview — no introduction
banter and no opening news segments.

“We are recording live from (your location),
and I am here with (your guest’s name).” This
approach gives you a little versatility. You can
have an opening show segment bring you into an
interview, or you can record a brief introduction
that segues into the interview.


Provide some background on your guest. Never
assume that everyone listening knows your
guest — not even if the guest is someone often
seen in the media spotlight. Fill in some of your
guest’s background, the company or organiza-
tion he or she represents (if that’s relevant),
and what brings this person to your podcast.
Keeping your audience in the know is a nice
touch.

Keep the introduction brief. Once again, there’s
that B-word. You want to build up expectations
in your segue, not paraphrase the interview that
is coming up. Keep your segue under five min-
utes (two to three minutes is best). Keep the
facts quick, concise, and clear. Then you go into
the interview and let the discussion speak
for itself.
Working with VoIP: The Voice
of a New Generation
You will likely hear the term VoIP quite a bit from
podcasters when they talk about recording inter-
views from various locations. VoIP stands for Voice
over Internet Protocol, but it’s also called IP telephony
or Internet telephony. VoIP is a combination of soft-
ware and hardware that makes audio conversations
happen over the Internet. 
So why is VoIP so important in remote recording?
Podcasters can take advantage of the ease and
accessibility of VoIP in a variety of ways, but the 
two main reasons are audio quality and cost. Many
conference-call services offer a free option for you
to set up hard-line-based conversations, but if you
want to record those meetings, you have to pay a
steep fee. Additionally, the call itself is coming in
at a mere 8 kHz quality — and that’s if the quality of
the phone service is top notch. With mobile phones
becoming the primary phones (both at home and on
the road) for many people, the connection you get
can be somewhat dodgy. 
Dodgy phone service is enough for you to consider
a VoIP solution. But many VoIP solutions (described
next) offer recording capabilities ranging from free
to under $20 USD for a one-time purchase of the
software. With a dramatic boost in the audio quality
of VoIP (32 kHz or better), the cost-effectiveness of
the recording software, and the ability to hold con-
versations in any Wi-Fi hot spot, VoIP is an essential
tool for interviewers.
Using Skype
Skype (www.skype.com) is the most popular VoIP
solution for recording conversations and interviews.
The application is safe, offered as a free download,
and is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux plat-
forms. The audio quality of Skype improves if the
application is running through an audio card differ-
ent from the one preinstalled in your computer.
(Many of the manufacturer’s internal sound cards
handle the basics, but audio cards from vendors like
M-Audio may offer more power for the audio signal,
allowing for better reception.) You can use the com-
puter’s existing audio card, but your performance
may vary.
For the best audio quality, you want to use Skype-to-
Skype connections, where all parties involved in the
recorded discussion are using Skype.
Before you can use Skype, you need to download
and install the software from www.skype.com and
create a Skype account. After Skype is up and run-
ning, follow these steps to add contacts:
1.
In the main Contacts window, click the plus
sign in the lower-left corner; or choose
Contacts➪Add a Contact. 
The Add a Skype Contact dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 17-1.
2.
In the top field, enter a Skype Name (the
account nickname you created when register-
ing with Skype), a legal name, or an e-mail
address of the individual you want to add to
your contacts. Then click the Search button.
Search results appear below the search field.

Practice 17: Interviews from the Road

3.
Click and drag the desired Skype IDs from
the Contact window into the active Skype call
window.
The names then appear in the active Skype call
window, and your conference is underway.
• Figure 17-2: Depending on how you have set up your
Skype Preferences, double-clicking a contact
either produces an instant message interface
(top) or automatically makes a Skype call to
that contact (bottom).
• Figure 17-1: To begin building your list of contacts, simply
let your fingers do the walking through the
Skype directory.
3.
Click the desired name in the Search Results
and then click Add Contact in the lower-right
corner of the dialog box. 
If you are asked to request authorization, per-
sonalize the message offered and click OK. 
Now with approved contacts in your Skype contacts,
you can begin making Skype-to-Skype calls. To make
a VoIP call using Skype, simply click the name of the
Skype user to expand the user details and then click
the green phone icon to make a call. You then see
one of the two windows shown in Figure 17-2.
It’s just that simple to call someone on Skype. You
can also double-click the contact in your Skype win-
dow to make a call, or if your Preferences pull up the
Instant Message interface, click the green phone
icon. That’s it! 
But what if you are hosting several individuals in this
interview? Skype can handle conference calls as well: 
1.
Contact your first interview subject in your
Skype contact window by placing the call. 
2.
After the call is established, find the other par-
ties involved in this interview or discussion on
your Skype contacts.

Working with VoIP: The Voice of a New Generation

Unlike text chats on Skype, the only person
who can add people to a Skype VoIP confer-
ence call is the person who initiated the call.
Using SkypeOut
SkypeOut is just one of Skype’s many features. While
Skype-to-Skype conversations are far from the norm,
you can take advantage of SkypeOut for those
guests who are still not certain about using VoIP on
their own computers. With SkypeOut, you can make
telephone calls to users anywhere in the world, to
any telephone in the world. For the people who
aren’t on Skype, SkypeOut is your option. 
At the time of this writing, here’s what the SkypeOut
nationwide plan offers:

12 months of unlimited calls to any phone within
the U.S. and Canada

No connection fees charged for calls to U.S. or
Canadian phones

Only $29.95 for 12 months, or $8.85 for 3 months
Here’s how the SkypeOut international plan
currently works:

2.1¢ per minute to more than 30 global
destinations

Rates based on destination country

Connection fee of 3.9¢ charged for each call

Buy Skype Credit to pay per-minute. The credits
are deducted as you make your SkypeOut calls.
Skype users can buy time (credits) to make calls to
hard lines from coast-to-coast or around the world.
After you have your credit in place, place your call
through Skype:
1.
In the main Skype window, click the telephone
icon in the lower-left corner.
The icon is labeled with the words Call Phones
or Send SMS.
2.
From the Select Country or Region drop-down
menu, shown in Figure 17-3, select the country
you want to call.
3.
With your country zone selected, enter the
phone number and make the call.
With Skype, you’ve sidestepped the need for compli-
cated (and expensive) phone patches that might not
yield the same quality as a Skype call. You can now
have calls, both Skype-to-Skype and Skype-to-Phone,
running digitally through your computer. 
All that remains is recording your calls, as described
in the next section.

hardly anything to give you pause. For a mere $15,

Call Recorder
ECamm’s Call Recorder for the Mac OS (www.ecamm.
com/mac/callrecorder/) is the recording solution
for both Skype audio and video, capturing your
conversations and allowing you to turn them into
podcasts. 
Features of Call Recorder, shown in Figure 17-5,
include

Manual start, stop, and pause

Preferences that allow you to auto-record all calls

Control over file size, quality, and compression
to mp3, H.264, or AAC file formats
• Figure 17-5: Mac users can easily incorporate Call
Recorder with Skype.
Priced at $16 USD at the time of this writing, Call
Recorder has established itself as a Mac podcaster’s
essential asset when recording interviews via Skype.
Audio and video can be captured either uncom-
pressed or already compressed and ready for posting.
Many audio recorders have preset compres-
sion settings for formats like mp3 and AAC,
giving you little if any control over how the
audio or video is compressed. Provided you
have the disk space, capture the video or
audio in its raw, uncompressed format and
then compress it with the application of your
choice. By compressing the media from a raw
format, not a compressed one, you have more
versatility with the media and are less likely to
overcompress your interview.
Using Skype and third-party recorders
When recording interviews with your guests while
on the road, you could try to bring with you hard-
ware that “plugs” into your friend’s telephone or
utilizes the hotel’s telephone . . . and pay for it later
when it’s time to settle the bill. The complicated
solution is not always the best one, so why not
invest in a simple one-button recorder installed into
your laptop for your needs? Mac and Windows both
have these third-party solutions that perform
admirably and do not break the bank. In the next
sections, we talk about two: HotRecorder (Windows)
and Call Recorder (Mac).
HotRecorder
HotRecorder (http://hotrecorder.com) allows you
to record conversations running through Skype along
with other applications like AOL Instant Messenger
and Google Talk. HotRecorder (shown in Figure 17-4)
can record and export your Skype chats by recording
all connected parties through two separate channels,
merging them into a single file at the end.
• Figure 17-4: HotRecorder is the cost-effective solution for
recording Skype chats using Windows.

caster, an inexpensive option for bringing guests
from all parts of the world into your studio. 
Improving Sound Quality 
on the Road
With portable recording rigs like the M-Audio
MobilePre and Samson’s H2 and H4 Zoom, you can
take your act on tour. Two microphones, a portable
recorder, and mic stands can now all fit into an over-
the-shoulder gig bag, turning the world (and wher-
ever you happen to stop) into your own personal
recording studio.
However, as we’ve discussed in other practices,
ambient noise may provide a challenge when you’re
recording on the road. Ambient noise should not be
confused with white noise; often these two terms
are used interchangeably when they shouldn’t be. 
Ambient noise is background noise that comes from
the immediate surroundings, used to create or
enhance a mood or atmosphere. If (say) you’re
recording a podcast with a friend in the park, then
the sounds of traffic, people passing by, dogs bark-
ing, and birds chirping are considered ambient
noise; they set an atmosphere or mood. 
White noise is a wash of noise, pure and simple.
White noise contains many frequencies (as ambient
noise can), but these frequencies are all heard at
equal intensities. Static is most commonly identified
as white noise, but a crowd at a rock concert, the
sound of a train passing by, or traffic on the tarmac
of an airport can constitute white noise.
When recording interviews remotely, take a look at
where you want to record and run down a checklist
of variables:

Does the ambiance remain in the background,
or overpower the interview? Where you decide
to record directly affects the interview, both in
its flow and in its recording quality. You want the
atmosphere to add something to the interview,
not detract from the message or intent of the
interview (or the episode) itself.

Regardless of the ambiance, does the setting of
your remote interview remain conducive to
your interview? High-traffic areas, though they
provide terrific backdrops for your interviews,
may prove counterproductive when you’re
recording. Too much traffic, too many simulta-
neous conversations, and occasional interrup-
tions can disrupt the pace of your interview or
drown out the interview subject altogether.
Larger rooms — even if they’re quiet — can pro-
vide challenges because sound travels differently
within their cavernous confines. Get a sense for
how you sound in the room of choice; from there,
you can decide how you will proceed.

What kind of microphones are you using?
Dynamic microphones are best for field record-
ings, but they vary in quality from manufacturer
to manufacturer — and can demand a lot from the
interview subject (for example, speaking louder
than normal). Condenser microphones are opti-
mal for studio use but should not be used out in
the field. Due to their sensitivity, condenser mics
pick up far more sound from the background.
So you have found a good place to record, but now
you’re looking for balanced audio levels between
you, your interview subject, and your background.
The solutions happen either during recording or in
post-production. The following sections explore
your options.
Riding the board
Keeping your audio at levels that make everyone
happy — and (more importantly) keep everyone
sounding professional — means getting a good bal-
ance from both (or all) voices involved. As you and
your interview subject (or your podcasting crew)
gather in a central location, you or one of your crew
members can focus attention on the mixer or pre-
amp and ride the board — adjust channel settings
during the recording session. When a voice suddenly
picks up in volume, the levels are adjusted to com-
pensate, and then readjusted to the original setting
when the voice returns to its original decibel level.

Practice 17: Interviews from the Road

The Levelator has been called everything from
efficient to magic in how it works (and it doesn’t hurt
that it’s free). Designed specifically for recording set-
tings such as interviews and panel discussions,
Levelator balances all sounds in a single audio file,
boosting fainter frequencies and clipping louder fre-
quencies when needed.
The Levelator is better as a “post-treatment” than as
a “post-production” tool. After your session is con-
cluded, go on and run your audio through Levelator.
When doing so, be sure you:

Save your Levelator-treated audio under a
different filename. By having the original audio
to go back to, you haven’t lost the interview if
Levelator turns out to be the wrong answer.

Review your Levelator-treated audio after
you’re done. As mentioned in this book repeat-
edly, you should always review your podcast
before posting it. Take a listen to the Levelator’s
treatment of your audio to find out what it has
done to the audio.

Mix in bed music, sound effects, and opening
and closing themes after using the Levelator.
Now that the Levelator has evened the audio
playing field, take this audio and give it a solid
post-production treatment.
Although it’s a quick and easy solution, the
Levelator is (of course) neither magic nor arti-
ficial intelligence and therefore does not dis-
criminate on audio signals. It looks at all the
incoming signals and attempts to boost or
reduce all audio levels in order to maintain
the same level; all noise, including bed music
and background ambiance, is balanced to
peak at the same level. The end result resem-
bles less of a podcast and something more
like a medley of competing audio. When
using Levelator, make sure subtleties (such as
fade-outs, bed music, and so on) are added in
after Levelator is applied to the audio. 
Riding the board may sound easy to do, but if you
are the interviewer, your attention is divided
between your subject and your levels. You want to
focus on the reactions of your subject to gauge the
pace of the interview. Are you and the subject mak-
ing a good connection or creating chemistry? Is the
subject comfortable with the line of questioning and
the direction of the discussion? Is the level of inter-
est with the interview subject still there? This kind of
consistency is difficult to achieve when your atten-
tion hops between the subject and your mixer or
pre-amp levels. So here’s another relevant question:
Are your multitasking skills fluent enough to chance
jeopardizing the quality of your on-site interview?
Handling audio levels during the recording session
does give you an advantage in that you spend less
time in post-editing and production. Also, riding the
board (provided you’re comfortable with managing
levels in real time) can give you a better-quality
recording that’s easier to edit in post-production. 
Using Levelator
The Conversations Network has developed a quick
post-production solution for making your interview
subject and yourself match aurally: the Levelator
(www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator),
shown in Figure 17-6. This free download is a popu-
lar audio solution for podcasters, and no wonder:
Podcasters developed it, and it is available for Mac,
Windows, and Linux. The Levelator adjusts audio
levels within a recording session, offering the most
sought-after qualities of a compressor/limiter.

Wrapping Up Your Interview
135
Inserting Breaks into
an Interview
When an interview is taking place, often such
niceties as show format, spot breaks, and IDs are
forgotten — especially when the interview hits its
stride and the chemistry between show host and
subject is evident.
This means that you insert your breaks in post-
production. Where are some good places to work in
spot breaks? Here are some ideas:

Halfway through the interview. During your
interview, you should always be aware of the
time. When your interview is done, look at its
running time and simply place your break at or
near the halfway point. You can fade out during a
question and then fade up before the break point
in order to hear the initial question — or break
before your next halfway-point question
is asked.

Brief pauses within your interview. Many inter-
views or discussions have natural breaks in their
flow, where you’re reviewing your questions or
the interview subject is thinking about the next
answer. These natural pauses in the flow of dis-
cussion, provided they land in the right places,
can provide equally nice places for podcast IDs,
spot breaks, or quick announcements that are
independent of the interview.

Break the interview across two (or more)
shows. Depending on the running time of your
show and the recorded interview, you can sim-
ply make the interview a single segment of your
show and then break the interview to cover mul-
tiple shows. This method can keep the format of
your show intact. You can also get several shows
out of one good interview.
Wrapping Up Your Interview
If the answers start to slow down or the pace of the
interview is not as rapid-fire as in the beginning,
take a glance at the time. Whether you’re recording
with hardware like an iRiver or a Zoom, or software
like Soundtrack Pro or Audition, you can keep track
of how long you have been talking with your subject.
The average interview can run 10 to 15 minutes, but
if an interview is moving along on track with terrific
synergy, it’s not unheard-of to record 30 to 40 min-
utes of discussion.
But to quote actor John de Lancie from the finale of
Star Trek: The Next Generation: “It’s been fun . . . but
all good things must come to an end.” 
Especially if you are just kicking back with friends
(like an evening with Fear the Boot in a cigar bar) or
with someone you admire (like a sit-down chat with
fantasy author Terry Brooks), you don’t want to
overstay your welcome. Watch the time spent with
your guest. Regardless of whether things are going
well in your recording session, look to wrap up your
interview efficiently if you happen to pass the 
30-minute mark. Here are some good transitions
to wrap things up:

“And finally, I’d like to ask. . . .” This signals to
your interview subject or to your crew that there
is time for one more comment or tangent to
explore and then you’re bringing the recording
to a close. Give the subject or discussion time to
wrap up after the question is asked. Anywhere
from five to ten minutes (and if the discussion is
lively, ten minutes will go by fast) should be a
good pocket of time to grant to the final question.

“In closing, is there anything you’d like to pro-
mote or talk about. . . .” Most interviews are part
of a promotion and marketing plan, or an “aware-
ness tour” that brings attention to an event or
cause close to the speaker. This opportunity
gives the subject time to plug the event they’re
attending, mention upcoming appearances, or
expound a little more on what’s happening in the
live setting where you’re recording.

“Thanks so much for joining me on (your pod-
cast name).” Before completely closing up your
production, make sure that you thank your guest
for taking time to talk to you. Especially if this
interview is in a live setting where your guest
has made prior commitments, consider that you

may be taking time that he or she set aside for
others. Don’t take that kind of attention for
granted. Give a sincere thank you (and a firm
handshake) to your guest. It’s a really nice way
to end an interview.

Setting Acceptable
Sound Levels
R
ecording studios and broadcast facilities have rack after rack of
equipment, all designed to change, alter, and enhance audio for
presentation to the public. Chances are, you don’t have access to
that kind of equipment — and you might not know what to do with it if
you did. One of the great things about podcasting is that you don’t need
that kind of facility to create a show. All you need is a computer and a
decent microphone that can connect to your computer. The headset
microphone you use for chatting with your video game’s strike team
probably won’t work, but plenty of other low-cost options will.
No matter what equipment you use, however, you need to make sure that
you get the proper volume levels for your recording. Levels that are too
low could allow static and other noise into the recording, and your listen-
ers will be forced to crank their volume knobs in order to hear anything
at all (providing a rude awakening when the normal volume recording up
next blasts them out of the room like a Schwarzenegger stunt). Crank it
up too much, and it’s going to sound distorted no matter what you do to
it later. It’s impossible to fix that kind of a problem during mixing. The
best practice is to record at the right level the first time.
Controlling Volume: All the Gains in Stages
The first step in getting good sound levels is understanding gain-staging.
Between the microphone and the computer can be several levels of
equipment designed to raise the volume, or gain, of the audio signal
going through it. Each stage is capable of hurting or helping the audio as
it goes along; you want to be careful as you move through each stage of
the recording process.
When gain-staging your equipment, the most important step is the first
volume control encountered in the chain. This control has the most
effect on how the signal sounds throughout the process. If the signal is
too low at this point, noise creeps in, and that noise becomes amplified
as the gain-staging continues. If the signal is too high, nothing can
remove the distortion.

of incoming mics — and it demands your attention.
If this volume control is the first you have on your
setup, a good rule in the digital realm is to set that
gain at or below –6 dB to –10 dB. You never want to
let the volume on that first control rise above 
0 dB, because that’s where digital distortion occurs.
Start by speaking into the mic (so that’s why roadies
keep saying, “Check one, check two!”) in a clear and
even tone, like you would use to actually record the
podcast. As you’re talking, adjust the volume to
the proper range.
On the Mac, the volume control (as shown in Fig-
ure 18-1) is found under Applications➪Utilities➪
Audio/MIDI Control. In Windows, you can access the
recording volume control by following these steps:
• Figure 18-1: The volume control for a Blue Snowball
microphone.
1.
Right-click the small speaker icon in the
bottom-right corner of your desktop.
2.
In Windows Vista, click Recording Devices and
select the microphone you want to use.
In Windows XP, click Open Volume Control,
choose Options➪Properties, and click Recording.
The first stage is the distance between you and the
mic, and the volume at which you or another person
speaks into the mic. Make sure that you speak into
the mic from about 3 to 4 inches away, and that you
speak in a clear and precise voice. Watch the levels
on the devices you’re using to record and make sure
that you’re staying around the –6 dB level.
Without getting bogged down in a bunch of
math and no doubt making your head swim,
a decibel (or dB) is a measure of the power of
sound. It’s based on a logarithmic scale; even
though a sound may increase by 10 dB, it
represents only an apparent doubling in the
loudness. Another 10 dB would double that
loudness, though, and so on. Things can get
rather loud rather quickly.
The microphone
Most microphones don’t have volume knobs on
them — that kind of control comes later down the
line. Still, controls are on the device that alter how
the initial sound is recorded. The most common is
an attenuator switch, more commonly known as a
pad switch. This switch automatically reduces the
gain coming out of the microphone, in case the sig-
nal level coming out of the mic is distorted.
It’s going to be pretty hard to get most modern
microphones to distort, but some older models or
types of mics might cause problems. So this little
switch can be a handy tool to use when available —
though it’s mostly used for loud singers and not
spoken word recordings.
Avoid the temptation to use a “radio voice” or
affect an accent during your podcast. Unless
you’re going for a special effect, it sounds
unnatural and could turn your listeners off.
Computer mixers
Both Mac and Windows operating systems have vol-
ume controls built in, commonly used to control the
levels for things like CD audio or sound coming from
the Internet. One of the controls affects the volume

in the mixer itself or in a separate box. Some also
include analog-to-digital converters that allow you
to plug the preamp directly into the computer, using
a USB or FireWire cable. Your signal chain looks
something like Figure 18-2.
• Figure 18-2: Audio travels from the mic through the
preamp into the computer.
The normal process to set up a mic preamp uses a
few simple steps:
1.
Connect the mic to the preamp, usually with an
XLR cable, as shown in Figure 18-3.
• Figure 18-3: The XLR jack.
2.
Connect the preamp to the analog-to-digital
converter to the computer, depending on
whether the preamp contains converters.
Figure 18-4 shows what this setup looks like.
3.
Talk into the mic and use the onboard meters to
set the correct level, as shown in Figure 18-5.

3.
Find the volume control in the window that
comes up and adjust the volume as necessary.
Digital distortion is not forgiving, and it never
sounds good during a podcast. The best place to
start is setting each volume control past the first
one at –6 dB and making sure that the level remains
constant from there. Depending on the devices you
include in the chain, you may have to make slight
adjustments here and there. Avoiding large changes
in volume late in the chain if possible is best. 
Sound-recording program
The final stage of the signal chain is the program
you’re using to record audio. If you’ve used gain
staging correctly, you should be getting a good,
consistent signal without adjusting the volume con-
trol for that track. You use these controls later to
mix the tracks used in the podcast, so leave these
controls alone as much as possible. Large adjust-
ments at this stage might indicate the need to go
back and look at previous gain stages for adjust-
ments there.
Working with External Devices
Depending on your equipment budget and needs, you
might have some external devices, either hardware or
software, that you insert into the signal chain. These
devices can either boost or cut the signal gain and
change the tonal properties of the audio. Used judi-
ciously, they can make your product sound very pro-
fessional. But if you go crazy with them, your original
signal could get lost in a wash of effects and tricks,
lost forever inside an audio morass. Be careful when
inserting devices into the signal chain — less can
often be more.
External preamps
An external preamp goes between the microphone
and the computer, allowing you to boost the signal
going into the recording. These preamps are either

• Figure 18-4: Analog-to-digital converters can use USB or
FireWire connections.
• Figure 18-5: The preamp meter.
Some mics designed for computer use already go
straight into a USB connection: An external preamp
can’t be used with that kind of mic.
Compressors and limiters
Compressors and limiters are devices that help
smooth out signals and keep levels from getting
(respectively) either too low or too high. If used,
these are often inserted right after preamps in the
signal chain. Concentrate on getting a good, strong
signal first, and then use these devices to enhance
your sound.
For more information on compressors and
limiters, flip forward to Practice 23.
Software plug-ins

mic and the computer, a plug-in is a software-based

program inserted into the sound-recording program.
Plug-ins simulate physical devices such as compres-
sors, limiters, and other effects units. Just like their
hardware counterparts, they can enhance or destroy
your audio, depending on how they’re used — so
you want to be careful when applying them to your
podcast. Again, it’s best to concentrate on a clear,
strong signal at this point — before you start apply-
ing effects.
The big advantage to using software plug-ins is the
Undo command — which makes it possible to take
back a huge mistake if you happen to make one. Just
delete the plug-in or use Undo to go back, and there’s
no harm, no foul. That Undo option isn’t available
when recording through hardware. Many engineers
swear by hardware, however, and maintain that soft-
ware emulation never equals hardware quality.
The best test is to let your ears decide. Your budget
and technical knowledge might have some input
here, as well. Above all, remember what your gain-
staging technology should give you:

A clear, understandable audio signal

A lack of noise

A lack of distortion


Level It Out
After the audio is recorded, you can start putting
everything in its place volume-wise. Depending on
how many voices or music tracks you want to
include in your podcast, you may have to move only
a couple volume controls — or you might have to
manage a multitude of vocal and music tracks. The
examples in this section were taken from Apple
Soundtrack Pro, but similar controls exist in Adobe
Audition, Audacity, Pro Tools, GarageBand, and more.
One familiar form is the per-track volume control,
where there’s a slider on each track (as shown in
Figure 18-6).

Level It Out
141
• Figure 18-6: Track volume controls.
Another familiar form is the mixer view — the on-
screen version of the familiar analog mixer, which
has looked much the same since analog mixers were
invented (see Figure 18-7).
• Figure 18-7: Mixer volume controls.
Finally, you can automate the volume level with soft-
ware controls (Figure 18-8 shows an example). This
is useful if you want to have the volume change at
different times in the podcast; Practice 20, for exam-
ple, shows how to do just that when you’re setting
levels for bed music. You just set the two gain
points, and the computer automatically reduces
or increases the volume over the length of time
between the two points. It’s like knowing where
you’re starting and where you want to end up, and
letting the computer take care of the driving.
• Figure 18-8: An automated volume curve.
You use these tools to adjust each track’s volume in
the overall presentation. Fortunately, you won’t be
tweaking all of them all the time. You probably won’t
use all of them in a normal podcast, and you don’t
have to worry about what you don’t use. And it’s
easy to categorize the controls according to what
you want to emphasize. Read on. . . .
First things first
Decide what is most important for the audience to
hear and make sure that clip is the loudest one at all
times. In most cases, that’s going to be your voice —
and the voices of anybody else on the podcast. At
other times, it could be the music you’re playing or
the theme music to your show. In any case, the clip
you’re emphasizing needs to be the loudest —
without creating any distortion.
When you’ve set a good, strong, clear level for that
clip, you can insert the other clips and adjust their
volume so they can be heard without overpowering
the vocals. As an example, in the next section we
take a look at putting some music behind the talking.

Practice 18: Setting Acceptable Sound Levels
142
The intro is the spoken word for the podcast,
and the theme is the background music. You’re
going to balance these correctly.
3.
Click the label for Track 1 and rename this
track Vocals. Then click the label for Track 2
and rename it Music. 
Labeling tracks is a nice way to keep your
audio projects organized. Take that extra step
and get into the habit of setting up your multi-
track projects this way.
4.
Find the location where you saved the two
files. Select PodcastTheme.aif and import it
into the Music track.
5.
Click the small triangle to the left of the Music
label to expand the Music track, as shown in
Figure 18-9. 
This is how you access the Volume control on
individual tracks.
Setting music levels 
Many podcasts include music under any vocal intro-
ductions (or even throughout the whole podcast),
so it’s important to know how to balance the level of
music with that of the spoken word. The trick is to
keep the vocals high enough to be heard and under-
stood, but at the same time, let the music provide
the atmosphere for the podcast. This section shows
you how to balance the levels in Soundtrack Pro, but
the concepts and general directions are applicable
in many audio-editing programs.
Follow these steps to set music levels:
1.
Launch your audio-editing program.
2.
Insert the Expert Podcasting Practices
For Dummies DVD into your computer’s 
drive and find the Practice 18 folder. Copy

you can make changes on the Master Track at
the bottom of the Timeline window.
By the way, you’re setting the control point here
(as shown in Figure 18-10) because you want the
theme to decrease volume at this point.
7.
Pressing the right-arrow key, progress in the
Timeline to 00:00:10.00 and double-click the
point where the edit line and volume level
intersect.
Doing so creates a second control point, which is
the point where you want the volume to end up.
8.
Click and drag the new control point down to
–19.00 dB, as shown in Figure 18-11.
Notice how the level dips down at the first point
you created. Now, using the second control
point, you set the level for the rest of the music.
9.
Import the PodcastIntro.aif file into the
Vocals track.
Many audio-editing programs give a variety of
options for viewing your tracks. You can make
your audio tracks appear larger, making non-
destructive editing easier. Another way to
view your tracks is by zooming in and out by
increments. Check your program’s manual for
more information.
6.
Pressing the right-arrow key, progress in your
Timeline to 00:00:05.00 and double-click the
point where the edit line and volume level
intersect. 
This intersection is a control point that you can
designate in any of the various envelopes (an
audio term that represents an aspect of the
audio clip, such as Volume, Pan, Pitch Shifter,
and other effects over time). It’s a pivot point
where you can change values of the effects on
the individual track. To affect the entire project,

where the audio will be played, such as the
needle on a record) back to the beginning and
then review the change. If you need to, add
more control points to adjust the levels at criti-
cal points.
Note that this music (composed in GarageBand)
swells from time to time. You establish the con-
trol points to compensate; the last point returns
the volume level to –19.00 dB.
11.
Return the playhead to the beginning and then
review your changes. Find the break in your
audio (at the line “. . . the process of podcast-
ing”) and add a control point there.
12.
Pressing the right-arrow key, progress ten sec-
onds forward in your Timeline and then create
a control point here.
Here’s where you create a fade-out for the theme.
13.
With this new control point in place, click and
drag the point down to –96.00 dB.
Doing so fades out your music.
When you’ve made a lead-in with some music under-
neath, the next task is mix the outro:
1.
Move the playhead to the end of the audio.
2.
Move back into the Vocals track to the break
in the audio just before you hear, “And if you
want to find out more about me. . . .”
This break should happen at approximately

Practice 18: Setting Acceptable Sound Levels
146
Working with audio takes practice, and with every
audio project you create, you will develop your own
ear for what sounds balanced and level, as well as
what may sound too harsh or too soft.
You have now created an effective fade-in and fade-
out of audio, with a segment of music from the DVD
providing a background intro and a signal to listen-
ers that the show episode is coming to a close.

Adding Special
Effects
W
hen you start podcasting, a good rule is to keep it simple. That’s
easy to do, sure, especially if you want to crank out your
episodes and spend only a day or two editing and mixing in any
music. “Keeping it simple” gets tougher to do, though, when you explore
some of the higher-end audio programs and the cool bells and whistles
they offer. Filters. Effects. Audio loops. With so many cool toys to play
with, your mind begins to get a little crazy mulling over everything you
can do with all these extra touches.
That is the trick in mastering all those wacky special effects and royalty-
free music loops — playtime. Some of the coolest effects you can come
up with for your podcast simply happen from sitting behind the applica-
tion and playing with it. While we can’t teach you how to play with
effects, we can take a simple scene from a podcast (provided on the
DVD) and dive into your application’s filters and effects, and add a new
depth to what begins as a very static scene.
Along the way, we also talk about permissions, licenses, and when too
much is too much.
Adding in Foley Effects and Filters
Foley effects are studio-quality sound effects of the simple, everyday
moments of life captured and then edited or dropped into works of audio
or video. The term gets its name from sound-effects pioneer Jack Foley
who, in the 1930s, took the art of sound very seriously in Hollywood. His
work in getting sound to work with motion pictures set standards still
used today. In fact, people who create these sounds and even manipulate
them to work for other productions are known as Foley artists.
In this practice, you turn into a Foley artist as you add in sound effects.
On the DVD, find the file BilliBaddings_ch8_scene. This audio is taken
from the podcast of Billibub Baddings and The Case of The Singing Sword.

Practice 19: Adding Special Effects
148
What you are going to accomplish here is sweetening
up a setting with only a few Foley effects and filters
commonly found in pro audio software. You add a
door sound effect, and then you slowly build on the
effects to create a setting for this scene.
First, listen to the scene as is:
1.
From the DVD, copy the folder marked
Practice 19 to any location on your com-
puter. Then launch your audio editor and use it
to find and import the audio BilliBaddings_
ch8_scene from the Practice 19 folder on
your computer. 
In this practice, we show you how to add sound
effects using Apple’s Soundtrack Pro (Version
2.0.1), shown in Figure 19-1. The audio is a pretty
straightforward read of the moment Billi meets
Al Capone face to face for the first time. You
want to set the scene by adding in sound effects
at key moments. 
2.
Play the audio and listen to the five-minute file.
If you’re using a different editing program than
Soundtrack Pro, you can easily translate these steps
to your application. Before you begin, check the
documentation of your application to find out how
to import external audio sources.
Applying basic sound effects to audio
Sound effects, or that part of sound design simply
called Foley, can come included with digital audio
workstations (such as Soundtrack Pro and Audition)
or can be purchased from places like Digital Juice
(described later in this practice). Working with
Foley to bring in a sense of realism or put together a
“theater of the mind” can be a lot of fun. This kind of
post-production can also be just as time-consuming
as creating the podcast itself. However, it takes only
a little bit of extra effort and strategic placement of
Foley to bring a scene to life or add a new dimension
to your podcast.
• Figure 19-1: With the main audio in place, you can now get to sweetening this scene with Foley.

4.
In the audio file, advance another 25 seconds
to the 50-second mark. 
This should place you and your playhead just
before “. . . the light behind me dimmed, fol-
lowed by a soft click.”
5.
Import the file Door Closing.aif and place it
at the 50-second mark in the track labeled SFX.
6.
Review the scene between 00:00:20.00 and
00:00:55.00.
Figure 19-2 shows what you should have at this
point of the practice. If you’re working with
Soundtrack Pro or Audition, this should be a
close match. If you are using Pro Tools, Bias, or
something else, it may not be a mirror reflection
but should still be pretty accurate. 
Follow these steps to add a door sound effect to
your scene:
1.
In the audio file, advance 25 seconds in. 
You should hear (and see in the waveform) a
break in the audio between “ . . . for unscheduled
room service” and “the other ogre opened. . . .” 
2.
Label one of the available tracks SFX.
3.
Import the file Door Opening.aif from the
Practice 19 folder, and place it in the SFX
track.
When you’re dropping in sound effects, any
breaks you find in the audio are the best
places to drop them. If your podcast is
scripted, record with these breaks in mind.
Make notes in your script indicating where
you would like music, sound effects, or any-
thing out of the ordinary.
• Figure 19-2: At 00:00:25.00 and 50.00, the door opens and then closes.

Practice 19: Adding Special Effects
150
Many pro applications (such as Adobe Audition
and Soundtrack Pro) come with a library of
sound effects that are at your disposal. You can
incorporate them into your podcast, or go one
step further and alter them in playback speed
or frequency, creating sound effects custom-
built for your production. 
Right now the opening of the door sounds great, but
you might notice that the door-closing sound effect
drowns out the narration (anything but a soft click).
You can fix that by setting levels, as detailed later on
in this practice. However, you need to make a few
more changes to this scene first.
Adding ambiance to the scene
Later in this scene, Billi describes the opera music
playing on a phonograph. When Tee initially wrote
this scene, he pictured a dimly lit dining room with
Al Capone at the head of a long table, enjoying
his Italian dinner with classical music providing a
backdrop. While the narrative already paints that
scene, you want to create the setting even more
vividly with the sound of a phonograph playing
opera music. You achieve this by bringing in some
new audio and then applying effects to this audio.
Your audio recorder comes with a variety of effects —
specific filters that alter or creatively manipulate the
audio in your project. Much like that spiffy new
mixer board with all its sliders, knobs, and features,
the sheer number of effects (not to mention the
options for each of them) can appear daunting.
What you want to do with these effects so you know
what they can do for you is actually pretty simple:
You play with them. Experiment, tinker, and go from
one extreme to the next, eventually coming up with
a sound perfect for the mood, character, or setting
you want to create. (For more on audio effects and
what you can do with them, check out Episode 5 of
Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast on
the enclosed DVD.)
With the right application of effects — both Foley
and audio — your podcast gains a sense of depth
and perspective. Sure, the investment of time grows
(exponentially, it feels like), but the end result is
well worth it.
That is what you are going to do, right now: Set the
scene between the detective and Al Capone with
the right application of audio and effects. Here’s the
blow-by-blow:
1.
Move in your audio project to 00:00:43.00. 
This is right before “Continuing into the next
room. . . .” 
2.
Label one of the available tracks Music.
3.
Import the file 3 Pie Jesu.aif from the
Music folder of the Practice 19 folder and place
it into the Music track.
Vocalist Gwynn Fulcher (shown in Figure 19-3)
graciously granted Tee permission to use two
selections from her 2002 recital for this lesson.
She is the operatic voice in the background of
this dinner.
• Figure 19-3: Vocalist Gwynn Fulcher provides some
dinner music for the mob of 1929 Chicago.
She is also an artist understanding the
benefits of sharing her music with
podcasters, as discussed in Practice 20.
Tee also loves arias by Charlotte Church and
Kiri Te Kanawa, especially when backed by the
National Symphony Orchestra, but he cannot
use those performances on account of copy-
right laws. Although the music may be in
public domain, the performances are pro-
tected — and only the rights-holders can grant
permission. Because Gwynn Fulcher owns all
rights for distribution of her recital recordings,
she can grant Tee permission to use them in
this example. (For more on this topic, take a
closer look at Practice 20’s section on
Copyright 101.)

4.
Place 3 Pie Jesu.aif into a new track at
00:00:43.00.
You don’t need to listen to this end result just yet,
but if you’re feeling brave, you can. You have music
against the main audio track and the whole thing
sounds like a train wreck; that’s because nothing is
mixed. All the audio in this scene is competing to be
heard, and the current project sounds like a lot of
sound files haphazardly thrown together.
Okay, now you’re going to play around with levels.
Setting levels
So you have the basic elements built into the scene,
but right now everything is too loud. So you need to
go in and set your volume levels. Levels refer to the
decibel (dB) level at which each audio track is play-
ing. Depending on which sound you want to have
precedence and what sets the background, your lev-
els can vary from track to track. 
Follow these steps to set levels to appropriate vol-
umes and make sure everything sounds right:
1.
For your audio editor, find the SFX track’s vol-
ume control and reduce it to –4.50 dB.
You could leave the volume level at 0 dB, but for a
door to sound that loud, Billi would practically
have to be nose-to-nose with the doorknob.
Reducing the track’s volume down by –4.5 dB
mutes the sound enough to make it sound natural.
2.
Still in the SFX track, before the door’s closing,
reduce the sound even further to –19.00 dB.
You can do this by establishing control points
in the volume track and adjusting the levels.
Double-click along the Volume Level to estab-
lish these control points.
Applications like GarageBand, Pyro, Audition, and
Soundtrack Pro (shown in Figure 19-4) offer both
global control over track volume and dynamic
control over volume. In Figure 19-4, you use con-
trol points. To find out more about control points
and working with them, see Practices 18 and 21.
• Figure 19-4: Adjusting the sound level in Soundtrack Pro using control points.

Practice 19: Adding Special Effects
152
Mute the music track and play the clip between
00:00:25.00 and 00:00:55.00. You now hear that the
door closing is far softer. This stands to reason
because when Billi has entered this room, the
door would sound further away, slightly distant.
Now if you muted the music track, unmute it 
and proceed to the next step to set the levels
for Gwynn.
3.
In the Music track, set the track volume to
–24.00 dB.
This may seem like a crime, but remember that
Gwynn’s talents are (in this case) merely setting
the ambiance. So while that volume may seem low,
it actually balances out for the rest of the scene.
4.
Save the audio project and then play it for
review.
So where are these numbers (–24 dB, –19 dB, and so
on) coming from? Is there a book out there with all
the music pieces in the world that state, “If you are
mixing Gwynn Fulcher into your podcast, set her
levels at –24 dB if she is in the background”?
Actually, the level settings are coming from Tee’s
own preferences and experiences in mixing audio.
Feel free to experiment with the levels and find your
own preferred balance. You may find that you want
some of your Foley to be louder than what is sug-
gested here. You may also discover that no two
sound effects and no two music pieces mix alike.
You may find you have to adjust throughout some
effects and music beds. It all depends on the desired
setting you are working to achieve. 
Adding the final touches
Listening to this mix, most podcasters would agree
it sounds good — and stop here. Something that
audiences really respect in their podcasts, though,
is an eye (or perhaps ear, in this case) for detail.
What is tricky here is the narration mentioning that
the music is softly playing on a phonograph. Even
the best gramophone of 1929 (which we’re sure
Capone had) did not offer a sound comparable to
the fidelity you get from an iPod.
In these next steps, you apply some additional
sound effects and audio filters to give the back-
ground music that scratchy phonograph sound:
1.
In your DAW’s documentation, find out where
you can apply effects on a single track in a
project. 
Figure 19-5 shows the option to apply an effect
on a track in Soundtrack Pro. Simply select a
track, click the Effects tab (or go to Window➪
Tabs➪Effects) and then click and drag your
desired effect into the window. 
2.
Make sure that Music is the selected track
where you want to apply the following effect. 
3.
In the Effects menu of your sound application,
find the Exciter effect. 
The Exciter effect is a common filter found in
many audio applications that changes the tex-
ture of an audio signal. It can brighten the treble
in sound and mimic the qualities of over-the-
phone or walkie-talkie audio. While many appli-
cations offer their own built exclusively for
effects, some filters (including the Exciter effect)
can be found from application to application,
program to program:
 Echo: Applies to audio, based on the decay
set in the filter, a slight delay, repeating what-
ever is spoken or recorded. The greater the
decay, the greater the delay.
 Reverb: Similar to echo, reverb adds a boom-
ing quality or slight hollowness to audio,
mimicking the sound of recording in a large
room or concert hall.
 Flanger: A flanger changes various frequen-
cies found in audio, warping the final audio
and giving it an old-style-science-fiction,
robotic quality.
 Phase shifter: Similar to the flanger, a phase
shifter not only changes the tone of recorded
audio but also layers additional copies of the
audio signal on top of it, making it sound like
five, six, or seven voices, all speaking at vari-
ous tones. This effect is reminiscent of 1970s
horror-film announcers.

Enclosed on this DVD is the first season of Wiley
Publishing’s popular podcast, Podcasting For
Dummies: The Companion Podcast. Episode
Five discusses some of the different qualities
these various effects have on a recording.
4.
Hit Play on your audio editor and adjust the
Exciter filter to give the music a bright, tinny
sound, almost as if the vocalist is singing over a
telephone.
The interface may be different from application
to application, but the filter behaves roughly the
same. For Figure 19-6, the Exciter’s Harmonics
are set at 169 percent, and the Frequency is set
at 1700 Hz. The quality of Gwen’s voice is dra-
matically changed, making it sound tinny, as if
coming through an old gramophone’s horn.
Figure 19-6 shows what the Exciter filter looks
like in Soundtrack Pro.
• Figure 19-6: To re-create the phonograph sound, set the
Exciter’s Frequency to 1700 Hz and the
Harmonics to 169%.

an effect and then click and drag it into the
window associated with the selected track

you cannot tell where they start and when
they stop), making an effect such as this one
easy to create and then implement in a proj-
ect. Check your audio software’s documenta-
tion to see if it includes such a utility or if
freeware is included in the installation.
9.
In the track volume for Record Player, lower
the volume to –28.50 dB.
10.
For both the Record Player and Music tracks,
create a five second fade up from –96.00 dB to
the current settings by expanding the Track
Controls and establishing control points (as
described in Step 2 of “Setting levels,” earlier
in this practice). 
With a five-second fade up for both sound
effects, you gradually bring the background into
the action, creating the atmosphere. You create 
a similar fade-out in just a moment. Figure 19-8
gives you a general idea of how this process
looks on-screen.
Next, you give this Foley the last sound effect of
a scratchy phonograph.
5.
Label one of the available tracks in your DAW
Record Player.
6.
Import the file Pop-Scratch Effect
Loop.aif from the SFX folder of Practice 19
and place it in the Record Player track.
7.
Place this sound effect to coincide with the
beginning of “Pie Jesu” in the Music track.
See Figure 19-7 for a reference.
8.
Continue this sound effect underneath the per-
formance in the Music track.
Every DAW handles looped SFX differently. The
easiest way is to copy the new sound effect 
and then repeatedly paste it (pressing Ctrl+V 
or Ú+V) into the track.
Many audio applications come with mini-
applications that can create loops (sound
effects or music riffs that repeat so seamlessly
• Figure 19-7: This sound effect should start at the same time as the music. Line up the Pop Scratch sound effect with the
beginning of Pie Jesu so that both start at the same time.

155
14.
In the Track Volume for both the Music and
Record Player tracks, create a control point for
the beginning of a fade-out.
15.
At 00:04:59.00, create control points in both
the Music and Record Player tracks and fade
both tracks down to –96.00 dB, creating a grad-
ual fade-out that draws people into the scene.
(See Figure 19-9.)
When you listen to the five-minute scene again,
you should notice a depth to it that was lacking
earlier. With the application of effects, Foley, and
levels, you now have an atmosphere for the
upcoming dialogue between dwarf detective
Billibub Baddings and Gangland crime boss Al
Capone. You can find the final version of the
scene in the lesson folder. Look for the file
named Practice19-final.aif.
11.
Two seconds after “Pie Jesu” finishes on the
Music track, drop in the 6 Biest du dei
Mir.aif file from the Practice 19 folder.
You are bringing in a second track here so it
appears as if the record is still playing, and this
is the next song.
12.
Extend the Pop-Scratch Effect Loop.aif
sound effect in the Record Player track under-
neath the performance in the Music track.
You extend the sound effect underneath the new
audio to remain consistent in how the songs
would sound when playing through the phono-
graph. Otherwise, the music continues, but the
sound of pops and scratches stops. When apply-
ing this kind of Foley touch, be consistent.
13.
Jump to 00:04:53.00 in your audio project, close
to the end of the words “good conversation.”

Sound effects can be found far and wide, and you
can find them in a number of ways — online, on CD,
on old tapes and records, and in your own imagina-
tion. Depending on the venue, what you get varies in
quality, but you never have to worry about coming
up empty-handed in the pursuit of effects for your
podcast.
Online searches and Web sites
Long before the days of podcasting, enthusiastic
audiophiles were posting some of their favorite
sound effects online and offering them as free down-
loads. These effects ran the gamut from simple
cartoon sound effects to classic one-liners from
motion pictures. This range is why, if you embark on
a Google-search for sound effects, be careful. The
range of quality with these AIF and WAV files goes
from digital-clear to “What was that again?” Also,
you need to worry about licenses and copyrights.
Audiences appreciate these final touches because
there is a thought process behind the application of
sound effects and special effects. The “Continuing
forward . . .” line ushers in the fade-up into the
music. The music is far from perfect; record pops
and scratches attest to that. The distance between
where Billi stood and the door is also evident here.
All these touches indicate the podcaster’s care for
the production and the intent of the scene being set. 
Pretty cool, huh?
Where Else Can I Find All These
Cool Special Effects?
Soundtrack Pro, Audition, GarageBand, Peak, and
Cubase all come with music loops and sound effects
ready for use — but for the previous example, you
needed an effect (the record pops) that none of
these applications provided.

SoundDogs 
We were in a serious pinch when we couldn’t find a
vintage camera flash sound effect, and while search-

and of good quality, we came across SoundDogs
(www.sounddogs.com). SoundDogs is one part data-
base of SFX vendors, one part search engine for
high-quality SFX, and a one-stop-shop for high-qual-
ity SFX collections. We happened to find the vintage
flash effect on the Dog Pack #3: Mixed Bag and were
so happy with the quality that we picked up Dog
Pack #4 on an impulse. Reasonably priced and easy-
to-download collections, SoundDog is a good place
to start building your library.
Digital Juice
Tee blames New York Times Bestseller Tracy Hickman
for turning him on to the Juice (www.digital
juice.com), shown in Figure 19-11. Digital Juice is
hardly cheap . . . at first glance. What makes Digital
Juice the podcaster’s best friend is how high quality
the product is, the professionalism of its tech sup-
port, and the versatility of everything it offers in the
way of audio and video media. Tee’s first purchase
was the Digital Juice SoundFX Library, a collection
of over 10,000 professional-grade, royalty-free SFX.
The package of CDs normally sold for $700. Digital
Juice was having a special and selling it for $250.
You might not think about copyrights when it
comes to sound effects, but the earlier warning
about using copyright music also holds true for
many sound effects. For example, if you are
using the chirpity-chirp-chirp communicator
sound effect from Star Trek in your podcast,
you risk Paramount sending you a cease-and-
desist because it owns the rights to the effect.
The same holds true for the Gate effect from
the Stargate franchise and the unmistakable
sound of that incredible car from Chitty Chitty,
Bang Bang. These examples of sound effects
are copyrighted and trademarked.
Freesound Project
The Freesound Project (http://freesound.iua.
upf.edu) could be best described as a Magnatune
or Podsafe Music Network, only for Foley artists.
Working with Creative Commons–licensed sounds,
Freesound (shown in Figure 19-10) focuses only on
sound effects, not songs. The group strives to offer
high-quality sound effects — which you can find eas-
ily via its search engines — and cultivates commu-
nity through forums and awareness. As long as you
mention in your podcast that the sound effects are
coming from Freesound, you have access to a vari-
ety of SFX for free. It’s a terrific site and resource.

royalty-free collections where you’re lucky if you get
one or two really usable tracks, Tee has some discs

D.I.Y.
Necessity is the mother of invention. Sometimes the
simplest of sound effects is nowhere to be found, be it
among 10,000 on Digital Juice or online as a free down-
load. You can scour the Internet for hours on end, 
find a collection (which may hit you up for a healthy
chunk of change), and then wait for the collection
either to download via your connection or to arrive
via the post office, but we have an even better idea —
a cost-effective one, too: Take two steps away from
your computer and look at it. You have recording
equipment and audio-editing software. Give it a shot!

winning podcast group, Prometheus Radio Theatre,

Practice 19: Adding Special Effects

Can I See Your License for These Special Effects, Sir?

Okay, you may feel silly repeatedly opening and
closing newspapers, striking two glasses together to
make the sound of a toast, sipping loudly on your
coffee or iced tea, and then recording yourself swal-
lowing your beverage of choice. But Foley artists do
these kinds of things on a daily basis. They create
the sounds that add a new dimension to audio and
video works, and these small details are what make
your podcasts unique experiences. If you have the
equipment, take advantage of it and create your own
SFX. In a pinch, what you create can work just as
effectively as the SFX created by the pros.
Can I See Your License for
These Special Effects, Sir?
When you listen to podcasts about how to podcast
(such as the Podcasting For Dummies podcast,
Podholes, or Jason Van Orden’s Podcast Underground),
you’ll hear all of us talk about royalty-free music and
sound effects. Something you might hear us say is,
“When you buy it, it’s yours. You own it.”
This is a quick-and-dirty way of saying “Yes, you
have purchased permission to play the music as much
as you like,” but not all royalty-free vendors are cre-
ated equal, and licenses are very important to pay
attention to. They help you stay unsummoned and
unsued.
End-User License Agreements
An End User License Agreement is usually posted or
comes with the software you have just purchased.
For example, the ten-dollar CD of sound effects that
you just bought off the rack may have a few para-
graphs on the inside jacket that read, “These sound
effects are granted permission for commercial use
(such as in the office, around the home, and so on)
but not for broadcast use (that is, television, radio,
film — and that means they’re taboo for podcast
use).” 
If you were to purchase a Star Trek sound effects CD,
its inside jacket uses only one sentence for its
license agreement: 
WARNING: unauthorized reproduction of
any recordings contained in this album is
prohibited by Federal Law and subject to
criminal prosecution.
License agreements don’t get more clear-cut
than that.
Demystifying Digital Juice’s license agreement
For Digital Juice, the license agreement grants the
user a touch more flexibility:

You can use Digital Juice’s music (and even
sound effects) for opening fanfares, background
music, and the like. However, you can’t use the
music as performance or foreground music 
(say, music heard over the phone while on hold
or as the basis for your own song). 

You can use the sound effects and music of
Digital Juice as enhancements in your media
(that is, as a part of your video, narration, slide
presentations, radio or television productions,
and such). Additionally, you have permission
to alter the sound effect or music to fit your
production’s needs.
So what can’t you do with Digital Juice’s stuff? Just
because you bought music or SFX from Digital Juice
doesn’t mean you own it outright, so you can’t do
any of the following:

Resell it. (This means burning your own CDs and
selling the stock music as is, reworking mixes to
create your own and then selling them, and writ-
ing accompanying vocals to its music and pass-
ing it off as your own.)

Practice 19: Adding Special Effects
160

Post Digital Juice SFX on your Web site for
download.

Store it on a network server for everyone to use. 
That kind of distribution is either prohibited or
requires a different license. 
For all the details in Digital Juice’s license, you can
visit the Digital Juice Web site and look at any of its
Products windows. In the Overview window is a link
for Royalty-Free End-User License Agreement, which
explains everything clearly. (That’s something else
we love about its Web site!)
The point is that while you do own permission to do
stuff with special effects and music you purchase,
there are limits. Make sure you check out the details
in all the license agreements, and make sure you’re
not tempting fate — or someone’s legal team, for
that matter. 
Too Much of a Good Thing Is . . .
Too Much
Can you overdo it with special effects and music?
Absolutely. In the five-minute sample provided for
this practice, you could have added in footsteps and
even the sounds of silverware against a plate. There
is also the temptation to add in room noise or
reverb into a conversation to give it that realistic
room echo. There are a lot of possibilities. What you
need to ask yourself is whether the production is
helping or hindering the intent and message of your
podcast.
Whenever you make changes to audio proj-
ects, it’s a good idea to back up ten seconds
(or more) before the new edit and then play
it. This way you get an idea of what is happen-
ing before the change and get a good handle
on the timing heading into the new edit.
Even if you scale back “realistic” effects (that is,
sounds of nature, music, outside traffic, and room
noise), try listening to sweetened scenes with an
objective ear and an open mind. Overdoing it can
entail more than just the time dedicated to compos-
ing or procuring just the right kind of music.
Another real risk is overengineering a podcast until
the content is lost in a sea of special effects and
post-production smoke and mirrors. The experience
of listening to highly produced podcasts like this
one should bring a smile to your face, and not give
you a splitting headache and make you more than
ready to say, “Enough!”
Controlling the inner composer
Tee was working with GarageBand (version 2) when he
podcast Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana. One of
many reasons he chose to use that software was because
of the hundreds of music loops he had access to. He
wanted to use music for themes, bridges between scenes,
and setting moods. (Yeah, he likes moods in his podcasts.)
In the second chapter of Morevi (third episode), he had his
first segue. He started playing. He continued to play. And
play. And play. With GarageBand, he changed pitches,
tempos, and instruments in all the various riffs and loops
he was playing with. The final composition was (if he does
say so himself) an impressive piece capturing the emotion
and turmoil Askana grappled with in the moment.
Those ten seconds of music took him only 21⁄2 hours to
compose. 
When it comes to drawing the line for post-
production and adding in the next dimension
of your podcast, always ask yourself these
questions: 

Is this extra step really needed? 

Do I really want to dedicate more time to the
post-production of this podcast? 

Too Much of a Good Thing Is . . . Too Much
161
Will listeners appreciate the extra effort? Sure, provided
the content of the podcast is not lost. No matter how
good the production quality of your podcast is, good
content is what keeps your listeners subscribed. The
content of each episode is paramount, and the amount
of post-production you put into the episode should
work with the content, not compete against it for listen-
ers’ attention. Invest the right amount of time and effort
specifically for your podcast, and you will find the bal-
ance best suited for you.
Now that you have a taste of what you can do with
sound effects, go play! It’s the best way to find out
exactly what you can do — and what you’ll want to
do with your podcast’s production values.

ou’re ready to kick off your podcast. You could do what Ron Moore
does on his Battlestar Galactica podcast and welcome your listen-
ers to whichever episode or special treat he is introducing you to,
or you can search for a good opening theme.
But if you want that opening theme to be Bear McCreary’s primal, tribal
opening to Battlestar Galactica, there may be issues. (No, frak that —
there will be issues, as in legal issues!)
This means you need to know where to find good music for your podcast,
and while you’re shopping around, you may want to think about having
the music — especially if you really like it — playing throughout your
podcast. This kind of music is also commonly referred to as bed music —
a track dedicated to providing an aural backdrop for your podcast.
Music-as-backdrop can remedy incurable ambient noise and set a pleas-
ant atmosphere for your show hosts and guests — but a little bit can go a
long way.
Where to Find Good Music
As mentioned elsewhere in this book, good music that’s available free (or
at least affordably) to podcasters isn’t hard to find, provided you know
where to look.
Magnatune
Magnatune (www.magnatune.com) is a favorite site for many podcasts;
it offers quality mp3 downloads of independent musicians of all genres,
of all backgrounds (see Figure 20-1). Users can perform a search for a
style, a specific instrument, or an artist they may have heard on another
podcast. All search results appear in a Web page that links back to the
artists and the mp3 offerings.
What makes Magnatune a good choice for your podcast’s musical
demands is that all music featured here is deemed podsafe — you can

Where to Find Good Music

download these high-quality mp3s and use them for
your own production, provided you follow the rules
and guidelines of the Creative Commons 2.5 License.
Podsafe music, contrary to the belief that it features
only obscure talent on par with bands like Wyld
Stallionz and The Lone Rangers, includes music by
professionals. Independent artists have found sites
like Magnatune to be the Napsters of the next genera-
tion — providing their music (and themselves) free
press and publicity, distributing their work world-
wide. That’s because, as a condition of the Creative
Commons agreement, they must be given credit in
the podcast for their music.
• Figure 20-1: Magnatune welcomes listeners with a user-
friendly interface and a variety of musical
styles, all podsafe and waiting for use. 
Magnatune’s other terrific perk is the quality control
in its mp3s. This is a vast improvement over illicit
Web sites promising free mp3 downloads after an
onslaught of flashing banner ads try to snag you into
raffles, contests, and the like, only to palm off audio
that sounds as if it is being played from the bottom
of the barrel (in one of Titanic’s cargo holds).
Magnatune assures listeners that the mp3s are safe
downloads and high-quality in their sound, and
that none of the music offered is in violation of copy-
right laws (as discussed in brief at the end of this
practice). So if you need a cool touch for your pod-
cast, check out what waits for you at Magnatune.
Podsafe Music Network
When it comes to 800-pound podosphere gorillas,
this site is King Kong. Music found here has been
prominently featured on shows like LoveHouse
Radio (www.lovehouseradio.com), The ADD Cast
(www.addcast.net), and The RevUp Review
(www.rev-up-review.co.uk); and has provided
themes for popular podcasts like Scott Sigler’s
The Rookie (Lacunna Coil, “Heaven’s a Lie”) and
Phil Rossi’s Crescent (Chrysalis, “Chrysalis”). This
Web site, of course, is the Podsafe Music Network
(http://music.podshow.com), a staple in
Adam Curry’s Podshow Network. 
The Podsafe Music Network (shown in Figure 20-2)
was the first on the scene that offered podcasters
professional, amateur, and somewhere-in-between
music for free. Its database of musicians and genres
continues to grow, promising the new, the experimen-
tal, and the edgy to audio producers everywhere.
• Figure 20-2: Podshow, the first (and considered by some
to be the best) site to offer podsafe music.

site, take a look at the layout, and you’ll find two
access points here — one for musicians and the
other for podcasters:

means you purchase the music offered and then the
music is yours to use in your podcasts, audio spots,
and other media projects. You don’t have to pay any
additional fees to use this music.
Just because the music is royalty free and you
have purchased the rights to use it does not
mean you “own” this music. Don’t assume that
it is yours to do with as you see fit. You cannot
(for example) sell this music track by track to
other podcasters, nor is it your right to loan
out the music to others. Royalty-free music
vendors have terms of agreements that spell
out what you can and cannot do legally with
their music — ranging from the amount of use
(such as “drop-and-pay” royalty-free music) to
the circumstances in which the music is used
(say, private license versus commercial-use
license). Make sure you understand the terms
of the agreement before you invest in a ven-
dor’s music; also understand that the music —
although it’s in your library — is legally not
your music. 
So why Digital Juice? True, other royalty-free music
vendors are out there, but consistent quality is hard
to find. In some cases, the music is all synthesizers
and drum machines, and at other times, the music
is full orchestration. It’s hard to decide beforehand
what you need, how you’re going to use the composi-
tion, and more importantly, whether the investment
(CDs of royalty-free music range in the hundreds of
dollars) is a sound one. (Pun intended.)
Digital Juice (shown in Figure 20-3) is a step up from
other vendors of royalty-free music vendors in what
it offers to is clientele: fully orchestrated and profes-
sionally produced music pieces.
Digital Juice offers musical beds in the Sound FX
Libraries, and various pieces in both BackTraxx vol-
umes and its extensive StackTraxx Series. Very few, if
any, of its beds rely solely on synth and electronic
percussion. Each piece, whether ten seconds long or
the full three- to four-minute suite, is fully stocked
with brass, woodwinds, guitar, exotic instruments
from world cultures, and even vocal accompaniment.
Digital Juice doesn’t cut corners in its compositions;

Musicians: If you have music that you have all
rights and permissions to record and distribute,
then you will want to register yourself and your
works. This information includes not only your
music, but also your Web site (or your band’s
Web site), where to find albums for sale (iTunes,
CD Baby, and such), and contact information for
the band or musician. Shortly after registration,
your mp3s become part of the database, and
you’re given private access in order to update
your profile with new music. Podcasters should
know about this site in case their podcast fea-
tures someone not registered in the Podsafe
Music Network (PMN). Let your music talent
know about what this site offers and the poten-
tial for publicity.

Podcasters: The second entry for podcasters is
similar to that for musicians; you register as
much information as you have on your show, its
feed, and what it is all about. Your Podsafe Music
Network profile lets visitors know what your
show is all about and also gives others in the
network links to recent genres, bands, and inter-
ests you’ve found on PMN. (After all, it’s a net-
work. You’re helping fellow podcasters by
sharing your discoveries.) Musicians can also
find out more about your show and its message
via your PMN profile.
After setting up your profile, you can surf, sam-
ple, and download safely because all the music
featured on PMN is completely podsafe, just
waiting for you to feature it in a podcast.

Another option (albeit another financial investment
in your podcast) is to look into Digital Juice (www.

the end result is a DVD of superior music that can be
easily applied to your podcast’s needs.

and second-biggest addiction next to
podcasting itself.
Another advantage of Digital Juice is The Juicer
(shown in Figure 20-4), which adds a new degree of
versatility to its music. 
The Juicer goes through the composition you have
selected and separates it into individual tracks. You
can then turn off unwanted instruments or effects
and export the new piece, or isolate only the tracks
you want as separate tracks so that you can mix
and match other pieces. This capability lets users
customize the music to their specific needs. 
If you are a video podcaster or considering the
jump from audio to video podcasting, Digital
Juice also offers superior video products.
Alongside its audio collections, Digital Juice
also offers Jump Backs and Swipes, stock
footage, video animations, and transitions that
give your video podcasts that newsmagazine-
and-broadcast-TV quality. There are also
Editor’s Tookits, Motion Elements, and other
stock animation — in both standard and high-

polish and edge to your video podcast.

Independent Musicians:
Creating a Synergy
When New Zealand author Philippa Ballantine was
planning out her podcast, Whispers at the Edge
(http://whispers.libsyn.com), her goals not
only included giving writing advice but also offering
a look at the culture of New Zealand. The song
“Southern Gael” from Celtic musician Steve
McDonald was her desired opening and closing
theme. It was composed and performed by a New
Zealand native from her hometown of Wellington,
and the song itself set a fun, lively tone. The only
problem was that this independent musician was
already featured on the Etherean Music label
(www.ethereanmusic.com). 
Pip sent his label a query, making it a point to men-
tion she was from Wellington as well and that she
planned attribution within the podcast because the
track would be used for the intro and outro online.
Her expectations were realistic: a polite “no thank
you” at best — and at worst, a reading of leagalese
and statements concerning copyright permission.
The Etherean Music folks did reply. They offered up
“Southern Gael,” along with any of Steve’s tracks,
and then offered to arrange an interview with him if
Pip was interested. Suffice it to say she was.
Pip isn’t the only one to offer (and benefit from) this
opportunity for both podcasters and musicians.
Figure 20-5 shows several musical acts who have
introduced their works to new audiences every-
where via podcasting. 
In the late 1990s and then in the first year or two of
the 2000s, independent musicians were huge sup-
porters of Napster as a means of getting their music
introduced to a wider audience. Podcasting offers
similar opportunities — a new venue for independ-
ent musicians to introduce themselves and find new
audiences for their work.

Independent Musicians: Creating a Synergy
167
Podcasters offer an important bonus from the
Napster-like music services out there: the personal
touch. Show hosts are reaching out to musicians
and independent record labels, asking for permis-
sion to play music on their shows. The trade-off is
typically free promotion on a podcast in exchange
for playing the music, but this new distribution
method is proving itself to be a platform for inde-
pendent musicians, showcasing new and aspiring
talent. Some musicians like Jonathan Coulton with
his Thing a Week and Beatnik Turtles’ Song of the
Day have even gone on to launch their own pod-
casts, producing music for a global audience. The
RIAA may be watching (and listening) closely, but
podcasters are discovering brighter (and, in many
cases, better) voices in music.
Still, there are processes to follow, even on this most
casual of approaches. 
Ask for permission
Oh sure, this may sound like a no-brainer, but for-
mally asking for permission to play a musician’s
work is considered good etiquette. If you’re consid-
ering asking permission from musicians you’ve
found somewhere other than on podsafe music
sites, you’ll want to set up a dialogue to address
some important considerations:

Who you are: “Hi, my name is [your name] . . . “

What you do: “ . . . and I’m planning a podcast
called How Do I Do This? It’s a do-it-yourself kind
of podcast.”

Why you’re talking to them: “ . . . I believe your
music would be perfect for this project.”
Make sure you cover all these aspects in your pitch
e-mail, along with a follow-up (which we get to a bit
later in this practice).
Confirm the proper contact
Even with independent musicians, make certain that
the distribution rightsholder is the one you’re talking
to. While some indie artists do hold all rights to their
music — rights to the music itself, to recordings, and
to performances — some musicians sign contracts
with independent recording studios that hold on to
the distribution rights to the songs. These rightshold-
ers are the ones who grant permissions to play
music on podcasts, radio, television, and other such
forms of distribution — and they will have the final
say on whether (legally) you can or cannot feature
the desired music on your podcast.
Ask the artists whether they own all rights to their
music, including distribution rights. If they don’t,
then ask them, “Who can I talk to about featuring
your music on my podcast?” Once you have the ear
of the right contact, there’s only one more commit-
ment to meet before you can feature this music on
your show.
Pay it forward once permission is granted
Now, there’s a basic difference of assumptions here:
You’ve made a conscious effort to give away your
podcast’s content for free; the indie musician didn’t
really plan to record an album just to give the music
away for people to do with as they pleased. When
a musician is donating time, talent, and the result
of all that effort to your podcast, you should not
take it for granted. As a podcaster with a listener-
ship, you have several ways to compensate the
musician’s work:

Provide links in the show notes and on the
podcast’s blog. Give the musicians involved
with your podcast active links in your show
notes (and on the show’s blog) back to their
Web sites — or (better still) to their URLs in
iTunes and CD Baby.

Give pages and brief bios of the musicians on
your show’s host blog. Create a page in your
blog that’s all about the musicians featured in
your podcast. Give a brief background on the
performers, links to their Web sites, and point
out the artists’ specific contributions to your
podcast (such as opening credits, love theme, or
closing credits).

Give musicians credit for their contributions in
the podcast. A quick nod to the talent — along
the lines of “Theme music by . . .” and “Visit the

The Method to Mixing 
Music with Dialogue
Striking the right balance between dialogue and
music takes patience, time, and a lot of trial and
error. At one moment, you may find that your music
is right where it should be. Then the quality of the
song changes, and now suddenly your voices are
competing with the backdrop.
To set the right balance between your music and
your show’s content, here are a few tips to follow:

Consider whether bed music is really needed.
Keep in mind that when you bring music into
your podcast, the production demands are
stepped up. Is bed music something the podcast
needs or lends itself to, and how much bed
music will you need? Will you need it for a theme
at the beginning and end that lets people know
the episode is (respectively) beginning and
ending? Or will it need a consistent level of
background music to set a mood, tone, or
atmosphere? 
When you incorporate bed music into a podcast,
you should ask whether the podcast really
needs this extra touch. High production values
are always appreciated, but if you can keep it
to the basics, your listeners will appreciate
that, too.

Watch and listen to your levels from beginning
to end. Many podcasters set their levels only
once and then think the job is done. Music of
any kind has a variety of qualities about it, and
these qualities become complicated on crescen-
dos and decrescendos. 
After you have brought in the music you want
to use for your bed, continue to listen to the
podcast with the music playing underneath.
When needed, add in volume control points
and bring your music only a decibel or two
down. A tiny adjustment may be all you need.
band’s Web site . . .” — means a lot to the artists
who graciously give their work to you. It’s free
advertising, as well as a sincere thank you from
the show’s host. Remember, they didn’t have to
give you their music, so step up and give them a
shout out in your show’s outro.
From behind the drums, it’s Geo!
George Hrab (http://geologicrecords.net) is an
independent musician who is finding out firsthand the ben-
efits of working with podcasters. After being featured on
Skepticality, George was invited by the show’s hosts Derek
and Swoopy to Dragon Con 2006 in Atlanta, Georgia. Geo
and his music were soon introduced to podcasters like Mur
Lafferty, Leann Mabry, and others. With such a broad range
in musical styles, podcasters started coming to him asking
for permission to feature his music. George now regards
the gamble of his music giveaway as one that paid off.
“There has been an undeniable increase in sales and digital
downloads,” he says. “More people are going to iTunes
and the like, and then end up buying a physical CD from
CDBaby.” The unexpected windfall is the instant global
reach of his music. “Folks from Australia and Singapore
who should have no idea who I am have downloaded
songs and bought albums. That is purely due to podcasts.”
Not only has the podosphere embraced Geo, but Geo in
turn has returned the admiration with the launching of his
own podcast, the GeoLogic Podcast (http://geologic
podcast.com).

Fair Use 101: What Is and Isn’t “Fair” in Podcasting
169

Keep your music above –30 dB. No, this is not
the magic number, and all music behaves differ-
ently; but on average when music drops down
underneath –30 dB, it begins to resemble an
audio signal bleeding in from some other source.
You want the bed music to have a purpose as
well as a definitive presence — but you don’t
want the music to overpower the content or
message of your podcast. While there will always
be exceptions to the rule, music above –30 dB is
a good average to shoot for in post-production.
Fair Use 101: What Is and Isn’t
“Fair” in Podcasting
Before we get into this, we want to crystal clear
about something: We are not lawyers. (But some-
times we play them on podcasts.) This section
offers general insights about copyrights and fair use,
but none of us writing this book are lawyers. So
when it came time to write a bit about the laws
around copyrights and fair use, we thought, “Why
not talk to a lawyer?” And did we ever find the right
guy — a lawyer who is also a musician! 
And when we asked attorney Robert S. Meitus about
copyrights, fair use, and podcasts, he responded
with an answer for the ages: “Podcasts are tricky.”
Podcasters attempt to stretch the fair use doctrine
to its limits and then see if there’s just a little more
give to it. Fair use is governed by Section 117 of
the Copyright Act and is not limited to criticism,
education, or noncommercial use, as is commonly
believed. This does not mean that you can be doing
a podcast, make zero money at it, use your favorite
science fiction theme as your theme, and then claim
fair use.
Robert states, “There are four factors to analyze
when determining if something is fair use”:

How is the music being used in your podcast?
Is it commercial (as in, is this a money-making
venture?) or noncommercial (not-for-profit,
or for fun and no profit at all)? If it’s non-
commercial, the use is more likely a fair use.
Is it transformative or nontransformative?
Transformative works usually have a socially
beneficial purpose, such as parodies. (A good
example of transformative work is the fan film,
Troops, where Inner Circle’s “Bad Boys” was
used but both Cops and Star Wars were parodied
in this work.) 

Is the underlying work a highly creative work,
such as a song or literature or a less-creative
work, such as a news story? Fair use is more
likely with the latter.

What is the market effect on the underlying
work? This is probably the trickiest part of fair
use. The more effect a use has on the underlying
work’s marketability, the less likely it is to be a
fair use. Insignificant economic impact on the
underlying work favors fair use.

How much of the material is used? Are you
using the whole theme for the podcast, or just a
portion of it? The less you use the copyrighted
material, the more favorably the courts tend to
regard that use — and the likelier it will be
deemed fair use.
Objective rules — such as the “30–60 second rule”
where you are allowed 30 seconds of a song with
no voiceover and 60 seconds if a voiceover is
applied — are myths. There is no objective way to
measure the fair use factors. Rather, courts subjec-
tively weigh all four factors, typically placing the
most importance on the first and fourth. Fair use is
an affirmative defense, which might help you in
court but doesn’t prevent you from being sued in
the first place. 
Robert goes further into the explanation of fair use
and copyright protections with a legal look at what
some have claimed was the precursor to music-in-
podcasting: Napster. “Napster was commercial
(proxy for purchases), nontransformative (whole
songs), and dealt with highly creative works (the
music compositions and sound recordings), and it

Practice 20: Adding Music
170
The best defense you can implement concerning
music for your podcast is to use royalty-free music
from the get-go. For maximum legal safety, stick to
music from Web sites that promote and offer pod-
safe music, or use music from independent artists
only if you have the written permission of the artists
and the rights holders. It’s best to podcast with a
clear conscience — and if you err, err on the better
side of caution.
hurt the market value of the music according to the
courts (people were downloading for free instead of
buying albums). Therefore Napster lost its fair use
defense and, ultimately, the case.” 
When it comes to podcasting, these rules can still
apply. “So let’s say you start up a Sci-Fi at the Movies
podcast. You have a Star Wars soundtrack. Your pod-
cast’s theme would be repetitive, nontransformative,
and could possibly hurt the market by devaluing the
license value of the creative music. The podcast
might have some luck if it’s noncommercial and only
a small amount of music is used; but, this is not a
strong case for fair use.”

Editing Audio after
Editing the Session
O
ne of the greatest gifts of digital audio is the ease of creating a final
product. Anybody who ever had to take a razor blade to tape in
order to splice together a finished master track knows the pain of
making an incorrect final cut and ruining the project. In the land of ones
and zeros, removing a momentary mistake is just an Undo away. You’ve
also gained a great deal of power over a range of processes — from plac-
ing sound clips in tracks to arranging their position and volume to pan-
ning their envelopes in just the right way. Once all that’s done, you’ll
want to create a master file of your edited podcast to prepare for release.
You may still have to do some editing, but the heavy lifting is done.
You’re ready to do some precision surgery at this point.
Choosing the Format for Your Audio File
Once your mix is done, you’re going to create a final file to use for the
rest of the work on your podcast. You’re not quite ready to send it on to
the listeners yet; you’re just going to add the finishing touches to your
final mix. The first step is to choose the format of your final file. Many
programs have their own default formats — and for the most part they’re
interchangeable. Your main concern at this point is making sure that all
your information is retained during the post-production process — and
that requires an uncompressed format.
Keep it uncompressed to make it larger than life
Compression is a word that’s thrown about quite a bit in audio produc-
tion; unfortunately, it can have a couple of different meanings. When
applied to audio, as in a vocal track, it applies to an effect that brings
down higher volume levels and raises lower volume levels to produce a
smooth, even track. When applied to a data file (such as your podcast’s
final mix), compression means a reduction in the file size without losing
a terrible amount of sound quality. You’ll compress your file when you

create an mp3 or AAC file of your podcast. For now,

uncompressed. You’re going to want the maximum
amount of audio quality you can get when you make
cuts or apply effects to your podcast. These edits
will sound better when you’re working with a full
audio file, and not the digital photocopy you get
from a compressed file.
When you’re making a compressed audio file,
always start with an uncompressed file.
Making a compressed file from an already-
compressed file can further reduce audio
quality and create artifacts (extraneous noises)
that can turn off a listener.
Uncompressed file types: Wave and AIFF
There are two main types of uncompressed audio
files; either one will give you good results:

Wave files (marked with the file extension .WAV)
are often found in Windows-based programs, and
this file format is the default setting for Adobe
Audition and other audio editors. 

AIFF files are traditionally found more on Mac-
based systems, but these days it’s easier to
interchange these formats between operating
systems than it used to be. 
Using the default for whichever program you choose
should be okay.
Sample rates
Both WAV and AIFF files can have different bit rates
and sample rates, depending on the capabilities of
your audio-editing program and hardware. (See
Practice 24 for more on bit rates and sample rates.)
Every audio program you’d want to use with a pod-
cast is capable of CD-quality audio (16-bit, 44.1kHz).
If your audio is at a lower resolution, you won’t see
a benefit from exporting at a higher level. You’ll also
just end up creating an unnecessarily large file size
because all that extra data has to go somewhere.
Choose a sample rate consistent with your record-
ing, and you’ll be ready to go.
Exporting Your Goods
This process used to be called mixing down by music
producers in Hawaiian shirts and studio tans. It’s
received the more computer-oriented term exporting
now, but it represents the same thing: You’re taking
the multiple tracks you’ve put together and convert-
ing them into a stereo file. Luckily, you don’t have to
roll tape and man the mixing board to get everything
right. You’ve already set the levels — and maybe even
automated any volume changes — in your music
beds and sound effects. You just have to issue a few
commands, and everything else is automated.
Exporting with Soundtrack Pro
Let’s take a look at exporting a file in Soundtrack
Pro. At this point, the mix is finished, and you just
want a final file. First, choose File➪Export from the
menu bar, as shown in Figure 21-1. From here you
have several choices:
• Figure 21-1: Export choices start here.
With Compressor (there’s that word again) gives
you several presets to choose from when creating
your final file, as shown in Figure 21-2. You’re going
to be primarily concerned with the audio formats,
unless you’re producing a video podcast. Look at
these options:

Exporting Your Goods
173
You can also just export selected tracks —
the usual option if you’re sending individual
tracks to be mixed elsewhere. For creating your
podcast, the With Compressor or the Export
Mix commands are more appropriate. If you’ve
taken the time to create a full mix, you’ll want
all the ingredients to be in the final product. 
• Figure 21-3: The Export Mix option gives you an AIFF
final file.
Rendering the file
Don’t be surprised if it takes a few minutes to
create your final file. This process is a little more
time-intensive than saving a text document. The
computer is rendering (a fancy computer term for
creating) all the files and commands in your mix
to create the final file, and that can take a little time.
It won’t take as long as the actual program, though;
you may just have time to go grab a cup of coffee
while you’re waiting instead of making a grocery run.
The process will take longer for longer programs or
higher resolutions, but it shouldn’t take too long.
• Figure 21-2: From these export presets, you can choose a
degree of compression.

The AAC formats are already compressed audio,
so you’re going to want to pass over those. 

The AIFF files are followed by their resolutions
(sample rate, then bit rate), and you can
choose the one most appropriate for your
recording. 
After you select an AIFF option, just choose what
to name your file and where to save it. Your final
mix is finished.
Export Mix automatically selects an AIFF file, and all
you have to choose are the sample and bit rates.
(See Figure 21-3.)

If you’re in a hurry, turn off other programs

puter and get the track done faster.
Making Edits: The First Cut
Is the Deepest
There are a few edits that can easily be accomplished
on a final file that might be a little more difficult in
the mixer view of your project. You can clip out small
segments of audio, move sections of your program
around, or take out unwanted silence. First, open the
audio file you’ve just exported and listen to it.
Performing a nip and tuck
You should always listen to the file you create before
you make it available to the public, and you may
find places where you want to take out a section of
audio. At the very least, you’ll want to hear what the
file sounds like and make sure it’s ready for distribu-
tion. Removing those audio sections may or may not
be necessary. 
If you don’t want to stop playback while you’re
doing this, you can press M in Soundtrack Pro (F8 in
Audition) to add a reference marker to indicate
where to go back to later. When you’re ready to
make your cut, highlight the section of the audio
you want by clicking and dragging your cursor over
what you want to remove (see Figure 21-4).
This kind of work is usually better done before
you do the mix. It should only be used to
remove audio (or awkward stretches of
silence) as a last resort.
Zoom in to make sure you can cut with preci-
sion, and play the audio you’ve highlighted
back by clicking the Play button to make sure
you’re only taking what you want to remove.
• Figure 21-4: Highlighting audio to snip out is more
accurate this way than with scissors.
Press Ô+X (Ctrl+X in Audition), and the audio is cut
and moved to the Clipboard (see Figure 21-5). If you
just want to delete the audio without possibly sav-
ing it for later, press the Delete key. As always,
remember the Undo command is available if you
need to go back on your changes.
• Figure 21-5: After the cut, the removed audio in the
Clipboard is ready to move or discard.

175
Moving sections around
Perhaps you wanted to move the phrase you just cut
to another section of the file. Choose the location you
want to move the audio to (as shown in Figure 21-6),
and press Ô+V (Ctrl+V in Audition).
• Figure 21-6: Finding where to put your cut audio phrase.
The audio will appear wherever you placed the cur-
sor, as shown in Figure 21-7. Again, remember to
zoom in and make the cuts as precise as possible.
• Figure 21-7: Inserting the new audio.
This function can be extremely helpful if you want to
move segments of your show around — or remove
entire sections entirely.
If you’re using bed music or any sort of back-
ground effects, make sure your cuts don’t
throw anything off the beat or make your
effects sound unnatural. If that’s impossible to
do in the original audio file, you may have to
go back to your original session and make
some edits there.
Erasing the silence
Depending on how you’ve put together your show,
you may have some silence at the beginning, the
middle, or the end of the file. This is basically
adding more data to the file (the computer has to
use more file space to tell the file to remain quiet),
and long pauses can be annoying to the listener if
they’re not an integral part of the show. It’s just as
easy to remove silence as audio, though. Just high-
light the section you want to remove — in this case,
at the end of the file, as shown in Figure 21-8.
• Figure 21-8: Highlighting the silence for discreet removal.

Practice 21: Editing Audio after Editing the Session
176
Then, either cut or delete the audio as you did
before. This will dramatically tighten up your pod-
cast (as shown in Figure 21-9) and make it seem
more professional. There’s very little that’s more
annoying than dead air (although infomercials do
spring to mind as a candidate for that honor).
• Figure 21-9: Removing the silence leaves more room for
content.

Taking Your Audio
File into the Home
Stretch
A
t this point, your podcast has been mixed, exported, and maybe
even cut and rearranged. Considering the care you’ve put into it
up until now, it also probably sounds pretty good. However, you
may want to go back and look at a few things. Think of this as the few
subtle brushstrokes and blends you perform before hanging your Mona
Lisa in the Louvre of the Internet. (And yes, that may be the first time the
Internet has been compared to an art museum. Okay, maybe not. But
what the heck, aim high.)
Listening with a New Ear
You’ve spent a lot of time with the file, and you’re hyperaware of every-
thing you’ve had to do to make your podcast sound good. It’s started to
sound so familiar that you can practically recite everything word for
word from memory. Still, it’s important to put all this aside and listen to
the podcast again — as if you’ve never heard it before.
Of course, barring access to a personal time machine, you can’t really do
that. It does help, however, to put some distance between yourself and
the episode to gain some perspective. Before you shotput your laptop,
we’re talking about mental distance — spending some time away from
the podcast. Go and take care of the other things in your life, and come
back to it in a few hours, or even the next day if you have the time (this is
one reason it’s a good idea to give yourself plenty of time before your
deadline). Come back and listen to the episode later, and you’ll notice
things you may not have noticed before. True, all the heavy lifting should
be done by now — but be prepared to alter the file a little bit if you
notice anything you need to change.
At some point, you have to turn the file loose and stop tweaking and
adjusting. There may be some things you’re never quite happy with
(say, the way your co-host breathes weirdly sometimes), but it’s not
something you can fix without having to put in hours and hours of
work. And it probably only bothers you, really. When it’s done, it’s
done. Let it go.

the file without disturbing the bed music or sound
effects), a limiter might be helpful. This plug-in
doesn’t raise the lower volume levels; it just stops
the louder sounds from exceeding a certain level.
Again, trust your users — use gentle settings on the
limiter. Set the threshold to affect just the highest
peaks in the audio, and let everything else go.
If you’ve managed the levels on your audio
and music well up to this point, you probably
won’t have to mess with this step. It’s better to
handle these kinds of things before you mix
than after. This should be a final option for
your audio.
Pump It Up
You don’t want your listeners turning off your pod-
cast because it sounds distorted and loud, but you
also don’t want them reaching for the speakers to
crank it up and then losing their eardrums when they
go on to a track at normal volume. It’s just not polite.
There are a couple of ways you can achieve the right
balance, and both Soundtrack and Audition provide
similar functions. Look at the menu in Soundtrack
Pro, as shown in Figure 22-1, to see what’s available.
• Figure 22-1: Volume options in Soundtrack Pro: 
Use with taste.
The Finishing Touches
The final project is probably the wrong time to start
adding most audio effects (reverb, delay, and the
like). Such johnny-come-lately additions can make the
audio unlistenable at worst, and they just don’t make
much sense at best. There are, however, a few func-
tions that could help you improve the sound with just
a few subtle tweaks. Even so, it’s best to leave major
audio surgery to earlier work with the session file and
not try to cram it into the final project.
Even out the sound with gentle
compression settings
We’ve already looked at compression several times
in this book — but it’s not always a good idea at this
stage, especially if you apply it too heavily. It can be
useful if you’re just evening out the levels a little in
the final file (say, speech levels that come across as
too low compared to the music) — although this is
also something that’s better handled in the mix
before you get to the final-episode stage. If you find
such subtle tweaks necessary, though, use a com-
pressor with a gentle setting (around a 2:1 ratio with
a high dB threshold setting); it could help even out
the sound of the file and raise the overall volume
a bit.
It may be tempting to use more extreme com-
pressor settings to raise the volume level of
the file to high levels. That’s because reducing
volume peaks and raising the lower volume
levels means you can make your files louder
without distortion. But resist. Audio engineers,
mixers, and other aficionados decry the loud-
ness of modern music as exhausting to the ear
(and terrible-sounding, to boot). Make sure the
file sounds good first; make sure it’s safely
loud — audible and clear — but don’t push it.
Controlling high peaks with a limiter
If you just want to squash some loud and transient
peaks of volume (and you can’t just cut them out of

One More Time, with Feeling
179
Normalization
This function, shown in Figure 22-2, analyzes the
overall volume of the file, gives you its findings, and
asks how you want to proceed. Remember that a
widely accepted convention of –6 dB is a good setting
for final audio files, so that’s a good place to start.
• Figure 22-2: Normalization gives you a look at your file’s
overall volume level.
Once you choose to process the file, the highest vol-
ume peak in the file will be raised to –6 dB, and all of
the other volume levels in that file will be raised by
the same ratio. It’s a good way to raise the level of
your file somewhat and still keep your file from clip-
ping and distorting.
Adjust Amplitude
This function, shown in Figure 22-3, is basically the
same thing as normalization, except you don’t get
the information about the file in the plug-in. Instead,
you get a volume slider and a read-out of the adjust-
ment. You can use this tool on the entire file, but it’s
probably better to select a portion of the file by
highlighting the section (using the mouse) and just
amplifying a section of the file.
• Figure 22-3: The Adjust Amplitude function is appropriate
for adjusting sections of the file.
One More Time, with Feeling
What, yet another listening? Yes, it’s time. After this,
you’ll convert the file to other formats, so this is the
last chance you’ll have to actively control the qual-
ity of your sound (programs that create mp3 or
other lossy formats don’t take user input too well,
really). You might as well make sure the file sounds
as good as possible before it goes that route. Listen

Creating a Perfect
mp3 File
L
ike a true artist or craftsman, you’ve analyzed, poked, prodded, and
nursed your master audio file into a perfect podcast episode. It
sounds fantastic, and you can’t wait to turn it loose on the masses
and bask in their approval. The problem is that your file is still an uncom-
pressed audio file — it hasn’t been modified or made smaller in any way.
All the data that was recorded is still in that file, and it carries quite a lot
of heft. These files are great for editing purposes, but they’re far too large
to post on your Web site or through your RSS feed. The Internet would
get bogged down, valuable birthday e-mails would be delayed, and some-
where a child would cry. Avoid that if at all possible.
That’s where compressed audio comes in. Even if you’ve never heard the
term compressed audio before, you know what it is. The most popular
example is the venerable mp3 format. Think of it like the tube that allows
you to fit a T-shirt into a smaller space and send it hurtling into the
stands at any major sporting event. You could adjust the size of the tube
for faster and easier flight, but you’ll also want to make sure you don’t
mangle the T-shirt inside.
The mp3 format also allows you to include a great deal of information
embedded directly into the file, including title, copyright, year of creation,
and more. (We look more closely at that information in Practice 25.)
Crunching the Numbers
All mp3 files are not created equal. You’ve probably heard this principle
in practice if you’ve listened to a lot of podcasts. Some files may sound
quite good, while others seem to have crawled forth from the sonic
space occupied by old AM radios and Edison wax cylinders. This quality
(or lack thereof) could be traced back to the audio-production skills (or
lack thereof) of the person who put together the podcast, but it might
also be the responsibility of the mp3 file settings. There are three main
characteristics that define an mp3 file, and their values help you deter-
mine the right mix of file size and sound quality.

Preaching to the Converted
181
Bit rate
The bit rate of the mp3 file determines how much
audio “information” is captured in the file. A higher
bit rate means you’ll capture more information, and
a lower bit rate means you’ll get less information (as
well as a flat, tinny sound with glitches and pops).
Think of it as the difference between a picture of a
black cat and a picture of a long-haired black cat
with green eyes lying on the floor of a decent-size
living room. The bit rate is measured in kilobits per
second (kbps) — the widely accepted rate for music
files is 128 kbps — although you can cheat a little
with a lower bit rate for podcasts that use only
spoken-word voices. (A good setting for that would
be 96 kbps.) For higher-quality music podcasts, you
might want to increase the bit rate, even though
doing so will result in a larger file. Bit rates can
range from 32 to 320 kbps.
Sample rate
If the bit rate is the amount of information in a pic-
ture, the sample rate is the amount of times a pic-
ture can be taken. The sample rate of an mp3 file is
measured in how many thousands of samples are
taken each second. Available rates include 32 kHz,
44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz. You’ll find most mp3 files at
44.1 because that’s the standard established for CD
audio; you can go higher or lower, depending on the
quality of audio you desire. A higher sample rate
means the file can include higher frequencies (44.1
kHz files can hold frequencies up to 22 kHz, which is
roughly the range of human hearing).
There’s a known bug in Flash-based players
that causes audio voices to sound like cartoon
chipmunks (think Alvin, Simon, and Theodore
to get the right idea) when using non-stan-
dard sampling rates. Stick to 44.1 kHz (or, fail-
ing that, to any multiple of 11) to keep that
from happening. You want to make sure your
audio can be heard by the greatest possible
number of people — and that means playing
nice with all kinds of programs.
Constant and variable bit rate
There are two ways to send audio information down
the pipeline:

A constant bit rate means that the bit rate stays
the same no matter what. Even if there’s three
seconds of total and utter silence in the file,
you’ll get that three seconds in all the glory that
file’s bit rate can provide. And at 320 kbps, that’s
a considerable amount of glory. 

A variable bit rate is a conversion process that
looks at the audio files, predicts where less infor-
mation (and smaller file size) is necessary, and
converts the file accordingly. That means you get
only the silence at a lower bit rate, but everything
else will come through in better quality. This
approach can save some file size here and there
and make the files sound better, but you might
run into hassles with incompatible players —
even (sometimes) the iPod.
Preaching to the Converted
It’s like finding a long-lost and extremely useful tool
during the otherwise-tedious cleaning of your base-
ment: More than likely you’ve already got a program
on your computer that can compress your audio
file. File compression is a built-in function for most
media players, and there are several free or low-cost
programs available for download that are built
specifically for file conversion. Some editing soft-
ware can save you a step (and some space on your
hard drive) by saving or converting your completed
audio folder inside the program.
Media players
Here’s where we take a look at the common media
players available to the public, just so you can
understand how easy file conversion can be. For
openers, just about every computer user has access
to iTunes — it’s a free program and easy to down-
load. Because most folks with computers use PCs
(sorry Mac fans, this is just quantity, not necessarily
quality), the Windows Media Player (currently on

start out saving files in their default formats (M4A

you want wherever you want.

it back.
Specific conversion programs
There are just too many programs available that can
convert files from any format to mp3 to consider
each one individually. They can use a variety of
methods to perform this conversion, although
quite a few use the LAME encoder (great program,
unfortunate name) to make the transition. This
encoder is available free of charge at http://lame.
sourceforge.net/.
Exporting your goods to an mp3 file
Programs like Adobe’s Audition and SoundBooth
and others can export your mix directly to an mp3
file, should you desire that bit of magic. This step

Practice 23: Creating a Perfect mp3 File

over mp3. It can also add the images and bookmarks
that AAC offers, but Windows Media Player doesn’t
allow these scripts to run by default. It’s still possi-
ble to run them, but if some of your listeners don’t
know how to enable scripts in WMP, they’re in for a
bit of a hassle.
Switching back and forth between formats
Imagine that you are making a series of copies of a
painting. If you’re using the original of that painting,
the copies you make will probably look pretty good.
If you start copying the copies, though, you’ll notice
the picture degrading. Pretty soon, you’re left with
shapeless lumps that look more like abstract art
than the Mona Lisa you started with.
Starting with an uncompressed file format and then
compressing it ensures that you get the most quality
at the smallest possible file size. If you go from one
compressed file to another, though, you’ll notice that
things start sounding worse. Remember that mp3,
AAC, and WMA files (among others) are lossy com-
pression schemes — information is lost in the con-
version process. It’s information that the coders
believe you won’t miss, but it’s gone nonetheless.
Start trying to make copies from incomplete sources,
and you’ll see where this is going. That’s why it’s
always better to start with an uncompressed file.
There are several lossless compression schemes
available, including proprietary Apple and Microsoft
formats along with the open-source FLAC (Free
Lossless Audio Codec) format. These give you
smaller files sizes without losing any information,
but they’re still usually too large to send down the
podcast pipeline.
essentially allows you to skip the creation of a mas-
ter file and go directly to your final product. It does
save time, but it takes away some of the mastering
and customizing options detailed in Practice 22. You
have to have a lot of confidence in your mixing skills
to take this step.
Examining Other Formats
Creating an mp3 file isn’t the only way to compress
audio, although it’s probably the most universally
accepted. That’s why it’s so commonly used for pod-
casts — you can be reasonably sure that everybody
who downloads it will be able to use it. If you’re going
for the widest audience, mp3 is probably the way to
go. If, however, you have a specific audience in mind
and want to add some capabilities to your podcast,
you may want to consider a different format.
AAC
This format was popularized by Apple and is used
as the default setting for the iPod and the iTunes
Store. It can be played on both PC and Mac, but not
many media players outside of the iTunes program
will play these files. Using the AAC format will give
you better sound quality — at lower bit rates —
than mp3, and it can also contain embedded photos
and bookmarks to give the listener more control
over the podcast.
WMA
WMA is the preferred format for Windows Media
Player, and it also offers quality and bit-rate savings

Enhanced
Podcasting
I
n the summer of 2006, a new kind of podcasting introduced itself to the
podosphere. This new approach to podcasting breaks the “fourth wall”
(non-existent in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off), bringing the audience into the
action by offering images, links, and some ways and means of becoming
part of the podcast. Because this podcast offered features beyond those
found in standard audio productions, creators deemed this kind of pod-
cast as enhanced.
While an enhanced podcast appears very slick and complicated on the
outside, it’s actually a lot of fun and very easy to create. In this practice,
you find out all the details behind an enhanced podcast, helping you
understand what you have created, what it can (and cannot) play back
on, and how to promote this kind of podcast.
What Is an Enhanced Podcast?
With enhanced podcasts, the audience members are no longer spectators
but active participants in the episode. They can click individual images
for a closer look, follow hyperlinks to additional resources cited in the
episode, and even hop back and forth to the beginning of a section in the
podcast, as if they were surfing a DVD for a specific moment in a film. 
Enhanced podcasts can feature

E-mail links
As you already know, traditional podcasts consist of mp3 files automati-
cally distributed to a list of subscribers via an RSS feed. So what happens
when you “enhance” a podcast? Well, the good news is that the feed itself
does not change. The iTunes tags stay the same; ID3 tags are still very
much the norm.

(www.jakeludington.com/project_
studio/20051004_windows_media_
enhanced_podcast.html) offers a lesson
(complete with screen shots and reference
links) on how to create enhanced podcasts
using Windows Media. If you use Windows,
you can give this lesson a go. Alas, the soft-
ware options are Mac-only.

Your audience loses the ability to multitask or
work on something else while listening to your
enhanced podcast. In the same vein as a video
podcast (covered in Part VI), subscribers to the
enhanced podcast will want to pay close atten-
tion to their iPods or iTunes to take in every-
thing you’re offering them. Listeners must focus
all their time and attention on the imagery and
possible reference links. The “captive audience”
factor, at least in this case, may deter listeners
from subscribing to your podcast.
While Macs make it easier to create enhanced
podcasts, the process can be an issue in
GarageBand. When you launch GarageBand,
you have a choice of what media to produce,
as shown in Figure 24-1. Selecting the New
Podcast Episode option may seem like a 
no-brainer, but the documentation (and the
books available on enhanced podcasting) fails
to mention a significant little detail: By making
this selection, you have committed to creating
a M4A file and not a simple AIFF file that can
be exported in iTunes as an mp3. GarageBand,
by default, assumes you want to create
enhanced podcasts. The best way to avoid
hopping in and out of Preferences is to select
the New Music Project option for standard
podcasts and New Podcast Episode for your
enhanced episodes.
The media file itself, though, changes dramatically.
Instead of creating an mp3 file, you create an M4A
file. This format is slightly different from the typical
mp3 compression, designed to provide lossless
encoding using less file space. This audio compres-
sion also allows for image compression and some
HTML coding, putting even more distance between
it and mp3. 
Enhancements with a Cost
There’s no denying that enhanced podcasting is
very, very cool. It is also very, very easy to do . . . for
Mac users. You can still make enhanced podcasts on
Windows; but for ease and simplicity, the Mac OS is
in the forefront in creating enhanced podcasts (as
you find out later on in this practice).
The enhanced podcast truly merits its name; it
allows a stronger connection between the podcast
host and audience. In effect, you have a captive audi-
ence awaiting your instructions and watching iTunes
or their iPods for the next image or hyperlink.
With that said, already a few downsides of working
with enhanced podcasts become evident:

Enhanced podcasts play back only on iTunes
(for the desktop computer) and iPods (portable
players). Although the operating system doesn’t
matter to a podcast, the playback device does.
When it comes to enhanced podcasts, only
iTunes and iPods serve as playback devices.
Your audience can listen to your podcasts only if
they have access to iTunes/iPod technology.
According to some statistical programs, over
70 percent of podcast audience members listen
to podcasts using iTunes — which means you’re
excluding about 30 percent of your potential
listenership. Are you sure you want to do that?

Enhanced podcasts can be tricky for Windows
users to create. With a Macintosh, creating an
enhanced podcast is simply an issue of dragging

Reasons Why You May Want to Enhance a Podcast
187
• Figure 24-1: GarageBand 3 offers several options for
recording and scoring, but just because you
want to record a podcast doesn’t mean
you’ll want to use the Podcast option.
Before launching your podcast and taking full advan-
tage of the possibilities that come with enhanced
podcasting, take a look at the pros and cons in this
approach. True, an enhanced podcast is dynamic
and engaging, but are you trying to reach people in
a multitasking environment, or are you out to keep
your audience’s eyes (or should we say “i’s”?) glued
to their iPods, iTunes, and now iPhones? (Ay-yi-yi!)
So long as you’re aware of the trade-off and the avail-
able compromise with enhanced podcasting, you can
decide whether enhanced podcasting is for you.
Reasons Why You May Want
to Enhance a Podcast
You have a new level of podcasting to explore, a way
of making a tactile (well, through the mouse, any-
way) connection with your listenership. Keeping in
mind that enhancing your podcast may limit your
audience to iTunes and iPod users, you may still
have some compelling reasons that make up for the
reduced audience size.
So the question remains: Why would you even want
to enhance a podcast? Well, for openers . . . 
On-the-job training
For podcasts in the corporate, not-for-profit, and
government sectors, enhanced podcasting is a fan-
tastic way to associate images and hyperlinks with
audio training sessions. Instead of working just with
commentary, you can showcase specific images in
the podcast, displaying how Widget A fits with
Socket B. Subscribers can also pause the podcast on
images and diagrams for prolonged looks, and if
they need more information, they can e-mail the
contact at the link provided or go straight from the
podcast to the Web site.
Education
Duke University is now requiring iPods for specific
classes in order to bring lectures and additional
classroom material into the semester’s curriculum.
With enhanced podcasting, visual aids, additional
URLs (approved by the professor), and e-mail con-
tacts can be provided. Duke’s Continuing Education
podcasts — such as the K9cast with Tara and Walter
(www.k9cast.com) — offer specific topics for col-
lege graduates and take advantage of enhanced
podcasting features, such as images of proper pro-
cedures, hyperlinks to other noted resources, and
e-mail contacts — all approved by the professors.
Soundseeing tours with visuals
Tim Burgess of Kyoto Podcast (http://homepage.
mac.com/japanpodguides/) was an early adopter
of the enhanced podcast. His soundseeing tour of
Kyoto, Japan, went one step further, offering listen-
ers informative links and breathtaking images of the
Land of the Rising Sun.
Other soundseeing podcasts have posted special
editions that feature accompanying images to their
captured moments of culture. Whether you decide
to do your entire soundseeing tour as an enhanced
podcast or simply post special editions, enhanced
podcasting can bring your listeners into a truer,
more complete virtual visit to where you are in the
world.

anyway). You may have to put some time into post-
ing show notes, but even that can be easily managed. 
Here are a few tips for running both an enhanced
and a standard mp3 podcast:

Produce the audio-only version first. Record
and edit your audio first. As a general rule, try to
avoid (if you can) directly referring to images
and links in the audio. By keeping your audio
independent of the imagery and the link you’ll
be using in an enhanced version, your mp3 can
stand alone. The mp3 can then be easily con-
verted (complete with URLs and images) into an
enhanced version.

Produce show notes for the audio-only version
first. Similar to the media file, you can produce
the detailed show notes that include links to var-
ious resources mentioned in the podcast. After
you’ve got your show notes proofed, all linked
up, and ready to go, simply copy and paste your
show notes into the enhanced podcast’s host
blog. Result: The show’s content has not
changed from the standard to enhanced version,
and the links are included in the show notes as
an extra courtesy. 

While planning your podcast’s next episode,
collect images and links for the enhanced ver-
sion. You’ll have to do some pre-production
work, compiling show notes, looking over links
to reference for your next podcast, and even get-
ting images you might want to showcase on the
host blog. This is the time to compile images,
resize them, and get them ready for your
enhanced version. You can also compile e-mail
addresses and URLs, and double-check them
before recording to make sure the Web sites and
contacts are still valid. Then when your audio-
only version of the podcast is ready, just drag
and drop your new images into place for the
enhanced podcast.
The main reason to maintain both feeds is maximum
coverage. While the standard podcast gives you the
widest listenership, an enhanced podcast offers a
new level of participation for your subscribers.
Seminars and guest symposiums
Provided you get permission from the speakers at a
conference or symposium, podcasting a presentation
with the accompanying slides can be a real boon to
your subscribers. On cue, in the enhanced podcast,
images progress with the audio, making it possible
for anyone who missed the talk to attend virtually.
Those participating in this recorded seminar also
benefit by going back and reviewing the presentation,
pausing at specific slides for any details they might
have missed the first time around. For the speakers
themselves, their talks can be reviewed with the
slides, making enhanced podcasting an excellent tool
for improving the flow of presentations.
Product reviews
As featured on Adam Christensen’s MacCast
(http://maccast.com), users (and Adam himself)
will reference many products and links throughout
the show. In the enhanced version of the podcast,
Adam also features an image of the product, pod-
cast, or Mac-centric accessory so listeners can see
what the user’s review is talking about and know
specifically what to look for when shopping for it. 
Maintaining Two Feeds to
Reach a Wider Audience
The previous section gives several valid reasons to
try out — or, if you’re sold on it, commit to — the
enhanced podcast approach. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that reaching the widest audience possible
with an enhanced podcast may require you to make
a compromise:
Create two feeds.
It may sound complicated and perhaps a bit time-
consuming, but maintaining a second feed for the
same podcast is actually fairly easy (compared to
the production time required for the podcast itself,

A good idea from the SciFi Channel
The SciFi Channel has offered a variety of science fiction
programming over the years, but recently an unassuming
show with boatloads of charm and wit has come on the
scene, and now this “small town with big secrets” steps into
the podosphere with its own official podcast.
Colin Ferguson (Sheriff Jack Carter) is host of The Eureka
Podcast (http://scifi.com/eureka/downloads/
podcast/), a behind-the-scenes look at SciFi’s popular
comedy, Eureka. Each episode is a candid moment with
the actor’s opinions and perspectives on a particular
episode. He also invites guests to chime in, the additional
voices ranging from creators Andrew Crosby and Jamie
Paglia to fellow actors like Ed Quinn (Nathan Stark) and
Jordan Hinson (Zoe Carter). 
The Eureka Podcast offers more than just audio. With the
enhanced version, accompanying images of scenes and
characters appear as they are discussed. These little
touches help the audience see what the actors, writers, and
producers are talking about; or provide reminders of what
specific scenes are being referred to. Other times, the
images serve as chapter markers, allowing you to skip back
or ahead between commercial breaks, making it easier to
keep pace with the commentary as you watch the show.
In the same vein as Battlestar Galactica, Eureka provides an
intimate link between artists and audience. The podcast is a
lot of fun to listen to, either with the show or on its own.
The Eureka Enhanced Podcast is definitely affirmation that
while Sheriff Carter may not be the sharpest tool in this
small-town shed, he’s definitely the coolest. Why? He’s
hosting his own podcast.
Hosting two feeds may split your statistics in two,
but you don’t need higher math skills to add those
numbers together later for a total count. Some audi-
ence members may even listen to both (say, when
the audio-only piques their curiosity to check out
the visuals).
Try special enhanced editions first if you’re
unsure about enhanced podcasts. If your lis-
teners like what they hear and see, launch an
independent enhanced feed and see what
happens.

in GarageBand 3
Upon launching GarageBand 3 (www.apple.com/
garageband), Mac users are greeted with several
options (see Figure 24-2) that show what this com-
ponent of iLife has to offer. 
After you click Create New Podcast, GarageBand cre-
ates an interface with the following tracks already in
place:

Podcast Track: Here is where you drag in images
and establish markers for your podcast.

Male Voice: This is a basic vocal track (created
from the Real Instrument settings of GarageBand)
and optimized for the average male voice.

Female Voice: Same as above, only optimized for
the average female voice.

Jingles: This track has presets for the already
prepared, mixed, and ready-to-play looped jin-
gles (short pieces of music) included with
GarageBand.

Radio Sounds: This final track is optimized for
sound effects and a feature called musical typing,
where GarageBand turns your alphanumeric key-
board into a sound effects machine, playing
drop-in audio bytes provided by the application.

Prep work for the enhanced podcast
Before you can start creating the enhanced podcast,
you need to gather your resources, including your
images and audio files. As explained earlier, this is a
Mac-centric process; you’ll need to be using (well,
yeah) a Macintosh. You’ll also need the Expert
Podcasting Practices For Dummies DVD, iPhoto, and
iTunes at the ready.
For this practice, you will focus on creating an
enhanced podcast using the Podcast, Male Voice,
and Jingles tracks. You can find out more about the
rest of the features in GarageBand For Dummies by
Bob LeVitus (Wiley).

In the following steps, you gather the media you’re
going to use for your enhanced podcast:
1.
Copy the Practice 24 folder from the DVD onto
your Macintosh.
2.
Open iPhoto.
3.
Choose File➪Import to Library (Shift+Ú+I) and
import the following files from the Images
directory:
 00-episode.jpg
 01.jpg
 02.jpg
 03.jpg
 04.jpg
 05.jpg
 06.jpg
You’ll use these seven images for the chapter
markers that you’ll create a little later in this
practice. 
4.
Choose File➪New Album (Ú+N) and create a
new album called EPP For Dummies.
5.
Select the seven images you just imported
into iPhoto and drag them into the EPP For
Dummies album.
6.
Launch iTunes.
7.
Choose File➪Add to Library (Ú+O) and import
P24-audio.aif and enhanced-audio.mp3
from the Practice 24 directory.
These files are your audio, both music and voice,
that you will drop images and links around and
build your podcast on.
8.
With the new audio files selected, choose
File➪New Playlist from Selection (Shift+Ú+N)
and name the new playlist Podcast Files. 
Now that you have what you need for this podcast,
you’re ready to put it all together.
Building the basic podcast
With the resources you need at the ready, follow
these steps to use GarageBand to create the podcast:
1.
Launch GarageBand and select the Create New
Podcast option.
2.
After the interface appears, click the Jingles
track.
You’re going to drop in music for your podcast’s
theme in this track.
3.
Click the View/Hide the Loop Browser but-
ton (refer to Figure 24-2) to turn the Loop
Browser on.
The Loop Browser window allows you to scroll
through all the different fully mixed, fully
orchestrated jingles and suites that GarageBand
3 offers. Some are labeled “short,” setting them
at around 10 to 15 seconds, while the “long” ver-
sions run past the 1-minute mark.
4.
In the Loop Browser window (currently on the
default setting of Jingles➪All), find the song
marked “Gelato” and click it. 
GarageBand plays the song for you before you
drop it into the project. We’re suggesting
“Gelato” because it’s a fun ditty for this podcast.
5.
Click “Gelato” again to stop this preview. Then
click and drag “Gelato” to your Jingles track.
6.
Check to see whether the Media Browser is in
view. Click the View/Hide Media Browser but-
ton (refer to Figure 24-2) to view your media
elements in the Media Browser window, shown
in Figure 24-3. 
The Media Browser appears blue when active.
7.
Click the Media Browser tab for Audio. Expand
iTunes and then click the Podcast Files playlist. 
You see P24-audio in your Media Browser.
8.
Click and drag P24-audio into the Male Voice
Track. Place it at the beginning of the track.

step-saver, it lacks subtlety. In the next few
steps, you’ll be setting levels manually (with a
lot more nuance). 
11.
Click the Show Volume Track or Pan Curve
option (the small triangle in the track options)
to expand the Track Volume. 
In the following steps, you’ll be creating control
points along the Track Volume Level. These
points act much like the control points created
in Soundtrack Pro and Audition, allowing you
to change the volume of the music. Unlike the
Ducking feature, control points give you full con-
trol over levels. From here to Step 19, the steps
guide you through mixing audio and voice in
GarageBand using control points. 
12.
Move your playhead to 00:00:02.000 in the
timeline and click at the intersection between
the volume level and the edit line.
This operation creates a control point.
13.
Using the right-arrow key on your keyboard,
advance to 00:00:05.000; then click at the inter-
section between the volume level and the
edit line.
Doing so creates another control point so you
can set the volume of your music. 
14.
Click and drag the new control point down to
–22.9 dB, as shown in Figure 24-4.
For this particular piece, this dB level makes the
music soft enough to still be heard without over-
powering the voice.
15.
Click and drag the audio in the Male Vocals
track toward the right. Time the vocals to start
after the fade down of music.
By moving the audio in the Male Vocals track to
the right, the voice starts closer to the end of the
fade-out in music. 
16.
Click the Podcast Track and then click the
View/Hide Track Editor button (the scissors
icon) in GarageBand. 
Clicking this button opens the interface needed
for incorporating images.
9.
Preview the track.
Press the spacebar or the Play button to preview
it. Press the spacebar or Play button again to
stop.

Save your project.
The basics of your podcast are in place. Now, with
just a few clicks and drags, you’re going to turn this
podcast into an enhanced podcast.
Enhancing the podcast with images
The foundations of your podcast are established.
You have the audio and the mood-setting theme in
place, along with professional fade-ins and fade-
outs. You even have the show logo in place.
Now you’re ready to enhance the podcast with
images. Follow these steps:
1.
Click the Podcast Track and listen for the
break between “ . . . talking about enhanced
podcasting” and “But since we have taken. . . .”
Click and drag the image marked 01 from the
Media Browser into the Podcast Track where
the playhead resides, as shown in Figure 24-5.
You have just added your first image (for
Chapter 1) to the podcast. Now when users lis-
ten to the host suggest that a review of the pod-
casting process is in order, an image of how
podcasting happens appears on-screen. 
When selecting images for your enhanced pod-
cast, try to choose relevant images for what you
or you and your guest are talking about. The more
relevant and helpful the image, the more you are
taking advantage of the enhanced podcast.
Another way to add an image to your
enhanced podcast is to click and drag the
image marked 01 from the Media Browser
into the Podcast Track Editor window.

The Podcasting Process.
Although it’s called a “chapter title,” this label
can be anything you want it to be. A caption for
the image works well here.

The images you’re working with are taken
from a presentation concerning podcasting.
Because of the screen resolution of the pres-
entation, the graphics are 1024×768. These
images work fine, but larger images bulk up
your enhanced podcast and make it unneces-
sarily large. When creating graphics — either
for your podcast’s primary graphic or for your
enhanced podcast — follow these specs, which
are perfect for podcasting:
72-ppi resolution
JPEG format
300-pixel width by 300-pixel height
As you review your podcast, watch how it plays
back with each image appearing and changing on
cue, ending with the Episode Graphic (the
Podcasting For Dummies Podcast artwork). 
Adding final touches to your enhanced podcast
You have given your audience something to look at.
Now you need to give ’em somewhere to go from
your podcast. Follow these steps:
1.
With the Podcast Track still active, go to the
editor window and double-click the chapter
marker (yellow diamond) next to the time code
for the More Information on Tee Morris
slide. 
In your timeline, you hop directly to that point.
2.
Scroll horizontally to where you see the
grayed-out sections for URL Title and URL,
as shown in Figure 24-6.
• Figure 24-6: Scroll to the right in the editor window to
find fields where you can enter URL titles
and links.
3.
Click URL Title and type in The Official
Website of Tee Morris.
4.
Click URL and type in www.teemorris.com. 
GarageBand will add in the http:// for you.
5.
Scroll horizontally in the editor window and
double-click the chapter marker next to the
time code for the Contact Tee slide. 
6.
Scroll to where you see the grayed-out URL
Title and URL. Click URL Title and type in
E-mail Tee.
7.
Click URL and type in mailto:tee@
teemorris.com, as shown in Figure 24-7. 
GarageBand won’t add the http:// here; that’s
because you’re hard-coding (typing in) the
mailto link.
• Figure 24-7: When you drop in a URL or e-mail link, the
link appears at the bottom of the graphic to
indicate an active link for this slide. 
You have now incorporated e-mail and hyperlinks
into your presentation. These links are active and
can be tested in GarageBand by previewing the fin-
ished episode in the Podcast Preview window.
You may notice in the preview, however, that some
of the images are cropped too tightly. Follow these
steps to remedy that situation:

you should leave the Displays URL active.
Creating Enhanced Podcasts
in Podcast Maker
Podcast Maker (www.lemonzdream.com/podcast
maker/) from Lemonz Dream is similar to
GarageBand in that enhanced podcasting is a
simple process of dragging and dropping images.
This independent Mac application also offers an
RSS Feed Generator and seamless interaction with
.Mac and FTP client programs. 
This application, however, does not allow for audio
editing. You’ll have to import a completely edited
audio file into Podcast Maker before you can
enhance it. Podcast Maker isn’t a standalone appli-
cation for recording and editing — but it is a terrific
tool for turning any audio file into a podcast (hence
its name). 
Similar to GarageBand 3, Podcast Maker pulls media
from iPhoto and iTunes. Additionally, it pulls book-
marked links from Safari — and only from Safari —
making this application (believe it or not) even more
Mac-centric than GarageBand.

Creating chapters and adding images
Next, follow these steps to add artwork to the podcast:
1.
Click the Chapters button in the lower-right
corner of the window and then select the
Enhanced Podcast check box.
The Artwork and Chapters window appears, as
shown in Figure 24-12. 
2.
To create the first break, click the Play button
and listen for the break between “ . . . talking
about enhanced podcasting” and “But since we
have taken. . . . “
You can also click and drag the playhead (the
black line in Podcast Maker’s timeline ruler)
back and forth to find the break. (The break is
approximately at 0:00:17.5 in the timeline.
Reference the time code located above and to
the left of the timeline ruler.) 
3.
From the Media window, select the Photos
icon; then click and drag the Preview slider
(located at the bottom of the Media window) to
the left until your slides form a single column.
The slides should be easy to see, as shown in
Figure 24-13.
5.
If you want to give this episode an Explicit tag
of Clean or No, select the appropriate option
from the Explicit drop-down menu.
Some podcasts individually tag episodes as
either Clean or No (the latter option leaving
the episode untagged), flagging only certain
episodes as Explicit. When tagging your
episodes, be honest. Directories reserve the
right to yank your show out of their database
if you misrepresent the show’s content.
6.
Click the Edit Podcast button located at the top
of the Podcast Maker interface. 
7.
Enter the information that you want to appear
on the iTunes page for your podcast. 
For this example, please type the following

Podcast Maker will want to publish your pod-
cast and feed straightaway, making the
episode live immediately. This may be a time-
saver, but nothing beats previewing your
work first before you make it a live podcast
episode. Listen for any missed cues, bungles,
or fluffs in your audio, double-check your ID3

they should be and that links take viewers
where you want them to go. Bottom line:
Although the automatic FTP and Publish capa-
bilities are great shortcuts that Podcast Maker
offers, they may not be the best way to go
for you.

Creating and
Editing ID3 Tags
I
f you attended primary school in the States, you probably encountered
your first truly draconian teacher somewhere around the third grade.
She may have been some gnarled woman with a beehive hairdo and
horn-rimmed glasses who demanded that all assignments be complete
with your name written in the upper-left-hand corner of the page, 
followed by the date and perhaps even subject. For kickers, you also
had to include the class period and perhaps even the number of your
seating assignment. To make matters worse, if you neglected to complete
any one of these descriptors on a paper, you ran the risk of having the
paper returned to you, a reduction in your overall score, or possibly even
getting a zero on the whole thing. Yes, just because you left off the date
or used your nickname.
Mrs. Crabtree (substitute any name here) didn’t do this because she was
a horrid person. No, she required this of you — and every student — so
she could easily identify the papers by student, assignment, subject, and
period. While you were off to attempt your mastery of the teeter-totter at
recess, Mrs. Crabtree was busy sifting through the homework and class-
work of 350 other students, and the only way she could do this with any
sort of efficiency was to require this descriptive data on each and every
paper, test, or project. (Just imagine how cranky she would have been
without it. . . .)
Nostalgia aside, we certainly hope some of that experience was ingrained
into your behavior patterns — because mp3 tags have an identification
schema that serves almost the exact same purpose. In this practice, we
describe a system of tagging inherent to mp3 files called ID3 tags. Proper
tagging of files ensures that any listener or consumer of the mp3 file
knows what it is, where it came from, and where it belongs. It’s an ele-
gantly simple system to use that is, quite frankly, overlooked (or consid-
ered superfluous) by many — but it can help stave off podcasting chaos.
The Miracle of ID3 Tags
As a podcaster, you should already be familiar with ID3 tags; it’s likely
you’ve been using them since your very first episode. We’re using words

Practice 25: Creating and Editing ID3 Tags

• Figure 25-1: Placement and layout of ID3v1 and ID3v2
tags inside of audio files.
Why they matter
Applications call upon ID3 tags to display descrip-
tive information to the end user — presumably a
human being listening to a file on an mp3 player
such as an iPod. ID3 tags are, by and large, what
causes the name of the audio file, podcast episode,
date, and image to appear on the screen as the show
is playing. And it’s not just iPods; almost all mp3
players utilize ID3 data to display information as the
file is playing.
Beyond serving the immediate needs of the listener,
ID3 tags are also used by applications in a variety of
ways. iTunes, the most widely used application to
receive podcast episodes, makes extensive use of
ID3 tags to help group things together and to sort
them for later play. Music databases, such as CDDB
(www.cddb.com) and FreeDB (www.freedb.org),
rely heavily on ID3 tags. Though not often used, ID3
tags can also be used to automatically link audio
files to various Web sites.
like should and likely because it’s obvious that not
every podcaster is paying very close attention to
these data — and that’s a little frustrating. If you
happen to be one of those people who never use ID3
tags, hear our plea: You’ll help us — and every one
of your listeners — if you make a commitment to
getting a good ID3 tagging system in place.
What they do
ID3 tags are metadata, which is extra data that
describes — and is stored with — the primary data
in your mp3 file. (Don’t you just love it when por-
tions of the word are used in the definition? How
handy.) Let’s try and break that down.
An mp3 file is a digital audio file. At the base level,
digital audio is a whole bunch of ones and zeros, just
like everything else in the digital world — in other
words, data. Run it through the right translator (an
mp3 player), and that data comes out as understand-
able information — in this case, audio. But while it’s
inside the machine, it’s data nonetheless.
Beyond the ones and zeros that make up the audio
portion of an mp3 file are additional data that
describe the contents, origin, and other aspects of
the audio file. Although they are contained within
the file, they don’t have any impact on the audio
portion of the file. They exist simply to report to
other applications that are designed to read them.
In effect, they practice a strict vow of speaking only
when asked a direct question.
There are actually two versions of ID3 tags: ID3v1
and ID3v2. In fact, each of these versions has a vari-
ety of sub-versions (okay, variants — they’re not all
that subversive), but that’s only important if you’re
developing applications that make use of ID3 tags.
Figure 25-1 shows you a representation of where the
two versions of ID3 tags are placed inside the audio
file. If that fascinates you and you want a deeper
dive, visit www.id3.org and geek out to your heart’s
content.

Tagging the Files and Editing the Tags
207
All these applications, from user interaction to pro-
gram function, require that you — the creator of the
mp3 file — properly fill out the ID3 tags on your file
every time. When you get right down to it, ID3 tags
make it easy for others to figure out where the file
came from when they get curious. Besides, don’t
you want more traffic to your site? Don’t you want
more feedback from listeners? Don’t you want more
subscribers? Fill out your ID3 tags. It’ll help.
Tagging the Files and Editing
the Tags
The process of properly tagging your mp3 files is
quite simple. In fact, the application you’re using to
create or manage your mp3 files probably provides
you with the option to complete many of the tags.
While almost all audio-editing applications pro-
vide an interface to your mp3 file, they don’t
always allow maximum flexibility for your tags.
You may need to use a different application to
get the most out of your tagging.
iTunes remains the largest tool for managing
podcasts — for listeners and podcasters alike. It’s
also among the easier applications to edit ID3 tags
with. Figure 25-2 shows the editing screen for ID3
tags found in one of two ways:

On a Mac: Press the Ô + I keyboard shortcut.

On a PC: Select an mp3 file and then choose
File➪Get Info.
If you’re looking for the most flexibility possible,
you’ll probably want to invest in a dedicated ID3
editing application. The price tag is usually around
$20 to $30 — and many podcasters will happily fork
over this small outlay for some added convenience.
ID3X (www.three-2-one.com/id3x) for the
Macintosh system is one of those tools; its editing
interface is displayed in Figure 25-3.
• Figure 25-2: iTunes allows you to edit some, but not all,
of the ID3 tags quickly and easily.
• Figure 25-3: ID3X is a full-featured ID3 tag-editing
application.

Practice 25: Creating and Editing ID3 Tags
208
Resist the temptation to use special characters
(such as an * or ~) at the front of your show
name. Yes, these tricks may cause your show
to have a higher alphabetical listing than it
would normally, but they also make it very
hard for your listeners to find your content.
They are already subscribed, so you don’t
need to find ways to trick them into listening
to you first. 
Artist
The Artist field displays the name of the host or
podcast crew responsible for the episode. Much like
the Album field, this tag should remain constant
throughout your show’s lifetime. Apple’s iTunes
system uses the Artist tag for grouping files together
in the directory structure. Changing the contents of
the Artist field will (again) cause your content to be
scattered around a listener’s system.
The contents of this field need not be the full and
legal names of your hosts. If Fred Flintstone and
Barney Rubble are the hosts, the phrase Fred &
Barney may be simpler to use and easier on every-
one. However, you should use this method of trunca-
tion only if the same diminutives are used on the
show. Why hide from your audience?
In addition, don’t feel obligated to list the entire
crew in this field, or to add in special guests. (The
Comment field may be more appropriate for that
information.) Bottom line: Keeping this field short
and consistent saves you from scattering your
content around.
Comment
This field is accessible by many mp3 players and is
best used to provide portable extra information
about the show. Where other fields are designed to
be short and sweet, you can get rather lengthy in
this field without issues. Some podcasters choose to
insert their entire show notes for a particular
episode in this field.
The Essential Tags
All of this is great stuff, and you need to do it.
But please DO NOT skip the last part of this
practice where we discuss the monkey wrench
that using iTunes as a podcatcher will intro-
duce to your well-thought-out plans. And no
reading ahead!
There are quite a few ID3 tags available, though
most podcasters (and most applications, for that
matter) use only a handful of them. (Your mileage
may vary.) The next few sections form a list, in
alphabetical order, of the essential tags you should
use to describe and identify your mp3 files — every
time.
ID3 tags were designed for describing music
files, so some of them may not make obvious
sense when you’re adding them to your file.
Bear with us; the podcast listening devices
make use of the tags we’re suggesting
you use.
Album 
This piece of information is the primary anchor
of your show. It appears on most mp3 players’
screens — and should be relatively consistent from
episode to episode. Ideally, it never changes unless
the title of your show changes. If your show is called
Today in iPhone, then that’s what you put in the
Album field of the file. Keep in mind that some play-
ers, like the hugely popular iPod, will use the Album
tag to group episodes together in the player. If you
change the name of your Album from episode to
episode, your files become harder for your listeners
to find.
You can use as many characters as you like in the
Album field, but anything longer than 30 characters
(including spaces) may get truncated on the display
screens of portable mp3 players. 

The Essential Tags
209
At a minimum, the Comments field should contain
the URL of your podcast. We highly recommend
including your copyright statement — Creative
Commons or otherwise — as well. This reduces the
chance of anyone misinterpreting the rights you’ve
assigned to the file.
Genre
The Genre field was designed to allow applications
to group types of music files together — keeping all
the Jazz tracks together, for example. As you look
through your mp3 player or editing software, you’ll
find legions of possible genres to use. You may be
tempted to look for a genre choice that’s appropri-
ate to the content of your show — but we recom-
mend that you take a different route: 
Unless you have a well-thought-out reason to do
otherwise, always set the genre to Podcast.
Yes, we realize that your show may consist of in-
depth interviews with the masters of jazz. But that
doesn’t mean your audience wants to hear you talk
between tracks of Miles Davis and The Scat Man.
And no, your listeners really don’t want to have
your program show up in their Trance mix.
For now, podcasts are podcasts, and the listening
experience is — by and large — much different from
that of listening to spoken word, audio books, and
the like. Someday we may find a better way to clas-
sify the types of podcasts we’re producing. For now,
Conventional Wisdom dictates that we all identify
the genre of our files as Podcast.
Using the term Podcast in your genre
assumes you’re working with ID3v2 tags, and
not the older (and more restrictive) ID3v1
tags. There aren’t any incompatibility issues,
but you may find that some applications —
like Audacity — continue to use the strict list
of genres allowed in ID3v1. If you use a dedi-
cated ID3-tagging application (or even
iTunes), you can easily get around this little
obstacle.
Name
This is the spot for the title of your specific episode.
It can and in fact should be different each and every
time you put up a new show file. The contents of
that field are up to you, though you should come up
with a formula or convention for naming your files.
In fact, it’s probably more important to stick with a
consistent Name convention than it is to concern
yourself with any other ID3 tag. While the pod-
catcher or mp3 player of choice for your listeners
will attempt to arrange content in a predefined fash-
ion, many listeners create their own playlists and
rely on the Name field almost exclusively to figure
out who you are and what you’re talking about.
Consider also that your listeners may grab many of
your previous shows all at once and add them to
their players. If your shows follow any sort of
sequence (for example, referencing things in past or
future shows), make sure your naming convention
allows your listeners to figure out (easily!) in what
order they should listen to your shows.
Many podcasters have come up with many different
conventions to use. And while we’re not so bold as
to assume we know the One True Way, we did write
the book around the assumption that you wouldn’t
mind having us tell you what to do if it works. We’re
all too happy to oblige. With that, we recommend
that your Name tags follow this convention:
Show ID > Sequential ID > Episode
Title > Stuff
Allow us to explain . . .
Show ID
As discussed earlier, you’ll be including the name of
your show in the Album field, so it may seem strange
to include it again. First, the Show ID need not be the
complete name of your program; that works best in
the Album field. Instead, the Show ID is an abbrevi-
ated version of your show name, usually done with
initials. If your title is Today in Sports Marketing, you
could simply use TiSM as your identifier.

Practice 25: Creating and Editing ID3 Tags
210
Stuff
Stuff is a sort of catch-all for the extra metadata you
want to share with your audience by tucking it into
the Name field. This is a relatively new approach,
and not yet widely in use. One example of how it’s
used presently is a feature of the newer iPods (those
that play video): The Name tag can scroll across the
screen as the show is playing. 
The pioneer in the use of Stuff is Rob Walch from
the Today in iPhone and Podcast 411 podcasts. He
uses the end of his Name field to add his voicemail
number — and actively encourages folks to get the
number right from their iPods during the show. This
is a great idea; many folks listen while driving, and
the last thing you want to do is send them digging
for a pen when they should be paying attention to
the road.
Of course, there are other things you can place here
besides a phone number. If your podcast is promo-
tion (or contains a promotion specific to your pod-
cast), you may want to include discount or coupon
codes in the Name field for your listeners to use
later. It’s also a neat way to pass along a secret mes-
sage, where the meaning is derived after several
episodes. Let your imagination run wild!
When you’re finished, you’ll run all these elements
together, and your final episode Name ID3 tag will
look something like this:
TiSM 080504: Stadium Advertising -
206.339.8765 Code: Baseball
Image
Tags can contain more than simply text. Of particu-
lar use to podcasters is the capability to embed an
image associated with a podcast or individual
episode. While we understand and accept that not
all mp3 players display embedded images, the iPod
certainly does, as shown in Figure 25-4. And as the
most popular mp3 player on the market today, it’s
an excellent branding tool.
Earlier we spoke of many listeners who manage
their own podcast playlists, bypassing their device’s
efforts to categorize for them. Having a Show ID
gives them a way to find your show quickly in a list
of others — or to know what they’re about to hear
prior to the track changing.
Sequential ID
This is a sequential number of your show. It enables
a podcatcher or listening device to stack your
shows up in the order in which they should be
played. But before you run with 1, 2, 3 . . . , remem-
ber that computers think the number 11 is really
“one-one,” which would appear before 2. Crazy, we
know. To combat this, consider using three-digit
numbers such as 001, 002, and so on. Of course,
this approach causes issues again when you reach
Episode 1000, which would be placed in-between
199 and 200.
The best numbering system — at least for the
Name ID3 tag — is to use the date. Don’t use 
May 4, 2008, but do use something like 080504
or 2008-05-04. Keeping with this Year-Month-Day
format ensures that your files will always stack up
in order. And it doesn’t really matter if you use the
recording date, editing date, or release date as your
number system, so long as you stick with that same
milestone going forward.
Episode title
What is this episode about? If you do an interview
show, perhaps the name of the guest is sufficient. Or
maybe there is a specific topic that you cover in
depth? If so, add it here. It’s free-form; you can make
it as long as you wish. But remember that this is just
the title of the episode; it should capture the spirit
of the episode in total. 
Yes, you can make it five sentences if you want, but
three to five words will probably be sufficient. And
please use spaces and proper capitalization. It just
makes you and your program look that much more
professional.

Additional Important Tags
211
• Figure 25-4: Showing the logo or image associated with
your show leaves your listeners with a great
impression.
The obvious choice for your image is the logo of
your show. If you don’t have one — get one. A con-
sistent branding message is important and helps
remind your listeners of what they are listening to
and what your show is all about. At a minimum,
open up your graphics editor and create a JPG with
the name of your show. While the nuances of
graphic production are beyond the scope of this
book, you should be able to create a 300 × 300 JPG
image without too much difficulty.
Additional Important Tags
While the tags we just described are non-negotiable
and truly should be included with each and every
episode, there are a few other tags that you can use
to help your listeners experience your show to the
max. While not required, they can be very helpful to
the listening audience — and might set your show
apart from the rest.
Compilation
This check box can be very helpful if your artist
changes from episode to episode, yet you still want
some grouping inside iTunes. By default, iTunes

stores the files on your listener’s computer system
first by Artist and then by Album. However, if the
Compilation ID3 tag is checked, that behavior
changes: All the Artists in the compilation are
grouped together by the Album itself. iTunes goes
one step farther, isolating all Compilations together
in one place. Figure 25-5 shows how the directory
structure changes for Compilations.
• Figure 25-5: Where Artists normally dictate the directory
structure, Compilations behave differently.
What’s the point? In some cases, the Artist will be
different on each file. Take the case of Pseudopod, a
horror magazine in podcast form that distributes
short stories each week. Up until the summer of
2007, they were setting the Artist ID3 tag to the
name of the original author of the story. By default,
iTunes was scattering these episodes through the
folder structure, giving each author (that is, each of
the Artists) its own folder. While finding the file to
play within the iTunes application isn’t difficult,
tracking down the actual file within the directory
structure is quite difficult; nothing was grouped by
the name Pseudopod.
Upon learning of the power of the Compilation tag,
the editors of this podcast simply checked this box,

without calling out the episode number in the show
itself. Plus, some applications may ignore your care-
ful planning. It’s always good to have fallbacks.
Year
Similar to the Track Number, the Year tag allows
you to identify when your file was created. For most
podcasts, this is taken care of inside the naming
convention — if it is deemed important at all. While
the immediate needs may not be apparent, it may
be useful for future historians who are piecing
together the timeline of your groundbreaking
program. (Hey . . . it could happen!)
The Best Laid Plans . . .
Having built an airtight case for paying close atten-
tion to your ID3 tags, we feel obligated to tell you
that all your efforts and attentions may be for
naught. iTunes, the podcatching device with the
largest audience share, has a nasty habit of over-
writing ID3 tags with information found in the
show’s RSS feed.
Yeah. That can ruin everything you’ve put in place.
And as of this writing, there is no way to tell iTunes
to leave your ID3 tags alone. For now, just know that
the following will happen to your ID3 tags before
they can go to anyone who subscribes to your show
through iTunes. (You can find out more about this in
Practice 27.)

Name: Overwritten by the contents of the
<title> RSS tag

Artist: Overwritten by the contents of the
<itunes:artist> RSS tag

Image: Overwritten by the contents of the
<itunes:image> RSS tag
Your only defense is to implement an equally
robust — as in “consistent with the tagging we’ve
just talked about” — naming convention in your RSS
development as well. Again, see Practice 27 for more
information.
causing all future episodes of the podcast to be eas-
ily found on a listener’s hard drive by simply navigat-
ing to the iTunes Music➪Compilations➪Pseudopod
folder. (Yes, your authors are using their powers for
good!)
Again, we stress that it isn’t difficult for the average
user to find these episodes within the iTunes appli-
cation — or any other listening application, for that
matter. But for the user with something more com-
plex in mind — who wants to create a CD archive of
past shows or perhaps share the mp3 file with a
friend — having all the files grouped together is
much easier.
Grouping
With the sheer number of podcast groups, networks,
and loose associations cropping up all the time, it’s
a shame that more podcasters — or the administra-
tors of these groups — aren’t making full use of the
powerful Grouping tag.
This little-used tag could allow all affiliated podcasts
to fly under the same banner with minimum hassle.
It doesn’t require them to change their file names,
titles, or anything else with their file. Just putting
the name of their group (say, Podshow, FarPoint
Media, Friends in Tech, or Blubrry) in this field
would allow those who want to sort affiliated pod-
casts and group them together. Ground-shaking? No,
not really. But there should be a reason that these
podcasts affiliate themselves with each other, so
why not take this designed-for opportunity and do it
in your ID3 tags?
Track Number
The Track Number is traditionally used to designate
the proper order in which audio files should play. In
fact, some applications that you or your listeners
may still use this as the “default sort” if contained in
the ID3 tagging. But you have taken charge of order-
ing on your own with your cleverly implemented
Name convention. However, 080504 doesn’t really
tell anyone how many previous shows have been
released. Adding in a Track Number can do this

Adding a Blog to
Your Podcast
B
logging and podcasting go hand in hand. In fact, we’ll go so far
as to say that podcasting probably could not have happened
without blogs blazing the trail. A specialized form of blogging —
audioblogging — predates the first podcast by several years. Though
many would claim that audioblogging and podcasting are one and the
same, we think that takes things a bit to far and completely ignores the
value of an enclosed media file. But we are willing to recognize the impor-
tant role that blogs played in shaping what we know today as podcasting.
You should know that it’s entirely possible to produce a podcast without
the use of blogging software. Some of the most popular podcasts, such as
Skepticality (http://skepticality.com), were completely conceived
and made popular by their fans on their own. If you have the technical
chops to host your own pages, change your home page, archive your old
content, and update your RSS 2.0 file without the use of a blog — go for it!
However, if you don’t posses those skills — or find yourself too busy to
do that much maintenance to keep your show current — blogging soft-
ware can take much of the burden off your shoulders. 
Why Use a Blog to Host Your Podcast?
Blogging software makes it easier to podcast. Listen, you’ve got plenty of
things to worry about while you’re creating your podcast: Writing,
recording, editing, hosting, posting, feedback . . . there are lots of moving
parts to keep track of. Why not automate as many of the repetitive tasks
as you possibly can? 
Incorporating a blog to maintain nearly all of your Web presence takes a lot
of the burden off your shoulders so you can focus on the ever-changing
aspects of your show. A blog can benefit you in the following ways:

Provides a consistent layout and design: The software ensures that
all your pages — even old show notes — have a consistent look and
feel. And if you want to change things, it takes only a few minutes to
change every page to the new design.

Practice 26: Adding a Blog to Your Podcast

One setback with Blogger is the lack of expandability.
Beyond what Blogger offers through its interface,
there is no way to build on the basics. Unlike with
WordPress (explained later in this practice) — which
offers plug-ins such as Akismet (a spam filter) and
PodPress (the must-have tool for podcasters that
provides an embedded player in the blogpost) —
you’re restricted to what Blogger wants you to use.
Blogger is a good starting place for beginning pod-
casters, but the limitations of it will come to light
after your production’s first season.
Blogger is free of charge, a low-cost investment
when you’re looking to start a podcast. So yes, it
may be limited in expandability, but it’s still a reli-
able blog host.
MySpace
There is no doubt that MySpace (www.myspace.com)
has taken the world of social media by storm. In fact,
many heavy users of MySpace rarely do anything but
consume content found on MySpace. 
Part of the MySpace experience, for registered mem-
bers, is posting and maintaining their own blogs
within their profiles. Much of the power and appeal
of MySpace is the reported ease of use, and the
included blog is no exception. With the click of a
link, you can post show notes and add a media file
(hosted somewhere else) to the RSS feed. 
However, MySpace users have very little control
over the look and feel of their blogs. Without ques-
tion, the start of the relationship is the profile page,
and the blog gets relegated to sidekick status.
Because of this, MySpace blogs tend to get read —
and subscribed to — by other MySpace users.
We give MySpace full marks for making it easy to cre-
ate a podcast feed, but we don’t recommend this
option for anyone looking to move into the expert
realm of podcasting. MySpace could be helpful to
your cause, but probably more of a place to promote
your show or interact with your fans. Social media
work fine for that.

Automatically archives content: Blogs are
content-management systems and keep track
of their own directory structure. By assigning
categories and tags to posts, you increase the
chances of someone finding your older content. 

Enables you to write text, not code: Maybe your
HTML skills aren’t as up to date as they once
were. With a blog, creating show notes and other
pages is often as simple as typing in text. WYSI-
WYG editors make creating links and adding
bulleted lists a breeze — without ever having to
write a line of code.

Provides automatic RSS updates: If you needed
a single reason why, this is it. While editing
XML isn’t hard, it’s also very easy to mess up.
A properly-set-up blog creates a perfect RSS file
every time you create a new show. That helps a
podcaster sleep better at night.
Blogging Solutions 
for Podcasters
Podcasters have a lot of choices when it comes to
selecting blogging software. While all of these pro-
grams do basically the same thing, they each have
unique characteristics that make them a preferred
tool among podcasters. Rather than trying to cover
the legions of applications available, we’ll stick with
the applications we have personal experience with,
winding up with an explanation of why we decided
on a single recommendation. Remember, however,
that the blog host you choose should be the best fit
for you and your needs.
Blogger
Now owned by Google, Blogger (www blogger.com)
was one of the first sites to offer blogging software.
Blogger offers many templates, created by both
users and the Blogger support team, that can be
customized to fit your needs (provided you’re fluent
in the XML that creates the layout). Blogger’s great-
est asset is its simple interface. You can either use a
GUI (Graphic User Interface) or an HTML Editor to
compose your blog posts.

Podcasting with WordPress

Movable Type
The Movable Type application (www.movable
type.com) is a very popular and powerful blogging
tool. Used by many large corporations, it features
easy-to-modify templates, a broad developer com-
munity, and a host of plug-ins to make the whole
experience of blogging and podcasting quite simple.
While a shared-hosting version is available (www.
typepad.com), the software gives you the most
flexibility if you install it on your own server. Many of
the popular hosting providers — including Yahoo!
Small Business hosting (http://smallbusiness.
yahoo.com) — allow you to install Movable Type on
your server with a few simple steps.
Movable Type is available for personal use free of
charge, though the support package (if necessary)
will set you back a few bucks for the year. You’ll want
to pay close attention to the language of the licensing
to make sure your podcast qualifies for this personal
license. If not, you’ll need to shell out $149.95 to pur-
chase a license if your podcast is of a commercial
nature or has multiple authors contributing. More
information (and current pricing) can be found at
www.movabletype.com/pricing.html.
But as powerful as Movable Type may be, it doesn’t
come with built-in native podcasting support.
Fortunately, this is easily remedied — just install
a freely available plug-in called (oddly enough) 
MT-Enclosures. With this add-on, MT is a very
robust and powerful podcasting solution.
WordPress
We saved the best for last. After trying the previ-
ously mentioned applications and a few home-grown
solutions, the results are in: We highly recommend
WordPress (www.wordpress.org) for podcasters. In
fact, the rest of this practice is dedicated to the vari-
ous options and settings to make WordPress into a
great podcasting tool. Even if you opt not to use
WordPress as your solution, you may find valuable
insight in our discussions.
Podcasting with WordPress
One handy way to demonstrate the effectiveness of
WordPress (www.wordpress.org) to podcasters is
by looking at the actual level of use in the podos-
phere. While there isn’t an accurate way to determine
how many podcasters use WordPress, it doesn’t take
much browsing of podcasts to start noticing how
many of them use the application. Keep your eyes
open for the powered by WordPress note at the bot-
tom of the page. Chances are, many of your favorite
podcasts are using WordPress to power their sites.
There are a variety of reasons that we recommend
WordPress as a blogging/podcasting tool. We’ve
highlighted a few key characteristics that we feel set
this program apart from the rest:

It’s PHP-based. Unlike other applications that
make use of proprietary code, WordPress is writ-
ten entirely in PHP. This widely used scripting lan-
guage is easy to learn and has a vast developer
community, should you get in over your head.

You can drag and drop plug-ins. Find the plug-in
you need, drop it into a folder, and activate it.
That’s usually all it takes to get your plug-in work-
ing and your blog’s functionality extended. No
need to add special code to your template pages!

It’s free. WordPress is distributed under an open
source license. So regardless of whether you’re
using this to host your personal site or one for
your company or organization, the code is free
to use and edit. (Note: As always, have your
lawyer read the Terms and Conditions.)
We’ll save the deep-dive on how to install WordPress
for the authors of WordPress For Dummies. This
practice focuses on showing you how to configure
WordPress for effective podcasting. Additionally,
we’ll cover a few must-have plug-ins — PodPress,
FeedBurner, and WP-Cache — that we think every
podcaster should use. As with most blogging tools,
the full power of WordPress comes into play after
it’s been extended — usually through the use of pre-
viously developed plug-ins. They are, like WordPress
itself, free to use.

• Figure 26-1: PodPress is so powerful it needs its own
menu bar inside WordPress.
Stats tab
There aren’t any configuration settings for the Stats
menu, but you may find yourself obsessing over the
information you find here. Try not to, okay? Read
Practice 35 for some insight on realistic expecta-
tions for audience size.
Feed/iTunes Settings tab
If you click the Feed/iTunes Settings tab, you’ll first
see some directory preview options for iTunes and
other large directories (refer to Figure 26-1). Keep in
mind that these are just approximations of how your
podcast will appear on these directories. If this is
your first time setting up PodPress, you won’t notice
much on there. Scroll down a bit.
Below the preview section are a whole host of options
that allow you to customize your podcast’s RSS feed,
as shown in Figure 26-2. We’ll run through the list,
down the left column and then back to the right, giv-
ing you some tips on what information goes in each.
Many of these settings override the standard
behavior of those you get with the basic
WordPress installation. That’s the whole idea!
All WordPress plug-ins come with different
installation instructions. For most, it’s a simple
matter of dropping the files into the plugins
directory and activating the plug-in from the
WordPress interface. But not always. Please
read the documentation to make sure your
installation goes smoothly. It usually does.
Installing and Configuring 
the PodPress Plug-in
While WordPress can handle podcasting out of the
box (just paste a link to a media file), it doesn’t
give you a lot of flexibility. Various ways around this
are available, but PodPress is by far the easiest to
use and the most robust among the lot. As creator
Dan Kuykendall says:
“The PodPress plug-in gives you everything
you need in one easy plug-in to use WordPress
for Podcasting.”
He’s not kidding. Get the latest version from
www.mightyseek.com/podpress and follow the
installation instructions. Be sure your Web server
and version of WordPress meet the requirements,
and read the comments-and-support forum if you
run into trouble.
After you have the plug-in installed and activated,
look for the addition of PodPress to your main menu
bar of WordPress. (Yes, it’s special enough to war-
rant its own primary menu. Figure 26-1 shows you
the location.)
After the PodPress plug-in is activated and you’ve
reached the configuration screen, you’ll see four
submenu options (detailed in upcoming sections):

• Figure 26-2: Use these settings to customize your
podcast’s RSS feed.
iTunes:FeedID 
After you’ve submitted your podcast to iTunes and
its directory has accepted your podcast (see
Practice 28), you’re issued an iTunes Music Store ID,
which is e-mailed to you. After you receive this ID,
enter it into the iTunes:Feed ID field.
If you’re already in the iTMS and don’t know what
your ID is, follow these steps to find it:
1.
Search for your podcast in the podcast direc-
tory of iTunes; when you find it, right-click
your listing. 
2.
In the resulting pop-up window, choose Copy
iTunes Store URL. 
3.
Lots of other information besides your ID is in
this URL, so paste it somewhere else first.
The URL should look something like this:
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/
MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=25
5781463
You remove the extra stuff from the URL in the
next step. 
4.
You only want the numbers after id=. Paste
those into the PodPress iTunes Feed:ID field. 
In the example, that would be 255781463.
To the right of the Feed ID, you’ll see a button
labeled Ping iTunes Update. This is a failsafe mecha-
nism to let iTunes know that your feed has been
updated. You shouldn’t need to click this button
every time you update a new episode of your pod-
cast. But if you notice that your newest episodes are
not appearing on iTunes, click away!
iTunes:New-Feed-Url
Here’s where PodPress starts to get ahead of itself a
bit; this option won’t make a lot of sense until we get
to the “Podcast Feed URL” section in a moment.
Unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise,
leave this set to Disable.

Practice 26: Adding a Blog to Your Podcast

iTunes:Image (300*300 pixels)
Here’s the place to really make your podcast shine. If
you’ve been podcasting for a while, you already have
a logo. Make sure it’s in JPG format and that its size
is 300 pixels square. If that’s gibberish to you, find
someone to do it so that it looks great. Having an
outstanding graphic for your podcast won’t ensure
you a spotlight by iTunes on their home page, but
having a poor-quality one can keep you out of the
running. See Practice 29 for more about why.
iTunes:Author/Owner
Enter your name or the name of your podcasting
group. iTunes will use this to complete the Artist
section of your listing.
iTunes:Subtitle
Keep this one short and sweet. iTunes uses it as
your default description for each episode, but it will
likely be overwritten by your episode descriptions.
iTunes:Keywords
You can add up to 12 keywords (spaces are okay).
Make sure you separate them by following each one
with a comma. It’s also a good idea to repeat any
keywords you used in the Summary field.
iTunes:Categories
Select the most appropriate listing(s) for your pod-
cast based on the information in these drop-down
menus. Try to get as specific as you can, but don’t
feel obligated to use all three of the entry areas.
Many podcasts get by with just one or two.
iTunes:Explicit
If you are talking about adult situations or using pro-
fanity in your cast, be safe and mark it as Explicit,
even though you may not find it offensive. iTunes
tends to take a very conservative approach to listing
shows. Err on the side of caution here.
You’ll notice that this section comes with its
own warning. Pay attention to the caution, but
don’t be afraid of it. PodPress is good at giving
you lots of flexibility, but it does require
that you type things correctly.
During your career as a podcaster, you may decide
to pack up your show and move from one location
to another. This sometimes requires getting a whole
new RSS feed address. iTunes makes it fairly simple
to keep your current subscribers listening to your
episodes without their having to subscribe to your
new feed address. This is the tag.
If you are going to use this feature, Apple suggests
also configuring your old feed to redirect to your
new feed location. But in reality, you may not have
this kind of control over the old feed. In practice, this
isn’t an issue — for your iTunes subscribers. But
your subscribers who don’t use iTunes as their pod-
catching client will have to manually update their
podcatchers with your new feed. 
iTunes:Summary
This is the text that iTunes uses when displaying
your podcast inside iTunes. You can say whatever
you want, but we recommend being descriptive and
brief. iTunes gives some very good advice on taking
full advantage of this field:
“Describe your subject matter, media format,
episode schedule, and other relevant info so
that they know what they’ll be getting when
they subscribe. In addition, make a list of the
most relevant search terms that you want
your podcast to match, then build them into
your description. Note that iTunes removes
podcasts that include lists of irrelevant words
in the iTunes:Summary, Description, or
iTunes:Keywords tags.”
Great advice and an excellent warning. iTunes lets
you use up to 4,000 characters, though you proba-
bly won’t need to use that many.

iTunes:TTL (time-to-live)
This tag seems to have been deprecated (aban-
doned and no longer used) in iTunes 7.0. If you fill it
out, iTunes will just ignore it. 
iTunes:Block
We can’t overstress the importance of being very,
very careful with this option. It merits a warning of
its own:
Once a podcast has been blocked by iTunes
with this setting, it’s nearly impossible to get it
back and listed on iTunes without some major
hurdles, like changing the URL of the RSS
feed. It’s really really hard. Take it from our
experience. If you decide to podfade (as
described in Part VIII) and choose to use this
setting, understand that it’s about as perma-
nent as you can make it. So choose wisely.
And that brings us to the end of the current iTunes
tags. Whew! But we’re not finished yet. Now scroll
back up and let’s deal with the items on the right
side of the screen, to get your RSS feed in tip-top
shape.
Podcast Feed URL
This is the counterpart to that cryptic iTunes:New-
Feed-URL tag from the previous section. Simply type
in the full URL to your podcast. This could be your
FeedBurner address (described later in this prac-
tice) or your default WordPress feed at http://
www.yourpodcast.com/feed.
Blog/Podcast title
This one is pretty self-explanatory. How do you want
your podcast to be listed? By what name should it
be known? Enter it here.
Blog Description
The standard description for your feed goes here.
Chances are, it will be exactly the same as the one
you entered in the iTunes:Summary field.
Blog/RSS Image (144*144 pixels)
Similar to the iTunes:Image tag mentioned earlier,
this tag determines the image that will display on
many applications in association with your podcast.
Follow the same rules as given for the iTunes:image
tag, as it’s always a good idea to make a great visual
impression.
Okay, the size restrictions just given are mis-
leading. The actual RSS specs place a width
restriction of 144 pixels on these images.
However, the maximum height of an image is
400 pixels. As long as your JPG, GIF, or PNG
file is no wider than 144 and no taller than
400 pixels, it’ll be fine.
Owner E-mail address
Time for another warning:
If you don’t have enough spam in your life,
you can get tons more if you put your real
e-mail address here. Sad to say, it’s easily
harvested and fed to spambots. But it’s also
necessary to list a proper e-mail address so
that people who find your feed might get in
touch with you. We recommend adding the
text nospam to your real e-mail address. For
example: evo@nospam.podiobooks.com
is what Evo uses; this format helps block most
spam yet makes it pretty obvious what to take
out for the humans who are trying to reach you.
Language
Select the appropriate value. Notice the various
regional dialects.
Show Download Links in RSS Encoded Content
Sometimes the tech-talk gets in the way of the
English; we apologize for the momentary lapse. All
that it means is that PodPress will create a visual
link for people to see on your site (or wherever your
information is syndicated) so folks can easily down-
load the enclosed media files without having to use

4.
Save the file to your desktop. 
In Firefox, choose File➪Save Page As and set
your desktop as the destination.
5.
Check the size of the file you saved by right-
clicking (or Ctrl-clicking) the file. 
If the file is over 256K, you’ll need to reduce the
number of posts to display in the RSS 2.0 feed.
Don’t push it, because the size of each of your
posts is probably flexible. We suggest trying
to keep it under 200K; that way you have
some wiggle room to accommodate lengthy
show notes on a couple of episodes.
Encoding for Pages and Feeds
Unless you have a good reason not to, keep this as
UTF-8. It will make sure that your feed is as accessi-
ble as possible.
Aggressively Protect the Feed
We’re torn on this one. On one hand, strange charac-
ters (usually introduced when cutting and pasting
from word-processing applications) can wreak
havoc on RSS 2.0 feeds. On the other hand, links and
images are just fine inside the feed — especially
when using PodPress. If straight text is all you ever
include in your posts, go ahead and use this setting.
But if you think images inside your posts are impor-
tant and should be used in the feed as well, leave it
set to No.
And so ends the plethora of PodPress iTunes/Feed
settings. (What? You thought we were done? Not
quite.)

in Figure 26-3. Luckily, there aren’t nearly as many.

have to create your own Download This File link in
your show notes. Get it?
RSS Category
Anything you like. There are currently no standards
on RSS categorization, so it’s up to you to decide
how to list it. For example, Evo lists the
Podiobooker Podcast category as audio books.
RSS Copyright
This is simply a date range. Unfortunately, you’ll
have to remember to return to this screen every
year to update it. In future releases, we’re all hoping
for a perpetual feature here so the RSS copyright
data changes right along with the Web-server date
as it changes.
Show the Most Recent
You may be tempted to change this from the default
10 to something like 100. That’s okay, more or less,
but remember that RSS feeds are meant to contain
recent information about your podcast and blog as
opposed to containing every post and podcast you
ever created. In fact, some useful applications — for
example, FeedBurner — cease reading your file if it
gets to be too large. 256K is the accepted norm for
file size. So if you want to try 30 or 40 posts to dis-
play in your RSS feed, go for it — but make ’em
short! You’ll want to check the file size to make sure
it isn’t too large. Here’s how:
1.
Change the value to 40. 
2.
Click the Update Options button.
3.
Reload your Web page and click your
Subscribe link to see your RSS feed.
If you are using FeedBurner or other RSS rewrit-
ing tools, you’ll need to use your original or base
RSS feed.

Adding a Media File with PodPress
221
• Figure 26-3: The General Settings tab.
Media File Locations
Chances are, you put your media files in the same
directory each and every time you put up a new
episode. If you do, you’re in luck: PodPress antici-
pates this and offers to save you all that typing. All
you have to do is type in the full path to the direc-
tory where you keep your audio files.
If you host with Libsyn, for example, this entry will
look something like this:
http://media.libsyn.com/media/
mypodcast
If you host your media files on the same server that
holds WordPress and PodPress, it gets a little more
complicated — and can look like this:
/usr/local/psa/home/vhosts/mypod-
cast.com/httpdocs//wp-content/
uploads
Don’t put the trailing slash at the end of your
directories. PodPress will do that for you when
you enter in the file name of your most recent
episode.
Download Statistics
You get to choose whether to use the stats package
that comes with PodPress. Personally, we use them
but don’t pay a whole lot of attention to them. 
(We much prefer to count subscriber activity rather
than individual downloads of episodes. But your
mileage may vary.) Also, PodPress gives you the
capability to integrate it with PodTrac’s own track-
ing system. (We talk more about PodTrac and other
advertising-driven networks in Practice 47.)
The rest of the options on this page are your prefer-
ence. Try them out and see how they work for you. 
The golden rule: If you don’t know what it is,
don’t mess with it.
And that’s it! You are now set to podcast with
WordPress and PodPress.

Adding a Media File with
PodPress
With all of those settings . . . set, it’s now time to
show you how to actually use PodPress to add an
enclosed media file to your show notes.
Adding the media file
Follow these steps to add a media file:
1.
Choose Write➪Write Post from the main tool-
bar of WordPress. 
2.
Complete the title and body fields.
Like nearly all blogging solutions, WordPress
allows you to create a title and body for each of
your posts. Complete these fields as you normally
would — but don’t put a link to your media file in
either field. PodPress creates a new field to take
care of that function.

The Auto Detect feature doesn’t always work,
depending on the sever configurations of
where your media files are housed. If it’s not
working for you, you can enter in the values
manually. 
8.
Unless you have a very good reason not to
(and we can’t think of any), keep the boxes
checked to include this media file in your RSS
2.0 and Atom feeds. 
9.
You may also opt to disable the automatic
PodPress player if your site has trouble 
displaying the Flash player properly.

PodPress also allows you to display some of

See Practice 26 for specifics on how to take full

shown in Figure 26-4. 
You’ll note that by default the Post excerpt (the

for both the Subtitle and the Summary. We’re not
big fans of that, and would prefer that you
change it, as described next.

WP-Cache Plug-in
223
Testing
The price of freedom (and a smoothly running pod-
cast) is eternal vigilance. Here are a few things to test:

Visit your blog and check to make sure that the
Download button that PodPress created for
you works — and that your episode plays. If it
doesn’t, you may have entered the file name or
the path to your media files incorrectly.
Examining the link and make sure an extra /
character isn’t showing up and that you’ve cor-
rectly entered the path.

Check your RSS 2.0 feed visually. To do so,
click the link to your feed in your browser. We
suggest viewing the source of the file and search-
ing for the term enclosure. Your episode’s media
file should be listed. 

Validate your feed. Copy the URL of your feed
(not of your podcast episode) and paste it in the
field at http://feedvalidator.org. Doing so
checks for any special character additions (often
from those pesky word processors) and other
errors. Correct any issues with your feed as 
necessary.
Now that we have PodPress wrapped up and you’re
podcasting with the big kids, let’s talk about two
more plug-ins we find invaluable. Don’t worry — we
won’t take quite as deep a dive here!
FeedBurner Feed Replacement
Plug-in
FeedBurner is a free service that does quite a few
great things for podcasters — for instance, giving
you the best set of stats (in our opinion) on how
people are subscribing to and using your feed.
Although plenty of folks don’t use FeedBurner in
their podcasting endeavors, many (and probably
most) podcasters do. We use the service and can
easily recommend it. For more information, check
out http://feedburner.com for case studies and
a thorough FAQ section.
If you decide to use FeedBurner, we highly recom-
mend installing the FeedBurner Feedsmith plug-in. It
ensures that all your subscribers are routed through
FeedBurner — resulting in the most relevant stats
possible. We detail how to set up FeedBurner in
Practice 26. For now, download and install the 
plug-in from www.feedburner.com/fb/a/help/
wordpress_quickstart.
Don’t activate the plug-in until you’ve created
your feed with FeedBurner. Again, see Practice
28 for more about this simple process.
WP-Cache Plug-in
When your podcast gets popular and more people
are checking you out from day to day, your Web site
will get slow. Worse, as you get more subscribers,
you may start to blow through your monthly
bandwidth allotment. That won’t be the fault of
your media files, provided you host them on a dedi-
cated media-hosting site. We’re talking about the
bandwidth hit your Web server takes when you start
serving out thousands and thousands of RSS feeds
and requests every day.
If you’ve noticed your site slowing down or are con-
cerned about bandwidth, check out the WP-Cache
plug-in at http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-
cache-2/. Here’s how the creator of the plug-in
describes it:
“WP-Cache is an extremely efficient WordPress
page-caching system to make your site much
faster and responsive. It works by caching
WordPress pages and storing them in a static
file for serving future requests directly from the
file rather than loading and compiling the
whole PHP code and then building the page
from the database. WP-Cache allows you to
serve hundred of times more pages per sec-
ond, and to reduce the response time from
several tenths of a second to less than a 
millisecond.”

Practice 26: Adding a Blog to Your Podcast
224
One final thought on caching: Some information,
ranging from newly published episodes to PodPress
statistics, won’t be updated on each page refresh.
Instead, it may take a few minutes to see changes
to these items. That’s what caching is all about —
putting less of a stress on the database that powers
your Web site. Our advice? Be patient. Then check
again.
If that got confusing, just read the first sentence
again. It makes your site faster. ’Nuff said. Oh, except
for this:
Installing WP-Cache does require some effort.
Some plug-ins can be installed in simple drag-
and-drop format — but this isn’t one of them.
Because this plug-in requires some editing 
of your PHP files, don’t attempt it if you shy
away from editing code. Yes, you can break
things if you do this wrong. However, if you
get Dugg or BoingBoinged without it, you
may be in trouble. Get a techie friend to help
you out if necessary.

Validating Your
RSS Feed
I
f you’ve come this far down the road to becoming an expert podcaster,
you should have an understanding of what an RSS feed is and what it
does for you. Should you be looking at those three letters for the first
time and wonder, “What have I gotten myself into?” — well, we need to
talk. Podcasting is not podcasting without an RSS feed. Recording an
audio or video file and posting it on a Web site is not the same thing as
podcasting. It’s the “casting” part that’s important to this conversation.
When you watch your DVD set of The Sopranos, you aren’t watching a
television broadcast. When you listen to the CD collection “I Heard It on
NPR” in your car or at home, you aren’t listening to a radio broadcast.
Granted, the material — or content — in both might be the same as was
available in a previous broadcast form, but you’ve skipped the “casting”
part and are using a different medium to consume the content.
Why is this distinction important? Because The Sopranos would not have
become the popular show that it is without the audience that the show
reached from its broadcast. DVD sales are just icing on the cake.
Incredibly profitable and expensive icing, but icing nonetheless. The
same holds true for NPR. In order to make a collection titled “I Heard It
on NPR,” someone had to hear the content first as a broadcast.
Posting audio and/or video files to a Web site and allowing folks to down-
load them at their convenience should also be considered the icing on a
podcaster’s cake. It’s easy to do — and many folks choose this method of
consuming the content — but it’s not the primary intended distribution
method. Where radio and TV requires either a transmitting tower or
some sort of digital encoding system to deliver content, what you need is
a very small, lightweight, and 100%-compatible text file to accomplish the
same goal in the podcasting world. 
That text file is called an RSS feed. In this practice, we show you how to
take full advantage of your RSS feed — and how to avoid some common
pitfalls that can (and all too often do) gum up the works. If you’re inter-
ested in a deeper discussion on creating RSS feeds from scratch, check
out Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies or take a hard look
at Chapter 9 of Podcasting For Dummies (Wiley), an excellent resource for
those just starting out in their podcasting careers.

play. Or maybe it skips. The same holds true for
the Items in a podcast’s RSS file. Missing or
incomplete data results in an error or (more
likely) prevents the episode from being delivered
to subscribers. Both the CD track and the Item
require the complete assembly of all necessary
data to work properly.

The packaging of a music CD is analogous to
the Channel section of an RSS feed. The CD
contains cover art, liner notes, the image
stamped on the CD, copyright notices, and a few
other data elements. This packaging is consis-
tent for all the individual song tracks. In data
terms, it’s the equivalent of a larger parent direc-
tory that holds the Items. That’s the exact pur-
pose that the Channel element serves: It tells the
listener who was responsible for the content,
delivers images and information about the con-
tent’s maker, and carries other data points to
describe all the subsequent content (in this
case, the various Items).

The CD and player communicate with one
another to determine what to access and what
to ignore; that’s the very same role the header
portion of an RSS file plays. Because not all CDs
are created equal, when you drop a new music
CD into the CD drive for your computer, you may
get a very different experience than if you used
your home stereo. Music videos may play. Links
to additional content on the band’s Web site
might become available. Your home stereo prob-
ably can’t handle these functions, so the CD and
the player communicate with one another to
determine what should be accessed and what
should be ignored. In a similar way, the header
portion of an RSS file communicates with the
feed reader, helping the reader determine which
of the included data elements to access, and
which ones to ignore.
Okay, so much for the high-level analogy. Next up is
a look at some specific elements of RSS that you’ll
need to concern yourself with.
RSS Deconstructed
RSS is nothing scary. It’s just text in a specialized
format known as XML. That’s an acronym for
eXtensible Markup Language — and it is, for the
most part, pretty easy to read, understand, and edit.
The good news is that you, as a podcaster, probably
don’t need to worry about it too much; most tools
you use to create your podcast (see Practice 24)
take care of most of the heavy lifting for you. But it’s
a good idea to have at least an understanding and
working knowledge of this process — it’s your main
tool for distributing your content to listeners.
An RSS file consists of three main sections:

A Header section that describes the technical
aspects of the file.

A Channel section that describes various aspects
of the content of the file — and where it came
from.

One or more Items, each providing information
and attributes about a particular . . . item (in our
case, a single episode of a podcast).
These three sections work in concert with one
another to make sure that your audience’s podcast
aggregators (or news readers, feed readers, pod-
catchers, whatever) can translate the RSS feed and
allocate the content in human-readable format. To
illustrate this, let’s look at the similarities between
on off-the-shelf music CD and the RSS feed of a pod-
cast. Oddly enough, the analogy holds — but it’s
best illustrated in reverse:

For purposes of this illustration, consider that
the individual song tracks on the CD are the
same as the various Items in an RSS feed.
Arguably, the individual song tracks on the CD
are the most important or crucial parts of the
music CD itself. Each track contains the content
that the listener is trying to access. If there are
any errors on the track itself, the song won’t

The enclosed DVD with this book contains a file
called the Perfect Annotated RSS File. You may want
to refer to that from time to time as you read this
section. (If we could manage to shove the RSS feed
into the format of this printed book, the result
would be difficult to read at best.) Alternatively, you
could just use that file (without the annotations) as
your base file and skip the rest of this section alto-
gether. We’re nothing if not accommodating!
Header information
We mentioned earlier that RSS is simply a version of
XML. True enough, but we need to get a lot more
specific about describing the file inside the header.
It should start with the following piece of text, in
this exact form:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
This declaration requires that any reader applica-
tion that attempts to process this file be able to
understand version 1.0 XML and that it be able to
handle the most commonly used character set, 
UTF-8. If the reader can’t accommodate these
requirements (and all feed readers must be able 
to), then it ignores the contents of the file. Bottom
line: Always use the declarative statement shown
here to start off your XML file. Always. Seriously.
If the reader application can get past that initial
declarative statement, the RSS feed has to prep the
application for the various sorts of data elements it
can expect — and it needs your help. 

First, you have to declare the version of RSS
required — in this case, 2.0. While there are
many versions of RSS, only 2.0 includes the nec-
essary <enclosure> tag that is used to auto-
matically retrieve and store attached media files.
(You know . . . podcasting!)

Additionally, you have to declare what other
sorts of non-standard RSS data elements will
be encountered in the later portions of the file.
Think of this as like telling a visiting delegate
what sorts of foreign languages she might
encounter on her visit to another country, so
she can arrange to have translators travel with
her. In the world of RSS, these languages are
called namespaces, and there are lots of them. 
In fact, you could create your own namespace
and make your own data elements — as long as
you’re willing to create the translation docu-
ments and convince the makers of the podcatch-
ers and feed aggregators to include support for
your elements.
For the purposes of this section, we’ll concern our-
selves with only two additional declarations: 

One to allow you to pass in images, HTML, and
other non-standard elements

One to allow you to pass the values necessary to
take full advantage of iTunes, the most popular
podcatcher as of this writing
To accomplish this, the next line of text in your RSS
feed should look just like this:
<rss version=”2.0”
xmlns:content=”http://purl.org/rss/
1.0/modules/content/”
xmlns:itunes=”http://www.itunes.com
/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd” >
Note the URL passed after each namespace declara-
tion. Although this Web site has no code that your
newsreader can execute immediately, it does help
ensure that the newsreader uses the right set of
namespace variables. It’s a complicated process;
just make sure you type it in exactly as shown here.
Channel information
Remember that the Channel section of your feed
describes your podcast show, not the individual
episodes. Keep the music CD case and packaging
metaphor in mind as you look through Table 27-1 for
a list of the important tags. And refer to the Perfect
Annotated RSS File on the DVD.

iTunes elements
iTunes elements are critical to the success of a pod-
cast. We’re not making a political statement here,
but rather are acknowledging that over 50% of lis-
teners to public podcasts do so with the help of
iTunes. While there are many other directories and
organizations — each with their own XML name-
spaces and special elements — none has the heft of
iTunes. When that changes, we’ll write another book
and tell you how to take advantage of those as well.
We cover much of this in Practice 26 (it’s rele-
vant to setting up WordPress). Even if you
aren’t using WordPress, you may want to read
that section for additional information on how
iTunes uses this information.
Table 27-2 shows you the required iTunes tags.
Unlike the standard RSS tags we just showed you,
these are all the current iTunes elements. Keep an
eye on http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/
podcaststechspecs.html in the event that any new
elements are added. Which will probably happen.
iTunes categories
iTunes uses its own category system — which often
trips up podcasters who are creating their own
feeds. Start by selecting the right categories for your
show from the list provided by iTunes. They have
been known to change, but the most current list (as
of this writing) can be found at

Games & Hobbies category, Hobbies has the trailing
/ character to end the tag, but the wrapped parent
category has the more standard start-and-ending-tag
sequence you’re used to seeing in element tags.
Notice that we didn’t use a standard & symbol
in our example for Games & Hobbies? That’s
because the ampersand is a special character —
and can cause all kinds of headaches. We cover
that in the “Avoiding Pitfalls” section directly
ahead.
Item Information
Now that you have properly identified what sorts of
readers can accept your information and provided
the basic packaging information about your podcast
in general, it’s time to describe the actual content
itself in a series of <item> declarations.
As stated earlier, the Items of your file are analogous
to individual song tracks on a CD. They each
have their own names, descriptions, and many more
attributes. And our analogy goes further than you
might think: Each Item will also need to have an
associated — or enclosed — media file to go along
with it.
The various attributes of the Item section look quite
similar to the attributes we just discussed in the
prior section. Let’s start with Table 27-3, a list of the
same elements — but with different content from
that used in the Channel section. Instead of provid-
ing an example of how to format the tag (it’s exactly
the same formatting), we give you some pointers on
what sort of information to include.
You can select up to three categories on iTunes.
When you make your selection, pay close attention
to any category/subcategory relationship. For exam-
ple, you cannot select the entire Technology cate-
gory, because it has four subcategories beneath it.
However, you can select the TV & Film category,
because no subcategories are listed under the main
category. (Yes, it’s a little confusing.)
When listing iTunes categories to your file, consider
that subcategories need to be wrapped by their par-
ent category; categories that have no subcategories
are listed with a trailing slash character (/) to sig-
nify the end. That’s confusing to explain in text, so
an example is in order. Here’s exactly how you
would add iTunes category statements to your file if
you wanted to associate your show with the follow-
ing categories: 

Comedy

Games & Hobbies ➪Hobbies

Music
Here’s the corresponding code:
<itunes:category text=”Comedy” />
<itunes:category text=”Games &amp;
Hobbies”>
<itunes:category text=”Hobbies” />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text=”Music” />
The Comedy and Music categories have no subcate-
gories, so they are listed on their own, but with the
trailing / to signify the end of the tag. Because the
Hobbies category is a subcategory of the larger

Three possible values: yes, no and

clean. If it has explicit material in it, 
set it to yes so iTunes can display a 
parental-warning icon. If it’s squeaky 
clean so iTunes can show a “Clean” icon 
by your content, mark it as such. If 
it’s neither, then set it to no.

RSS Reconstructed
231
As promised, the Items section has a few new tags
that are specific to this area only, as they don’t have
any application in the larger Channel context.
Setting keywords with the <itunes:keywords> tag
You can use up to a maximum of 12 keywords, sepa-
rated by spaces. It’s not well known exactly how
iTunes uses these keywords when it returns search
results, so we suggest entering them in the search
box exactly the way you think others might enter
them.
Keeping each episode unique with the <guid> tag
GUID stands for Global Unique IDentifier, though
there’s nothing global about it. Rather, it has to be a
unique string of characters found within your pod-
cast feed. The easiest way to accommodate this
need is by setting your GUID to the same value as
your Item’s <link> value — provided you use a dif-
ferent URL for each of your episodes “pages” on
your site. If not, you may have to use some sort of
episodic-numbering system combined with the
<pubDate> tag. It can be anything you like, as long
as it’s unique to your feed.
Attaching media files with an <enclosure> tag
This is it — finally — the part that makes a podcast
a podcast: the enclosure file. This file requires three
components to work:

Practice 27: Validating Your RSS Feed
232
This new element allows us to embed HTML code
inside the <description> element of our Items.
This capability is becoming more important as news-
readers become more sophisticated and would-be
Web visitors consume more and more of their con-
tent via RSS — without ever visiting the Web site
where the content originated. If you’ve spent a lot of
time adding the appropriate images and formatting
to your show-notes post, the <content:encoded>
tag lets you wrap up that hard work in a package and
distribute it to the newsreaders that will accept it.
Not all readers can display HTML, CSS, and
other code inside posts. In fact, iTunes doesn’t
display the text at all unless someone goes
looking for it. But this situation won’t cause
you a problem because you’ve made your
declaration statement earlier. Any reader that
cannot accommodate this section will ignore 
it — and default to the plain text found inside
the <description> field.
The usage of the content:encoded tag takes the
following form:
<content:encoded><![CDATA[DYAMIC_CODE
_HERE></content:encoded>
and an example of its use might look like this:
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a
<em>beautiful</em>day!</p>]]>
</content:encoded>
Of course, you can do a lot more with this code as
well. Here’s a real-world example from one of Evo’s
feeds. We’ve put the dynamic stuff in bold to make it
easier to see:

Adding rich content
So far we’ve been content to add standard text and a
few links to some images. You may recall that in the
“Reconstruction” section of this practice, we asked
you to add a namespace called simply content.
That namespace allows for many new elements to
extend the RSS format, but we’re really only inter-
ested in one: <content:encoded>.

So — as you can see — you can put a whole lot of
content inside this tag.
Avoiding Pitfalls
Okay, we know all that was a lot to take in. And
chances are good that your podcast’s Web site or
blogging platform already kicks out this data (and
probably a lot more) on its own, and in fine form.
However, there are a few pitfalls that you need to be
aware of so you can make sure you don’t fall prey. 
Special characters
Remember that your RSS file is, at its most basic, a
text file. Not a file kicked out by a word-processing
application, but a plain text file. The distinction is
important enough for us to stress a couple of times. 
Word processes do not, by default, create text files.
Instead they create stylized, formatted documents.
What we call a word processor is really a layout-and-
formatting application for text. During the stylizing
process, the word processor takes your standard key-
board input and makes some subtle changes. When
you end a sentence with three dots (an ellipsis) — as
one of your authors does all too often — your word
processor converts those three periods into a special
character. It still consists of three dots, but it’s much
tighter and looks better. When you type in a colon 
followed by an ending parenthesis mark, your word
processor probably converts that input to a happy-
face icon on-screen. The same happens for quotes,
double-dashes, and many other characters.
While that may actually make for a better-looking
document, it can — and will — wreak havoc on your
RSS feed if you leave these special characters in
place when creating your feed. When you copy the
body of your document, you’re copying the special
characters and not the true text you initially entered.
And since these special characters are not UTF-8
characters (see “Header information” earlier in this
practice), your RSS feed will be invalid — and many
(or most) newsreaders will be unable to read the
feed. In other words, your audience won’t be able to
get your show.
The best way to ensure that special characters do
not wind up in your feed is to use something other
than a word-processing application to create your
show notes and other entries. Most operating sys-
tems come with a default plain-text application. It’s
called Notepad on the PC and TextEdit on a Mac. If
you create and copy your text from here, you should
have no special character issues.

mistakes. If you want that option enabled, keep
the box checked and delete the non-words at the
top of the list. 
3.
Click the AutoFormat as You Type tab and
uncheck all of the boxes. 
This prevents the curly quote issue and double-
dash problems.
4.
Click the AutoFormat tab and uncheck all
boxes.
They really want you to use curly quotes. You
really don’t want to.
5.
Click OK when you’re finished.
Just so you know: This procedure changes the way
your word-processing application behaves from now
on — or at least until you go back and change it again.
If you really like the way that Word automatically
did things for you previously, well, sorry, it won’t do
those things any longer. Consider whether you can
live with those changes for all your documents, or
whether you should use a text-only editor to handle
anything you’re inserting into your podcast feed.
Special characters are a big problem when
text from word-processing programs gets
dropped into the text fields of blogging plat-
forms. So even if you aren’t editing your feed
by hand, special characters can still cause
issues. Text editors are your friends . . .
Duplicate <guid>s
If you’re using a blogging solution such as WordPress
to create your feed, duplicate <guid> tags should not
be a problem. But everyone else should remember
that the U in <guid> stands for unique — it cannot be
repeated in your feed or it will cause errors on some
(or all) podcatching clients. Be sure you use some-
thing that will always be different.
File size
Issues arise when your RSS feed gets too big for its
britches. The feed readers have to parse (read: read)
the entire file and they tend to get a little cranky
But what if you’re a terrible speller? Well, we cer-
tainly didn’t write this book in TextEdit. You can do
a few things to your word-processing application to
make it friendlier to RSS creation. 
Open Microsoft Word and follow these instructions
to remove the special formatting:
1.
Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect.
This opens the AutoCorrect dialog box shown in
Figure 27-1.
These instructions were written for Word
2004 for Mac and Word 2003 for Windows.
Your particular installation of Word may be
slightly different.
• Figure 27-1: Turning off AutoFormatting in Word can
reduce errors on your RSS feed later.
2.
Uncheck the Replace as You Type box. 
This selection ensures that ellipses and other
characters aren’t replaced with special charac-
ters. However, this also means that Word will
no longer auto-correct your common spelling

Avoiding Pitfalls

when the file gets too large. Even worse, FeedBurner
will not process RSS feeds that exceed 256K, and
iTunes has been known to break when trying to read
files above that size as well. Keep your file size down
to less than 256K and you should have no issues.
Remember that this refers only to the size of the
text file itself. Your attached media files and images
won’t bulk up your text file.
Dates and times
The fields <pubDate> and <lastBuildDate>
require that you pass in the date and time in a prop-
erly formatted fashion, following the RFC2822 stan-
dard. We’ll save you the tech-speak and stress that
the dates all follow one of the two following formats:
<pubDate>Wed, 6 Jul 2005 13:00:00
PDT</pubDate>
or
<pubDate>Wed, 6 Jul 2005 13:00:00 -
0700</pubDate>

The day of the month can be expressed in either sin-

expressed in four digits. Be sure to remember the
comma after the day of the week.
The time stamp should be expressed in 24-hour or
military time and always have all positions filled.
In other words, 2:15 AM should be expressed as
02:15:00. Don’t forget your initial zero, if necessary,
and to include the seconds. 
No media files in the feed
Many podcasters use their blogging platform to blog
between episodes. That means the podcast feed
might actually have non-podcast elements (that is,
Items without enclosed media files) inside. This isn’t
a problem; most available feed readers can handle
enclosures and non-enclosed items with ease. Even
iTunes, the most popular podcatching client, is fine
with Items without enclosed media files — it just
ignores them.
But iTunes — and perhaps other directories — will
have a problem with your feed if they don’t detect
any enclosure files in the feed at all. This is really
only a problem for the serial blogger who also puts
out the occasional podcast. If you post ten non-
podcast blog entries and you’re only including the
last ten posts in your RSS feed, then iTunes (and
possibly other directories) won’t have a whole lot
to show for you in the iTunes Music Store. Someone
may search and find your podcast, but it will look
like you haven’t released any episodes — only
because iTunes couldn’t find any in your most
recent feed.
To combat this potential misunderstanding, make
sure you have enough posts inside your feed to
always contain your last podcast. Don’t forget the
file-size restriction we mentioned earlier. If that
doesn’t do the trick, maybe you need to podcast a
bit more!

Practice 27: Validating Your RSS Feed
236
• Figure 27-3: A properly formatted feed gets you kudos
from the site. To be safe, check it each time
you publish a new file.
• Figure 27-4: Errors may happen, but at least they tell you
where the problems are.
If your test returns something other than Valid,
then scroll down the page to identify where the
problem occurred. The Feed Validator will highlight
problems in yellow, giving you an easy way to find
the culprit. After making the necessary corrections,
return to this page and try again. Keep this process
going until you get a perfectly validated file. Then be
sure to return to the page and repeat the process
each time you update your RSS feed.
Stop Worrying: Validate 
Your Feed Often
We finish this rather longish practice with a way you
can seriously reduce your worrying about keeping a
valid feed — and get back to worrying about making
a great podcast. 
You can stare at your podcast’s RSS feed all day long
and never see problems. That’s because you aren’t a
feed-reader application, and aren’t tuned to pick up
on those problems. Luckily for you (and us), some
smart folks have put together a free service that
every podcaster should be using on a regular basis.
The simple and elegant interface to this online tool
is shown in Figure 27-2.
• Figure 27-2: Using the free Feed Validator early and often
can help identify problems in your feed.
Copy your feed address and visit http://feed
validator.org/ in your browser. Paste the URL
to your feed in the box and hit Validate. That’s it.
If your feed is valid, you get a nice message telling
you so — as well as a small graphic you can add to
your Web site if you choose. Figure 27-3 shows a
successful page, and Figure 27-4 shows when things
don’t go so well.

Submitting to
Podcast Directories
G
oogle and other search engines — it’s nearly impossible to navi-
gate without their assistance. However, tossing the word podcast
into a larger search engine and then trying to sift through the
results is the data equivalent of getting trapped in an avalanche. Even
tossing in some more accurate search terms will probably get you way
more than you bargained for. All you wanted was a podcast on (say)
Battlestar Galactica, and you’re snowed under by fan sites, pictures, and
all sorts of other information you weren’t looking for.
So nobody is ever going to lack for work in the vast job of trying to organ-
ize information on the Internet. Luckily, some intrepid souls have braved
the wilds and tried to bring some order to the world of podcasting. These
are the services that index and catalog podcasts — their goal is to bring
you the podcast titles you’re looking for without a lot of extra information.
You may have used them to find podcasts for your own personal listing
(as described in Practice 2), but in this practice, you’re going to join their
ranks and get listed yourself. It’s a simple process, and you’ll be surprised
by how many people can find your program through these guides.
Submitting Your Application
As with joining a club or getting a job, you have to apply to have your
podcast listed on a directory. Luckily, you don’t have to go through a
background check or submit a blood sample to make it happen. Podcast
directories want to have more podcasts listed in their ranks — it makes
them larger and more reliable, attracting more users to their sites (and
probably selling more advertisements). So they’ve made it as easy as
possible to get such things done. There’s a little information you’ll want
to have pulled together before you get started, but it’s a simple process.
RSS feed
More precisely, you’ll need the URL (online address) of your RSS feed to
continue from here. (If you need to refresh yourself on what an RSS feed
is before moving on, check out Practice 27.) By this point, you should

Show information
In this case, the directory is looking for the general
background information on your show (such as its
title and general focus), along with keywords (descrip-
tive terms about the program). The directory uses
keywords to help categorize your show and to help
others use the search-engine functions to find your
podcast. For example, if you were doing a podcast
about the Fountain Square neighborhood of
Indianapolis (it’s a small but loyal listener base), you’d
want to include tags about the subject’s location:

Fountain Square

Indianapolis

Indiana
You’d also want to include some keywords about the
features of the neighborhood:

Coffee shops

Live music

Restaurants

Hair salons

Art galleries

Wine bar

Real estate

Swing dancing
With the keywords in place, anyone using these
terms to search for podcasts is likely to run across
your podcast and give it shot.
You want to include as many descriptive key-
words as possible without lying or stretching
the truth. For example, even though gambling
and Paris Hilton are popular keywords on the
Internet, it wouldn’t be right to insert them
into your list of keywords just to lure in
unwary listeners. Directories can — and will —
eliminate directory listings for this kind of
misleading descriptions.
already have your feed up on your Web site or host-
ing service and validated. It’s the lifeline between
you and the directory, the only form of communica-
tion between your podcast and the service.
When you list a new episode on your feed, the direc-
tory picks it up from your feed and lists it on its
service. It also takes information from your feed,
such as the title and description of your podcast.
Some services may even have you insert metadata —
descriptive data that isn’t listed in the feed but read
only by the directory — in your feed to confirm your
ownership of the podcast or handle other adminis-
trative business.
iTunes contains tags that only its directory will
recognize. It’s a major directory, though, so
you’ll probably want to include some dupli-
cate information in your feed with different
tags to make sure you utilize all available serv-
ices. Check the instructions for iTunes when
adding information to your RSS feed to make
sure you’re using every possible advantage in
distributing your podcast.
E-mail and Web site
Most directories want to know the home base of the
show — but this doesn’t necessarily have to be the
exact location of your podcast’s host folder. Instead,
you’ll want to use your podcast’s Web site (your
podcast does have its own Web site, right?) so pod-
cast listeners can find you and communicate with
you. An e-mail address will help the directory keep
you up to date on what’s happening with their site
and provide current podcasting news.
If you don’t want this information to pop up in
your personal account, or if you want a sepa-
rate e-mail account to handle podcast busi-
ness, consider setting up a Webmail account
with a reputable online host such as Gmail or
Yahoo! Mail. That way you’ll still get the mes-
sages, but you can control when and how you
receive them.

Getting Listed in the Virtual Yellow Pages
239
The legitimate keywords you use should look
familiar — because, as a savvy podcaster, no
doubt you’ve already included them in your
RSS feed. Although some directories pull this
information straight from that feed, it’s a good
idea to enter your keyword info wherever
requested, just to be sure.
Getting Listed in the Virtual
Yellow Pages
Your proverbial ducks are in a row, and you’re ready
to submit your podcast to the masses waiting at
each directory service. Let’s just take a quick trip
through each service and see what you’ll need to do
to get your podcast listed.
iTunes
Due to the overwhelming popularity of iTunes and
the millions of people it has the potential to reach,
it’s extremely important to get listed on this service
if you want to reach a big audience. Luckily, it’s
quite easy to make iTunes aware of your podcast.
The iTunes folks will take a look at it and make sure
it’s up to their standards (that is, no technical diffi-
culties with the feed, no extreme pornographic con-
tent, no other such extreme stuff to cause trouble),
and they’ll list it if they’re satisfied. 
It can’t hurt to check the iTunes specifications for
podcasters at www.apple.com/itunes/store/
podcaststechspecs.
You’ll have to download and install iTunes
(www.apple.com/itunes) and sign up for
an iTunes account before submitting your
podcast.
Follow these steps to get listed with iTunes:
1.
Open iTunes and connect to the iTunes Music
Store.
2.
Click the Podcasts link in the store, as shown
in Figure 28-1.
• Figure 28-1: The podcast link.
3.
Scroll down to the bottom of the store and
click the Submit a Podcast link in the bottom-
left corner, as shown in Figure 28-2.
• Figure 28-2: Submitting a podcast.
The Submit Podcasts to the iTunes Directory
page appears (see Figure 28-3).
• Figure 28-3: Enter your podcast’s URL here.

Podcast Alley validates the feed and gives you
some code to add to your URL feed, as shown in
Figure 28-5. 
6.
Copy and paste the code into your RSS feed
and publish it to your site.
Figure 28-5 shows the on-screen instructions for
claiming a podcast.
• Figure 28-5: Adding code to claim your feed.
7.
Click Retry Claim to attach the podcast to your
membership. 
You’ll be able to edit information about your
podcast once this process is completed.
This claiming process may seem a little tricky, but
it’s important to do. When you’re done, you’ll be the
only one who can change your directory listing. (If
you need more information about editing RSS feeds,
refer to Practice 27.)
4.
Enter your feed URL and other information. 
The more information you can put in, the bet-
ter. It will help others find your podcast easily.
If the podcast is approved, it should appear in the
iTunes podcast directory within a day or two.
Podcast Alley
iTunes has podcasting features added to its normal
modes of operation, but podcasting obviously isn’t
iTunes’ main business. It’s like finding the music sec-
tion in a larger store as opposed to visiting a smaller
music-only retailer. In this case, Podcast Alley is that
small music store, dedicated to help you find what
you need — that’s all it does. By getting your pod-
cast listed on this directory, you’re targeting listen-
ers who want to find podcasts that may not be listed
in the mainstream directories — and they’re willing
to search to find them.
Follow these steps to submit your podcast to
Podcast Alley:
1.
Navigate to http://podcastalley.com.
2.
Sign up for your free membership — only
Podcast Alley members can submit podcasts.
3.
Click Add A Podcast.
4.
Add the URL for your feed, as shown in
Figure 28-4.

Podcast Pickle
Podcast Pickle is another podcast-centric service,
so you’ll be reaching dedicated podcast listeners
here as well. Why did they choose “pickle?” Don’t
know, but it works. Follow these steps to submit
your cast:
1.
Navigate to http://podcastpickle.com.
2.
Click Add Cast.
The Add Cast page appears, as shown in
Figure 28-6.
3.
Enter your feed URL, an overall genre, tags,
and a content rating for your podcast. 
Choices for the last category range from All
Audiences to Adult.
• Figure 28-6: Adding a podcast to Podcast Pickle.
Checking Directory 
Sites Regularly
Check your feed sites often and make sure that
they’re keeping up with your service. Broken feeds
or mislabeled tags can keep others from finding
your show. Some of these sites also have forums,
comments, and other community-based services
that help you network with other users and publi-
cize your podcasts. In any case, it’s a portal that 
represents your podcast to potential listeners —
and you need to keep on top of how it looks and
behaves. Check back early and often.
We’ve mentioned some of the larger podcast direc-
tories here, but there are about a hundred more to
examine. Keep your ears (and your Google searches
and your networking efforts) open to find more
places to list your podcast and get more listeners.
Some directories require you to put informa-
tion in your RSS feed to claim it; Podcast Alley
is one of those. Others have different authen-
tication methods. Whatever the method in
use, remember to take advantage of that
function. It’ll make managing your podcast’s
public image easier.
Be sure to set your hosting and RSS feed in
stone (so to speak) before submitting to pod-
cast directories. You’ll have a great deal of 
difficulty changing the directory listings later 
if you have to change the location of your
host or feed.

Building Your
Audience

Creating a
Promotional Plan
I
n previous practices in this book, we go deep into the final details of
creating your introductory episode, checking your feed to make cer-
tain it is working, and acquiring hardware and software that raises the
bar for your podcast. This practice, though, provides you with a blue-
print for letting people know about your podcast. Now comes the time to
map out a strategy for tooting your horn.
Publicity.
The podosphere is not the place to be humble. You have to talk yourself
up and let people know that a podcast is coming that is a must have. Even
if you are with a podcasting network such as FarPoint Media or Podshow,
people are not going to know where to find you or what your podcast is
all about unless you tell them.
You need to put together your teasers and promos — and then begin
planning a strategy for how to promote your podcast. Think first about
whom you want to reach; from there you can get the hype machine
underway. Get people talking — it’s a terrific way to have an audience
anxiously waiting for that introductory episode — and a solid motivation
to keep producing content. 
Deciding When to Begin Promoting
Your Podcast
Hype is a beautiful thing. It builds anticipation. It gets people talking. It
draws an audience.
The hardest thing about hype, though, is timing. You have to know when
to start it; otherwise, it goes on for too long, and people lose interest —
or are disappointed in the end result — or potential listeners are caught
off guard by the sudden release of a new podcast and don’t know of its
existence.

Two months? Is that some magic window of time, or
a standard in the podosphere? But what if you’re an
unknown? Two months, while feeling like a long
time, is an excellent and easily manageable cushion
of time. We recommend two months because —
between your promotional spots and sending out
press releases — you can generate a lot of chatter in
that time. As far as name recognition goes, podcast-
ers all start somewhere. Two personalities in the
podcasting arena, Christiana Ellis and Tony Mast,
both started promoting their podcasts (Nina
Kimberly the Merciless and Tony’s Losing It, respec-
tively) months ahead of their release dates. The end
results were strong subscription numbers (well
above the 500 and 1,000 listeners marks) that con-
tinued to grow after their premieres.
Examining two real-life promotional campaigns
Throughout this practice, we refer to Tee’s own
Billibub Baddings and The Case of The Singing Sword
podcast as a benchmark. Along the way, we spot-
light other successful hype campaigns for podcast-
ers (such as the podcast novel Crescent) and review
how their makers used time and hype to gather an
audience for the launch date.
Billibub Baddings
In December 2006, Tee released a teaser spot for
Billibub Baddings to some friends in podcasting.
They were taken aback that he was advertising a
podcast slated for mid-February (two whole months
away — yikes), but he assured them it would be
here before they knew it. Here was the two-month
game plan: 

In December, Tee’s request to podcasters he
approached was simple: Play the teaser —
and feel free to circulate this spot to other
podcasters — throughout the month. 

In mid-January, provided the podcasters he ini-
tially approached were okay with it, he would
release a second promo and have them play that
spot up to the launch date (February 14, 2007). 
A good example of a gamble in hype is The Lord of
the Rings franchise. Director Peter Jackson and New
Line Cinema went out on a limb and began promot-
ing the first film of the trilogy, The Fellowship of the
Ring, a year before its 2001 release. In the original
trailer, they also announced the subsequent releases
of The Two Towers in 2002 and The Return of the King
in 2003. This was an unprecedented move on the
filmmakers’ part because no one really knew how
the first film, coming from a relatively unknown cast
and an unfamiliar director, was going to do at the
box office — and they were advertising both sequels
alongside it!
Then The Fellowship of the Ring was released, and
raised the bar for filmmaking. Okay, that’s a large-
scale example. But it does illustrate that hype can
be an art form in its own right.
As much as you might love to be Peter Jackson (liv-
ing in New Zealand, hosting Sir Ian McKellen when
he’s in town, hanging out with Viggo and Orlando at
the pub . . .), you probably won’t spend a whole year
generating hype for your podcast launch. Instead,
consider promoting your upcoming podcast
between one to three months prior to release. This
window of time gets people talking and builds 
anticipation.
Building excitement prior to launch
To generate hype for your podcast, sure, you can
rely on word of mouth, but there needs to be more
to it than just friends talking up your desire to do a
podcast and a few random posts popping up on
your podcast’s blog. 
How about giving ’em an actual taste of your pod-
cast? When those first five episodes are in the can,
ready to post, you can take some time out and cut
two more episodes: a teaser and a promotional spot
(or promo). After you have those two spots —
preferably close to one minute in duration, with
neither spot exceeding two minutes — look at your
calendar. Give yourself two months to promote
before launching your podcast.

Why Promoting Before Episode #0 Is Beneficial
247
With two months of advance notice, Tee could now
have four weeks for each promotional spot to make
the rounds amongst friends (and throughout the
podcasting community). The two-month promo-
tional window gave weekly and bimonthly podcasts
a chance to promote the new podcast — and now
monthly podcasts could pick up the teaser and
promo to help in the hype.
Crescent
Another podcast that took advantage of a two-month
time frame to promote itself is Phil Rossi’s science
fiction/horror podcast novel, Crescent (http://
crescentstation.net), shown in Figure 29-1.
• Figure 29-1: Phil Rossi’s science fiction thriller, Crescent,
used short stories to build an audience for its
podcast launch.
Here’s how Phil’s campaign unfolded:

Phil’s blog launched in late January 2007 with
a simple graphic and a vague release date of
Spring 2007. 

His first promo was released February 6, fol-
lowed a week later by the first promotional
episode he entitled Crescent Vignettes. 

Over the following six weeks, Phil released a
short story related to the novel he was planning
to premiere (a podcast within a podcast). 

Finally, on March 30, Phil announced the release
date of Crescent’s first episode: May 3, 2007.
By mid-April, Phil had already garnered three
reviews on iTunes and well over a thousand sub-
scribed listeners, and the first chapter had not even
gone live.

Just on Podcast Pickle (http://podcastpickle.
com), over 12,000 podcasts are registered. On
Podcast Alley (http://podcastalley.com), over
31,000 podcasts are registered. No matter how you
look at it, no matter what directory you visit, the
podosphere is saturated with podcasts. There are so
many to choose from at present, and you are gearing
up to add just one more show to the roster.
There’s only so much time in the day, and so much
room on your mp3 player. It’s tough when a new
podcast comes out and the hype on the podosphere
is “You have to listen to it!”
Our practical answer is usually that we’d love to lis-
ten to it, but we need to know why we should listen to
it; and then we ask ourselves, do we have the time?
Giving an audience a reason — a really good reason —
to listen is the most important aspect of promoting a
podcast before Episode #0. By having five shows
ready to go, you know exactly how much work goes
into creating your podcast. By promoting the podcast
several months before its launch date, you can gauge
the audience size and make accommodations at your

or another service geared for podcasting. The initial
numbers may not be a dead-on accurate idea of how
many people will be listening, but you can estimate
the growth potential of the show.
Trailers, teasers, and talkbacks
Filmmaker Earl Newton understood the attention-demand-
ing nature of video and knew he had to come up with a
plan for his own video podcast, Stranger Things (http://
strangerthings.tv). He premiered his podcast on
February 1, 2007, with a one-minute movie-style trailer and
a simple three-minute episode with Earl reporting on the
status of his first film. Both episodes were shot in high-
definition video, and the status report announced that the
first Stranger Things episodes would be an adaptation of
Scott Sigler’s short story “Sacred Cow.” 
With these two offerings, Earl not only gave potential audi-
ences a look at things in the works, but also announced his
first project would be an adaptation of a work from one of
podcasting’s most popular names. Stranger Things now
had between February 1 and the release date of March 2
to get people talking — and in those few weeks, people on
the Net and in the real world did just that. After two
months, Stranger Things episodes had been downloaded
over 30,000 times, an impressive number for a video pod-
cast only a few months old.
Another benefit in getting the word out about your
podcast is that it gives the podcasting audience time
to consider whether your show appeals to them.
Does your podcast fit with their interests and their
schedules? 
This kind of promotion is key when you’re
video podcasting, because video tends to
demand undivided time and attention. It’s a
bit harder to multitask with a podcast on
because . . . well, when it’s video, you might
miss something. You have to watch. 
Give yourself at least two promotional spots to cir-
culate and two months to promote. If you decide
that you want more time to generate hype, have
content ready to submit to your feed. Whatever plan
you choose to follow, make sure you give yourself a
pocket of time. If your strategy plays out right, you
will already have a dedicated audience in place
before the first episode launches.
Would You Play My Promo
if I Asked Nicely?
The podosphere, as Rob Suarez mentions in his
Ink ’n Doodles Creative Workshop podcast (http://
inkndoodles.com), is all about community. We are
a community of audio enthusiasts, storytellers,
musicians, and imaginative individuals all coming
together to help one another get the word out about
each other’s podcasts.
At least that’s the theory.
In the early days of podcasting, you wouldn’t think
twice about accepting promos and playing them on
your podcast. With the number of podcasts steadily
growing, and audiences focusing their time, attention,

Would You Play My Promo if I Asked Nicely?
249
and aggregators on specific show categories, the
need for a strategy has grown as well. These days you
have to send that first promo or distribute the teaser
in a way that connects with some pretty specific
parts of the podosphere. The following sections give
you some tips for getting the word out.
Target podcasts that reach your target audience 
In your research on what other podcasts are out
there, which ones would make good references
beyond your podcast, or even which hosts are talk-
ing about the same subject matter, you should have
collected a few podcasts that reach the same audi-
ence you’re targeting. Find out where they’re
located on the Web and then drop these podcast
hosts a query. Ask if they welcome teasers and pro-
mos for other podcasts? Build a contact list and
make these podcasts your first wave of promotion;
they’re where you find the bulk of your audience.
Send promos only to podcasts 
that welcome promos
This idea may sound like common sense, but you do
want to practice a bit of tact and decorum when it
comes to asking people to promote your podcast.
For free. In the Billibub Baddings podcast, Tee offers
up an open-door policy to promos; but with the
Podcasting For Dummies Companion Podcast, he
can’t accept or play promos. There is nothing per-
sonal about that; the show just doesn’t lend itself to
featuring promos because its running time is short,
and it is being produced for another entity other
than himself. (Yes, that is Tee’s voice you hear on
Podcasting For Dummies, but the podcast itself
doesn’t belong to him personally. It’s a business
arrangement with the publisher.)
Not all podcasts are open to teasers and pro-
mos. It’s considered good etiquette to query
shows before sending them promo links or
mp3 files. Always ask before sending.
If you’re approached with a promo for another pod-
cast, find out whether this podcast is one you’d feel
comfortable promoting. If your podcast is focused
on family-friendly content, for example, running
teasers and promos for shows that feature adult-
oriented programming may not work for you.
When you run a promo, you are advocating
that podcast. You reserve the final word on
whether you run any promo. If you find that a
promo is too edgy for your tastes, ask the pod-
cast’s representative whether there’s a “clean”
or “general audiences” version of the promo.
There’s nothing personally offensive about ask-
ing for an edited spot or even choosing not to
play a promo — it’s a question of what works
and what doesn’t. This is your podcast, and you
should concern yourself with exactly what you
are suggesting to your listening audience.
Pay it forward
When you approach other shows with your teasers
and promos, make sure you return the favor by offer-
ing to play their shows’ promos. It only reflect posi-
tively on you as part of the podcasting community
when — after other podcasters show you the cour-
tesy and kindness to feature your promos — you fea-
ture their promos in your episodes. After all, it
amounts to two-way free advertising.
It’s a good trade-off, and if the podcast is a favorite
of yours, you can offer to play the promo repeatedly.
Regardless of what you do, however, always return
the favor in kind.
Invite other podcasters to 
help with your promos
If you invite other podcasters to help you promote
your podcast, make sure that you work around their
schedules. Do not demand too much of their time;
work with them to make the promotion suit their
needs. (For example, in a rough draft of a third
promo, one author asked for a rewrite, and we hap-
pily obliged.) And be sure to thank them — either
on your podcast or in promos featured in your
episodes.

Practice 29: Creating a Promotional Plan

Cast your promos out to wider audiences
Now that you have your target audience covered,
you can now consider other podcasts and demo-
graphics (you know — what we used to call “groups
of people with similarities”) beyond your first wave
of promotion. Here are a few ways to reach a wider
audience:

Register your promos with Podcast Promos
(http://podcastpromos.com), a directory
specifically geared for podcast teasers and
promos. 

Begin submitting your feed to directories and
then make your first offerings teasers and pro-
mos for your show — and offer them in your
feed to your subscribers. Many of your sub-
scribers will either be hosting their own pod-
casts or know people who host podcasts, and
will gladly feature your promotional spots in
their shows. 
Strictly business
For the Billibub Baddings podcast, Tee always features other
podcasts’ promos at the end of each episode. A space is also
reserved for paid promos in the middle of the show. A few
podcasters were taken aback by this standard, and voiced
puzzlement: “Well, I’ve been promoting Billibub quite liber-
ally in my podcast. Why can’t I be featured there?” 
This is another situation where business concerns call for a
delicate balance. No question that Tee appreciates the
mention in other podcasts and responds in kind. But a
standard has to be met here: When a podcast becomes a
business, putting free ads alongside paid ads would be bad
business — unfair to the paying clientele — so keeping the
two separate is a good idea. For that matter, never take the
placement of your promo personally. Regardless of where
it is in a podcast, it’s being played. That’s what matters in
the end.

Tell Me About It:
Recording Promos
and Quickcasts
“I
f you podcast it, they will come.”
Maybe that was true back in 2005, but since the great iTunes rush of
September 2005, the podosphere has become rife with podcasters, all
with their eyes on the iTunes Top 25 or an article in The New York Times.
There have been dynamic personalities — Scott Sigler, Ronald D. Moore,
Mur Lafferty, Steve Eley, Michael Geoghegan, Dan Klass, and Rob Walch —
blazing trails for future podcasters, inspiring them to get their names and
voices into the podosphere. With the competition for attracting listeners
(and keeping them) as fierce as it is, many current and would-be podcast-
ers go back to the trailblazers to try and figure out how they achieved
success.
The common link is quite simple with all these podcasters: They told
people about their podcasts.
What Is a Promo?
When podcasts are in the early stages of production (as discussed in
Practice 29), a promo is one of the first things planned out, along with
the first few episodes of the podcast itself. The reason a promo should be
thought out beforehand is that many podcasts start out of the box strong
with episodes, but they find themselves at a loss for words when other
podcasters contact them and ask, “Do you have a promo? I would love to
feature it on my show.”
A promo is exactly what it sounds like: a promotional spot (okay, a
commercial) for your podcast. It can be serious. It can be funny. It can
be self-deprecating. It can be whatever you want, but what it needs to be
is short.

The 1-minute-30-second promo: Are you sure
you want to say that much?
A promo extending beyond the one-minute ceiling is
usually frowned upon by other podcasters; breaks
between show segments usually last one to two min-
utes, and now this promo has (regardless if this was
the intent) monopolized a break segment, shutting
out any other potential podcasts.
When your promo breaks the one-minute ceiling, you
are going to want to step back from it and ask your-
self, “Is it too much?” That said, sometimes a promo
can dare the one-minute ceiling when the content
incorporates some special features:


The 30-second promo: Short and sweet
Thirty seconds may seem like a long time in front of
a microphone, but it’s over before it begins when
you record copy about your podcast and then
add bed music for atmosphere (as described in
Practice 20). Go on and sit in front of your micro-
phone for 30 seconds without saying anything. Now,
start recording yourself reading an introduction for
your show. You might be surprised how quickly the
time passes.
In a 30-second promo, you have time to mention
only the basics of a podcast: the who, what, and
where. Once that’s covered, you have a promo with
a running time that podcasters love — short, sweet,
and to the point. Promos also serve as quick and
easy drop-ins for breaks in a podcast. So if you
haven’t the time and space on someone else’s show
(either through a guest segment or interview) to
build up a joke or play extended clips from your
show, a 30-second creation is welcome because you
kept things short and quick.
The one-minute promo: Fun and informative
Some podcasters regard a promo lasting one minute
as a bit long, but on average, a one-minute ad for a
show is not out of the ordinary. One minute gives
a promo latitude for a more relaxed pace: You can
slow down when reading the copy, the music can
play a few seconds longer, and you can feature a
quick clip (or two) from previous shows.
When putting together copy (a script for your promo
that includes all the necessary information concern-
ing your podcast) for a longer promo, you need to
practice an economy of words. It’s all too easy to
wander off on tangents; keep the message of your
promo focused.
For example, Table 30-1 gives a breakdown of
the copy created for the podcast Give Us a Minute
(http://joemurphymemorialfund.org).


Multiple clips from previous episodes of the


Review quotes from other podcasters and from
authorities on the show’s subject
Provided your ad copy is engaging, doesn’t wander
off on too many tangents, and serves its purpose —
letting people know the who, what, why, and where
as detailed in the example in Table 30-1 — podcast-
ers will play the spot. But if you can cut the promo
down closer to the one-minute mark, it can earn
more airplay.
Why two minutes is too long
When promos reach two minutes of running time,
they are no longer promos but mini-podcasts in
themselves — or what some podcasters call quick-
casts (covered later in this practice). Instead of
serving as promotional spots for show breaks, the
promotion becomes a segment of the show itself.
And if the podcast hosting your promo is attempting
to keep its own running time under 20 minutes, this
epic promo size probably won’t be featured in a
show break. If you’re fortunate, it may appear at the
end of a show.
When it comes to promoting your show,
brevity is the soul of wit. Keep it short, be con-
cise, and let people know you’re out there.
My Name Is Tee, and This Is My
Podcast . . .
So what exactly do you say in a promo? Plenty of
podcasters have a lot to say about their topic of dis-
cussion, but they’re not sure where to begin when
cutting a promo for their show.
It can be a little daunting to let the world know that
you’re out there, podcasting your heart and soul. It’s
tough enough to ask yourself, “Is anyone listening?”
whenever you hit Record — and even tougher to tell
others, “Here’s why you want to listen. . . . “
Who you are
Yes, podcasters fail to mention in the podcast who
they are, and that’s very important to know. Who is
the captain of this ship, the man with the plan, the
femme fatale — who is the host of this podcast?
This is also your informal introduction of yourself to
the podosphere and a nice way to establish a con-
nection between you and your potential listeners.
What the podcast is about
If you decide to just stick with promos, the what
should be what your podcast is all about — for
example, you discussing the subject matter of your
podcast, or two people talking about the topic of
your podcast. An example of letting people know the
what can be heard in a promo for the Typical Mac
User (www.typicalmacuser.com) podcast: 
“ . . . check out the Typical Mac User podcast.
It’s got advice for switchers, reviews of differ-
ent Mac accessories, and all sorts of cool tips
for beginners and experts.”
Where listeners can find this podcast
Apart from the who in a promo, the where is essential
in a good promo because it communicates your pod-
cast’s location on the Web. Whether it’s a Web site
specifically for the podcast or a central Web site that
links people to the podcast’s location, you want to
make sure a URL of some kind is in the promo so that
people can find out more about the host (or hosts),
the show’s content, or its posting schedule.

Practice 30: Tell Me About It: Recording Promos and Quickcasts
254
“All proceeds raised by this podcast will go to
benefit the Joe Murphy Memorial Fund in its
ongoing battle against leiomyosarcoma.” 
While this is not commonly heard in promos, you
can mention the inspiration or drive behind your
podcast. It’s just a different way to promote
your production.
When promos become podcasts
In the same vein as the Geico “So Easy a Caveman Can Do It”
campaign, one of this title’s authors — Tee Morris — got an
idea while listening to two friends and popular podcasters —
Scott Sigler (The Rookie, Ancestor) and J.C. Hutchins (The 7th
Son Trilogy) — begin a light-hearted “turf war” on their respec-
tive podcasts. 
After listening to the two authors rib one another, Tee
decided it was time the creator of the podiobook showed
them who’s boss. He wrote a teaser and a promo depicting
the two in a café, taken down by the mob; and then later
bound and gagged in a remote location with the mob
interrogating them.
The two spots were long in their running time, but they
grew so much in their popularity that the spots spawned
two more promos and earned Tee a glowing review from
SFFAudio.com.
So don’t be surprised if a promo suddenly gets a life of its
own. It might even earn you a five-star review! Just as long
as it gets people talking (in a good way) and helps you pro-
mote your podcast.
What Is a Quickcast?
The quickcast is a new trend popping up in podcasts
everywhere. Quickcasts come in two sizes: a stand-
alone episode in the middle of a podcast’s season
or a podcast within a podcast. These quick-and-dirty
episodes usually run between five and ten minutes,
have very little editing or post-production, and sim-
ply make the announcement they need to make (no
tangents, no additional show segments, no opening
or closing credits).
Nina is such a tease!
In a promo, you let people know the details (within reason —
remember, it’s supposed to be short . . . ), but if you simply
give a who and a where (a Web site for the podcast), then
your promo becomes a teaser. A teaser hooks the listeners
just enough to get them to the Web site, and from there, the
hype begins to build. 
With dramatic music swelling in the background, voiceover
talent Scott Fletcher boldly proclaimed:
“She’s on a mission . . . To kill the man who loves 
her . . . Why? Because he’s an idiot. Nina Kimberly
the Merciless. Coming soon.”
Podcaster Christiana Ellis managed — in 15 seconds — not
only to get people talking but also to increase traffic to her
Web site. Her podiobook Nina Kimberly the Merciless
(www.ninakimberly.com) went on to top the charts at
Podiobooks.com and was a finalist for the 2006 Parsec
Awards and 2006 Podcast Peer Awards.
And sometimes, why . . . 
You have another option with your promo if you
think the time and the podcast warrants it: State in
brief why you are doing this particular subject mat-
ter. In the cancer-awareness podcast Give Us a

What Is a Quickcast?
255
Quickcasts are terrific sound bites for podcasts that
are on longer posting schedules (as opposed to fre-
quent ones). In the case of special developments in
the podcast’s direction, honors bestowed to the
host, or changes in the posting schedule, quickcasts
are a terrific device for getting the word out to sub-
scribers, assuring them that more is to come and
podfading (disappearance from the podosphere, as
discussed in Part VIII) is not an option.
The most common instances of quickcasts are seg-
ments of a podcast produced by a listener rather
than the host. This kind of listener-generated con-
tent makes production of an individual podcast
episode very easy, depending on the audio quality of
the quickcast recorded.
For example, after hearing a serialized short story on
Jack Mangan’s Deadpan Podcast (shown in Figure
30-1), Paul Maki contacted the show and asked if
there was any interest in serializing his novella,
Really Big Things. For the next four months, Deadpan
featured five-to-ten minute episodes featuring the
surreal adventures of two friends as they pho-
tographed oddities and road attractions across the
Midwest. Here the quickcast benefited both parties;
Paul could give both his novella and podcasting a
test drive, while Jack Mangan now had five to ten
minutes covered for his 30-40-minute show. The
quickcast, properly implemented, should be a true
synergy between the show and the content producer.
• Figure 30-1: Part irreverent comedy, part open-mic for
podcasting talent, Jack Mangan’s Deadpan
features podcasts within its own podcast.
The quickcast you produce should be the right
“fit” for a podcast. If you are reviewing anime,
for example, maybe a podcast on cooking
healthy would not be the ideal host for your
segment. But if you’re producing quick 
segments on how to cook outdoors, then food
podcasts or shows about the hiker’s lifestyle
may be interested in what you have to offer.
Before submitting a quickcast to a show,
always consider what you’re offering them.
Two-to-three-minute quickcast:
Welcome, friends!
The key to a good quickcast is keeping it short —
much like a promo. The other good news about a
quickcast in the two-to-three minute range is that
the playing field is wide open for other quickcasts.
Say you want to record a quickcast for the MacCast,
which will include a review of the iLap, a laptop
desk designed for the various incarnations of the
PowerBooks and MacBooks. Your basic quickcast
should follow this plan:

Introduction. “Hi, (name of showhost), this is
(your name) of (your podcast or your location in
the world), and I’m here to review the iLap.”

The content: Because this is a review, give a
brief description of the product and then go into
your opinions and final verdict.

Exit, Stage Left: “Thanks, (name of showhost),
for letting me contribute to (the host podcast).”

The optional plug: “If you would like to find out
more about what I do at (your podcast), check
out my show at (podcast’s URL).”
This plan assuredly yields a quickcast in the two-to-
three minute range. 
Before sending in your segment, contact the show’s
host and let him or her know you have produced a
segment and would like to submit it for consideration.
Never make the assumption that simply because
you’ve produced the segment, it will get played right
away. Always query a podcast’s host before sending
in the segment.

Practice 30: Tell Me About It: Recording Promos and Quickcasts
256
bit much. If you do want to drop in the plug, do
it here before your segment bids farewell.

Exit, Stage Left: “And that will do for this month’s
(name of segment). Take it easy, everybody!” and
then head out with your bumper music.
More planning tends to go into a five-to-ten-minute
podcast, but that stands to reason. You now have
more audio material to play with — and this seg-
ment is running the same length, if not longer, than
podcasts such as Aliens You Will Meet, The Myth
Minute, and even Podcasting For Dummies: The
Companion Podcast.
Be careful what you wish for
Halfway through the 2006 Season of Michael and Evo’s
Wingin’ It, show host Michael R. Mennega was complain-
ing far too much about how hard it was to produce
episodes because he found so little content and guest sub-
missions left in his e-mail “In” box. “Please, people,” he
begged, “if you have an idea or want to produce content,
send it to me! Please!”
Within a week, Mike received enough content to last him
for the remainder of the season . . . but the quickcasts con-
tinued to arrive!
The lesson learned here is that not only are your audience
members supporters of your podcast, but deep down
inside, they’re also curious about podcasting themselves.
Listeners are simply waiting for an invitation. What’s terrific
about these contributions is that they can become regular
segments for your podcast (“Uninvited Guest Editorials”
with Indiana Jim, “MicroBrewed,” “The MacCast Mac
Minute Tip”) or podcasts themselves (SciFi Smackdown,
A Different Point of View, or The One-Minute Tech Tip.)
Five-to-ten-minute quickcast: 
Proceed with permission
Many podcasts prefer to keep the content and the
delivery of the content short — that is, under
fifteen minutes total, ten minutes preferred. A quick-
cast of five to ten minutes may not be welcome
because it may take up a majority of the show’s lat-
est episode. Longer podcasts, however — such as
Jack Mangan’s Deadpan Podcast, Speaking of Beer,
and The ScapeCast — wouldn’t mind the content
running in this range, provided the parameters of
that content are clear and within the recommended
guidelines.
If you think the segment would be something you
could do on a monthly (or more frequent) basis, ask
the show host in your query if that is something that
would interest him or her. You may get a “Well, let’s
wait and see . . . ” response, or you might get the
open invitation to contribute. Whatever the out-
come, it’s a good idea to coordinate with the pod-
cast’s host and provide as much detail as possible
about what you’re planning to do.
A five-to-ten-minute quickcast may not seem as big a
deal as we’re making it out to be, but a lot of work
can go into it. Here’s the anatomy of a “regular
segment” quickcast:

Introduction: In this kind of quickcast, bumper
music (described in Practice 6) is a nice touch to
let listeners know your segment is coming up.
“Hey, everyone, welcome to (name for your
show’s segment), and this is (your name).”

The content: Here is where you deliver the seg-
ment’s main content. If it’s an interview, an on-
the-scene report, or simply a soundseeing tour,
give yourself five to seven minutes of content so
you have room to edit it if necessary.

The even-more-than-optional plug: Because
your time is limited and the quickcast is possibly
becoming a regular segment, a plug may seem a

What Is a Quickcast?
257
If you are invited to produce regular segments for a
podcast, another good idea for your production
planning is to record several episodes ahead. Get
as many segments recorded as possible and then
submit them to the podcast host. That way you’ve
met a “content quota” for the show. Make sure you
coordinate with the show’s host to see what kind of
schedule you’d like your segment to follow — twice
a month? Monthly? Find a schedule that works for
both of you.
By producing this quickcast, you’ve also created a
means for promoting your own podcast (or for giving
it a try before committing fully to your own show).
For the host, it’s instant “drop-and-play” content for
his or her host podcast. It’s a terrific relationship for
all parties involved.
Quickcast over ten minutes: Whose podcast is it,
anyway?
When you cross the ten-minute barrier, nothing is
“quick” about your quickcast. Your segment is waltz-
ing into the proverbial podcast’s home, double-
dipping the broccoli and pita bread across the
various dressings, and propping its now-bare feet up
on the coffee table, and changing the channel of
your television . . . after it unbuttons its pants and
sighs with contentment à la Al Bundy.
Any quickcast above ten minutes warrants an e-mail
to the show’s host. Perhaps it’s an opportunistic
interview with someone, an extended review of a
product or a series of products that would appeal to
the podcast’s listeners, or a dynamic soundseeing
tour of an event the podcast host is unable to
attend. In this situation, contact the podcast host
first — let him or her know the abnormal length of
the segment and ask what you can do that would
best fit the show’s needs. You have several options:

Edit the segment. The show host may ask you 
to edit the segment to under ten minutes. This
doesn’t mean to edit it to 09:59.99. Technically,
yes, that does make the running time under ten
minutes, but doesn’t it bother you when some-
thing is advertised as under $100 and the price
tag reads $99.99? Same deal. Edit the segment so
it’s comfortably under nine minutes (and if pos-
sible, under eight). If the show host has made
this request to you, it’s a gesture of good faith.

Offer it as a “Special Edition” podcast. All pod-
casters need a break now and then. If you pro-
duce the segment well enough, and you feel that
you and the host have a good working relation-
ship, offer this extended quickcast as a full-out
episode, or a “Special Edition” that can run either
in place of a regular show or in an available slot
later in the week after a normal show drops. This
opportunity is great for both segment producer
and podcast host; it gives the segment producer
a chance to fly solo and the podcast host a
breather.

Serialize the segment. The host may offer to
take control and serialize the segment into a
two- or three-part segment across episodes. This
compromise is good for both the show and the
segment producer, requiring only a little bit of
editing on your part.

Launch your own podcast. If you notice your
segments are getting longer and longer, harder
and harder to edit under the ten-minute mark, it
may be high time for you to consider launching
your own podcast. You are more than ready to
set up your own blog, get the RSS up to podcast-
ing par, and tag your episodes under your own
name. Even better, you have another podcast
host to help you along and even promote your
podcast. What a fantastic start!
Regardless of whether you choose to promote your-
self or your podcast through a quickcast, a promo, or
a series of promos, what’s important is to remember
that these segments should be short, concise, and

podcast, it should not monopolize a break spot —
nor should it ramble aimlessly for a minute (or
longer). If the quickcast is your promotional venue,
remember that it’s not all about you; it’s about work-

Advertising to
Attract Listeners
P
opular programs don’t just spring up fully formed on whatever
media they exist on, whether it’s television, radio, or the Internet.
You have to let people know when and where the program can be
found. Practices 32 and 33 look at networking and word-of-mouth routes
to publicizing your program. This practice, however, takes a look at the
old-fashioned method of advertising. Whether you buy space or trade it
out for other services, ads can be an effective way to let people know
about your podcast.
A Banner Day
By far, the most common form of advertisement on the Internet is the
banner ad, shown in Figure 31-1. This shorthand term encompasses all
forms of leased space on a site — from static images with links to their
advertised service to “rich” media involving Flash animation, sound,
or video. 
• Figure 31-1: Two sample banner ads.

page on which you’re advertising to your podcast.
Investing in some space on (say) an auto-parts site
is great for your racing podcast, but your podcast
on knitting probably won’t be helped much by
advertising on Dave’s Comic . . . er, Graphic Novel
Web site.
You can see money in a couple of ways from
these ads: 

CPC (cost-per-click): This method bases pay-
ment on the number or percentage of clicks —
that is, the action of actually choosing to click a
banner ad for more information.

CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions): This
method bases payment on how many thousand
times the banner ad is displayed on a page.
Money in Stereo: Audio Ads
You’re already producing an audio program, so the
prospect of putting together an audio commercial
for that program shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.
In effect, you’re creating a short podcast to tell peo-
ple why they should listen to your show. Broadcast
commercials are usually either 30 or 60 seconds
long, although you don’t have to feel as restricted to
that time if you’re selling to other podcasts. 
The commercial should include the following
elements:

A quick introduction to you and your show

The online location of the show

How often you update it

Any other information that might be helpful
Web sites sell space on their pages for these
advertisements so visitors to that site see the ads.
The hope is that people see the ads, click them, and
zoom to a page where they can see whatever is
being advertised. Each Web site has its own rules on
what kind of ads it hosts, but most of the cost is
determined by the characteristics of the ad.
Size
The size of a banner ad plays a big part in how much
it costs. Banner ads are usually measured in pixels,
and they can appear anywhere on the page.
Obviously, the bigger the ad, the more you pay.
Type of media
It takes a lot more bandwidth to transmit a rich
media ad such as a Flash animation or a video
insert. A simple image or animated GIF takes less
room, making it easier to pass along. As your ad
becomes more complicated and involved, expect to
pay more (for both developing and hosting the ad).
You should also be aware that loud, obnoxious ads
tend to turn off many users of the Internet, so it
might be best to go for a simple, clean ad that
communicates your message effectively.
Page views
Just like buying an ad for the Super Bowl costs more
than a 2:00 a.m. spot on the local cable outlet, buy-
ing an ad on pages that get thousands of page views
a day costs more than getting some space on your
cousin’s family home page. Depending on the num-
ber of people you’re trying to reach, be prepared to
spend more to buy more eyes (views of your ad). Be
sure that the site’s owners can back up their infor-
mation, though; there’s no use spending money on
empty promises. You also need to match the type of

Hitting the Streets
261
You can dress up the ad with appropriate music and
sound effects, but make sure they don’t overwhelm
its message. From there, the only limit is your imagi-
nation. Think of the commercial as a business card
for your podcast.
Keep in mind that other podcasters are usually will-
ing to trade promo spots — “I’ll play your commercial
if you play mine.” There’s no money involved, so the
price is right. You have to make sure, however, that
the commercial you’re trading for fits into your 
show — and that there’s room for it. If you do end
up paying for time, make sure you get exactly what
you pay for. You should know how often the spot is
played and where it’s featured in the program.
What you’re doing is real business at this
point — so get this information in writing and
make sure the other party lives up to its end
of the bargain.
Advertising in News
Publications
Podcasting is the newest of the “new” media found
on the Internet (at least, it is this week), but that
doesn’t mean you should ignore “old” media like
newspapers and weekly publications — especially if
a publication shares the same views and values you
do. A weekly music paper (for instance) would be a
great place to advertise your show on indie rock,
and a community newsletter is a great medium for
telling others about your community-affairs podcast.
Check with each publication about ad rates (usually
sold in sections of pages, from quarter page to a full
page). This option might not be as pricey as radio or
television advertising, but it’s still going to cost you.
You have to weigh the cost versus the benefits of
the ad.
It might also be a good idea to get an experienced
designer (on the publication’s staff or an independ-
ent designer) to make the ad for you. Graphics and
layout expertise can really benefit your ad, even if it
does cost a little extra. Again, remember to check
your budget and balance the cost of the ad versus
what you get out of it.
Hitting the Streets
All the methods we’ve discussed so far involve buy-
ing space. You can advertise in places for free, but
you’re going to have to pound some pavement to get
there. Many businesses, such as coffee shops or
music stores, allow people to post flyers for free. Of
course, you still have to pay to have the flyers made
(and that designer could come in handy here, too),
but you won’t have to pay to get them out there. Be
sure to follow each establishment’s rules for posting
(no holes in the wall, no tape that could peel paint,
and so forth), and don’t ever cover up another flyer
with your own. That’s just bad form.
Finally, you can always pass around flyers and busi-
ness cards, or even something like a bookmark or
other token, by hand. Checking out events that
might hold a great number of potential fans (say,
standing outside Heinz Field to advertise your
stellar Pittsburgh Steelers podcast) is a good idea.
Be prepared to stand outside for a while — and to
get rejected several times. Still, this approach has
worked for lots of folks; the fans you could pick up
from this activity can add up quickly.

Networking with
Other Podcasters
and Bloggers
W
hen you’ve published a podcast, you’ve joined a legion of millions
who are publishing their content on the Internet. Okay, we have
no doubt that yours is a wonderful program — but your show
still joins a vast wave of other content coming from people who are in
much the same place you are: part of a larger collective. The problem is
that your show stands alone without contact with others, and the
Internet is based on links. You’ll be able to learn so much more about cre-
ating and distributing podcasts by communicating with others who do
the same thing — just like any other activity — and the more people you
communicate with, the more new and different ways you find to make
your podcast better. You’ll also set up more ways for people to find and
download your show, as well.
Communicating with Others in a Forum
One of the most ubiquitous features of the Internet is the forum, also
known as the messageboard. It may look different in every instance you
see, but the common feature is that it allows people with similar interests
to communicate across great distances, different times, and sometimes
without any respect to decency or civility. Once you’ve gotten past those
jokers, though, you’ll find that you can make some excellent connections
through these services. The vast majority of them are free, too.
Start in a place you’re probably already familiar with — the forums on
many podcasting networks. (In this case, we take a look at the message-
boards located on Podcast Pickle.) You usually have to have an account
to post on the forums.
Podcasting forums are a good place to start networking and learning,
but don’t limit yourself to just those forums. It’s a good (nay, a stellar)
idea to talk to people interested in the podcast’s subject matter and let
them know about your show. You’ll find a lot more listeners and ideas
for shows that way. Some forums may allow anonymous posting, but
remember that you’re trying to network here. How are you going to
make connections if nobody knows who you are?
32
Practice

Communicating with Others in a Forum
263
After you sign up for an account with Podcast
Pickle, click the Forums link up at the top (as shown
in Figure 32-1) to get to the messageboards. Most
sites have their Forums links on the front page for
easy access.
• Figure 32-1: The Forums link on Podcast Pickle.
On these forums (see Figure 32-2), you can read what
others have posted, post something yourself, or
reply to any comments people may have made. It’s
helpful if you think about this as a conversation —
albeit one left like a series of notes on a wall some-
where. Each person leaves a note for the next, the
previous posters come back and add to the discus-
sion, and pretty soon you’ve got some communica-
tion going.
• Figure 32-2: The Podcast Pickle Forums.
The rules here are kind of like any other conversa-
tion you might have. It’s impossible to interrupt
somebody when they’re typing, so don’t worry
about that. You do still want to be respectful and
open in your discussion, however. Nothing derails
communication like inappropriate or out-of-place
language.
Listen (or read) up!
Whenever you take a look at a forum for the first
time, it’s a good idea to read some posts to get a feel
for how the current participants post and interact.
You’ll find out how the community acts around
each others’ posts, and you’ll also get an idea of
what topics people are currently talking about.
Although you’ll be able to see how each conversa-
tion started, you might not be able to see all the
history between the posters. You may notice some
recurrent conflicts or partnerships, and it might be
a good idea to make a note of those as you jump in.
Get all the information you can before you start —
it’s always a good idea, really.
Search for a common topic before posting
If a forum has been around for a good deal of time,
it’s probable that a slew of the normal beginners’
questions have been answered. Furthermore, most
of these forums have their own personal search
engines (like mini-Googles) to look for topics or sub-
jects that have already been covered. Before you ask
about what might be an oft-covered topic, run a
quick search — see whether what you want to know
(“What’s your favorite podcast mic?”) might already
be waiting for you among the FAQs. You’ll save your-
self a lot of time (and retain some goodwill from
messageboard denizens) with that one step.
Offer a quick introduction
The first time you post, you’re basically anonymous.
Unless you’ve met the participants somewhere else
before (on- or offline), you’re basically striking up a

Practice 32: Networking with Other Podcasters and Bloggers
264
Taking it from there
Now that you know what to avoid, jump in and start
talking. Most posters to podcasting forums have
information about their podcasts in their profiles, so
you’ll be able to find people pretty quickly who are
addressing topics you want to know about. Don’t be
afraid to talk to podcasters with different interests,
though. The subject might be different, but the
medium is the same.
Contacting the Authors Directly
You’ve already discovered how to search out other
podcasts through directories in Practice 2, and there’s
always the magic of Google and other search engines
(how DO they find all those pages?). It’s amazingly
easy to find other podcasts and podcasters (as well as
bloggers) who share your interests. Because they all
have pages, they’re almost guaranteed to have ways
for you to contact them, from direct e-mail addresses
to automated message forms. Those conveniences are
free to use, and they wouldn’t be there if the author
didn’t want you to use them.
It’s always a good idea to lead with some praise
(“Hey, I saw your blog and really like it. Nice work!”),
and questions are usually welcome as well (“Where
did you find that Gamera keychain mentioned in last
week’s post?”). If you want to try a more busi-
nesslike approach, you might propose an exchange
of links so readers and listeners of one site might
find the other, and vice versa. It’s a good idea to
make sure that they have a list of links or a blogroll
(a list of favorite or often-read sites) before recom-
mending such a transaction (see Figure 32-3). Links
can be like currency, though, so most authors are
willing to share.
More than anything, remember that you’re trying to
build a network and make connections with fellow
podcasters. It’s always good to have a link, but a
trusted contact can be even more valuable.
conversation with a bunch of strangers. Use the
same amount of care you would with that instance
here on the messageboards. It might also be a good
idea to give a little bit of background with your first
post (like your name, your location, your podcast
title, and how long you’ve been doing this) so people
know where you’re coming from. Some forums also
have newbie forums where you can introduce your-
self in your own first post and get it out of the way.
Respect yourself and others
If everybody could express themselves completely
and utterly through text, everybody would be
Hemingway. As it is, it’s sometimes difficult to prop-
erly communicate subtleties like sarcasm through
the written word. Until you’ve gotten the hang of
writing on forums, it might be a good idea to avoid
extreme levels of snark. It’s easier to establish a
good reputation by being helpful, friendly and
knowledgeable than it is to repair a damaged image
on the forum.
Spam isn’t just for dinner
First it was junk mail and inconveniently timed
phone calls from telemarketers. Today’s most
annoying communications take the form of spam
e-mail and posts. It’s bad form to cover the forums
with notices about your podcast and your podcast
only. People come to forums to meet people with
similar interests and exchange knowledge and
information (and, yeah, sometimes write scathing
reviews of whatever springs to mind). That dialogue
isn’t helped by anybody virtually shouting “HEAR
MY PODCAST! HEAR MY PODCAST NOW!” It’s
acceptable to mention your experiences with your
podcast and discuss ways to handle possible prob-
lems. It’s not okay to spam the boards and clog the
lines of communication.
Avoid the spam and you’ll be okay. That
advice works on so many levels, really.

Questions and Comments
265
• Figure 32-3: This blogroll includes some links to fellow
podcasts.
Questions and Comments
When you first listen to a podcast or read a blog,
you may get a full listing of all available episodes or
stories. If you click a specific story or episode title,
though, you might see a place where fans can leave
comments or questions about each entry. Go ahead
and communicate with the author through these
sections — they make it possible to carry on a decent
conversation and learn a lot about the podcaster’s
craft. You can also link to these stories in your own
podcast or blog. It’s all about establishing links.
You might also hear about trackbacks or linkbacks,
an automated form of communication between two
online sites. If both Web sites support this feature,
you can use it to provide automatic summaries of
stories and comments exchanged between the sites.
This feature only works between blogs that both
support it, however, so don’t count on it being a
common feature in all your discussions.
The same rules about messageboard posts
apply here as well: Make sure you’re courteous
and clear in your communication, and don’t
use another person’s comment section to
advertise your own show. Go in and show your
good intentions, and you’ll get more out of it.

raditional radio uses (well, yeah) radio and television ads, bill-
boards, and the like to get you to listen to their shows. And sure,
ads can help (that picture sure shows how wacky that morning zoo
is, doesn’t it?). But even more effective is getting friends to tell their
friends and get them to listen to the show themselves. A billboard is, at
best, just an impersonal plea to listen — and at worst, a blight on an
otherwise-impressive landscape. By contrast, a friendly word from some-
one you like or respect (or two hours in a locked car being forced to
listen to a show) is much more influential.
In the brave new world of the Internet, it’s possible to get a note from
anywhere in the world about a show from anywhere in the world. There’s
just too much information — and programs available — to go through all
of it yourself, so the recommendation of a friend becomes even more
valuable. That word is likely to come through popular social Web sites,
where people come to meet and exchange information. These are sites
you can use to your advantage and make your podcast spread to a wider
audience.
Getting the Word Out through Social
Networks
The biggest advantage of using most social-networking resources is that
they’re free. You can set up a site on just about every network at no cost
to you. From there, you start sending out the notices and forging the con-
nections that will get your site recognized. From there, hopefully you’ll
see a chain reaction that spreads the word about your podcast to the far-
flung reaches of the Internet.
Bulletins, blogs, and comments
Take a look at the functions on MySpace — most social networking sites
have similar features, but MySpace sees the most traffic, so it’s definitely

the best place to start. You may even already have
an account on the site. If you don’t, it’s free, so
there’s no excuse. Hop to it.

check out MySpace For Dummies, published
by Wiley Publishing.
Bulletins
There are a few ways to notify people about your
podcast through MySpace (http://myspace.com).
The first is by bulletin. This feature sends out an
immediate notice to everybody on your friends list.
On your profile’s main home page, look for the link
under the My Mail section to post a bulletin, as
shown in Figure 33-1.
• Figure 33-1: The Post Bulletin link.
From here, you just type your message in the Post
Bulletin page, shown in Figure 33-2, and click the
Post button. Be sure your bulletin carries all the
pertinent information about your podcast, including
the location of the files and feeds, the main Web site,
how often you post updates (you DO post regular
updates, correct?), and a little about the podcast’s
subject matter.
Post Bulletin link
• Figure 33-2: Writing your podcast bulletin.
Bulletins on MySpace tend to move quickly,
especially if you have a lot of friends. Be pre-
pared to post bulletins early and often.
Blogs
MySpace pages also carry their own blogs with
RSS feed capabilities. (See Practice 27 for more
on RSS feeds; blogging is covered in detail in
Practice 26.) If you’re already familiar with blogging
and RSS feeds, then you’re ready to start using
these simple controls:
1.
Click the Blog link at the top of your home
MySpace page.
2.
Click the Post New Blog link in the My Controls
section of the page, as shown in Figure 33-3.
• Figure 33-3: Posting a new blog with the supplied

3.
Enter the subject of your blog and change the
Category drop-down menu to whatever is
appropriate for your entry.

Practice 33: Spreading the Word with Social Media
268
Comments
Another way to publicize your podcast is by leaving
comments on people’s pages. Not only does this let
the recipient know about your podcast, but it also
tells anybody who happens to visit that person’s
page as well. That said, it’s extremely rude to leave
multiple comments about the same thing in the com-
ment section — that’s called comment spam, and it’s
frowned upon; it amounts to cluttering up some-
body else’s profile with your own mess. It’s better to
tailor an individual comment to that person and not
to include all the promotional material you’d nor-
mally put in a blog or bulletin.
To add a comment, just look for the Comments sec-
tion on a profile and click the Add Comment button.
In the form shown in Figure 33-5, for example, you
enter your text and link and click Post a Comment.
• Figure 33-5: Adding a comment.
Your comment’s recipient may have enabled
the option to approve comments before
they’re posted, so try not to be too self-
serving with your post. It’s entirely possible
that your “OMG! GO LISTEN TO MY POD-
CAST NOW!!!” calling card will never see the
light of day if it’s phrased pretty much like
that.
A MySpace site for your podcast
So far, we’ve looked at using your own site to pro-
mote your podcast. Why not give your podcast its
own MySpace site, though? As mentioned before, it’s
free. Using a MySpace site for your podcast allows
people to search directly for the podcast in the
MySpace search directory, instead of looking for you
and getting it the roundabout way.
• Figure 33-4: Tell them what your blog is about.
4.
Enter the information about the podcast in
the body of the blog (it’ll be similar to what
you put in the bulletin), and include optional
information below the body section, if it seems
relevant.
5.
Include a link to the specific podcast episode
(not to the RSS feed) in the Podcast Enclosure
section of the blog entry. 
The link to the episode is added to the MySpace
RSS feed.
The podcast enclosure function should only
be used as an additional resource, and not as
your primary feed. You’ll still need to host
your own files, and you’ll get more tracking
information (who is downloading your pod-
cast, how many people, and so forth) from
your primary feed. This is for promotional
purposes only.
6.
When you’re finished click the Preview & Post
button to save your changes.

Using Bookmarking to Promote Your Podcast
269
It does mean you’re going to have to maintain two
different sites, so it will be a little extra effort. Still, it
does provide a more precise focus for promoting
your podcast, and you can restrict your bulletins
and blog entries to the podcast. That also means
that you can save your own profile for leaving funny
cat pictures in comments for your friends and avoid
besmirching the podcast’s reputation. (Hey, it
deserves better — right?)
Video sites
If you’ve got a video podcast (and don’t mind shar-
ing it on free video services), consider tossing it up
on YouTube (http://youtube.com) or another free
hosting service. The advantages of taking this step
include putting your video in a searchable database
(like a podcast directory) and taking a little strain
off of your bandwidth. People will also be able to
copy code directly from the site and embed it in
their MySpace or personal Web pages, further
exposing your work to the world.
To upload video to YouTube, follow these steps:
1.
Sign up for an account.
2.
Click Upload Video and verify your e-mail
account.
3.
On the Video Upload page, shown in Figure 33-6,
fill out the information about your video, includ-
ing the all-important tags.
Tag early, tag often.
4.
Choose the video to upload. 
It must be less than 100MB in size and 10 min-
utes in length.
Be sure to include mention of your main site and
feed in your video podcast for promotional pur-
poses. Remember, you’re posting it on YouTube to
attract more people to your RSS feed and site.
You should also consider other similar social net-
working sites such as Facebook (www.facebook.
com) and Virb (http://virb.com). They’re all pos-
sible additional sources of audience members.
• Figure 33-6: YouTube video options.
Using Bookmarking to Promote
Your Podcast
Think of social bookmarking sites like Internet-
acceptable graffiti. You’re tagging your favorite sites
with your endorsement, and other people can see
you’ve been there (and that you like the site). It also
allows you to store your bookmarks online, so you
can see them from any computer you use. In this
case, though, it’s more interesting to show how to
use these bookmarks to promote your own podcast.
Two popular services are StumbleUpon and
Del.icio.us. Both sites require log-ins, but this
profile is what allows you to centrally locate your
bookmarks and make them available to others.
All you need is an e-mail address and some basic
information.
Follow these steps to bookmark your podcast:
1.
Navigate to http://stumbleupon.com and
click Join StumbleUpon. 
The sign-up page appears, as shown in
Figure 33-7.

Practice 33: Spreading the Word with Social Media
270
Not only does this mean your friends will be able to
see the podcast link in your bookmarks, but also that
those searching for podcasts or sites with the same
tags as yours (using the random Stumble button in
the toolbar) will have a chance to find your podcast.
Del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us) also functions as
a way to tag Web sites for others to examine. The
sign-up screen, shown in Figure 33-9, is similar to
StumbleUpon, and this site only puts two links into
your regular browser toolbar (although there is a
separate Firefox extension if you choose to use it).
• Figure 33-9: Del.icio.us installation.
One of your new bookmarks allows you to tag your
interesting sites (such as your podcast), and the
other allows you to review your bookmarks and use
the Del.icio.us search engine to find similar tags (as
described in Practice 2). You can also set up links to
your friends and start networking. After you post a
link to Del.icio.us, as shown in Figure 33-10, you’ll be
able to add tags and descriptors, and you’ll have the
option of informing your network about these links.
Once your podcast had been bookmarked, friends of
the friends you’ve linked to can examine that list and
hear it for themselves. It gets added to other lists,
more people see it, and the process continues. It’s an

Virtually Promoting 
Your Podcast
Here’s a wild new wrinkle on social networking:
What if the word-of-mouth you’re spreading belongs
to a pixilated avatar you created in Second Life? Hey,
it could happen. Just because the podcasts take
place in the real world, separated from your online
avatars and characters, doesn’t mean you can’t tell
people about them. Of course, this approach can be
an expensive proposition — it involves maintaining
a premium account and virtual land in Second Life
or in online games — but simple conversations and
posted ads can help people find your site. Talk it up,
no matter what land you’re in.

hy do you podcast? Is it for money? Fame? Accolades from your
peers? To give back to the world and help shift the balance
toward the greater good? If you’re like many podcasters, the
answer to all of those is, “No, none of that, just doing this to communi-
cate.” That means the currency we trade in is called FEEDBACK. In this
practice, we discuss the various forms of feedback listeners can provide
you — and how to make the most of their comments to enhance your
show.
But a word of caution before we show you this particular peek behind
the closed doors of the sausage factory: Everyone is entitled to his or
her opinion, but you’re not obliged to go along with it; you can take it or
leave it at your own discretion. Remember that only a very small sub-
section of your audience will ever provide you with feedback — the vast
majority of your listeners just listen passively, in varying degrees of hap-
piness. Are the comments you receive indicative of the opinions of your
audience at large? Or do they represent the lunatic fringe? You’ll need to
think about those two questions long and hard before making any lasting
changes to your show based on the sparse and sporadic comments that
come in from out there. Let’s get started.
Is Your Show “Feedbackable?”
(Hey, if that isn’t a word, it ought to be — it means a show that attracts
feedback easily.) What if you made a podcast and nobody cared? That’s a
pretty big issue for many podcasters — and has caused more than one
show host to contemplate premature podfading (disappearing from the
podosphere). You can hear them from time to time, lamenting the lack of
audience response, nearly begging for someone — anyone — to send
them something — anything — to let them know someone is out there lis-
tening. But the hard reality is that all shows are not created equal in the
eyes of the listening audience — and that there is no direct correlation
between audience size and volume of feedback.

Encouraging Your Listeners to Provide Feedback
273
Think about all the times during your day you have
the chance to provide feedback to others. How often
do you do so? And when was the last time you filled
out a comment card for a service that was 100%
acceptable? If it was more recent than we’re giving
you credit for, did you fill out anything beyond the
required “circle this” rating system? As a culture, we
expect things to be okay. Barring the extremes of
service, we accept that we’re going to have a pleas-
ant experience and, at the most, may offer a polite
“everything was fine” if we’re asked how everything
was. (See if you don’t catch yourself doing that very
thing the next time you go out to dinner and the
server asks how your meal was.)
The same holds true in podcasting. People need a
reason to provide feedback. If the content of your
show does not cater to one of those reasons, you
shouldn’t expect to get a lot of feedback. Here are a
few reasons people will provide feedback:

To praise

To criticize

To debate

To correct

To ask questions of

To provide answers to
Now consider the last podcast you produced. Unless
it was a monumental improvement or a horrible fail-
ure compared to your other episodes, you probably
shouldn’t expect a lot of praise and criticism. (If you
aren’t putting forth controversial topics, by and large
don’t count on praise.) If you’ve done your home-
work, the fourth reason — to correct — shouldn’t
happen very often. The last two — asking questions
and providing answers — are more common, though
they vary from show to show depending on format
and the style of the hosts.
Even the most feedbackable shows see only a
small fraction — around 1–2 percent — of their
audience providing feedback. This is especially
true as the size of your audience grows.
Remember that listening and watching remain
for many a passive medium. Podcasting is
changing that, but not to the point where half
(or even a quarter) of your audience will call in
to your show each week. 
Remember that where feedback is concerned, there
is no magic bullet; some shows simply don’t entice
listeners to provide feedback. This isn’t necessarily
a bad thing. Take a hard, objective look at your
show — and set your feedback expectations accord-
ingly. If you think you should get more or would like
to get more, read on.
Encouraging Your Listeners 
to Provide Feedback
Let’s look at this as a simple cost/benefit analysis
situation. Your listeners will expend a certain
amount of effort (cost) to provide you with feed-
back. Even the most altruistic of your listeners do so
because they get some sort of reward (benefit) for
their trouble — even if that reward is simply the
feeling they get from a selfless (?) act. Unless you’re
giving away money or prizes, there isn’t a lot you
can do to increase the benefit side of the equation.
Instead, your power to encourage feedback lies in
lowering the barrier to entry. The following sections
discuss how to encourage listener input via e-mail,
voicemail, comments, and forum posts.
E-mail
E-mail is arguably the most ubiquitous application
made possible in the information age. It remains the
killer app and is, for many, the main and preferred
method of communication. With such a high rate of
adoption (who doesn’t use e-mail?), e-mail should be
the #1 way people communicate with the podcasts
they listen to. But it rarely is — usually because of
shortcomings on the side of the podcaster.

Practice 34: Soliciting and Incorporating Listener Feedback
274
So why do so many podcasters have 206
numbers for their voicemail? Because many of
them use the free voicemail service from
K7.net. There are many providers, but K7.net
got the jump on the competition when some
big-name podcasters started using its service.
Plus, K7.net used to provide free vanity num-
bers. It doesn’t any longer, but many podcast-
ers have stuck with them.
One word of caution: K7 numbers expire if
you don’t get a call for 30 days, and you can’t
get the number back. So be smart: Set up a
reminder every 20 days or so to give yourself
a call.
Voicemail numbers also have the advantage of van-
ity numbers, providing a catchy mnemonic device to
help listeners remember the number in case they
can’t hit the Pause button fast enough. If your voice-
mail provider doesn’t offer this service and you
aren’t getting many (if any) calls, consider research-
ing other services.
As with e-mail, it’s important to put your voicemail
number in front of your listeners at the right time.
Because calls can be initiated by most listeners as
they are listening to the show, go ahead and place it
somewhere obvious — say, adding it to the NAME tag
in your media file. This causes the number to scroll
across the track display of most media players —
whether portable or on-site. 
Comments on your blog
If you use a blog to power your podcast, the blog-
ging software you use probably gives listeners a
very easy way to attach comments to the show
notes of your podcast episodes. And if your blogging
software doesn’t do that, dump it and read Practice
26 for a great replacement suggestion.
Listeners tend to be more comfortable leaving com-
ments about an episode rather than sending e-mail
or leaving a voicemail. This isn’t all that surprising;
the listener loses a bit of privacy when e-mailing or
leaving a voice message. Both are easy to reply to,
and folks are concerned about their privacy. But a
Getting your listeners to send you e-mail relies on a
single factor: making your e-mail easily accessible to
them when they need it. Here are a couple ways you
can do that:

Display a Send Me Comments on This Episode
link on your Web site. People enjoy most pod-
cast episodes when they are sitting at their com-
puter. You probably have enabled some sort of
Flash player on your Web site to allow for that.
Place a Send Me Comments on This Episode link
right next to that Flash player. Don’t bury your
e-mail address on a Contact Us page or hide it
behind a form that they have to go digging for.

Say your e-mail address out loud during your
podcast. And for the listeners who are taking
advantage of the portable nature of podcasting —
how are you helping them to send you e-mail?
Kudos to you if you’re saying your e-mail address
out loud in your show. Extra bonus points if you
say it more than once. But how many times are
you waiting with pen and paper while you listen
to podcasts? True, there’s nothing stopping
someone from hitting Pause and tracking down
the items you mention — nothing, that is, except
for the 37 other podcast episodes in the player
waiting to be listened to.
Of course you should repeat your e-mail address in
your show. Of course you should spell it out and
speak very slowly. But you are probably better
served by encouraging your listeners to visit your
Web site for contact information — and by making
sure that contacting you is as easy as possible.
Voicemail
Ah, voicemail — the application that makes so many
listeners wonder why all these podcasters have phone
numbers in area code 206 (Seattle, WA). Voicemail
works well with podcasting for a couple of reasons:

Much of the podcast listening audience has a
phone strapped to a hip most of the time. 

Talk radio has trained us all to pick up the phone
and call rather than wait until we get home to
pen a letter.

Encouraging Your Listeners to Provide Feedback
275
comment on a post on a Web site? That allows for
true anonymity.
Or does it? If you have a feedbackable show but
aren’t getting many comments on your posts, it
could be because your listeners perceive a privacy
issue where there doesn’t have to be one: Most com-
ment systems ask for, but do not require, an e-mail
address and a Web site URL. How inviting is that?
(Hint: not very.) Many smart podcasters have
hacked their sites’ comment templates to add “not
displayed on site” or remove the fields altogether.
Decide what’s right for you.
Barring that little hassle, site-side comments are
usually quite prominent and rarely need extra posi-
tioning. But you can encourage comments on your
site just by asking. And when you ask for visitors to
leave comments, tell them all the other things they
can find on your site, like an archive of past shows,
links to additional content, or perhaps your upcom-
ing schedule of appearances. More reasons to visit
means more benefit to them.
Forum posts
Okay, people do like to carry on conversations
inside forums — but those conversations tend to be
the least-effective way of gathering comments about
a specific podcast episode. With e-mail and voice-
mail, the experience is one-on-one between the lis-
tener and the podcaster. With Web-site comments,
the activity is a bit more social — but comments can
(and do) live alone, isolated from others of their
kind. All that is out the window in a forum post.
Forums are places where conversations develop and
change significantly after the initial thread is posted.
They are notoriously difficult to control and many
are dominated by powerful figures, sometimes to
the detriment of others. 
None of this is necessarily a bad thing, you under-
stand. It just depends on your audience and your
show’s ability to nurture compelling conversations
beyond the relative merits of a single episode.
Because forums allow your listeners to respond
more easily to one another than with blog com-
ments, forums can foster a much greater sense of
community. 
There is, however, one bad thing about forums:
They present nearly irresistible targets for
script-kiddies and vandals. Many exploits
for the most common and widely used appli-
cations exist; some of these, after they estab-
lish themselves, allow a hacker access to the
entire Web server. This can bring everything
to a screeching halt very quickly and make it
nearly impossible to recover deleted assets.
Sometimes those assets may be your entire
database of posts and threads. You have been
warned.
One podcast of note, Escape Pod (http://escape
pod.org), has found great success using forums
and has suffered none of the bad juju we’ve dis-
cussed here. Steve Eley uses Simple Machines
Forum (http://simplemachines.org) and hasn’t
had a single spam post or exploit since rolling out
the application. 
If you intend to use a forum, it’s a good idea to 

Keep tabs on the conversation. Not necessarily
to make sure everyone plays nice, but to let your
listeners know that an entirely new facet of your
program exists. Everyone probably gets the con-
cept of “leave us a voicemail.” But a forum offers
many more opportunities for a conversation
to develop. Make sure you are fostering that
conversation — and a sense of community.

Use your show to talk about the conversations
that are developing on your forum. Also, men-
tion your most prolific posters and work some
comments about their contributions into your
podcast.

Try to funnel as much traffic to the forum
as possible. As with all forms of feedback, if
people don’t know about it, they can’t use it to
participate.

Practice 34: Soliciting and Incorporating Listener Feedback
276
Why add discussion about the feedback at all?
It’s true that some podcasts will simply string
voicemails and audio comments one after
another without adding any reciprocal feed-
back from the show hosts. At the risk of gen-
eralization, this seems a bit narcissistic. The
idea behind feedback is to respond to the
feedback, even if it’s a simple thank you — if
you don’t see the value in adding your two
cents about the feedback, then your audience
probably doesn’t care to hear that either. 

Read an e-mail or a pertinent forum post on
your show. If possible, see if you can track down
a friend or co-worker to voice the feedback text
for you. While this isn’t required, the new voice
on the program will help provide a clear distinc-
tion between the feedback and your comments.
Managing feedback overload
But what do you do when the amount of feedback
turns from a trickle to a deluge? Chances are that your
audience is choosing to listen to your podcast to hear
your main content, not the comments from other lis-
teners about your content. You have to keep good
control over how much feedback you add to your
show, lest you change the nature of your program.
The best way to achieve this balance is by selective
addition of feedback:

Receiving a voicemail comment does not obli-
gate you to play the comment. (Remember, how-
ever, the previous suggestion about the positive
feedback loop.)

You may wind up with several comments on a
topic that by and large offer up the same view-
point. Select one of these to play on your show,
but mention that many more just like this came
in if you feel it necessary. 
You may get a few “why didn’t you air my comment?”
questions from your listeners, but if they respect
your show, they should respect your decisions of
final show content.
Adding Feedback as a Show
Element
Collecting feedback is one thing, but figuring out
what to do with those e-mails, comments, and audio
files is another matter altogether. Sure, you can use
it to help improve your show, but also consider mak-
ing feedback a portion of your show’s content.
When you expose feedback to your listening audi-
ence, you can start a positive cycle that generates
more feedback — more content, which sparks more
feedback, and so on. If you can get past the Catch-22
of acquiring the feedback in the first place, judicious
use of it in your show will help get your audience
actively involved. It seems to appeal to our hive mind
that we should want to do as others are doing — and
leaving feedback for a podcast is no exception.
Responding to feedback during your show
Here are a few ways you can incorporate feedback
into your show:

The most common way to incorporate feed-
back is on the backside. This means reserving
the reading of e-mail or playing of audio com-
ments for the tail end of the show, after the
substance of the program has concluded. For
the standard “I love your show” comments, this
is a perfectly acceptable — and perhaps even
preferred — location. But understand that many
of your listeners won’t stick around to hear
these comments. 

If the feedback is more substantive, or is of a
nature that lends itself to further discussion on
your show, play the voicemail as an element
within the show. You can decide whether to play
the file clean or provide voiceover comments
while it’s playing. You decide. Practice 13 helps
you reduce any noise that may be a part of the
audio file; Practice 18 provides some ways to
make sure the audio level matches the rest of
your program.

Keeping Track of Conversations Off Your Site
277
Ultimately, you may find yourself with more
comments than you have content for your
show. While that may sound far-fetched, it is
not. One of your authors faced this very
dilemma and came up with an innovative
solution — create a separate-but-related
episode that features only feedback and the
responses from the hosts. Not only did this
allow substantially more feedback and com-
ments to be aired, but the listening audience
can skip the entire episode if they aren’t inter-
ested in the listener feedback.
Keeping Track of Conversations
Off Your Site
So far this practice has covered ways of encouraging
and dealing with the feedback your listeners provide
directly to you. But the decentralized nature of the
Internet and the advent of social online media are
giving your listeners the power to create their own
conversations on their own terms.
Some sites, like BoingBoing (http://boingboing.
net), embrace this idea fully — and have gone so far
as to completely remove the capability to comment
on their blogs. Instead, they encourage their readers
(and listeners to their infrequent podcasts) to
create their own blog posts — and then they use
the Trackback system to link the two together. It’s
beyond the scope of this book to cover the intrica-
cies of how trackbacks operate, but the functionality
is built in to most blogging applications and is
nearly automatic.
Responding to these off-site comments, be they on
personal Web sites, on social-networking sites, or
inside forums, can give you some immediately obvi-
ous benefits: Your response shows you care enough
to pay attention to what’s being said about your
show that you take the time to find it.
Luckily for you, the process of finding it is fairly sim-
ple. In Practice 2, we demonstrate how you can use
Google, Technorati, and other online tools to do
automated searches for the content you’re inter-
ested in. With some slight tweaks to those direc-
tions, you can set up a few “ego filters” to send you
an alert when new comments about you or your
podcast are introduced to the Web. 
At a minimum, set up a Google Alert and a
Technorati Watchlist (both covered extensively
in Practice 2) for your name, your podcast,
and the URL of your Web site.

Getting Featured on
Podcast Directories
T
here’s more to podcast directories than just being listed in the
rolls. After all, there’s a huge difference between being in the paper
and having the headline all to yourself. People have to put less
effort into discovering you if you’ve already been thrust to the top of the
heap, and more people will be interested in finding out about you
because you’ve gotten that notice. These front-page notices are almost
invariably good news, as well. Sites don’t waste the home page’s space
discussing terrible podcasts.
Making Your Numbers Count
Podcast directories don’t have access to the tracking numbers for your
podcast host, so they’re not going to know whether you have hundreds or
thousands of listeners unless you run those numbers through them. Most
directory services have links to assist listeners in subscribing to their
listed podcasts, even if it’s just a request for subscription information. 
So how do you boost your subscription numbers? You make it as easy as
possible for your listeners to know where and how they need to subscribe.
You also use every method of communication available to you.
Your podcast
Designate a part of your podcast to talk about the specific directory you
want to target and explain to your listeners what you’re trying to do.
Subscribing to a podcast doesn’t cost any money, so listeners who
haven’t subscribed (for instance, if they’ve been downloading specific
episodes from your site and not your feed) can be directed to the site of
your choice and boost your subscription numbers.
Your Web site and blog
There are quite a few ways to use your Web site or blog to get some
attention from podcasting directories. And it’s much easier than telling
your listeners what to do. In this case, you can set up links directly to the
directory and its subscription page, leading prospective listeners directly
35
Practice

Making Your Numbers Count
279
to where you need them to subscribe. Furthermore,
you can include links to multiple directories, so you
can take advantage of all the possible services with-
out wasting time in your podcast.
Some blog services also provide a pinging service,
which automatically sends a notice to podcast direc-
tories when new material is available on your feed.
Instead of allowing them to find out on their own
schedule, this gives them the heads-up immediately.
Directories really like podcasts that provide new
content on a regular basis — they’re not going to
waste their time promoting material that’s going to
go stale or fade out. Keep the episodes coming, and
let everybody know when they do.
Each Web service or software package has a different
way to set up a ping, but let’s take a look at the popu-
lar WordPress system. To set up a ping each time your
podcast and blog are updated, follow these steps:
1.
Log in to your WordPress site.
2.
Select the Options tab from the top WordPress
menu.
3.
Select the Writing tab from the menu that
comes up.
4. Enter the diectory’s ping server in the Update
Services field.
The ping server address will be available from the
directory itself.
For more information about integrating a blog into
your podcast service, take a look at Practice 26.
Social networks and bookmarks
Sites such as MySpace (www.myspace.com) and
Facebook (www.facebook.com) are more than just
places for teens to throw hundreds of self-portraits
on the Internet and leave comments for their friends
and favorite bands. These Web sites are established
portals for linking together people from all over the
globe — and everybody on those sites should be
considered a potential listener. You’re looking at two
main ways to show off your podcast on these sites:

Tell your friends — send out bulletins and mes-
sages to those on your friends list, and talk
about the podcast in your blog. Try to go
beyond crass self-promotion, though. People will
respond more to an actual message about the
podcast than they will just an update that says
“Hey, my new podcast is up!” Tell them about the
show, make it easy for them to subscribe, and
you’ll notice the difference in the numbers.

Get your friends to tell others — that’s what
makes social networks so important and vital.
Word of mouth is one of your most valuable mar-
keting tools. Once you get your friends talking
about your podcast, the word will spread
through their friends, through their friends’
friends, and so on. It sounds cheesy, but it
works. Make sure your friends know you want
them to subscribe — and that they have all of
the details to make it possible.
Beyond social networks are social bookmarking
sites, like StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com)
and Del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us), shown in
Figure 35-1. These sites take the bookmarks you
normally store on your browser and put them on a
common Internet server. From there, your friends
and acquaintances can see what you’re looking at
on the Web and take it from there. Not only that, but
they can share those bookmarks from there, starting
the same sort of chain reaction we looked at with
social networks.
• Figure 35-1: Del.icio.us.

comments and good ratings, ask your friends to
leave comments and good ratings, have your friends
tell their friends to leave comments and good rat-
ings, and so on. You can even leave a comment your-
self, but constantly inventing new “people” to give
your podcast five stars and stellar comments (talk
about cheesy) can backfire. It’s best to rely on real
and honest feedback. It’s okay to ask for it, but don’t
fake it.
• Figure 35-3: iTunes comments and ratings.
Building Bridges
There’s a reason they call those connections you
click on to find Web sites links — they create a net-
work of connections between sites, referring one
site to another in a never-ending string of paths to
new sites. Links are prized for their ability to drive
traffic from one site to another, increasing the popu-
larity of sites amongst both users and search
engines. The more links you have between sites, the
more traffic gets driven from one site to another.
If you’re driving a significant amount of traffic to a
podcast directory, the site will take notice. Therefore
it’s a good idea to feature a list of the directories you
use on your podcast’s Web site. Here are a few ways
you can do that:
In the case of StumbleUpon, shown in Figure 35-2,
you can even have others stumble on to your link
and check it out, if they are so inclined. It might be a
random discovery, but you should never underesti-
mate the power of a bored office worker surfing the
Web. The more people tag your site, the more times
your site will be referenced and passed on to other
users. It’s still word-of-mouth advertising. People are
just putting their bookmarks where their virtual
mouth is (so to speak).
• Figure 35-2: StumbleUpon.
For more information on using social networking to
advertise your blog, check out Practice 33.
Two Thumbs Up!
Podcast directories (and just about every other site
on the Internet, for that matter) have sections where
you can rate and comment on various podcasts. For
example, Figure 35-3 shows comments and ratings
for a podcast listed in the iTunes Music Store. You
want people to leave good ratings and comments in
order to help spread the word about your show, and
consequently get you more notice on the directory.
After all (and despite the better judgment of many),
folks still believe what they read on the Internet.
The strategy here is the same as the one you were
using with social media. Ask your listeners to leave

Building Bridges
281

Make a separate section for the listings on your
site. A static collection of links that point to these
directories, placed on your site’s home page, is
an excellent way to point traffic in their direction.

Text links are fine, but graphics or banners can
attract more attention. If the directories provide
these goodies, consider using banner ads (as in
Figure 35-4) with links to drive traffic to their
sites.
• Figure 35-4: Podcast Pickle banner ads.

Make sure the directories know you’ve added
the link. They’ll notice increased traffic prima-
rily, but a quick e-mail or comment wouldn’t
hurt, to let them know where it’s coming from!
The podcast directories have already set up their
reciprocal link to you — that happens when they
host your profile in their directory. This is just a
good way to spread the word that your podcast is
part of their directory, and that people can sub-
scribe at their site. You’re happy, they’re happy,
everybody’s happy. It’s like a virtual campfire, minus
the singing and burnt marshmallows.

Joining a Podcast
Network
A
podcast network goes far beyond what a podcast directory (dis-
cussed in Practice 28) can do for you. A podcast directory makes
sure you’re listed and available. You still have to do all the leg-
work of putting together your show, making sure it gets onto your server,
and selling any advertising you may want to include. Think of the pod-
cast network as the equivalent of a record label offering a contract for
your CD — or having NBC pick up your pilot — they take some of the
work off of your plate and make it easier to concentrate on your show.
They may even put some money in your pocket through the use of adver-
tising or sponsorships. It may not be a multimillion-dollar deal signed
in the Capitol building, but it could be a big boost to your show.
Finding the Right Network for Your Podcast
Because so many podcasts are available these days, having a network to
help distribute your show can really help get you some recognition. It
also means the networks have a lot of competition for spots; you have to
stand out from the others. The first thing to do is find the network that
could benefit both you and your show. While your podcast on financial
affairs could fit on a more general-interest network, you might find a
money-specific outlet that could bring you more listeners — and maybe
more money as well.
Begin your search where most things on the Internet begin — the search
engine. Just entering podcast network on Google pulls up millions of refer-
ences; some might be a little vague (although it does pull up some very
popular entries and podcast networks). Just a few more keywords and
you can narrow those choices down to some more-manageable choices.
From there, most of the work is looking at specific sites and seeing what
podcasts they host (you may even recognize some of the names) and
assessing whether you think your show might fit in. Some examples
include these (of which Figure 36-1 is a sample):

It’s also a good idea to refer to Practice 32 and talk
to other podcasters and bloggers about what they
think of these networks — and get their opinions on
which ones might be a good choice for you. Talk to
those involved with specific networks; find out what
they think about being involved with those organiza-
tions. You should also check out messageboards
and forums to see what (if anything) is being said
about the networks you’re interested in. And be sure
to give every comment the same treatment you
should give all information on the Internet — it may
be interesting, but remember the source and use
that in evaluating your response to it. Good news
can be self-serving babbling, bad news can be spite,
and no news could mean the network isn’t doing its
job in getting the word out.
What Your Network 
Can Do for You
Different networks provide different levels of serv-
ices, depending on their podcast-circulation and rev-
enue numbers. Some provide hosting services,
production assistance, and advertising sales. They
also group your show together with others that
could share audiences. That way you get exposure to
audiences who should be interested in your subject
matter but might not have wandered across it before.
This kind of help can be huge in exposing your show
to thousands more potential listeners or viewers.
Those services might well be necessary if your pod-
cast does get a larger audience. You’ll need the
added bandwidth and advertising support if there’s
more demand for your show.
What You Can (And Must)
Do for Your Network
Most networks require you to bring an already siz-
able (for podcasting, anyway) audience with you.
Some may require 500 listeners, some may require
more. You can be sure, though, that most require far
more subscribers than just your friends and family.
You have to have an audience for your show already,

goes above and beyond the podcast recording (such
as sharing ad revenue, producing advertisements for
use on other podcasts, and promoting your podcast
in other forums like blogs, interviews, or real-world
events).
Making the Decision
You might want to take out the notepad and start
your pro/con list right now. You have to balance
what you want to do with your podcast versus what
responsibilities you’ll have to the network. You
probably already have a decent audience if you’re
considering this move. Here are some points to pon-
der when making your decision:

Do you want more listeners, or are you okay
with what you have? 

Are you looking to make some money off your
efforts, or is this just something you do for fun? 

Are you open to working with others to produce
your show, or is it something personal that you
want to keep under your own control?
After you evaluate all the factors and made your
decision, have fun with it! No matter what happens,
you’ve considered all the factors that affect the
immediate future of your podcast — and you’re
doing what you want with your show. It’s important
not to lose sight of what drove you to make this
show in the first place. That will be with you
whether you’re sticking with your original plan or
making the leap to a bigger pond.
and you have to be able to show that this audience
exists — specifically, through tracking numbers.
Each Internet service provider has different tools for
tracking downloads from your site, but you’re going
to have to get the numbers.
Yep, we’re way beyond the level of podcasting as a
hobby here, and well into the realm of business. No
surprise that the networks expect you to go along
with their business plans. The podcast networks
have likely put together a business plan (with the
help of lawyers and other expensive business
types), and you’re going to have to get with their
program if you want to be part of it. Bottom line:
When you enter into a podcasting network agree-
ment, that network is going to have a say in how
your show gets publicized and distributed.
Before you sign anything, make sure you’re
comfortable with what the network is trying to
accomplish — and get your own legal expert
to review the agreement before you sign any-
thing. Podcasting can be a fiercely independ-
ent medium, and you might not want anybody
telling you how you can talk about (say) the
intricate plot maneuverings of the various
Star Trek series.
Finally, you have to be consistent. Early on, your
podcast may have been a labor of love, something
you put together just because you wanted to. Others
picked up on that passion, and you have a sizable
listenership. Now that you’re on a network, though,
there are other considerations. In exchange for its
services, the network is going to want a regular net-
work show — likely with involvement from you that

hile podcasting is gaining momentum and notoriety with every
episode that finds a place in the iTunes directory, getting the
word out that you have a podcast worthy of attention remains
reliant on the traditional media. Print. Radio. Television. The big three.
Contacting the media isn’t difficult; the challenge lies in getting the media
to contact you. Podcasting is still new to the world and a growing move-
ment in media, marketing, and promotion — and now the big three are
beginning to take notice.
There is a science in reaching the media. You need a certain amount of
patience and thick skin as you go about trying to convince the media
that this isn’t a run-of-the-mill podcast you’re recording in your basement
(even if that’s where you did it), but a podcast that they need to listen to.
Getting the media’s attention is not an easy task, but it’s not impossible
either. 
Writing Press Releases
Press releases are the tried-and-true devices used for connecting with the
media. The typical press release can be easily broken up into several sec-
tions: who, what, where, and when. Sounds like a promo (as described
in Practice 29)? No surprise there. Much like the minute-long audio com-
mercial, a press release needs to be a short, efficient statement about
your podcast.
Title
The title of your press release can sometimes be the hardest thing to
write because it has to capture the entire newsworthiness of your article
in just one line of attention-grabbing text!

give the media a jumping point for questions they
may ask in a future interview. Here’s an example:
“If MOREVI is described as Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon meets Pirates of the Caribbean,
then Billibub Baddings is The Lord of the Rings
written by Mickey Spillane. Instead of the
pirates, swordfights, and swashbuckling
adventure of my first podcast, I’m offering an
axe-wielding dwarf standing toe-to-toe with
the mob in 1929 Chicago.” No one in either the
hard-boiled detective or high-fantasy genre is
safe in Billibub Baddings, and in this produc-
tion Morris is bringing a few friends along
for the ride. “Billibub Baddings will showcase
an international cast, contributing their voices
to my novel.” 
His cast includes podcasters Leann Mabry of
Tag in the Seam, Paul S. Jenkins of the U.K.
podcast Rev Up Review, and Chuck Tomasi of
Technorama. Morris’ voice talents also include
award-nominated authors Scott Sigler
(EarthCore, Ancestor), J.C. Hutchins (7th Son),
and New Zealand author Pip Ballantine
(Chasing the Bard); award-winning author Paul
Levinson (The Silk Code) and New York Times
Bestseller Tracy Hickman (The Dragonlance
novels). “Podcasting MOREVI was a lot of hard
work, but it was also a lot of fun. Bringing
friends into this production has just stepped
everything up a level, and I could not be hap-
pier with the end results.”
The closing paragraph
End your press release with the where of your pod-
cast. Where will they find it? Where will people be
able to listen to it? By now the who, what, and why
have all been covered. By concluding your press
release with the where, which should also include
where you can be contacted for an interview, you
leave the media with all the essential information
needed for a follow-up call.
When writing the title, ask yourself what this press
release is all about. The answer, boiled down to one
sentence, will be your title:
New Podcast Novel from
Award-Nominated Author Officially Launched
Introductory paragraph
The introductory paragraph provides a lead-in to
the story you are presenting to the media. It can
begin with the who and provide some background
about the podcast host or the inspiration behind the
podcast. By the end of the introductory paragraph,
you should reach the intent of the press release.
Here’s an example:
Tee Morris challenged both publishing and
audiobook conventions in January 2005 by
giving away his fantasy novel, MOREVI: The
Chronicles of Rafe and Askana, as a podcast.
Done as a serial, each chapter of the novel
was made available to mp3 players every-
where. The co-author of Podcasting For
Dummies officially returns to the podcast fic-
tion arena with Billibub Baddings and the Case
of the Singing Sword, now playing at
TeeMorris.com and Podiobooks.com.
The body paragraph
The body is the portion of the press release where
you cover the basic facts about what your podcast
is all about. You can include more detailed behind-
the-podcast background, as well as any feedback
you may receive — in advance or after the initial
episodes are released.
Another option with the body of a press release is to
include quotes from either cast members or yourself
concerning the podcast. It may seem a little odd

or www.dragonmoonpress.com.
Making Cold Calls
Cold calls are an early-morning or late-afternoon
process: running down a list of press contacts you
have collected, giving each one a call, and repeating
the same salutation and message to the press con-
tact on the other end of the phone, one by one.
This type of contact is by far the most aggressive,
the most self-testing, and the most demoralizing of
approaches you can take when calling media con-
tacts. A thick skin and a strong stomach are basic
equipment when you take on the task of cold-calling
media contacts.
Why are cold calls so difficult? Well (for openers), the
sheer number of people doing them. Media contacts,
from the local newspaper with a staff of five all the
way up to the staff of NBC Nightly News in New York,
receive hundreds of calls — all concerning an event
or an individual — that must be covered for their
publication or news show. Morning wake-up radio
shows, afternoon variety newsmagazines, and the
late-evening news are bombarded with leads. So if the
contacts seem curt with you on the follow-up call,
consider that they are on deadlines, are still polishing
up stories from previous days, and are following up
from yesterday’s cold calls — all at the same time.
When you’re engaging in the martial art of cold-call-
ing, be sure you’ve done some prep work before-
hand — and then be ready to pitch your podcast
when you dial the phone.
Do your homework
Do a little homework to find out whom you’ll be con-
tacting. Calling a newspaper or a radio station is
merely the first step. For the typical media affiliate,
the first person to answer a call is usually a recep-
tionist or switchboard operator who asks you where
to direct your call. 
To find out where you’re headed (before you even
get to that encounter), surf over to your media af-
filiate’s online resource. You can find Web sites and
direct e-mail contacts at the end of articles, at the
bottom of the front page, or inside the first page of a
standard newspaper — and in directories of staff
contacts on Web sites for radio stations and tele-
vision affiliates. Departments that you have the 
best chance of scoring a hit with include these:

Local News 

Style

Tech
Script out and rehearse what 
you are going to say
This mantra can also be applied to approaching peo-
ple with an on-the-street interview, but you should
know — before dialing the phone — exactly what
you’re going to say. The only thing cold about the call
should be the fact that it is coming unannounced and
unexpectedly. Speak up, be clear, and be confident.
That will really ring true and help sell you as a poten-
tial feature.

Practice 37: Connecting with the Media
288
Remember whose time you are taking up
You may hear this bit of advice again and again. Yes,
your time is very valuable; but time’s value is rela-
tive to the current deadline you face. At media affili-
ates, every day is a deadline. Remain polite, remain
professional, and never get snippy or curt with the
media contacts you make. That will be a hard bridge
to rebuild after you burn it.
Don’t take rejection personally
If you get turned down for an interview, remember
Tee’s two-word mantra: “Their loss.” An interview —
a really, really good interview — can make the
rounds on the Internet, getting you a good amount
of press outside your region and earning the
reporter you talk with a memorable byline.
If you’re turned down for an interview after a cold
call, take a breath and say out loud, “Their loss.”
Okay, you’re done. Move on to the next contact.
When you’re doing your prep work on what
department or section of a media affiliate would
be a good fit for your podcast, consider the
topic of your podcast. If you do a sound-seeing
tour of Ireland or a show on how to pack for
vacations across the country or overseas, then
Travel would be a good contact to make. If you
are hosting a podcast on NASCAR or your
favorite NFL or NHL franchise, give the Sports
section a call. Along with the broad appeal of
podcasting as a medium, look at the topic of
your podcast and find a good niche for it.
Creating an Effective Press Kit
Another great way of grabbing the media’s attention
is to provide them with background research on you
and your podcast. You don’t want to send them a
truckload of material that will overwhelm them, but
just enough information to get the questions rolling.
To accomplish this, you need a press kit to put
online, send in via mail, or drop off in person. 
A good script to follow for talking to media contacts
looks like this: 
“Good (morning/ afternoon/evening). My
name is (your name), and I am calling to talk
to you about an upcoming podcast concern-
ing (quick one-sentence sum up of your
podcast). Do you have a few minutes?” 
This will get you one of three things: a follow-up
date in the future when you can talk, a polite “No,
thank you,” or an abrupt dial tone. But read on.
Don’t get discouraged
If you get the dial tone as a reply, forge ahead. Don’t
allow this action to demoralize you; there is nothing
personal in the hang-up. These folks get a lot of calls
like this, and if you can’t grab them in the first
minute, they have another lead to pursue, another
fact to double-check, or another deadline to attend
to. There are people who cold-call media contacts
for a living, and they deal with this sort of thing
all the time; so if you get dial tone as a response,
remember: It’s not you. Just cross off that contact
and start again with the next contact on your list.
Be ready to talk
What’s the worst thing that could happen when you
do a cold call to the media? The hang-up? No. The
opposite — a “yes” that catches you flat-footed:
“Oh, you want to talk to me now?! Um, okay (papers
shuffle), just, ah, let me take care of some things
over here. . . .” If the cold call is a hit, then you need
to be ready to talk immediately. Have any notes you
want to get across about your podcast, about your
approach to the project, and about your future plans
for the podcast, at the ready.
You should prep for the best reaction possible,
and the best reaction you can have to a cold
call is an interview. The possibilities are slim
that this might happen, but it’s best to be
ready in case it does. 

Creating an Effective Press Kit
289
A press kit also travels under other monikers —
press package, media kit, and press materials — but
whatever the name, it’s a collection of descriptive
and promotional materials, usually organized in a
snappy portfolio to accompany a press release.
Consider the press kit a jumbo-size combo press
release with curly fries and the Hoover Dam–size
soda. The DVD that comes with this book includes
three excellent real-life press kits that you should be
sure to check out.
The essentials
Putting together a press kit is only one more varia-
tion on the same themes involved with writing a
press release. You need to include the “who, what,
and when,” but along with that, you can include
“look, listen, and enjoy” options.
Here are the essentials of a podcast’s press kit:

Cover letter introducing yourself, your podcast,
and your desire for an interview

Current press release

Cast photos or press photos of podcast’s
host/hosts either in studio or recording 

Cast biographies

Contact information

CD (preferably with uncompressed files on it,
otherwise include with the CD instructions on
how to play the mp3s) of the first five (or five
favorite) episodes
You may think a CD doesn’t need a set of
instructions; but not all CDs are the same: On
seeing a CD, recipients make two assumptions:
(1) “It’s an audio CD that will play in my com-
puter’s CD/DVD drive or music player, or on
my car CD,” or (2) “It’s a data CD and should
be treated as such.” Audio CDs, depending on
the length of your show, may hold only an
episode or two. They can play on more than
just computer CD drives, but you won’t be
able to feature as much of your podcast as
you might like. mp3 CDs easily hold five
episodes, but they can make some press con-
tacts scratch their heads if the CD doesn’t play
in their car player. If you decide to include a
CD for this press kit, make sure you include a
set of instructions for playback.
Extras you may want to include
With the essentials taken care of, a podcaster’s
press kit may appear a little thin at first, but you can
add a few more items to grab the media’s attention.
Here are some additional options to consider for
your press kit:

Printed articles or copies of other news and
media articles (no more than three)

A list of accomplishments and accolades for the
podcast (featuring pull quotes from celebrities,
subject authorities, and other podcasters)

A business card with your immediate contact
information

Additional CD or (data) DVD of previous live
appearances or interviews (and with data DVDs,
it’s even more important to include an instruc-
tion sheet that explains how to read and retrieve
the data)
Never send originals. The information you
include in a press kit is considered disposable.
Rarely will you get a press kit back, even if you
express in a cover letter that you wish to have
the press kit returned to you. If you include a
self-addressed stamped envelope big enough
to hold the press kit, it may be returned to you
without fail, but the condition of the press kit
may be a different matter. When you’re send-
ing press kits, always send high-quality copies
of originals and expect that you will not
receive the materials back. If you need to get a
press kit in the mail quickly, remember, there
is always a FedEx/Kinko’s open somewhere
where you can make sharp photocopies and
build up a press kit in no time.

Practice 37: Connecting with the Media
290
But watch out for assumptions: If you’re doing a
same-day follow up with media affiliates and you
expect them to have reviewed your materials
already, the same-day follow-up comes across as a
little pushy. It is also a bad idea to assume the media
has considered your press release and decided
whether or not to interview you. Remember that the
media contacts are working on yesterday’s leads
and today’s deadlines, so your press kit may not
have been reviewed yet. A same-day follow-up won’t
kill your chances for an interview unless you’re
expecting an interview or a decision concerning
your press release at that moment. Such an overly
aggressive approach can sour a reporter’s opinion
of how newsworthy your story is. 
When doing a same-day follow-up, keep it simple:
“Hello, my name is (your name) and I’m just
calling to confirm that you received my press
(release/kit).” 
On the acknowledgment that the package arrived,
thank the contacts for their time. If they have not
received the press release or package, simply state,
“That’s fine. I left the press kit at the front desk, so it
should be there. Thanks for your time . . .” or “Do
you have an e-mail address that I can send the press
release to?” Remember, you’re not looking for an
immediate interview, just confirmation that the con-
tents of the kit have arrived.
Same-week follow-up: A happy medium
When sending press kits, the U.S. Postal Service’s
Delivery Confirmation is a terrific investment. You
can track your package from mailing date to arrival
date. After you get the confirmation, give your press
release or kit two to three days to be looked at.
Then make the follow-up call to the recipient.
It starts much like the same-day confirmation call: 
“Hello, my name is (your name) and I’m just
calling to confirm that you received my press
(release/kit).” 
As with promos, less is more with both press
releases and press kits. You don’t want to over-
whelm media contacts with clippings, CDs, DVDs,
and photographs. You want to keep your facts clear,
your information organized, and your resources
easy to process. 
The Follow-Up
As busy as media outlets get, it’s all too easy to fall
between the cracks or to have the press kit arrive,
only to be buried under a mountain of other press
releases and press kits. All that traffic is a definite
pitfall in your pursuit of press coverage.
This is why it is not a bad idea, after the press
release or the press kit is delivered, to do a follow-
up call. And that’s all about timing.
Timing is also key when you write your press
release. Writing a press release the night
before a podcast’s launch, for example, is not
the best strategy; you don’t have any time to
build anticipation or hype. If you know when
your podcast will be launching, write your
press release two to three weeks before the
launch. That way you have time for the press
release or kit to circulate, and for following up
as recommended here. If your press release is
announcing the conclusion of the podcast’s
season, release it a few weeks before the
finale. You want to make certain that the press
release’s content, timing, and circulation all
work well together.
The same-day follow-up: Proceed with caution
If the fax machine you’re using is on the blink, or if
you just came home from hand-delivering a press kit
to local media affiliates, the same-day follow-up is
not out of the ordinary. When you make the follow-
up call, you’re simply practicing good form and look-
ing for confirmation that the package was received.

The Follow-Up
291
Wait for a reply. If the media contact has the kit
or release, you can ask, “Have you found a moment
to review it yet?” That is a genuine, honest question,
and it may yield you an equally genuine, honest
answer. It may not be the answer you want to hear;
but regardless, you will want to say, “Thank you 
so much for your consideration . . . ,” ending on a
favorable and professional tone. 
You’re competing against other leads, other
features, other news bites — and there will be
times when you will grab someone’s attention
and times when other items (such as how a
home featured in a Woody Allen film sold for
a cool sum) take priority over your audio cre-
ation. (No lie, it happened to Tee!) Hope for
the best; but if the worst befalls on you, handle
it like a pro.
The week-after follow-up: You are who again?
In all things concerning news, timeliness is every-
thing. What is the hottest story early Monday morn-
ing is old news a week later. And even for features
that don’t date themselves by their content, news-
worthy information has a shelf life. And with the
kudzu-like growth of information distribution via
RSS feeds, that shelf life is fleeting.
Waiting a week to follow up after sending in a press
release is far too long. In that time, many more press
releases have stacked up on the desk of your poten-
tial contact, and you can bet that interns are cur-
rently sorting through faxes arriving during the
weekend that will add to this poor reporter’s pile.
All this is happening before the reporter checks his
or her e-mail. A lot of news can happen in a week’s
time, so it is something to consider when waiting a
week to follow up on your press releases. 
Of course, waiting a week to follow up a press kit
may actually work in your favor. The press kit’s con-
tents are more robust than a press release’s, so you
may want to allot plenty of time for the contact to
review the contents. (Just remember that it’s no
guarantee that the press kit has been reviewed.)
When you reach the contact, introduce yourself
again with, “Hello, my name is (your name) . . ., “ but
this time ask, “I’m just calling to see if you have
reviewed my press kit concerning (your podcast)?”
Wait for the reply. 
The media contact could still be considering it or
may answer with “Yes, and I don’t think there’s any
news there.” The other possibility is that the con-
tact will want to talk to you and arrange a formal
interview or conduct one there and then. (Again, be
prepared for the best as well as the worst.)
No matter the outcome, you’ll want to maintain a
positive, professional demeanor: “Thank you for
your consideration.” That’s always a nice way to end
a conversation with the media.
The frequency of the follow-ups
In the age of voice mailboxes, trying to talk to a
flesh-and-blood voice can be as challenging as find-
ing the courage to make the follow-up call. Here are
some suggestions for the timing of your follow-ups:

First follow-up: Two to three days after sending
the press release or kit

Second follow-up: Four days after first follow-up

Third follow-up: Four days after second follow-up
Is there a magic formula here? No, not really, but
each call here is less than a week after the previous
one, so not too much time elapses between calls.
Usually by the second follow-up, the press contact
will attempt to reach you. If no response comes after
the third follow-up, it’s best to cross off that contact
and move on to the next press contact or follow-up.
The process of establishing media contacts makes
editing and post-production of the podcast itself a
joy. This contact process isn’t easy, not by a long
shot. But with some perseverance, the end result —
media coverage — can be an addition to your (now
growing) press package and perhaps even win you
some new listeners in the process.

I
f you do a search on Amazon.com or hit your local bookstore of
choice, you find a lot of books about interviewing. It might surprise
you how many people have written books on how to sit down with
someone and carry on a conversation with them because, after all, that’s
all an interview is, right? 
Actually, an interview is a lot more than just asking the other person on
the opposite end of the table, “So tell me, what do you do for a living?”
Body language, appropriate questions, and delivery of said appropriate
questions are just a few things that are important and essential in making
an interview a pleasant and positive experience for both the podcast
host and the guest. An interview goes well beyond the questions asked;
it’s all about the experience shared. In this practice, you find out what is
waiting for you under the thin candy shell surrounding a really good
interview.
The Interview Query
You have two ways of asking people for an interview, and both require an
outgoing personality to pull them off, and pull them off seamlessly. The
“asking part” is perhaps one of the toughest hurdles for people to clear
when asking for an interview. Yes, you may hear people like the
GeekLabel Crew, Victor Caijao, and Leann Mabry say, “Just go up to them
and ask . . ., “ but on meeting the GeekLabel guys, Victor, and Leann, you
know they have the personalities to pull off this approach. 
On the street: Guerrilla journalism

subjects — be they celebrities, authorities, or just
people-on-the-street — are completely caught off
guard and unprepared. If you’re fortunate, the peo-
ple you stop can think fast on their feet and provide
lengthy answers that can be included in your
episode with no editing or chopped up to provide
quick sound bites for segments of the topic you’re
discussing. This aggressive approach to journalism,
where the interviewer comes at the interview sub-
ject on the spot, usually flying by the seat of his or
her pants, is guerrilla journalism.
This style of interview may seem totally sponta-
neous, but there is an art to it. Here are some tips to
keep in mind when doing your own “on the street”
interviews:

Be clear and concise when asking the inter-
view subject to stop and talk. True, in a
crowded setting of paparazzi, people are scream-
ing for the attention of celebrities, but most on-
the-street settings don’t require such an
aggressive tactic. You want to keep it quick:
“Hey, would you like to be interviewed today
about (subject matter)?” may be all you need.
Where it gets tricky is when you have to say it
over and over again until finally someone stops
and says, “Sure, I’ll talk to you.” 
Attempt to make eye contact with passers-by
and remember to speak up, be clear, and be
confident. 

Have a release on hand for people to sign. It’s a
good idea to have a legal release on hand for
your interview subjects to sign before the inter-
view begins. A release is a permission slip that
grants you the right to use the interview sub-
ject’s voice and likeness in your podcast. This
means you owe the subject no money or com-
pensation (although notification of the podcast’s
posting is extremely polite) for the interview, and
the subject is granting you permission to use his
or her voice and likeness in advertising and pro-
motion. (For more on legal releases, see the later
section “Legal Releases: Podcasting Paperwork.”)
For downloadable examples of legal releases,
take a look at Current TV (www.current.
tv/make/resources), which offers PDFs of
basic releases.

Keep it to four questions or ten minutes,
whichever comes first. These are fast and furi-
ous interviews you’re conducting, and while it is
a nice idea and good practice to have more ques-
tions ready than you need, consider the setting
and the subjects. You don’t know if the interview
subject will deliver, or if the interview will be
gold, but limit the time. Have four questions at
the ready. If you manage to hit ten minutes
before you’ve asked all your prepared questions,
then end the interview, thank the subject, and
move on to the next interview. 

Try to hold interviews with a backup, that is,
somebody to cover your back. Whether you
have a friend standing a few sidewalk tiles away,
watching from the diner in front of you, or physi-
cally present, remember you’re dealing with the
general public — complete strangers. Personal
safety should always come first. 

Remember whose time you’re taking. The inter-
view is happening in real time with no prepara-
tion on either side. If your interview subjects
need to leave, thank them for their time and let
them leave. The gesture of thanks ends the inter-
view on a positive note.
Scheduled interviews: “Do you 
have 30 minutes?”
You can schedule some interviews ahead of time,
on location. This type of interview falls between
the on-the-street interview and the formal query
(described next). Here, you happen to run across
the interview subject and simply ask, “Hey, we are
recording between the hours of 1:00 and 3:00. Come
on by!” In this situation, the subject may have time
to mentally prepare for the interview. The intervie-
wee may need to leave after a pre-scheduled amount
of time, but whatever time the subject can give you


Be gracious about the interview. If your subject
or your subject’s handler wishes to review the
questions being asked, it is a good idea to let
him or her know upfront that you may not get to
all these questions. (As fun as it is to watch an
interview subject’s eyes bug out when he or she
sees all the questions you wish to ask, it’s better
to have a relaxed subject.) Go one step further
and ask, “If you have any specific questions
you’d like to address, please let me know.” While
this is a scheduled interview time, the subject
may wish to talk about something specific based
on one of your questions or something you did
not have noted as a topic of discussion.

When time is up, time is up. No matter how well
the interview is going, keep an eye on the time,
particularly if the subject needs to leave your
interview to go to another event or, most likely,
another interview. If your interview subject
needs to leave, thank that person for his or her
time. As with the on-the-street interview, end the
interview on a positive note.
The six-million-dollar interview
Paul Fischer and Martha Holloway, hosts of The Balticon
Podcast, scheduled an interview with science fiction lumi-
nary Harve Bennett. Bennett, while not known for his time
on camera, is one of the major players of science fiction tel-
evision, having produced The Six Million Dollar Man, The
Bionic Woman, and the blockbuster films Star Trek II, III, IV,
and V. (Chances are good that if you’ve watched science
fiction on TV, you’ve probably seen something that Harve
Bennett has produced.) Paul sat down and wrote five ques-
tions for a 30-minute interview.
Paul asked his first question, and it was the only one he
needed: “How did you find yourself involved in producing
the Star Trek film series?” Bennett’s answer, never rambling
but a passionate and engaging perspective on his own
journey — beginning with The Wrath of Khan and conclud-
ing with The Final Frontier — clocked in at just under 25
minutes.
At the end of the answer, Paul smiled and said, “Thank you
very much, Mr. Bennett.” Truly, everything Paul could have
asked for in an interview happened with one question.
is quality time; don’t waste it with introduction ban-
ter. Simply ask, “Are you all set?” and then begin the
interview.
A variation on this theme is at a formal event (con-
vention, expo, and so on) featuring authorities and
celebrities in certain fields, where media organizers
formally arrange time slots for interviews. In certain
situations, the handlers (personal assistants that
sometimes double as bodyguards, PR agents, and so
on) of the interview subjects may want to see the
questions you wish to ask beforehand. Other times,
you may simply go up to the individual — or the
individual comes to you — and the clock starts run-
ning when the subject takes his or her seat. 
Regardless of the setting for this kind of interview,
the practice and approach are the same:

Prepare more questions than needed. It’s your
30 minutes (or more or less) with this guest. You
want to make it count. Therefore, prepare as
many questions as you like. A good formula for
interview questions is to figure two-minute
answers for every question, and then five-minute
answers for every question. For example, if you
have five questions for a fair interview subject
(two-minute answers), your interview covers ten
minutes. If the subject gives you an exceptional
interview (five-minute answers), you have
almost 30 minutes of material to pull from. With
this in mind, come up with twice as many ques-
tions as you think you need. 

Have a release on hand for people to sign. As
mentioned earlier, the release form is good to
have on hand so you and the subject are clear as
to what the recorded material will be used for.
The handler and subject may wish to review the
release before starting. (In this case, it’s best to
have them look at the release beforehand so it
doesn’t cut into the interview time. If it does,
adjust. Don’t pressure anyone to sign anything.
Ever.) Be sure to have a pen on hand, too.

Formal interview queries: 
Marking your calendar
Some interviews come with plenty of notice and
allow ample time for preparation. These interviews
usually begin with a formal query, either through
media channels or directly (via e-mail, voicemail, a
phone call, or face-to-face), where introductions are
made and goals for the interview are set.
Here’s a suggested format for a formal interview
query via e-mail:
“Hi, my name is (your name here) of (your pod-
cast title), a podcast that takes a look at (what
your podcast is all about). I would love to talk
to you for my podcast about (the reason why
you want to have this person on your show as a
guest). At your earliest convenience, please
contact me at this e-mail address or at (best
phone number) with your availability for an
interview. Thank you for your time.”
If you’re conducting a formal interview query via
phone, try this format:
“Hi, my name is (your name here), and I am
host of (your podcast title), a podcast that
talks about (what your podcast is all about). I
would love to schedule an interview with you
at your earliest convenience concerning (the
reason why you want to have this person as a
guest on your show). Please contact me at
either (mobile number) or (home number or
work number) if you would care to schedule
an interview. Thank you for your time.”
That’s all there is to it! While both queries differ
slightly in approach and delivery, the following sug-
gestions work well for contacting potential subjects
for both types of interviews:

Open with a friendly greeting telling the poten-
tial contact who you are and with whom you’re
affiliated with.

Give a one-sentence summary of what your pod-
cast is all about. (The query is not a pitch for
your show or for podcasting, so keep your show
summary to one sentence.)

Explain why the interview subject is being
invited to appear on the show.

Provide the contact information for the subject
to reach you.
You may be asked to share the questions you
want to ask in the interview. Just as discussed
in the scheduled interviews, be upfront about
the questions you want to ask. In some situa-
tions, you may have an extended discussion
with a handler or some sort of media contact,
and it is good practice to be as forthcoming
with your intent and direction for the interview.
Legal Releases: Podcasting
Paperwork 
As defined earlier, a release is a permission slip from
the interview subject allowing you to use his or her
voice and likeness in your podcast. Releases are
usually worded this way:
I consent to the use by (your podcast or your
studio name), or their agents or assignees, of
my name and/or portrait, picture, photo-
graph, video recording, audio recording, or
any other visual or audio likeness of me for
use worldwide in the podcast, (your podcast),
and its promotion. This consent applies to
use in any medium now known or to be devel-
oped in the future. 

Practice 38: Talk to Me: Interviews
296
Establishing contacts
The best way to go about securing an interview is to
ask questions. If you want to interview a museum
curator, call the museum’s administrative offices
and ask for the media contact. If the museum or
other organization doesn’t have a media relations
department, then ask, “With whom can I arrange an
interview with (name of the desired interview
subject)?” The person on the phone may reply curtly
before hanging up on you, or politely ask you to sub-
mit questions and even a one-page proposal explain-
ing why you want to conduct this interview and how
this interview will go. Your results may vary.
The contacts you make when searching for inter-
views may produce for you right away or provide
subjects for you to interview later on. This is why
you need to keep a professional attitude and a pleas-
ant disposition when making the initial queries.
Attending special events and conventions
Do a quick search on the Web or in your local or
regional paper to find out about upcoming special
events in your area. Many of the following events
feature guest speakers with whom you may want to
seek interviews:

Conventions

Expos and trade shows

Book signings and speaking events
It’s a good idea to bring your portable recorder with
you to these events, just in case you have the oppor-
tunity to schedule an interview on the spot with the
featured special guest of one of these events.
However, the main reason for attending these events
is to establish contacts for future interviews. Have
on hand a business card, preferably with your name,
your show’s name, and your contact information so
interview subjects can either follow up with you per-
sonally or pass along your contact information to
their media staffs.
I expressly release (your podcast or your studio
name), and their agents or assignees from any
privacy, defamation, or other claims I may
otherwise have arising out of podcast, broad-
cast, exhibition, cablecast, Webcast, publica-
tion, promotion, or other use of my portrait,
picture, photograph, audio recording, or any
other visual or audio likeness of me. 
This release sounds very formal, almost too formal,
for podcasting, doesn’t it? Well, it is, and podcasters
(at present) do not fall under all the restrictions
the FCC and other communication organizations
impose on radio, television, and film. However, with
the RIAA stepping in and restricting playback of
copyrighted material (discussed in Practice 20), this
may change.
Some forward-thinking podcasters have adopted a
legal release for their podcasts, just to get into this
practice in case things change. Even if the FCC and
lawmakers decide that podcasting is best self-
policed rather than government regulated, having
your interview subjects sign a legal release puts you
in a good position should any future regulations
befall podcasting.
Finding Good Interview
Subjects
Depending on the subject matter of your podcast,
landing interviews can be difficult. For example, say
you have a sports podcast and you want to inter-
view Sammy Sosa about the art of hitting home
runs. Unless you work for ESPN, it’s not like you can
call Sammy’s staff or even the Texas Rangers’ office
and schedule an interview. You may be able to make
it happen with a few repeat follow-ups, patience, and
some (but not too much) persistence; but finding
good interviews may not be as hard as this.

Interviewing Unconventional Experts
297
When querying celebrities and authorities for an
interview at these events, consider the timing of
the query. If the subject invites audience members
for questions at the end of a lecture, that is not the
right time to ask for an interview. However, if the
subject is signing autographs, stand in line and wait
your turn. Then step up, present your business
card, and simply ask, “I was wondering if you are
granting interviews this afternoon and how I could
schedule an interview. If today is not an option, are
you available sometime later in the month?” This
way, you can make contact with the subject but not
take up too much of his or her time or hold up the
line of autograph seekers.
At many of these events, a media relations
representative is present. Contact that person
first to inquire about the availability of a
celebrity or authority you want to interview.
The subject may be in the company of a han-
dler who has the final say on if and when the
interview will happen. 
Making direct contact via the Internet
Sometimes, an interview can happen simply by
sending someone an e-mail. Look for Web sites,
online forums, and blogs that focus on the chosen
topic of your podcast. Here, you can follow leads,
click e-mail addresses, and find yourself arranging
interviews with award-winning authors, local politi-
cians and newsmakers, medical professionals, and a
wide array of authorities who are more than willing
to sit down with you for an interview. 
Again, the same rules apply — have a legal release
ready, offer the questions up front, and make sure
you’re respectful of the interview subject’s time.
This time, however, the connection can be arranged
over time and taken at a much slower pace than the
on-the-street or scheduled interview. You can take
time to prep questions, test audio recording equip-
ment, and make sure you’re ready.
When you’re ready for the interview, it’s in your best
interest and in your interview subject’s interest to
run down a final checklist:

Test your recording equipment over Skype, the
telephone, or whatever device you’re using to
record the interview. Make sure the audio equip-
ment is working properly before the interview;
don’t wait until the interview for testing.

Prepare for the interview as thoroughly as you
can. Find out a few facts about your subject
prior to the interview so that you don’t struggle
with questions and get your facts jumbled over
the course of the interview.

Have your questions at the ready. However,
don’t concern yourself with hitting all the ques-
tions or remaining steadfast to just the questions
before you. Allow yourself to go into another
direction if the conversation takes an unexpected
turn; the exchange may be even more engaging
and entertaining.

Prior to the interview, ask the subject how long
he or she is available for the interview. Some
subjects can interview for well over an hour, but
your target time should depend on your show’s
average running time, in particular your time
allotted for interviews. During the interview,
keep an eye on the time.

Thank your interview subject at the beginning
and end of your conversation. If possible let the
subject know when you’re planning to post this
interview. If you don’t know, tell the subject you
will send him or her an e-mail when you know
the date the interview will be available.
Interviewing Unconventional
Experts
When searching for guests to feature on your pod-
cast, nothing is wrong with having guests that peo-
ple wouldn’t normally consider “experts” on the
topic at hand.

Practice 38: Talk to Me: Interviews
298
How you find these potential interview subjects?
Check out Web sites, printed biographies, and blogs.
Accomplished authors, noted celebrities, and
authorities of all kinds often mention in their biogra-
phies their interests outside of what established
them as experts in their fields. Along with authors
who serve as keynote speakers for universities and
corporate functions and actors who are branching
out into writing, you have doctors who are martial-
arts black belts, school teachers who are rock’n’roll
musicians . . . all kinds of fascinating folks are out
there waiting for you. 
You can discover quite a bit about potential
interview subjects by surfing Web sites and
tracking certain blogs; and from there, an
interview that may take your audience (and
you) by surprise can occur.
For example, suppose that your podcast’s topic of
discussion is applied technology in the corporate
world. Who would make a great interview for
advancements in the work environment? How about
an award-winning science fiction author? Robert J.
Sawyer, when he is not writing award-winning books,
lectures in Canada and the United States about this
very topic.
Or say you have a podcast about writing, and you
want to talk about the process of writing a graphic
novel from the ground up. How is the process of
writing graphic novels different from writing novels?
How do you avoid losing key elements in transition-
ing from an idea on paper to a visual one? You know
who would be a good guest to have on your podcast
about this? Richard Hatch (shown in Figure 38-1).
Yes, as in the Classic Captain Apollo and Tom Zarek
from Battlestar Galactica. Richard Hatch is also an
accomplished writer, currently working on The Great
War Magellan, a project that is in the works to be
released as a graphic novel.
• Figure 38-1: In the casual atmosphere of Farpoint 2007,
Tee interviewed actor Richard Hatch about
his experiences as a writer for both novels
and the gaming industry.

Part VI
Creating a Video
Podcast

Video Podcasting
V
ideo production in the late 1990s was just beginning to break
into the home consumer and amateur filmmaker market, but 
getting your computer and your home (or office) equipped with
Hollywood-grade hardware usually involved bank loans and a hope that
you might break even with what you’d just invested. These days, cine-
matic special effects, professional-grade cameras, and the capability to
produce broadcast-quality video have all become commonplace. Digital
video technology is affordable, and creative minds are exploring the pos-
sibilities of podcasting their videos to content-hungry audiences around
the world.
So, in a nutshell, yes, video podcasting poses many more challenges and
many more demands. The end results, though, are worth it all! 
Understanding the Demands 
of a Video Podcast
Video demands a lot of time and attention not only from its audience but
also from its creators. Similar to enhanced podcasting (described in
Practice 24), video podcasting is a step up in production and more chal-
lenging than producing standard audio podcasts. 
There’s no denying that enhanced podcasting is very, very cool. Unlike
enhanced podcasts put together in GarageBand 3 or Podcast Factory,
video podcasts are not easy to do. Impossible, no. But easy? Hardly,
especially when working with various camera angles, lighting, ambient
noise, and so on. The advantages of the video podcast are similar to the
enhanced podcast in that you have a captive audience and you are
appealing to the visual senses. The video you are providing is content
found nowhere else, and unlike webisodes (exclusive mini-episodes of tel-
evision shows like Monk and The Office) viewable only online or televi-
sion episodes purchased via iTunes, video podcasts are free and reside
in your iTunes library or on your iPod until you decide otherwise.

In effect, no multitasking is allowed if users want to
get the most out of the podcast. Besides, because it’s
video, it demands attention — audiences have to pay
close attention to their iPods (or iPhones) or iTunes.
Potential subscribers may reconsider subscribing
to your podcast as the difference between watching
your podcast and a new television show premiering
on Showtime, The Discovery Channel, or NBC.
Playback devices, audience commitment level, and
accessibility are only the beginning of what you’ll be
facing in your list of demands in video podcasting.
In this section, we take a closer look at some addi-
tional considerations for your new video venture.
Lighting
Unlike audio — recorded just about anywhere, at
any time in the comfortable, swanky settings of a
dimly lit studio — video needs light of some kind so
you can see what you’re shooting. Even nighttime
video needs some kind of “lighting” (be it digital,
infrared, or some other means), so now you have
lighting issues to contend with. For your video pod-
cast, here are a few issues to consider to light your
way to good lighting:

Where are your principal light sources?
Fluorescent light easily fills a room but plays
havoc with actors’ skin tones, fabric colors, and
the general warmth of a room. Natural lighting
may produce vibrant colors and realistic looks
for on-screen talent, but that means placing your
show’s lighting in the chancy hands of Mother
Nature. Lighting, whether natural or otherwise,
directly affects how your talent looks. 
Take a look at the lighting of an episode of 24
(studio lighting, accent on shadow, and so on)
and then compare it to the film Sleepy Hollow,
where only natural light was used to light the tal-
ent. Then think about how to use light in your
own podcast. Are your light sources true to
the look and feel you want? Also, consider how
your principal light sources affect the look of
the show hosts or talent. Which leads us to the
next point . . . 
In the same vein as enhanced podcasts, most video
podcasts will play only on iTunes (for the desktop
computer) and iPods (portable players), depending
on the compression format you decide on. Video
podcasting doesn’t rely on any particular platform,
but it is reliant on the playback device. Do you want
it playing back on iTunes, by default? QuickTime? Or
Windows Media Player? Your choice of format limits
how audiences can subscribe to and (in this case)
watch your podcasts. 
Video podcasts, unlike enhanced podcasts however,
can be created using a variety of applications run-
ning on Windows or Mac OS X. You can use Apple
iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Apple Final Cut Pro
(shown in Figure 39-1), or Adobe Premiere Pro to
create your episode. (See Chapters 40 and 41 for
more on Premiere and Final Cut Pro.) With Final Cut
and iMovie, you can export your video podcast
directly to a format optimized for the iPod. With a
Windows application (as described in Practice 40),
there will be an extra step involving QuickTime Pro
(a $30 USD upgrade available from www.quicktime.
com) that can do the same export that Final Cut Pro
and iMovie can. (Yes, you could do the compression
by hand, but we’re big believers in letting the soft-
ware do the heavy lifting for you!) 
• Figure 39-1: Final Cut Pro from Apple is a fantastic tool
for video podcasters and makes exporting
the episode to an iPod format a breeze!
As mentioned with enhanced podcasting, your audi-
ence must commit to watching your video podcast.

Understanding the Demands of a Video Podcast


How’s the weather from one day to the next?
Simply put, lighting on a cloudy day differs
greatly from the lighting on a clear day. If you
can’t shoot everything in one day, will the
weather conditions be the same the next day?

Are you filming (or are you able to film) at con-
sistent times of the day? The position of the
sun is very different between 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and
5 p.m. Sure, that point may seem obvious, but
when you’re filming, you may think in passing,
“Yeah, we still have light.” You do, but how are
the shadows being cast? Do you have the same
intensity of light as you did in earlier shots? You
have a few more considerations when using
nature as your light designer.

If you are investing in lighting, what kind of
lighting is it? Make sure you have enough of
this lighting to give your podcast the right
amount of warmth and depth. (See “Lighting fix-
tures,” later in this practice.) 
Set and wardrobe
Audio creates a theatre of the mind. With the right
amount of Foley and effects (described in Practice
19), you can create any kind of setting — museum
corridor, waterfront warehouse, deck of a pirate
ship — but with video, if you don’t have direct
access to a desired setting, you have to build it or
find the closest likeness to what you picture for the
scene. 
After finding the right setting, you need to decide
whether you need props for your video podcast. If
so, what is appropriate for your production? Will the
host or screen talent get an opportunity to work
with them beforehand or not?
Finally, you need to think about wardrobe. What will
your on-screen talent be wearing? Audio gives pod-
casters the luxury of podcasting in whatever they
are most comfortable in wearing. Khaki shorts?
Pajamas? Au naturel? Whatever you want to do, you
can do because it’s audio — all the visuals are in
your listeners’ heads. With video, keep the following
wardrobe considerations in mind:

Stark whites can cause problems such as overex-
posure and ghosting of video. They can also be
extremely difficult to light on account of glare,
and even harder to watch. 

Stripes and plaids are horrific choices, especially
when you are attempting to set a visual balance
between the subject’s wardrobe and the setting.

When more than one host or actor is introduced
into the podcast, the participants’ clothing needs
to work well together. You don’t want it to clash,
making for distracting colors (for example, a for-
mal party setting where everyone is in black
tuxedos, but one guy shows up in a pastel-
colored tux). 

If you are working with blue- or green-screen
mattes for special effects, this will dictate what
your talent will be wearing in the production.
Blue- or green-screen is where talent is placed in
front of a backdrop of brilliant blue or lime-
green, and a different backdrop or setting is
placed behind them. Films such as Sky Captain
and The World of Tomorrow and 300 were able to
create “virtual sets” this way, but this also meant
that the actors were prohibited from wearing
shades of blue or green, which might destroy the
illusion of the new setting.
On-screen persona and appearance
You might hear people jokingly say, “I have a face for
podcasting . . . ,” which is simply a variation on an
old radio-industry joke.
Cruel but true: When you’re video-podcasting, you
have to evaluate the podcast’s on-screen talent with
visual impressions in mind:

How does your talent look? This doesn’t mean
that your video podcast should be a “pretty peo-
ple” parade, but the talent being filmed should
accurately portray your podcast’s image.

How relaxed and natural are they on camera?
You want your show host or company of actors
to be relaxed, focused, and natural when on-
camera, not tense and wooden. If your subjects
appear uncomfortable, your audience may also
feel uncomfortable watching your podcast.

Practice 39: Video Podcasting
304
Keeping it simple is the Ninja way
One fantastic way of avoiding the problems of set, make-
up, appearance, and (to some extent) lighting, is to dress
your host in a ninja costume, shoot him or her from the
waist up, and change the camera angles and tightness of
close-ups in post-production.
Sound a little crazy? Who would watch such a podcast?
Quite a few — as one ninja and his crew at Beatbox Giant
discovered.
Ask a Ninja (shown in the following figure) is a five- to ten-
minute video podcast hosted by . . . well, a ninja. In these
five to ten minutes, the mysterious, masked host gives his
take on television, politics, film, and just about anything
people are asking him about. The end result is a hysterical
monologue delivered with a katana-sharp wit and fall-over-
dead-with-laughter timing.
Part of Ask a Ninja’s success can be attributed to the show’s
simplicity of concept: a host in a ninja costume, a static
backdrop, basic lighting, one camera . . . and that’s it.
Where Ask a Ninja becomes a challenge is in its host.
Without props, makeup, sets, or any other visuals, all the
attention is on him. So, before following the way of the
ninja, be certain you have the confidence, the talent, and
the timing to pull off that kind of simplicity in your podcast.

What kind of makeup do you need? Yes, even
for the guys — makeup. Studio lights can catch
glares off a person’s skin, throwing off the white
balance of your video equipment. Also, particu-
larly as high-definition video grows in promi-
nence, you have to watch for slight skin
imperfections that stage makeup can correct
temporarily. 
Makeup brings its own questions and decisions:
Do you have a makeup artist on your staff, or
will you rely on the actors to provide their own
makeup? If they do their own makeup, are the
actors consistent in how they look? Is one host’s
makeup heavy and the other’s nonexistent?
Along with a balance in the wardrobe, there
should be a balance in the makeup as well.
Podcast file size
Now we address the file itself. A standard audio pod-
cast of roughly 28MB will cover around 30 minutes
(so if you round up, 1MB = 1 minute). For many lis-
teners, 30 minutes of audio is a lot to take in, partic-
ularly when compared to other podcasts that are far
more economical in their running times.
With video, 28MB might buy you three minutes,
depending on the compression settings. If you have
a 30-minute podcast and are expecting to get your
file down to the same size (or thereabouts), well . . .
that just won’t happen.
Keep in mind that video demands a lot more in play-
back because it’s playing audio and moving images
(29.97 images in one second of video, to be exact),
and the audio data and video data also need to say
in sync with one another. All these factors will cost
you in data size and storage.

Bandwidth demands
As discussed elsewhere in this book, bandwidth can
be costly, especially if your podcast is 50MB or
higher per download. If you garner over 1,000 listen-
ers, for example, you’ve gone through 5GB simply
for that file transfer. If these 1,000 listeners are going
through your archives, the bandwidth your podcast
is burning through increases exponentially.
Now, suppose you decide to go for the longer run-
ning times for your podcast — and even dare to
explore the possibilities of high-definition video
podcasting. What happens? Your first episode is
100MB — a very hefty download.
It’s even heftier if your podcast is a runaway success
and you have 2,000 subscribers. In one week, you
have used 200GB — and that’s your first week. What
about the weeks — and the listeners — to come?
Depending on the kind of podcast you want to pro-
duce and the audience you want to win over, you’ll
want to plan for the bandwidth demands.
Particularly with long video podcasts, bandwidth is
the sharpest of double-edged swords. You want the
podcast to be a success, but that success means you
have to work more bandwidth into your operations
budget.
Giving Yourself Enough 
Time to Produce
Producing even a weekly audio podcast — especially
if it requires a lot of editing and post-production — 
is a grueling schedule to keep. This is why, before
launching your first podcast, you should have five
episodes already completed and prepared for online
distribution. By the time you have five in the can,
you’ll know the demands of your podcast up front.
Video podcasting, no matter how simple the produc-
tion, can also be a chore — especially because video
gives you much more to contend with than audio
does. The reality of video podcasting is that podcasts
like Ask A Ninja, Tiki Bar TV, and Stranger Things
make this kind of podcasting look easier than it is. 
Many of the video podcasts in production that domi-
nate the iTunes top rankings have a crew involved
or are simply television segments repackaged and
distributed as video podcasts. If you are launching a
video podcast independent of a studio, production
house, or network, you may find the weekly sched-
ule tough to follow; even with a support crew
involved, a weekly schedule is nothing less than
intense for everyone involved. By the time one
episode is done, another one is already submitted
for logging and rough cuts. Video podcasts may
even shoot two episodes in one session, doubling
the workload for crews as well as cast.
While nonlinear video applications such as Adobe
Premiere Pro and Apple Final Cut have dramatically
improved the productivity needed for video pod-
casting, it’s still far from a pushbutton technology.
Even with simple applications such as iMovie, you
need lots of time to render the video and then out-
put it in the desired format — be it podcasting, full-
screen video, or DVD. Video created overnight or at
the eleventh hour can be riddled with mistakes, con-
tinuity errors, sloppy edits, and small trips and tum-
bles that can affect the impression of the video. 
The bottom line is that when you’re making the deci-
sion to go video, make sure you give yourself time to
shoot, time to edit, time to render, and time to
review. Log in the time dedicated to those first five
episodes of your video podcast — and from there,
make the judgment call on what you want your pod-
cast’s posting schedule to be.

Suppose that your video podcast is a go, but you
want to make sure your set is ready for filming.
Along with prepping the set, you’ll want to have
your notes organized and ready for your day of

shooting. As there can be more to an audio podcast
than just a microphone and a recording application,
a video podcast can be more than just a miniDV
camera and a video editor.
Lighting fixtures
If you’re planning to shoot indoors, the natural light-
ing coming in from outside may not be enough to
illuminate your set and talent. This is when you
need to go shopping for different lighting fixtures. 
On-camera lighting can remedy a lot of indoor light-
ing issues, but it can also produce hard shadows on
set pieces and background. You can invest in direc-
tional lights that stand on tripods (as in Figure 39-2)
and then use reflectors to diffuse the light. (Reflectors
are shiny umbrellas that soften the light being sent
out by the directional units. This will effectively light
your subject without creating harsh glares or shad-
ows.) You can get many of these lights and acces-
sories in kits, but the kits can be extremely costly,
depending on what you need and what you want for
your podcast.
Digital recorders
On-camera recording devices can be very good, but
when your subjects are more than 2 feet away from
the camera, their voices will sound hollow. This is
why it is a good idea to record your sound on a dif-
ferent device than the video and then sync up the
digitally recorded sound in post with your video.
Recording devices can be in plain view and part of
the set, or you can use a mic attached to a boom
(a horizontal support that suspends the mic over
the on-screen talent, as shown in Figure 39-3). By
capturing the sound independently, you can create a
clear reproduction of the audio instead of having to
rely on built-in camera microphones (which tend to
pick up additional room ambience).

When using boom mics, it can be difficult to
determine how low can you position the
microphone before it is visible on-screen. On
many miniDV and HD-DV cameras, the view
screen has two sets of boxes visible. The out-
side box is known as an Action-Safe Margin,
and the inside box is the Title Safe Margin,
as shown in Figure 39-4. If your boom mic is
outside of the Action-Safe Margins, the micro-
phone will not be seen because anything
beyond that margin is cropped out. Using the
Title Safe margins during your shoots gives
you an idea where captions and IDs will be
placed in post-production. In both Premiere
and Final Cut, you can view Action and Title
Safe Margins — and place text accordingly —
or enlarge the video in order to crop out any
unexpected “mic in picture” moments.
• Figure 39-4: Action Safe and Title Margins appear in both
Final Cut (pictured here) and Premiere in
order to give you an idea of what televisions
will display and what will be cropped out. 
Tripods
While The Blair Witch Project has been picked on,
parodied, and poked fun at, it was an innovative film
because it was primarily shot with hand-held cam-
eras. Coupled with the incredible hype of the film, its
accomplishments were impressive: An independent
film shot and produced on a podcaster’s budget earned
millions at the box office. Some of its success can be
attributed to the unsteadiness of the hand-held cam-
era, which became an effective way to heighten the
scary realism of the movie. However, if you’d rather
not take the “reality TV” approach to your video pod-
casting, tripods are a terrific investment for your
camera equipment. 
When shopping for tripods, you will probably notice
$10 tripods propped next to a $100 tripod stand.
Videographers will tell you, “Your video will look like
it was shot on a $10 tripod.”
The higher-grade tripods are more stable, you can
more easily pan the camera while filming, and their
meters allow you to achieve more level angles for a
camera on uneven ground (see Figure 39-5 for an
example). Look at all the functions offered — and
then consider what kind of tripod will work best for
your video podcast.
• Figure 39-5: On the set of Stranger Things (www.
strangerthings.tv), tripods like the one
pictured here ensure still, stationary shots.

Practice 39: Video Podcasting

Shooting schedules
A daily shooting schedule is important not only for
you but for your cast and crew as well. Will you be
shooting the podcast in a linear fashion, or will you
be shooting (for example) specific interviews or
scenes based on the availability of the subjects or
cast members involved?
Shooting schedules are a real benefit to your video
podcast. They make clear to you and your company
(or, if you’re a one-stop shop for a podcast, just you)
what the agenda is for the day and what you’re going
to accomplish with the available time, light, and
resources. They also serve as hard-copy progress
reports for you on what you’ll be shooting, what you
accomplish, and what you need to reschedule if
something isn’t quite right. Shooting schedules are
your road map for the day. Implement them.
Putting together a shooting schedule “just for a
video podcast” may seem a bit excessive, but if you
want to take your video podcast up a notch from
Public Access television or the often-mentioned
Wayne’s World, the effort is worth it. The podcast
you create is as professional as you make it, and by
applying some of the Hollywood approaches to
things (lighting, makeup, shooting schedules), you
can make the video-podcasting experience a posi-
tive and productive one. To find out more about
working in video on a shoestring budget (Wow, you
got it in your budget for new shoestrings?!), check
out Stephanie Cottrell Bryant’s Videoblogging For
Dummies (Wiley).
When to Say, “That’s a Wrap!”
Whether you are using Adobe Premiere Pro or Apple
Final Cut Pro (covered in Practices 40 and 41), 
you’ll have a good idea of the planning and produc-
tion demands of a video podcast after editing 20 
seconds (okay, 20 and some change) of video. Video
production may seem like a lot of hard work, but it
might surprise you when you edit your first video
and then note the episode’s running time. Time flies
not only when you edit video but also when you
review your work. You think, “I’m halfway through
my first episode . . .,” and suddenly notice that your
podcast is nearing the 20-minute mark.
As with any podcast (video or otherwise), brevity is
the soul of wit. As discussed earlier in this practice,
video demands more production time and — after
posting — more storage and bandwidth. So, before
launching your video podcast, it may be a good idea
to look at your first episode (not the first five
episodes, but the very first episode you complete in
your choice video editor) and consider the produc-
tion schedule you’re creating as well as the commit-
ment you’re asking from an audience.
Many independently produced video podcasts
rarely break the ten-minute ceiling for their running
times. These quick, down-and-dirty podcasts are the
most popular video podcasts. Shows like the earlier
mentioned Tiki Bar TV (http://tikibartv.com),
Ask a Ninja (http://askaninja.com), and The
Onion News Network (http://theonion.com) are
easy (and yes, we’re using “easy” as a relative term
here) to produce on a regular basis, can require
very little in terms of production demands, and are
fast downloads for subscribers.
The short-and-sweet video podcasts demand less of
a commitment from the viewing audience. A sub-
scriber can watch a few video podcasts on a work
break or maybe sneak in a “viewing block” when
stuck in rush hour traffic. A video podcast’s short
running time is one aspect of a show’s popularity, be
it an audio or a video podcast. If you can keep the
running time of your podcast to ten minutes or less,
your listenership can be dramatically larger than
that of a podcast that sports episodes running
45 minutes to an hour on average. 

When to Say, “That’s a Wrap!”

The Doctor is in!
Tiki Bar TV (shown in the following figure) was one of the
early adopters of podcasting with video, and with every
episode, this company of wayward actors has taken an
unlikely ten minutes to incredible heights of slapstick
humor and special effects.
Perhaps Tiki Bar’s finest moment concerning what you can
do with video podcasting on a writing, performance, and
post-production level was “Episode 20: The Son of the
Internet.” In just seven minutes, this episode managed to
parody the overnight development of technology, soap
operas, the Internet, Internet-speak, and the Disney film,
Tron. 
Oh, and the episode teaches you how to make the “Short
Fuse” cocktail. All this, in seven minutes.
With the improv, blooper-esque chuckles, and creative
mixology at the bar, Dr. Tiki, Johnny Johnny, and La La
produced an impressive (and extremely funny) installment
of Tiki Bar TV — and proved just what you can accomplish
in a short video podcast.
Shorter running times always equate to larger
audiences because audiences can quickly con-
sume an episode or two and then return to
the podcast later in the day, week, or month,
and consume another few episodes.
The major downside of the short podcast is that you
have little to no room to explore tangents, establish
subplots in your episodes, or introduce a large num-
ber of characters, guests, or show hosts without
taking the chance of cramming too much in a single
episode. Podcasts that keep it quick and brief also
keep it simple. 
And when you see longer podcasts like Stranger
Things (http://strangerthings.tv), Missing
Pages (http://speaking-pictures.com/
missingPages.html), and Martial Arts Explorer
(http://martialartsexplorer.thepodcast
network.com), the advantages (and the rewards) of
longer running times and intense video production
become clear. After you find the desired effect of
your video podcast, commit to it; but make certain
you are putting in the right amount of time and
effort for your video podcast. The end result,
whether brief or epic in its presentation, will be
worth the investment.

Editing Your Video
Podcast with Adobe
Premiere
A
dobe Premiere Pro is one of the first applications to affordably
bring the art of video editing to the home computer. Some high-
end video-editing software programs (and their accompanying
systems) cost tens of thousands of dollars, but Adobe Premiere costs
less than $800. Its nonlinear editing capabilities are used widely for creat-
ing video in-house for broadcast, podcast, and other means of distribu-
tion. (In-house means that instead of farming out the video for editing
elsewhere, the video is produced and output at your place of work, in
your home, or by you personally wherever you work on it.) For in-house
Windows users, Adobe Premiere Pro is the editing tool of choice.
The curtain is up, the stage is ready, and now you’re ready to create a
diamond from the rough footage you’ve amassed. In this chapter, we
cover what you need to get started editing in Adobe Premiere Pro.
Editing Video in Adobe Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro (shown in Figure 40-1) is the must-have video editor
for Windows users, offering sharp transitions between scenes, an array of
effects, and various output formats for broadcast, podcasting, and other
forms of playback. Adobe Premiere Pro even lets you color-correct oddly
lit video footage. 
Keep in mind, this practice will not make you fluent in Premiere. This
practice assumes that you have the footage already shot, captured, and
imported into your computer. Premiere Pro has many excellent features,
but for this title, we are covering the basics of editing.
The DVD accompanying this book includes a directory for Practice 40.
The clips and titles found here are for the introduction to Man Vs. Child
(a parody of The Discovery Channel’s Man Vs. Wild), filmed by Dancing
Cat Studios and Tee Morris. With these clips, you can use Adobe
Premiere to re-create an introduction for this mockumentary.

Using two monitors, you dedicate one to 
panels and the other to the project’s Timeline
and preview. Accelerator cards are inexpen-
sive, easy to install, and only a fraction of the
investment you’d have to make if you brought
home a cinema-style display. The two-monitor
approach also puts to good use any extra
monitors you may have tucked away.
Taking the first steps with Premiere Pro
Now that you have your resources in place, you’re
ready to edit. These steps lay the foundation for
your introduction:
1.
In the Project window, find dramatic_
score.wav and double-click it.
The audio appears in the Source window.
2.
Click the Source window, and then press the
spacebar or click the Play button to review
the audio.
The Source window is where you perform simple
edits (such as designate In and Out points) and
place markers in your video for specific cues. In
this window, you are going to designate an Out
point in the audio to indicate where the theme
music ends.
3.
Click the Go to In Point button or press the
Home key on your keyboard to return to the
beginning of the audio.
If you look just under the timecode indicators
of the Source window, you should see the Zoom
Control bar. 
4.
Click and drag the right end of the Zoom
Control to the left to zoom in on your audio.
Figure 40-1 shows the Zoom Control in the
Timeline window.
5.
Press the right-arrow key once to hear the
opening drum strike. At the moment of the first
drum strike, place a marker by clicking the Set
Unnumbered Marker tool (see Figure 40-2).
With your arrow keys, you can scrub through
audio and video. Scrubbing is the process of lis-
tening and viewing audio at a user-designated

Video History 101
The term linear editing refers to video editing done
between two playback decks and a third central deck that
compiles the material into one master tape. In linear editing
studios, you can perform basic transitions (fades, wipes,
and iris transitions) from one video source to another and
(with upgrades, of course) create inset video. The downside
of linear editing is that because the edits follow a linear
progression, you have to edit the video in the exact order
of the clips you want to compile — from beginning to end.
If you want to add any new footage, you must find that
point in the video, add in the new footage, and then re-edit
the whole film from that point on. By contrast, Premiere
and Final Cut (covered in Practice 41) are nonlinear editors:
You can edit the video footage in any order you prefer. You
can add more footage (or new footage) by simply cutting,
dragging, and replacing — no re-edits required. Simply drag,
drop, and replace.
With your files in the Project window, you’re ready
to edit your footage.
If you’re working in video- or audio-editing
applications with only one monitor, you tend
to lose screen real estate inside that monitor
very quickly as all the panels, tool boxes, and
project files proliferate. An inexpensive alterna-
tive to pricey 30-inch flat-screen monitors is
to invest in a second monitor and a video
accelerator card (such as the NVIDIA
GeForce7300GT or the Radeon X1600 Pro).
Accelerators add monitor ports to your com-
puter so you can connect additional monitors.

If you need to, zoom out from your audio and
then press the spacebar to review the audio
again. 
As the audio begins to play, watch for
00:00:22;00.
In the timecode, you’ll notice semicolons in
between the numbers. The semicolons indi-
cate Premiere is working in Drop-Frame

that keeps audio and video in sync. The time-
code breaks down this way — hours; minutes;
seconds; frames. Use the timecode to keep
track of where you are in the Timeline.
7.
Just after 00:00:22;00, when you hear a gui-
tarlike instrument begin playing, stop playback.
8.
Use the arrow keys to scrub backward in your
audio to exactly 00:00:22;00.
You can see where you are in the timecode by
using the Current Timecode Indicator (the num-
bers in blue) found on the left side of the Source
window.
9.
At 00:00:22;00, click the Set Out Point but-
ton (see Figure 40-2) in the Source window or
press O on your keyboard.
You have now designated a new Out (or end)
point for your audio.
10.
In the Source window, click the Overlay Edit
button (see Figure 40-2) to place your audio in
the A1 Audio 1 Track in your Timeline.
Notice that the audio you’ve marked — and to
which you’ve given a new Out point — now
reflects those changes. This process of making
simple edits and changes before placing the file
in the timeline is called trimming.
Additionally, you will be performing Overlay edits,
where you place one track of video over audio
without changing the running time. Performing
Overlay edits is a bit like layering images in
Photoshop, only you’re doing it with video.

Finishing the video portion of the introduction
You have successfully taken your first steps toward
putting together this introduction. Now continue to
build on this project by completing the video portion:
1.
In the Project window, click the name of
Sequence 1 and change it to read Intro.
It’s a good idea to change the name so that you
can see at a glance what this sequence is.
2.
Still in the Project window, double-click the
writing.avi clip.
The clip appears in the Source window. 
3.
Click Play or press the spacebar to review
the clip.
This may seem to be some of the driest,
dullest video footage ever captured by a cam-
era on a tripod, but what you’re looking for
are some moments to use as b-roll — footage
you’ve already shot that can serve as back-
ground video for titles, establishing shots, or
montage clips (as in this opening). B-roll is
good to have on hand; if you don’t have any,
you can always find stock video footage
online, some offered for free (www.free
stockfootage.com) and some available for
purchase (www.digitaljuice.com).
In these next steps, you will trim the clips by set-
ting various In and Out points, taking only what
you need from the footage.
13.
Scrub forward to 00:00:48;17 and click the
Set Out Point button or press the O key.
Next, you need to tell Premiere that you need
only the video from this clip.
14. Click the Toggle Take Video/Audio icon once to
get the filmstrip icon (Take Video). 
In the lower-right corner of the Source window,
you see an icon of a filmstrip and an audio
speaker. This is the Toggle Take Video/Audio
option (refer to Figure 40-2). 
If you click the icon again, you get the speaker
icon (Take Audio). Click it a third time if you
want both Video and Audio. 
15.
Press the Home key on your keyboard to return
to the beginning of the timeline and then use
the Zoom slider to zoom in.
You’ll want to view it in two-second increments.
You can tell this by looking at the timeline ruler
extending across the top of the Timeline window. 
You’re viewing in two-second increments
when the numbers read 00:00:02;00,
00:00:04;00, 00:00:06;00, and so on
across the Timeline window.
16.
In the Timeline window, click and drag the
playhead (the small blue object connected to
the edit line, located in the Timeline ruler;
refer to Figure 40-1) to the right until it reaches
the marker in the audio.
This is one way to perform an Overlay edit.
17.
Click and drag the clip from the Source window
into the Program window, as shown in Fig-
ure 40-3.
When you release the mouse button, this clip
appears in the Timeline.

this your new Out point, using one of the two
methods illustrated in Step 5.
When you established the new In point in this
clip — beyond the previous In and Out points
you set back in Steps 11 through 12 — the
points were removed, and a new In point was
established. If you make new In points after
previously established Out points, Premiere
resets the clip and allows you to work outside
of an earlier-designated range. The same is
true if you set new Out points earlier in a clip
than previously established In points.
17.
Perform an Overlay edit, using one of the two
methods featured in this practice.
Note that the clip in your timeline is unaffected.
When you bring a clip from a source of video and
incorporate it into a timeline, the clip becomes
independent of the original source material.
Therefore you can make new edit points in the
original source material without affecting what is
already in play in the Timeline. The only time
clips set in the Timeline are affected is if the
original source clip’s location in the computer
changes, or if the original source clip is deleted
or replaced. Provided your source material
remains where it is logged and captured, you can
pull multiple clips from that single source.

Save your project. After saving your work,
click your Timeline window, press the Home
key on your keyboard, and press the spacebar
to review your work up to this point. 
And you’re done! Well, with the video part anyway.
You have completed the basic video edits needed
for the Man Vs. Child introduction. The next order of
business is to go through the video and set opening
titles, adjust audio levels, and incorporate voice-
overs by using a powerful recording tool built into
Premiere.
Adding titles
Opening titles are your opening credits. You can fea-
ture the production companies involved, talent, and
the title of the podcast, or just open with the title of
the podcast as you will do here. Titles can simply
appear and disappear on the screen, or they can fly
in and out of view. 
In the following steps, you not only incorporate an
opening graphic for the podcast, but also alter the
accompanying video (providing background for the
title) for extra drama:
1.
In the Timeline window, double-click the last
clip of the child’s room with the mobile in the
foreground.
By double-clicking the clip in the Timeline,
you’re now making changes to the clip in play.
Any changes you now make to the clip in the
Source window will be reflected in the Timeline. 
You can determine whether you’re working on
an original source clip or a clip from the
Timeline by looking at the source’s tab. If you

What you get is a blur effect, 15 pixels wide,
across the whole video clip. When you put the
playhead in the clip that you’re applying the fil-
ter to, you can apply changes to the filter in the
Source window and watch the changes occur in
the Program window — in real time.
5.
In the Program window, click the Go to
Previous Edit button (refer to Figure 40-2) to go
to the start of this clip. 
6.
Expand the Motion option in the Effects
Controls window.
To simulate a slight camera pan and a zoom in,
you’re going to apply keyframes to the clip and
make adjustments. Keyframes are moments you
designate in the Timeline when something is
changing. By using keyframes, you will simulate
a zoom-out of the background.
You see a button (a grayed-out stopwatch) next
to certain motion parameters (Scale, Position,
Rotation, and so on). These are your Toggle
Animation buttons, as shown in Figure 40-5.
7.
Click the Toggle Animation button for the Scale
and Position options.
8.
In the lower-left corner of the Effects Controls
window, click the Current Timecode field to
select the timecode, type in +300, and then
press Enter. 
Doing so advances you three seconds ahead in
your clip.
Active columns of diamond-shaped buttons
appear in this interface. These are the
Add/Remove Keyframe tools (see Figure 40-5);
you use them to designate keyframes in a clip
or on the Timeline.
9.
With the Motion options, establish two new
keyframes at this point by clicking the Add/
Remove Keyframes tools for Scale and Position.
Using the Motion options to add keyframes and
adjust parameters are handy ways to change
size, rotation, and opacity in a clip, as shown in
Figure 40-5.
Next to the Add/Remove Keyframes tool (the
diamond icon), you should see two triangles,
one pointing left and the other pointing right.
These are the Go to Previous Keyframe and Go
to Next Keyframe tools (see Figure 40-5). 
10.
Click the (now active) Go to Previous Keyframe
tool to go back to the first keyframes you
created. 
You can pick any of the attributes to which you
gave keyframes, and click the Go to Previous
Keyframe tool to go back to an earlier keyframe.
11.
In the Scale section of the Motion options,
move the slider to the right until it reads 165
in the Scale field.
Or simply type 165 in the field.

In the Current Timecode field (in the lower-left
corner of the Effects Controls window), type
+100 to advance one second into the title clip.
Add keyframes here as well.
4.
Click Go to Previous Keyframe in the Motion

In the Rotation section of the Motion options,
type –21 in the field and press Enter.
6.
In the Scale section of the Motion options,
move the slider to the right until it reads 525
in the Scale field.
Or simply type in 525 in the field.
7.
In the Position section of the Motion options,
type –254.1 and 614.3 into the fields to reposi-
tion the title.
The Motion interface shows a graphic represen-
tation of the changes you make — and where
they happen in the Timeline — as shown in
Figure 40-6.
8.
Click the Go to Next Keyframe tool in the
Motion options.
9.
Go to Scale and type 95 in the Scale field. 
10.
Save your project. Then press Enter to render
the video and its animation.
Fantastic! Your video is almost done. You have com-
piled the clips and completed the animation for the
title, and everything is looking good. All that
remains are the final touches with the audio. As
soon as you complete this task, the video will be
ready for exporting into a solid video-podcasting
format.
Adding the final touches
“Final touches? What? I’m not done?”
12.
Move your mouse to the Program window.
Click and drag the mouse pointer up and to the
left until the out-of-focus image of the stuffed
dog appears just off-center on your screen. 
You can also type 197.6 and 96.2 into the
Position fields to reposition the video.
13.
Save your project. Then change the size of your
windows (if necessary) in order to view the
Video 2 track above the main video you’ve
been working with.
14.
From the Project window, click and drag the
title.tif file into the Video 2 track, placing
it to the right of the playhead.
If needed, trim the clip to end with the video.
You can do this by placing your cursor on the
end of the title clip in the Timeline and clicking
and dragging its end point back to where the
footage of the child’s room ends.
15.
If needed, click and drag the playhead back to
the ending video clip of the child’s room.
The title — Man vs. Child — is now superimposed
over the soft-focus b-roll of the child’s room.
Animating the title
You now have a title for the podcast; but for even
more punch, animate it. Follow these steps to fly in
the title from off-screen:
1.
Click the Go to Previous Edit button in the
Program window to go back to the beginning
of this clip with the out-of-focus child’s room
and title. 
2.
Double-click the new title clip you just incorpo-
rated into the Timeline and then establish
keyframes (as you did in the previous section)
for the following:
 Scale
 Rotation
 Position

Editing Video in Adobe Premiere Pro
319
The transitions should appear to extend beyond
the video and audio, deeper into the Timeline.
Because there is no video here to transition to,
Premiere will render this as a Fade to Black.
5.
Save your project. Then press Enter to render
the video and its animation.
The video will play automatically, and you can
review the changes you have made.
6.
Press the Home key on your keyboard to
return to the beginning, and then click and
drag the voiceover.wav file into Audio 2.
The voiceover will be the following:
My name is Tee Morris. I am a science fiction/fan-
tasy author and podcaster. My wife has left me
alone with my two-year-old. I will show you the
skills on how to survive.
With the voiceover for this introduction in place, the
next step is to break this one long audio segment
into smaller segments — allowing precise timing for
when the voiceover comes in with the video’s
action. Here’s what those steps look like:
1.
From the Tool Palette, click the Razor Blade
tool (refer to Figure 40-1). 
It’s all about the details. You have a voiceover track
and an abrupt ending of the video. With only a few
quick edits and the application of an audio effect,
your video will be ready for the exporting and com-
pression to a video podcast format:
1.
Your playhead should be at the end of the
audio. If it is not, click and drag the playhead
to the end of the video.
2.
In the Effects window, close the open folders
and then choose Audio Transitions➪Crossfade➪
Constant Power. Click and drag this transition
to the end of the audio clip.
The end of the audio now has a transition in
place that will fade out your music on cue when
you review it, as illustrated in Figure 40-7.
3.
In the Timeline window, place your cursor at
the end of the title clip and extend it to match
with the end of the audio. Repeat this step for
the video of the child’s room.
4.
In the Effects window, close the open Audio
Transition folder and then choose Video
Transitions➪Dissolve➪Cross Dissolve. Click
and drag this transition to the end of both the
video and title clips.

2.
Look in the Timeline window and expand
the audio track, if necessary. Review the
voiceover’s waveform (the graphic representa-
tion of sound) and note the flatline gaps within
your voiceover.
These gaps of silence are where you want to
apply the Razor Blade tool. Find the first gap
between “My name is Tee Morris” and “I am a
science fiction . . . “ and click anywhere in the
pause between these two points.
3.
Repeat Step 2 throughout the voiceover clip.
When you’re finished, you should have six
clips (as shown in Figure 40-8). 
4.
Choose the Selection tool from the Tool
Palette. 
5.
Click the last audio clip, which should be
silence after “ . . . on how to survive.” Then
delete the clip by pressing Delete or
Backspace.
6.
Place your Selection tool at the beginning of
your first segment of the voiceover. Shorten
this segment in two stages:
a. Click and drag its In point closer to the begin-
ning of the audio.
b. Click and drag its Out point closer to the end of
the audio segment.
7.
Repeat these steps for the other voiceover seg-
ments so that your voiceover recording looks
like Figure 40-9.
8.
In the Timeline window’s Current Timecode (in
the upper-left corner of the Timeline window),
click to select the Timecode and type 100 to
place your playhead at 00:00:01;00. Position
the beginning of audible voiceover (where you
see something in the waveform) at this point.
9.
Click the Page Down key to advance to the
next edit point in your Timeline. Advance in
your project until you reach the In point of the
writing.avi clip.
10.
Position the In Point of the audio segment for
“I am a science fiction/fantasy author . . . ” at
the edit point.
11.
Using the Page Down key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee and
his daughter mugging for the camera. Move the
“My wife has left me alone . . . ” audio to begin
at this point.
12.
Using the Page Down key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee shot
at the angle of a “follow camera.” Move the
“I’m going to show you the skills . . . ” audio to
begin at this point.

Using the Page Down key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee’s
daughter. Move the “On how to survive” audio
to begin at this point.
14.
Press the Home key to return to the beginning
of the Timeline.
15.
Go to the Tool Palette and select the Pen tool
(refer to Figure 40-1).
This is the tool used for placing control points in
the audio.
16.
With the Pen Tool, click at the beginning of the
audio to establish your first control point.
You can always zoom in using the Zoom slider
and do more detailed work in tighter time incre-
ments without severe eye/neck/back strain. Take
advantage of that Zoom slider when you can!
17.
In the Timeline’s Current Timecode field, type
100. Using the Pen Tool, click here to establish
your next control point.
18.
Place your Pen Tool on top of this new control
point.

322
You’ll notice that the Pen Tool icon becomes a
large plus sign (+). Now you can adjust the point
to a new volume. 
19.
Click and drag this control point to –16 dB.
Using the audio editors and the control points,
you have adjusted the volume to be softer when
the voiceover begins.
20.
Save your project. Then press Enter on your
keyboard to render a preview of the video. 
The video plays automatically.
Congratulations! You’re done! Your video is edited,
complete with fade-outs, titles, and now voiceovers.
All that’s left to do is export the video for podcast-
ing purposes.
Exporting Your Video for
Podcasting
Here we’re assuming you’re exporting to iTunes.
Before you do, remember that iTunes accepts video
for playback the following formats:

.mp4

.m4v

.mov
Just because iTunes can play a video doesn’t
mean that your iPod can follow suit. To play
on an iPod, the video must be compressed in
a certain way. So far you’ve gotten a good
start on preparing your Premiere files for
podcasting.
Here are the tech specs that your video has to meet
before you can export it from Premiere:

A screen resolution not to exceed 640 × 480
(4:3 standard ratio) or 640 × 360 (16:9 widescreen
ratio)

30 fps (frames per second)

H.264 codec (either 1.5 Mbps or 768 kbps)
A codec is compression for video. Many video
codecs are available. For video podcasting, you
will be using H.264.

48 Khz, stereo audio
The end result is a file with the .m4v extension —
and that means you have a video that’s ready for
video podcasting. 
To export that file from Premiere, here’s what you
need to do:
1.
Click anywhere in your Timeline window and
choose File➪Export➪Adobe Media Encoder to
access the Adobe Media Encoder.
2.
Choose Format➪QuickTime.
The Adobe Media Encoder (shown in Fig-
ure 40-10) is a built-in video compressor that
gives you myriad options for exporting your
video for DVD, podcasting, or online downloads.
3.
In the Video Codec section, select the codec
H.264.
4.
In the Basic Video Settings section, change the
Frame Width to 320 and the Frame Height to
240. Scroll down to just underneath the Basic
Video Settings to see Bitrate Settings. Set
Bitrate Settings to 128. 
5.
In the Export Settings section, click the disc
icon to save this new preset. In the Choose
Name window that appears (see Figure 40-11),
label these settings Video Podcasting.
6.
Click OK to accept the new preset you’ve cre-
ated and then click OK to begin encoding.

Exporting Your Video for Podcasting
323
• Figure 40-10: The Adobe Media Encoder.
7.
Import the .mov file you just created into
iTunes. iTunes will list it under Movies. Right-
click it and select Convert Selection for iPod.
8.
Right-click the new video that iTunes just cre-
ated and then choose Get Info➪Info to edit and
complete ID3 tags.
And that’s it. You’re done creating your first video
podcast episode in Adobe Premiere Pro. The steps
may seem numerous, but nonlinear editing quickly
becomes second nature as you do it. From here, you
can now shoot, edit, and produce your podcast at
will. Good luck!
Apple’s QuickTime (www.quicktime.com)
is regarded as a Mac thing — but a Windows
version of the popular media player is avail-
able. Also, for an upgrade of $30 USD, the QT
Player can be upgraded to a QT Pro version.
The Pro version offers extra features, not the
least of which is exporting video and audio to
various formats (including Export to iPod).
Instead of the multistep process we outlined
previously, you can prepare a file for podcast-
ing in a matter of a few clicks. For more on
this nifty procedure, look at Practice 41.

Editing Your Video
Podcast with Apple
Final Cut Pro
I
n 2000, Apple entered the nonlinear editing market with Final Cut Pro
to stand toe-to-toe with the major players of video editing. Today, Final
Cut Pro continues to gain ground; it’s a contender for becoming a new
standard in video editing. With tons of drag-and-drop capabilities for
video editing, an easy-to-follow export process, and the functions of Final
Cut Studio 2’s supporting cast members (Soundtrack Pro, Motion, and so
on) bundled with it, this application is ready to deliver video podcasting
in a matter of a few mouse clicks. At $1,300 USD, the Final Cut Studio may
give you sticker shock, but we’re talking pro-level tools here. When you
consider the other applications bundled with it, you get a lot in that
beautiful black box for that price. If it’s still too pricey for your taste, you
can pony up $299 USD for Final Cut Express HD, which offers the basics
for video podcasters at an affordable price.
Welcome to nonlinear editing, Apple style!
Editing Video with Final Cut Pro
Final Cut Pro from Apple, part of the Final Cut Studio 2 suite, offers an
elegant and efficient interface (as shown in Figure 41-1). The exporting
options for video editors make the editing process easy.
On the companion DVD, you will find a directory for Practice 41. The
clips and titles are for the introduction to Man vs. Child, a parody of The
Discovery Channel’s Man vs.Wild (filmed by Tee Morris and Dancing Cat
Studios). With these clips, you will re-create the opening of this spoof
with Final Cut.

Getting ready to edit the video podcast
The following steps help you set up your computer
for video editing and audio recording with Final Cut.
You will be importing clips and even confirming that
Final Cut sees your audio recording hardware so
that you can record live into the project. So just take
a few preliminary steps here before editing:
1.
If you have audio recording equipment set up
for your computer, confirm that your setup is
your source of audio input. To do so, choose
System Preferences➪Sound➪Input and select
your mixer board.
Figure 41-2 shows what this process looks like.
With the mixer set as your default audio input
source, you can record live voiceovers directly
into your Final Cut project with ease.

6.
In the Practice 41 bin, find the MvC-intro_
final.m4v file. Either in QuickTime or in
Final Cut, review the file so you know what
your final file should look like.
With your files in the Browser window, you’re ready
to edit your footage.
If you’re working in video- or audio-editing
applications with only one monitor, you tend
to lose screen real estate inside that monitor
very quickly because all the panels, tool
boxes, and project files proliferate. An inex-
pensive alternative to pricey 30-inch flat-
screen monitors is to invest in a second
monitor and a video accelerator card (such as
the NVIDIA GeForce7300GT or the Radeon
X1600 Pro). Accelerators add monitor ports to
your computer so you can connect additional
monitors. Using two monitors, you dedicate
one to panels and the other to the project’s
timeline and preview. Accelerator cards are
inexpensive, easy to install, and are only a
fraction of the investment you’d have to make
if you brought home a cinema-style display.
The two-monitor approach also puts to good
use any extra monitors you may have tucked
away.
Laying the foundation of your video 
with Final Cut Pro
All the resources needed for this video (with the
exception of the voiceover that you will record
later) are now waiting for you in the Browser win-
dow. In the following steps, you bring in the theme
music and perform the first edit for this project:
1.
Find dramatic_score.aif in the Browser
window and double-click it. When the audio
appears in the Viewer window, click the
Viewer window and then press your spacebar
or click the Play button to review the audio.
You will place a marker and designate an Out
point in this audio to indicate where the video
begins and where the theme ends.
• Figure 41-2: Making your mixer the default source for
audio input. 
2.
Copy the Practice 41 folder from the com-
panion DVD onto your Macintosh.
3.
Launch Final Cut Pro.
4.
Choose File➪Import➪Folder and import the
Practice 41 folder. 
The folder appears in the Browser window of Final
Cut Pro. The Browser window is where you can
organize all the resources that make up your edit-
ing project. You can create bins, access video and
audio clips, and manage sequences from here.
5.
Expand the Practice 41 bin (the editing term
for a folder) so you can review its contents:

2.
In the Viewer window, click Go to Previous
Edit (see Figure 41-1) or press the Home key on
your keyboard to return to the beginning of
the audio. 
3.
Click and drag the Zoom Control to the left to
zoom in on your audio.
The Zoom Control (identical to the Timeline
Zoom Control) is located in the lower-left corner
of the waveform, as shown in Figure 41-1.
4.
Press your right-arrow key once to hear the
opening drum strike. At the moment of the first
drum strike, place a marker by either clicking
the Add Marker tool or pressing the M key.
With your arrow keys, you can scrub through
audio and video. Scrubbing is the process of
listening and viewing audio at a user-desig-
nated speed. You scan through segments, find
what you’re looking for, and make edits. This
capability makes zooming in especially useful
for syncing specific moments of audio to
video (as shown in Figure 41-3).
5.
Zoom out on your audio and then press the
spacebar to review your audio again. Just after
00:00:22;00, you will hear a guitarlike instru-
ment begin playing. Stop playback there.
6.
Using the arrow keys, scrub back in your audio
to exactly 00:00:22;00. 
You can see where you are in the timecode by
checking the Current Timecode Field in the
upper-right corner of the Viewer window.
You may notice that Final Cut Pro has a
strange way of measuring time with a number
separated by colons (like a normal clock) and
the last two numbers separated from the oth-
ers by a semi-colon (not so normal). This
Timecode is a variation of Drop-Frame
Timecode, a method of timing that keeps
audio and video in sync. Keeping it simple,
the timecode breaks down this way — hours;
minutes; seconds; frames. And your video is
moving at 29.97 frames per second (fps). This
is what keeps audio and video running
together in your project.
7.
At 00:00:22;00, click the Mark Out Point 
button in the Viewer window’s interface (as
shown in Figure 41-4) or press O on your 
keyboard.
You’ve designated a new Out (or end) point for
your audio.
8.
In the Viewer window, click and drag the Take
Audio icon (a small speaker with a hand on
top) into the A1 Audio Track in your Timeline.
Note that the audio you’ve marked up and given
a new Out point to reflects your changes. The
process of making simple edits and changes to
the media file before placing it in the Timeline is
called trimming.
Your score is in place. You can now begin placing
video in the Timeline.

13.
Press the Home key on your keyboard to return
to the beginning of the Timeline, and then
zoom in to your audio with the Zoom Control.
You will want to view your audio in 2-second
increments. You can determine this by looking
at the Timeline Ruler extending across the top
of the Timeline window. 
You’re viewing audio in 2-second increments
when the numbers read 01:00:02;00,
01:00:04;00, 01:00:06;00, and so on.
14.
To the left of the Zoom Control is the Toggle
Timeline Track Height feature (refer to Fig-
ure 41-1). Select the viewing option that’s 
second from the right.
The Track Height viewing options for your clips
are similar to those found in Soundtrack Pro.
They make editing audio and video easier.
15.
Click the playhead in the Timeline window
(the small yellow triangle in the Timeline
Ruler; refer to Figure 41-1) and drag it to the
right until it snaps to the marker in the audio.
16.
Click the Viewer window and then click and
drag the clip from the Viewer into the Canvas
window.
An interface appears that gives you options you
can use to incorporate the clip. 
17.
Drag the clip into the Overwrite option and
then release the mouse button (as shown in
Figure 41-5).
The clip is now in your Timeline. Throughout
this practice, you will be performing what are
known as Overwrite edits, where you place one
track of video over audio without affecting the
running time. Performing Overwrite edits is a bit
like layering images in Adobe Photoshop, only
you’re doing it with video.
18.
Save your project either by choosing File➪Save
Project or by pressing Ú+S. 
10.
When you’ve reached the end of the clip,
use the arrow keys and scrub back to
00:00:45;06. Make this the new In point of
your video by clicking the Mark In Point button
(see Figure 41-4) or pressing I on your keyboard.
• Figure 41-4: Final Cut indicates the new In and Out points
in your video with icons in the top right and
left corners of your Viewer’s preview. In this
instance, the new Out point is indicated with
an icon in the upper-right corner.
11.
Scrub forward to 00:00:48;07 and click the
Mark Out Point button or press the O key.
This process of making simple edits and changes
before placing the file in the Timeline is called
trimming. Simply put, you’re taking only the
video you need from a longer clip and applying
it to your Timeline.
You want only the video; the next step lets Final
Cut know that.
12.
In the Timeline window, find the two interlock-
ing icons in the audio tracks: a1 (the Source)
connecting to A1 (the Destination), and a2 con-
necting with A2. (Refer to Figure 41-1.) Click
each of these icons so they disconnect from
each other, which tells Final Cut you don’t
want anything sent from the Viewer into the
Timeline. Leave v1 and V1 connected.

Finishing the video portion of the introduction
Now that you have an idea of how you bring clips
into the Timeline, you will now incorporate the
other clips into the project. We show you several
ways to perform simple edits with Final Cut.
Follow these steps to get rolling:
1.
In your Browser window, click the name of
Sequence 1 and change it to read Intro so you
know what this sequence is at a glance.
2.
Still in the Browser window, double-click the
writing.mov clip to bring it up in the Viewer
window. Click Play or press the spacebar to
review the clip.
This may seem like some of the driest, dullest
video footage ever captured by a camera on a
tripod, but what you’re looking for are some
moments to use as b-roll — footage you’ve
already shot that can serve as background
video for titles, establishing shots, or montage
clips (as in this opening). B-roll is good to have
on hand; if you don’t have any, you can always
find stock video footage online, some offered
for free (www.freestockfootage.com) and
some available for purchase (www.digital
juice.com).
3.
Find the 00:00:47;15 point in this clip’s
Timeline and mark this as the clip’s new In
point by clicking the Mark In Point tool or by
pressing I on your keyboard.
4.
Progress forward to 00:00:49;14 and mark
this clip as your new Out point by clicking
the Mark Out Point tool or by pressing O on
your keyboard.
5.
Press Ú+F10 on your keyboard to perform an
Overwrite edit.
Note that because you’ve left the Source and
Destination tracks disconnected, you’re import-
ing only video (which is all you need).

pointer over the Overwrite option to perform
the edit.
14.
Return to the Viewer window, progress to
00:01:03;05 in the clip, and make this your
new In point using one of the two methods
mentioned in Step 3.
15.
Progress to 00:01:37;07 in the clip and make
this your new Out point, using one of the two
methods mentioned in Step 4.
Note that when you established the new In point
in this clip beyond the previous In and Out
points you set back in Steps 11 through 12, the
points were removed, and a new In point was
established. If you make new In points after 
previously established Out points, Final Cut
resets the clip and allows you to work outside an
earlier-designated range. The same is true if you
set new Out points in a clip earlier than previ-
ously established In points.
16.
Perform an Overwrite edit, using one of the
three methods featured in Steps 5, 9, or 13.
Note that the clip in your Timeline is unaffected.
When you bring a clip from a source of video and
incorporate it into a Timeline, the clip becomes
independent of the original source material.
Therefore, you can make new edit points in the
original source material without affecting what is
already in play in the Timeline. Clips set in the
Timeline are affected only if the original source
clip’s location in the computer changes, or if the
original source clip is deleted or replaced.
Provided your source material remains where it
is logged and captured, you can pull multiple
clips from one single source.
17.
In the Browser window, double-click around-
house_2.mov and review the clip.
18.
Progress to 00:00:02;00 in the clip and make
this your new In point using one of the two
methods illustrated in Step 3. 
19.
Progress to 00:00:04;00 in the clip and make
this your new Out point using one of the two
methods illustrated in Step 4.
20.
Perform an Overwrite edit using one of the
three methods featured in Steps 5, 9, or 13.
Normally the Final Cut Pro Help Tags identify
the keyboard shortcut for performing an
Overwrite edit as F10. If (however) your oper-
ating system is Mac OS X and you’re running
a system program called Exposé, you’ve got a
slight conflict: Its default settings already use
F10 as part of the F9–F12 range of keys. You
have two ways to bypass the Exposé com-
mand: Hold down the Ú key while you press
F10 or (if you want to reassign the Exposé
commands) choose Ú➪System Preferences➪
Dashboard & Expose and adjust the
Preferences there. If you reassign key com-
mands or change Preferences, you can simply
follow the Help Tags that Final Cut provides.
6.
Return to the Browser window and double-
click the podcast.mov clip. Play this clip to
review it.
7.
Progress to 00:00:08;20 in the clip and make
this your new In point, using one of the two
methods mentioned in Step 3.
8.
Progress to 00:00:11;00 in the clip and make
this your new Out point, using one of the two
methods mentioned in Step 4.
9.
In the Canvas window, find the Overwrite but-
ton and click it to perform the edit.
The Overwrite button is a red icon located
between the Insert (yellow) button and Replace
(blue) button. (Refer to Figure 41-1.)
10.
In the Browser window, double-click around-
house.mov and review the clip.
From this segment, you’ll extract two clips from
one. This method is used in nonlinear editing,
and it enables you to grab multiple clips from
one long shot.
11.
Progress to 00:00:29;15 in the clip and make
this your new In point, using one of the two
methods mentioned in Step 3.
12.
Progress to 00:00:31;25 in the clip and make
this your new Out point, using one of the two
methods illustrated in Step 4.

this clip. To view the changes to this clip as
they happen, click and drag the Timeline’s play-
head back anywhere into this clip.
4.
With the Gaussian Blur filter checked, click
and drag the slider for Radius to 15. 
You get a blur effect, 15 pixels wide, across the
whole video clip. As shown in Figure 41-7, when
you put the playhead in the clip that you’re
applying the filter to, you can apply changes to
the filter in the Viewer and watch the changes
occur in the Canvas window — in real time.

Progress to 00:00:06;15 in the clip and make
this your new Out point using one of the two
ways illustrated in Step 4.
23.
Perform an Overwrite edit using one of the
three methods featured in Steps 5, 9, or 13.
24.
Save your project. 
After saving your work, click your Timeline window,
press the Home key on your keyboard, and press the
spacebar to review your work up to this point. 
Adding titles
You’ve got the basic video edits needed for your
Man Vs. Child introduction. The next order of busi-
ness is to set opening titles, adjust audio levels, and
incorporate voiceovers by using a powerful record-
ing tool built into Final Cut Pro:
1.
In the Timeline window, double-click the last
clip of the child’s room with the mobile in the
foreground.
Double-click the clip in the Timeline to make
changes to the clip in play. Any changes you now
make to the clip in the Viewer will be reflected in
the Timeline. 
You can tell whether you are working on an
original source clip or a clip from the Timeline
by looking at the Viewer’s scrubber bar. If you
see dots along the top and the bottom of
the bar, you’re working with a clip from the
Timeline (as shown in Figure 41-6, top), not the
original source (shown in Figure 41-6, bottom).
2.
From the Viewer window, select the Filters tab
to view your Filter options for this clip.
3.
In the Effects window, choose Video Filters➪
Blur➪Gaussian Blur. Click and drag this filter
into the Viewer’s Filter window to apply it to

In the Canvas window, click the Go to Previous
Edit button (refer to Figure 41-1) to go to the
start of this clip.
6.
Click the Motion tab in the Viewer window
(shown in Figure 41-8).
To simulate a slight camera pan and a zoom in,
you are going to apply keyframes to your clip
and make adjustments. Keyframes are moments
you designate in the clip’s Timeline to signify
something is changing. By using keyframes, you
can simulate a zoom-out of the background.
7.
In the Basic Motion interface, find a column
of diamond-shaped buttons — your keyframe
tools — and click the ones for the Scale and
Center options.
With these tools, you can designate key
moments in your clips where things change. 
8.
Click the Current Timecode field (in the lower-
left corner of the Motion window, as shown in
Figure 41-8) for the clip you’re working on.
9.
Type +300 and then press Enter or Return.
Doing so advances three seconds ahead in
your clip.
10.
In your Motion interface, establish two new
keyframes for Scale and Center at this point.

12.
Click the (now active) Go to Previous Keyframe
button (refer to Figure 41-8) to go back to the
first keyframes you created. 
You can pick any of the attributes you gave
keyframes to and click the tool to do this.
13.
In the Scale section of the Motion window,
move the slider to the right until it reads 165 in
the Scale field, or simply type 165 in the field.
14.
In the Center section of the Motion window,
click the plus-sign (+) icon to see the Center
point of your image and move your mouse
pointer to the Canvas window.
15.
Click and drag the pointer up and to the left
until the out-of-focus image of the stuffed dog
appears in the lower-right corner of your
screen.
Another way to reposition the video is to type
–112.8 and –68.04 into the Center fields.
16.
Save your project. Then change the size of the
windows (if necessary) so you can view the
Video 2 (V2) track above the main video you’ve
been working with.
17.
From the Browser window, click and drag the
title.tif file into the V2 track, placing it to
the right of the playhead. 
If the clip needs trimming, you can trim it to
end at the same time as the video. Place your
cursor on the end of the title clip in the
Timeline, and then click and drag its end point
to where the footage of the child’s room ends.
18.
If needed, click and drag the playhead back to
the ending video clip of the child’s room.
The title — Man vs. Child — is now superimposed
over the soft-focus b-roll of the child’s room. 
Animating your title
You now have a title for your podcast, but you still
need to animate it so it flies into the frame. That’s
the next goal; here’s how you do it:
1.
Click the Go to Previous Edit button in the
Canvas window; go back to the beginning of
this clip, the out-of-focus child’s room that
(now) shows the title. 
2.
Double-click the new title clip you just incorpo-
rated into the Timeline and then establish
keyframes (as you did in the previous steps) for
the following:
 Scale
 Rotation
 Center
3.
In the Current Timecode field in the lower-left
of the Motion window, type +100 to advance 1
second into the title clip. Add keyframes here
as well.
4.
Click Go to Previous Keyframe in the Motion
window. 
You are now at the beginning keyframes of the
title clip.
5.
In the Rotation section of the Motion window,
type –21 in the field and press Enter or Return.
6.
In the Scale section of the Motion window,
move the slider to the right until it reads 525 in
the Scale field, or simply type 525 in the field.
7.
In the Center section of the Motion window,
type –513.89 and 338.97 into the Center fields to
reposition the title. Then press Return.
The Motion interface shows a graphic represen-
tation of the changes you make — and where
they happen in the Timeline — as shown in
Figure 41-9.
8.
Click the Go to Next Keyframe button (refer to
Figure 41-8) in the Motion window.
9.
Go to Scale and type 95 in the Scale field. Then
go to the Center section, click the plus-sign (+)
icon to see the Center point of your image, and
click and drag the title to center it in your
video.
You can also type 1.39 and 14.85 into the Center
fields to reposition the title.

the final touches with the audio. As soon as you
complete the following steps, the video will be ready
for exporting into a solid video podcasting format: 
1.
With your playhead at the end of the audio,
click and drag the playhead back to the end of
the video.
2.
In the Effects window, close the open folders
and then choose Audio Transitions➪Cross
Fade (0 dB). Click and drag this transition to
the end of the audio clip. 
The end of the audio now has a transition in
place that will fade out your music on cue when
you review it, as illustrated in Figure 41-10.
3.
In the Timeline window, place your cursor
at the end of the title clip and extend it to
match the end of the audio. Repeat this step for
the video of the child’s room.
4.
In the Effects window, close the open Audio
Transition folder and then choose Video
Transitions➪Dissolve➪Cross Dissolve. Click
and drag this transition to the end of both the
video and title clips. 
The transitions should appear to extend beyond
the video and audio, deeper into the Timeline.
Because there is no video here to transition to,
Final Cut renders this as a fade to black (as
shown in Figure 41-11).
• Figure 41-9: A graphic representation of the changes
you’ve made appears in the Motion
interface.
10.
Save your project. Then press Option+R or
choose Sequence➪Render All➪Both to render
the video and its animation. 
11.
Review your work: Click inside the Timeline
window, press the Home key on your key-
board, and then press the spacebar (or click
the Play button in your Canvas window).
Adding the final touches with Final Cut
You have compiled the clips and animated the title,
and everything is looking good. All that remains are

Save your project. Then press Option+R or
choose Sequence➪Render All➪Both to render
the video, its animation, and the transitions.
Click inside the Timeline window, press the
Home key on your keyboard, and then press
the spacebar or the Play button in the Canvas
window to review your work.
6.
Press the Home key on your keyboard to
return to the beginning and then press
Option+0 or choose Tools➪Voice Over to acti-
vate the Voice Over recorder in Final Cut Pro.
Final Cut’s Voice Over tool (shown in Figure 41-12)
is a recorder built into the application itself. This
tool is a terrific feature of Final Cut Pro. You can
set it to see your mixer as an audio input device,
and you can also label the recording as Voice
Over - MvC or whatever name you wish to call
it. Final Cut Pro’s powerful built-in recorder
allows you to review video without sound,
enabling you to read scripts or voiceover seg-
ments in time with the playback of the video.
7.
In the Voice Over tool, make sure the Source
option sees your mixer or audio interface as the
incoming audio source. Select it from the menu.
If your mixer or audio interface is not offered as
an option, then save your work, quit Final Cut,
and double-check your System Preferences
(as suggested in Step 1 of the “Getting ready to
edit the video podcast” section, earlier in the
chapter). After the audio source is confirmed,
launch Final Cut Pro and pick up from this step.
(Final Cut will remember the point where you
left off in the project.)

8.
Before proceeding, go to the Browser window
and double-click writing.mov so that you
have available in the Timeline the Source and
Destination for audio. Click and drag a1
(Source) down to A3 (Destination) and click
either icon to connect them. Repeat this step
for a2 and A4. 
When you have a destination for your Voice
Over, it is time to record. 
9.
Check your levels in the Voice Over by speaking
into your mic and watching the Level section.
10.
Your script for this voiceover is as follows:
His name is Tee Morris. He is a science fiction/
fantasy author and podcaster. His wife has left him
alone with his two-year-old. Today, he will show
you the skills on how to survive.
The delivery for this should be dramatic and
tense. (Reading this in a British accent, like the
host of the Discovery Channel’s Man vs. Wild, is
strictly your call!) You can either read it along
with the video or take short one- to two-second
pauses between complete thoughts. 
11.
In the Name section of the Voice Over window,
name this voiceover file MvC VO 001. 
The file is saved in this project’s Capture
Scratch folder, labeled by the project’s name.
12.
Mute the tracks of your video’s music by click-
ing the Audible buttons (refer to Figure 41-1)
for Audio Tracks 1 and 2.
13.
When ready, click the Record button (the red
button to the left of the display currently read-
ing Ready to Record) and wait for the count-
down to cue you in. When the Recording
status shows on-screen, begin your voiceover.
As you are recording, Voice Over not only keeps
track of how much you are recording but also
counts down how much video remains, stopping
the recording automatically when the video
material concludes. Voice Over records your
voiceover on one of the Destination tracks; after
that’s done, it creates a name for a new voiceover
(in this case, MvC VO 002) and stands by for any
new audio you want to add.
The Voice Over tool allows you to adjust the
Gain (input signal) and Rate (44 kHz or 48 kHz),
but you can also adjust the level from your
mixer. When the Voice Over finishes recording,
your playhead in the Timeline immediately
returns to the beginning of your project. You can
now edit the audio as you like. 
With the voiceover in place, the next order of busi-
ness is to break up this long audio segment into
smaller ones, allowing precise timing when the
voiceover comes in with the video’s action:
1.
From the Tool Palette, click the Razor Blade tool. 
2.
Look in the Timeline window and review the
voiceover audio’s waveform (the graphic rep-
resentation of sound) and note the flatline gaps
within your voiceover. 
These gaps of silence are where you want to
apply the Razor Blade tool. Find the first gap
between “His name is Tee Morris . . .” and “He is
a science fiction . . . ” and click anywhere in the
pause between these two points. 
3.
Repeat the previous step throughout the
voiceover clip. When you’re finished, you
should have six clips (as shown in Figure 41-13).
When your six clips are complete, choose the
Selection tool from the Tool Palette. 
4.
Click the last audio clip, which should be
silence after “ . . . on how to survive.” Delete
the clip by pressing the Delete key.
5.
Click the Snapping icon or press N on your key-
board to turn off the Snapping option. 
You can find the Snapping icon in the top-
right corner of the Timeline window (refer to
Figure 41-1); it appears green when turned on. 
6.
Place your Selection tool at the beginning of
the first segment of the voiceover. Shorten this
segment by clicking and dragging its In point
closer to the beginning of the audio, and by
clicking and dragging its Out point closer to
the end of the audio segment.
7.
Repeat Steps 1–6 for all other voiceover seg-
ments so your voiceover recording looks like
Figure 41-14.

Using the down-arrow key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee and
his daughter mugging for the camera. Move the
“His wife has left him alone . . . ” audio to
begin at this point.

Using the down-arrow key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee shot
at the angle of a “follow camera.” Move the
“Today, he will show you the skills . . . ” audio
to begin at this point.

Using the down-arrow key, advance in the
Timeline to the In point to the clip of Tee’s
daughter. Move the “On how to survive” audio
to begin at this point.
15.
Press the Home key on your keyboard to
return to the beginning of the Timeline. Click
the Audible buttons to make your soundtrack
active.
16.
Go to the Tool Palette and select the Pen tool
(which has the image of a fountain pen on it). 
The Pen tool enables you to place control points
(similar to those found in GarageBand, and
Soundtrack Pro, and Premiere) in the audio.
17.
In the lower-left corner of the Timeline win-
dow, click the Toggle Clip Overlays option.
A Volume Level line extends across your audio. 
18.
With the Pen Tool, click at the beginning of the
audio to establish your first control point.
You can always zoom in using the Zoom
Control and do more-detailed work in tight
time increments — all without a hint of
eye/neck/back strain. Take advantage of that
Zoom Control when you can.
19.
In the Timeline’s Current Timecode field, type
100. Then with the Pen Tool, click here to
establish your next control point.
20.
Place the Pen tool on top of this new control
point, and you will notice that the Pen Tool
icon becomes a large plus sign (+), which
allows you to adjust the point to a new volume.
Click and drag this control point to –16 dB.
21.
Save your project. Then press Option+R or
choose Sequence➪Render All➪Both to render
the video. 
22.
Press the Home key on your keyboard and
then press the spacebar (or click the Play
button in the Canvas window) to review your
final work.
Congratulations! You’re done with the hard part.
Your video is edited, complete with fade-outs, titles,
and now voiceovers. All that’s left to do is export
the video for podcasting purposes. 
Now that you’ve completed the video, take a
look at how long it has taken you to create
this 221⁄2-second video. For a short video,
you’ve invested a good chunk of time to make
this introduction happen. Even after you get
to a level of familiarity with the software,
video editing is a time-consuming process. Be
ready to make that kind of investment. (For
more on the time demands of video podcast-
ing, take a look at Practice 39.)

Exporting Your Video for
Podcasting
As you’ve no doubt noticed, the process of video
editing can be a long trek through many, many
steps. But the beautiful thing about Final Cut Pro is
how easy it makes the process of exporting a video
specifically for podcasting. 
It really doesn’t get any easier than this:
1.
Click anywhere in the Timeline window
and choose File➪Export➪Using QuickTime
Conversion.
You are now accessing the QuickTime Conversion
tool built into the Export function of Final Cut
Pro. Much like the Adobe Media Encoder cov-
ered in Practice 40, this is a handy collection of
QuickTime presets that allows you to export
your video to a format that you need.
2.
Choose Format➪iPod.
In the Format window, the QuickTime extensions
installed with Final Cut Pro allow for a wide vari-
ety of formats — including iPod, iPhone, and
AppleTV, as shown in Figure 41-15.
3.
In the Save As field, rename the file MvC-
Intro.m4v and then click the Save button.
Surprise! That’s it. You’re done. Three steps and
you’ve created your first video for the podcasting
community. From here, you can shoot, edit, and pro-
duce your own podcast. Final Cut’s easy exporting
makes it a real friend to podcasters.
Apple recommends that the original video be at
least 640 pixels wide during the editing process;
when exporting, use the built-in iPod converters in
Compressor (H.264 for iPod), QuickTime Pro (Movie
to iPod), or iTunes (Convert Selection for iPod).
These compression settings maintain the aspect
ratio and yield podcast-ready .m4v files.
But we’re still talking basics here. This practice just
scratches the surface of this incredible video-editing
program. If you are looking to find out more about
the more-potent capabilities of Final Cut Pro, take a
look at the many titles available at your local book-
store or online. You can move through the basics
and then onward to the advanced techniques in
video production, video editing, and video editing in
Final Cut Pro.

Posting and
Distributing
Your Video
A
fter you’ve got your killer video podcast finished and ready to go,
the question asked here is usually, “Okay, now what?” It’s not a
bad question to ask, really — there are a few options you can
explore beyond the simple addition of the video to your RSS feed. You
can (for example) either post your video content exclusively into your
podcast or have another service shoulder the hosting and bandwidth
issues that come with hosting a video podcast.
Beginning with the basics, this practice explores the options you have for
releasing your video content out into the wild, including YouTube, Google
Video, and Lulu TV.
Distribution through Your Feed
If you are working with your own feed, as discussed in Practices 25 and
27, you know that the most important line in your feed is the enclosure.
As an example, here’s the enclosure line for a video called Man vs. Child:
<enclosure url=”http://mywebsite.net/podcast
/ManVsChild.m4v” length=”121774210” type=”video/
x-m4v”/>
Sure, all the other lines of your RSS feed play a part in making your pod-
cast happen, but it’s the enclosure that everyone wants — and that
everyone plays on their media players of choice. Without the enclosure,
no media file is exchanged between the host and the podcatching client,
so you will want to be certain that the feed you’re managing — whether
you’re doing it by hand, using PodPress, or having LibSyn take care of the
feed for you — has the right enclosure tag in place.
With video podcasts, the enclosure needs to be the right format and right
type in order for iTunes to recognize it and play it properly. Table 42-1
sums up the possible formats.

 For a Mac: Right-click on the video file in the
Finder and select Get Info. 
After you’ve made the selection, look for Size.
The number of bytes is your show length. Here’s
an example:
length=”121774210”
4.
Make sure the file type is the correct type.
For an m4v file, that line looks like this:
type=”video/x-m4v”
Your enclosure tag should now look like this:
<enclosure
url=”http://mywebsite.net/
podcast /ManVsChild.m4v”
length=”121774210”
type=”video/x-m4v”/>
You are ready to finish up any other episode details
in your RSS feed (including double- and triple-
checking your feed’s iTunes tags). Then you can
upload your episode to begin video podcasting.
Posting on YouTube
Perhaps you’d prefer not to host the videos yourself
because of the high bandwidth required — or
maybe you want to see how well the video will per-
form before committing yourself to a host blog and a
super-size server. That’s where a service like
YouTube (www.youtube.com) comes into play.
YouTube is an online service that streams video and
Flash animation content created by its members to
anyone and everyone who wants to watch.
Videos appearing on YouTube must fit certain tech-
nical criteria. They must be

Shorter than 10 minutes 

Smaller than 100MB

In one of these formats: .avi, .mov, .mpg, or
.wmv 
TABLE 42-1: ENCLOSURE TAG ATTRIBUTES
File Format
File Type
.mp4
video/mp4
.m4v
video/x-m4v
.mov
video/QuickTime
Although it does say on Apple’s Web site that the
.mov format (the uncompressed “movie” file usually
created from Final Cut or Premiere files when you’re
exporting with QuickTime) is a supported file for
video podcasting, this file format equates to
extremely large files. That means extremely slow
downloads. You are better off saving your files
either as the compressed .mp4 or .m4v formats, pro-
vided the compression does not affect the video’s
appearance too much. For more on compressing
your video for podcasting, refer to Practices 39, 40,
and 41 in this book.
When you’re writing or confirming the tag for your
podcast episode in your RSS-generator, consider the
following:
1.
Check the filename of your .m4v or .mp4 file
to make sure you’re matching cases, using
underscores, and have the right extension.
The Man vs. Child video filename looks like this:
ManVsChild.m4v
2.
Make certain the enclosure tag is pointing to
the proper URL.
Here’s an example:
url=”http://mywebsite.net/podcast
/ManVsChild.m4v”
3.
Get the length value for your video podcast’s
episode.
How you do that depends on your operating
system:
 For a PC: Right-click on the video file in
Explorer and select Properties. 

Posting on YouTube

Uploading your video to YouTube
If your video meets the previous three criteria, you
can upload it to YouTube:
1.
If you haven’t done so already, set up an
account with YouTube. (No worries — it’s free!)
Click the Sign Up link at www.youtube.com and
follow the steps under Create Your YouTube
Account.
2.
After you’ve registered, click the Upload link
located in the upper-right corner of the
YouTube home page.
3.
Enter your video’s identifying information into
YouTube’s Video Upload interface. 
Make sure you enter a title, brief description,
and meta-tags (for YouTube and other search
engines), as shown in Figure 42-1.
4.
Choose a Category appropriate for your
podcast.
• Figure 42-1: Adding in as much information as possible
makes your video easier to find.
5.
Click the Upload a Video button.
This takes you to the next step, where you find
the video on your local computer.
6.
Click Browse to find your video podcast and
click the video’s filename to highlight it. 
7.
Click the Upload Video button.
Depending on the traffic to YouTube and the
speed of your connection, your video begins the
uploading process — and is online and running
within minutes.
The specifications covered in this practice
cover the technical specifications of YouTube
only. The content of your video is a different
matter altogether. YouTube, in its Terms of
Service agreement, states “. . . you will not
submit material that is copyrighted, protected
by trade secret or otherwise subject to third-
party proprietary rights, including privacy and
publicity rights, unless you are the owner of
such rights or have permission from their
rightful owner to post the material. . . .” That
means the rights to the content you submit
must belong to you. Additionally, if your con-
tent likes to “walk on the wild side,” YouTube
also reserves to right to terminate your
account if it finds your content has “ . . .
pornography, obscene or defamatory material,
or excessive length.”
After the video is online, your content is offered up
on a designated YouTube page, with the video
embedded in the page until it’s removed from the
server (either you or YouTube may do that). There’s
even a subscription option that allows you to sub-
scribe to a particular user’s videos. Then, when a
new video is posted, you’re notified via e-mail.
Embedding your YouTube video on your blog
Many video podcasters embed their current sea-
son’s videos on their host blogs with accompanying
blogposts. YouTube makes this process easy.

Practice 42: Posting and Distributing Your Video
344
YouTube’s subscription model does appear (at the
outset) to be podcasting, but there’s a distinction:
Actual podcast content is brought to you automati-
cally and waits on your computer; with the subscrip-
tion service, YouTube simply notifies the subscriber
that new content is online, and the subscriber has to
go get it and review it online. And if a month or two
goes by and the creator of the content decides to
pull it, there are no guarantees it will still be there
when the subscriber goes looking for it.
The upside of posting to YouTube is that its heavy
traffic means lots of exposure for your video. YouTube
is the most popular site for online video content;
there’s no denying that it has evolved into the prover-
bial 800-pound gorilla from its humble beginnings. So
if you’re looking for high numbers of potential viewers
and pre-existing traffic that might find you in random
searches, YouTube is the place for your videos.
Posting on Google Video
Not to be outdone, the 800-pound gorilla of search
engines now offers Google Video (http://video.
google.com) as friendly competition for YouTube.
Google Video offers many of the same features as
YouTube, only this time the power of the Google
search engine is behind it, accessing videos on its
own server and other video streaming services like
YouTube. Featured on the home page is a range of
offerings from music videos to AOL videos to movie
trailers. Google Video also gives recommendations,
special featured clips, and even a quick cross-section
of popular videos. 
Videos appearing on Google Video differ slightly from
those on YouTube in their technical specifications:

Frame rate per second (fps) should be 12 fps or
higher.

All screen resolutions up to 640 × 480 are
acceptable.

The recommended codecs (explained in
Practices 40 and 41) are H.264, H.263, MPEG
1/2/4 or Motion JPEG.
The following steps use WordPress (www.word
press.com) as a common example of a host blog;
however, the steps should be similar with other
hosted blog platforms:
1.
On the video’s host page, look for the Embed
field (located to the upper-right of the clip).
2.
Select the code in the Embed field and copy it
to your Clipboard.
Press either Ctrl+C (Windows) or Ú+C (Mac).
3.
Go to your WordPress dashboard and choose
Users➪Your Profile. 
Confirm that the option for using the visual
editor when writing is not checked. If it is
checked, click the option to turn it off and
then click Update Profile.
4.
Choose Write➪Post and compose your entry. 
5.
When your entry is finished, press Ctrl+V
(Windows) or Ú+V (Mac) to paste the code you
copied from YouTube. 
When embedding your video, you have to
use the Code editor, not the Visual editor. For
best results when you’re embedding video,
make certain your blog defaults to a Code
editor for your posts. To go from Visual Editor
to Code, simply click the “Code” tab in the
blog’s posting interface.
6.
Save, edit, or publish the entry.
Here are your options:
 Click Save to save the draft for later.
 Click Save and Continue Editing to preview
the post or continue editing.
 Click Publish to make the post go live.
At this point, you have incorporated video with a
blogpost, which keeps your audience in the know
about what you’re doing with your video podcast.
But is this podcasting?

Embedding Your Google Video on Your Blog
345

Use one of the following formats: avi, .mov,
.wmv, .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .asf, .ra, .ram,
or .mod.
If you decide to utilize Google Video, uploading
videos to it is straightforward:
1.
Go to www.googlevideo.com, and in the
upper-right corner, click Sign In to access
Google Video uploading privileges. 
If you do not have a Google account, click Create
an Account Now and follow the steps.
2.
After you’ve registered and logged in, click the
Upload Your Videos link, which is under the
My Videos heading on the upper-right side of
the Google Video home page.
3.
Click the Browse button in the Video File field
to find your video podcast.
4.
Specify a title, brief description, and chosen
category and language, as shown in Figure 42-2.
• Figure 42-2: Google Video gets your video online in only
a matter of moments.
5.
Designate whether you want this video to be
Public or Private.
6.
After reviewing the Upload Terms of Service,
check the I Agree box.
7.
Click the Upload Video button.
As with YouTube, your upload time will
vary depending on Google’s traffic and your
connection.
The same rules concerning copyright and ownership
of the video content still apply here — but unlike
YouTube, Google Video doesn’t restrict running time.
Whether it is one minute or one hour, you can post it
on Google Video.
With Google Video, however, there’s no subscription
option; users have to check either the host blog or
Google Video for any new content. Also, finding the
code allowing you to embed the video into your
host blog is not as easy to find as it is on YouTube.
We cover that in the next section.
Embedding Your Google 
Video on Your Blog
You are now going to embed your Google video into
a blogpost. Although the steps might vary from blog
interface to blog interface, we’re going to show you
how to embed a video using WordPress as an exam-
ple. Regardless of what blog software you are using,
you will find that Google Video makes embedding
video into your blogs very easy:
1.
On the video’s host page, click the blue button
labeled Email – Blog – Post to MySpace (at the
upper-right of the clip’s window).
2.
Click the link for Embed HTML to reveal a field
with code. 
3.
Select the code in the Embed field and copy it
to your Clipboard by pressing either Ctrl+C
(Windows) or Ú+C (Mac).
4.
Go to your WordPress dashboard and choose
Users➪Your Profile. 
Confirm that the option for using the visual
editor when writing is not checked. If it is
checked, click the option to turn it off and
then click Update Profile.

• Figure 42-3: Google Video not only shows search results
from its own server but from YouTube as well. 
Google Video doesn’t notify users when new content
is online. There are a couple of advantages, though,
in allowing users to download video from Google:

You can offer an iPod-friendly version of the con-
tent to users.

Users can transfer the video from your server to
their computer or iPod for viewing on their
schedule.
Google Video still delivers video far less efficiently
than a true video podcast. It relies on users to check
for the video and doesn’t inform users that new con-
tent is online. 
Although YouTube and Google Video offer many
perks for video podcasters, the do-it-yourself pod-
casting approach has a potent advantage: automatic
delivery of content to a feed that offers the video
media to your subscription list without requiring
anybody to go looking for it. 
Bottom line: YouTube and Google Video offer homes
for video but lack the capability to use RSS to inform
or deliver new content to their subscribers. Things
stayed like that till Lulu TV went online and changed
everything. 
5.
Choose Write➪Post and compose your entry. 
6.
When your entry is ready, press Crtl+V (PC) or
Ú+V (Mac) to paste in the code copied from
Google Video. 
7.
Save, edit, or publish the entry.
Here are your options:
 Click Save to save the draft for later.
 Click Save and Continue Editing to preview
the post or continue editing.
 Click Publish to make the post go live.
Another advantage of working with Google Video is
a downloading option. Located just above the blue
Email – Blog – Post to MySpace button is a
Download button and a drop-down menu offering a
download for the following formats: 

Windows/Mac

Video iPod/Sony PSP
By selecting a format and clicking the Download but-
ton, the user gets additional instructions for down-
loading and transferring the video from the
computer to a portable device.
Only videos uploaded to Google Video offer
the download feature. When you’re surfing
through Google Video’s Web site, you may
notice (in both the top frame and the main
window) that some of the videos featured are
actually hosted on YouTube; these are marked
by a small YouTube icon. (The Google Video
content is marked by the signature “G” of
Google, as shown in Figure 42-3.) The
YouTube videos hosted on Google are stream-
ing videos only; they can’t be downloaded
through Google Video.
Google Video is definitely a step closer to podcast-
ing than is YouTube — but again, is this really
podcasting?

Posting on Lulu TV
347
Posting on Lulu TV
Lulu TV (http://lulu.tv) has upped the ante for
the YouTube and Google Video power players. At
first glance, Lulu TV offers many of the same func-
tions as its counterparts, but on closer inspection,
you’ll notice the easily recognized RSS-feed symbol
to the right of the screen with the words “video pod-
cast” right next to it.
Yes, Lulu TV is a host for video podcasts — a host
that does not charge hosting fees and can potentially
pay you for your content!
Lulu TV gives you the best of both YouTube and
Google Video but with the added bonus of that all-
important RSS feed that distributes the podcast
for you.
We bet your mind is still lingering on the “getting
paid” part. Isn’t it?
Lulu TV (see Figure 42-4) offers two accounts (both
of which are free to join) for their filmmakers — a
Standard and a Shareholder account. The Shareholder
account offers uploads up to 200MB but also makes
you part of the Lulu TV machine. Lulu TV takes 80%
of the site’s ad revenue and sets it aside in a cash
pool reserved for the shareholders. The video con-
tent that you create and upload earns revenue based
on your share of traffic through your Lulu TV URL.
The revenue might not be enough to quit your day
job, but it’s a nice little boost to your bank account,
good for a night out or adding another gadget to your
studio. Again, how much revenue you receive
depends on how much traffic visits your Lulu page.
(And no, subscriptions to the podcast don’t count.)
Here are the tech specs for Lulu TV:

File size can be up to 100MB for Standard
accounts and up to 200MB for Shareholder
accounts.

Video should be at a 4 × 3 screen ratio at 
480 × 360. (A 16 × 9 widescreen resolution at 
352 × 288 is supported but not recommended.)

Set the bit rate to 400kbs, use 20–25fps, and turn
off “interlace” options.

Audio should be at 44 mHz, 128 kbps, and com-
pressed using either mp3 or aac format.

Export video using the codec H.264.

Content should be in the format of .avi, .mov,
.wmv, and .mp4, in order for Lulu TV to convert
it to Flash video, iPod/iTunes/PSP-ready MP4,
and cell-phone-ready 3GP.
• Figure 42-4: Lulu TV brings to the table free hosting for
podcasts and some extra cash on the side! 
When your podcast episodes are ready to go, you
can click the Uploads link at the top of the home
page to begin the process. It will involve setting up a
free account — but that’s typical of many podcast-
service providers.
Uploading on Lulu TV is, again, similar to the other
hosting services listed here:
1.
At the top of the Lulu TV home page, click Log
In; then either log in if you have an account or
follow the steps under Register to set up an
account.
2.
At the top of the home page for Lulu TV, click
the Uploads link and select the Upload option.
3.
Follow the three-step process outlined on the
page that appears. 
For more details on preparing your video for
uploading, click the Conversion Assistance
Guide link.

Practice 42: Posting and Distributing Your Video
348
To join the ODT, you need to generate content that will
catch the eye of Lulu TV. After the invitation is accepted,
your responsibilities to the ODT will include these:

Creating commissioned work for Lulu TV. If time
does not allow for you to create commissioned work,
that’s fine. However, the more you create, the more
cash you earn.

Following Lulu TV’s Monthly Memes. If you’re
invited to create a Monthly Meme (a video following a
theme specified by Lulu TV), Lulu pays you $100 or
more for making a video that fits the meme.

Helping to build Lulu TV’s community of cre-
ators. Members are asked to represent Lulu TV and
recruit new talent. If you come across creative video
podcasters with a pro’s attitude and a creator’s pas-
sion, tell them about the ODT.
What makes the ODT different from the rest of the Lulu
TV community is that you are now part of the Lulu TV
crew, giving back to the company that is allowing you to
share (at no cost to you) your creative side with the world.
The ODT is your way of “paying it forward” to Lulu TV.
With your distribution options before you, the next
step is to decide which method works best for your
podcast. Will you stick exclusively with your feed,
combine your own RSS with Google Video or
YouTube to deliver your video content to the world,
or turn to Lulu TV (for all of the above)? Review
your options (as well as the Terms of Service) for
each Web site and then finalize the plan that works
best for you and your video podcast.
4.
Click the Browse button and locate your video
episode on your computer.
5.
After reviewing the Upload Terms of Service,
check the I Agree box.
6.
Click the Upload Video button.
7.
Provide a description of your video.
8.
After the video is uploaded, go to your Profile,
which you can access by clicking the My VLog
link at the top of the Lulu TV home page.
9.
Under the My Links section of your profile, you
will find feeds for My Video Podcast that are
iTunes and straight RSS. Register these feeds at
FeedBurner (www.feedburner.com) and other
external directories.
After you upload a new video to your account, Lulu
TV automatically updates the feed.
Lulu TV may appear to be a haven only for
video podcasters, but audio podcasters are
also starting to feel the love because Lulu TV
now offers these services for audio and music
podcasters. So if you are looking to make a lit-
tle cash at this podcasting thing, take a look at
what Lulu TV is offering to the audio creators
and musicians of the podosphere.
A not-so-secret society of podcasters
Lulu TV is putting out a call to creative people everywhere —
tired of the restrictions of DRM (digital rights management),
distribution, and the status quo of entertainment — to bring
their content to them. The Lulu folks want you to join their
order — and they’re so intent to bring you in, they’re willing
to pay you for it!
The Order of the Digital Trebuchet (ODT) is Lulu TV’s creative
community; its members are invited to join the new-media
revolution on account of their professionalism, high produc-
tion values, and creativity. Lulu TV is still working out the
details of membership, but ODT members get a subscription
to a private mailing list, Lulu TV swag, and (of course) money
for commissioned work that’s featured on the home page.

Part VII
Podcasting as a
Business

Deriving Revenue
from Your Podcast
T
ell someone that you’re a podcaster, and you’ll likely get two ques-
tions right away: “What the heck is a podcast?” and “Are you making
any money from this?” Try it out on five acquaintances who don’t
already know about your podcast (or your plans for podcasting). We’ll bet
you that one or both of those questions come up at least three out of five
times. Been there, done that.
The second question is a valid one: Exactly how can you make money
from your podcast? The title of this book is Expert Podcasting Practices
For Dummies, for crying out loud. Surely we’d be remiss if we didn’t share
with you the secrets of getting rich quick (uh-huh . . . well, okay, possibly
deriving at least some income from this activity). At this point, you’re
investing (or are about to invest) a lot of time, energy and/or money into
building your program — and surely there must be some ways to cover
those costs and put a few bucks in your pocket, right?
The answer: Maybe. Without a doubt, several podcasters who consider
themselves full-time podcasters actually do make plenty of money in their
podcasting careers. An even larger number have kept their day jobs but
have found ways to supplement their main income via podcasting. But
before we go too far down the road to the riches some of you readers are
desperately seeking, may we offer a dose of reality? The vast majority of
podcasts — easily over 90 percent by sheer volume — never see a penny
in revenue for their trouble. And for most of them, that is totally and
completely okay.
In this practice, we’ll briefly cover some of the approaches you might
consider that could bring in revenue to your podcast. If you’re part of the
vast majority who is less interested in making income right now and
more interested in making your podcast look and sound the best, feel
free to skip this practice altogether or just skim it. Some of the best
expert podcasts we know are income-free, and we’re perfectly happy
with them as-is. So with that disclaimer, let’s get started!

audience has grown numb to getting as much as
20 minutes of commercial messaging in a single 
60-minute program, podcast listeners have a much
different experience — and, now, expectation.
You can usually get away with a simple pre-
roll or post-roll (these terms are defined in
Practice 47) ad in your episode, but your audi-
ence will likely not put up with three or four
commercials in a 20-minute episode.
Podcasters who have decided to try running ads on
their podcasts really have only two options when it
comes to finding advertisers willing to spend money
on their podcast:

Join an advertising network and let it act as
your salesperson. This is the simplest option.
Many networks have active salespeople looking
for large advertisers with significant sums of
cash — these, for example:
 Kiptronic (http://kiptronic.com)
 PodShow (http://podshow.com)
 BluBrry (http://blubrry.com)
 PodTrac (http://podtrac.com)
When they find advertisers, they then 
 Offer a price list to the companies or organi-
zations to run their ads across one or many of
the podcasts represented on the network.
 Negotiate pricing, taking a significant chunk
for themselves, and then (in most cases)
allowing individual podcasters a chance to
participate in the program.
Checks are cut from the network to the pod-
caster depending on how many ads were run in
the various episodes during the campaign
period, rinse and repeat. No fuss, no muss.

Act as your own sales force. Pick up the phone
and call companies whose products would be 
a good match with your listening audience.
Podcasts such as Trader Interviews (www.
traderinterviews.com) and Grape Radio
Making Money “from”
Your Podcast
There are quite a few ways of making money with —
also called monetizing — your podcast. Individuals
and companies found out long ago how to make
money with audio and video content, so all of those
time-tested models still have applications in the
podcasting world. Yes, we can hear the new-media
purists crying heresy and sacrilege, pontificating
about how podcasting shouldn’t follow the old
ways. (Didn’t we warn you people off in the intro-
duction? This isn’t the practice you’re looking for; it’s
just a little practical entrepreneurial schmoozing.)
Now, where were we? Oh yes, making money.
Advertising
You’ve worked hard on your show to improve the
quality and content, and you’ve amassed a sizeable
audience. Congratulations. You’re doing something
very similar — though likely on a smaller scale — to
what the various TV and radio networks, producers,
and stations have done: You’re focusing the attention
on a relatively large number of people who will share
in an audio or video experience. There are advertis-
ers out there who will pay you for the privilege of
putting their message in front of your audience.
Paid advertisements often take the form of a pre-
recorded clip, ranging in size from 15 to 60 seconds
on average. These clips are then inserted into the
podcast, sometimes at the front, sometimes at the
end, and sometimes in the middle, before the pod-
cast is released to the listener or viewer. As you can
see, this arrangement isn’t much different from what
goes on when you’re dialed into a commercial radio
or TV program. The true content of the program is
broken up by one or more (usually many more)
commercial messages.
We cover advertising plans in detail in Practice 47,
but it’s probably a good idea to hand out some
advice early on for those of you who are considering
adding ads to your podcast. While the radio and TV

Making Money “from” Your Podcast
353
(http://graperadio.com) have found lucra-
tive ad deals by adopting this strategy. 
This option requires a significant amount of
work, a very good understanding of the size and
makeup of your audience, and a specific set of
skills in a variety of areas — including sales and
marketing, tracking and reporting, and accounts
receivable. We’re not trying to push podcasters
away from this option — far from it. In fact, pod-
casters who can go it alone will more than likely
make a larger paycheck, if only because they
cut out the commission and fees charged by 
the networks.
Both approaches are equally viable; each podcaster
has to determine which works best for his or her
situation.
Prior to joining any network or engaging any
sales force, read the contracts carefully. That’s
solid business advice and probably doesn’t
even need to be said. However, we under-
stand that most podcasters got into this activ-
ity as a hobby and because it was fun. When
money is involved, you have to put the fun on
the back burner and become a fierce enough
businessperson to protect your interests. That
means getting rather ruthless in your exami-
nation of any legal agreements. In fact, it’s
worth spending the cash and getting an expe-
rienced intellectual-property attorney’s opin-
ion. Yes, we’re quite serious.
Direct sales
Some podcasts are created with the express purpose
of selling a product. The content is, for all points and
purposes, one big sales pitch. For those of you pooh-
poohing the thought of anyone subscribing to and lis-
tening to a weekly sales pitch, might we direct your
attention to The Home Shopping Network? Lots of
money is made in the direct-sales business, with HSN,
QVC, Sunday morning infomercials, and pay-for-play
talk radio raking in huge piles of cash.
But let’s be realistic: The success of these networks
and programs is largely predicated on reaching — or
on the potential of reaching — a massive audience.
Most podcasts reach a niche market — usually a
very small one in comparison to what passes for a
“mass” audience. But while that might not be a true
apples-to-apples comparison, there is no question
that people will listen to or watch direct sales pro-
gramming and purchase the items offered — enough
people to keep the process going.
Companies already involved in direct-to-consumer
sales will find the most benefit from this approach.
Of course, if you just sell one type of widget, you’re
probably going to struggle to come up with com-
pelling content for more than a couple of episodes.
But if you have a full product line (say, in cosmetics
or automotive tires), your marketing department
probably is loaded down with compelling case stud-
ies, product specification sheets, and consumer 
surveys — all of which can help you sketch out the
content for a dozen shows or more. Can you say,
“Season One”?
So what do you say about these products to get peo-
ple to buy? Why are you asking us? The pros don’t
have any hidden secrets — they put it all in their
program! Tell your boss to give you tomorrow off so
you can do some research. Sit on the couch, open
the TV guide, and watch as many infomercials as
you can for inspiration. Take those ideas back, figure
out how you’re going to get it done, and start mak-
ing a plan.
You should realize that the part of the general public
already listening to podcasts probably won’t get
overly excited about your new “podcast commercial”
programming. That’s okay — they aren’t the ones
you’re appealing to. Rather, you’re going after your
prospective and repeat customers. Here are a few
ways you can do that: 

Print the URL of your podcast on your promo-
tional material. 

Promote the heck out of the show on your Web
site. 

Make sure you’ve made it extremely easy for
your customers to listen to or watch.

It costs nothing to join, and you get to choose which
companies you act as an affiliate for. This book isn’t
the place for us to go into the nuances of making a
fortune with affiliate marketing (though some really
smart people are doing that all the time). As a pod-
caster, you can run affiliate links on your Web site,
causing you to get paid when someone clicks and
buys. Other podcasters have figured out that they
can drive their listeners to a specific URL that links
through the affiliate system — again allowing them
to get paid if someone buys after using that link. 
The process is a bit complicated, and you have to be
able to redirect traffic from your Web site or domain
name. 
Before you try this, check with your Web
server or ISP to find out whether your site can
handle redirects.
So far we’ve discussed ways of selling inside your
show, but what if you’ve sold your show altogether?
If your name is (say) Tony Robbins and you already
have thousands of people dishing out hard cash to
get your latest series of instructional content on CD,
you should seriously consider using podcasting to
help distribute your information — and bring in rev-
enue. But if your name is Gern Blanstien and you
think that people should pay to hear you play a few
tunes and talk about why you left the gym early last
night, you’re probably going to find few folks willing
to play along.
Candidly, few people have been able to crack the nut
when it comes to getting paid for content in podcast
form. Podcasting is very much a free medium by
and large — so know that you’re swimming against
the stream if you decide to go this route. You should
make sure that your content is worth the cash you’d
be asking, and move forward with eyes wide open.
To underscore this point, we remind you that
Audible, a company that has sold audio content
successfully for years, recently abandoned its paid-
podcast division WorldCast after 18 months. It turns
out that there just wasn’t that much interest in 
self-produced paid podcasting content.
Affiliates
Affiliate marketing can be a great idea for a pod-
caster who wants to run advertising but doesn’t
really want to hire a sales force or let a network do
the selling for the show. Start by signing up with one
of the following clearinghouses for affiliate relation-
ships (shown in Figure 43-1):

Commission Junction (http://cj.com)

Making Money “Because of” Your Podcast

Interested parties should take a look at PrivaCast, a
secure method of selling podcast content. It was cre-
ated by Michael Geoghegan, a pioneer of podcasting
since 2004.
Podiobooks.com had success with both affilia-
tion and listener donations early on.
Making Money “Because of”
Your Podcast
As we said earlier, the podosphere is largely filled
with free content produced by people who don’t
have primary goals of making money from their
podcast. Radio is commercial. TV is commercial.
Podcasting is still (and, with luck, always will be)
dominated by the hobbyists who are more inter-
ested in having fun and exploring their art than
collecting a paycheck. But a few of those intrepid
“non-trepreneurs” have discovered something inter-
esting: All those hours months and years spent
perfecting their craft are paying off in profitable
opportunities that they would not have had if not
for their podcast. 
The following sections give you examples of three
podcasters (Scott Sigler, Amanda Congdon, and
Rob Walch) who have made significantly more
money because of, rather than directly from, their
podcasts.
Promoting yourself
In our first book, Podcasting For Dummies, we men-
tioned Scott Sigler. At the time, he was a rookie to
podcasting, using the method to release an audio
version of his novel EarthCore. Since that time, Scott
has gone on to release three more books in audio-
podcast form — and has managed to infect more
than 50,000 self-proclaimed junkies with his ances-
tral style of storytelling. 
But these people do more than just listen to what
Scott has to say — many of them follow his very
specific instructions — to a clear advantage. On
April 1, 2007, the print version of Scott’s second
book, Ancestor, was made available for purchase on
Amazon.com. Prior to that date, Scott reached out
to his fan base and the podosphere, asking people
to purchase copies of Ancestor from Amazon at
exactly 9:00 a.m. PST on April 1. They did — to the
tune of around 6,000 purchases made — driving
Ancestor to the No. 4 overall top-selling book for the
day. In an interesting halo effect, EarthCore (previ-
ously published and still available on Amazon.com)
had similar success.
It was a huge coup for Scott — and a huge win for
the power of podcasting, with big media taking
notice. Not long after, Scott was offered a three book
deal from Crown Publishing, a division of Random
House. He was able to prove his ability to draw an
audience, something publishers are constantly on
the lookout for.
Showcasing your skills
Amanda Congdon hosts ABC’s (yes, as in the
American Broadcasting Company) weekly video
podcast called Starring Amanda Congdon. Prior 
to that, Amanda was one of the first video pod-
casters, hosting a show called Rocketboom back 
in October 2004. According to BusinessWeek,
Rocketboom was the most popular podcast by
September 2005, with over 50,000 daily downloads.
Someone took notice. Amanda left the show in 
June 2006 — with her audience approaching 
the half-million mark — to “pursue interests in
Hollywood,” according to Rocketboom’s co-founder
Aaron Barron. Since that time, she has been inter-
viewed on CNN, MSNBC, and a host of other media
outlets. Her current show on ABC has been success-
ful, and she is working on developing a comedy
show with HBO.

Rob spent a year in the consulting side, working
with corporations and organizations that were try-
ing to understand how they could use this new
medium to get their message across. He parlayed
his experience back into a full-time position, work-
ing at a public-relations firm that added Rob to the
staff when more and more of its clients were curious
about the medium. And just days ago (as of this
writing), Rob accepted a job as Vice President of
Podcaster Relations with Wizzard Media, the largest
podcast hosting company.
And here’s the good news: Rob and his compatriots
who tried to get podcast consulting going back in the
day probably were jumping the gun just a bit. Back
then, independent podcasters made up the lion’s
share of all available content. Today, the scene is
changing — more and more media properties and
commercial entities are entering the space. For the
last few months, it’s been hard to find an independent
podcaster represented in the iTunes Top 20 Podcast
list. That’s not likely to change anytime soon.
Think you’ve got what it takes to be a podcasting
consultant? Well . . . you probably do. So update
your résumé. Get a profile on LinkedIn (http://
linkedin.com). And start checking Craig’s List
and other job boards. Those of you who have been
podcasting for a while are about to be in a pretty
position.
Of course, Amanda’s story is far from typical. But it
does demonstrate the power of podcasting. There is
little question that Amanda’s personal approach to
podcasting played a pivotal role in developing the
huge following of Rocketboom. As the host of the
show, she was able to demonstrate her ability not
only to grow an audience, but also to show how she
handled herself in front of the camera. That’s impor-
tant to traditional media.
You don’t have to be a compelling video pres-
ence to showcase — or refine — your skills.
Maybe you’re a great writer, have excellent
editing skills, or are one heck of a camera
operator. Use your podcast to let the world
know. And don’t be afraid to sing your own
praises.
Becoming a consultant
Long ago in podcasting, all the way back in early
2006, it was somewhat fashionable to quit your day
job and go make a living from podcasting. Rather
than charging for the podcast or getting massive ad
deals, many podcasters serious about this career
path followed an obvious route — they went into
the consulting business.
Take Rob Walch, for example. Rob was and is the
host of podCast411, the definitive show that covers
the movers and shakers of podcasting. Think of him
as the Larry King of podcasting and you won’t be
too far off.

Corporate
Podcasting
B
ringing podcasting into the workplace can be a very tough sell. The
majority of podcasters and podcasts available are being given away
for nothing and produced independently from the basement of
someone’s home.
But enough about the Podcasting For Dummies podcast. Seriously . . . 
If you look on iTunes, you will find big names entering the podosphere:
The Washington Post, Apple, and BusinessWeek are voicing their opinions
and overviews of the business world, reaching out to a truly global audi-
ence on improving business, financial tips, or reports concerning the
status of the national or global economy. Both big and small businesses
have a place in podcasting. And your company can carve out a niche of
its own, provided you clearly communicate the aim and expectations
of the podcast to the powers that be.
Great Expectations for Your 
Company’s Podcast
When you approach your boss or higher-ups with the idea of hosting a
podcast, you should put together a slick PowerPoint or Keynote presen-
tation that explains exactly what you’re doing. Chances are, the higher-
ups don’t even know how to launch iTunes on their own laptops, so
you’ll want to make certain you answer these questions:

What a podcast is

What the company will gain from having a podcast

How much it will cost
It is up to you to clearly communicate in your presentation exactly what
a podcast is. After you’ve explained the concept of podcasting, it’s a 
natural progression to head into what the company will gain from hosting
a podcast and how much it will cost to create one. Although it’s tempting

Without focused intent, the podcast is adrift in
the podosphere. Give it direction and purpose
in your initial pitch — and keep that focus to
carry your podcast through its first and follow-
ing seasons.
Choosing the right equipment 
for your company’s budget
Another good strategy for setting expectations is to
have an inexpensive rig already priced out and
ready to present to management. We’ve thrown out
several recording options and ideas in this book
that may work for you, but the easiest setup is
perhaps the best one when you’re beginning a
corporate podcast.
The M-Audio Solution (starting at under $250 USD)
Using M-Audio’s USB MobilePre as your audio inter-
face (see Figure 44-1), you can easily build a starter
studio for less than $250 USD. Along with this pre-
amp, you can also purchase some basic goodies,
such as the following:

MXL990 condenser microphone

Desktop microphone stand

Male-to-female XLR cable
For software, opt for a free download of Audacity
(http://audacity.sourceforge.net).
• Figure 44-1: M-Audio’s USB MobilePre is a cost-effective
beginning for a clean, professional-sounding
podcast.
to ask for high-end podcast gear, don’t; it may be
more beneficial for you to work economically (but
not too economically) at first and then upgrade later.
You’ll want to prove the podcast’s worth before
asking for the audio toys that carry the steep
price tags.
Making your case to management
The hardest question for you to answer is: “What
will the company gain from the podcast?” How 
does the company benefit from giving away quality
content for free? What is the reward or advantage
for all the time, effort, and investment you’re asking
the company to put into this podcast?
You will want to make perfectly clear to the inter-
ested parties — the managers, the executives, and
those who make the final decisions concerning pro-
motional vehicles such as podcasting — that this is
not the new get-rich-quick vehicle. Businesses look-
ing to podcasting as a revenue generator will be
somewhat disappointed in the end result. Even with
corporations such as ESPN and Disney throwing
their talent and resources into it, and iTunes launch-
ing iTunesU (featuring college courses from presti-
gious universities and colleges from coast to coast),
podcasting is still new media. The average person-
on-the-street is more familiar with how a DVR works
than with the simple, one-step process of subscrib-
ing to a podcast.
Therefore, before you sit down to record those first
five episodes of the company podcast, be sure
you’ve made clear the intent behind the podcast.
Why do you want to launch this podcast? Here are a
few examples of why some businesses choose to
launch a podcast:

Reach out to a larger audience

Training for staff

Generate public awareness of a specific issue
that the company is related to or has a vested
interest in

This starter package for your podcast is a minimal
investment that will yield better-quality audio than
some out-of-the-box solutions. Setup is simply a mat-
ter of plugging the USB-powered preamp into your
computer or laptop and then plugging the micro-
phone into the MobilePre. Audacity is a free down-
load that gives you a good basic audio-editing
capability with little investment. You can then
record a few episodes and, after the podcast begins
to take shape, look into upgrading the software
(first) and (eventually) the hardware.
The Alesis Solution (starting at under $400 USD)
With the Alesis Multimix-8 FireWire mixer (shown in
Figure 44-2) as your audio interface, you still retain
the ease of setup (you just plug the mixer into an
electric outlet and into a FireWire/IEEE-1394, and
then plug the microphone into an available chan-
nel), but now you have more potential for expand-
ability. At the time of this writing, both Alesis
(www.alesis.com) and BSW (www.bswusa.com)
offer a podcast package priced at $300 USD that
includes these essentials: 

AKG Perception-100 condenser microphone

Desktop microphone stand

Male-to-female XLR cable 

Pyro 5 (Windows) or iLife, featuring GarageBand
3 (Macintosh) 
This proposed package gives you the power of
FireWire and accommodates additional equipment,
such as more microphones, external devices such as
compressors or noise gates, and extra headphones
for co-hosts and guests. While still remaining under
the budget of $400 USD, you can implement some
more capable software such as Pyro or GarageBand.
The investment is a step up from the M-Audio solu-
tion but still not too intimidating to start with.
• Figure 44-2: For under $400 USD, the Alesis Multimix-8
offers ease of setup with terrific sound and
expandability.
This Alesis deal is just one of many package
deals offered by vendors. Deals come and go,
of course, so there is no way to guarantee that
this Alesis package deal will be available when
you get this book. Don’t fret, however;
Zzounds (www.zzounds.com), BSW
(www.bswusa.com), and other online ven-
dors offer great deals similar to the one
described here. Ask other podcasters to 
point out which online vendors and brick-and-
mortar stores have the best deals. 
The H4 Zoom Solution (starting at under $500 USD)
The Samson H4 Zoom, shown in Figure 44-3, offers
endless options as a starter podcast package — the
device can be used as a portable recorder, an audio
interface, and a four-channel mixer. The device also
offers two additional XLR line inputs, a built-in com-
pressor and limiter, and microphone emulators that
can reproduce the audio results from several audio-
industry favorites (including the Shure SM57). Add to
all this the convenience of recording your audio onto
a simple SD card and importing your recording ses-
sions into your computer via clicking and dragging.

From these humble beginnings, you can begin to
build your podcasting dream studio. You don’t need
to break the bank (yours or your company’s) on
your first outing as a podcaster — but once you
prove your worth to the company’s mission and
time, upgrades are easy to come by.
Coloring within Corporate Lines
Corporate America, no matter how big or small the
business is, tends to be gun-shy concerning new
media. As mentioned earlier, you’ll encounter a fear
factor: nervous voices asking what podcasting is,
how it works, what the price tag is, and what hap-
pens if it doesn’t pan out.
And when it comes to the Internet, companies ask
even more questions:

Who will be receiving and reviewing this new
media production, and are there security issues?

Will this new medium reach our target audience?

How do we get the word out to our target audi-
ence about this new medium?

How will this new medium reflect back on the
company?
As far as the art of podcasting goes, corporate pod-
casting may seem like a somewhat restrictive arena,
with all these questions and considerations coming
along for the ride. Compared to shows like GeekLabel
Radio (which is a corporate podcast), The GeoLogic
Podcast, and TikiBar TV, podcasting on a corporate
level can be subject to some very rigid rules about
what you can and can’t do. Your guidelines for the
audio or video you want to produce are already
defined for you in your company’s policies and pro-
cedures. Talking with your managers, too, is a good
resource when you’re defining the boundaries.
Sometimes, however, it’s just a matter of common
sense.
• Figure 44-3: Enjoy the best of both worlds — portable
and studio recording — with an investment
in the Samson H4 Zoom.
All this portability and versatility comes at you for
$300 USD, but this is merely the foundation for this
recording option. If you want to take advantage of its
full potential, you can also invest in some of these
add-ons: 

Two MXL990 condenser microphones (@$50 USD
each)

Two desktop microphone stands (@$9 USD each)

Two 3-foot male-to-female XLR cables (@$6 USD
each)

Pyro 5 (Windows) or iLife, featuring GarageBand
3 (Macintosh) 
For less than the $500 USD budget, you have just
built a studio that not only yields a clean sound but
is also portable — allowing you to do remote pod-
casts if necessary.

Corporate image
When Tee was producing the first season of
Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast, he
was breaking new ground. Wiley was doing something
it had never done before: a podcast. Additionally, the
podcast was hosted by a Wiley author — technically,
part of the Wiley team but not armed with the
company policies or the like.
While planning the launch of this podcast, Tee
thought, “If I were a corporation, what would I be
concerned about?” Here were his conclusions:

Keep the podcast short. Stick to the facts and
try to stay under 15 minutes.

The For Dummies series is family-friendly. (Even
the book Dr. Ruth wrote.) Keep the podcast
along these same lines.

Be respectful of the Wiley support crew, other
For Dummies authors, or other Wiley imprints.
You are all — what? — part of a team. 
Remember that the podcast you’re producing isn’t
your podcast, but the company’s podcast. You are
the podcast’s host, but the company will have the
final say.
Corporate policy
The podcast you create for your company should
further the mission statement featured in orienta-
tion manuals and company Web sites. If you check
these statements, you will notice that airing out
dirty laundry is notably absent. This means that the
podcast is not your platform to question or rebuke
the policies and practices of the company. Here the
concern gets back (as just mentioned) to the corpo-
rate image: Officially or unofficially, your podcast is
now the voice of the corporation in the podosphere. 
And yes, that’s one reason why getting approval for
a podcast may be a tough sell to the folks in charge.
Corporate policies will apply to a podcast in much
the same way as they would apply to a booth at an
expo, a promotional event, or some other appear-
ance where the company is represented. The more
you adhere to those policies, the easier it will be to
define the parameters of your podcast. Sure, this
may seem like common sense, but it may surprise
you how often this is overlooked. 
As also mentioned earlier, it never hurts to ask
whether a certain topic is off-limits to discuss on the
podcast (And yes, please refer to the “If you have
to ask . . . ” advice just given.), but the podcast is
not the place to push the boundaries. Remember
that the podcast is now giving a voice to the com-
pany, and you’ll want to respect that, especially if
it’s on the company’s dime.
The professional attitude
There is something to be said for being good sports
in the professional sector. A podcast may appear to
be a great place to slam the competition, but the
podosphere is the last place you would want to do
that. Word travels fast (at the speed of sound if you
think about it), and when people hear you dishing
on your business rivals, opinions and commentaries
begin to take shape. When that happens, you may
want to prepare for the backlash.
Sure, there’s nothing unhealthy about healthy com-
petition, but while you want to be part of the team
among your own corporation, you should also
remember that what you say and do reflects on your
company. Do you really want to brag on how much
better your product or service is over another, or
blatantly thumb your metaphorical nose at the com-
petition? How will a smear campaign like that reflect
back on you and your company? 
As with politics, smear tactics are tempting
but do very little to improve one’s image in
the public. Keep this in mind when you are
putting together your podcasts.
Also take a listen to how your podcast sounds. Does
the podcast sound like you’re recording inside a
broom closet? Have you planned out your podcast’s
format? Will you have guest segments, special

You will already have a grasp of most of this infor-
mation when you record your first five episodes. As
far as figuring out the amount of bandwidth needed
for your podcast, refer to the handy sidebar
“Bandwidth demystified,” which provides a compact
formula for figuring out bandwidth usage based on
file size and subscribers. 
Bandwidth demystified
Bandwidth refers to the online space needed to handle the
amount of stuff you push out of your Web site every
month. The bigger the files, the more bandwidth con-
sumed. Compounding the problem, the more requests for
the files, the more bandwidth consumed. This makes suc-
cess in podcasting a double-edged sword.
Pretend that you produce a weekly show, and each
episode requires 10MB of bandwidth. You publish the
show on Monday, and your 100 subscribers receive your
show that evening. You’ve just consumed 1000MB of
bandwidth (100 × 10MB) for that week. In the next week,
more people have found out about you, and now there are
200 subscribers. Next Monday, your bandwidth increases
to 2000MB, which gets added to your previous week’s
total to bring you up to 3000MB.
But those extra 100 subscribers? They weren’t satisfied
with just the last show. They also download the previous
week’s show, tacking on an extra 1GB of bandwidth. Now
you’re at 4GB for the month.
Next week, your numbers spike again. Now you have 500
subscribers. Everyone gets the first file (which costs you 5
GB), and 300 of them are getting the previous two weeks’
files (300 × 2 × 10 MB), which rings you up for and extra
6GB. You’re now at (4 + 5 + 6) 15GB for the month. See
how things stack up?
It’s difficult to estimate how much bandwidth you’ll need
for your podcast because it’s hard to guess how many peo-
ple might be interested in your show. As a general rule, the
longer your podcast episodes, the more bandwidth you
need. If you plan on a five-minute biweekly podcast, you
have less to worry about than someone contemplating a
thrice-weekly hour-long show. The latter podcaster will be
quite concerned with how to manage bandwidth because
it will be an issue with even a small subscriber base.
features, or simply a presentation of the content
with a simple sign-on and sign-off? An eye for detail
will allow you to shape the podcast into a top-notch
production and establish it as an essential part of
your company’s Web site and overall image.
Working with IT
When I refer to “IT,” I’m not referring to Tim Curry as
the clown from Hell. I’m referring to Information
Technologies. Those frighteningly intelligent people
in that department who are looking at you (the pod-
caster) as if you’re the “stranger in town” . . .
. . . and you want to upload something on the com-
pany’s Web server? Hmmm?
The IT department is not necessarily out to make
your job — or your podcast — more difficult. These
folks are simply trying to prevent any security issues
that could arise if someone other than them uploads
anything to the server. The best thing you can do is
arrange a meeting with a member of the IT staff and
explain in person (as in not via e-mail or over the
phone, but a real-life talk) what you’re planning to do.
From there, you can get feedback about any potential
problems in making this podcast happen. 
To prepare for this face-to-face, you will need a
crash course in IT-speak.
When you do sit down and speak with the IT repre-
sentative about your podcast, you will want to have
some essential data ready:

The average file size and running time of your
podcast

An estimate of how much bandwidth an average
episode will use when transferring to X listeners 

What kind of Web presence you’ll be using (for
example, will you be using a new blog, the com-
pany’s blog, or a static Web page with XML that
you update yourself?)

What resources (if any) will be needed from the
IT department 

Working with Marketing and PR
363
Resource demands on the IT department will be
based on how confident you feel about your abilities
in updating the XML file, or how confident your IT
crew feels about working third-party plug-ins like
PodPress into their company’s blog — or (say)
allowing FeedBurner to amend the company’s RSS
feed to allow enclosures. 
The more self-sufficient you can be with your
podcast, the happier IT will be.
To prepare for this discussion, you will also want to
ask the right questions:

What will I need to make the IT Department relax
about uploading mp3 files onto the company’s
Web server?

What cap, if any, is there on bandwidth usage? 

Would the IT Department prefer to handle the
RSS feed, or would they prefer that I handle feed
issues? 

How can the IT department and I work together
to make the podcast run efficiently? 
IT standards and practices vary from corporation to
corporation. The more informed you are about how
your IT department conducts business, the happier
you, they, and your podcast will be.
And remember: As with many companies and corpo-
rations, the IT department is stretched thin; quite
often, they have conversations that amount to sud-
den marching orders (one side just “wants it to
work” with no planning or preparation). The more
questions you have already answered for the IT
Department along with your planning and research
on the technical aspect of your podcast will win you
some valuable respect points.
Working with Marketing and PR
Making a podcast on your own can be a very lonely
gig. But that’s not often the case when you’re making
a podcast for your corporation. So far you have
involved the higher-ups in the company and you
have just finished talking to the folks in IT. Now you
turn your attention to the Marketing and Public
Relations people. 
Podcasting is a natural in this area: It’s a new mar-
keting, promotion, and public relations tool, seem-
ingly built to handle all three simultaneously. That’s
why it’s a good idea to get these people involved in
what you intend to do with the company podcast.
Marketing and PR people will help you in the best
way possible: They will help you promote your
podcast.
It’s crucial that Marketing and Public Relations stay
in touch with your plans for the podcast. Milestones
such as the opening episode, the season’s ending
episode, interviews, and the 50th show are all news-
worthy events. The Marketing and PR staff will cover
these periods of your podcast for internal publica-
tions, trade magazines, local or national news serv-
ices, or all of the above. If you keep them up to speed
on what your podcast is doing, they may find venues
to spread the word about your production.
The Marketing and Public Relations staff of your
company can also assist in the planning of your 
podcast by suggesting or even making arrangements
for guests to appear. Bringing in new voices and 
perspectives will keep the content fresh and lively,
and open up your company’s podcast to a wealth 
of new listeners.
When you bring guests on the show for inter-
views, be sure to center the discussion around
them. You are, in a manner of speaking, giving
them the floor and the spotlight. Keep your
show within the parameters of your company’s
policies but make certain to keep the focus on
your guests. For more on interviews and inter-
view tips, look at Practice 38 in this book.

Practice 44: Corporate Podcasting

Knowing Your Audience
When you’ve touched base with everyone in the
corporation who needs to bestow their approval on
this podcast, there’s only one thing left to do . . . and
recording Episode #0 isn’t it. You have a final ques-
tion to ask: “Who is the audience?” 
After all, the podcast that you create for stockhold-
ers may be very different from the podcast you
would create for the general public.
Once again, you return to the pre-planning for your
corporate podcast. You need to find out who your
audience is — and from there, begin to develop the
podcast to give that audience what it needs. And
whether they know it or not, they just might need
your podcast.
Stockholders and executives
For these podcasts, you stick with the facts, figures,
and bottom lines. There’s very little, if any, wiggle
room for creativity, but you’re hardly sentenced to a
dry podcast. You can exercise a touch of profes-
sional creativity with an intro and outro that features
a theme. A title — even one as straightforward as
“Welcome to the Shareholders Podcast for Widget,
Inc.” — is a detail that your listeners will appreciate.
For the outro, make certain you include the com-
pany’s Web site, contact information, and even
feedback specifically for the podcast itself. If the
shareholders and board of executives really enjoy
what they hear and want to build on it, they’ll
assuredly let you know.
Enhanced podcasts (described in Practice 24) are
terrific podcasts for stock reports and other busi-
ness issues because you can feature relevant
images, charts, and links to what your audio is 
referring to. Your enhanced podcast becomes an
interactive stockholders meeting in your iPod.
The podcast will self-destruct 
in five seconds . . . 
For a museum dedicated to the art of espionage and intelli-
gence gathering, the International Spy Museum (www.spy
museum.org) has been attracting a lot of attention. First
there was the black-tie affair that launched the Spy Museum
in 2002. Then came the special exhibit on terrorism, The
Enemy Within, now on tour; and the latest innovation is
Operation SpyTM, an intense, immersive exhibit that enables
visitors to take on the mission of a spy. 
Now there is SpyCastTM, the official podcast of the
International Spy Museum.
The museum is a for-profit endeavor owned by The
Malrite Company, based in Cleveland, Ohio. Known for
developing innovative museums and educational projects,
The Malrite Company approved SpyCast — and for Peter
Earnest, the museum’s Founding Executive Director and
host of SpyCast, it has been a success. “SpyCast is an exten-
sion of our mission to educate . . . another way for people,
wherever they are, to meet people they would not nor-
mally meet and to hear what I hope is an intelligent con-
versation about intelligence and current affairs.”
The podcast, Peter notes, is also a fantastic promotional
vehicle for the museum. “More people are now aware of
The Spy Museum and its role, which may capture their
interest in wanting to visit or know more about it. [The
podcast] helps extend the brand.” 

Knowing Your Audience

Company employees
This is a podcast for the co-workers, for the rest of
the worker bees in the great corporate hive hosting
the podcast. Unlike the podcast for the executives,
you have (within company policies) a bit of creative
latitude. Your podcast can cover a wide range of top-
ics from training (a terrific application for enhanced
podcasting), to welcoming new employees, bidding
farewell to co-workers who are moving on to other
opportunities, or offering an audio version of the
company newsletter, broken up into segments, such
as current headlines, upcoming events, and depart-
ment heads’ reports.
Podcasting can also bring special events such as a
regional or national convention to employees who
are unable to attend. Keynote speakers can have a
seat with the podcast’s host for an interview con-
cerning the convention or expo, or convention
attendees can sit behind the microphone for a man-
on-the-street-style interview. Virtual conventions
provide terrific content for podcasts, and with the
portable options recommended in this practice,
they’re really easy to engineer.
The general public
You still answer to company policies when you’re
recording and editing your podcast; but depending
on your target audience, you can exercise your cre-
ativity as much as you like. 
In effect, you walk the line between an official pod-
cast that represents the company and a promotional
vehicle for the products, services, or merchandise
your company produces. The creativity comes in
when you’re figuring out how to make your podcast
an entertaining, informative, and professional
production.
Over at Right Stuf (www.rightstuf.com), the busi-
ness is anime and manga — an online warehouse of
Japanese animation, posters, production cells, and
more. Right Stuf also hosts Anime Today, a podcast
hosted and produced by various members of the
online anime vendor (see Figure 44-4). The show is
broken up into various segments that go into much
more than what’s on sale at Right Stuf. Anime Today
includes interviews with animators, magazine edi-
tors, and voiceover talent, lessons in Japanese, and
a glimpse of what’s happening at RightStuf.com —
both in its releases and behind the scenes. The for-
mat of the show considers what the audience wants,
what would pique their interest, and (more impor-
tant) what would hold their attention. Figure 44-4
gives you a look at what it’s got going. 
• Figure 44-4: The Right Stuf hosts Anime Today, a podcast
sponsored and produced by RightStuf.com.
When your audience is the general public, the cor-
porate podcast can do more than just discuss
what’s happening at the company. There is more
artistic latitude granted to the podcaster, provided
the podcast remains within those oft-mentioned
company policies. Allow yourself opportunities to
explore, but keep the podcast’s purpose in mind.
Consider what an audience would like to hear from a
company, and then allow yourself a little bit of fun in
reaching out to your clientele, pulling back the cur-
tain, and showing them how everything happens.

T
he White House. The ACLU. The Pentagon. The Peace Corps. At
first glance, you wouldn’t think there was a common thread among
these four, but there is: podcasting. With the success of the One
America podcast, which launched in 2004, politicians, lobbyists, not-for-
profit organizations, and government entities are discovering the power
in podcasting. There is a real potential in reaching out to the public
through podcasting, but also a hint of apprehension on account of the
distribution method and how much access and information is granted to
the general public.
In reality, it’s quite easy to launch an informative and educational pod-
cast for your agency or not-for-profit (NFP). It’s also easy to follow secu-
rity protocols, control distribution, and accomplish a quality podcast
with minimal financial investment.
Why Government and NFP 
Agencies Should Podcast
The big question that begins the debate: Why should our agency podcast?
That question launches the brainstorming and eventual direction of the
podcast. Without the reason behind the podcast, your podcast goes
nowhere.
And there are plenty of reasons why you want your agency to podcast:

Why Government and NFP Agencies Should Podcast
367
Training
On-the-job training to implement new software, new
hardware, or new policies is always a continuous
sinkhole of time. While trying to meet goals and
deadlines for the fiscal year, something new is pre-
sented in the workplace, and time must be set aside
for proper orientation and training to understand
what it will bring to the office.
The problem with training is that it can (and in most
cases, does) take employees away from the office
for days. In the meantime, e-mail, responsibilities,
and current to-do items begin to stack up — slowing
productivity till it lags behind the current schedule.
With podcasts, employees can download training
sessions to their computers and either transfer
them to portable mp3 players or listen them to at
their desks while meeting other goals of the day.
Yes, this kind of efficiency will rely on how good you
(and your co-workers) are at multitasking, but one
great benefit is that this type of training does not
take individuals away from their desks for days on
end. Training delivered through this method can
also be given a hint of flexibility. The sessions can
be entertaining, informative, and — if enhanced 
podcasts are implemented — interactive.
Current events and announcements
Printed newsletters have long been the preferred
way to get the message out to your staff concerning
news, upcoming seminars, and events beneficial 
to your agency. The problem with printed news-
letters is in their distribution, cost, and — more
importantly — the time they take to produce and to
read. Take a casual survey and find out exactly how
many of your co-workers have read those news-
letters. Compare those numbers to how many em-
ployees have set them aside for later reading. For
some agencies, e-mail bulletins have attempted to
replace the conventional print newsletters, but the
temptation to “print for later” (or even set aside and
mark for a later review) is no different from the
impulse to set aside a hard-copy newsletter.
Podcasting provides a cost-effective solution to
newsletters in that time, finances, and resources
invested into print are replaced by the production
time of recording and editing news articles. The
audio medium can also provide a more direct means
of delivering news to agencies, depending on how
the news is delivered. It’s one thing to read about a
current event or a policy change, but hearing news
and issues can carry more of an impact. Along with
taking advantage of the impact of audio, delivery of
the file can be confirmed easily with a check of the
subscription list and download stats.
The content of your news podcast will also be more
dynamic than its print counterpart. With audio,
interviews and comments featured in printed mate-
rial suddenly come alive with the actual voice of the
person interviewed.
Every section of your podcast can be voiced
by a different department head or editor, and
reports from seminars and events can be on-
location interviews with convention attendees
and keynote speakers. Through podcasting, a
newsletter has more of an impact on its target
audience. 
Public relations
The best way to deal with misconceptions and mis-
interpretations of agencies’ agendas and actions is
to improve public relations between your organiza-
tion and the outside world. One definition of public
relations is “the state of the relationship between the
public and a company or other organization or a
famous person,” and podcasting is quickly becom-
ing a new means of strengthening this relationship.
A podcast allows you to give either a formal look at
your agency (with a structured, organized show for-
mat) or a more casual view (with a free-form behind-
the-scenes look). Whatever option you decide to
pursue, your podcast becomes an audio connection
to the outside world and a platform for the general
public to hear your agency’s perspective.

supporters, or other NFP representatives searching
for solutions) with a weekly, biweekly, or monthly
report on what your organization is doing to further
the mission of your NFP. 
Other applications of your podcast can include
interviews with other NFP representatives, experts
in the field your NFP focuses on, and individuals
who are part of your agency and help make it run.
Your podcast can also encourage community from
your subscribers, giving them a way of becoming
involved in your NFP’s mission.
This podcast is your chance to inform your sub-
scribers and even your own group. Some podcasts
specifically educate NFP groups on how to keep
things running efficiently or how to start up a NFP
for a cause they believe in. The 501c3Cast (www.
501c3cast.com) is an independent podcast hosted
and produced by people dedicated to helping NFP
professionals and volunteers through a bi-weekly
podcast. The 501c3Cast (shown in Figure 45-2) cov-
ers issues, concerns, and solutions from personal
experiences and other NFP groups, nationwide 
and from around the world, creating a community
dedicated to making things happen.

Working within Government
Guidelines
Practice 44 offers some tips for opening discussions
and keeping the IT staff happy when you approach
them with plans to upload mp3s onto the company’s
Web server. If you think facing IT groups is difficult,
try making the podcast pitch to the government. 
U.S. government organizations such as the USDA,
Armed Forces (all branches), and National Park
Service all use podcasting as a way to get their mes-
sage (and their angle on what’s happening) out to
the world. Your podcast can be a window into your
world, and that’s what PR is all about.
Every week, the Pentagon Channel does just that
with Rucksacks & Rations, a podcast featuring inter-
views with American soldiers stationed everywhere
from Alabama to Afghanistan (see Figure 45-1). This
podcast is less about the news and more about the
people who are making the news. Alongside
Rucksacks & Rations, the Pentagon Channel presents
programming of all kinds for both active military
and families and friends of the military, offering a
different viewpoint on situations at home and
around the world. 
• Figure 45-1: Rucksacks & Rations, a podcast from the

Outreach programs
Many NFP agencies are geared for education and
social awareness, but getting your agency’s message
out to the public can provide a challenge when you
have a limited budget. Podcasting, though, offers up
your NFP’s mission to a worldwide audience and can
attract new traffic to your Web site.
NFP organizations benefit the most by networking
with other NFP groups. Podcasting can provide
your subscribers (be they supporters, potential

Working within Government Guidelines
369
The government can make the implementation of a
podcast an act of Congress. (Literally.) Along with
security issues, many government agencies have
stringent policies on what can (and cannot) be
downloaded to office computers and servers. Some
of these prohibited applications include Skype and
iTunes, two of the most important tools covered in
this book. You also need to go through the approval
process to download other applications essential to
podcasting such as HotRecorder, Call Recorder, and
other applications.
Doing your homework
Before planning a podcast, you will want to prepare
for tackling paperwork and policy, and this will
mean coming up with answers for your supervisors
and IT representatives. Here are some of the ques-
tions you’ll need to answer:

How secure will the downloading be? If your
agency’s podcast is geared more to the internal
employees of the agency, you can create secure
RSS feeds that cannot be downloaded outside
the agency’s intranet. If you want to be listed on
nonsecure directories, such as Podcast Pickle,
Podcast Alley, and iTunes, then you will want to
make clear that the RSS feed will be featured on
your agency’s public Web site. (Heck, even the
CIA has a public Web site.) The RSS feed, be it
private or public, is a one-way port of access.
This isn’t peer-to-peer, but rather a syndication
of mp3, PDF, or video files going from the server
to subscribers. 

How safe are these downloads? While Skype can
be used as an instant messenger, the most basic
of firewalls disables the ability to exchange files
from user to user. Skype, HotRecorder, and Call
Recorder are all safe, virus-free downloads.
iTunes, developed by Apple, Inc., is also a com-
pletely safe download. Other well-known mp3
player software — such as Windows Media Player
(developed by Microsoft), Real Media (developed
by Real Media), and QuickTime (developed by
Apple) — are also checked and verified as virus-
free before they’re offered for downloading.

Who will the audience be? This will decide
exactly how much work you will have when
developing the RSS feed for the podcast. The
advantages in developing a podcast for a govern-
ment intranet is that you have control over what
people will be using as their listening device.
You can decide on either iTunes or Juice for
everyone in the agency (using a player like Juice
limits access to distractions at work, such as the
iTunes Music Store). These standards can also
be applied to recording software and other post-
production applications. 
If your podcast is for the general public, the RSS
feed can be kept to the basics and even iTunes-
friendly. Then you’ll need to have a show format
planned so your supervisors and superiors have
an idea what your podcast is about.
Considering workarounds
There will be other discussions and issues beyond
the three just mentioned — and you might face
some opposition to the downloading of unapproved
software. So while the podcast itself may be encour-
aged, applications such as Skype may not be allowed.
If you run into software roadblocks, what are your
options?

Download Skype at home. Because Skype is a
safe and free download, there is no risk on your
end for downloading and using it for interviews
on your home computer. It may be a challenge
to be reimbursed for your download of
HotRecorder or Call Recorder, but the invest-
ment is inexpensive at $16 USD. You can then
record your own interviews at home and bring
in the audio for post-production editing.

Record after hours, off-site. You may be unable
to record during work hours (or from your cubi-
cle after hours) due to security clearances and
the like. Still, the podcast needs to be produced.
Take your production off-site. Record from your
home or a comfortable social location like a
quiet corner in a favorite restaurant. The pod-
cast may sound more informal if placed in a

ArtsEdge 
(http://artsedge.kennedy-center.
org), the National Arts Education Network, is hosted by
the Kennedy Center, dedicated to bringing the arts, art 
history, and art-related programming to the Internet. In
January 2006, Director Nuit Hansgen and Instructional
Media Developer Kristin Holodak launched the ArtsEdge
Podcast with The Sounds of China, highlights from the
2006 China Festival. They observed, “We knew we wanted
to podcast, but what would make great audio? What’s
going to make a great story?” Hansgen then turned to the
upcoming China extravaganza: “We had an amazing
opportunity with the China Festival, so we started taping as
much as we could. Could we come up with a fantastic
piece or a beautiful failure that we can learn from?”
Instead, ArtsEdge created a fantastic piece that everyone
could learn from. More separate feeds followed, including
one large master feed that features both audio and video
podcasts, called (rather appropriately) The Kitchen Sink
(http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/
podcasts/allArtsedge.xml).
The Kennedy Center’s ArtsEdge figured podcasting would
be a hit with their ArtsEdge users, but it was the global
response that caught Hansgen off-guard. “A huge majority
of our subscribers were in China. It wasn’t just local com-
munity-Washington, D.C., folks who were coming out to
the festival. It wasn’t just ArtsEdge users. It was the power
of being able to pull it up through the podcast catalogs and
subscribing to it.”
Holodak finds that what ArtsEdge is doing seems tailor-
made for podcasting: “I’m generating content constantly.
We are either shooting video or talking to [artists] on audio.
Endless source material, and it becomes a matter of how
do I get this out to my users? Podcasting fits that so well.
They find us once, they subscribe, and then I arrive on their
doorstep.” 
And what is the next podcasting idea from ArtsEdge?
“Ben Franklin’s iPod.” Hansgen reveals. “What would be on
Ben Franklin’s iPod, if he had one?” 
social setting, but you can find a location else-
where and bring the audio in for additional edit-
ing. The cost here is in the time and effort
required to set up your podcast for recording on
your time. 

Limit early episodes’ running times. Who will
your audience be? What are the expectations?
How much bandwidth will your agency allow for
your podcast? Your first few shows should be
short and sweet, somewhere within the 10-to-
20-minute range. From here, superiors can 
listen or review the early episodes, and either
greenlight longer episodes or approve the cur-
rent direction of the podcast. By keeping the
running times of your starting five episodes to
between 10 and 20 minutes each, you keep the
investment in recording and post-production
time to a minimum. There is still an investment,
but hardly at the level of a podcast running close
to the hour mark.
Keeping your eyes on the prize
It may sound like you have to jump through a lot of
hoops before you get to Episode #0 of your agency’s
podcast, but remember: Keep your focus on the
intent of your podcast. The road to the podcast’s
launch may not be as easy as launching your own
podcast, but are you keeping in mind the goals that
you’ve mapped out? This production is not neces-
sarily for you but for the agency you work for, fur-
thering its mission statement and finding a new
audience that will support your organization in the
future.
A legacy reaches a global audience
Part not-for-profit, part Presidential memorial, The Kennedy
Center (www.kennedy-center.org) in Washington,

who wanted to offer the arts to everyone, everywhere. Had
he lived long enough to see the advent of podcasting, he
would have seen his dream realized.

So long as you keep an eye on the drive and the
intent of your podcast, the application of your pod-
cast is limitless. Government and NFP agencies now

a national and international level — with minimal
financial investment.

Podcasting
P
odcasting will make you an overnight success! (Uh-huh.) Business
entrepreneurs, aspiring writers, and ambitious politicians who’ve
scaled that peak may lead you to believe that when it comes to big
bucks, windfalls of critical acclaim, and runaway notoriety, podcasting is
the Acela of gravy trains. That, sad to say, would be podcasting in the
still-elusive perfect world we all long for.
But how essential is podcasting in the promotions arena? Can podcasting
get the word out about your business, your book, your music, or what-
ever you wish to introduce to the consumer? And can podcasting get the
word out to a captive audience without breaking your financial budget?
The answer to these questions is yes, yes, and ooohh yes. For a fraction
of the cost of conventional radio advertising, your message, product, or
upcoming event can reach an audience that is local, regional, national,
and international.
You may not become an overnight success on account of podcasting,
but you can get your message around the world and back again
overnight. As a promotions tool, podcasting is invaluable.
Examining What Goes into 
the Promotional Podcast
As much as we, the creative minds behind this book, would love to tell
you differently, podcasting is not the get-rich-quick solution of the
Internet, nor is it going to make you a superstar. Did it reinvent MTV 
veejay Adam Curry? Yes. Did podcasting introduce Scott Sigler to the
publishing industry? That it did. Did two stay-at-home moms win over a
major advertising budget for their podcast about being stay-at-home
moms? Very true. All  these people — Curry, Sigler, and The MommyCast —
had to work their tails off in the beginning days of podcasting and con-
tinue to work their tails off to maintain the momentum. So, is podcasting
a profitable venture? It can be, but rarely.

Making Sure You Have a Plan for Your Promo

On a promotional front, podcasting helped these
folks reach new audiences, audiences hungry for the
content these podcasters were talking about:

For Curry, The Daily Source Code (www.daily
sourcecode.com) is the promotion of podcast-
ing, a brand-new way of generating and delivering
content to people everywhere. Indirectly, the
podcast is also a promotional vehicle for Adam
Curry, establishing him as an authority (other-
wise known as The Podfather) in this new
medium. 

For Scott Sigler (www.scottsigler.net), his
podcast novels EarthCore, Ancestor, Infection,
and The Rookie promoted his books. Ultimately,
he scored book contracts with two publishers. 

The MommyCast promotes the art of being stay-
at-home moms, shattering the myth that stay-at-
home parenting is a cushy job. Dixie Cups,
serving up the sponsorship paycheck, knew that
these women would also promote its product
because it was something they used around the
house. Everyone listening to The MommyCast is,
in fact, the target audience.
So, how did these folks make their shows a hit while
promoting consciously or subliminally an idea,
product, or concept? The secret to their success is
in what makes a good podcast into a really good
podcast: content. These podcasters had a clear idea
of what they wanted their podcasts to offer —
whether it was commentary on the world around
them or worlds they dreamed up — and they deliv-
ered it with conviction, confidence, and clarity.
Podcasting has proven itself to be a fantastic way to
reach new audiences. National Public Radio, by pod-
casting its popular offerings like Car Talk, Fresh Air,
and Studio 360, opened up these shows to new audi-
ences downloading content from iTunes. Via video
podcasting, Pixar Studios generated hype for the film
Ratatouille, with The Ratatouille Video Podcast, which
went behind the scenes of this culinary comedy.
Then, in the political arena, Barack Obama has taken
a page from Senator John Edwards’ podcasting play-
book with The Official Barack Obama Video Podcast.
What all these podcasts focus on is not so much
what they are promoting, but what their episode’s
content will be.
When planning a podcast that will be a promotion of
something or someone, go back to the basics of
planning the podcast itself:

What will the podcast’s direction be? 

Do you have content that can span five shows
and still engage the audience? 

Where will the show be six months from now?

What’s the show’s posting schedule? 

What’s the show’s running time? 
When you have the content for the podcast planned,
then focus on the promotional angle. How do you
want to promote your agenda? In the opening?
During the outro? You can also cite Web sites and
organizations in your ID3 tags (See, told you those
things would come in handy!) and even at key
moments in enhanced podcasts.
A successful promotional podcast plans for the
promotion around its content. Without good
content, the podcast fails.
Making Sure You Have 
a Plan for Your Promo
So suppose you decide that promotion should take
precedence over planning a format or mapping out
content for your podcast. Let the show just happen
and evolve on its own. After all, isn’t that what pod-
casting is all about? Spur-of-the-moment? Off the
cuff? In the moment?

Sadly, we’ll always have Paris
The textbook example of what not to do in a podcast
occurred in April 2005 when the publicity crew behind a
remake of the 3-D horror classic House of Wax decided it
would be a good idea to launch The Paris Hilton Podcast,
hosted by the heiress, supermodel, and the film’s support-
ing actress herself. Paris would record podcasts running
between 5 to 10 minutes that would generate hype for the
upcoming thriller.
From the overly produced opening and the vapid, bored
demeanor of the show’s host, it was clear that Hilton was
handed a recorder and told to talk about anything (appar-
ently she could only do this in 10-minute increments) and
to promote the movie at least once during the podcast. She
did mention House of Wax, usually in the first minute. The
remainder of the show’s content consisted of contrived
banter, shopping, and patronizing photographers and fans
all screaming for her attention.
The podcast did little to help generate hype for House of
Wax, a movie that lasted at the box office as long as the
podcast lasted in production. The lesson learned is that
there is more to a podcast than just hitting the red button
on a digital recorder and flying by the seat of your pants.
Particularly when it comes to promotion, a plan is needed.
Otherwise, the end result is The Paris Hilton Podcast, one of
the most ill-executed promotional podcasts due to its lack
of direction and planning. 
Show’s Over — Nothing 
More to See Here
Podcasting for promotional purposes has a quality
about it that many other podcasts do not have (and
which we zero in on at the end of this book): an end.
With a podcast that pushes your upcoming product,
election, or appearance, you’re generating hype and
attention for yourself, and then the event happens.
Provided you implement other means of getting the
word out, you have a fantastic showing at your
event. A day or two later, you begin to think a bit
about the podcast and the listenership that you
have cultivated. Depending on when you do your

such a case, the podcast is well on its way to becom-
ing an infomercial. If that’s what you want, check out
Practice 44 for ways to make the show effective in
that role. Otherwise, indulge your inner master
planner a bit.
In some situations, companies and corporations
want to launch a podcast “because it’s a cool thing
to do” and an even better way to promote their busi-
ness. But if you ask the potential podcaster, “So
what will your podcast be about?” you may want to
prepare for the answer of “I don’t know” because
that is usually the inevitable one. It’s also a clue:
These are the potential podcasters needing to be
talked out of podcasting because they care little
about the podcast and are caught up in the high
returns with minimal investments.
Well, let’s be clear — minimal financial investments.
Podcasting to promote yourself, your business, or
your agenda is a good reason to podcast, but it
shouldn’t be the podcast. When putting together
your promotional podcast, ask yourself the follow-
ing questions:

What do you want to say? 

What is your message? 

Are you willing to invest your time, resources,
and efforts into creating a good podcast? 
Promotional podcasting, contrary to the message of
self-made millionaires who work from home, is not a
one-way ticket to overnight success; it’s merely a
tool. Anyone can buy a power drill and a nail gun,
but the carpenter who has the plans to the summer
home is the one who knows how to get the most out
of them. The same thing is true with your podcast:
Without a plan, your idea goes nowhere. 

Show’s Over — Nothing More to See Here
375
podcast — weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly — you
note the date and think, “They’re expecting more
content.”
But . . . you’re done. Now what do you do?
Unlike podcasts that launch and plan for the future,
promotional podcasts should actually do the oppo-
site: Plan for the future before you launch. After
your event, product release, or ultimate goal is
reached, what will you do with the podcast audience
you have amassed? Will the podcast end? Will you
want to revisit it in the future? Will it sit in the
Podcast Pickle directory, merely gathering dust until
someone comes across it? The easiest thing to do
when your podcast is done is simply to say, “We’re
done. Goodnight. Go home. It’s over!” But there are
also other options you can consider:

Scale back show postings to a monthly sched-
ule and make it a “What’s Happening Now”
show. When Scott Sigler’s podcast novels hit
their conclusions, he podcasts a monthly show
called The Bloodcast where he podcasts other
(but related) content: short stories, updates to
upcoming appearances, and any developments
on his upcoming titles. He maintains the connec-
tion with his listeners with the periodic updates. 
Scaling back your show to a monthly posting
schedule is an excellent way to keep your
audience engaged without cutting ties
completely.

Announce a hiatus between this podcast and a
new season. Perhaps you will want to revisit this
podcast in the future, either as a recap of what
has happened since the event you are promoting
or to announce upcoming appearances and
developments of your podcast’s original promo-
tion. In this case, announce that your podcast
will be taking a break. Encourage your listener-
ship to stay subscribed to this podcast’s feed for
an upcoming second season and give an approxi-
mate date for the new season.

Record content from the event your podcast is
promoting and offer it as future installments
for the podcast. Paul Fisher and Martha
Holloway of DancingCat Studios produce and
host The Balticon Podcast (http://balticon
podcast.org), a bi-monthly and monthly pod-
cast that promotes Baltimore’s Memorial Day
science-fiction-and-fantasy convention. Before
the weekend that TBC is currently promoting,
Paul and Martha play interviews from the previ-
ous Balticon, ending these episodes with, “If you
like what you’ve heard, make plans for Balticon
this year.” After the current year’s Balticon
begins, Paul and Martha start collecting inter-
views and events for the next season of TBP. By
following this pattern, promotion continues for
Balticon, and new content is generated for the
next season of the podcast.

Package the podcast episodes and either dis-
tribute them for pay or as part of another prod-
uct. For Tim Borouquin of The Podcast Brothers
and Podcast and New Media Expo (both found at
http://newmediaexpo.com), special events
and speaker presentations are recorded and
offered as both free and paid subscription pod-
casts. The free podcasts are his promotion for
the upcoming expo, featuring status reports,
acknowledgment of new sponsors, and selec-
tions from featured speakers of the previous
expos. On the paid subscription feed, listeners
can virtually attend the previous year’s program-
ming, hearing the panels and talks recorded live. 
NBC/Universal and The SciFi Channel on their
DVD release of Battlestar Galactica will package
Ron Moore’s podcast as an extra feature. And
Wiley Publishing has included Season One of
Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion
Podcast on the DVD that comes with this book.
Repackaging the podcast is a terrific solution
for any possible issues with server space — and
also provides your clientele with an invaluable
audio resource. 

Practice 46: Promotional Podcasting

There is also the choice to simply end the podcast
with a “Th-th-th-that’s All Folks!” kind of episode,
closing up shop and letting the podcast end on your
terms, your way. What is important to keep in mind
here is that you have many options for your podcast
after the promotion is done. You can keep it simple
with a farewell episode or hard podfade (covered in
detail in Part VIII) or explore other options of distri-
bution and production. The way you want to wrap it
up is your call.
A plan, a promotion, a successful podcast 
Back in the summer of 2005, Wiley Publishing was kicking
around some ideas for promoting Podcasting For Dummies.
Tee Morris, suggested, “Why don’t we do a companion
podcast for the book?”
The phone went silent for a moment, and then came,
“Why didn’t we think of that?”
Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast went
online in January 2006, posting twice a month with some-
thing new in podcasting or offering a more in-depth look
at a topic from the book. Tee initially planned out 12
episodes, but the season eventually grew to 20 episodes as
the podcast rocketed to the top of the iTunes Technology
rankings, increased traffic to ForDummies.com, and (more
importantly) sold books.
And yes, with this title, Tee returns with Season Two of
Podcasting for Dummies: The Companion Podcast. He is
also bringing to the podosphere Podcasting For Dummies:
Enhanced, a special feed that offers enhanced and video
episodes! New media in action, folks.

Adding Advertising
to Your Podcast
I
n Practice 43, we give a brief overview of several ways in which you
can derive revenue from your podcast. We also try to stress that pod-
casting and profiting don’t necessarily go hand in hand — and that the
road to podcast-driven riches is largely unexplored territory as of this
writing. But we recognize that this won’t always be the case, and that
many enterprising people and organizations will figure out the secret
sauce that enables them and others a clear path to the pot of gold at the
end of the RSS feed. (How’s that for a mixed metaphor?)
This practice focuses specifically on running advertisements inside of
your podcast. As we have tried to repeatedly stress, you are not required
to turn your podcast into a moneymaker in order to be considered
expert. But we do recognize that many of our readers would like to see
some income in exchange for their efforts. For those folks, advertising
represents the low-hanging fruit of revenue generation. Okay, implement-
ing advertising in your podcast may not actually be all that easy to do,
but it’s by far the easiest methodology to explain. There’s more to it than
you might think.
Measuring Audience Demographics
Before you start firing off the e-mails or calling up potential sponsors of
your show, you’ll want to get your ducks in a row. Many of the companies
you’ll be approaching have been spending money in traditional media
(radio, print, TV) for a long time. They probably have sophisticated
media property evaluation processes already in place and are likely to
ask you for some hard facts about your show. “My show is really good” is
not a hard fact.
It’s going to be very difficult to convince someone to pay for the privilege
of marketing to your audience if you don’t know much about your audi-
ence. Figuring out how many people are listening is important, but so is
understanding who these people are — and what sorts of behavior they
are likely to engage in when they’re not listening to your podcast.

solutions other than these, and we applaud them for
their efforts. But if you just want reliable and near-
standardized numbers, try out these good tools.
Profiling your audience
Knowing how many people are listening is helpful,
but potential advertisers are also going to want to
know some information about these people:

How old are they? 

How much income do they have? 

What products are they interested in? 

How much money do they have to spend?
This is the true meat of audience profiling, and you
get that data by conducting surveys.
Choosing a service to create the survey
Plenty of survey-creation options exist, many
of which are completely free to use. Try
FreeOnlineSurveys.com or SurveyMethods.com to
start. They’ll allow you to create your own list of
questions, but keep in mind that these tools don’t
give you many options beyond that. If you don’t
want your audience exposed to the advertising from
these services, or want a lot more control on the
look and feel of the survey, check out Survey
Monkey (http://surveymonkey.com) and
Zoomerang (http://zoomerang.com). You’ll part
with a few bucks, but you’ll have a lot more say over
the look and feel.
If you are with the advertising network Kiptronic
(kiptronic.com), it has a built-in survey applica-
tion that all of its affiliate podcasters can use. There
are some basic questions, but the system is flexible
enough to allow for some custom questions.
Deciding what questions to ask
Before you start driving your audience to your sur-
vey, you need to plan out your questions. Remember
that the goal of the survey is to gather information
Determining the size of your audience
A good place to start is audience size. You have a
variety of tools at your disposal to help you gauge
how many people are listening to your podcast:

Count your subscribers. If you are already using
FeedBurner (http://feedburner.com), this is
a simple task. FeedBurner uses a sophisticated
(though not perfect) methodology of analyzing
all of the accesses to your podcast’s RSS feed.
You can read up about it on the FeedBurner Web
site if you like. Or you could take our word for 
it — it’s the most likely candidate for a standard-
ized method of estimating subscribers.

Count your downloads. Not all your listeners
will bother to subscribe to your RSS feed. In fact,
many podcasters find that subscribers make up
less than half of their total downloads. If you are
using PodPress (covered in Practice 26) and
have enabled tracking, you are already covered.
PodPress will give you a count of the number of
times one of your episodes was downloaded —
whether from a subscriber or someone listening
to your show right from your Web site. 
A quick note on the accuracy of these — and
all other — metrics discussed in this practice.
They are, at best, imperfect. Eliminating dupli-
cates and trying to get to the true meaning of
unique downloads are puzzles that have yet
to be solved. So take these — and all other —
numbers with a grain of salt. In fact, make
that a whole dash of salt.
This is all good and fine if you’re using both
FeedBurner and PodPress. But what if you aren’t?
Well, in that case you have to get into some fairly
heavy Web-server-log analysis; the log is where all
these statistics are tracked. But the brass tacks of
parsing server log files is outside of the scope of this
book. Try Web Analytics For Dummies (by Pedro
Sostre and Jennifer LeClaire, from Wiley) if you find
yourself in this situation. Or better yet, really con-
sider using FeedBurner and PodPress. We know that
quite a few technical-minded podcasters prefer to use

Measuring Audience Demographics
379
that’s important to potential advertisers, and not to
satisfy your own curiosity. Advertisers probably
don’t care what other podcasts your audience is lis-
tening to and how folks discovered your program. In
fact, their needs whittle down to three main pieces
of information:

Age

Sex

Income
Understanding these three data points about your
audience will give you and your potential advertisers
a good look at who is listening to your show. Once
you know who is listening, you can start to make
some assumptions as to what types of products and
services your audience is likely to care about. 
Not all advertisers will be satisfied with these three
data points. Because podcast advertising is still new
to many companies, gathering additional data, such
as the following, is a good idea:

Occupation

Education

Family size

Marital status
Going a step further, try to anticipate what informa-
tion an advertiser might be interested in. If you’re
going to approach companies that do the majority of
their business directly with consumers via the
Internet, you may wish to ask how much money
your listeners have spent online in the last 12
months. If you are going after the automotive indus-
try, find out what kinds of cars your listeners drive
and how often they have their cars serviced. Going
after a do-it-yourself home-improvement company?
Find out about home ownership. Think about whom
your company’s target audience is likely to be —
and then ask your listeners whether they fit the bill.
One company, PodTrac (www.podtrac.com), takes
care of much of this heavy lifting for you. You don’t
have much (read: any) control over the questions
asked, but it asks a wide enough range of questions
so that you can get a good handle on who is listen-
ing. Even better — it uses this data to build you a
very nice media kit to give out to potential advertis-
ers. (We cover media kits a bit later in this practice.)
Compelling your audience to take the survey
Once you have the questions planned out and have
selected a company or service to collect the infor-
mation for you, you need to get your audience to
participate in the survey. Make this easy for them by
providing a link to your survey in the show notes on
each episode — that’s where you talk about the sur-
vey and drive your audience to take it.
Don’t think you can mention it just once and have
most of your listeners rush to take the survey. For
four to six episodes, plan on talking about the sur-
vey and asking more and more of your listeners to
take it. After the first mention, be appreciative of
those who have taken the survey on subsequent
episodes. Feel free to plead for their compliance, but
do it in an apologetic manner. Few people enjoy tak-
ing surveys, and your understanding of this can go a
long way toward convincing reluctant people to help
you out by taking part.
And now for a dose of reality — you should
expect only a small percentage (perhaps in
the single digits) of your listeners to actually
follow your request. But that’s okay; you need
not get a 50% compliance rate to generate
relevant findings. 
Keep in mind that most of the statistics you see on
the news or in print are derived from extremely
small sample sizes in comparison with the total pop-
ulation. We know we’ve never been called by some-
one to inquire about our opinions on the job the
President is doing. But someone is comfortable
enough with the science of statistics to extrapolate
the feelings of the country based on a few thousand
(or hundred) random samples. And if that’s good
enough for politics, it’s good enough for podcasting!

Practice 47: Adding Advertising to Your Podcast
380
Hey, welcome to the club. It’s a brave new industry
that you’ve found yourself in, and it’s just different
enough from anything else as to render years and
years of historical advertising pricing completely
worthless to you. Here’s yet another place where
podcasters have to strike out on their own.
While we don’t have an easy answer about what to
charge advertisers, we do have some advice:

Pick a price and stick with it. You never want to
pick up the phone or make a sales call without
having preselected how much you’re going to
charge. So figure out how much you want, and
then finesse that into some numbers that might
help justify the amount. What does that break
down to on a per-listener basis? How amazingly
targeted is your show that the advertiser is get-
ting no waste? Be confident, and be firm. 
Don’t discount your rate right off the bat —
and never discount it much more than 15%. 
If you deepen that discount, it implies that
you’ve padded your original number. As Dave
Slusher of the Evil Genius Chronicles says,
“You can never sell out. You can only sell too
cheap.” Those are words to live by.

Don’t sell yourself short. Large companies like
to write checks for large sums of money. We’re
not suggesting you should overcharge, but you
should also know that companies are presented
with fantastic opportunities every day. They
have limited resources — they’re forced to pick
and choose the ones that can have the greatest
impact on their business.
Also, the larger the sum, the more likely some-
one with greater decision-making potential will
get involved. If you ask for a few hundred dol-
lars, no one important may take note. Change
that to a few thousand? Now you’re getting
someone’s attention. 
Building a Media Kit
Once you understand enough about your podcast 
to sell it, you need to package that information in a
media kit. The purpose of the media kit is simple —
to get someone at an organization or company
interested to the point of calling you back. It’s not
designed to sell your podcast. Sorry, but it won’t.
That’s your job. (Or the job of some salesperson you
hire.) But before you can do that, you need to get
the company’s attention with a rock-solid media kit.
In Chapter 37, we give you the lowdown on what
types of materials you’ll want to include in your
media kit. Additionally, we also wanted to give you
some excellent real-world examples of media kits. So
take a look at the DVD that comes with this book. In
it, you’ll find media kits for

Trader Interviews

Grape Radio

J.C. Hutchins
Examine them. Borrow from them. And make them
your own. Remember: The idea is to get someone
interested enough to listen to your pitch. A great
media kit (yeah, you’ll want to spend a few bucks
on it) can be what gets your foot in the door.
Establishing a Fair Rate
You’ve received great survey data from your audi-
ence. You’ve developed an exceptional media kit
that will strike fear into the hearts of those who dare
not sponsor your show. You are ready to start the
thrilling undertaking of making cold calls and knock-
ing on doors. And you don’t have the first idea of
how much to charge.

Creating an Advertising Plan
381

Don’t price-gouge. Yes, we realize this dictum
may seem to be in opposition to what we just
said here. But in all honesty, you have to give
them their money’s worth. Since you need to
charge a lot to get their attention, give them a
lot. You could make the campaign longer (like
several months instead of a few weeks), or you
can sweeten the pot with additional ad units.
(See the next section for ideas.) The takeaway:
Make it worth their while.

Follow the market. Advertising in podcasts,
while still in the early stages, has been happen-
ing since 2005. That’s given ample time for ideas
to be tried and tested, and fair rates to be set. 
Find a podcast similar to yours that is accepting
ads, and see what it charges. You can just call
the podcasters who run the show, or e-mail them
to ask, if you like. If you feel a little strange about
this, you can fall back to the same thing that
traditional media sites do to keep up with the
competition — price-shop them. Yes, it’s rather
dishonest to pretend to be someone you are not,
looking for a service that you really won’t buy.
But it’s how things work in business. If that
makes you uncomfortable, so be it. But we’d be
remiss if we didn’t give you the option.
The various ad networks discussed in Practice
43 are usually quite happy to discuss the pric-
ing terms they think they can get for your pod-
cast. Call or e-mail them to see what they have
to say. Be prepared to discuss download num-
bers, show composition, and other pertinent
details about your show — and to sit through a
sales pitch on why you should join their net-
work. (Which maybe you should. Your call.)
Creating an Advertising Plan
So . . . do you have all of that stuff figured out?
Great. Time to figure out a plan for how you’ll inte-
grate advertising messages into your podcast as a
whole — including your Web site. There isn’t (and
shouldn’t be) a one-size-fits-all approach to design-
ing a successful advertising plan for podcasts. Too
many divergent factors come into play — and way
too many podcasters are staunch independents who
want to do their own thing. We embrace this philos-
ophy and encourage lots of creative flexibility while
you’re coming up with a plan.
Some of this flexibility may become more
standardized in the near future. Recently, a
group called The Association for Downloadable
Media was formed, with the express purpose
of developing some standards for podcasters
who are seeking advertisers. It’s still very early
in the formative stages of this organization; we
fully expect that other competing organiza-
tions will come on the scene. Keep your eyes
on this space.
Pre-/post-rolls
As you might have guessed, a pre-roll ad is one that
plays before your episode gets started. Conversely,
a post-roll happens after the episode has finished
playing. As of this writing, pre- and post-roll com-
mercials are the mainstay of podcast advertising;
networks like Podshow (http://podshow.com) and
Kiptronic (http://kiptronic.com) have their own
customized ad-insertion technologies that allow ads
to be dropped into shows before they’re downloaded
by listeners.
That’s the big plus of a pre-roll ad to podcasters —
no extra work is required to add the audio to existing
or future episodes. Of course, you can use pre- and
post-roll ads without these inserting technologies.
And it’s not like the editing is that hard, anyhow.
Inserting technologies also make it easy to remove or
change ads after a campaign is over. Again, you can
do this on your own, but now you’re talking about re-
editing old shows to update the ads. Not very fun.

Practice 47: Adding Advertising to Your Podcast
382
Interstitial ads
The polar opposite of the pre-/post roll — in applica-
tion and design — is the interstitial. Interstitial ads
run between segments of your show, or when you
change from one topic to another. If you’ve listened
to U.S. commercial radio or watched any amount of
U.S.-based television, you’ve been exposed to count-
less hours of this type of advertising.
Benefits? You are playing ads inside of the show,
with plenty of show content before and after the
advertisements. You don’t have to worry about turn-
ing someone off before you start your program. Nor
do you have to worry (too much) about them stick-
ing around after the show is over to hear the ads.
Interstitial ads can also (surprisingly enough) make
your show sound more professional, as you are mir-
roring a format (broadcast media) that the audience
is most familiar with.
That last piece of advice can come back to
haunt you. A large section of the current pod-
cast listening audience enjoys this medium
precisely because it does not sound like tradi-
tional media. So exercise caution before mak-
ing your show sound too produced.
As you might have expected, interstitial ads do
bring some challenges. First of all, it’s very difficult
to run any sort of automated ad insertions inside a
show. Sure, many of the networks claim to be able to
do this seamlessly, but we’ve yet to see a good solid
execution of this premise. So for now, most pod-
casters are stuck dropping in the ads, either as they
create or edit the show. 
Also, it’s easy to overload a show with interstitial
ads. Pre- and post-roll ads are self-limiting, but
there’s nothing stopping a podcaster from stringing
together two or three ads at a break, and making
three or four breaks in the show. Nothing, that is,
except two factors: (a) not having enough advertis-
ers and (b) a good implementation of common
sense. Keep the ads in your show infrequent and
short. Please?
But pre-roll and post-roll ads suffer from a bit of a
character flaw: Many podcasters don’t see them as
effective. And some, like Rob Walch from podCast411
(http://podcast411.com), see them as a down-
right hindrance. The main argument? You want the
very first thing a potential subscriber of your show
to hear is your voice — or at least the sights and
sounds of your podcast. When you run a pre-roll,
your show runs behind the ad. It’s possible that the
ad will turn some people off or confuse others who
didn’t have their expectations met immediately. 
The issue with post-roll is a bit different. The ques-
tion is raised: Who’s hanging around to listen to an
advertisement after the show has concluded? Unlike
broadcast media, podcasting is vulnerable to easy
fast-forwarding by the podcast audience. How big of
a concern is this? That depends on whom you ask.
There is little question that, as of this writing, pre-
rolls dominate the industry, while post-roll ads only
account for a small fraction of that size. 
Our advice:

Keep pre-rolls short. Fifteen seconds is a long
time to a listener — plenty of time to get most
promotional messages across. You can go longer
than this if you wish, but then you run a serious
chance of alienating your audience (which
increases with the length of your commercial
messages).

Pre-sell the post-roll. Knowing that many listen-
ers are quick with the FFW button when they
near the end of your episode, give them a reason
to keep listening. The chance to hear a wonder-
fully produced advertisement usually isn’t much
of an incentive, and you certainly don’t want to
trick anyone into listening. But special offers
and other beneficial incentives are fine ways to
pre-sell — perhaps in a pre-roll advertisement
to use in conjunction with the post-roll.

Creating an Insertion Order
383
Host endorsements
Here’s another trick borrowed from traditional
media — have the host of your show talk about the
product or service as he or she narrates the shows.
As with the ad types mentioned before, keep these
short and infrequent. And follow this advice: Don’t
shill. If you are going to have the host talk about
how wonderful a product or service really is, it’s a
good idea to make sure that (s)he’s actually a fan of
the product. No one likes a liar. Have the advertiser
send samples of the product to you before the
endorsements run.
Here are some things to keep in mind as you plan for
endorsements:

They are easy to add. Since they’re not pre-
produced commercials, endorsements are sim-
ply read by the host. No muss. No fuss.

But they are hard to take out. Once they are in
a show, they are there for the life of that episode.
Remember that people can (and do) download
archived episodes, so anything your host says
on an episode is there for posterity. 
You could probably get very creative and use
some auto-insertion technology to combat
this fact. As we said previously, we haven’t
seen this work well in practice, but radio has it
down to a fine art. If you construct your show
properly, you may be able to insert endorse-
ments in such a way that they sound live. If
you are able to get that working, let us know
for future updates to the book.

Your listeners trust you. Let them know when
you are being compensated for singing a com-
pany’s praises. Hopefully, it’s a company that
you’re happy to endorse. But even so, your audi-
ence needs to know when you’re fulfilling a
financial obligation, versus just letting them
know about something you’re excited about.
Site takeovers
Here’s where your podcast has (for the moment) an
advantage over radio and television programs. For
most podcasts and many podcast listeners or view-
ers, the accompanying Web site for the podcast is an
integral part of the enjoyment of the show. People
visit the Web site to access past shows, comment on
an episode, or interact with other listeners. 
Mainstream media has figured this out. Most
of the popular television programs and syndi-
cated radio shows also have well-designed
companion Web sites. However, podcasters
still have the advantage here; we’re actually
using the Internet and a computer (in almost
all cases) to distribute the files to our audi-
ence. In other words, we’ve already got them
thinking Internet from the beginning.
Giving your advertiser(s) a visible presence on your
Web site can be beneficial. In the strictest sense, a
takeover means that all of the ad units on a Web
page (or an entire Web site) are owned by a single
advertiser. The large movie houses will run these
sorts of ads on large portals like Yahoo! when
launching an expected blockbuster. Podcasters can
offer their advertisers something similar. Running
visual ads on your Web site ties in and reinforces
the ad message the audience heard, strengthening
the value of the ad impression.
The nuances of designing a Web site that is ready to
successfully run banner ads is too complex for discus-
sion in this book. We suggest delving into AdWords For
Dummies and Web Marketing For Dummies, or other
relevant texts for the juicy details.
Creating an Insertion Order
Before anyone will write you a check for ads running
on your podcast, they’re going to want to know
exactly how you plan on spending their money.
While you may be able to get away with a handshake
deal, most serious advertisers will expect an inser-
tion order.

Note that this is just a sample. There may be addi-

or changes you need to make to have this approach
fit with your show’s offerings. Make it happen!
Handling Listener Complaints
Not surprisingly, not everyone will be happy when
you start running ads on your program. Even if you
start a brand-new podcast and immediately run ads,
you are going to get complaints. Hey, such is the
nature of the beast. How you respond to those com-
plaints determines their impact on your show. 
Here are a few tips for dealing with complaints from
listeners:

Don’t respond. You can’t make everyone happy
all the time. Some complaints — such as “I hate
ads. You should stop.” — don’t really warrant 
a response. You aren’t going to convince the 
complainer that ads are acceptable to you (after
all, isn’t that obvious?), and you aren’t likely to 
be swayed to that person’s side of the issue,
either — not without some better arguments.

Don’t knee-jerk. A single complaint doesn’t nec-
essarily mean you should drop everything and
implement the “suggestion” offered by the com-
plainer. People are motivated by their own inter-
ests, and you must weigh their interests against
what goals you have set for the show. If you
thought long and hard about adding advertise-
ments, you probably should put the same
amount of thought into making any changes
from a single negative comment. 

Listen and adapt. But if the feedback from the
listener is more specific, or you are getting a sig-
nificant amount of complaints, analyze what the
issues are. Maybe the ads don’t fit your the
demographics of your audience. Maybe you’ve
put in too many. Tweaking your plan as you
move forward isn’t a crime. In fact, it’s a really
good idea.
An insertion order, or IO, details when ads will run,
where they will be visible or audible, and the size or
length of the ads. The IO also spells out the terms of
the agreement, such as when payment is to be
expected and any sort of performance guarantees
built into the agreement. Unless you are very com-
fortable with your metrics and your ability to
deliver, we suggest you stay away from performance
guarantees, at least for the initial ad run with a
client. 
Rather than blather on about the intricacies of IOs,
it’s probably simplest if we just show you one in
Figure 47-1. (See? It looks nothing like a shoehorn.)

Does This Make You “Commercial”?
385

Always be honest and open. Transparency, the
act of keeping nothing hidden, is always a good
idea. If you’ve made a mistake with an ad, or
something has gone horribly wrong due to your
running an ad in your show, ’fess up. We don’t
always make the best decisions in life, and mis-
takes in advertising are common. It’s okay to run
a special piece on your show that apologizes or
explains what has happened. Trust us, your
audience will love you for it.
Does This Make You
“Commercial”?
In a word, probably. We’d give you a more solid
answer if we could agree on one. So instead of fighting
amongst ourselves, we’ll cop out and run the standard
WE ARE NOT LAWYERS disclaimer and ask that you
seek counsel before making decisions that might
impact your legality. These issues might include

Invalidating your ability to run some Creative
Commons material on your show

Having an impact on a nonprofit designation

Tax and revenue-reporting considerations

Personal liability issues
And that’s just a quick list from us non-lawyer types.
We’re betting that a good intellectual-property attor-
ney can come up with all sorts of things we haven’t
thought of.
One final note, to those who read all the way through
this practice and are seething at our suggestions for
commercializing a podcast: Not every podcaster is
interested in creating a viable commercial entity.
We’ve said as much, and stand by that statement.
But many are interested — and you were warned
early on that this is the case. Hopefully other parts of
this book work better for you. Bottom line: We figure
you’re in podcasting to enjoy it, so enjoy it your way!


Part VIII
Reengineering Your
Podcast

Podfade Prevention 
P
odcasting For Dummies gave co-author Tee Morris the closest expe-
rience ever to what it must be like to be the obsessive-compulsive
TV detective Adrian Monk. As star Tony Shaloub says (with all
the vulnerability he can muster), “It’s a gift . . . and a curse.”
What is? Well, for one thing, all that validation. Tee had been a writer of
fiction for years, but while writing under the For Dummies brand, he
wound up invited to all the right parties, hobnobbing with the stars,
getting the “A-List” treatment. . . . That was the “gift.”
The “curse” came when — less than a month after the book’s initial
release — the podcasts featured in the book started disappearing, one
after another. What was going on? Because podcasting was still a new
medium, no one really considered the possibilities of a podcast ending, for
whatever reason. Perhaps it was the same assumption behind a blog —
you never think about a show calling it quits or reaching a conclusion.
Then the term was coined by Scott Fletcher of Podcheck Review:
podfading.
As easily as it can happen to you, it can also be prevented.
Factors That Contribute to Podfading
Podfading is the community’s scarlet letter to podcasts that launched out
of the box strong only to scale back production values around the tenth
show, then change posting frequency, and then finally stop. In much the
same manner as a Roman candle, a podcast makes a sudden, bright
impression only to disappear. Podfading is easily preventable, but before
coming up with the solutions, it’s a good idea to diagnose the problem.
What causes podfading?

into a podcast should be in sync with the podcast’s
production demands. When the podcast’s demands
extend beyond your own limits, it can lead to
podfading.
Personal matters
A top-rated iTunes show, The Transmission (http://
hawaiiup.com/lost), a Lost podcast based out of
Hawaii, closed up shop unexpectedly in 2006. Show
hosts Ryan and Jen Ozawa found that the demands
of producing a weekly show (sporting a listenership
of over 15,000) — along with the financial demands of
providing sufficient bandwidth — took up too much
time and energy when coupled with their daily lives.
Whether the problem is the blurring of the lines
between reality and podcasting, an unexpected
change at home, the sudden disruption of sickness,
death, or the double-edged sword of success, podfad-
ing can occur if your heart just isn’t in it anymore.
The Honeymooners Syndrome
Podfading tends to make many in the podosphere
sneer, “Those podfaders just couldn’t cut it!” (No
lie — such aspersions have come from both pod-
casters and listeners!) Here at Expert Podcasting
Practices For Dummies, we’re of the mindset to
accept that life happens. It is sadder still the loss of
content (no matter what the show is) on account of
someone’s honest life decision.
That empathy, however, doesn’t extend to those
podcasters who get caught up in the Honeymooners
Syndrome.
What is that, you ask? Hearken back to the days of
early TV, when Honeymooners stars Jackie Gleason
and Art Carney would come across a scheme that
offered to set them up in the lap of luxury. “Norton,”
Ralph would say, a smile beaming brightly on his face,
“I’m telling you, this plan can’t miss.” Inevitably, it did.
The same thing happens to podcasters who get
into this medium with one objective: big money.
Oh, the occasional wild success story is there, sure,
Time
Perhaps the leading cause of podfading is the time
people invest in their podcasts. It gets to be too
much; a lot of us can empathize with the podfaders.
Friends ask Tee, “You’re writing, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got a day job, you travel for both, and you
have four podcasts you produce. How do you do
it?!” His usual answer is, “I don’t know, but when you
figure it out, tell me how!”
If you’ve got a lot of energy, or your muse refuses to
let you sleep, or you’re a master at time manage-
ment (hmm . . . a lot of us had better strike that last
one!), then you have a lot of what you need to pod-
cast. Equally important is getting a handle on the
value of time and a realistic estimate of the demands
when you’re creating a podcast. Earlier in this book,
we discuss the value of producing five (or more)
episodes for a podcast. That experience will quickly
give you an idea of exactly how much time your pod-
cast will demand of you.
Effort
Some podcasts are simply a host or a group of hosts
kicking back and enjoying a good chat over the state
of the world . . . or the contents of their fridge. With
the Weekly Anime Review podcast, Aaron sits back
and provides commentary on the world of anime.
With Two Girls and a Podcast, Chris and Eliza link up
via Skype and talk about whatever is striking their
fancy that particular week. Production is kept to the
bare-bones minimum.
When it comes to podcasts like Variant Frequencies,
Shadow Falls, Stranger Things, or Silent Universe,
the production demands increase exponentially.
Organizing the vocal talent. Efficient post-production
work. Wrestling with bandwidth issues. Keeping up
with these demands — and keeping the content free
to the public — can be extremely taxing. 
The earlier-mentioned podcasts are still podcasting,
but only because their creators are willing to clock
in the extra time and keep the production quality
and posting frequency consistent. The effort you put

Reconnecting with Your Passion
391
but podcasting is hardly a get-rich-quick vehicle.
What it really amounts to is a long-term investment of
time and resources that may (or may not) pay off
down the road. When you podcast, your first priority
should be the content — and you have to back up
that content with a desire and passion to produce it
on a regular basis. If your first priority is landing the
big sponsors, quitting your day job, and making a
mint in podcasting, then you’re not podcasting for
the right reasons, and you’re likelier to podfade.
Taking a Break
Now that you have a good idea of what can cause a
podfade to occur, how do you keep this fate from
befalling a project that has come to mean so much to
listeners?
There is something to be said about stepping away
from a podcast for a moment or two, now and then,
just to catch your breath.
In many cases, a break is needed because demands
of real life are getting too intense. Tee’s immediate
schedule (while writing this practice) was a case in
point. In addition to writing, he had several seminar
and teaching commitments to attend to — and all
this while, still doing a weekly podcast.
But practicality prevailed: Tee’s podcast announced
that all his present time commitments left no realis-
tic room to record. He stepped back to take care
of the other business, and his podcast went dark for
two weeks. Upon returning, he found the listeners
were there, glad to hear the story return with a new
drive and determination. 
The break (while maybe not a relaxing one) was nec-
essary to the life of the show. Tee had to wait until
his schedule lightened up before he could produce
episodes at his personal quality level.
Regardless of whether the break you take is due to
your day job, family commitments, a change in your
life’s routine, or just a need to get control of the
podcast (instead of the podcast controlling you),
what’s important here is to let your listeners know.
If there’s a break coming up in the show posting’s
frequency, your listeners will stay with you so long
as you keep the lines of communications open.
Produce a five-minute quickcast that lets people
know what’s going on; it may surprise you just how
understanding your audience will be. Let the listen-
ers know how long a break you’re taking; if you feel
comfortable about letting them know why, do that.
From there, you can step away from your podcast’s
schedule with a clear conscience. It beats a burnout
followed by a podfade.
Reconnecting with Your Passion
Sometimes, Jack Bauer needs a break between his
bad days of saving the world. Cylons probably need
to recharge their batteries from time to time. It’s no
surprise that actors, writers, and production crews
need to take a break during the summer (or, in the
case of The Sopranos cast, for a majority of the
year!) so they can remain fresh with the characters
and situations they face. Podcasters need breaks,
too. One of the reasons a podcast may podfade is
the podcaster’s loss of passion for what he or she is
podcasting about. After six months of podcasting on
a weekly or a bi-monthly schedule, your message
could sound tired. 
Why you may need to go on hiatus
There are a variety of natural reasons to take a
break simply to give yourself some downtime, and
here are a few to consider:

The holidays. Whichever holidays take priority
in your life definitely should provide you a
respite from your podcasting schedule. Between
Thanksgiving and Christmas, the time just isn’t
there to podcast. Usually, after the confetti is
cleared from the New Year’s celebrations, the
time is right, and podcasters are ready (pretty
anxious, in fact) to get back to it.

Practice 48: Podfade Prevention
392
The listeners understood.
Because the subscribers were part of the experi-
ence, hearing regular discussion on how Joe was
doing, they understood that this was coming. It
was a time of mourning; and for the FarPoint
Media crew, it was a necessity to pay respect to
“their fallen ninja.”
Regardless of health issues, the important thing
here is that both Skepticality and FarPoint Media
communicated to their audience that there would be
a break. The break was unexpected and unplanned
in both situations, but audiences knew what was up
and stayed subscribed.
Communication, in both these situations, kept the
audience in the loop and kept them subscribed.
Provided you take a moment to let people know
what is happening, your subscribers will understand
and won’t desert you.
Along with your podcast, take advantage of
your blog. Sure, the blog is a convenient place
for your show notes, but you can also use it
for updates in personal or health matters that
affect your podcast’s production schedule.
How personal the info gets — and whatever
details you choose to reveal on the blog — is
completely up to you, but remember: Your
blog is a means of keeping your listenership
informed and in the loop on the status of your
podcast and its crew.
What to do during your break 
The break taken here should be a moment for you
and your crew (or just you, if you’re working solo) to
step away from the recording, the editing, and the
podcast as a whole. This is the downtime that lets
you focus on nothing else but the passion behind
your podcast. If your podcast is about gardening,
clock in some time in the herb garden. If your pod-
cast is about writing, write. If your podcast is about
underwater basket-weaving, go for a swim. Whatever
you do, invest some time into the passion you pod-
cast about.

The end of a season. Tee happily hosted the
Podcasting For Dummies Companion Podcast until
Episode #20 when he announced it was time for
a break. As Tee signed off, he assured everyone
that there would be a new season of the podcast
as soon as the new book was completed. What
could be a more natural (and true) explanation?
The number of episodes that make up a sea-
son varies from podcast to podcast. It all
depends on how often you’re podcasting and
what feels right for you. Many podcasts follow
a network-television model: A season lasts for
about 20 to 25 episodes.

Health issues. Skepticality (www.skepticality.
com) was one of the original trailblazers of pod-
casting, bringing an unabashed, critical look at
politics, religion, consumerism, and the world.
Its hosts Derek Colanduno and Swoopy inspired
others to voice their viewpoints (such as Truth
Seekers at http://audioaddict.libsyn.com
and George Hrab’s GeoLogic Podcast at http://
geologicpodcast.net), caught the attention
of Business Week and even Apple’s Steve Jobs,
and the show was named “the Official Podcast 
of Skeptic Magazine.”
These accomplishments are nothing less than
inspiring, especially considering the long break
the hosts took unexpectedly in September 2005
when Derek suffered a kind of aneurism that sent
him into a coma. Swoopy made an announce-
ment on Skepticality about Derek’s condition,
and then the show went dark for close to a year.
The podcast launched again once Derek deemed
himself ready and able. Not only were the show’s
hosts ready to bring their views to the world,
but the listenership was ready to listen. 

A death in the family. On April 1, 2007, the
podosphere lost one of its own. Joe Murphy of
FarPoint Media (http://farpointmendia.net)
lost a battle with leiomyosarcoma, an extremely
aggressive form of cancer. When his death hap-
pened, the FarPoint crew with whom Joe worked
closest took several of their shows and repeated
past episodes — while Wingin’ It aired a tribute
show before going dark for a month.

It’s a Great Idea for a Podcast, but . . .
393
Another option for this downtime is stepping away
from this passion. Make a clean break and step away
from it completely. Stopping a passion cold-turkey
can actually shock you back into a renewed love for
what you talk about.
When you do something for nothing, it should be
something you look forward to doing. This applies
to the experts just as much as it applies to the rook-
ies or the casual podcaster who is merely exploring
the media as an audio hobby. If you don’t love what
you do, the podcast becomes a chore — and there’s
very little you can do to mask that ennui in your
delivery when the mic goes live.
Step away from the mic and take a sabbatical.
When you’re ready, make the return with a new-
found fire and heavy fanfare. Not only will your
loyal fans return, but you might even catch a few
new listeners, too.
It’s a Great Idea for a Podcast,
but . . .
“I feel thin . . . sort of stretched, like butter scraped
over too much bread.”
—Bilbo Baggins, in The Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Ring
When you read that, did you groan a bit because
you feel that way every day? (A forest of authorial
hands goes up.) If you tend to have a tough time
saying no to people, podcasting will only intensify
the need to say no now and then. 
Perhaps the idea you get for yet another podcast is
for a good cause, or perhaps you think of a show
that would be a roller-coaster ride for yourself and
your audience. However, instead of rushing into the
idea headfirst with blinders on, the best thing you
can do in developing this idea is to evaluate your
time commitments first: 

Is there room in your schedule for this Next Big
Thing in podcasting? 

Do you enough time available to host and pro-
duce and promote and maintain this podcast? 

If you do start this podcast, how will it affect the
other podcasts you’re currently running?
Yes, consider your other podcasts, ranging from the
five-minute quickcasts to the full hour-long produc-
tions. You may think one more podcast may not
have a profound effect on your other shows, but 
it will — because any time you spend on those
shows is time away from that particular new show.
In essence, it’s another commitment you will want 
to meet.
Consider your time before you agree to assist other
podcasters, as well. Nothing is as aggravating as
committing to helping out a podcast with some
audio, only to end up forced to later admit, “I can’t
do it.” Before agreeing to help out other podcasters
with audio, ask the following:

How much audio is needed?

When do you need it by?

Will you want it edited or just recorded, with all
editing and post-production handled elsewhere?

Will you need me in later episodes? Will you
need more audio later?
Supplying audio for other podcasts is a commitment
that should be honored, and there is no love lost if
you just say no. Timing is everything in both com-
edy and podcasting. If the time is right, throw your
hat into the ring and have fun. If you are swamped
and overcommitted, then concentrate on clearing
your desk. Otherwise, you will just continue to clear
your desk with no end in sight.
A final note on why saying no is a good thing: Get
away from the computer and enjoy life. Part of the
charm and appeal of podcasting is hearing about the

world will assuredly enjoy listening to you talk
about it.

so much living you can do from your computer.

caster, life experience is what makes shows fun and

New Hosts,
New Podcast?
P
odcasts can be a personality-driven enterprise. Good hosts forge a
connection with listeners — and have the personality, knowledge,
and charisma to keep the masses coming back for more. Hopefully,
you have just such a host at the helm of your program, whether it’s you
or somebody else. And yet, people move on and times change. Hosts go
elsewhere, whether it’s David Letterman moving from NBC to CBS or
your friend deciding to leave his more general videogame podcast to
focus solely on his love of small-leaping-Italian-plumber games (but only
the original work — those new games corrupted this message).
There are a lot of factors to consider at this point, including how a new
host affects both the podcast itself and the program’s listeners. You have
to decide what (if any) changes need to be made in the program itself,
and you need to decide who’s going to come on board to replace the
familiar voice at the mic. That person may, in turn, require more changes
in the program. With all these priorities flying around, you’ll need to get a
pen and paper to write all this down and make sure you keep everything
straight.
Heading Toward the Door
If you have a little lead time before you know a podcast host is going to be
moving on, it might be best to lay the groundwork for a graceful exit.
Audiences don’t like to be surprised, and losing a regular part of their regu-
lar podcast schedule can leave them a little cold. Take advantage of the
personalized nature of podcasts. You’re not broadcasting to society as a
whole — you’re narrowcasting to (hopefully a sizeable) segment of the
population, folks who are interested in what you’re talking about. Let them
know what’s going on, and they’ll appreciate it — it’s kinder to them than
just letting ’em download an entirely new program with new hosts one day
(they tend to wonder where their show went). Fans don’t always take
kindly to change, so if you’re transitioning from a program that already has
some popularity to something new, it’s good to give them a heads-up.

396
It also means keeping the focus of the podcast in
mind. In this example, that paper corporation is
going to remain the focus, no matter who the host
is. You’re going to keep the subject consistent from
story to story, from storyteller to storyteller.
Therefore you want to find somebody who can
deliver the podcast well, interact with whoever
appears on the podcast, and still stay out of the way
of the podcast’s focus.
If the podcast, however, is more personality-driven
(a television feature with a host who has a lot of
contacts in the field, for instance), you’re going to
have some trouble. That host is an integral part of
the show, and you’ll have to find somebody else
with that same sort of credibility to take over.
Nobody will buy your new videogaming podcast (for
example) if the host doesn’t know the difference
between a Commodore 64 and a Wii.
So you need somebody who’s at ease doing the
speaking and hosting duties that make a podcast
work. If interviews are going to be part of the show,
you need somebody who can interact naturally with
others. And that person (or those persons) will have
to make a regular commitment to hosting this pod-
cast. Infrequent episodes turn off the listeners; be
sure to find somebody who can do the job.
Taking a Step Back to 
Re-evaluate the Show
So now that you’ve located your new host (or
decided to soldier on with him or her), it’s time
to decide how the personality of the show has been
changed — and how the program must adapt to that
personality change. You may have to drop the ten-
minute monologue at the beginning of a podcast if
your new host can’t carry that off, or you might
want to play to the host’s strengths if he or she is a
naturally charismatic and friendly person. If the
Good, that is, if it can be done gracefully. If you’re
moving on due to “irreconcilable differences” with
folks who are still involved with the show, it’s best
to cut the cord immediately and move on with the
program before things get too bad. Continuing with
a podcast after it’s clear that things are going wrong
will only serve to annoy or turn off the listeners. If
there’s a quick and definite solution that can be
taken to solve the problem, take it. It’s hard to win
back listeners after they’ve been turned off.
We’d Like to Introduce to You . . .
So now that you need to find a replacement, where
do you start? It was probably hard enough to find
your first podcast host — and now you have to go
out and get somebody else. So what do you do? The
first step is to re-evaluate the nature of your podcast
and decide what needs to remain the focus of your
program:

Is this an informational podcast, or are you
focused more on entertainment? 

Should the host be from a certain region of the
country (or the world)?

Does the show thrive on the host’s personality
traits, or are you worried about how a new per-
sonality will carry the show?
For example, you wouldn’t necessarily try to put on a
podcast about your city’s happenings without having
your host reside in that city. How believable is some-
one going to sound talking about this weekend’s art
festival from hundreds of miles away over a Skype
line? Alternatively, if you’re producing a podcast that
represents your corporation’s activities around the
country (“Look at how our paper products improve
San Diego! Now we’ll take a look at notebook activi-
ties in the greater Chicagoland area . . .”), that locality
isn’t going to be as important.

Incorporating Changes to Your Show
397
podcast has a tight structure with well-defined seg-
ments, it can be an easier transition. If the podcast
is organized more loosely, you’ll find that you’ll have
to adapt more to the host’s personality.
Incorporating Changes 
to Your Show
After you’ve identified the changes necessary to
keep your podcast up and running, you have a cou-
ple of choices to make: Do you work the changes in
quickly, or do you allow them to evolve over time? 
You have to take into account both your audience
and your show at this point. Would your listeners tol-
erate a quick change? Would the show sound better
if you made the changes quickly or more slowly?
Again, if the podcast is well structured and doesn’t
depend on the host as much, you could probably
make changes relatively quickly. A personality-driven
podcast takes some creative thought and time to
make the switchover so the change doesn’t turn off
audiences. Give ’em some time to come around.
Above all, make sure that you hold your pod-
cast to the same high standards you’ve been
using up to this point. A change for the worse
is the road to an untimely podfade.

Change of Passion,
Change of Podcast?
L
ike most things that make their way to the Internet (remember the
dancing gerbils and all those e-mail forwards you still get, even
though they’ve been circulating since the beginning of time?), the
vast majority of podcasts are driven by passion. Whether it’s a love of
cooking or the need to rant for hours about their neighbors, podcasters
have a strong internal motivation to create their shows. They podcast
not only because they want to, but almost because they need to. That
makes these podcasts personal — almost intimate — and it’s a factor
that draws listeners in and keeps them coming back.
However, time moves on, things change, and podcasters may become
interested in something else. Given the fast pace and the intense informa-
tion saturation on the Internet, you can quickly get burnt out on doing a
podcast, even if it’s a topic you love talking about. It takes a lot of effort
to research, write, record, and produce a podcast on a regular basis, and
the schedule can be a little grueling. When you start wishing you could
spend your podcasting time doing . . . well, just about anything else, it
might be time to take a step back and see exactly why you’re producing
this program.
Performing an Annual Evaluation
So you’ve been creating your podcast for a while now, and it just doesn’t
have the same lure as it did before. Or you still want to create a podcast,
but you’re not sure about the subject matter anymore. It’s possible that
something else is influencing your decision, so you might want to start
looking at the reasons why. Once you know why you’re feeling the way
you do, you can look at how to change it.
Time
Taking the time to create a podcast can eat into other parts of your life,
and you may be having problems keeping everything balanced. Your day
job (unless podcasting is your day job, of course), your family, other
leisure activities (I NEED MY NEEDLEPOINT TIME!), and more can make

you feel a little stressed out or overcommitted. If the
podcast is taking too much time out of your life, it’s
time to make a change.
It may not be time to chuck the whole thing, though.
Consider ways to reduce your time commitment to
the show, and you may find yourself feeling a little
better about it. Try getting some help with creating
the show, or shorten the actual time of the show.
Once you get a little more time to yourself, you could
find you have a little more energy for the show.
Effort
Depending on what you include in your podcast,
you may end up doing a lot more than just turning
on the mic and letting your mind run free. If you
have to keep up to date on all the current happen-
ings in a subject (from technology to cars to movies
to the latest in postage-stamp innovations), it can
mean doing a lot of show preparation, and that can
be a little exhausting. Fatigue doesn’t just have to be
physical — you could be experiencing a classic case
of burnout.
Maybe a little vacation is in order. You don’t see new
episodes of your favorite television shows every
week, do you? Taking some time to rest, rejuvenate,
and re-evaluate could be just what you need. It
could also mean that you’re ready to leave the pod-
cast behind and move on to something else. Before
you do that, though, it couldn’t hurt to take a little
break. After you’ve put it aside for a bit, you’ll have
more perspective on what you want to do.
New subject matter
Sure, your half-hour treatises on funny-car racing
pleased both you and your listeners. Yet, one day,
you realize that Formula One is starting to catch
your attention. Sure, it’s a little different from
what you’re used to, and it’s not something you’ve
focused on before. Still, more and more, you realize
you have vital thoughts and opinions on the state of
F1, and you must share these with the world. Funny
cars are great and all, but you’re moving onto a
global stage now.
As mentioned in the introduction to this practice,
passions can change, evolve, or move on. Because
you’re most likely the boss of your own podcast, you
have license to explore different subjects and mat-
ters. It may mean starting a new program in addition
to your current podcast, expanding your current
show to include your new interest — or even discon-
tinuing your current program and starting a new one,
with new theme music, scripts, and the like. This can
be a big step, so it might be worth spending some
time considering your new direction. As with
burnout, you may find that taking a little time out
could bring you back to where you want to be. It may
also lead you to an entirely new show. 
Keep in mind, however, that you’ve already estab-
lished an agreement or relationship of sorts with
your audience. They’ve come to expect a certain
type of program from you, and drastic changes may
have a major impact on your listenership. Be ready
to absorb some major changes from them as they
absorb some major changes from you.
Don’t be afraid to explore a new show — it’s
not like you have to start canceling other pro-
grams or make room on the evening lineup.
Remember, only time and bandwidth can
limit what programs you want to produce.
Who’s Counting on You?
The vast majority of podcasts are individual efforts,
but that doesn’t necessarily mean that your show is
made in a vacuum. You should take into account
some folks when making your decision to switch
things around and change from (say) a music podcast
to a serious economic roundtable program (time to
put that degree to work, we suppose).
Podcasting co-workers
If you do work with other people on your podcast,
you should definitely consult with them before mak-
ing any major programming changes. After all, they
share your passion for the current show, and they
may not be as ready as you are to make a transition.

Practice 50: Change of Passion, Change of Podcast?
400
be considered. If you’re producing your show mainly
for a small group of fans you know personally, they’ll
probably understand if you choose to move on.
However, you may have already developed a large
and loyal following with your podcast (who knew
Amish quilts would be so popular on the Internet?),
and a change in focus for your podcast could turn
off some of your listeners. If it’s just a slight switch
in subject matter, you can probably ride out the
change with no problem.
Don’t expect an audience to follow you through a
major transition, though. If you want to keep your
audience, look at what they want, and take that into
consideration when you make your switch. If you’re
the only one out there doing a podcast on your sub-
ject, you could be leaving a big hole to fill. That’s not
to say that you should feel obligated to pursue your
podcast far past the point of caring about doing it.
It’s your life, after all. But if you’re going to be leav-
ing said large hole, consider turning over the show
to somebody else who can keep it going. Your audi-
ence may miss you, but the show will still be there.
Time for an Overhaul
So suppose, after taking all the factors mentioned
here into consideration, you’ve decided to cast your
former podcast aside and jump headlong into a new
project. The good news is that you’re already an
experienced podcaster, so you won’t have as much
trouble starting your show over again. The bad
news is that you’re basically starting your show
over again. Even with your experience, making a
major change like this means that you’re essentially
creating a new show from scratch, and you have to
go through all the work of plotting, planning, record-
ing, and promoting one more time. Have fun!
Changing the podcast itself
If you produced your old podcast for a long time,
you probably became pretty set in your ways. You
had a regular schedule of preparation and recording,
and you knew what program segments went where.
With a new podcast, all that changes. It doesn’t
Talk with them seriously about why you want to
make this change. It might be time to start your
own different podcast and let them take over the
current project.
Advertisers
While this probably isn’t a concern for most pod-
casts out there, you do have to consider the wishes
of anybody who provides support to your podcast,
whether it’s a financial or barter (trade) arrange-
ment. They bought into your podcast in some fash-
ion because they wanted to reach your audience. If a
major programming shift takes place, your program
might not be reaching that same audience. A local
auto shop probably won’t want to spend any money
on your new podcast Bicycling Away. It’s not that
you’re producing a bad podcast — you’re no longer
speaking to its target audience. If you’re comfortable
moving on without the benefit of that support, then
you’re ready to go.
Don’t forget to take into account any legal
agreements or contracts you may have
entered into with those advertisers. If you have
any of those things lying around, it’s definitely
in your best interest to fully complete the
terms of those contracts before moving on.
Nobody needs too many lawyers in their lives.
Your boss and company
If you’re podcasting for your boss or your company,
you’re not the only one responsible for the show.
This program represents the interests and image of
your business, and therefore it definitely has a say in
what happens with the podcast. Your new program
could either attract or repel potential customers, so
you need to run any changes by your company to
make sure the higher-ups are good with it. It may 
be your show, but ultimately the company is paying
the bills.
Listeners
They’re mentioned last in this section, but the 
needs and attitudes of your listeners should also 

Drawing a New Crowd

mean you have to completely overhaul your style,
but you’re dealing with new subject matter now —
and your programming habits might need to change
in a way that better serves the subject matter. For
example, if your podcast is focused more on current
events, you might have to make a short program
more often than you did before. If your new podcast
is longer, you could possibly cut back on your pro-
duction schedule.
Back to square one
You’re also not married to the same theme music,
format, or anything having to deal with the last
show you produced. It can be hard to do, but you
can take this opportunity to totally reimagine the
show you put together and try new and different
things. You first started podcasting because it was a
wide-open field for you to express what you wanted
to, right? It may be difficult to snap out of your old
habits, but now is the perfect opportunity to make
your new podcast different from your last one. The
change of topic (and maybe pace) could keep you
from getting burned out as easily, as well.
Take a look at this checklist and make sure you know
what you’re getting into when you’re starting over:

New show title

New theme music and sound effects

New show length

New production schedule

New entries in podcast directories and networks
Drawing a New Crowd
Now that you have got your program ready to go,
it’s probably a good idea to re-read this entire book.
Just bend the corner of this page and get back to it
when you’re finished.
All right, maybe you don’t need to subject yourself
to that again. But a refresher might help. Remember
that starting from scratch means that you have to
repeat a lot of the steps you’d already gone through
with your last podcast. And there’s really nothing
that you should skip simply because you’ve done it
before with your other show. You’re tackling a new
project now, and it’s likely that the listeners will be a
different crowd. You have to lure them in with your
new show just the way you did with your old one.
Even if you’re using the same Web site and feed, you
need to entice the audience to stick around.
Targeting a new audience
You probably have an idea of the people who would
listen to your new podcast, if only because they
share your passion for the subject. So you already
have an idea of where they go for information and
entertainment — probably the same places you do.
Still, get out there and put your search engine
through the paces. Find all the possible locations
online (and offline, if possible) that can give you a
look at what your potential audience is doing and
what they want to listen to. This is basic market
research, but it certainly gives you some places to
spread the word about your show and help you
know what people want to listen to. Refer to the
practices in Part V for a refresher course on building
your new audience.
Mixing the old and the new
If you didn’t make a drastic transition in podcasting
focus (we suppose it’s possible your punk-rock com-
patriots might share your newfound interest in
locally produced polka music), you could conceiv-
ably take members of your old audience with you.
Don’t be afraid to tell your old listeners about your
new endeavors. They may follow you for your new
subject matter, and they may follow you just because
they enjoy the programs you’ve put together in the
past and they want to see what you’re up to now.
Don’t count on a mass exodus to your new program,
but do encourage your audience to at least give you
a shot. It’s not like they have to pay an extra cable
bill to check out your new creation.

The Hard Podfade
P
odfading, whether you like it or not, is something to consider when
you launch a podcast. It may seem a bit sad to think about the end
when you’re caught up in the excitement of launching a podcast —
and even reaching milestones like Episode #100 — but it is a reality. So
far, you have been keeping the fires burning in your podcast studio. You
have focused on ways of keeping the interests and the passions of your
podcast running, ranging from reconnecting with your podcast’s subject
matter to stepping away from the production for a little perspective.
There are situations, however, where the only option is to sweep the
floors, put the chairs on the top of the tables, turn off the lights, and
lock up the studio. How to say goodbye is up to you. 
No Announcement, No More Show
Perhaps the most common kind of podfade is anything but a fade; it’s
more like a vanishing. The feed begins promisingly enough with a few
shows, be it three episodes or even five, and then the show suddenly
stops in its posting.
Shows like this are easy to find on iTunes, provided the podcasts are still
on their host’s server. A good indication of the sudden podfade is to
look at the time stamps displayed in the podcast’s listing. The existing
episodes usually have a consistent timing in their schedule early on, sud-
denly coming to an abrupt stop. The next step in confirming a podcast’s
demise is to check the podcast’s host site or blog. Find out whether any-
one is still posting there; and if they are, search for any relevant posts
from the show’s host or hosts. If all appears quiet, it would not be out of
line to drop a friendly e-mail asking whether the show has, in fact, ceased
production. Provided the tone of your e-mail is not confrontational and
more out of concern than demanding, “Where is my next episode?!”, you
may receive a pleasant, cordial reply explaining either that the show has
gone on hiatus — or that the podcast has, in fact, closed its doors. Such
was the case for Kiki Anika, a voice that charmed writers everywhere with
her sassy Australian accent and perspectives on writing romance. Her
51
Practice

Good Night, and Good Luck
403
podcast, The Kissy Bits, steadily climbed in its listen-
ership until episodes came to an abrupt halt in
December 2006. At first, it was assumed the holidays
had claimed all her free time; but as 2007 continued
on without her, e-mails asking when The Kissy Bits
would return began arriving in her mailbox. Sadly,
encouragement from all parts of the world failed to
ignite the interest for an Aussie comeback. Still, her
Web site (www.kikianika.com, shown in Figure
51-1) reassured her loyal listeners that while her
podcasting was tabled for the time-being, her writing
was gaining momentum.
• Figure 51-1: Romance author Kiki Anika came on to the
podosphere strong, but a budding writing
career detoured her podcasting interests,
bringing an end to The Kissy Bits.
Heartbreaking as it was to hear that Kiki would not
return with her romance writing podcast, the good
news was that the plucky Australian hostess was
heading in the right direction with her writing and
still only an e-mail away. Remember, when writing to
podcast hosts, keep queries brief and (most impor-
tant) positive. If you receive no reply at all or get the
bad news of “no more podcast,” shut down the feed
and remember the good times while they lasted.
Good Night, and Good Luck
Some shows reluctantly look at the time and 
effort invested in the podcast, and after a lot of re-
evaluation, the producers (who, in most cases, are
also the hosts, editors, writers, and directors) try to
streamline the production. Following the pruning of
the show’s demands, the ugly truth continues to
raise its ugly head: It’s time to call it quits.
If you end up at this point, the decision to fold the
tents does not make you a bad podcaster — but
what you do at this stage of your podcast says a lot
about you to your listeners, as well as about the way
you regard them as a community. The hard podfade,
as mentioned in the previous section, sends out a
message of “Well, I really don’t care . . .” to a listener-
ship. Regardless if your podcast-generated listener-
ship is an audience of 2 or 200, your audience
deserves more than just the cold shoulder of silence.
Because our stock in trade here is expert podcasting
practices, it’s worth noting that one of those is the
professional approach to podfading — again, some-
thing many podcasters never really consider at the
beginning of their projects: To communicate with
your listeners and let them know that your podcast
is heading off into the sunset, much in the same way
that Indy, his dad, Sallah, and Dr. Marcus did at the
end of Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Some-
thing clear, final, and upbeat, also known as . . . 
The farewell episode
Many podcasters believe the first episode to be the
toughest. They figure it sounds awkward and comes
across as a touch tense and a bit jittery. New ven-
tures often do. But if you think the premiere episode
is difficult, just wait until you tackle the last one.

Practice 51: The Hard Podfade


Other shows of similar interest. When people
interested in podcasting tell us “I have an idea
for a podcast — but it’s been done before . . . “
we usually reply with, “So? This is your podcast
and your perspective.” If Face the Nation were to
shut down its podcast, other podcasters (and
listeners) would find political commentary to fill
the void left behind. But give ’em a break: When
you believe that the podcast you are recording is
your last one, listeners will probably begin to
wonder, “Great, so what do I listen to now?!”
Why not offer a few recommendations? 
Podcasters are also podcatchers as well; we lis-
ten to podcasts that either go with or against
our grain. As George Hrab of The GeoLogic
Podcast stated in one of his episodes, “It’s always
a good idea to know what the other side is say-
ing.” Giving your audience some tips for recom-
mended listening not only fills the void, but is
also a gesture of respect; they’ll appreciate that
touch. It says, in effect, “Okay, so maybe I’m not
doing this anymore, but I like what these other
folks are saying, or at least find it important or
useful, so why not give them a try?”
Okay, this may seem obvious, but before you
recommend other shows, it behooves you to
listen to a few of their episodes beforehand.
Simply searching through a category and say-
ing “Yeah, give this show a listen . . .” is a bit
reckless; some podcasts are not always listed
in the appropriate category or may change
their focus without making a note of the
change in the show description. While you
don’t have to become a regular listener to
anybody’s podcast, it wouldn’t be a bad idea
to listen to two or three episodes of whichever
unknown podcast you’re thinking of recom-
mending, just to make certain that the
description matches the actual podcast —
and that it’s actually something you feel
comfortable recommending. If you know what
the podcast is all about, then your sincere rec-
ommendation leaves a good impression on
your community.
When recording the last episode, consider how you
sound. Do you sound elated or exhausted? Distracted
or depressed? Whimsical or whiny? This is the last-
ing, final impression — at least to this audience —
that you are leaving in the place of your show. How
do you want to be remembered by your listeners? It
may come as a shock to you when your final podcast
is the topic of much debate, and people talk that
episode up as they did the final episode of Quantum
Leap. Was it a good way to wrap things up? Did listen-
ers get a real reason as to why the podcast has come
to a close? What do they listen to now?
So here are some points to hit in your farewell
episode that your listeners will appreciate:

The reason why this is the last episode.
Ultimately, it’s no one’s business other than
yours, true — but depending on the nature of
the podcast and the rapport you’ve built over a
season (or two) with your listenership, it’s good
manners to explain to your listenership exactly
why your microphone is going dark. How per-
sonal you make those reasons is strictly up to
you and your own boundaries. Even if it’s “I sim-
ply don’t have the time,” you may be surprised
to find that even such a humble reason is
enough for your listener base. Offering that kind
of simple honesty and candor may inspire one of
your listeners to pick up the proverbial podcast-
ing torch and keep the show rolling along with-
out you, provided you’re comfortable with that
notion and see your podcast more as a service
than as a property. 
By giving your reasons behind the end of
your production, you also give audience
members a clear idea of what’s behind the
decision, reassure them that their attention
matters to you, and maybe alleviate any possi-
ble conspiracy theories about your podcast’s
close. (“It was the space aliens, man. They’re
trying to take over the podosphere.”)


Thank your audience for listening. Three words
that, even though you hear them again and
again, carry so much weight: “Thank you for lis-
tening.” (Okay, three words and a preposition!)
No one is compelled or forced to listen to your
podcast, and acknowledging that with a simple
“Thanks . . .” — especially at the end — lets your
listeners know how much you appreciate the
time they invested in you and how much fun
they’ve made this ride of yours through the
podosphere. 
And don’t make the thank-you a throwaway.
Mean it. When you think about it, the folks sub-
scribing to your podcast got there in various
ways — from the recommendation of other pod-
casters, listener word-of-mouth, or a search for
podcasting topics and keywords. Your commu-
nity is always there, hanging on your every post.
They don’t have to stick it out with you, but they
do. If you’re shutting things down, your listener-
ship deserves a binary High Five (as created by
the hosts of Technorama) and a sincere thank
you for being there.
The farewell episode is also a popular finale for pod-
casters who know their productions have a planned
end in sight. J.C. Hutchins (of the widely popular
potboiler thriller 7th Son) creates, at the end of each
complete book, a Fan Appreciation or a Listener
Feedback show — which includes everything from
voice mail to listener-inspired fiction, as well as a
heartfelt thank you and stay tuned from Hutchins
himself.
The blog-post farewell
A number of podcasters, after laboring over the
decision to continue a podcast, draft a letter of res-
ignation to their audience, go back and polish it up,
and then finally log on to their podcast’s host blog
and make the post.
For that matter, why not record something? For
some podcasts, that’s too emotional a task. You’ve
invested time, energy, and personal resources into
your show, and now you’re coming on pod to say,
“It’s time for me to say goodbye.” This may sound a
bit sappy, but it’s also true: Goodbye is not always
easy. What makes a blog announcement “easier”
(and if we could make the quotes bigger around that
without wrecking the typography of this book, we
would) is being able to get your thoughts, decisions,
and opinions out to your listenership without actu-
ally hearing yourself saying, “This is it.” The silent
word on-screen has its advantages. It may not seem
like a big deal, but trust us — it is.
The farewell on the blog also gives you the option of
keeping in touch with your core group of listeners.
In this farewell post, you can announce that while
the podcast is closing shop, the blog will remain
open for business. Even after some podcasts have
concluded their runs, their accompanying blogs still
have recent posts, updates, and links of interest —
continuing the community that the show built.

Now that you’ve closed shop, your audio equipment

PodCamps and podcast conventions: PodCamps
(http://podcamp.org) are held across the
United States and around the world. At these
events, podcasters — and people interested in
podcasting — gather together and participate in
panel discussions and hands-on workshops.
There is also a great deal of networking — and
part of that networking includes a bit of barter-
ing and bargaining for used equipment, whether
it’s face-to-face selling or an exchange of leads to
the Web sites with the best deals. 
Note, however, that some podcamps discourage
the selling and marketing of merchandise. If that
is the case, look into podcast conventions like
the Podcast and New Media Expo (http://
newmediaexpo.com, shown in Figure 51-2) and
podcasting tracks at science fiction conventions
(such as Dragon*Con and Balticon). At these
events, bartering and bargaining abound; and
there are plenty of good deals to take advantage
of. You can also pre-arrange transactions if you
have a rapport with another podcaster (or lis-
tener-wanting-to-podcast) over Skype: You can set
up times, places, and prices before you meet to do
the deal. A terrific advantage of conducting busi-
ness in this manner is face-to-face transaction.
Instead of a nondescript e-mail and profile on
eBay, you have a contact (albeit someone you
probably just met!) and that person-to-person rela-
tionship makes commerce a lot easier. (And why
not? It used to be the only way to buy and sell.)

Online discussion groups and forums: Swap
meets take place 24-7 online, outside of eBay.
Perhaps these transactions are missing the
instant gratification and quick purchases with
Visa or MasterCard, but these communities are
the equivalent of small towns: Everyone knows
everyone and shares everything from gossip to
the latest news in the podosphere. 
Online discussion groups like Yahoo! Podcasters
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/
podcasters/) are well-established communities,
exchange of the equipment a lot easier and more
convenient for the buyer.
If manuals have gone missing, consider looking
online at the manufacturer’s Web site. User manuals
may be available online for download and easy
printing at home.
Selling your sound supply
So where is a good place to offer up equipment for
sale, and what are the pros and cons in selling your
rigs? It’s not so easy to slap a red tag on your stuff
(and you might devalue the mic if a big ol’ sticker is
slapped across it!) and then hold a sale. Consider
your possibilities, what makes the sale as conven-
ient and stress-free as possible?

eBay: Yes, the absolute answer to getting rid of
stuff you don’t want in your house anymore,
the eBay online auction site is a good place to
unload your podcasting rigs. Granted, this
approach may involve a little more work on your
part. (To find out how you can economize this
investment of time, maximize the potential of
reselling your audio equipment, and make the
most from your sale, pick up eBay For Dummies,
or eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies,
both by Marsha Collier [Wiley]). Remember:
You can reach a global audience of would-be
podcasters and audio enthusiasts, all in the
market for something. True, what you’re selling
may not be “new” to you, but it is to the person
stopping by your eBay Merchant Page.
eBay has plenty of good security measures,
but unsavory, unscrupulous characters are still
lurking about. Before giving the okay on a
purchase or even setting up a store for your-
self, check all the policies of eBay (and scruti-
nize those aforementioned For Dummies
books) to find out what you may need to do if
some shady transaction crops up (be it a delay
in payment, a bounced check, and the like)
and what you can do to defend yourself
against these problems.

welcoming new members into the fold and offer-

to know the community, ask either on or off the
list if anyone is interested in relieving you of used
equipment. This kind of transaction combines the
best of the eBay and face-to-face worlds: You
“know” the person you are directly dealing with.
• Figure 51-2: The Podcast and New Media Expo is a great
place for podcasters to network, but can also
be a great place to buy and sell used
podcasting equipment.
Handling with care and confirmation
If you’re selling your equipment and you’re fortu-
nate enough to receive your payment upfront, don’t
keep the customer waiting. Make sure you invest in
packing materials that make the item’s ride from
your house to its destination as ding- and damage-
free as possible.
You can use Styrofoam popcorn or newspaper
as your padding, but consider the mess and
hassle involved with both. Take that extra step
and find bubble wrap or Rapid Fill bags. They
can be an inexpensive and easy-to-dispense
packing material. You can find bubble wrap,
Rapid Fill bags, and even newspaper and
popcorn through online vendors of packing
materials such as ULine (www.uline.com)
and PackingPrice.com (www.packing
price.com).
If you go with the United States Post Office as your
courier service, say Yes to the Delivery Confirmation
service. It is an excellent way to confirm that the
package you’re sending has reached its destination.
If you make the investment in UPS (www.ups.com) or
Federal Express (www.fedex.com), make sure you
keep track of the paperwork from shipping your mer-
chandise. The receipt gives you a tracking number
that you can enter into a tracking page on the ship-
per’s Web site and zero in on the progress of your
merchandise from shipping center to destination.

that. We wanted to make sure you had some great
examples to listen and learn from, so this DVD
includes several episodes from different types of
podcasts. You’ll hear what goes into making a pro-
fessional podcast, learn how to organize and struc-
ture a good show, and probably enjoy the actual
episode as well. Here’s what we put on the disc:

The entire first season of Podcasting For Dummies
and two episodes from the second season.

Sample promos you can use in your own podcast
from the authors of this book.

Samples of podsafe music you can include on
your podcasts. Podsafe music can be used on
any podcast. You will need to contact the artists
for use outside of podcasts. Be sure to credit the
artist and the name of the track when you use it
in a podcast. The artist’s and track’s names are
both included in the filename. Authors include
Diane Arkenstone, George Hrab, Lisa Furukawa,
Jonathan Coulton, Beatnik Turtle, and
Background Trash.

Excerpts from podcasts and podiobooks created
by top podcasters. These excerpts demonstrate
the various styles and approaches that go into
creating a podcast. 
Podcast video
For Windows and Mac.
This section gives you some video examples of prac-
tices we’ve discussed in the book, as well as a sam-
ple video podcast from Stranger Things for you to
study and learn from. Topics covered in these exam-
ples include these:

Setting Sound Levels

Using the DVD 
To install the items from the DVD to your hard drive,
follow these steps.
1.
Insert the DVD into your computer’s DVD-ROM
drive. 
The license agreement appears.
Note to Windows users: The interface won’t
launch if you have Autorun disabled. In that
case, choose Start➪Run. (For Windows Vista,
choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Run.)
In the dialog box that appears, type D:\Start.exe.
(Replace D with the proper letter if your DVD
drive uses a different letter. If you don’t know the
letter, see how your DVD drive is listed under My
Computer.) Click OK.
Note for Mac Users: When the DVD icon appears
on your desktop, double-click the icon to open
the DVD, and then double-click the ClickMe icon.
2.
Read through the license agreement, and
then click the Accept button if you want to
use the DVD.
The DVD interface appears. The interface allows
you to access the contents with just a click of a
button (or two).
What You’ll Find on the DVD
The following sections are arranged by category;
they provide a summary of the goodies you’ll find
on the DVD. If you need help with installing the
items provided on the DVD, refer to the installation
instructions in the preceding section.

Sample media kits
When it comes time to publicize your podcast, you’ll
find these media kits extremely helpful. These exam-
ples show you great ways to tell others about your
show and give you an idea of what you might want
to include in your own media kit.
Podcast XML template
If you want to put together your own RSS feed for
your podcast, this XML file is a great place to start.
It’s been set up for you — all you have to do is insert
your own information and you’re ready to go.
Sample files
If you want to follow along with some of the step
lists in this book, look for the sample files (organ-
ized by practice number) on the DVD.
Links galore!
It might seem a little cruel to send you off searching
for some of the things we talked about in this book
on the Internet without a road map. The disc links to
an online page where you’ll find a plethora of links
to all sorts of useful information. You’ll find out
about software, vendors, equipment, and more with
just the click of a mouse!
Troubleshooting
We tried our best to compile content that works on
most computers with the minimum system require-
ments. Alas, your computer may differ, and some
programs may not work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have
enough memory (RAM) for the programs you want
to use, or you have other programs running that are
affecting installation or the running of a program. If
you get an error message such as Not enough mem-
ory or Setup cannot continue, try one or more of
the following suggestions and then try using the
software again:

Turn off any antivirus software running on
your computer. Installation programs some-
times mimic virus activity — and may make your
computer incorrectly believe that it’s being
infected by a virus.

Close all running programs. The more programs
you have running, the less memory is available to
other programs. Installation programs typically
update files and programs; so if you keep other
programs running, installation may not work
properly.

Have your local computer store add more RAM
to your computer. This is, admittedly, a drastic
and somewhat expensive step. However, adding
more memory can really help the speed of your
computer and allow more programs to run at the
same time.
