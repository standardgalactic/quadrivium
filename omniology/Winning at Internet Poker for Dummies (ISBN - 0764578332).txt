About the Authors
Mark “The Red” Harlan: Mark “The Red” Harlan was born in Rawlins,
Wyoming and has lived exactly the life you would expect as a result.
Armed with a degree in Applied Mathematics (from a school he never
utters the name of), he began a 20-year stint in the computer industry.
Red has worked with several cutting-edge Silicon Valley companies
ranging from Apple Computer (where, among other positions, he
was Human Interface Evangelist — making applications easier to
use and openly berating those who didn’t) to Danger (makers of the
T-Mobile Sidekick). Alarmingly, Red has probably already touched
your life, since he designed the bidding schema that is in use by
eBay today. Red has a heavy writing background (some of it actu-
ally readable) having authored Notes from the Fringe, InfoWorld’s
most popular computer column in the heyday of the Internet; and the
DevEdge News for Netscape’s developer community. Red now sports
the hefty title of Chief Marketing Officer at CyberArts Licensing, a
company providing software for the next generation of poker rooms
on the Internet (such as www.gamesgrid.com). CyberArts is the place
where Red mixes his love of poker with his deep understanding of
graphical user interfaces to make online poker easier to use, better
looking, and considerably more fun. Today Red lives a glamorous
lifestyle, roughly akin to a well-to-do college student, in Santa Clara,
California. Red welcomes non-spam email at mharlan@cyberarts.com.
Chris Derossi: Chris Derossi is a 20-year computer veteran and serial
entrepreneur. Having started his first company at the age of 14 he has
worked at a myriad of corporations since (creating several along the
way). Among other positions, Chris has been: the Chief Architect of
the Macintosh Operating System at Apple Computer, the founder of
ePeople, and the CEO of Trading Technologies. Chris was a founder
of MacTech magazine and has written extensively for the computer
industry, in publications such as Byte and Dr. Dobb’s Journal. Today,
Chris is the CEO of CyberArts Licensing, a software company working
feverishly to take Internet skill games (including poker, naturally) to
the next level. Aside from running day-to-day business matters, Chris
is responsible for the entire architecture of CyberArt’s poker offering
(seen at www.gamesgrid.com), ensuring that the technology is stable,
robust, and hugely scalable. For the last 15 years Chris has been an
avid poker player and is often found clutching the first place trophy
in the tournaments he enters. Chris was born in Laramie, Wyoming
and today lives in Henderson, Nevada (a stone’s throw from Las
Vegas) with his wife and two children. Chris can be reached at
cderossi@cyberarts.com. Red and Chris both man a Winning at

Dedication
From Mark “The Red” Harlan: I dedicate this book to Jacqueline
because I always said I would, to members of the Math Alliance just
because, and to my Uncle Poison because legends should live on.
From Chris Derossi: I dedicate this book to my wife, Jennifer, and
my children, Grayson and Miranda, who are always there with love
and support.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Red: My Mom, Marijane “Quarter Slots” Harlan, worked back-
breaking hospital nights for 20 years, simply to assure I was educated
and would turn out “okay.” There are debts I owe to the world and
then there is this. All moms wish they were as good as you.
Super-thanks to those Lakewood High School teachers from all
those years ago: Luanne “Thesis” Rohovec (Pendorf), for teaching
me how to write; Derald “Liver Green” Dunagan and Gary “Jag”
Hurst for teaching me how to think; and Nic “Shorts” Ament for the
bad ass poker nickname. You’d be amazed at the difference you’ve
made in my life. Books can’t be done without basic sustenance,
which is to say music, food, and caffeine. So thanks to Isaac “Shaft”
Hayes, Curtis “Superfly” Mayfield, Sly “Stand!” Stone, James “Mr.
Dynamite” Brown, Donna at the Hick’ry Pit, Hanan at the Original
Pancake House, Rahim at 7-11, and Clarus at the Bitmap Café. Dig it.
My Project Editor, Sherri “The Spine” Pfouts at Wiley was not only
forced to endure my incessant sassiness, taunting, and flexing of
deadlines; but she then went well above the call of duty by doing a
bunch of stuff (I still don’t even know what) to make my life easier
when my eye exploded in the midst of writing this book.
Then there is Chris “No Nickname” Derossi. A true force of a human
being, he’s the smartest and most ethical person I’ve ever done
business with. Chris has been and is always the calm in the eye
of the storm that is my life. His continual unquestioning support,
deep understanding of my psyche, and sharp attention to detail has
made this book not only happen crisply, but also be twice as good
as it would otherwise have been. And although I’m a considerably
better person just by knowing him, I still have no idea what he did
to deserve me. Thank you, sir.
And my sincere thanks to you, the reader. Nothing here is possible
without you. It sounds trite, but that doesn’t make it less true; you
have helped fulfill a lifelong dream of mine. I sincerely hope some-
thing in these pages makes you think, learn, or at least laugh. In the
Western world, time is the most precious of all commodities; I truly
appreciate you spending it with us.

From Chris: My name would not be on this book at all if it weren’t
for the monumental talent, effort, and graciousness of my coauthor,
partner, and friend, Mark Harlan. Writing a book takes an enormous
amount of work and creates a mountain of pressure. Mark not only
handled both with ease, he did it while keeping his sense of humor
and unique, thought-provoking outlook on life. Mark deserves most
of the credit for what’s on these pages, and he has my thanks and
respect for all of the sleep he gave up to get it done.
I must acknowledge Konstantin Othmer for introducing me to seri-
ous poker. Instead of keeping his friends in the dark to bolster his
poker profits, he helped us learn. I owe thanks to Kon for many
years of recreation and extra income.
Thanks also to Margot Maley Hutchison, who asked me if I wanted to
write a book when I first met her a decade ago. She waited patiently
until I said yes, and was very helpful throughout the entire process.
Finally, thanks to the many, many people who have helped and
encouraged me while I’ve spent countless hours in entrepreneurial
pursuits, of which this book is just a small part. I consider myself
to be fortunate enough to follow my dreams thanks to my family,
friends, and associates.

Introduction
F
or something like 150 years, people have been playing poker
on shady riverboats, in smokey backrooms of otherwise legiti-
mate businesses, in booze-laden college dorms, on cramped tent
floors, and at family kitchen tables. Although the games are often
social events, the underlying purpose is always the same: play,
play, play, and try to take as much of whatever you possibly can
from the steely-eyed person sitting across from you. Be it pretzels,
lingerie, or cold hard cash, what your opponents have is what you
want. Victors get the spoils; losers get large servings of crow 
(usually served cold with no garnish).
A few years ago, the Internet came along, and along with it, the first
“Big Change.” Now you can play against people anywhere in the
world, at any time of the day, and for varying sums of money. And
the card house where it all goes down is exactly as far away as
your computer.
Early concerns of cheating and the inability to see the faces of your
competitors, crossed with the uncertainty of passing electronic
cash to an unknown foreign entity, gave many would-be online
players reason to pause, but the efforts and technology aimed at
making the game safe have prevailed. Internet poker has truly
exploded in the past couple of years, no doubt due in large part to
the numerous televised poker events and Internet sponsorship of
some of the top players in the world.
The Internet traffic statistics are staggering, with the busiest poker
sites dwarfing the clientele at brick-and-mortar casinos: At any
given moment, tens of thousands of players duke it out on a multi-
tude of tables. Internet poker was nothing 10 years ago, and today
it’s a billion-dollar industry with no signs of subsiding.
In some ways, the online world is identical to the real one. You can
play Texas Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. You can play
less popular competitive games, such as Pineapple, Five-Card Stud
or Draw, or wild card games, depending on the site. You can com-
pete for play chips or hard currency. You can play in ring games or
tournaments.

But in some ways, the online world is very different. You have to be
able to judge a site for quality. You have to download and master
the software. You have to make electronic transactions over-the-
wire to move your cash. And don’t forget that you have to choose
between table sizes and game types.
At first it can all be a little much. But don’t despair. You have a
clear path through this wilderness. Come along, and we’ll take you
there.
About This Book
This book specifically covers the nuances of Internet poker as
compared to everything in the brick-and-mortar world. You should
think of Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies as an augmentation
to any and all poker knowledge you already have; you definitely
shouldn’t think of this book as the stand-alone, end-all, be-all poker
reference. We’ve written this text to dovetail cleanly with Poker 
For Dummies (Wiley), but it can just as easily walk hand-in-hand
with any other beginning or intermediate poker text.
Thinking Internet poker is identical to brick-and-mortar poker can
be a costly mistake. The two are similar, but they have key differ-
ences. Our main goal is to point out the differences and help you
avoid the myriad of pitfalls lying in wait for the unsuspecting.
We help you discover the nuances of an Internet poker table, pick a
site to your liking, and transfer your electronic funds. From there,
we take a peek at online poker psychology and delve into some of
the unusual table sizes and games that, for the most part, only
exist online. After we get you playing, we give you handy tips and
tricks on how to stay ahead of the game — and hopefully even win.
Conventions Used in This Book
Some of the special terminology we use in this book includes:
 Brick and mortar: We use this phrase to describe real, physi-
cal cardrooms where you sit across a table from live human
beings. It doesn’t necessarily have to mean casinos; in most
cases, you can just as easily think about any home game you
play in.

 Godzilla: Large radioactive monster that mostly hangs out in
Tokyo bay. Aggressive player with a good poker face — bad
temper when losing. Known as Gojira in Japan (“go” from the
English gorilla and “jira,” the Japanese world for whale). We
talk about Godzilla a little in Chapter 13.
 Hard currency: When we use this phrase, we mean the
money that you have on deposit with a poker site — the
actual money that you gamble with. When you place a $1 bet
online, you put hard currency on the line. We use this phrase
to minimize confusion with money as a general concept.
Chapter 4 is where we talk about transferring your money
online.
 Ring game: A single poker table, with anything from two to
ten players, where everyone competes for hard currency. You
can come and go as you please in these games. Some brick-
and-mortar players call this game form money play.
 Tournament: A special form of poker where you pay a set
entry fee, plus a smaller registration fee, to receive a set
amount of tournament chips. Players compete, busting out
one by one, until only one person remains. Chapter 10 is
where we start to get down with tourneys.
For a slightly longer glossary, head to the Appendix in the back of
this book.
What You’re Not to Read
Well, maybe you shouldn’t take it to the “I boycott this” extreme,
but we should let you in on a couple of things to know about this
book:
 Sidebars contain information that you don’t have to read to
understand Internet poker. They serve as asides, anecdotes,
or extended forms of examples. Only reading the sidebars in
this book is the mental equivalent of sitting on the back porch
and hearing your favorite poker stories from your uncle.
 Order doesn’t matter. That being said, you can read anything
you want without hurting our feelings. Read any chapter at
any point. Feel free to skip around. We use copious cross-
references to help you understand anything you may have
skipped over during your reading journey.
Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
In order to begin, we’ve made several assumptions about you, our
dear reader. We assume that
 You’re already familiar with the basic forms of poker, and that
you have a cursory understanding of poker strategy. If you
don’t, turn around right now and buy yourself a copy of 
Poker For Dummies (Wiley) or some other introductory-to-
intermediate text on the game.
 You can use a computer and have the ability to connect to
the Internet. We also assume that you have downloaded and
installed software onto your computer before. If these concepts
are foreign to you, pick up a copy of Internet For Dummies
(Wiley) and/or PCs For Dummies (Wiley).
 You’ve used the Internet to the extent that you’re familiar 
with using search engines and making elementary transac-
tions (for instance, you’ve bought something online).
 You think winning is better than losing. If you don’t, we hon-
estly can’t tell you where to go for help, but we’d love to sit
with you the next time you play.
 You’re a noble human being. You must be if you’re willing to
spend this much time with us, and hey, we truly appreciate it.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve intentionally written this book in such a way that you can
jump into it at any point and just go. We haven’t created complete
word chaos, however; here’s the method to our madness:
Part I: Internet Poker Basics
This section talks about the hardware and software you need to
play, includes a tour of an Internet poker table, tells you how to
pick a quality poker site, and coaches you through the transfer of
your precious money. By the time you reach the end of this sec-
tion, you should be able to play a simple game of poker online.

Internet, and we let you in on a few secrets about what’s different
in the online poker world, including a bit on the nuances of
Internet poker psychology.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments
Here you find the down and dirty on the strategic differences
between the Internet and the brick-and-mortar world for tourna-
ments. We also drill into unusual table sizes and those crazy 
single-table tournaments.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Lists, lists, lists. This part is the dessert after your tasty meal. Here
we give you ways to not screw up your Internet poker game, how
to keep your head on straight in the heat of the battle, where to go
to find more great Internet poker info, and tips on how to behave in
the brick-and-mortar world after you leave cyberspace (should you
ever venture out of your cave, that is).

Internet Poker
Basics

In this part . . .
H
ere we cover all the basics: the hardware and soft-
ware you need, criteria for choosing a site of quality,
and the nitty-gritty of moving your money online. We even
give a tour of an online poker table.

Combination: Poker, 
the Internet, and You
In This Chapter
 Winning cold, hard cash (or maybe soft, electronic cash)
 Understanding the differences between the real and cyber worlds
 Assembling the necessary hardware, software, and poker knowledge
T
he online poker boom has been astounding. At the end of 2004,
at any given moment, more than 10,000 players were competing
on over 150 poker sites. On any given day, combined bets totaled
more than $130 million. And the numbers keep going up.
And not surprisingly, not all the new attendees play poker well.
Sure, you have to watch out for some sharks, hustlers, and poker
savants; but the misfits, slackers, and the terminally distracted
greatly outnumber the dangerous players. In online play in general,
and especially at the lower-limit tables, you have the potential to
make a lot of money.
In this chapter, we talk about the basics of Internet poker, as well
as the raw materials you need to play a truly fascinating form of
America’s favorite card game (and recently, America’s favorite
game, period).
And the rest of the book? Well, we talk about everything else there.

Me, Winning on the Internet? 
You Bet!
In case you’re confused by the title of the book, we should get one
thing clear from the start: Yes, you can win money playing poker
on the Internet. Recognizing that, however, doesn’t make it easy.
Even if you’ve “mastered” brick-and-mortar play, you can’t simply
walk in and take the candy from all the Net brats. You come screen
to screen with some pretty tough players. Heck, Net dwellers have
won the past two World Series of Poker Main Events in Las Vegas.
But coming out on top of your favorite game is certainly possible,
and to do that you need to know your poker theory and have
money to put on the virtual table.
The most important thing to understand about Internet poker is
that you’re still playing poker.
Knowing your poker theory
With very few exceptions, nearly all the poker theory you already
know and have gleaned over your life applies in the Internet world.
You must deal with nuances and fine points, yes (and you can bet
that we cover those in detail, such as in Chapter 3), but poker is
poker, no matter the form or forum.
If you’re looking for general poker theory, you can’t find much of it
here (with the exception of single-table tournaments on demand,
which we cover in Chapters 12 and 13), but you can find the info in
books like Poker For Dummies (Wiley). If you aren’t familiar with
the nuances of poker itself, you should read and study up on gen-
eral theory first before you play with any hard currency online.
In any betting situation, the basis to making money is being more
informed than your opponent. If you ignore reading up on poker
theory, the players who aren’t so cavalier will beat you in the 
long run.
If you’re not completely up on poker theory, don’t let it stop you
from getting started. You can always play for free chips, which we
talk about in Chapter 8. In fact, you can also play in free-roll tourna-
ments, where you pay nothing and still have a chance to win hard
currency (check out Chapter 10).
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
10

Dealing with the dough
In order to win money, you have to throw in a few bucks yourself.
Such is the law of the land when it comes to poker (except for
those extra-special free-roll tournaments). So before you can play
for hard currency online, you have to get money to your poker 
site — which can scare some people silly. We first want to tell you:
You have safe outlets to get your money online . . . and safe ways
get it out again. The most common mechanism for money transfer
is through electronic payment services that you connect directly
to your bank account. You can write an electronic check as well.
For more information about all things green, see Chapter 4.
If you don’t want to lose a lot of cash while you learn, we recom-
mend free-chip games and free-roll tournaments as tools to get you
up to speed. (See Chapters 8 and 10.) But only play these forms of
“poker” to get used to the Internet and to get familiar with a partic-
ular game. When you’re comfortable playing at these levels, make
sure you move on.
If you play too long with no potential for loss, you’re bound to
develop some bad poker habits, which we also cover in Chapter 10.
Stepping Out of the Casino
Mentality
Although they both offer run-of-the-mill poker, the online poker
environment is far different from the brick-and-mortar world sur-
roundings. You need to give up what you know and love about
Chapter 1: Creating a Winning Combination 11
Just like real money, but faster
Yes, the money you play for online is the real deal. That’s the good news, of course.
The bad news is you can lose real money as well.
Because of the speed of computer play, a full Internet table goes through more than
twice as many hands per hour than the brick-and-mortar equivalent. That means
you can expect your money swings to be twice as big on the Net: If you play a win-
ning strategy, you win twice as fast; if you play a losing strategy, you watch your
money walk away at double the speed.
Chapter 8 goes into detail about easing into money play online with micro-limit
(small-limit) games. We talk more about the ramifications of speed in Chapters 3
and 5.

playing in the casino and hunker down by yourself, in the corner,
with your computer. Besides your physical surroundings, you
experience other differences too . . . like when you want to actually
play, you have to first download a poker site’s software. Next you
have to realize that looking for tells is a bit different, because your
opponent may be sitting somewhere across the planet rather than
across the table in front of you. And if you’re still desiring a bigger
challenge, don’t worry: You also have to deal with bigger bets online.
Playing poker on the download
To get up and running in the online world, you need a poker client
(a program that runs on your computer) that you download from
the poker Web site of your choice. When you play, your client talks
to a poker server on your site. The server acts partially as a commu-
nication mechanism between you and the other players. When you
make any action (call, raise, bet, fold, sit down at the table, and so
on), your client passes that information to the server, which relays
the action to all your opponents. When your opponents make an
action, your site’s server relays the information back to you.
We talk about how to pick a quality site in Chapter 2. Downloading
software is super easy, and we also cover installation and use in
Chapters 2 and 3.
Looking for tells online
The most obvious difference between the physical and the online
world is that you don’t have another player glaring at you from
across the table. The lack of player presence directs your focus to
the game, whereas before you may have split your time between
looking at your opponent and the cards in play.
But being alone doesn’t mean that you play in a world devoid of
tells and clues about another player’s bluff (or worse, when he
tries to sucker you in with a killer hand). It just means that the
clues you want to keep track of and watch for are different. We
cover the psychological aspect of “reading” online players in more
detail in Chapter 6.
Experiencing poker in the pure
Experience shows that, in many ways, Internet poker is a purer
form of the game. The decisions you make tend to be more posi-
tional than in the brick-and-mortar world. Where you sit in relation
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
12

to betting around the table and the number of chips you have rela-
tive to the other players (especially in tournament play) hold
bigger roles.
In the online world, you see bigger betting (pushing all-in in no-
limit games for example), largely because you come across more
novice players and the stakes can be lower (so players don’t have
as much to lose). You also see a little less folding (especially in low
buy-in, no-limit games) than in the brick-and-mortar world. We
delve into these nuances, and more, in Chapter 3.
Gathering the Basics
Before you can play poker on your computer, you need three
things: money, the right hardware and software combo, and a
hungry poker brain.
Chapter 1: Creating a Winning Combination 13
Your pal, the rake
We do know of one way that the online world is identical to brick-and-mortar ca-
sinos: the way they make money, namely through the rake. The rake is a small per-
centage of every pot that the poker sites take (usually 5 percent, but sometimes as
high as 10 percent). They typically cap the rake at $3.
The rake is a good moneymaking mechanism for the house, because losers don’t
care where their money goes, and a winner doesn’t mind scooping a $97 pot rather
than one worth $100. But the erosion is real and unavoidable.
For tournaments, sites charge a registration fee, usually 10 percent of the tourney
buy-in, that goes directly to the site. A $10 single-table tournament costs you $11
($10 plus a $1 entry fee).
A few sites have a no-flop, no-drop policy. If the site’s Hold ’Em or Omaha players
never see a flop, it doesn’t take a rake. Other sites don’t rake any pot less than one
dollar, which is nice for micro-limit games (for more on micro-limits, see Chapter 8).
To find out about a site’s rake rules, look at the help or about section of its Web site.
You don’t have a way to reduce the rakes directly, but by taking advantage of sign-
up bonuses and “bonus bonuses” (see Chapter 2 for all bonus info), you can cer-
tainly help reduce their sting.
Turbo tournaments sometimes cut the registration fee slightly. A $25 tourney may
only have a $2 fee, rather than $2.50, and over the long run you can use every penny
of your savings. For more on turbo tourneys, see Chapter 7.

Meeting the minimum requirements
If you want to play for money online, you have to have money. For
the most part you need electronically-transferable cash (a few sites
accept bank checks through the mail — the slowest and clunkiest
way to transfer money — but many no longer accept checks
directly). Credit cards usually don’t work, but debit cards often do,
along with electronic checks (ACH in bankspeak) and some forms
of phone cards. We dedicate Chapter 4 to all money matters.
Sites also have an age restriction. You always have to be at least
18, and some require you to be 21. See the site’s rules and regula-
tions for the requirements.
Getting the computer goods
You need three things computer-wise to get going: the proper hard-
ware, a good connection, and a site’s poker software.
Hardware
For hardware, you need nothing more than a reliable PC that can
run a fairly modern version of Windows (the later the better —
nothing earlier than the 1998 version). As tempting as it may
sound, you don’t want to play on some flake-box machine that, say,
automatically shuts off on odd-numbered days or tends to eat a
hard drive about once a week.
Unlike when you’re playing video games, the speed of your com-
puter, as well as the speed of its connection, doesn’t matter. But
you do have to worry about the reliability of your connection.
Poker isn’t a game of millisecond reaction speed. Sites give their
players plenty of time to act, so what matters most is that your
connection is reliable. By reliable, we mean you don’t get dropped
after you connect to the Internet.
Although a newer version of Windows works best, if you have an
old Windows ’98 system parked in the garage, you may want to res-
urrect it for use as a dedicated online poker machine after you
catch the online fever. It saves you some familial embarrassment
caused by pacing back and forth behind 8-year-old Timmy while
you anxiously wait for him to finish his homework on your home’s
main PC. We’re not suggesting you buy a machine just to play
poker, but if you have an old one lying around, you can put it to
good use.

An Internet connection
A dial-up modem that never drops you is much better than a DSL
connection that goes belly up every 20 minutes. If you have the
luxury of choosing different connection means, pick the one that
won’t drop you mid-hand. See Chapter 2 for a little more on con-
nection basics and Chapter 5 for information on detecting, and
coping with, disconnection.
Poker software
Poker software itself is always free of charge from the site of your
choosing. (Don’t even think about playing a site that tries to charge
you just to download its stuff.) Expect downloading to take just a
couple minutes if you have a high-speed connection and possibly
more than 20 if you have dial-up. We talk more about downloading
and the fine art of choosing a good site in Chapter 2.
Bulking up your poker know-how
This book concentrates on the specific nuances of Internet poker.
If you’re not generally familiar with poker as a game, have never
played for hard currency, or don’t have a good handle on crazy
poker lingo, you need to get a good primer and brush-up. Poker 
For Dummies (Wiley) is an excellent choice (we designed our book
to dovetail with that one), as are any number of other poker texts.
Chapter 16 gives some good resources you can check out for rec-
ommendations on general poker theory, as well as places where
you can buy, buy, buy to your little chip-pushing heart’s content.
Choosing Your Poker Path
You have many more paths you can take in the online world com-
pared to brick-and-mortar casinos. You can play in tournaments or
ring games. You can play fixed-limit or no-limit. You can play Hold
’Em, Omaha, or Stud (and even wild card games). You can play at
tables with as many as nine other players or head’s up against a
sole contender. What separates the Internet world is that you play
all these types of games at any time, not just when management
gives you the go-ahead in a brick-and-mortar casino.
And you can skip around this book, depending on what you want
to do:

 If you’ve never played poker before and you want to try 
it out for free right now, choose a site we list in Chapter 2.
Download the software, go to Chapter 3 and figure out the
button controls, and then start gambling with play money. All
poker sites also have game basics in their help sections —
you can definitely learn enough there to play.
 If you’re an experienced hard currency player in the real
world, take a quick skim of Chapter 3 to find out about your
online controls. Make a hard study of Chapter 2 to choose a
great site, and then follow the directions in Chapter 4 to make
a financial deposit.
 If you’re already a denizen of the online poker world, but
you’ve just now decided to shift over to play seriously for
hard currency, head to Chapter 5. Get our take on the psychol-
ogy of online poker.

 Setting up your real world to play in the virtual one
 Picking your playground
 Getting the software you need
 Creating your identity
A
cquiring and installing Internet poker software ranks right up
there with some of the most painless “new” computer expe-
riences you can ever have. The hardware and Net connectivity
required are minimal, and the whole software operation essentially
boils down to clicking a download button on a poker site to get a
poker client that runs your game. A single click of the icon after
you download and you’re off and running.
Your biggest concern should be picking a good site. With our
checklist throughout this chapter, you can confidently put any
potential host under the microscope of quality. But before you get
too far along and jump straight into the downloading and playing
process, you should tweak the real-world room where your com-
puter sits just a tad.
In this chapter, we give you some tips on getting yourself 
comfortable — both physically and with your new poker site —
getting your software situated, and crafting your identity for play.

Creating Your Virtual Poker
Environment
The fight between online gaming sites for your business is fierce,
and because of this competition, poker providers make sure that
the hardware, software, and connection environment you need is
fairly minimal and user-friendly. Such service allows you to focus
on setting up your poker environment to maximize your gaming
experience.
Figuring out hardware and 
software requirements
As it stands right now, online poker isn’t computationally (nor 
display) intensive. Essentially, your computer acts as a glorified
accountant and rule keeper; it really doesn’t have any heavy work
to do. If you’re still trying to get by with that wind-up 286 box from
the ’80s, this could quite possibly be the best news you’ve heard
all day.
Hardware
If you have a machine capable of running a fairly modern version
of Windows — Windows 98 or later, for example — you have all the
hardware firepower you need. The audio and video involved with
an online poker game are extremely simple sounds and animations
(cards flipped over on a table, a beep reminding you to bet or fold,
chips pushed from one area to another, and so on). No site cur-
rently offers more sophisticated options, such as streaming audio
and video from other players, although such perks seem fairly
inevitable. (Start setting your computer camera up — strip poker
can’t be far behind!)
It doesn’t matter if you want to play on a laptop or a desktop. If
you have a choice of machines, pick the one you feel most comfort-
able using for long periods of time.
If your screen is kind of fuzzy, and you don’t normally stare at it for
excessive periods of time, you may want to consider upgrading to
a new monitor. Gawking at fuzzy images for hours at a time is
draining, and when you play online poker, you have enough hap-
pening in the fatigue department without adding any grief.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
18

System software
As far as Operating System (OS) versions go — as with everything
else in the computer world — the more recent the version, the
better. You shouldn’t start up anything older than Windows 98 if
you can avoid it, although you can always try anything (especially
if your threshold for frustration is fairly high).
If you have multiple Windows possibilities to choose from, we rec-
ommend Windows XP. Not only is XP a recent, currently supported
version, but it also was most likely the version of choice by the
programmers who created your poker site software. If you run into
problems with your site’s software, the support people are more
likely to be able to help you on XP than with other versions of the
Windows OS.
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 19
The problem with Macintosh
As of press time, no hard currency poker sites that cater to the Macintosh are of
high enough quality to discuss in this book. This doesn’t mean that you Apple users
are without options. You can:
 Wait. With the online casinos competing so heavily, the various sites can’t afford
to keep ignoring a base of potential customers. Keep an eye on the sites we list
in the section “Sifting through the sites” later in this chapter. You can also occa-
sionally look at a version site, such as www.versiontracker.com, or a soft-
ware review site, like www.mygamblingdirectory.com, to check out
various listings.
 Play for free. Find a site where it doesn’t matter what computer you use. Many
sites offer free poker online. For example, the games section of Yahoo!
(games.yahoo.com) has Hold ’Em. The problem is that free play isn’t a good
reflection of money play. It doesn’t make your level of play any better, and it may
well make it worse. But hey, you do get to play poker against other humans.
 Find a money site with a Java client. We should emphasize that we don’t rec-
ommend playing with Java clients because the user experience is so abysmal
(very slow and uneven). But it does give you an option in a world where your
choices are few.
 Get a cheap Windows machine. Heresy, you say? Maybe, but you should con-
sider this: We both worked for Apple, but we play online on Windows boxes.
(And when we do, Chris wears his super-nerdy-yet-sexy Apple belt buckle, and
Red wears his ultra-cool Mac project T-shirts. It is true, however, that those
items burn our bodies as we play.)

If you try an OS older than Windows 98, be certain to extensively
test the site you’re interested in with free chips first. You don’t
want any nasty surprises when the hard currency hits the table.
Connecting your Internet necessities
One of the most attractive features of online poker is your ability to
play with the barest of Internet connections. The only disadvantage
of using a slower dial-up modem is the amount of time it takes to
download the client (the poker program running on your computer)
from the poker Web site; it takes about 20 minutes over a modem
versus just a couple shakes of a mouse pad with a broadband con-
nection (such as DSL). After you download the poker program from
the site of your choice (see the section “Sifting through the sites”
later in this chapter for the most popular), you’re set to go. If you
have to play from a world where your Internet connection is slow,
don’t fret: Your opponents have no strategic advantage, of any
kind, in having faster network connections.
In short, if you can reliably connect to the Internet, easily see Web
pages on your computer, and you use an Operating System version
no older than Windows 98, you can play poker online.
Although a slow network connection is perfectly fine for online
poker, a flaky connection that goes down often isn’t (regardless of
connection speed). If you lose your network connection in the
middle of a hand, you may be able to reconnect in time before the
site folds your hand, but not always. And when you play for hard
currency, losing your hand to a bad connection can be costly if
you’ve already invested money in the pot. See Chapter 5 for more
on disconnection.

Poker in the palm of your hand
You can’t, as of now, find any hard currency-based handheld environments (such as
Windows CE, Palm OS, or custom cell phone environments), but we keep hearing a
ton of rumors about them. It seems that their existence in the not-too-distant future
is a near certainty.
The big problem the handheld world has is unreliable connectivity; so when poker
finally does fall into your palm, expect the interaction to be a bit different. It may be
something like head’s-up play only, where you’re allowed five minutes per betting
decision. This is pure guesswork on our part, just to give you a feeling of where the
future may lead.

Getting comfortable at the computer
Playing poker online isn’t only about computers and software; after
all, you don’t play inside your computer. Give some thought to the
physical space you play in; the more comfortable and focused you
can make your playing environment, the more focused you can
become at game time.
Go through the following steps to ensure a comfortable and
focused poker experience:
 Set up your screen in as glare-free a position as possible.
You don’t want to misread your hands — especially important
in Seven-Card Stud (see Chapter 7), where you have to view a
greater number of cards in various positions around the table.
 Find a good spot for your drinks and food. You have to sit
for long periods of time, so you need to plan ahead of time for
your sustenance. Remember: Bad beats are made about
10 times worse if you spill a soda on your keyboard as they
happen.
 Put a trash basket within arm’s reach. Respect the final rest-
ing spot for your waste and you greatly reduce the chance
that you’ll fling an empty bottle when you get outdrawn on
the river. (Mathematical note: Having a trash basket at arm’s
reach doesn’t reduce your chances of being outdrawn on the
river.)
 Minimize your distractions. Sure, every brick-and-mortar
cardroom has a television showing such superlative tidbits as
the Saharan Dune Bobsled Racing Championships, but watch-
ing TV doesn’t help you win; it can only hurt.
 Play sober. Yes, it may be tempting to knock down a few icy
cold ones as you play, but it doesn’t help you keep a positive
balance in your poker site’s account. Being drunk only lessens
the pain as you hit yourself in the financial head, but it doesn’t
make the lump any smaller the next day.
Choosing a Site
You may be nervous when you first set up to play online, and you
may have a ton of questions running through your mind. Is sharing
my bank account information safe? Am I getting a fair deal? Or
more generally, how can I trust these people?
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 21

The site you pick is where the magic happens. The joys and tears.
The fretting and calculating. The cursing and jubilation. The lucky
draws and the bad beats. So how do you find a place worthy of all
this emotion?
It turns out that finding a site isn’t very difficult, and the process is
surprisingly risk-free. Sure, you face a little uncertainty in any
financial transaction, but this section shows you how to minimize
your risks and helps you feel comfortable with where you finally
end up. Hundreds of thousands of people in the world now play
poker safely online; you can easily become one of them if you know
what to look for.
Judging sites for quality
We want to stress that we’re not recommending the individual
companies or groups we mention in this chapter; we just want to
give you guidelines with a little bit of logic so that you can make
better decisions for yourself in the future. Consider the following
factors when choosing a poker site, in no particular order:
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
22
Always remember: You’re the customer
Above all, any time you’re playing on a poker site for hard currency, never forget
that you’re a customer. If you don’t like something about a particular poker site —
be it the site’s management, the response you get from the support staff, downtime
on the poker site, or the way the poker interface works — feel free (if not obligated)
to move along to a site more deserving of your hard-earned cash.
When you play for hard currency, the site reduces every pot you win with a rake that
it keeps for profit. (See Chapter 1 for more on rakes.) Even though it may seem like
a token amount (because you receive the lion’s share of those pots), you do pay to
play, and in the long run, you pay dearly (assuming you win a lot of pots . . . if not,
you pay your opponents dearly). If you feel that you don’t get your money’s worth,
quickly go and try another site.
And don’t forget to extract your money when you leave a site for good. (See Chapter
4 for details on getting your money when you leave.) You don’t have to feel good
about the money you give to your poker host, but you should never feel like you’re
giving money to a lame organization, especially when you have a myriad of choices
available to you. Make sure you’re comfortable giving money to a respectable serv-
ice that allows you to make money.

 The country the site is based in and its licenses. Due to 
the way gaming restrictions work in the United States, all
servers must be located outside America’s borders. Until a
few years ago, nearly all quality sites were based in Costa Rica.
Subsequently, the Kanawake Indian Reservation in Canada 
has made site hosting attractive enough that most compa-
nies have moved there (those sites almost always boast a
“Kanawake Gaming Commission” seal). Even more recently,
the full-member EU nation of Malta established laws for
Internet gaming licenses. Expect many of the best sites to be
licensed in Malta until the UK enacts its online gaming laws, at
which point Britain may become the jurisdiction of choice. In
general, gaming licenses awarded by countries require opera-
tors to be held to higher standards. So if the site doesn’t have
a license, think twice. We expect fake poker sites to eventually
start popping up with the sole intent to take people’s money.
Keep your eyes peeled and choose intelligently.
 Badges of approval. Given by organizations that provide
secure transactions and/or auditing. One example would be
Price Waterhouse Coopers (www.pwc.com — a well-respected
consulting firm that has audited shuffling algorithms). It 
doesn’t mean the site is great, but it does mean that a
respected third party has looked at its software. Some of the
same software scrutiny is involved when an operator applies
for a gaming license, especially from governmental agencies
such as those in Malta and Alderney.
 Action. The more regularly a site has active games going, the
more legitimate you can assume it to be. A good way to see
the top sites in raw number of players is to go to PokerPulse
(www.pokerpulse.com) and look at the data it has on the
number of players at a site. Be wary of any site that falls quiet
due to periodic inactivity.
 Use of third parties for money deposit. If a poker site uses
third parties for its money transactions (for example, NETeller
or Western Union), that site has to be in compliance with the
third party’s regulations. Even if you don’t transfer money
through a third party, knowing your available options gives
credibility to the site. (See Chapter 4 for much more on the
subject of money.)
 Free play. All quality sites grant you free chips if you want to
try the site for literally nothing. Even if you never play a single
free hand, you should stay away from sites that don’t offer
free play.
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 23

 The smoothness of play. Quality also means how the site feels
to you. Even if you have the most trusted poker site on the
planet and all your friends dig it two times, if something really
bugs you while you play there, you should go somewhere
else. Follow these tips to get a feel for your site:
• Play for free on a site you’re interested in for a long
period before you switch over to hard currency.
• Get used to the action buttons and look for idiosyncrasies
in the way the site works (like the bad overlapping action
buttons we mention in Chapter 3).
If something rubs you the wrong way, keep looking.
 Bugs in the software. You can’t find a piece of sizeable soft-
ware in the world that doesn’t have bugs in it, but if you find
something glaring during free play (like the poker client
causes your computer to freeze and become unresponsive),
keep looking until you find something better.
 Connectivity problems. If you keep getting dropped from a
site, the site may be having connectivity problems. You
should also check to make sure you aren’t having ISP (Internet
Service Provider) problems by browsing around a couple of
non-related Web sites. If you’re still connected to the Internet
but you’re not getting poker from your site, your poker host
may be causing the problem. Consider looking elsewhere. See
Chapter 5 for more on disconnection.
 Identical sites. If you run across a site that looks and acts
absolutely identical to another site, you may have found one
site that licensed its software from another. Poke around a
little to see who the copycat is. All else being equal, a site that
licenses software has far less ability to fix bugs or implement
new features because it doesn’t have any software engineers
working on staff. Also, a site that licenses software often has
far less cash to use for marketing and promos. A site with its
own software not only offers new features at a quicker rate,
but it also stands a greater chance of staying in business two
years from now. Even if the risk of any given site going under
is small, if it does go under, your money may go with it.
 User feedback. When you play for free to get a feel for a site,
ask other people at the table what they think of the site and
what they like or don’t like. Ask them if they play anywhere
else. The answers you get may be the most telling of all.

Knowing you’re getting a fair deal
If you pick a quality site, you’re practically assured of getting a fair
deal. Resting easy with your site choice is more a matter of psy-
chology than it is of cyber world practice. A favorite rant of online
poker players (always after another hand outdraws them on the
river) is “that never happens in the real world.” Well, we have bad
news for you: It happens everywhere, and the site isn’t out to 
get you.
Bad beat situations in the online world are no different than in the
brick-and-mortar world, and the online poker world is no less fair.
The one thing you do see more of in the online world is hands per
hour, which means you also see more bad beats per hour. But the
relative percentage of bad beats is no higher. Stop and think about
it for a second: What advantage would a site have in dealing you an
unfair game?
For starters, poker sites don’t have a vested interest in your game;
all they care about is the raw amount of action at the table — the
more the better, because they make money off each game. So if you
feel like the site cheats you, and you leave, it does the site no good.
No site can afford bad word of mouth.
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 25
Sites on collusion control
Collusion happens when multiple players pool knowledge and use it against another
player. It can be something as simple as two players at the same table telling each
other their cards (by an instant messenger service or by telephone) so the weakest
player drops his hand. Or it can be more brutal and aggressive, such as two play-
ers raising and re-raising each other until the unsuspecting third party simply folds
his hand.
As a player at a table, collusion is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to spot.
Poker sites, however, have an easier time. They can see everyone’s hole cards, so
they can tell how often players make runs at pots with garbage. They also keep
detailed records of players who consistently play together at the same table, as well
each player’s originating Internet address (sites can sometimes tell if people play in
the same room).
By combining all this information, as well as a few other metrics, sites can have a
pretty good idea of who tries to cheat the system.
And at high-stakes tables, such as $30/$60 Texas Hold ’Em, sites add human beings
to monitor the activity — providing yet another level of surveillance.

Poker sites make plenty of money by doing their normal business
without the need to cheat you. All any quality poker site wants to
do is make its game run smoothly and keep you playing. No site
offering regular hard currency games wants to risk having its busi-
ness shut down permanently because of illicit activity. So not only
do the good sites deal an honest game, but they also take active
measures on your behalf to make sure it stays honest, like keeping
an eye out for collusion (players ganging up to make money — see
the sidebar “Sites on collusion control” for more).
In the early days of online poker, we came across some weird
anomalies. We know of a site where you could predict the random
number generator (the computer algorithm that “shuffles” cards
by picking random numbers). On another, you could peek at the
hole cards of your opponents. Fortunately, those bad old days 
are now long gone. Random number generators have become
extremely sophisticated (including features like combining mouse
movements across all computers on the site). Sites now send hole
cards, in encrypted form, to only one player’s computer and
nowhere else.
If you choose a quality site, the cards you get are random. You get
a fair game. It may be hard to believe when you get eliminated from
your third straight tournament by your third straight bad beat on
the river, but it doesn’t make the game any less honest. (Check out
the section “Sifting through the sites” later in this chapter for info
on picking a quality site.)
Picking up your perks for signing up
The easiest way to make money is to have someone hand it to you,
right? Well, that basically happens when you sign up as a new
poker player on many, if not all, of today’s online poker sites. It
may seem like a throwback to the old crazy days of the Internet
when companies gave away a free yacht when you bought a pound
of dog food (and told investors they’d figure out how to make
money off those customers later).
But it all makes sense to the online sites, because poker is incredi-
bly “sticky.” If you start playing at a certain site’s place, it knows
that you’ll probably keep coming back. In these heady days of the
Jetsons, where one or two clicks to download software from some
other site just seems like way too much “work,” poker sites figure
(rightly) that you’ll stay put after you start playing. So they assume
that the money they give you now will end up back in their pockets
in the form of rake sooner or later.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
26

Sites typically offer you a percentage of your initial deposit as a
bonus — something like 20 percent. That means if you open an
account with $100, your site gives you an extra $20. Sites always
have a cap set at a maximum dollar amount, however. Something
like $100 from the site’s side.
Now before you go running off, depositing and withdrawing like a
crazed bank clerk, you need to be aware of a mild catch that comes
with getting (what our friend Mark “Solid” Goldstein refers to as)
free money: You have to play a minimum number of hands to get
your bonus. The hand restriction varies, but you typically have to
play something along the lines of five times as many hands as you
have dollars in bonus due to you, or you have to play at tables
where the total rake the site takes while you play is equal to your
bonus.
Before you transfer money for the first time into an online poker
site’s vault, be sure to read the fine print of its bonus offering
closely.
Try to deposit in a way that allows you to maximize the bonus the
house is willing to give you and still achieve your goal of actually
receiving the bonus (such as the way we give you in the sidebar
“Don’t judge a bonus by its cover” in this chapter).
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 27
Don’t judge a bonus by its cover
Say you’re considering a site that gives you a 20 percent bonus on your first deposit
of up to $500. You could conceivably get $100 added to your account if you don’t
mind ponying up the full $500. Close examination of the fine print shows that you
have to play at tables taking an equivalent amount of rake ($100 in this case) before
the site gives you your bonus, but the site has no time limit on how long it can take
you to earn your bonus.
If you’ve played the site for free and decided you like it, it may be worth your while
to go ahead and sink $500 and play until you hit your magic number. The site cashier
keeps you informed of where you stand relative to earning your bonus.
Now say you’re in the same bonus situation, but in this instance you have a time
limit as to how long you can take to earn the perk (the site must get the $100 in rake
in the first 30 days, for example). Now the situation gets more difficult. To get a rough
feel for how much rake you may generate, go watch a full hard currency table at the
dollar limit you’re interested in. Keep track of the rake the house takes over several
minutes, and then do the necessary math to figure out how many minutes you have
to play to earn your bonus. This observation should give you a pretty good idea as
to whether you can reach the amount of play you need within your bonus time limit.

Bonuses are an all-or-nothing affair with online cardrooms. If you
want to earn a $100 bonus and you get 80 percent of the way there,
you don’t get as much as a penny until you earn that last 20 percent.
So if you deposit $500 and manage to lose it all before your deposit
comes, you have to deposit more to earn your original bonus.
When making a decision on how much bonus money you want to
earn, if you’re unsure you can meet the criteria for receiving the
bonus, always err on the side of playing less. Receiving a smaller
bonus for less play is better than receiving no bonus for not play-
ing enough.
When you first start playing online, a reasonable strategy you can
try is to play on one site until you earn its new player bonus and
then move on to the next, playing until you earn again. Lather,
rinse, repeat as often as you like. Jumping sites for bonuses not
only maximizes the amount of money you can earn from poker
sites, but it also gives you a nice survey of the joint you may ulti-
mately want to frequent.
Sifting through the sites
Situations can and do change in the online poker world, so you
should think of the following list of sites as a cursory snapshot,
circa late 2004, rather than recommendations, endorsements, or
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
28
Bonus bonuses
To entice players to continue giving action, large sites occasionally offer existing
players a chance to get bonuses if they transfer fresh money to their accounts. The
terms tend to mirror initial sign-ups (20 percent with a cap), and the offers are def-
initely worth watching for. These bonuses nearly always correspond with promo-
tional events (winning a seat at the World Series of Poker Main Event, poker site
anniversaries, playing against super-models, and so on). You can always find the
offers in the regular site news that you receive for being a member.
If you play a site that tends to offer bonuses, you should never transfer funds until
you can get a matching amount of money (in the form of your bonus) from the site.
It may mean lying dormant for a week or two while you lie in wait for an offer, but
the cash reward is worth it.
Also (and especially if you have the money to spare), you should seriously consider
transferring bucks even if you have padded your account and you’re winning reg-
ularly. Keep an eye on your bonus standing, and after you receive your money, trans-
fer it all right back out so you can repeat the procedure for the next promotion.

criticisms. Anything and everything can change, so you should do
your own exploration and research to determine the current state
of online poker, using this list as a good starting point. (You can
always look at www.pokerpulse.com to determine the most popu-
lar sites at any given time.)
Without exception, every site provides Hold ’Em, Omaha, and
Seven-Card Stud as standard poker offerings. We note those with
more esoteric games.
PartyPoker.com (www.partypoker.com)
By sheer numbers, PartyPoker is the most popular Internet poker
site in the world. The site is always jumpin’, and the action in all
games (including Stud and Omaha) is lively. The bad news is that
PartyPoker struggles somewhat with its own success. In the past, it
wasn’t unusual to have the game servers go down, and players had
to deal with an annoying lag in the interface that made it hard to
get a seat at a table (by the time you clicked to sit, the table had
already filled). PartyPoker has worked to correct these problems,
and the situation today is better, although it still bears watching.
We find it kind of weird that it uses images of avatars (essentially
mannequin players) at its tables that never move; they look cool
for 10 minutes and then kind of bug us, so we turn those off when
we play. The interface hasn’t had any major changes in a few years,
and it now feels a bit tired. Right now PartyPoker seems to have
the easiest games to beat, but you should assume player quality
will increase (possibly dramatically) over time.
Ultimatebet.com (www.ultimatebet.com)
At one time Ultimatebet had the most advanced interface in online
poker — mostly from a pure presentation point of view — with 
the ability to switch out backgrounds for a slightly different per-
spective on the playing table (looking out from a player’s seat
rather than gazing straight down from the eye-in-the-sky). Although
the site is still interesting, others are beginning to narrow the 
cosmetic gap. Ulimatebet has a couple of new compelling features
as well. One is a sophisticated buddy list that provides instant
messaging — called UltimateBuddy — that lets you know when
your friends (and presumably enemies) are online or playing. The
other is an optional mini-view, which essentially reduces your table
to a line of little codified lights. We find the mini-view hard to use
and read, but the interesting concept may be improved upon over
time. Phil Hellmuth is one of the pros associated with this site; in
fact, you can sometimes play at a table with him (assuming you
don’t mind making a small donation, in the form of your stack, to
his poker prowess). Omaha action on this site tends to be strong,
and the site has recently started offering Pineapple, Double-Flop
Hold ’Em, and Triple-Draw Lowball (the only online place to 
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 29

practice for Red’s favorite obscure World Series of Poker event).
You can find out more about offbeat games in Chapter 7. Overall,
the play on this site tends to be very tough.
PokerStars.com (www.pokerstars.com)
PokerStars has an interesting claim to fame. The (James Bond cre-
ator) Ian Fleming-ly named Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 World
Series of Poker Main Event title by qualifying for the championship
via a PokerStars $40 buy-in tournament. The very next year, Greg
Raymer qualified on PokerStars and went on to win the same
WSOP championship. As a result, tournament players typically 
outnumber ring game players on the site 3-to-1. In our opinion, by
caliber of opponent, PokerStars tournaments are the toughest 
currently on the Net. If you can win tourneys here, you can win
anywhere. PokerStars also has the most Stud and Omaha action
outside of PartyPoker.
ParadisePoker.com (www.paradisepoker.com)
ParadisePoker used to be the granddaddy of poker on the Net, but
it was eclipsed when PartyPoker began advertising on the World
Poker Tour (the WPT no longer accepts site ads). The presentation
is slightly more interesting to look at (a paradise island theme)
than on many of its competitors’ sites, although we have had prob-
lems in the past with overlapping action buttons. You can almost
always find a good Seven-Card Stud or Omaha game, and occasion-
ally you can find Pineapple players. This may be the only site in
the world where you can play Five-Card Stud and Five-Card Draw
for hard currency. (See Chapter 7 for more on these games.) The
higher the limits, the tougher the competition on Paradise. We sug-
gest you stay away from the fixed-limit $10/$20 Hold ’Em games
(described by one accomplished poker player as “nightmarishly
difficult”).
Pacific Poker (www.888.com)
This site is a step down in size from the big boys; it typically
boasts about half as many players as the sites we previously list,
but hey, all you really need is one seat at a table with action, right?
Well, you can always find that here (unless you want to play Stud
or Omaha at odd hours). We like the clean presentation of the
interface, especially on the declaration of the winning hand. And
maybe it’s just us, but the players on this site seem a little friend-
lier than everywhere else.
GamesGrid (www.gamesgrid.com)
GamesGrid is the top skill-games-for-money site on the Net. It origi-
nally offered backgammon and gin rummy, and it recently added
poker to its stable. GamesGrid places an emphasis on the casual

player, including dealer’s choice and wild card games. Think
“Friday night poker, online.” GamesGrid has a lively social com-
munity and hosts a discussion page for this book that we both 
participate in at pokerbook.gamesgrid.com.
Getting Your Game Going
You know how to choose a good site after reading the previous
sections, so now the time has come to get down to the nitty-gritty
of setting-up.
Downloading software
Downloading your poker program (the client) is very straightfor-
ward. You go to the Web site of the place you want to play and
click on whatever super-obvious “DOWNLOAD NOW!” graphic it
has. Follow the directions and in somewhere between 2 (if you
have a broadband connection) and 20 (if you have a dial-up con-
nection) minutes, you can install and run the software. (For the 
differences between the poker client, the poker server, and the
poker Web site, see Chapter 1.)
Many installers for poker clients say something along the lines of
“quit all applications before downloading.” If you use a dial-up
Internet connection (such as AOL), don’t quit that application
because you won’t be able to download the client. You must have 
a connection to the Internet to be able to download. (This repre-
sents one of those rare situations where following instructions
actually doesn’t get you what you need.)
Logging in and starting up
After you install the client, click on the client icon to run it and get
started. Don’t be too surprised if the very first thing that happens,
after you connect, is that the site offers an upgrade to your client.
Sites upgrade their software often, sometimes more than once per
week, so the downloaded version may be a tiny bit behind the
latest and greatest offering. Although it may be annoying to go
through another lengthy download and upgrade process, the offer-
ings are the only way that some sites have of fixing problems and
getting you improved software.
If you ever receive an offer to upgrade your poker software, always
take it. Upgrades can contain bug fixes, feature enhancements, and
new bonus possibilities. You want ’em. Always.
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 31

You may be tempted to fill in bogus information when you create a
new poker account — especially if you only want to play there for
free chips. Don’t do it. Sites allow users only one account per site,
and the hassles of correcting some information can become monu-
mental. Poker providers can also be hyper-vigilant when it comes
to detecting unusual account behavior (they are, after all, trying to
ensure that everything stays on the up-and-up to protect all players’
accounts); you may get yourself banned from a site if you provide
faulty info.
When playing a site for hard currency, you should give as much
information to your poker host that you possibly can, including all
optional fields (phone number, for example). If something goes
wrong with your account, or your money in your account, you
want your host to be able to contact you.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
32
The bitter taste of Java
You may go to some poker Web sites that give you the option of playing poker imme-
diately, without even downloading their (optional) client. On the surface, playing
without using a poker client may seem like the thing to do, because you don’t have
to hassle with downloading and installing; unfortunately, the idea is only good in
theory.
If you can play poker without installing a client, you’re typically going to be using
Java (or sometimes Flash) protocols to play poker inside a Web browser window.
The first problem you may encounter is that you may not have the right version of
Java installed. Upgrading can be a long, slow process, and it may require that you
upgrade your Web browser.
Secondly, these programs come with a tremendous amount of overhead when com-
pared to installed clients, which results in a horrendously slow user experience. If
you do decide to play with a Java client, play will seem pokey slow (and if you’re an
Einsteinian physicist, you swear everything in your room is gaining mass). Even
“immediate” betting decisions can take 5 to 10 seconds.
If you’re playing on an installed client against someone else playing with a Java
client, you have to wait an undue amount of time whenever Mr. Java has to make a
betting decision. As if the situation wasn’t bad enough already, the Java-based
graphics are never as good as an installed client’s. They tend to be noticeably lower
resolution, making all the graphics look chunkier.
If you’re offered a chance to play instantly, pass and bite the downloading bullet
instead. You’ll be very glad you did. If you do play on a site where some players use
Java, and you find that waiting on their turns drives you crazy, pick up and move to
another site.

If you have the option of getting informational e-mails from your
poker host, take it. Site newsletters tell you about upcoming events
and tournaments, as well as frequent player and bonus promotions
you may be interested in. And don’t worry about poker sites sell-
ing your e-mail address so you receive tons of spam as a result:
Subscriber lists for online casinos are some of the most carefully
guarded in the computer world; sites never want to see you go
somewhere even remotely competitive.
Crafting your identity
The last task you need to complete before you begin playing in 
the computer realm is to make a few decisions about your online
persona.
What’s your name?
The site asks you for a user identification name (user ID). This is
the moniker (or if you’re of the CB persuasion, your handle) that
the site uses to identify you at the table. Unless you tell them, the
other players at any table can never know your “for real” human
name; nor can you know theirs.
After you pick a user ID, you’re stuck with it for the life of that site;
so make sure you pick something you like. Being called “Spice
Girls” may have been cool in 1997, but it isn’t so great now
(although, personally, we’d kill to have that one).
Expect obscene and semi-obscene user IDs to provoke a reaction
from your poker site’s Thought Police; you can avoid the hassle by
not goading them in the first place. Keep it clean cool guy.
What’s your sign?
Some sites give you the opportunity to pick a small thumbnail-
sized icon to represent your presence at the virtual table. Again,
choose something you can be happy with for a l-o-n-g time,
because some sites only let you change your icon once. Others
never do.
Regardless of your sex, you may be tempted to choose a picture
of some super-hunky dude or ultra-busty chick as your icon. We
encourage you to think twice about this tactic, unless you really
like the idea of talking about that image every time you sit down at
a table.
Chapter 2: Getting Online and Choosing a Site 33

People don’t have a whole lot to focus on when they sit at an
online table; you may find that some become obsessed with what
little eye candy they do see. We’ve met several players from the
virtual world who turned their chat off because they just couldn’t
take bantering about their picture any more.
You now have the tools to make an intelligent site choice, to get set
up, and to log on. Have fun.

Who is that old guy?
One time Red was playing at a table that was a real hoot; everyone was talking,
joking, and living it up, without a single bad attitude in the batch. (And to show you
how good it really was, everyone used the right version of the word “you’re.”)
One player’s comments clearly didn’t represent his septuagenarian icon; the big hint
being that not many 70-year-olds say, “Bag it, dude.”
Someone at the table asked, “Hey Leatherface, how old are you?”
“I’m 27.”
“I thought so, you didn’t sound old. Who is that old fellow in your pic? Your grandpa?”
“Nah. I just did a Web search for ‘old man’ and stuck the picture I liked best in
there.”
A unique approach if there ever was one.

 Jumping into the poker fray
 Talking cyber-poker slang
T
he online poker world is truly its own environment, with a
unique set of paradigms, customs, and standards. In this chap-
ter, we talk about the fundamental differences between online and
live players, take a tour of the cyber version of the table, and raise
your hip poker vocab with some Internetese (spoken with a dis-
tinctive poker accent, of course).
Comparing the Real World Game
to the Online Version
A few characteristics of the computer poker realm can be pretty
jarring when you first run across them. The most obvious exam-
ples: the speed of play, the type of opponent you encounter, and
the way your focus changes when you don’t have a real-world
poker-playing environment around you.

Considering the differences in speed
In a real-life cardroom, the physical manipulation of the cards (the
dealing and folding of hands) and the general orchestration of the
game (players placing blinds, taking seats, not paying attention to
the game, flirting with cocktail waitresses, and so on) take more
time than in the online world, which features automatic dealing,
immediately placed blinds, and a lack of drinks spilling on the felt.
Shuffling, dealing, and repeatedly asking slowpokes to hand in
their cards at the end of a hand burn time on the clock. In the
online world, these delays don’t exist.
How fast is online play? A typical brick-and-mortar cardroom, with
an efficient dealer and a full table, churns about 30 hands per hour
(add two or three more hands per hour if the dealers use auto-
matic shufflers); the online equivalent plays about 60 hands per
hour, increasing to 65 or more at turbo tables (see the section
“Going for super-speedy online play” later in this chapter for
more). After you gain experience and make it to a head’s-up match
against only one other player, you can expect that number to jump
to as high as a whopping 150 hands per hour! (For more on head’s-
up play, see Chapters 7 and 10.)
Because of the speed difference, you should play at limits about
half the amount you normally play in the real world until you get
used to it, even if you’re a seasoned brick-and-mortar player. (See
Chapter 8 for more on how to ease your way into the online world.
And in Chapter 6, we talk about watching the amount of time your
opponents take to play as a possible tell.)
Realizing the effects of faster play
The speed of the Internet impacts players in two ways. One is the
different feel. The first time you play online, the action and the
decisions can feel a little bit blurry. What’s funny, though, is that in
a short time you adjust to the new speed and you start to want to
go faster.
The other factor is that the greater number of hands acts as a multi-
plier. If you play with a losing strategy, or you play at a table where
better players outplay your strategy, you lose twice as much money
per hour. But if you win, you win twice as much per hour.
The way card houses make money is through the rake (taking a
very small percentage of every hand; see Chapter 1 for more on
the rake), so the faster they can cycle through a hand, the more
money they make. The house has no vested interest in the hand
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
36

itself; it just wants to see action taking place and games running
their course — as the players complete more games, the house
gets more money.
Beating the online timer
In the online world, you’re under a time clock for every betting
decision you have to make, which is somewhat similar to the shot
clock in basketball. The timing method varies from site to site, and
it depends on whether you play in ring games (cash games where
you can come and go) or tournaments. Some sites use a set
number of seconds per betting decision (usually between 15 and
30); others have a set number of seconds of total delay you’re
allowed at that table during a single session (usually 60). Reading a
site’s documentation or experimenting on a play money table can
familiarize you with an online site’s timing custom.
Until you get used to it, beating the timer can be psychologically
troubling. In fact, you may overreact by trying to decide too
quickly. Don’t be afraid to take all the time you need to act. Thirty
seconds is longer than you think.
Play with your computer’s volume turned on. All poker sites beep
when your turn to act comes, especially if you start to run short on
time. The alarm becomes especially useful when you want to work
within other applications on your computer, play on another table
simultaneously, or turn away from your machine for a few moments.
(Don’t get us wrong, we think playing distracted, especially by
playing another table, is a bad, bad thing. See Chapter 5 for how
shameful we think it all is.)
If your time limit expires and you haven’t yet made a betting deci-
sion, nearly all sites fold your hand (scant few automatically check
your hand if no previous betting action occurs in the seats before
you, folding your hand otherwise).
Going for super-speedy online play
As if the online game doesn’t move fast enough already, some sites
provide even faster play. Like crazed mechanics in a pit crew, they
shave the individual timing intervals down and use a few other
tricks and gimmicks to jack up the need for speed. These tables
always have augmented names like “Turbo,” “Speed Play,” or
“Make That a Triple Espresso.” If you’re new to the online environ-
ment, we don’t recommend playing on these tweaked tables. Wait
until you’re comfortable with online play first.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 37

Adjusting to a variety of opponents
In the real world, you know several things about your opponents
immediately. Some traits are (usually) obvious, such as their sex
and general age range. A few characteristics you may automatically
take for granted without even thinking about them, like what time
zone they play in. Others are subtle, like the ticks and tells some
people exhibit while they play (we talk about the online version of
tells in Chapter 6). But the online world is a different beast.
Analyzing your opponent
You play people not only in different time zones, but also very 
possibly in other countries. The Internet provides you, for the 
first time in your life, someone to play against in another place.
He may be in the middle of his day, or it may be smack dab in the
middle of his night. A tired player is always easier to beat than an
alert player.
Any tidbit of information can be valuable to you as the game pro-
gresses. For example, someone playing from the city that hosts
that day’s Super Bowl team may be watching the game while they
play on the laptop in front of the tube. Look for any edge you can
find, based on even the smallest of information threads, because
some edge is better than none; and in the online world, advantages
are harder to glean than in the brick-and-mortar environment. You
lose a lot by not having your opponent sitting at the table across
from you.
Not everyone you run across in the virtual cardroom speaks
English as a first language (you may also run into language barriers
in brick-and-mortar casinos); a few may not speak English at all.
Don’t worry; their money is good (and never forget, so is yours),
but you may not always get a snappy conversation.
On nearly all sites you can hover your cursor over an opponent’s
nameplate and find out his hometown, country of origin, or both.
Do so.
Betting more aggressively
We find that online players bet more aggressively than their offline
counterparts — especially in the smaller pot-limit and no-limit
games where a player can risk her chip stack at any point to gain
advantage in a hand. A generalization no doubt, but one that seems
to hold true. For more on different game types offered online (limit
versus no-limit, ring games versus tourneys), see Chapter 7.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
38

A few sites offer a bet the pot button as one of their options in the
betting round. In the real world, this action involves the player
estimating the current pot, counting out chips to match that pot,
placing that amount in front of her (possibly in multiple steps for
large bets), and then making the verbal bet; an arduous process
that often weeds out players trying to buy a pot (if for no other
reason than the player’s opponents can sit and watch her very
closely for tells as she goes through the motions). The wonderful
world of computers makes this process automatic, because it does
the counting and places the bet in one step. And automatic means
easy. And easy means more people use it more often than in the
real world.
You may also find that your online competitors are more willing to
push all-in compared to their felt-scraping equivalents. It becomes
much easier on the mind when you don’t have to physically see
the stack of chips, feel the stares upon you, and wrestle with the
enormity of the decision at the table environment. All it takes is a
simple flick of the no-limit button control for betting, and whoomp,
there it is.
Players betting all-in more often means that you see more variance
in the game than you’re probably used to in the real world. You’re
more likely to double your chip stack and more likely to go bust,
because the frequency of big betting is higher. This doesn’t mean
that you should alter your play or strategy, but you do have to pre-
pare yourself, or the frequency may shock you.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 39
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but Internet slurs can’t hurt me
Unfortunately, because they feel empowered in the somewhat anonymous online
environment, more rude opponents unleash their ugly behavior than in a brick-and-
mortar establishment, especially in the emotional aftermath of losing a big hand.
You should shrug off their vile comments or turn off the chat feature of your table if
their slings and arrows upset you. We suggest ignoring the behavior and looking
closely for patterns and tells that your opponent may unintentionally display.
Watch for them to go on tilt, which means they may become more aggressive and
stay in more pots because of their frustration.

Keeping your focus on the game
What you experience when you play online differs profoundly from
the environment during a real-world game. In the real world, your
senses experience an overload: The sights of the people and
events around you, the sounds of hundreds of clay poker chips
clacking together, the inevitable flickers of 20 televisions broad-
casting three different sports channels, the smells of a million
cigars past, and the tactile nature of the cards and the table all add
to your sensory perception of the game.
In the virtual world, your senses are strictly confined. The noises
you hear from the computer are unnecessary artifacts, or mimics,
of the real world. Noises like card shuffling, chips banging together,
and sound effects for checking and folding. But the site adds them
artificially; they don’t have to be there for the game to run properly.
Motion and visual information is extremely limited. The depriva-
tion of typical sights, sounds, and observations causes you to
focus much more intently on the few things you do see: the size of
a person’s bet, the amount of time he takes to make this bet, and
(to a much lesser extent) the conversation he has at the table
through the chat system (more about this in the section “Speaking
the Poker Dialect of Internetese” later in this chapter).
The more you force yourself to focus on these factors, the better
you can exploit them to your advantage. We get into this more in
Chapter 6. (Of course, we don’t think that the online world is nec-
essarily all focus — you are, after all, sitting in front of a computer.
We talk about avoiding your in-home distractions in Chapter 5.)
Getting a Feel for the 
Virtual Game
Many Web sites model their online poker tables after real-world
equivalents, and you may find them comfortably familiar if you’ve
spent some hours in brick-and-mortar cardrooms. Still, you should
pay attention to the details, particularly if home games, not casino
play, make up your past experience.
Figure 3-1 shows a fairly typical representation of a classic Internet
poker table. Most sites on the Net make their tables look some-
thing like this.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
40

Figure 3-1: A typical fixed-limit Hold ’Em Internet poker table.
The classic table closely mimics the real-world equivalent, and
first-time users shouldn’t have much trouble navigating and under-
standing the setup.
Unfortunately, mimicking the real world isn’t always the best way
to design the layout of a graphical computer program, nor is it nec-
essarily the easiest to quickly understand visually or use with a
mouse. These limitations have brought about a newer, modern
table (see Figure 3-2).
Laying it all on the table
Some features of the online table mirror the details of the brick-
and-mortar poker world, and others are unique to the Net. We
cover them all in this section to get you up to speed and ready to
hit the virtual felt with confidence.

The following list highlights the important terms you need to know
to get started (and you can check out Figures 3-1 and 3-2 for visual
images of the following features):
 Name placard: Shows the screen name of each player, how
much money the player has, and each player’s current status
(playing or sitting out). If no player occupies the seat, the site
marks it as open, and you merely click on the name placard to
sit down.
 Individual bet: Shown in front of a player’s seating position.
You can hover your cursor over the chip stack to see the
amount of the bet.

 Individual raise: Shown as a separate stack from the original
bet. You can hover over the raise with your cursor to see the
total amount.
 Pot: Shown in the middle of the table. You can see the size of
the pot by hovering your cursor over the chips in the middle.
 Action controls: You place a check, bet, raise, or fold by using
the action buttons. The buttons display the action for fast and
easy use.
 Betting slider: You can move this control to bet a variable
amount during no-limit play (see Figure 3-3). You can also type
the amount you want to raise in the corresponding text box.
 Community cards: Hold ’Em and Omaha flops, turns, and
rivers are shown in the middle of the table.
 Your hand: The site always shows your hand face up in front
of your name placard while you’re still in the pot. After you
fold, your hand disappears from the table.
 Your opponent’s hand: Shown face down until the showdown,
at which point the site turns the other player’s cards face up if
he beats you. If you beat your opponent’s hand, he typically
has the option of showing you what he had or mucking with-
out a display.
 Table discussion window: Shows all the dealer chat (like
what’s happening in the hand) interspersed with all the
player chat.
 Dealer chat control: Adjusts the chattiness of the dealer. You
can typically set the chat on three levels:
• Succinct: Essentially, who wins and loses the hand
• Normal: Information about the cards shown on the table,
along with the results of the hand
• Verbose: Tells you about everything you can see
On the classic table, you adjust verbosity with a pull-down
menu; on the modern table, you adjust it by clicking on the
little light menu and cycling through your choices (red for
succinct, yellow for normal, and green for verbose).
 Chat entry field: Where you type comments to other players
that show up in the table discussion window. The modern
design allows you to add smiley faces (geeks like us call them
emoticons).
 Chip addition: You click on the adding chips control button
on the modern table. On the classic table, you click on the
chip rack.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 43

 Dealer marker: Shows the last person to act and moves clock-
wise around the table at the end of every hand to signify the
dealer position.
In the online world, just as in a brick-and-mortar casino, the
house doesn’t participate in the game; it just provides a place
for you to play and takes a piece of the action in the form of
the rake.
 Sit out control: Any time you don’t want to be dealt a hand,
but you also don’t want to leave your seat, you use this
button. Sitting out is the polite thing to do if you need to take
a break from the game, because it keeps players from waiting
for you to act when you participate in other activities.
After you sit out (either by clicking the control or by timing
out), you have to click the “I’m back” button that appears. If
you sit out during a tournament, the site continues to post
your blinds on your turn.
 Current turn indicator: Shows you who acts next. On the
classic table, you may have trouble seeing this control,
although you always get sound indicating your turn to act. On
the modern table, the indicator is a light beam that sweeps
from player to player.
Acing the action controls
Action controls are unique to the online world, with no brick-and-
mortar equivalent. You click on these buttons to make your betting
decisions (check, bet, raise, or fold) associated with a hand.
Present action buttons
When the betting action comes to you, the screen presents you
with a set of present action buttons to choose from. Clicking one
indicates your betting decision at that point in the hand. If no bet-
ting action has come in front of you, you can check, bet, or fold
(nearly all sites remind you that you can check for free instead of
folding here), just as in a brick-and-mortar game.
If a player bets in front of you, you can call, raise (if further 
raises are allowed, meaning that the betting limit hasn’t been
reached), or fold. You can see examples of present action buttons
in Figures 3-1 and 3-2.
No-limit and pot-limit games also tend to have both a slider for
easy betting use (see Figure 3-3) and a text entry box for manual
betting for the particularly meticulous when you want to bet any
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
44

amount over the minimum. You can see a no-limit slider on the
modern table in Figure 3-2, and Figure 3-3 shows one from a classic
table. (Due to table layout styles, the classic slider is horizontal,
and the modern slider is vertical.)
Figure 3-3: A no-limit slider, which allows you to 
make a bet or raise above the minimum amount, 
from a classic Internet table.
After you make a present action choice, the site relays your deci-
sion to the other players at the table and the betting action passes
to the next player clockwise from your position, just as in the real
world.
Future action buttons
Before your turn to act arrives, if you already know what you want
to do based on a strategic choice or an obvious decision (and
assuming the betting situation doesn’t change), you have the
option of indicating your choice in advance. To do so, you use
future action buttons (see Figure 3-4). Using these buttons may go
against your instincts at first (because on a real-world table, the
rules state that you can’t act out of turn), but after a little experi-
ence they become second nature and certainly help to speed the
game along.
When you make a decision with a future action button, nothing
happens from the table’s perspective until the action comes to
you. The site automatically acts out your request, and you don’t
have a chance to interact with present action buttons. The betting
action moves along to the next person clockwise.
If you choose a future action that isn’t compatible with a subse-
quent play in front of you — say you choose to check but a bet
comes in front of you — the site erases your future action and
presents you with a set of present action buttons.
If you make a future action selection and someone increases the
bet in front of you (by placing a bet when everyone else checks or
by making a raise on a bet that a player previously made), the site
resets your choice as though you never made a selection. Now you
need to make another choice. This feature keeps you from making
involuntary raises or calls if your eyes wander off the screen.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 45

Unlike the present action buttons, you don’t have to make a future
action button selection. If you don’t select a future action button,
the present action buttons simply replace them when the action
comes to you.
If no players have raised, your future action choices are check, call,
raise, or fold. You also have the interesting option of “check/fold,”
which means you check if everyone else checks in front of you; but
if someone bets, you fold. Check/fold keeps you from having to select
the present folding action if you wanted to check a weak hand.
Figure 3-4: You use future action 
buttons to make your betting decisions 
instantaneous when your turn arrives.
Figure 3-4 shows future action choices that you find on the fixed-
limit version of any online game (a dollar amount of the bet normally
shows up on the bet button as well). Notice the gap in the future
action bar — this feature prevents you from trying to hit the check
button and accidentally raising if the betting status changes in front
of you (and therefore changing your future action button choices).
If a bet gets placed in front of you, your future action choices
change to call, raise, or fold. Checking goes away, of course,
because you can’t check when you face a bet (see Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5: Your future action buttons change 
if another player places a bet, giving you the 
option to call, raise, or fold ahead of time.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
46

Again, the dollar amount typically shows up on both the call and
the raise buttons. You can compare the future action buttons in
Figure 3-5 to the ones in Figure 3-4 to see how the design avoids
button overlap. (For more on button overlapping, read “The
dreaded overlapping action buttons” sidebar in this chapter and
check out Figures 3-6 and 3-7 for examples.)
Figure 3-6: If your site has overlapping action buttons, 
you may intend to click Check in Turn and instead click 
on Call when the site changes the buttons.
Figure 3-7: Here we see the new buttons that pop 
up after a site changes its action bar. This makes it 
quite easy to accidentally click on the wrong action button.
If you want to play no-limit, be very cautious about playing the
Check/Call Any future action button. If a player bets a large amount
in front of you, you may end up making a heftier call than you had
originally planned.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 47
The dreaded overlapping action buttons
Some sites have been a bit sloppy in the way they place their action buttons on the
screen, and occasionally you find future action buttons that the site, on your turn,
replaces with present action buttons that have a different intent in the same exact
area of the screen. You can start to click on one item and then have the buttons
switch out from under you, causing you to accidentally click on something else.
For example, before the action comes to you at the table, you may want to choose
to check in turn with a future action button. Unfortunately, when your turn comes,
clicking on that same exact screen location causes you to choose to call, thereby
putting your money in the pot when you didn’t intend to (and also possibly causing
you to put your fist through your computer screen when you didn’t intend to). A slow
movement on your part to click that check button may cause you to bet.
For this reason, you should always play for several minutes with play money on any
site you’re not familiar with before you play with hard currency to check for over-
lapping issues. If they arise, get out of dodge and choose another saloon.
Another way to dodge this overlapping button problem is to never use future action
buttons, if you can’t get away from your trusted dive.

Future action buttons can be a source of tells (possible indicators
of the strength of a player’s hand), both for you and your oppo-
nent. Read Chapter 6 for more on delving your opponents’ hands
as well as disguising your own.
Other action preferences
Some poker sites offer unique selections, usually in the form of
preferences, to help speed up play.
Auto post
The most common selection is Auto Post if you play Hold ’Em or
Omaha or Auto Ante if you play Seven-Card Stud. Choosing this fea-
ture automatically makes those pesky blind or ante housekeeping
bets for you and moves the game along. Your opponents can get
very cranky if you don’t auto-post, because you slow the general
action of the game, and for this reason alone you should check it.
(In tournaments, the sites make this choice for you automatically.)
If you choose to sit out and you enable the Auto Post feature, the
action automatically skips you without posting your blinds (except
in tournament situations, where you have to post).
If you’re playing Hold ’Em and you want to leave the table before
you’re in the big blind, you should uncheck the Auto Post button.
That way, when you need to post the big blind, the site prompts
you to place the blind manually instead of automatically dealing
you in the hand. At that point you can walk away cleanly without
playing yet another lap of a dealer marker (an orbit) around the
table.
Auto muck
You also have the option of choosing Auto Muck. Auto muck auto-
matically throws away (or mucks) any hand that doesn’t win a
given pot, speeding up the play.
With auto muck on, you typically can’t show any losing or winning
hand that goes uncalled. If you want to show any of your hands at
some point during your session, turn auto muck off. (See Chapter 6
for more on disguising yourself from your opponents.)
We both like to occasionally show our hands, especially when you
can gain a psychological advantage by doing so, so we rarely select
auto muck. Unfortunately, when you don’t check auto muck on
some sites, the site delays every hand to offer players the choice
to show or muck. Watching paint dry can be more exciting,
depending on the color.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
48

Playing Your First Hand
Enough with the gabbing already, start playing some cards! (See
Chapter 2 for how to choose a great site if you haven’t done so
already.)
Selecting your table and seat
The entry point for all poker sites is the home screen (many call
this the lobby — see Figure 3-8), which gives you a selection of
tables, games, and limits.
You can observe any table, so poke around a bit and watch a few
games being played at various stakes. When you take your first tour,
refrain from conversation, especially with people at the money
tables. Just observe. You only see the action buttons if you actually
play, but everything else, like the chips, the cards, and all the player
chat, you see in plain sight. Your objective here is to get a feel for
the way the online world looks and how it behaves. Just take it all in.
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 49
When to show Dumbino he got lucky
Sometimes showing your cards can benefit you as your game progresses. Here’s
such a case from a fixed-limit Hold ’Em hand.
You’re dealt Ah Kh, and you raise pre-flop. You get one caller: Dumbino in the big
blind.
The flop comes Qd Jd 10s.
Dumbino checks, and you bet your nut straight. Dumbino mulls it over and calls.
The turn is the 4c.
Dumbino checks again and quickly calls your subsequent bet.
The river is the 4h.
Dumbino checks. You bet. Dumbino raises. You suspect something fishy, so you
simply call.
The site flips over Dumbino’s hand. He holds 10d 4d for a full house, 10s over 4s. You
may want to voluntarily show your hand to let the table know you bet on both a good
starting hand and the nut hand. Your display can be useful the next time you make
bets and don’t have a great hand. The other players have to respect your previous
record of betting with great hands. Dumbino may not be so quick to call next time.
But if you have auto muck turned on here, you never get a chance to show.

Figure 3-8: The Internet poker home screen presents you with all your gaming
options.
Even if you’re an experienced online player, you should practice
with free chips for a bit on an unfamiliar site. It doesn’t cost 
anything to practice, and you get a chance to understand the 
idiosyncrasies of any given site’s interface. Any site offering games
for hard currency also offers games with free chips. To start your
practice, head to the site’s home screen.
Instead of standing and shivering on the diving board after you
finally decide to jump in, make sure to select a table that has sev-
eral players and an open seat for you. An open seat and willing
enemies ensures you some playing action.
Click on the seat that looks coziest at the table of your choice and
settle in. (This isn’t a big decision; all poker seats in the online
world are the same.) When you sit at the low-limit free tables,
expect the play to be very loose (with nonsensical, overly aggres-
sive, or atypical betting occurring with players who play every
hand). Don’t sweat it; you don’t play these tables to make money,
you play them to discover the online world.
Getting a feel for how 
everything works
Playing online is nearly automatic. Just sit back, relax (but pay
attention), and play the deserving hands the best you can. Don’t
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
50

worry about getting a handle on everything all at once; let the
game proceed at its own (what may at first appear to be frenetic)
pace.
It sounds dumb, but the best thing you can do for yourself, espe-
cially at first, is to focus on the game with as few other distractions
from the real world as possible. Turn off your television, put down
that chainsaw, have your roommate put the muffler back on his
low rider, and listen to the sounds of the game. Beeps, blats, and
flashing icons remind you when you need to act.
Become familiar with the pacing. Keep an eye on the conversations
and dealer chat in any text window giving you info, like when you
have the option to bet and when another player makes a raise.
These nuances can serve as the clues and hints to help you along
in your game. The site can’t tell you how to play better, but it does
tell you what to do and when.
Take your time to explore the interface. Every site has small differ-
ences and features, such as the location of control buttons it uses,
the way its chat mechanism works, and the controls you use to go
to the site’s home screen while you sit at a table. Play several
orbits of the dealer marker (one lap is called an orbit). Poke, pry,
and prod until you feel like you have a really good feel for what’s
going on. Play money tables really give you a good outlet for this
kind of exploration.
If something bugs you about the interaction of your particular site,
see if you can find a way to override it, and if you can’t, play some-
where else. Testing a site is just like test-driving a new car. If some-
thing bothers you a little bit now, you may be insanely chewing on
your keyboard in two months. Life’s too short, and your computer
is a bit too valuable, for that kind of aggravation.
Speaking the Poker Dialect 
of Internetese
If you use online instant messaging (IM), you’re familiar with some
of the shorthand abbreviations now prevalent in the Internet world
(for example, LOL means “laughing out loud”). Internet poker has
been around long enough to develop its own extensions to the
messaging lingo. Although you certainly aren’t required to speak
this language, it does make the game more enjoyable and at the
very least lets you know what people have to say about the poker
prowess of the table (including what they say about you).
Chapter 3: Putting Internet Poker’s Nuances to Work in Your Play 51

With the exception of referring to a card with capital letters

From a general decorum and demeanor point of view, the online
poker world is pretty similar to its brick-and-mortar equivalent.
You play with good guys and loud mouths, goofs and silent mum-
mies. Most people play online to kick back and unwind from their
otherwise glamorous lives. The anonymity of the Net does produce
a slight bit more aggression than you may otherwise find in the
physical world, so when you sit down, don’t wear your heart on
your sleeve.
If you’re playing at a table and an opponent takes an inordinately
long time to make a betting decision, it does no good to comment
on the fact. They have all the alerts and controls you do, and the
triple beep of the site’s “time’s up!” alert does a better job than 
any nagging you can throw in a chat window. The vast majority of
the time a delay like this happens, your opponent has connection
trouble, so the last thing he needs or wants is aggravation from
another player.
If a player’s repeated delays bother you (even if he can’t control
it), pick up and move to another table. That lowers your blood
pressure and keeps you on the karmic good side of the Internet
poker world.
Your general rule of conduct is simple: be congenial, be polite, or
be quiet. The guy who just beat your pocket aces with 2-9 off-suit
may also drive a Gremlin and listen to The Archie’s Greatest Hits
20 times a day, but you still shouldn’t launch into a tirade. The 
percentages are on your side in situations such as this one, but
percentages aren’t certainties; play enough hands and the player
with exactly one out (the only card that can help) will beat you
eventually.

Taking Your Cash to
Cyberspace — Safely
In This Chapter
 Touring the online money world
 Seeking a fair deal
 Moving your money
T
he scary (and sickly thrilling) truth about poker is that to 
win money, you gotta bet, and to bet, you gotta have cash.
Playing online is no exception — if you want to win cash that is.
The difference with playing online is you have to put your money
out “there” . . . which is a spooky commitment. You may feel a bit
queasy transferring money the first time; after all, you give your
bank account information to a poker room or a third-party trans-
ferring site. Before you get too worked up, grab a glass of ice water
and chill a bit; a couple of simple and prudent choices on your part
make this process quick, easy, and extremely low risk.
Transferring money only seems hard (and possibly risky to your
bank account) the first time you do it; after that, funding your fun
is a snap.
In this chapter, we explain how the money transaction process
works. We show you the various options you have and give you the
raw information you need to make a good choice when you decide
where to put your money.
Getting Familiar with Online
Betting, Payouts, and Losses
Unless you choose to send a check to an Internet poker room via
the old-fashioned post (see the next section for info on this and
other methods), you use a third party to transfer money from your

bank to the poker room. These third parties act as nothing more
than a holding pen for your loose cash until you can herd it along
to the online poker room of your choice. Online cardroom hosts
don’t want to be in the banking business, and they actually prefer
not taking your money directly — they want to orchestrate your
poker game and leave the funding business to someone else. It may
seem like a hassle for you, but a nice side effect of the process is
that online holding companies provide you with an extra level of
security, because your online poker room never deals with your
bank directly. One level of indirection between your real world
funds and your potential Net poker palace is just another precau-
tion that should make your poker experiences worry-free.
If you’ve ever used PayPal for an online transaction (like paying for
a pair of fuzzy rabbit slippers you won in an online auction), you’re
familiar with the way third-party online holding companies work.
The intermediaries you use for online poker operate the same way
PayPal does for eBay. But PayPal made the decision a couple of
years ago to drop support for online gambling (including poker),
so you can’t use the company specifically, but you can use other
companies that perform the same service.
Looking at your money 
transfer options
You have several choices for getting your money to the Internet
poker room of your choice.
Every online poker room supports a slightly different set of trans-
action methods and specific operators for each method of transfer
you can use. The cashier on any given site always tells you the
providers and methods the site supports.
Mailing a check
The postal system is the most old-fashioned and lowest-tech way
you can move your money. Get a cashier’s check or a money order
(almost never a personal check) and send it via the real-human-
carried postal service to the poker room of your choice. Live mail
is also the slowest method due to the usual postal and check-
clearing delays (slowest only because the Pony Express is no
longer available as a delivery technique). Online casinos are grow-
ing weary of this method because of general real-world processing
hassles, and this option may soon follow the ponies off into the
sunset.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
56

Sending an electronic check (ACH)
Many sites accept ACH (bank-speak for electronic checks). You pro-
vide all your checking account information with a firm that holds
your money to play (Citadel, for example), provide the information
on the online site where you want to play poker, and “write” your
ACH. Basically what that means is you deposit a certain amount of
money with the poker site cashier, which then sends you on to the
firm holding your money, where you’re asked to verify your pass-
word, confirm the dollar amount you want to deposit, and provide
a blank check number. Your check goes through, and you’re sent
back to your poker site to start play. ACH transactions are typically
instantaneous, but they may come with a small fee (usually a buck
or two). All banks allow ACH transactions.
You have to give every ACH a number, just like the number you
find on the upper right-hand corner of your paper checks. Make
certain you don’t write in a number that you may eventually use
from your paper checks. Pick a number far beyond your check
series (20,000 more than where you are now, for example) or use
the very next number in your checkbook and then destroy the real-
world check with the same number. Don’t forget to record your
transaction in your checkbook. If you do use the same number,
your bank denies the second check, and you must pay all the hefty
charges associated with a quick visit to Rubber Check Land.
Transferring money via an online holding company
You transfer money from your bank account to this trusted third
party that makes it available for deposit to the Internet poker room
of your choice. The most common technique is to transfer into the
online holding company via electronic check, but some companies
accept bank wires or a credit card.
To use this method, you have to set up an account with the online
holding company in question. You typically give it your checking
account information; the site deposits a few cents to your checking
account (what we call the tickle); you verify that you receive it; and
then you’re set to go. Initial account set-up and verification can
take as long as a week.
Always be aware of any fees these holding companies may charge
you over and above the handling fees that your poker site charges.
Wiring money with Western Union
Yes, that Western Union. You give the company your credit card or
debit card information, as well as information about the Internet
poker room you want to engage, and you’re set. The Five Americans
may have liked Western Union in their song of the ’60s, but we’re
Chapter 4: Taking Your Cash to Cyberspace — Safely 57

not so keen on the company now because of the stiff fees it charges.
As of late 2004, the company commonly charged $15 for a $100
transfer. Say what?
Charging with credit cards and debit cards
Most poker sites show that they accept payments from MasterCard
and Visa, and because credit cards already have a certain amount
of security built-in (not to mention no transaction fee), this seems
like a natural way to go. Unfortunately, transferring your money via
a credit card turns out to be difficult because credit card compa-
nies are finding ways to make it harder to play (and pay) with their
money.
A few years ago, some credit card companies were sued because
they refused to dole out money for cardholders who had run up
online gambling debts. Naturally, the credit card companies have
recoiled. But MasterCard is pressuring its member banks to drop
support of transactions involving Internet gambling (including
poker), and to the best of our knowledge, no one has been able to
transfer money with this method in a long time. Visa is also clamp-
ing down by denying the vast majority of cardholders trying to
deposit through the company.
We do have a few pals, however, who have had luck depositing
with credit card-emblazoned debit cards — particularly those with
the Visa logo. Not all (probably not the vast majority) work, but it
may be worth a shot. If you try plastic, you have nothing to lose
(this attempt is as safe as any other credit card transaction online,
and you don’t incur a penalty for denial). Just don’t expect it to
work.
If the card company does reject you, don’t wig out if you get a con-
fusing, complex, or flat-out wrong message back, such as “account
denied” or “insufficient funds.” The credit card side of the transac-
tion (versus the poker room side) is denying you because it doesn’t
accept online gaming transactions. In turn, the site hands you
some random error message to explain the denial. If this happens,
check out another method in this chapter that actually works.
Paying with phone cards
You may want to explore versions of phone cards that you can
“charge” with dollar credits online and then transfer the balance to
an online poker room. Phone cards in name only, these money ves-
sels actually behave almost precisely akin to pre-paid debit cards.
You can usually find out if your poker site supports these cards
through the cashier. From there, you can click through to set up an
account that funds the card, using your credit or debit card to pay
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
58

for the transaction. Cards generally come in set amounts — $100,
$200, and up — and you typically get a 7 percent (or so) transac-
tion fee tacked on to your cost. This option seems to be gaining in
popularity, mostly because of its convenience.
Considering transaction fees
Not all transactions are equal; at least not relative to the transac-
tion fees the online cardroom of your choice charges you. The
cashier section of all Internet poker rooms clearly marks the trans-
action fees associated with any given method of transferring
money. Unless you have a good reason, pick a method with no, or
very minimal, transaction fees.
Sites that charge a fee are almost always passing along the fees
that third parties charge them (unless they want to offset other
banking-related expenses). From your point of view, however, the
charge comes from the site.
Many sites label transfer techniques with a gimmick along the lines
of, “No fee — limited time promotion.” Although some sites have
tagged specific transaction methods this way for years, don’t be
lulled into complacency. When you transfer more cash to or from a
site, check to see what fee the site associates with that particular
transfer — the transaction fees associated with your money trans-
actions can change at any time.
Because transferring money is usually a multi-step process, you
should be aware that each step may have associated transaction
fees. Make sure to examine the fee schedule your online poker site
posts, as well as the fees it may charge for moving your money into
the intermediate processing service.
Chapter 4: Taking Your Cash to Cyberspace — Safely 59
Online poker: Where the dollar is king
In the online poker world, the U.S. dollar rules all. All deposits, all withdrawals, and
all bonuses come in good old American greenbacks.
You may run across sites that allow you to play at a table with euros or pounds (the
sites automatically convert from dollars for you), but the vast majority of your table
stakes involve dollars. Such a nice convenience when you consider that the servers
you play on are located outside of the United States. (American regulations require
all gaming sites to be physically located outside the boundaries of the United States.)
If only you had a way to send a postcard back home . . .

Identifying Honest “Banks”
When you use an online holding company, you essentially establish
a bank account online — a cyber version of real-world cash. Make
no mistake; you play with hard currency. When you transfer $20
from your checking account to an online holding company, that
money is gone, gone, gone from your account. Yes, you still have
the funds under your name, but the actual dollars are now under
the reign of your online holding company. For this reason, you
need to pick a good one; fortunately, it’s not hard to do.
Potential risks versus reality
On the surface, the online holding company business may feel
pretty shaky. You use an unfamiliar company, it gets your banking
information, and due to American gaming regulations, its head-
quarters are outside the bounds of the United States. Sounds like a
recipe for disaster.
The fact of the matter is that these companies simply fulfill a serv-
ice. Putting aside all the whizzy new terminology, the underlying
model is very familiar: You put up your money; you have an
account; your account has a balance; and you can deposit and
withdraw (24 hours a day) your money over the Internet.
Like any online banking activity, you must guard your password
and account access information.

How online holding companies 
make their dough
When PayPal announced that it wouldn’t continue to handle online gambling, a
multi-million dollar industry was left in the breach, and multi-million dollar indus-
tries don’t lie in breaches for very long.
Companies quickly filled the gap to scoop up the oodles of money. Not only do they
get transaction fees (if they charge them; right now most don’t), but they also get
what bankers call the float. You don’t receive interest when your money sits with
an online holding company, but it does on the float. And holding companies do
charge transaction fees to your cyber poker rooms. So if you put enough transac-
tion fees together and add in the float, you have the makings of some serious cash.

As with the online cardrooms, providing you with honest, straight-
forward, and direct service is in the holding company’s best 
interests.
With any financial transaction, you always take a certain amount of
risk (consider when you send a credit card away with your server
in a restaurant), but as long as you stick to known entities and use
prudence, the risk you take is extremely small.
Managing your online money
You can take several steps with your online funds to shave any risk
level to practically nil:
 Make as few transactions as possible. The fewer times you
make a transaction, the less chance you take for something to
go wrong. Move $200 once rather than $100 twice, which may
be less expensive fee-wise, too.
 Along with your minimalist transaction policy, you should
move as little money as possible. The less you bestow upon
an online holding company, the less you have to worry about
problems of some type suddenly cropping up. So in line with
the info in the previous bullet, move $200 instead of $1,000.
 Use a known online holding company. By this we mean a com-
pany that multiple online poker sites utilize. (We recommend
a few in the upcoming section “Methods and providers we
like.”) This route practically guarantees that you don’t use a
fly-by-night operation.
 Don’t send a check directly to an online poker room; a lost
check is much harder to track. Plus, when you involve a third
party (like an online holding company) you get an extra set of
transaction records. (“Look here, you poker room knotheads:
Online Holding Company X transferred $50 to you on the first
of the month. Now what do you have to say?”)
 Password protect your computer. Remember, your PC is now
the official home of some of your hard currency. You don’t
want anyone to be able to squander it. As always, squandering
your money is a privilege that you should reserve for yourself.
Methods and providers we like
We must stress that we neither endorse nor recommend the follow-
ing techniques and companies. We only know that the following
options and providers have worked cleanly and smoothly for our
online poker transfers, as well as for many of our pals.
Chapter 4: Taking Your Cash to Cyberspace — Safely 61

Transferring via electronic check (ACH)
For ACH transactions, we have no problems with Citadel Commerce
(www.citadelcommerce.com). It charges a small service fee, but
the transaction is nearly instantaneous.
Using online holding companies
We use and like NETeller and FirePay. You should feel especially
safe knowing that NETeller is a publicly traded company on the
London Stock Exchange. Expect a delay, possibly as long as a week,
when you first set up your account, but after you establish a veri-
fied line to your bank account, money transfer becomes smoother.
NETeller has a service charge on instantaneous transfers, but you
can take the week-long route for free. As of late 2004, FirePay didn’t
have a service charge, but don’t count on that lasting forever.

62
Psst . . . what’s the password?
With anything you access electronically, you want to choose a secure password
that outsiders can’t easily guess. In fact, many online banking services require that
you meet certain formatting criteria, such as a minimum number of characters or
having both letters and numbers in your password. Picking a tough password is
good because it protects your cyber valuables.
The downside is that you have a harder time remembering them. Many people use
the same password for every sensitive online site, or they write the passwords
down, often in a text file on the computer. Both of these copouts are bad news. If you
use the same password everywhere and someone discovers it, that person has
access to all your accounts. If you store your passwords on your computer and a
thief steals it (or it simply needs repairs), the crook has all your software and the
passwords he needs, right in one convenient place.
How do you pick different, secure passwords that you can remember?
Our advice is to choose a process that you apply to a few memorable words, and
then select words that only make sense together to you.
For example, Jennifer, a compulsive seamstress, needs a password. Remembering
she once sewed some curtains for her aunt Liz in Auburn, she starts with the words
“curtain” and “Auburn.” For a process, she reverses the letters in one word and
converts the other to digits based on the numbers on a telephone keypad. The
resulting password, niatruc282876, is very hard to guess.
She can use a different project/city combination, but the same process works every
time she needs a new password. And on the freak chance Johnny Hacker does
figure out one of her passwords, it doesn’t help him figure out any others she uses.
If Jen needs a password reminder, she simply writes down her aunt’s name.

Transferring Money
The tables are waitin’. Time to take a big swallow and move some
of your funds.
Walking through your deposit
The deposit process breaks into clumps with a few possible points
where you have to just . . . wait. Be patient and begin the process
with the following steps:
1. Pick a quality online poker room.
See Chapter 2 for information on how to choose a site.
2. Select your transfer method of choice from the online
poker room’s cashier.
3. If the transfer method involves a third party (meaning
any method that doesn’t send your online poker room a
real-life paper check), go to the third party’s Web site and
register appropriately.
Make sure to follow the site’s directions for account cre-
ation and verification to the letter. (If you send a check
straight to the online poker site, skip to Step 9.)
At this point you may encounter a time lag. If you use an
online holding company, its tickle (the amount the com-
pany initially puts toward your account to make sure it has
the correct bank info) and your verification of the account
balance could take as long as a week.
4. Check your online poker room for first-time bonuses.
Weigh this figure against how much you’re willing to use
as a poker stake and determine the amount you want to
deposit into your online poker account.
Many sites give you bonus money to play with for making
their site your room of choice. For more details on sign-up
bonuses, see Chapter 2.
5. Transfer the necessary funds from your real-world
account (checking account or debit card) to your 
online third party (the ACH provider or online holding
company).
Don’t forget to move enough money to account for any serv-
ice fees that the poker site or holding company charges you
along the way. You may experience a delay of a day or two
as your funds seep from one account to the next.
Chapter 4: Taking Your Cash to Cyberspace — Safely 63

6. Verify that your online third party deposits the correct
amount of money and that your real-world account
reflects the withdrawal properly.
An error anywhere in this entire process is unlikely; but if
one occurs, it may be something like a double withdrawal.
7. Make the deposit to your online poker room from your
third party.
This action is typically instantaneous, but you may experi-
ence a lag period of a day.
8. Read the confirmation dialogs of your poker room care-
fully to see how soon you can expect the deposit to 
show up.
9. Verify that you receive the funds in your online poker
room in the expected time frame.
10. Verify with your online third party that it has withdrawn
the proper amount of cash relative to your poker room
deposit.
11. Play online poker shrewdly.
12. Play in a promotional event that wins you a seat in the
World Series of Poker. (Optional)
13. Win the World Series of Poker in the brick-and-mortar
world. (Optional)
14. Buy us each a lobster dinner and let us fondle your
World Series winner’s bracelet. (Not optional if you made
it this far.)
The list may look daunting and vague, but the process is practi-
cally automatic, although it varies slightly depending on which site
you head to. All it really takes is money and a little patience. After
you complete your first transfer and become comfortable with a
certain method and provider, the rest of your transactions go
much faster.
If at any point your money transaction looks suspicious or just
plain wrong, contact your transferring parties immediately. The
best way to communicate is by e-mail (so you have a verifiable
trail), and anytime you have a phone conversation, be sure to
follow up with an e-mail recap.
As you make transactions (or dispute transaction errors), be sure
to take notes — and save them. This helps you keep track of all
details — dates, times, and the names of people you speak with as
you go along.
Part I: Internet Poker Basics 
64

Keep a separate record of all your online poker room deposits —
not only to follow your deposits and withdrawals in the real world,
but also to track whether you win or lose money over the long run.
Going the other way: Cashing out
Like you may expect, cashing out of your online poker room 
is a tiny bit harder than cashing in. Different sites have different
rules — all plainly discussed in the withdrawal section of your
poker room’s cashier — but here are a few universal snags to 
lookout for:
 Withdrawals often have to take place at least 48 hours after
the last deposit.
 If you want your online poker room to cut you a check, expect
a $50 minimum withdrawal and a 15-day wait.
 Online poker rooms tend to prefer paying back via online
holding companies. You may have to endure a delay of a day
or two during this transfer. Online holding companies, in turn,
may delay you a day or two as well before they process the
funds and send them back to you.
 Read details of any bonus you want to receive. Typically 
you can’t withdraw a chunk of cash and then immediately 
re-deposit it to score a bonus. (See Chapter 2 for more details
on bonuses.)
In short, if you need money out of your poker account, anticipate a
delay. Don’t turn to this account when you need money to buy a
fire extinguisher at the very moment your house is burning down.

 Adjusting to money that feels fake
 Warming up to lower betting limits
 Minimizing your distractions
 Readying your computing environment
 Sharpening your mental game
O
n your first pass, the online poker world may seem to be
nothing more than a dim shadow of the real-world brick-
and-mortar equivalent. If you can’t see the face of your opponent
sitting across the table from you, what’s the point?
After you dig under the surface a bit, however, you discover that
online poker is profoundly different in some very interesting ways.
Psychologically, you experience a very different game: You see 
far more hands than in the brick-and-mortar world, you play with
money that may seem fake (oh, but it won’t for long), and because
everything happens on a computer, you encounter a whole new set
of ways for things to go wrong.
In this chapter, we cover some of the fundamental underpinnings
of online poker — characteristics that make it truly different from
the brick-and-mortar world — and we look at ways to understand
and deal with them.

Grappling with the Psychological
Basics
From a psychological point of view, the biggest differences between
online play and the brick-and-mortar world include the radical
increase in the speed of play and a heavy (mental) disassociation
from the money you put in play.
Understanding the ramifications 
of speed
In the online world, you have a chance to play between two and
three times as many hands per hour as you get in the normal brick-
and-mortar environment. Online poker rooms do everything in
their power to accelerate play, resulting in some interesting (and
sometimes odd) ramifications in the way a player perceives the
game.
Coming to grips with quick-hitting bad draws
Probably the biggest psychological hardship for any poker player
is the bad beat, a situation where you have a better hand than
another player during the first couple betting rounds, but your
opponent draws a long-shot card and beats you toward the end of
the hand. A lesser hand outdrawing you is a hard thing to take
under any circumstance.
As you play online, it may seem like you see more bad beats than
you do in the real world, and guess what? You do. Because you see
two or three times as many hands, you also see two to three times
as many bad beats. You see all types of hands more often. You
need to keep a realistic perspective, because if you focus solely on
the bad beats, you slowly drive yourself crazy. But if you can bal-
ance the bad-beat blues with the realization of how many more
winning hands you see and have, you can hang on to your sanity.
If you play and discover that bad beats really stick with you, that
you truly can’t shrug them off for the statistical anomalies they
are, you definitely shouldn’t play no-limit. No-limit is the cardroom
equivalent of performing circus acts without a safety net — the
trick isn’t any harder, the penalty is just more severe. An unfriendly
card can cost you a significant amount of money or your chip posi-
tion in a hard-fought tournament.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
70

Of course, the torturous part of fixed-limit is that more opponents
hold out (sometimes justifiably) for underdog draws because of
the cheaper price, and as a result, you actually see more bad beats
in the limit games. If taking a bad beat in no-limit is like taking a
sword through your midsection, losing with bad beats in fixed-limit
is like getting 1,000 papercuts. (For details on the bankrolls you
need to withstand bad beats, head to Chapter 8.)
Celebrating the micro-second win
Along with moving past the increase in bad beats of the Net (see
the previous section for advice), you have to psychologically
adjust to the wins also coming far more quickly. If you catch a
really big hand or have a very unusual sequence of cards hit the
board, baddabing, baddaboom: The screen displays the hands still
in play, the site pays out the pot, and the play continues with new
cards. You may have played your entire life waiting for a royal flush

In 2004, he had a string of not one, not two, but 27 consecutive finishes out of the
money (meaning he busted out early before the prize money kicked in). In 25 of these
27 tournaments, other players eliminated him with all-in plays where Red was 
the favorite. Red had the best hand going in; he just didn’t have the best hand 
coming out.
Disheartening? Sure. Especially if, like him, you have an over-analyzing mind and a
degree in mathematics.
Runs of this nature are a fluke, but not impossible. What you need to do if a streak
like this ever takes hold (and if you play long enough, a similar streak will come) is
to keep your wits about you and don’t let the statistical weirdness of the past affect
your play in the present. Take time off, because you need to adjust, re-coup, and re-
finance. And make certain that you just ran into bad luck and didn’t expose some
fundamental flaw in your poker strategy. Think back to what you thought before your
plays, the time you took betting, and your betting strategy to search for a pattern.
But what about Red’s bank account? Well, his 28th tournament began a string of six
tourney wins, completely reversing his debt. (Now he could call that a statistical
anomaly, but he prefers to call it the consequence of his cunning skill.)

and then, when it finally hits your Seven-Card Stud hand in the
online world, the site treats it with exactly the same dignity and

Getting used to money that 
doesn’t feel real
One of the biggest dangers to your bankroll during online play is
the fact that your money doesn’t seem real. You may face this
problem in the brick-and-mortar world when you look at a stack of

Dealing with bad beat whiners
You can’t find an Internet poker room where players don’t type a phrase like, 
“This never happens in the real world!” every second. The fact of the matter is, yes,
bad beats do happen in the real world. When the randomness comes out of a com-
puter rather than a dealer’s ring-laden hand, the whole process just seems more
suspicious.
And the online world seems to have a disproportionate number of people who com-
plain, and then keep complaining, about their bad beats. Part of it, no doubt, is due
to the anonymity of the Internet; people can whine without really losing face. Some
of it probably has to do with the number of bad beats that any given person sees.
And a few whiners may be people who don’t have much raw playing experience, so
they taste the bitter end of the bargain for the first time. For this reason, the whin-
ing seems to be the shrillest at the lower-limit tables and lowered to a soft murmur
at the higher limits.
In any event, it pays to be psychologically braced for opponents who take a bad
beat and suddenly lose it. They may even rattle on and on, after being eliminated
from a tournament, as an observer.
As a player you have a couple of choices. One is to ignore your table’s version of
Mount Vesuvius and wait for the eruption to cease. Cover the fan vent of your com-
puter to keep any ash from coming out. If you need help focusing, always remem-
ber that you can turn off player or observer chat.
If the whiners get threatening or abusive, you can also report them to your site’s
support personnel for corrective action. Nobody needs to hear that kind of stuff, so
you do all players a favor.
The one thing you shouldn’t do is engage the hothead in baiting conversation, no
matter how tempting it may be. If the site does decide to levy ramifications on the
jerk, you don’t want to be associated as an instigator or accomplice.

chips, but the online world amplifies it by an order of magnitude
when you stare at a number on the screen that represents your
bank account. You can’t see it, smell it, touch it, or listen to it 
crinkle between your fingertips, and if it didn’t show up as a with-
drawal on your checking account statement last month, you may
not have even remembered it was yours.
As a result, you can easily become lax about money: lose 5 bucks
here, 20 bucks there. Who cares? It doesn’t really matter. But it
does matter. A lot. You work hard for your money, even (maybe
especially) if you win it at the poker table. If you ever find yourself
playing nonchalantly or, worse, thinking you want to just lose
money so you can close an account (sounds weird, we know, but
we have friends who’ve done it), you need to stop and seriously
consider your situation.
If you find yourself behaving like the money doesn’t matter, check
your pulse and back away from playing. In fact, you should seri-
ously think about completely withdrawing the money from your
account and then restarting in a week or so, if you feel up to it.
Closing your account is very simple. You go to the cashier and go
through the equivalent of clicking the “I want all my money now”
button. Some sites require a minimum withdrawal, but if you want
to close your account for good, the sites nearly always waive that
requirement. If you want to close an account that contains less
than the minimum withdrawal amount, contact your site’s cus-
tomer support service.

Play to win — and keep track 
when you do
When you begin playing online for the first time, you should work up to limits that
measure about half the size of what you ultimately want to play and stay there until
you get comfortable and can regularly beat the game. Keep close track of your wins
and losses; advance no further until you have a certifiable winning record.
Remember, whatever you lose at your current level is doubled on the next. Never,
ever, move up to a higher level with the idea that you can recover your losses faster.
When losing, the best way to recover is to move down in limits, not up. The com-
petition isn’t as stiff and the decisions you make are purer because they don’t have
as much riding on them, leaving you less worried about your monetary risk.

Examining the Limit 
Differences Online
The games that truly set online play apart from brick-and-mortar
play are micro-limit matches (games with $1/$2 limits and below)
and no-limit (or pot-limit — we lump both together throughout the
chapter) ring games.
When you play lower-limit games online — especially the 
micro-limits — you’re still playing serious poker. In the real world,
micro-limits are often taken lightly — friends and neighbors play
for fun and use the same pennies that always go back in the com-
munity jar anyway. The skill level contrast is but one symptom
of the difference between serious online money players and fun-
loving home-gamers. And don’t even ask about micro-limit games
in cardroom establishments.
No-limit games are different primarily due to the frequency of large
bets. More people are willing to click a mouse to risk it all on draws
or good hands than you find willing to push clay chips across the
felt while staring an enemy directly in the eye.
To understand the online mutations of the micro-limit and no-limit
forms of poker, read on.
Looking closely at micro-limits
In brick-and-mortar cardrooms, the lowest fixed-limit games you
can find are $1/$2 Hold ’Em, $2/$4 Omaha, and maybe $1/$2 Stud.
In the online world, however, the limits go right on down to $0.02/
$0.04 for Hold ’Em and Omaha and around $0.04/$0.08 for Stud.
The average player can take his lowest brick-and-mortar buy-in
and get about 50 times as much action online, making the Internet
a great place to learn and master any game — without the threat of
losing much money.
Knowing your competition
Don’t be misled by the low stakes. Yes, beginners do play at the
low stakes tables (and if you’re a beginner, we strongly encourage
you to start on these limits), but you shouldn’t mistake online
micro-limit games for the carefree penny ante games you may have
played in junior high school.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
74

The competition on these tables is tougher and more advanced
than in the games you grew up on. For starters, everyone you play
against is, in theory, at least 18 (because you can’t see your oppo-
nents it may be hard to remember that sometimes), and the maturity
of players makes a difference.
Along with the beginners, you may encounter a few seasoned 
players who read new poker texts and want to try out ideas and
theories. Some veteran players are just now reading their first
books after having grinded for years in the school of hard knocks.
Those seasoned card-slingers still know how to take you down,
new theories or not. Other players go to the lower limits purely as
a fundraising source for paying their entry fees at the higher-limit
tables. And all these gamblers can be formidable opponents.
Your favorite opponents, of course, are the ones who don’t really
care what happens to their money. They log-on for the entertain-
ment. But the fun-seekers make up the minority. Most online players
are more serious about the game than other micro-limit players
you take on in home games.
We don’t mean that playing micro-limit poker is the equivalent of
walking down a dark alley in the worst part of town with a dollar
bill sticking out of your pocket. You’re not going to get clubbed for
it. But you should always remember that your money is someone
else’s potential prize. (See “Grappling with the Psychological
Basics” earlier in this chapter for more about the psychology of
playing with online money that doesn’t feel real.)
Changing your strategy — or not
Strategically, you want to approach micro-limit games the same
way you approach their larger-staked siblings. When you take a
seat at one of these tables, be prepared to play a solid game of
poker. Don’t stay in with substandard cards or unlikely drawing
hands “because it’s cheap.” You can develop bad habits that carry
over to the more treacherous stakes.
Instead, take the time after you fold shoddy hands to observe your
opponents, figure out who plays loose or tight, and adjust your
play accordingly. Those pennies and dollars start to add up over
time, and you should start moving up in limits after you regularly
beat the micro-limit games, which shouldn’t take too long. If you
don’t underestimate your opponents and play a solid game, these
limits are definitely beatable.
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 75

Pondering the no-limit/
pot-limit differences
In the variable betting world, you often play Omaha as a pot-limit
game and Hold ’Em as a no-limit game (rarely as pot-limit). (Seven-
Card Stud is always played fixed-limit — for more on the different
types and limits of games offered online, see Chapter 7.) The bet-
ting limits cross over both game-type sub-species: tournaments
and ring games. You see pot-limit Omaha tournaments and no-limit
Hold ’Em tournaments just as often as you see pot-limit Omaha ring
games and no-limit Hold ’Em ring games. And both have distinct
differences and flavors when compared to their brick-and-mortar
counterparts.
Experiencing no-limit/pot-limit tourneys online
Unless you come from a very sophisticated home game, have par-
ticipated in a neighborhood-organized tournament with friends, or
have a fair amount of cardroom tournament experience, you’ll
likely get your first exposure to no-limit poker tournaments in the
online world. The boom in poker popularity, driven by endless 
televised tournaments, has created legions of nearly frantic poker
zombies wanting to risk it all in the same tournament settings they
see on TV.
No-limit and pot-limit tournaments are the battlegrounds where
these zombies feed. And no wonder. Tournaments are an easy and
attractive choice for anyone, because for as little as $5, you can get
a stack of around $1,000 in online chips. In exchange for cash, even
the most meager and timid person gets a chance to become a
fierce road gambler and join the ranks of the ruthless super-rich —
betting thousands on a single hand and hammering away at every-
one else in a winner-take-all format. (Chapter 10 has more on 
tournaments in general, and Chapters 12 and 13 drill deep into
the single-table version.)
Rushing all-in
If you have experience in no-limit tournaments in the brick-and-
mortar world, keep smelling salts by your computer and prepare
to be shocked by the raw number of times you see people push all-
in. The frequency of all-in pushing is far higher in the online world.
The lower the table entry fee, the worse the all-in frenzy gets. Free-
roll tournaments (which we discuss in Chapter 10) are especially
riddled with loose cannons, and these tourneys are unrealistic
enough that they border on being nothing more than bad sitcoms
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
76

for the first few rounds. Even at medium hard-currency limits (say,
$30 buy-in tourneys), the all-in-push is probably one and a half
times what you see in the brick-and-mortar world.
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 77
Loose cannons in Hold ’Em and Omaha
You’re in the early stages of a no-limit Hold ’Em tournament, and everyone holds
roughly the same chip stack size. You receive A-K as your hole cards for a hand.
You bet and get raised from behind by Nice Ace, a player you’ve noticed makes a
habit of playing any hand with an ace (hands like A-4 off-suit). How does she play
them? She likes to bet strongly and isn’t afraid to call. Her pre-flop raise is an indi-
cation that she probably holds some type of ace. The flop comes A K 8.
You now have the top two pair and almost certainly the best hand, barring trips 
from your happy-footed opponent. In the brick-and-mortar world, your opponent
may call you on a bet equal to the big blind, and maybe double if you’re lucky. But
Nice has a tendency to show just a little too much pride in her aces. She may or
may not call an all-in bet; a better play may be to bet half your stack. She may get
greedy and raise you back all-in. If she merely calls, you can push her all-in on the
turn, regardless of the card that comes. We don’t know of a brick-and-mortar house
in the world where you see this kind of brash calling behavior, but such hubris is a
surprisingly common occurrence online, especially on the smaller buy-in no-limit
tables.
After your Hold ’Em experience, you decide to test your broadening skill in a pot-
limit Omaha tournament. Similar to the Hold ’Em tourney, most players are still evenly
chip-stacked. You’re dealt Ad Qh Qs 4d. All players at the table call the big-blind
pre-flop. The flop comes Qd 10d 3h. This flop is nearly perfect for your hand: You
now hold the top set of trips and the nut flush draw. Any board pair gives you the top
full house. The freak Qc hitting on the turn or river gives you quads. Your odds of
winning this hand, irrespective of the next cards hitting the board, are very high.
If you’re in an early position in a small buy-in pot-limit Omaha tourney, we can nearly
guarantee that if you make a pot-sized bet, someone at the table will call it. Another
player (especially someone with a lower flush draw) may think that you want to buy
the pot. A better play may be to check and then max raise any action that comes
behind you. If you do check and the betting round checks all the way through, you
should make a pot-sized bet on the turn card.
If you’re in late position, especially on the dealer marker, consider making a bet
equal to half the pot. To the other players, your bet is hard to interpret — are you bet-
ting a flush draw or just mildly betting your position, trying to force other players
out? You may even entice someone to raise, which means you can make a pot-sized
re-raise. If you do get a caller on a half-pot bet, make a maximum bet on the turn,
regardless of the card.

Taking down loose callers
The online all-in fad breeds an interesting side effect: Because play-
ers are so cavalier about pushing all-in, opponents in the online
world are also more likely to call. You can use this behavior to
your advantage. If you observe a loose-calling opponent, feel free
to up your normal brick-and-mortar bet in any situation by at least
20 percent in the online world. If you can get called for more
money (and assuming you want to be called), you should. If you
don’t mind taking occasional bad beats, go ahead and push all-in.
Larger bets reap bigger rewards in the online world than in the

An aggressive no-limit Hold ’Em primer
Most players today have their first experience with a no-limit Hold ’Em tournament
online for a low buy-in entry fee. The aggressive online style immediately becomes
the norm for these players. If you’ve played in tournaments in the brick-and-mortar
world, however, the far-more aggressive online style may catch you off guard.
During the first few orbits of the dealer marker, when the blinds are still low, you
need to brace yourself for a few all-in plays post-flop.
If you’re up against a player you have no previous experience with, and you face an
all-in (as a raise or as a bet in front of you), you have a couple of choices. If you’re
up against a player you know you can beat from your observations of his play to this
point, your best move may be fold and wait for more advantageous circumstances.
If, however, you’re feeling continually pushed around by the same player; you have
strong reason to believe he is bluffing; or you just want to take a step up to a world
with larger swings (where you can quickly double your stack or lose it all), here are
some possible ways to react:
Call the all-in bet if you have
 Any trips or two pair
 Top pair with the highest possible kicker (only)
 Queen high or better flush draw, along with any pair
 Top pair and an open-ended straight draw
 The best flush draw, but only if you face more than one caller on the hand (you
need good odds on your money)
 The best straight draw, but only if you face more than one caller and a flush
draw isn’t on the board
Fold all other hands. You can hold your ground by using this strategy in low buy-in
tournaments, but you should be prepared to occasionally call an opponent’s set of
trips. Your best strategy is to stay patient and play a solid game. Don’t get caught up
in the action or take another player’s looseness personally!

brick-and-mortar world, simply because more people are willing to
call large bets.
Although you may put yourself in a good position by taking down
crazy callers, you don’t want to fall in love with the action and
become a loose caller yourself. Stick to your game and make the
loose players pay. Don’t be too proud to muck cards if someone
comes at you hard and you don’t have it. Your cards will get better,
and other opportunities are just around the corner. And if your
opponents adjust to your tight, aggressive play and tighten up
themselves, you can loosen up and drive them nuts.
Going micro in no-limit/pot-limit ring games
Only fairly serious poker players have played no-limit ring games or
pot-limit Omaha outside of the Internet, because the lowest limit
you can find in the brick-and-mortar world is around $1/$2 Hold ’Em
with a $200 maximum buy-in. You can only play Omaha ring games
with pot-limits. On the Net, you can play both no-limit Hold ’Em and
pot-limit Omaha for around $0.01/$0.02 blinds and a $2 maximum
buy-in.
Your initial reaction may be that these games are a bargain. You
can buy-in for almost nothing and play to your heart’s content
without risking a fortune. Yep, you’re right: If you’re looking for 
no-limit ring games, the micro limits are the place to start.
Winning . . . and losing, too
The low-stakes form of no-limit ring games are also the toughest
games to beat in the micro-limit world. But they can also be some
of the most enjoyable, and you can win consistently if you stick to
a solid game plan.
The strategy and dynamic of no-limit ring games are strikingly 
different from no-limit tournaments. Think of micro no-limit ring
games only as a stepping stone to other no-limit ring games 
with higher table stakes, not as a stepping stone to no-limit 
tournaments. 
When you first sit down at a ring game table, especially as a begin-
ner, you should expect to lose your entire stack. And then expect
that to happen again. And again. Experienced players come to
these games to tap bankrolls. It doesn’t seem like you can make
much money at the micro-limits, but many players make more than
$10 per hour in games with a maximum buy-in of $2.
Play gets tougher as you move to the higher limits, so be sure to
play within your bankroll. (We cover bankrolls and philosophical
differences between ring games and tourney play in Chapter 8.)
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 79

Watching out for gorillas
No-limit ring games restrict you as to the amount of money you can
bring to the table. If you sit down and another player has consider-
ably more than the upper amount allowed (say, more than three
times), you may want to consider another table.

What about HAL?
In the world of software, robots are computerized programs that automatically per-
form tasks. In the case of poker, a robot is a software program that humans develop
to play Internet poker. Robots play with a certain pre-programmed amount of 
artificial intelligence (meaning strategy, in this case). If you come across a site 
that even mentions robots, you can be certain it has a flat out ban on them. The 
reasoning is robots could be an unfair advantage, and thanks in part to 2001: 
A Space Odyssey, they just kind of creep people out.
So do poker robots still exist on some sites? Almost certainly. Although we’ve never
actually seen any with a lot of strategic intelligence (sites use dumb ones for 
internal testing all the time to make sure their poker software is behaving properly),
we’ve heard plenty of talk about them around Silicon Valley. In the software 
world, any time you hear a lot of talk, you can be certain someone is working on it
somewhere.
The important question is: Are smart robots a threat to you? Poker is based on
incomplete data; you don’t know what your opponent holds, and you intentionally try
to disguise the true strength of your hand. Along with not having the intuition that
humans possess, having incomplete data creates some of the most difficult prob-
lems for computers to tackle.
Due to luck, robots certainly could beat anyone now (just like any player can beat
anyone else through luck). In the distant future, robots may be able to beat the best
human players consistently, out of sheer luck. But today the problem is too com-
plex, and humans don’t understand the computer models well enough to make a
program that can beat the best players consistently.
You could set up a robot that dependably makes money on something like a $0.50/$1
Omaha table, because of the general level of play you find there (the stakes are so
low that you mostly find beginners who may not be very good; you also find veter-
ans players trying to make easy money, but as we said, even a robot can get lucky
against these players despite their vulnerability). A program that applies a simple
formula, such as which hands to play in which positions (and then just calls any
bet), could be a moneymaker against a table full of low-limit players. But the pre-
dictability of robots, as they almost certainly stand today, makes them ultimately
vulnerable to a sharper player.
If you suspect a robot is playing against you, pay attention to the opponent’s play-
ing style. You’ll probably make the player out to be a human playing predictably. And
anything predictable is beatable, robot or human.

When you sit across from someone with a tremendous stack over
and above everyone else at the table, you see two things. A smart
gorilla with plenty of chips, and a bunch of bananas who aren’t
smart enough to leave the table yet. The gorilla, after he or she
becomes large enough, makes (or calls) bets of a crushing size at
any time; and the best players win the hands most of the time. How
do you think this player built such a stack in the first place?
However, if you observe a gorilla who you think plays poorly and
has enjoyed a ridiculous run of luck, you can take him down to
baboon status if you play well and become the alpha male.
Dodging (and Dealing with)
Online Pitfalls
Problems unique to the online poker world have nothing to do with
the game of poker itself and everything to do with the fact that you
play on a computer. Here are a few steps you can take to avoid
trouble, along with what to do when you find yourself stuck.
Staying sane in a world 
of distraction
In the brick-and-mortar world, your distractions consist of a few
nattering players, televisions silently glaring long-past sporting
events, and a cocktail waitress who’s always elsewhere no matter
how badly you need her.
Thanks to the wonders of modern computing, your online environ-
ment can be about 1,000 times worse. If you let your eyes and mind
wander, you may realize that you’re playing under an animated bill-
board with the computer stereo blasting and an Internet mailman
knocking on your door every 10 seconds with new e-mail. And that
only covers the happenings on your computer. (It gets more com-
plicated if you’ve got kids, pets, or angry spouses who think you
play too much Internet poker. We know, we know . . . too much?
Not possible.)
Tie your hands to your sides or wear blinkers like a racehorse if
you have to, but when you play, stay focused. Ask yourself the
same question you should ask when contemplating whether to
play multiple tables (as discussed in the following section): “If my
opponent doesn’t have the same distractions as me, does she have
an edge?”
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 81

Steering clear of multiple-table play
You can’t play multiple tables simultaneously in the brick-and-
mortar world, due to both physical and rule restrictions. (We find
it weird enough to play at a casino poker table with one of the
seated players also betting on the ponies. Can you imagine the
chaos of watching half the people on the floor running back and
forth between different poker tables?)
In the online world, however, you can play at multiple tables (play-
ing different game types and limits) simultaneously. Some sites
restrict the number of tables you can play; others make the sky the
limit.
When you first start playing online, especially on the Hold ’Em
tables, you may find the speed a little disconcerting. Just the
thought of playing two tables at once may seem a little overwhelm-
ing. It doesn’t take long, however, to get into the swing of the
action. After you play only one table for some time, you start to
picture yourself playing on another table simultaneously. In fact,
your inner action monkey may start to crave it.
Think of this situation exactly like you think of repeatedly hitting
your hand with a hammer: Just because you can do something
doesn’t mean you should.
The problem with playing more than one table at a time, as if we
even need to state it, is splitting your attention between multiple
games. You have more opponents to keep track of and more hand
and chip stack information to be aware of. You take on a lot of
responsibility, and it gives your opponents (who may not be play-
ing multiple tables; use the site’s player-finding feature to get a
report) an immediate advantage over you.
We absolutely don’t recommend playing multiple tables, but if
you’re enough of an action monkey to insist on doing so, you
should avoid one situation at all costs: Don’t begin play in two
tournaments of the same size and type at the same time. If you
manage to do well in both, you can ultimately find yourself playing
head’s-up simultaneously on two different tables — a challenge
that only Star Trek’s cyber-human Data could successfully conquer
(and even then, only with special effects).
Avoiding a wrong click
If you run multiple applications on your computer, you naturally
click on a window in the background to bring it forward. But if 
you click on an actionable area and make a betting decision, the
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
82

program passes, processes, and acts on the click in the application
window.
For example, you decide to work on a spreadsheet of your poker
history in the foreground and play at a table in the background.
You receive an alert from the game indicating your turn to act, and
you click on the poker window to bring it forward. If you happen to
accidentally click on the Raise button when you just want to bring
the table to the front of the screen, guess what? Yep, you raise the
hand accidentally.
To avoid mis-clicking, you should call the application forward by
clicking on the icon on your tool bar or grab the poker window by
the top of its windowpane. (If you accidentally click on the close
box of your poker table, don’t worry. All sites ask you if you’re sure
you want to leave the table.)
Be aware that some sites force your game table to the foreground
when your turn arrives. If you want to work on a spreadsheet
during your game (which you shouldn’t, because you should focus
on the game), you may easily make a click that gives you more
than you bargained for if the table pops to the forefront when
you’re not expecting it.
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 83
Two-fisted Karpov
Our friend Karpov is an avid online player who nearly always plays on two tables at
the same time. “After playing online for a while, I just found a single game to be a
little too slow,” he says.
Karpov’s particular flavor of insanity is to play single-table tournaments only — pot-
limit Hold ’Em with his left hand and pot-limit Omaha High/Low with his right. “I play
pot-limit Hold ’Em because I think the competition is a little easier than no-limit, and
you’re less likely to lose it all on one hand, especially when the blinds are low,” he
says. “I play Omaha High/Low for the variety.”
He always registers for both tournaments at the same time because he knows the
Omaha High/Low tourney takes longer to finish (opponents need more time to eval-
uate the hands, and the split pots slow the elimination of players), so he never ends
up playing head’s up on two tables simultaneously.
A fanatical record keeper (he can tell you the results of every online tournament
he’s ever played in — well over 800), Karpov knows he makes more money from the
Omaha side than the Hold ’Em side.
“I know I could do better if I only played at one table. I just prefer the action and
variety of playing two-fisted,” he says. All his opponents appreciate his attitude,
we’re sure.

Mis-clicking usually doesn’t cost you much money, but it does feel
like it trims years off the end of your life when it happens, and it
does put a ding in your lifetime winnings if it happens a lot.
Preventing machine crashes
You want the computer you play on to be as “clean” as possible.
Nothing spells more trouble for your online play than a crashing
machine. Can you imagine trying to play in a casino when the roof
keeps falling in? You essentially experience this when your com-
puter crashes. Here are a few tips to help you avoid online poker
catastrophe:
 Do some silicon stretching. Every time you prepare to start a
new poker session, do some minor Web surfing and check
your e-mail. Make sure you get the kind of connection you
expect. You want to see a nice steady flow of data. If your
system doesn’t seem quite right (and you have the ability, like
on a dial-up service for example), disconnect and reconnect
to see if you can make it better. If you can’t improve the situa-
tion, wait and play another day.
 Stay cyber slim. Keep the number of applications you have
running on your poker computer to a minimum, being espe-
cially mindful of any that have given you fits in the past.
 Get your digital flu shot. Reduce your chances of having
problems by regularly scrubbing for viruses (you can use
Trend Micro’s scan for free at www.antivirus.com).
 Take your online vitamins. Any time a poker site offers you a
software upgrade, even an optional one, you should take it.
Upgrades give you new features, important bug fixes, and in
some cases may increase the security of your data.
 Don’t do double time. You know we don’t like playing two
tables anyway. (If you don’t know this, read the section
“Steering clear of multiple-table play” earlier in this chapter.)
But playing two different sites at the same time is a really bad
idea. We’ve seen crashes in the past that were a direct result
of different poker applications not playing nicely in the same
digital sandbox.
Coping with disconnection
No matter how bulletproof your computer is or how reliable your
Internet Service Provider may be, sooner or later you find yourself
disconnected from an online poker game.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
84

In the good old days (two years ago), sites provided a service
called all-in protection. If you were suddenly disconnected, the site
treated you as though you were all-in and protected your hand to
the end. Unfortunately, too many people abused this service as a
strategic edge, and all-in protection went away. Today, on nearly all
sites, if you get disconnected, the site folds your hand. (Sites some-
times abbreviate their lack of all-in protection with the confusing
no all-in moniker.)
Getting disconnected is only a big deal during tournaments because
the site slowly but surely blinds your chips off. You have to get
back on if you want to save your stack. In a ring game, the site
simply changes your status to sitting out, and eventually you lose
your seat. The site re-credits the chips you had at the table to your
account.
Getting disconnected is a jarring experience, but after it happens,
you need to put it behind you. Focus harder than you normally
do on the game and calm down. You already had to deal with the
inconvenience the disconnection handed you — you don’t need
to make it worse by playing it over and over in your head.
Resuscitating your game 
(and computer)
The first hint you get that you’re disconnected is the normal flow
of the game suddenly stops. No bets. No cards being dealt. No chat
from players. Nothing.
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 85
Say goodbye to all-in protection
All poker sites used to have all-in protection, but abuse of this privilege caused it to
go away.
For example: If a player was in, say, a Hold ’Em tournament with Ah Ad, and the flop
came over 10s 9s 8s, her pocket rockets were now vulnerable to both a spade flush
and a straight.
If a player pushed all-in in front of her, all she had to do was disconnect from the
Internet. If the flush or the straight hit, she lost only her original pre-flop bet. But if
the flush or the straight missed and her aces held up, she still won the pre-flop bet.
Poker sites caught on to this kind of behavior, and for the most part, all-in protec-
tion has been eliminated from sites.

One of two things may be wrong: Your computer or the site
dropped its Internet connection.
To find out which is the case, quickly launch a new Web browser
window and do a search for something (anything) you’ve never
searched for before (just look across your room and type in the
name of the first object you see if you have trouble thinking of
something). If you can bring up information from your search, the
problem belongs with your poker site, in which case you should
just sit tight and wait. If the poker application quits while you wait
(sites often reset if they have a wide outage), re-launch it.
If your Web search doesn’t go through, the connectivity problem is
on your side. Perform the following tasks in order:

Server outage? We don’t need no stinking
server outage!
Our old sidebar friend two-fisted Karpov was battling it out in a single-table pot-limit
Hold ’Em tournament when the situation became dire. With three players left, he
had already placed in the tournament money, but he had a measly 520 in chips com-
pared to his gorilla opponents, each sporting more than 3,000 in chips.
Karpov posted the big blind at 400 and was dealt 2h 4d. The small blind raised to
800, and Karpov, figuring it was now or never, called with his last 120.
The site exposed each player’s cards, and Karpov’s opponent had Jc 10c.
Flop: Ah Ad Js
Turn: Qs
River: Qh
An extremely fortunate turn of events for Karpov, because each player had two pair,
aces and queens, with a jack kicker. Karpov split the pot and lived to play again.
But his situation was about to get even better.
The site didn’t reconcile the betting at the end of the hand, and everything froze.
Karpov checked his computer, discovering that the problem happened on the site’s
side. He waited and waited. The table closed and then disappeared from the site’s
listing.
Still in a daze, he received a mail from the site’s customer support:
“Due to server outages, we’ve decided to split the prize money evenly between all
competitors in your tournament. We apologize for any inconvenience this may
cause.”

1. Close out your poker application.
2. If you have a dial-up Internet connection (such as AOL),
close it out and restart.
3. After you re-connect, launch your poker application.
If you can’t, try to avoid chewing on your arm (which
doesn’t help you get your slowly-blinding chip stack back).
4. Log-in to your poker site.
5. Perform the find a player search on yourself and go to
your table if the site doesn’t immediately direct you
there.
Practicing Poker Patience Online
You need to be patient when playing online, just as patient as you
are when playing in a brick-and-mortar environment. Remember
you’re going to catch long streaks of dead cards. You take your
share of bad beats. Rough spots happen to every player, so the
better you can ride through them, the higher you can rise above
the other guy in the long run. Here are some things you can do to
remain calm and learn from each online experience.
Taking a break from play
Many players find it just a little too easy to play like a demon
online.
Win or lose a tournament? Doesn’t matter. Click, click, and you
enter into a new one. Just lost your 50th hand in a row? You can
shake it off. Keep playin’. Or don’t.
You (for your bank account’s sake) should take stock of what hap-
pens as you play. Are you winning or losing? Do certain opponents
always beat you? Can you find a consistency in the way you lose or
win? Are you beginning to show repeatable, predictable behavior?
We strongly suggest that if you experience some bad luck in play,
stop for a moment, take a deep breath, and answer the previous
questions. What you find may give you deeper insight into your
game.
Poker is like life: It goes a little better when you think before 
you act.
Chapter 5: Adapting to a New World: Internet Poker 87

Keeping a poker journal
An excellent way to stay on top of your game and analyze the hap-
penings in your poker world is to keep a poker journal. Obviously
you want to add information that makes the most sense to you, but
we suggest tracking the following:
 The number of players in your session
 Unusual plays you make that work and those that don’t
 Mistakes you make, and how you can try to avoid them in the
future
 The time of day you play
 The stakes and game you play
 Your wins and losses
You can set your journal up in any format you like. Microsoft Excel
is good for laying out spreadsheet information, of course. If you
want something more free-form that you can read from any com-
puter, you should consider setting up a journal on a site like www.
livejournal.com. Or you can do it the easy way by using www.
pokercharts.com or www.pokertracker.com.
The only bit of info we don’t suggest putting in your journal is com-
mentary on specific players. Reserve those details for the player
notes feature on the site, which we describe in Chapter 6.

T
he biggest difference between brick-and-mortar play and online
play, and certainly the aspect that immediately raises the 
eyebrow of an experienced casino player, is not having a warm-
blooded body across from you at a table, staring you down. Just
how in the heck are you supposed to read tells and recognize a
bluff if you can’t actually see the other players?
Picking up important information is harder, for sure, but the other
players do provide hints and clues (and you may too). Time to slip
on your trench coat, put on your sunglasses, and follow along as
we point out some tips, tricks, and gimmicks for figuring out your
opponents and masking your own intentions.
Evaluating Your Online Opponents
Your ability to evaluate your online opponents can be the differ-
ence between winning and losing. Do it well and you can rake in
the bucks and marvel at the greatness of your poker prowess. Do it
poorly and you augment the bank account of everyone else at your
table.

Although you don’t have the mug of your opponent to stare down
during a crucial all-in decision, you do have some tools at your dis-
posal. Take the basics, stir in a good dose of human psychology,
and you have a good start on your Poker Counter-Intelligence
Camp. (One of the interesting things online play teaches you is that
the physical tells of your opponents in the brick-and-mortar world
aren’t nearly as important as you thought they were.)
Taking notes — the online way
The raw number of opponents you play against online can be over-
whelming. A popular site may have more than 10,000 players at
any one time. With so many players, why even try to keep track?
And for that matter, how?
In the online world, you need every tiny hedge you can possibly
come up with against your opponents. You need to track their
actions to get into their mindsets, to understand how they tick,
and, ultimately, to use your knowledge against them.
One big advantage the cyber poker world has over brick-and-
mortar cardrooms is that sites give you the ability to take notes 
on your opponents. Note-taking is awesome (to use California
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level

Note-taking: Brick and mortar 
versus online
Successful brick-and-mortar players keep notes on their play and their opponents’,
but they encounter problems: Notebooks are bulky; you have another thing to keep
track of while you play; you have to update your records religiously to create value;
and referring to notes mid-hand is nearly impossible.
Oh yeah, and one other problem . . . 
Chris was playing fixed-limit Hold ’Em in a Las Vegas casino last year when he
noticed a player at his table sporting extensive notes. The guy wrote down every
hand he had, as well as the result (“4-7 off-suit, folded, no loss”). To stay on top of
things, and to ensure he didn’t miss a play, he wrote down his hand as soon as he
received cards.
Unfortunately, Mr. Stenographer was so engrossed in the game and his note-taking
that he didn’t bother to hide what he wrote. Whenever Mr. Steno stayed in a hand,
all Chris had to do was look down at the guy’s scribbles to figure out his hole cards.
(Not that Chris would do that . . . would he?)
You don’t encounter these problems in the online world, of course . . . unless you’re
really sloppy with copy and paste.

surfer-speak) because you can easily log information on every
online opponent you ever run across. By taking notes, you can
track an opponent’s play, and even if you don’t run up against him
for six months, the next time you do you can quickly call up
exactly what you said about him.
Your opponents don’t know you made notes about them, and you
can refer to your insights at any time during play without disrupt-
ing the game. Super-great, right?
Be careful: Your opponents can track information about you as
well. Always try to mix up your play and avoid creating patterns.
You normally get to the notes feature by right-clicking on an oppo-
nent and entering text. (If not, take some time to glean the site
while you play with free chips until you can find the note-taking
mechanism.) After you enter a note, most sites give some indica-
tion on the name placard, like a small I or N or something similar.
Notes persist from one session to the next, and over time your
notes accumulate.
Sites that allow you to see all the notes you take, in their entirety,
are extremely rare. Typically, to view the notes on any given player,
that person has to actually sit at your table.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 91
Ways you can lose your notes
Although you keep your notes from poker session to poker session, you may
encounter two situations on sub-par sites where you can lose the notes you so stu-
diously prepare:
 If your computer crashes, or your poker site freezes and forces you to restart
the application. When this happens, you lose all notes you have made for that
particular session, but the rest of the notes you’ve made in earlier sessions are
held intact. Losing your notes is especially irritating when you’ve been playing
in an extremely long tournament.
 If you have to re-install your poker software. Lame sites hold the notes you take
on your opponents local to your computer. That means if something happens to
the poker application on your machine (say it becomes corrupt) and you re-
install, you lose all your notes. Try to avoid latching on to this type of site at all
costs. Your player notes are valuable, and they take a fair amount of time and
work to establish and maintain. You don’t want to hand away all that hard work
to a sub-par site. (To check out a listing of popular sites, head to Chapter 2.)

Developing a shorthand notation
Due to Internet poker’s speedy nature, note-taking almost always
takes place under a fairly rigid time constraint. Sites quickly snap
your hands away from your view, and on some sites you can only
make a note on a player in a game — if he busts out and leaves the
table, your chance to comment on him disappears as well. For this
reason, you should develop your own shorthand notation — a few
quick letters you can jot down to note a situation (sb for small
blind, ai for all-in, and so on; see Chapter 3 for a table showing
common abbreviations). Whatever notation you pick, be consistent.
Keep a note attached to your computer (or in an open window you
can easily access) that holds a glossary of your note-taking abbrevi-
ations. This way you ensure consistency, and you don’t accidentally
mistake B for bluff when it actually means blind.
Scouring the details for great notes
As you take notes, you should be mindful of several specific details
in your records of other players. We approach this problem in dif-
ferent ways.
Red likes to keep track of details from individual hands he finds
interesting, such as the types of hands people play in certain posi-
tions and the types of hands his opponents tend to bet heavily.
As with everything in his life, Chris takes a slightly more analytical
approach. He almost never takes notes on a specific hand, because
it means having to go in and re-interpret individual hand actions.
He instead comes to general conclusions about a player. His con-
clusions often include advice: “Against this player call on the flop
and bet out if an ace hits the board,” or “This player only plays
three suited cards, three cards of a straight, or a pair as starting
cards in Seven-Card Stud.”
And don’t forget, if you make an unusual play or a mistake against
an opponent (a bluff that doesn’t work, for example), you should
make a note of that, too. Your short-term loss may turn into long-
term gain, because your opponent thinks your level or style of play
is different than it actually is and you can use that thought process
to your advantage.
By their very definition, notes are highly individual and tailored
specifically to your tastes. Have a look at the next section and start
thinking about the kinds of details you want to track.

Gathering info about your opponents
Although you don’t know several things about your online oppo-
nents, using the available information that you have can give you
an edge.
Where are they playing?
Know the location of the other players. You can usually discover
this information by hovering your cursor over their name placards.
Doing this lets you determine, amongst other things, their time
zones. Most likely you would rather face someone playing at
3:00 a.m. on a Thursday than someone playing at 4:00 on a Saturday
afternoon. The sleepy and inattentive are always easier to beat
than the sharp and focused.
What other games are they playing?
Many sites support a find a player feature from their home screen
menus. With this feature, you can discover if your opponent plays
multiple tables and use it to your advantage. If your opponent is
playing you and is also at the final table of a multi-hour tourna-
ment, you can bet he isn’t devoting his complete attention to your
game.
Pinpointing personality types
It may seem hard to believe, but online poker players are actually
just people, too. And, for the most part, non-elite players are crea-
tures of habit; they repeat the same kinds of actions in the same
positions. If you can figure out how people behave in any given 
situation, you can beat them. Consistently.
Check out the traits to keep track of:
 Noticeable changes in personality. If someone has been quiet
and then starts talking at the table, think about the potential
culprits. Is it because he’s winning or losing? Or does it have
something to do with the hand? If a player becomes a Chatty
Cathy every time he has a great hand, or whenever he bluffs
at a hand, you have your clue.
 Reactions to winning and losing. If losers go on-tilt and start
spewing money, you may be able to help ease their chip
burden. Likewise, if a winner gets tight-fisted and backs off on
his betting with anything but the best of hands, you can make
him drop a little of his spare change to your lesser-handed
bluffs.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 93

Whatever you do, after you figure out a player, don’t tell him what
you know. We’ve seen countless people say things like, “You know,
Timmy, you always raise pre-flop with nothing.” Or at least he did
until somebody said something.
Keeping track of poker styles
You don’t have to keep track of every single play at your table, so
don’t get carried away with your notes. You are, after all, a poker
player first and a private detective second, so you should focus the
vast majority of your efforts on playing the game. However, you do
want to get in the habit of keeping your unblinking surveillance eye
on unusual plays and unusual players.
Tracking playing and betting styles
As your tournament gets going or as you play a few orbits during a
ring game, you should watch for patterns your opponents start to
display. You can exploit patterns if you discover them. Here are a
few areas to keep an eye on:
 The tightness of their play. A tight player only plays the
absolute best cards in the absolute best positions. A loose
player plays anything anywhere. Knowing this characteristic
helps you plan your moves against opponents: Tight play
against the loose players helps you take their foolishly cast
bets; aggressive play against tight opponents can cause them
to drop winning hands.
 The aggressiveness of their betting. Some people come at
you with their chips like a rabid junkyard dog on nothing but
junky hands, and others hang back and merely call when they
hold the nuts. Aggression directed back at bold players often
demands respect, causing the aggressor to back down. And
knowing a passive player only stays in with the best of hands
can save you a few bets.
 The amount they bluff. Heavy bluffers need to be called (and
raised) more often. You should generally believe and carefully
watch players who haven’t been caught bluffing.
 Their betting position style. Some people always make an
opening bet of the pot size (especially on sites that have a
“bet the pot” button) in the first betting position. If you see
this happening repeatedly, make a note of it and assume that
the player’s opening bet is nothing more than random noise.
Obviously, you want to avoid folding good hands that have a
good chance of winning. (In fact, you may want to sporadi-
cally raise these aggressors back when they launch those big
first bets to see how they react. Make a note of their reaction.)
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
94

 Their sneaky tendencies. Players who get too caught up in
the notion of fooling their opponents can become predictable
by too frequently representing strong hands as weak and vice
versa. You should avoid betting your marginal hands into
someone slowplaying a great hand, and you can sometimes
call an apparently strong bet when you think you have a
sneaky player’s weak hand beat.
 Their reaction to raises. If a player drops anything but the
best hand every time he’s raised, use this to your advantage
by betting on weaker hands to take down a pot or by folding
hands he stays in on. Likewise, if a player in early position
bets, you raise, and then he does nothing more than check-
and-call from that point on, take your cue to bet if you have a
strong hand (to maximize your return), but check if you have
something lesser.
Observing pauses
You can’t catch the body language tells of your opponents over the
Net, but your opponents may interact with your site’s software in
telling ways.
As you read the following samples about pauses, think about the
underlying psychology of what they represent and start building a
list of things to watch for.
Make sure when you observe these behaviors that you judge them
against the player’s recent activity. If someone pauses before most
actions, he may be playing at multiple tables at the same time or
just doing something else on his computer while he gets his poker
fix. In fact, if a slow opponent starts acting quickly, it may be
because he has picked up a real hand and put aside the spread-
sheet for the moment. Dramatic changes in behavior make great
online clues.
Pausing post-flop
Whenever you play Hold ’Em or Omaha against someone who
always acts quickly (either checking or betting) in the first betting
position post-flop, be very careful if you see her pause, especially
if she pauses and then checks. When most players flop a big hand,
their natural tendency is to stop, read it over to make sure they see
it correctly (possibly with a little internal gloating as well), and
then act. The reason you see this happen more often in first position
is because you don’t have ample time to react in the first position.
In other spots people have time to evaluate or use advance action
buttons.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 95

Unless your nemesis has gone to get some ice cream out of the
freezer, an unusual pause is highly suspect.
Pausing on large calls
A large-call pauser is even scarier for you than an opponent who
pauses post-flop. If you have an opponent who pauses until his
action timer is almost out, and then he does it again in the same
hand, you can bet 99 times out of 100 that his hand can clobber
any callers. What he wants to do is make it look like he has to make
a difficult call, when, in fact, he has an extremely strong hand.
Players who pause and truly struggle with a betting decision nearly
always fold.
Watching hand and position types
Some players only play certain hands, and they play them a certain
way. Others develop positional patterns, only playing certain
hands from certain positions.
If you combine all the hands together and compile enough raw
data on your opponents, you can amass great power and wisdom,
rivaling the greatest of wizards. After you gather plenty of data,
you can (and should) draw conclusions about your opponents’
play and then create counter-strategies that beat these players at
their own game.
Watch for the following trends and watch your account balance
start to rise:
 The types of starting hands they play:
• In Hold ’Em, especially on the lower-limit tables, keep an
eye out for people who play any two suited cards and/or
any two connectors. These players tend to chase hands,
so you should heavily punish them for it in no-limit. You
also don’t want to fall victim to the chasers when their
three suited cards or straight-makers do hit the board.
• In Omaha, keep an eye on players who become overly
obsessed with starting pairs, being sure to note how
they bet if they hit trips. In High/Low, watch for players
who always raise holding A-2. Your notes may become
reliable enough that after time, these raisers may as well
show you their hands. And some people play, literally,
any starting hand in Omaha — what you have to watch
out with these action junkies is how they bet their cards
post-flop.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
96

• In Seven-Card Stud, you don’t get to see other players’
hands very often because of frequent folding, so keep a
close eye on what they consider to be good starting
hands and try to remember their betting patterns as
hands mature. (For more info on these particular games,
flip to Chapter 7.)
 The likelihood of a player calling relative to the number of
players in a pot (and regardless of the starting hand). If
someone always calls from last position, regardless of the
hand quality, you may want to drop your junky hand in the
next-to-last betting position, because you know you have a
player calling behind you. If a player only plays strong cards
from the last position and they call behind you, you know you
have something to watch out for.
 The types of hands people play relative to their betting posi-
tion. In general, you should only play better cards in earlier
betting positions and let your guard down with weaker hands
in later positions (because in earlier positions, you don’t
know how many callers you may have). If you see players
bucking this trend — especially if they play weaker cards in
earlier positions, note it and always consider raising behind
them before any more cards are exposed. Weak hands should
have to pay a premium to see cards.
If you play the same player, or players, for an extended period of
time, you should take a look at your hand histories (you can usu-
ally find this function on your site’s home screen). Hand histories
show everything an observer sitting at the table would see (bets,
chat, and cards shown), including the cards you had every hand.
Going over these histories can give you subtle hints about the way
your opponents play.
Keeping Your Opponents 
from Figuring You Out
As you try to figure out what your opponents have, how do you
hide what you have? Very few people lose money by assuming
their opponents are overly smart; that can’t be said for players
who think their enemies are remarkably dull. And even if you don’t
take every word in this chapter to heart, make sure that you still
mix up your style so others consider you un-trackable in the poker
jungle.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 97

When you start to think about how your actions create an image 
in your opponents’ minds, you can easily fall into the trap of
always acting the opposite way. You know that people tend to
pause before checking when the flop hits their hand, so you always
check quickly in those situations.
Don’t let yourself form habits. Your opponents can start identifying
your pattern before too long, and then you’re fixed to be cooked.
Smarter opponents can always figure out the predictable players at
a table, so stay with any one behavior only long enough for your
opponents to think they have you nailed and then move to another
behavior.
Disguising your online hands
The key to disguising your hand online is to remember what the
screen forces your opponents to watch. Because they can’t see
your face, other players focus almost exclusively on your bet sizes
and your timing delays in making those bets. So to disguise your
hand you have to not allow your bet sizes be indicative of the hand
you hold.
Keeping them guessing
If anything, you want to be wrongly predictable. You want oppo-
nents to think you have a strong hand when you’re weak and a
weak hand when you’re strong. You want your enemy to stay in
and play when you have him beaten and fold when he has you
beaten. The majority (but not all, for obvious bluffing reasons) of
your betting needs to indicate strength, and you need to be sincere
about it. If you show strength, it makes opponents take you more
seriously and drop hands more often.
If you can’t produce this scenario, you want the next best thing:
being unpredictable. Your want your opponent to mutter, “I have
no idea what that person has.”
As a general rule, if you have a good starting hand, you shouldn’t
let the blinds see cards for free. Make sure to get a raise on the
table as a “card tax.” If you hold A-A pre-flop and don’t raise, and
the guy holding 5-7 off-suit gets to see the flop come 4 6 8, you
can’t blame anyone but yourself.
Leveling out your raises
We should also point out another form of hand camouflage in no-
limit and pot-limit games: utilizing one raise-size amount (say four
times the big blind) — especially pre-flop. No matter what you
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
98

have, if you think you should raise, always raise the same amount.
By taking away variation in your raise sizes, you give your oppo-
nent one less criterion to judge your hand by. Your opponents
know your hand is good if you show them good hands a couple of
times, but they don’t know how good.
The alternative — randomly choosing how much to raise — 
creates too much possible variance in your chip stack. Crazy bet
sizes are okay when you win, but if you lose a couple of dispropor-
tionally large hands, you can’t play aggressively any more. Random
raises may sound good in theory, but the practice is potentially
damaging.
You may be tempted to conceal the strength of a hand in Omaha or
Hold ’Em by never raising pre-flop or in Stud by checking after
each card. On the surface, not raising seems like it may give you
the kind of cover you want. Unfortunately, it also lets opponents
(especially those in the blinds) play cards they should otherwise
fold. The lucky flops they catch slowly (or quickly, depending on
how ugly the hand becomes) can bake you to a delicate crunch.
Varying your speed of play
One way to throw your opponents off is to vary your speed of play.
Sometimes play fast. Sometimes play slow. Sometimes use advance
action buttons. Sometimes don’t. Changing up your speed works if

vary the pace of your play to disguise your hand strength and intentions, you can
base it on the cards you’re dealt. Consider wacky strategies along these lines:
 If the cards you’re dealt are red, play slow; if black, play fast.
 If your first card is 8 or higher, play slow; if lower, play fast.
 Play fast until you see the seven of hearts and then switch to playing slow until
you see it again.
You may want to bias toward faster play, because you face times when you want to
consider your play, and you automatically need to play a bit slower. Just don’t slow
down every time you need to make a big decision, or continue your slow play for a
while after you slow down once.
You get the idea. But don’t get so caught up in being Johnny Random that you forget
to keep track of the poker game.

you have opponents who try to track your style of play. Some play-
ers in the online world always use advance action buttons, unless
they have a difficult decision to make. Don’t be this type of player.
Acting quickly when you’re the best
When you think you have the nut hand (one that can’t be beat),
particularly if you’re playing at a table with aggressive players, try
checking nearly immediately (especially if you’re the first to act). 
A player’s natural tendency is to pause and then check on a strong
hand. If you can check quickly, you eliminate this clue. But, as
always, don’t make it a habit.
Using advance action buttons
If your poker goal is to be unpredictable, and it should be, you
need to use the advance action buttons — but not religiously. You
should use them regularly, however, because you don’t want to
look like a person who never uses advance action buttons (which
constitutes a trend). By using them in different situations and at
different times, you have yet another trick to keep your opponents
guessing.

The “pause fold”
An interesting device you can use to help mislead your opponents is pausing before
you fold. Consider two cases:
 A player makes a bet in front of you, and you know you want to fold.
 You make a bet as a bluff or semi-bluff (if you have a decent hand with a chance
to improve but not the nuts), and your opponent raises. You now want to fold.
In both scenarios, you may want to consider giving a long pause before you fold. In
the first case, pausing makes your opponent think that you may call, and if he’s bluff-
ing, your pause may make him think twice about doing so in the future (he thinks he
dodged a bullet the first time). In the second situation, pausing makes your hand look
much better than it is, and it makes your opponent wonder why you’re pausing.
Pausing before folding, surprisingly often, entices your opponent to show his cards
to you, a case of “See? I really did have a hand.” And his need to establish domi-
nance gives you another nugget of gold for your intelligence bank: specifically
knowing what your opponent played, in what specific game position, and how. The
next time a similar situation comes along, you have a history to look back on for
guidance.

Establishing a table image online
No matter how humble or cocky you think you are, you always
have a table image, whether you create one consciously or unin-
tentionally. And you build your image differently online than you
do offline. For one, your online table image is much harder to sepa-
rate from your actual betting actions, because very little else about
you comes across on your opponent’s computer screen. Second,
the sheer number and fluidity (how they come and go) of online
players (at least until you get to the higher stakes, where not as
many people play) means you have to reconstruct your table
image from scratch every single session.
Your opponents use your image to evaluate you, and because of
this, you should manipulate it on your behalf. The image you proj-
ect often works best as a tall tale — loosely based on what you are
as a player but somehow distorted to make it not so precisely (nor
correctly) discernable.
If you can project a table image that doesn’t reflect your style of
play, other players ultimately make wrong assumptions about you,
and you can capitalize on their errors.
Just like the guy who is seven feet tall but tries to act like he’s a
dwarf, you may have difficulty consistently acting the opposite of
your natural character. Eventually you bump your head. If you’re a
conservative, serious player, you may find it hard to maintain a
wild table image. If you’re an adventurous player, you may not be
able to represent a super-tight image for very long. You’re better
off choosing a table image that you can easily sustain.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 101
Using advance action buttons 
to project your image
If you fold a series of times by using the advance action buttons, players get used
to the timing of the fold as betting goes over your position at the table. For everyone
at the table, your contribution becomes rote: When your turn to act comes in the
rotation, the site gives the typical pause caused by the action button use, you fold,
and then the game moves along.
If, at some point, you pause and then raise, everyone at the table thinks twice before
calling you. The action is so different from what you’ve done in the previous sev-
eral hands that the other players immediately notice it both consciously and sub-
consciously. You’re likely to see many, if not most, opponents fold.

Micro-limit games (which we discuss in Chapter 5) are a good
place to “try on” different table images. They provide a cheap way
to explore a few different personas and parade them in front of a
test audience. Does a serious image fit your style of play best, or
are you more comfortable (and profitable) being the talkative
buddy? You can use micro-limit games as a forum to fine-tune your
image, even after (and maybe especially after) you move on to
higher stakes.
Creating a tight table image
We enjoy the most success by establishing a tight table image
(especially in tournaments, where you can’t wait forever for per-
fect cards; you need to be able to bluff), because it makes your
opponents more likely to fold when you bluff. And by tight, we
mean that you should want people to think you squeak when you
get up for a glass of water.
You can help foster this image in the online world with advance
action buttons.
Ultimately, you create a tight table image with actions that show
you to be a very conservative player, only willing to be aggressive
with strong hands and ready to fold quickly when the odds are not
in your favor. The more obvious the actions, the better. (Of course,
you’re just displaying your image; after you establish it, not all
your subsequent play should conform to this facade, or else you
become predictable.)

Hold on tight: Projecting a tight image
You’re playing fixed-limit Hold ’Em from the big blind. The other players allow you to
see the flop with no raise. Five of the ten players, including the small blind, are in the
hand. You have 2c 6d.
The flop comes over 10s Jh 5s.
The small blind checks, and you immediately fold. Yes, you can check for free here,
but the odds of you winning the hand are extremely low. You have to pair your hold
cards (and hope your opponents don’t hold a larger pair) or double-draw the
straight, which probably won’t happen.
Folding actually buys you much more in the eyes of your opponents, because the
sharp-eyed take notice and become much more aware the next time you check or
bet from the same position. By folding here now, you make other hands in this posi-
tion appear stronger in the future. And the next time you get a garbage hand and flop
in this position, you can bet or raise and possibly take the pot right there.

Playing with a loose image
If you’re a bit of a loose player, you can play and win at the loose
end of the spectrum, of course, by choosing to present an even
looser and wilder image to your tablemates. It doesn’t take too
many hands to convince people that you’re a maniac. After you do,
the nervous players tend to stay out of your way (even with signifi-
cant hands), and others tend to call you more often, frequently
with very weak hands. If you can create a loose image and then
shift gears to play more solidly than your image suggests, you can
get more money out of your good hands because people (incor-
rectly) assume you’re a lunatic.
How do you look like a maniac at the online poker table? It boils
down to betting and calling when you really shouldn’t and then let-
ting your opponents know about it, which usually means exposing
your cards. The best scenario is to make a bet with complete
garbage and then catch a miracle card to win the hand, but it also
works if you miss. When your opponents see your hand, they begin
to think you’re crazy (and may take one step closer to insanity
themselves).
One side effect of giving people a loose table image of yourself is
that you take bad beats more often (especially in a no-limit or pot-
limit tournament setting, because one hand can cost you all your
chips). The crazier opponents think you are, the more opponents
you have to deal with every hand you stay in.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 103
Duping opponents with loose play 
in Hold ’Em
You’re the small blind in a fixed-limit Hold ’Em game. You receive 5s 7h as your 
hole cards. Eight people stay in the hand, and you make the half-bet needed to call 
pre-flop.
The flop comes Kd 9s 8s. You have an inside straight draw and decide to check.
Everyone behind you checks as well.
The turn is the 4c. Everyone checks.
The river is the Ad. You check. A player makes a bet, and everyone folds to you.
Calling here is insanity. All the opponent needs is one card larger than an 8 or a
pocket pair of any size and you lose. However, for just one large bet, you can call
and then show your hand. You don’t make a play at the pot by raising or some other
strategic move the table could understand. After the others see your hand, they
automatically think “fool” (and maybe think it forever if they make a player note
about you). You can easily get that bet back many times over in the future. Your oppo-
nents continue saying something like, “Oh that idiot is in. No problem.”

Keep in mind that a loose table image encourages more volatility,
because people are more likely to bet heavily against you and call
more often. Expect wild swings if you portray a loose image. If you
can’t deal with that, you may want to portray a tighter, less call-
inducing image.
Even the loosest players tighten up as tournament limits increase.
Be careful not to categorize someone as a loose or bad player if he
continues to survive in the tourney, and especially if you see him
start to slow down his wackiness.
Showing your cards to establish an image
We show our cards much more on the Net than we do in a brick-
and-mortar establishment (which is to say a few times in one 
sitting as opposed to almost never in the physical world) — 
especially in tournaments — because it helps to cement a particu-
lar image we try to project at the table. Clicking over the cards is a
good way to use your opponents’ sensory depravation to your
advantage.
If you want to establish a tight image, you should show your cards
when you have a very strong hand, especially if you’ve only played
a hand or two. You let the other players know that, yes, you do
play hands of quality, and yes, you do bet them (or not).
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
104
Falling victim to your Omaha insanity
You’re in the middle of a pot-limit Omaha tourney, in later stages with the blinds fairly
high. You watch as the As Ac Jh 6h flash in front of you. Three opponents call 
your bet.
The flop comes Ad Kh 3c. Jackpot. You now have trip aces, and because you gave
people the impression that you’re crazy earlier in the game, you actually get a caller
when you bet the pot (which amounts to an all-in bet).
Sure enough, Debbie Doubt with 9d Qd 10s 9c thinks you’re bluffing and trying to
buy the pot. She calls you with her pair of nines and a straight draw and is now all-
in as well. Everyone else folded to watch the drama.
Debbie is kicking herself while you do a jig around your computer desk. The turn is
the 9h. Debbie now has three nines but still trails you. She lightens up, and you stop
to watch the screen.
The river is the Jc, and Debbie’s straight beats your trips. All because she believed
you had nothing before.

You can also show your cards after a bluff to promote a loose
image, of course. If people think you’re a loose player, they call 
you more often in the future, even if they don’t have great hands. 
If you do show a hand, you should expect to see more callers on
any pot that you’re part of in the future (especially if you lead the
betting) — not necessarily a bad thing, because if you tighten your
play after you show a bluff, you may notice the average pot size
start to increase when you’re in a pot, giving you all the more
money to win in the future.
After you show a very strong hand, don’t do it again. You want
people to keep a tiny bit of doubt over exactly what you’re playing.
Bolstering your image through chat
You shouldn’t ignore that little chat box on your screen. You can
use it to help your table image as well. Whatever you want to 
portray, a few lines of text can help drive home the point. The
laughing, joking guy, the disinterested sports watcher, the whiney
loser, the dumb student, or the lonely bachelorette. You can be
any of these characters. (Chapter 3 has the details on how to use
the chat feature.)
Strike up a conversation about any recent sporting event and make
a comment about a famous player if someone rises to the bait.
Even if you know nothing about the game or sport, you can always
do a Web search for “best catcher 2005” and make some bone-
headed comment, like “How about that Martinez?” It doesn’t
matter that you don’t know anything; in fact, it may be good to
blather on a bit about things you know nothing about. If the other
players think you’re an idiot, they may treat you that way and
ignore you as any danger on the card table.
Chapter 6: Figuring Out Your Opponents 105
Card-revealing strategies
You’re dealt A-A in the first betting position in a no-limit Hold ’Em tourney. You make
a raise of three times the big blind, and all players fold. You show your hand to indi-
cate you had the pocket rockets.
On the looser side of the coin, you can bet the same amount from the first position
with a hand such as 2-6 off-suit. After all players fold, flip over your garbage for the
whole table to smell. Now you can elect to play great hands while the rest of the
table still has your garbage hangover and take down pots of greater size (assum-
ing you avoid the bad beats).

You can also add a level of misdirection about your card play here.
If someone asks what you had in a hand, you can answer in any
way that seems fitting — truthful or otherwise. When you fold a
hand, you can tell people what you laid down (because you don’t
have a way to show a hand you fold online) — again, truthful or
otherwise.
Which way you go is entirely up to you, but keep in mind the table
image you want to project. Loose or tight. Liar or truth-telling
scout. Whatever you find fun and useful.
The one technique we don’t recommend is aggravating your oppo-
nents. Although you can undoubtedly set someone on fire if you
want to, it doesn’t serve you well in the long run. Imagine yourself
as a store clerk at a table where you’re the best player. The others
at the table are your customers. Only by treating them well will
they come back time and time again and bring you more money.
Besides, you don’t ever want to get in a position where you show
up on your site’s support staff as a troublemaker — if you manage
to get your chat privileges revoked, you have one less possible
weapon in your arsenal.

Misdirecting opinions with chat
You’re playing Seven-Card Stud, and your hole cards are the 5d and 5s with 5c 4c
6s 9h showing. You have two opponents left: one showing four clubs, and the other
showing two-pair.
Your river card is the disappointing Jh, and you fold.
One opponent asks what you have. You can say that you missed your straight draw.
The clubbed opponent likely has a flush already, which makes it look as though you
were drawing to a dead hand when in reality you were drawing for the full house.
This assertion may make your opponents think you’re on a draw again the next time
you hit a big hand.

Exploring Your Online 
Game Options
In This Chapter
 Coming and going with ring games
 Spicing up your gaming experience
 Checking into tournaments
T
he online poker world is a wild and wooly place. Large sites
can have more than 10,000 people playing at any one time.
(Can you imagine walking into a brick-and-mortar room of that
size? You could never find a cocktail waitress.) Because of the high-
traffic of online play, you can find almost any kind of game you
want at nearly any table or stake size: limit or no limit; Hold ’Em,
Omaha, or Seven-Card Stud; and tournaments or ring games. We
explore the staggering array of options in this chapter.
Regardless of your skill level and game of choice, the first time 
you play a new site (and especially the first time you play on the
Internet) you should play with free chips to get used to that site’s
interface nuances. (Check out Chapter 3 to become familiar with
general Internet nuances and Chapter 8 for tips on where you can
play to practice.) Graduate to playing at very low limits before you
move to playing higher limits. If you’re in for any nasty surprises,
you don’t want them arriving when the big money hits the virtual
table. The sidebar “Deciding what to play” later in this chapter
gives advice on how to move up in the limits you play.
Melding in Ring Games
Ring games (the fancy term for a poker game where you can buy in
and cash out as you please) are the most popular games on the
Internet. Betting typically comes in three forms: no-limit, where you
can bet any amount at any time; pot-limit, where you can bet any

amount up to the size of the current pot at any time; and fixed-limit
(sometimes referred to solely as limit), where you bet in specific,
pre-determined amounts.
With the no-limit and pot-limit games, if you’re unclear about the
buy-in and limits from looking at the home page, go to any table
and try to sit in an open seat — the site gives you very explicit
details of limits and buy-ins from the chip purchase dialog (and
you can always cancel if the requirements are too rich for your
blood).
If you frequent a particular site, regardless of the game you play,
keep an eye on any regular who always seems to win — especially
if she always wins and then leaves. What you’ve encountered here
is a certain sub-species of Internet poker shark who plays at limits
lower than her skill level dictates, merely to pad her account bal-
ance or to win the entry fee for higher-level games. You may feel a
temptation to stay in the game and swim with the shark, but in the
long run your bankroll is safer if you move to another table. (Flip
back to Chapter 6 to get a head start on reading your opponents.)
Hankering for Hold ’Em
Texas Hold ’Em overtook Five-Card Draw as the serious poker
player’s game of choice in the middle of the 20th century. The
takeover was so complete that the player who wins the $10,000
buy-in no-limit Hold ’Em event at the World Series of Poker in Las
Vegas automatically attains “World Poker Champion” status. No
questions asked.

An example Hold ’Em hand
You receive Ah 10h as your hole cards. The round of betting ensues.
The flop appears on the center of the table Ad 2d Jc. You go through the second
round of betting. (You have a pair of aces and bet on it.)
The turn is the Kd. You bet with your pair of aces and straight draw.
The river is the Qd. You decide to keep betting your hand.
The good news is that you have an A-10 straight (known in poker slang as
Broadway); the bad news is that any player still in who holds even one diamond
beats you with a flush.

Hold ’Em has such a stranglehold on the brick-and-mortar world,
you can barely tell other variations of poker even exist. And the
online world is no different. Hold ’Em easily outstrips all other
games that you can play online.
The game dynamic in any environment is simple. All players are
dealt two hole cards and take a round of betting. Three community
cards are dealt face up (the flop), followed by another round of bet-
ting. A fourth community card is dealt (the turn; more rarely called
fourth street), and the remaining players bet again. A final commu-
nity card is dealt (known as the river, fifth street, or when Lady Luck
flips you the bird, your favorite string of expletives), and the final
round of betting ensues. The player with the best five-card hand
takes the pot — you can use zero, one, or both of your hole cards
to make your hand.
Hold ’Em is extremely well suited for computer play, adding to its
popularity and domination of the Internet. Dealing happens auto-
matically with no delay for shuffling, and because your visual focus
falls almost exclusively on the community section at the center of
the table, even the little chicklet versions of the playing cards
aren’t too troubling.
In sheer number of players, Hold ’Em games outnumber all other
forms of Internet poker combined roughly 6 to 1. That doesn’t
mean you can’t play other games, but it does mean that you find
the most competition, the largest spread of limits, the widest tour-
nament variety, and the greatest selection in table size if you play
Hold ’Em.
Hold ’Em games also stage the most promotional events. The vast
majority of advertisements you see, ranging from “Win a seat in the
World Series!” to (we swear we’re not making this up) “Play poker
with supermodels,” involve Hold ’Em games. (For more on Internet
promotions, have a gander at Chapter 2.)
The overall skill level of an Internet Hold ’Em player is widely vari-
able, but roughly speaking the situation is exactly what you may
expect: The higher the table limit, the better the competition.
Most Hold ’Em tournaments (especially large multi-table tourneys)
are no-limit. Ring games tend to be roughly split between fixed-
limit and no-limit. The biggest moneyed ring games are usually
fixed-limit (say, $100/$200), although you can find a few monster
no-limit games out there ($25/$50, with some player’s stacks as big
as $50,000).
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 109

Sampling Omaha
The playing mechanics of Omaha are identical to those of Texas
Hold ’Em (see the previous section for Hold ’Em info), with two big
exceptions: You receive four hole cards rather than two, and when
determining your best five-card hand you must use exactly two of
your hole cards combined with exactly three of the five community
cards.
Until you warm up to this dynamic (especially if you’ve resided
under the polluting influence of Hold ’Em for years on end), playing
Omaha can be mind-bending. When you first start playing the game
(or if you’re tired), you can easily misread a hand. Some poker
sites have coaching text that tells you the best value your hand
can represent at any given moment (“You have two pair, aces and
eights,” for example). If you play on a site that evaluates your hand
on the fly, keep an eye on what the computer knows you have
versus what you think you have or have a chance of making.
Omaha just squeaks over Seven-Card Stud as being the second
most popular card game on the Net, but Hold ’Em is so overwhelm-
ing in popularity that many sites may have only a table or two
where you can play Omaha (especially in the wee hours of the
morning when the poker crowd thins out).
You can play Omaha in two versions: standard Omaha (sometimes
referred to as Omaha High) and Omaha High/Low, which is a split-
pot game where both the high and low hands reap equal shares of
the pot. You generally play Omaha, in all forms, with pot-limit or

What happened to no-limit Omaha?
Omaha is unusual in that the common “big betting” format is pot-limit rather than 
no-limit.
According to poker writer Bob Ciaffone, Omaha was introduced in Las Vegas as a
no-limit game in the early 1980s. But a problem quickly arose with this type of play.
During the course of a hand, anyone who hit the best hand (the nuts) automatically
pushed all-in, thereby shutting out any future betting (and the myriad of draws
Omaha lends itself to) from all but the truly crazed who didn’t mind risking all their
money on a draw. No-limit killed all the betting action — fast.
Partially at the behest of the players to help spice up the pots, casinos switched
Omaha to a pot-limit game (just days after its introduction). Sure enough, the table
action increased. Casinos, and now Web sites, have offered it as a pot-limit game
ever since.

fixed-limit betting. No-limit is an Omaha rarity. (Refer to the side-
bar in this section for related info.)
Omaha High
In the standard version of Omaha, the best (highest) hand takes
the entire pot. Sites offer Omaha almost exclusively as a pot-limit
game, and to us it seems to be the hardest game to beat on the
Internet.
As a gross generalization (but still an essentially true generaliza-
tion), Omaha players tend to be very skilled and very dedicated.
Compared to Hold ’Em, experts haven’t written nearly as much
about Omaha. As a result you tend to see more experienced play-
ers in the game, while the truly bad players stay away.
Pot-limit Omaha is the most popular game in Europe, and it also
enjoys extreme popularity in the southern United States. The pot-
limit version is a gambler’s game in a big way — you see a huge
variance in the hands compared to Hold ’Em, and it seems as
though pretty much any hand has a shot pre-flop. The skill in this
game, for sure, is knowing when to run away and knowing when to
stand and fire.
If you decide to start playing Omaha online and you haven’t played
it before, you need to read some of the rare theory books to have a
fighting chance. (As we discuss in Chapter 8, you can play for free,
but the crazy play that occurs when you play for free makes this a
bad way to learn.) Pick up Poker For Dummies (Wiley) and nail

Decision time: Omaha high
You receive Ah Kd 10s 10h as your hole cards. You bet during the first round.
The flop comes 7s 7c Jd. At this point you have two pair: sevens and tens, with a jack
kicker. (Remember, you must use exactly two of your hole cards.) You decide to
check and call a bet.
The turn is the Jh. You still have two pair: tens and jacks with a seven kicker. You’re
worried about another player having trips or a J-7 making a full house. You call a
moderate bet.
The river is the 10d. You now have a full house: tens full of jacks. Anyone who holds
J-7, J-10, 7-7, or J-J as hole cards beats you, but you have a pretty good hand.

down basic strategy there. After you get a feel for the game, start
on the lowest limit you can find. If you don’t, expect your learning
tuition to be pricey.
Omaha High/Low
Easy now Tex: You can’t automatically count on your three Cowboys
taking down this pot. In the High/Low version of Omaha, the high
hand splits the pot with the low hand if, and only if, the low hand
contains no pairs and no cards higher than an 8 (with aces count-
ing as 1). Straights and flushes don’t matter for the low hand. If 
no low hand is possible, the high hand scoops the entire pot. In
High/Low, you can use different cards for your high hand and for
your low hand. In both cases, you must use exactly two cards from
your hand and three cards from the board to determine your high
and low hands. You find roughly the same number of players in
both the pot-limit and fixed-limit forms of this game, based on
nothing more than personal preference.
Omaha High/Low, certainly at the low limits, is a great game to cut
your teeth on, especially if you need a break from Hold ’Em. The
split pots mean that you can enjoy the fun of seeing the site rake
chips to your side of the table about twice as often. (The increased
action can, however, be a little psychologically dangerous, because
you can get used to the new scooping rhythm of Omaha and end
up staying in too many pots when you go back to Hold ’Em.)
Pure Omaha players tend to look down their noses at High/Low
players, because they consider it a less skillful game. Don’t go

An Omaha High/Low winner — squared
You receive As 3c Js Jd for your hole cards, a good starting hand with both high
and low possibilities.
The flop comes over 4s 7d Jc. You now have three jacks for the best high hand cur-
rently possible. Your A-3 gives you a shot at the second lowest possible hand if
another card 8 or less that doesn’t pair the A, 3, 4, or 7 shows up on the board.
The turn is the 2s. You now have the lowest possible hand at the moment (A 2 3 4 7),
the highest possible hand, and a shot at the nut flush draw. Not a bad situation.
The river is the 3s. An odd draw. You no longer have the nut low hand (A-5 beats
you with a wheel, ace through five). You now have an Ace-high flush, and only some-
one holding the 5s 6s can beat you with a straight-flush. If no player has a wheel or
the straight-flush, you play your A-3 for your low hand and the A-J for the high hand,
taking the whole pot.

bragging about playing High/Low to any of your high-end, super
card-playing friends without expecting to get a little harassment.
If you see a game labeled solely as Omaha, always expect it to be
Omaha High. Make sure before you evaluate betting on a possible
low hand that you’re playing at a High/Low table. If you don’t and
you’re playing Omaha High, you end up betting on a losing hand.
Serving up Seven-Card Stud
Seven-Card Stud is probably the best-known poker game to people
who have wandered no farther than their kitchen table to play
cards. Every player is dealt two hole cards and an up card, which is
followed by a round of betting. The remaining players get another
up card (referred to as fourth street), followed by a round of bet-
ting. Another up card is dealt (fifth street), and everyone bets. Yet
another up card is dealt (sixth street), and everyone bets again.
Players who haven’t folded by this point receive a final card face
down (a third hole card — referred to as either seventh street or, as
with the last card in Hold ’Em, the river), and the final betting round
follows. To recap: All players still in on the river have three cards
down and four cards up. The best five-card hand takes the pot.
Like Omaha (see the previous section), you can play Seven-Card
Stud in two forms: standard and high/low. And, again as with
Omaha, you can expect to find significantly fewer active games to
join on the Internet compared to the number of Hold ’Em games
because it simply isn’t as popular with today’s poker generation.
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 113
Slow and steady Seven-Card Stud
In a brick-and-mortar environment, Seven-Card Stud is the slowest game in the
house; the physical mechanics of pushing a ton of cards around on the table and the
perpetual delay of slowpokes who wait to toss in their antes at the start of each
hand can slow play to a snail’s pace.
Online, however, the feeling is a bit more disconcerting and herky-jerky. With Stud,
some of the action comes faster (like the general dealing mechanics), but other
actions (like players evaluating their hands) are nearly the same. Because of this,
to us at least, Stud never feels quite right.
Obviously this is a matter of personal preference. If you’re a big fan of Stud in the
brick-and-mortar world, you should give it a whirl in cyberspace and see what you
think. People who play Stud exclusively in the brick-and-mortar world usually love
it online, but players who simply want to play a variety of games on their computer
may not be as thrilled.

Aesthetically, Stud often doesn’t translate as well to the computer
screen as Omaha and Hold ’Em do, primarily because you have to
look at many more cards spread around the screen instead of
seeing them grouped in one community playing area. Sites that use
smaller card images can really make you squint.
If you play online Stud, be sure to put your screen in a nice glare-
free spot — you don’t want to experience the aftertaste of not
seeing an opponent’s four aces showing because of a bad reflection.
You play online Stud almost exclusively with fixed-limit betting, in
both tournament and ring-game situations. To be honest, we aren’t
sure exactly why, but it may have something to do with the game’s
history. Stud is an older, slower game, played before the new fan-
gled “big betting” methods of pot-limit and no-limit.
Standard Seven-Card Stud
As with Omaha, if you ever see a listing that labels the game
“Seven-Card Stud,” the highest hand wins the entire pot.
In general, standard Stud games are very accessible, playable, and
winnable — especially at the lower limits. The general level of play
doesn’t seem as good as it does in Hold ’Em and Omaha, possibly
because not as many people play, or possibly because Stud schol-
ars haven’t written as much on the game, allowing for fewer Stud
scholars to develop. For information on general strategies for play-
ing this game, check out Poker For Dummies (Wiley).
As a general rule, if you can’t beat what you see face up from the
other players’ hands, get out while you can. If you can’t quickly
improve your medium pair, and an opponent has two queens show-
ing, you may be throwing money away trying to catch cards on a
dead hand.
Seven-Card Stud High/Low
As you may have gathered from the name, in High/Low the high
hand splits the pot with the low hand, if, and only if, the low hand
doesn’t include a card higher than an 8 (the qualifier). Straights
and flushes don’t count against the low. (You can have an ace
through five straight for the high and the low, however.)
Seven-Card Stud High/Low is beatable, but it takes more time to
master than its standard (high only) cousin. As with Omaha High,
this game tends to breed specialists, and you have very little writ-
ten theory at your disposal. You should play low limits until you
get comfortable with the different pacing and have a good feel for
the kind of behavior you see from better players.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
114

Be careful when you play High/Low, because it can drain your bank
account (especially if you’re new to it). Because you play High/Low
nearly always as a fixed-limit game, players with strong opening
hands (vying for high or low) tend to raise and re-raise in an effort
to get you to pay dearly for drawing cards. As a result, the betting
limits of the game can become doubled (due to many players rais-
ing the original limit).
Playing Crazy Pineapple, 
Five-Card Stud, and more
Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud are the staples of online
play. But other games come and go occasionally as sites experi-
ment with what customers want to play. Each of the following
games is, or has been, available online. Have a look on any given
poker site in the lobby under something akin to the “Other Games”
tab to find these little creatures.
You can’t really find much written theory on any of the following
games, but you always play them for low stakes, due to a general
lack of popularity. You also don’t swim into waters with many
sharks, which is a nice break from the normal Hold ’Em, Stud, and
Omaha minefield.
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 115
Straight from a Stud’s mouth
An example from a standard Seven-Card Stud game:
You receive 8h 8d as your hole cards and the 7s face up. (Online, your hole cards are
shifted down in the card line-up slightly.) You go through a round of betting with your
pair of eights.
Fourth street is the 6c. You bet.
Fifth street is the 10c. You bet. You still have a pair of eights with an inside straight
draw.
Sixth street, your last up card, is the Kd. Your hand hasn’t changed much with the
King.
Seventh street, your third hole card, is the 6h. You bet with your two pair, sixes and
eights.

Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple
Crazy Pineapple is a variant of Hold ’Em with one big exception:
You get three hole cards rather than the usual two. You bet and see
the three community cards, bet again, and then discard your least-
helpful hole card before you see the fourth community card. From
there, play continues like regular Hold ’Em. In the less-common
Pineapple, you receive three hole cards and discard one before the
flop.
Winning in both forms of Pineapple takes experience, because you
regularly face stronger hands compared to Hold ’Em. You may be
amazed at how often you find yourself holding the second-best
hand (the quickest way to go broke). The good news for a beginner,
however, is that you don’t come across many Pineapple players,
and because of that, all the games you find are low stakes and
fixed-limit ring play only.

Getting quartered
Imagine this situation: You’re playing a High/Low game with two other players, and
you’re dealt the best possible low hand, A 2 3 4 5 (the hand known as the wheel), so
you know you’re guaranteed at least half the pot. You should raise without abandon
at every possible opportunity here, right?
Not necessarily.
You encounter a problem if one of your opponents also has a wheel and a third
player has a better high hand than your five-high straight. Your opponent with the
high hand takes half the pot. You split the other half between you and the other
player holding a wheel. Although you contributed one third of the pot with your bets,
you only get one-quarter of the pot back when you tie for the low; therefore, you
lose the difference between the quarter of the pot you won and the third of the pot
you contributed (namely 1⁄12th of the total amount of the pot). Unfortunately, you’ve
been quartered. (Of course, this scenario is exacerbated if you have to split with
even more players.)
Getting quartered is rare in Stud High/Low, where everyone plays their own unique
hand, but the situation is surprisingly common in Omaha, where players share com-
munity cards.
If you suspect you may be in a situation where you’re donating money, even if you
have a wheel, you should merely call all bets. Don’t raise and don’t make the first
betting action (allowing for someone else to raise you). You may hear the expression
“Don’t raise a naked low” in Omaha High/Low, which is exactly the situation we’re
referring to: A case where you have a low hand that may be duplicated, giving you
no shot at winning the high hand.

Watch a bit of the action first instead of playing right away. And
after you get started, always keep an eye out for specialists who
lurk, waiting to pounce on your stack.
Five-Card Draw
Yep, we’re talking the Five-Card Draw of the Old West. All players
are dealt five cards and then bet. Players discard (you can throw
out none, some, or all your cards) and receive replacements from
the dealer, and then you make the final round of bets. Lay your
cards on the table and become the toast of the saloon (or the
target of a few 6-guns).
Five-Card Draw works surprisingly well online because you focus
only on your cards until the showdown, and all you have to do is
click on the cards you want to discard. The pacing online is near
perfect, very close to any home game. Even if you haven’t played
before, it takes only an hour or so to warm up to the betting and
game dynamics, as well as the caliber of hand you need to win any
given pot.
Unlike the rest of the online poker world, every Five-Card Draw
table we’ve played on has been congenial (if opponents chat
between play), and most games have been outright fun. As with
Pineapple, you can’t find much Five-Card Draw action, and you can
expect low fixed-limit ring games. Unless you get reckless, you
shouldn’t lose much money in a Five-Card game.
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 117
You Seven-Card Stud . . .
You receive Qh 2s as your hole cards and the 8s as your first up card. You go through
the betting round with your queen high and two cards toward a low hand.
Fourth street is the 3s. You have a three-card flush draw and three cards toward a
low hand.
Fifth street is the Qs, giving you a pair of queens with a flush draw for high hand and
three cards toward a low hand. You stay in through the betting round.
Sixth street brings the 4s. You now have a queen-high spade flush for your high
hand. You also have a pretty good low drawing hand — you need one more card
under an 8 that doesn’t pair up. You keep on through the betting round.
Your third hole card is the 5s. Your high hand is a Q 8 5 4 3 spade flush. You also qual-
ify for a low hand with 2 3 4 5 8 (remembering that the flush doesn’t matter). Unless
another player has a monster hand, you should rake in at least half the pot. Well
done!

If you need a break from the tedium of the larger Internet games,
the Western movie’s game of choice can be an excellent decision. 
If you want a poker game on the Internet that you can just dive
right into, Five-Card Draw is it (because of the low limits, congenial
atmosphere, and general pacing of the game).
Five-Card Stud
In Five-Card Stud, all players are dealt a hole card and an up card.
After a betting round, you receive three more up cards with betting
rounds following each. The remaining players have a total of five
cards. Best hand wins.
Five-Card Stud has the same game-dynamic problems as Seven-
Card Stud (see the “Serving up Seven-Card Stud” section earlier in
this chapter), although we like it even less. Having images of cards
(often small ones) spread about the screen just doesn’t feel right.
You can easily overlook someone else’s hand, especially if a lot of
players are in the pot. And overlooking another player’s hand can
be financially deadly.
In Five-Card Stud, you can’t expect a whole lot of mystery to come
with any hands, because 80 percent of what you have is face-up.
No mystery and no betting action lead to no thrill and no money.
We know there must be a reason why people want to play this
game; we just don’t know what it is.
Wild card games
You break out the kitchen table games, like Baseball, Follow the
Queen, and Spit in the Ocean, when you play with your poker bud-
dies. These games often require less skill and more luck, and
because anyone can get lucky, these games allow more people to
play more hands, and you tend to see more betting going on than
in the Stud games online. Sitting down at the kitchen table and
playing a game like Spit in the Ocean gives you a chance to have
more fun playing and spend less time thinking about strategy.
Brick-and-mortar cardrooms have never provided wild card games,
partially because players take too long evaluating the hands. You
also run into discrepancies in the ways different players interpret
the rules. You can, however, find online poker sites with these
games offered. Online sites spell out the rules precisely and never
mis-evaluate hands, making the Internet the best wild card game
destination outside of your kitchen.
Keep in mind that wild card games are still poker games, and if you
don’t pay attention, you will donate some of your net worth to
your opponents. Don’t get so caught up in the fun that you disen-
gage the strategic thinking portion of your brain completely.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
118

Have some fun by resurrecting a table of your old poker buddies to
play online wild card games. (Don’t forget to invite that one guy
from your old game who always lost.)
Player’s choice (mixed games)
If playing only one type of game puts you in a funk, or if you want
to get a feel for your overall poker prowess, player’s choice may be
for you. In this world the game changes, typically after every orbit
of the dealer marker (after the deal makes its way around the
table). You can play a round of Hold ’Em, followed by a round of
Seven-Card Stud, a round of Omaha, and so on.
You get variety without changing tables, and you get to exercise
different parts of your poker brain. And player’s choice isn’t some
online whim: You can play a mixed game at the World Series of
Poker. H.O.R.S.E., which stands for Hold ’Em, Omaha, Razz (Seven-
Card Stud, low hand wins), Seven-Card Stud, and Seven-Card Stud
High/Low (E for eight-or-better), combines all the major poker
games. Check out Poker For Dummies (Wiley) for more info on Razz
and other games.
The shift in rhythm can get to you, particularly if you’re tired, and
you always have to avoid misreading your Omaha hand after you
play rounds of Hold ’Em.
Taking On Tournaments
One way in which the online world truly trumps the brick-and-
mortar world is through tournaments. The concept of a poker 
tournament is very simple. Everyone buys in to the tournament for
a set amount and receives a fairly huge stack of chips ($5.50 can
get you 1,500 in chips). Play commences, with players busting out
one by one, until only the victor remains. A payout schedule deter-
mines who gets money, as well as how much, depending on where
a player finishes in the tournament.
Whatever interpersonal elements you lose by not having the other
players seated across from you like in a real-world tournament are
replaced with other perks in virtual-world tourneys. You don’t
have to deal with prolonged seating delays, poorly organized tour-
nament directors controlling the show, and the endless movement
involved in setting up and tearing down tables as a tournament
progresses.
Online tournaments give you a chance to play considerably more
hands than what you get in ring games for the same amount of
money, an opportunity to be king of the mountain, and quick-and
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 119

easy-chances to hone your tournament skills. When you play
online, you have the opportunity to play literally any time, in table
sizes as small as head’s up (against one other player) to huge
affairs with several thousand players.
One downside of tournaments in any environment is your money
tends to move more in blocks and chunks, because you’re either
winning a chunk of hard currency or you lose your whole buy-in.
For example, if you play in a $30 buy-in tournament, you may win
$150, $90, or $60 for a first, second, or third finish; but you lose all
30 bucks if you don’t finish in the money. A losing streak can be
fairly dear.
Tournaments are wide and varied. You can play for nothing and
win hard currency (in a tournament known as a free-roll), or you
can play in huge multi-player affairs where a relatively modest sum
gives you a shot at thousands of dollars. Depending on what you
play, you can win as little as $5 or score a fabulous all-expenses-paid
vacation to an exotic destination. For much more about tourna-
ments, have a peek at Chapter 10.
After you register for a tournament, you will play in it, unless you
hit the “un-register” button. After the tournament starts, you don’t
get a chance to un-register. If you’re unavailable to play, the site
automatically makes your blind bets and folds your hand in turn
(known as being blinded-off), and you eventually lose all your
chips. Most sites inform you of your tournament registration if you

Deciding what to play
Now that you have a feel for all the different online poker opportunities available to
you, the big question is: What do you want to play?
Your decision is obviously a matter of personal taste, but we recommend taking the
following approach:
 Play several hands with free chips to get comfortable with the user interface
of your poker site and the general playing dynamic.
 After you get a good feel for the game, switch over to hard currency in a low-
limit ring game. Play a bit. Win a bit.
 Move up in stakes in your ring game play until you reach about half the limit size
you want to eventually play.
 At this point you have a choice. You can continue to move up in your ring game
stakes, or you can play in (or move entirely over to) tournaments. Again, start at
a low entry fee tournament and work your way up.

try to log off, but if something forces you off a site (a computer
crash or a disconnect — see Chapter 5), you should always log
back on (even if you don’t plan on playing any more) to make sure
you didn’t forget a tournament entry.
Hold ’Em tournaments tend to be no-limit affairs (although you can
find fixed-limit games). Omaha tourneys, in all variations, use pot-
limit betting. And Seven-Card Stud tourneys are fixed-limit.
Sitting down for single-table 
tournaments
On-demand single-table tournaments run rampant in the online
world, and in the online world only. You register for the tourna-
ment and after enough people register based on the table format,
you play. On-demand, single-table tournaments are very common;
the players at your table make up the entirety of the tournament.
Full single-table tournaments
If you look at the numbers of people playing full single-table tour-
naments online on a daily basis, you see why full table is the most
popular form in the single-table tournament world. The tournament
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 121
Turbo tournaments: Playing 
at breakneck speed
At the request of players, some sites have sped up their game play by reducing the
amount of time it gives players to act (say, reducing your action time on any given
decision from 15 to 7 seconds) and by having the tournament blinds increase at a
faster rate. You see these tables or tournaments listed under headings such as
“Turbo.” 
Although you do see a few multi-table tournaments run in turbo format, the vast
majority are on-demand single tables.
The caliber of play is nearly identical to turbo’s slower siblings. We’ve never had
any problem playing at these tables, although some people may find the speed dif-
ference disconcerting. If you play turbos and you start wigging out, consider drop-
ping back down to regular speed play. The difference in speed isn’t worth the
difference in mindset.
Turbos are definitely not the place to start your online career, but you may want to
try them out after you broaden your online experience. We talk more about the con-
cept of speed in online poker in Chapters 3 and 5.

starts when your table seats fill up (with either 9 or 10 players,
depending on the site) and ends with only one player remaining.
Payout structures vary slightly, but typically first place gets 
50 percent of the prize pool, second gets 30 percent, and third 
gets 20 percent — you should check your site for the exact payout
schedule.
Single-table tournament experience proves valuable, even if your
interest lies in larger tournament types, because if your luck and
skill bring you to the end of a large tournament, you end up playing
a single-table tournament (known as the final table).
The recent huge successes of online poker players in the brick-
and-mortar tournament world (such as Chris Moneymaker winning
the main event at the World Series in 2003 and Greg Raymer in
2004) may be due to the online players’ single-table tournament
experience. Experience can be the best teacher, and before the
Internet, final-table experience was very difficult to obtain without
becoming a leather-bottomed casino regular.
If you have any interest in the tournament world, single-table
events are a good place to start. The tournaments are relatively
short (typically an hour if you make it to the very finish), and you
get plenty of poker practice for your buck. Chapters 12 and 13 are
dedicated to single-table tournament strategy.
Short-handed tournaments
Short-handed tournaments are a relatively new breed in the single-
table world. Here you play at a single table of five or six players
(depending on the site), with the top two players getting an
unevenly distributed amount of money (two-thirds to first place
and one-third to second).
Oddly, we find that these tournaments play radically different 
from the full-size single-table version. The players you oppose 
here tend to specialize in this form, making the games extremely
difficult to win.
You gain valuable experience by playing short handed at some
point in your online poker career, but you should think of short-
handed tourneys as one of the very last stones you turn over. Take
a look at Chapter 12 to learn more.
Head’s-up tournaments
Head’s-up tournaments are easily the most brutal and cutthroat
form of poker, which may be why you almost exclusively find them
in the online world. You find yourself versus just one other player,
and the winner takes all. Until you get used to playing head’s up,
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
122

the dynamic can be a little intimidating and disconcerting due to
the game speed and the fact that you put your entire focus on one
other person. Unless you have the skill to dominate brick-and-
mortar tournaments, gaining head’s-up experience means playing
online.
The advantage of these tournaments is their speed — you usually
finish in less than 30 minutes, and because you only face one other
player, your winning percentage is higher.
Head’s up is definitely worth trying, but not as your first online
tournament. But as you gain experience and skill and get serious
about online tournaments, you need to master head’s-up poker.
Good head’s-up play literally means the difference between finish-
ing first and finishing second in a tournament — often double the
difference in cash. See Chapter 12 for strategies on winning in the
head’s-up world.
Mixing in multi-table tournaments
Multi-table tournaments take any and all comers, literally attract-
ing thousands of players. Prize pools can grow gigantic, which
attracts even more players (which can be a mixed blessing — 
winning money is tough because you have so many people to
beat.) As people get knocked out one-by-one, the site continually
re-balances individual table populations to keep them full. For
example, say you’re playing in a tournament with 100 players. After
10 players bust out, the site chooses a table at random, breaks it up,
and sends each of its players to fill the empty seats at other tables.
Be sure you budget enough time to play. You can approximate by
checking out how long other tournaments have lasted; just look
through the lobby under the tournament tab for completed tourna-
ments of roughly the same size and compare the start time to the
end time. To win the tournament, or even to finish high enough to
get a taste of the prize money, you have to play until the end.
Multi-table tournaments usually have breaks — something like five
minutes of every hour. You stay in the game as long as you have
chips, so even if you get disconnected or miss a few hands to talk
to your mom on the phone, you still have your seat in the tourney.
The site blinds you off and folds your hands in turn until you come
back.
Unless you play in a tournament with no entry fee (a free-roll; see
Chapter 10), you’re probably better off playing in a few single-table
tournaments before you hook up with one of these multi-table
monsters.
Chapter 7: Exploring Your Online Game Options 123

Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
124
The table-balancing act of 
multi-table tourneys
Multi-table tournaments have an interesting dynamic in that, due to table balanc-
ing, you essentially play at a full table for several hands (sometimes hours) on end,
with at most one or two empty seats at any time. Toward the end of the tournament,
you start playing at tables with a few seats open; and then half the seats empty
(when barely two tables remain); and then a single full table that withers down to
the eventual winner. See Chapters 10 and 11 for more about mastering multi-table
tourneys.
At times it can feel extremely disconcerting to get moved to a new table due to table
balancing — roughly approximating what it feels like to travel by transporter beam.
After you land at your new table, make sure to take stock of the differences in chip
stacks to get a feel for who the strong and the vulnerable players are.

 Picking your limits
T
he stage is truly set when you pick a site, zero in on the sign-up
bonus you want, and transfer some of your hard-earned bucks
into the ether.
Now’s the time to get down to work. In this chapter, we talk about
the pros and cons of free chips and show you how to ease your toe
into the bigger pool of hard currency. Although you can get in over
your head, the water is only as deep as you make it. Stay shallow
before you dive into the deep end.
Playing for Free
Getting free chips from your site of choice is simple:
1. Launch your poker client and sign in with your User ID
and password. After you sign in, you go to your site’s
home page.
2. Pick the game you want to play (Hold ’Em, a variation of
Omaha, or a variation of Stud).
3. Look for games labeled free, fun, or some such title; you
can usually find them at the bottom of the list.
4. Sit down at any open seat.
You either start with the free chips provided by the site or
you get the chance to request the chips (request the max
amount — use all the free bullets you can).

With free chips, you can count on practicing, playing, and learning
without charge. You can squander thousands and never worry
about how to explain it to your spouse, and you don’t endanger
your kid’s college fund. But you can also develop bad habits, which
can be difficult (not to mention costly) to break when you move to
hard currency. You have to be careful; you don’t want to end up in
the ironic situation where playing with free chips now costs you
real money later on.
Reaping the benefits of free chips
Well, your chips are free, for starters, and you can’t beat that price.
Seriously, though, free chips have several positive aspects.
Adapting to a new site
Every time you try out a new site, you should play with free chips
first. No matter how many other sites you’ve played, and regard-
less of how high a roller you claim to be, you should play for free
to get a feel for the interface of your new home. Most poker sites
are different, and the differences show up in the user interaction,
speed of play, and general look. Play for free to get used to the new
dynamics.
When you practice for hard currency play, be certain to play hands
the same way you normally do at a money table (even if no one
else at the table acts that way). This way you can be sure to fully
exercise all the controls and have everything work the way you like
with no surprises.
Learning a new game
If you tire of playing Hold ’Em and want to embrace Omaha, free
chips are the perfect way to do it. You get the full game dynamic
and the full action with none of the fiscal penalty associated with
general game ignorance. We also find it easier to get advice and
tips from other players at a free chip table. (Go easy on how much
credit you give the advice, however; you may well get what you
pay for.)
Adjusting to computer speed
If you haven’t played online before, but you’re familiar with the
game you want to play, the biggest benefit of playing with free
chips is getting used to the speed of online play. You play hands
about twice as fast online as you do in the brick-and-mortar world,
and you definitely want to get used to that level of action before
you start playing with hard currency.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
126

Avoiding bad free-chip habits
Free chips share a similar problem with that beloved hall monitor
in your elementary school: They have no real authority, because
no one takes them seriously. To give you some idea, you should
expect a fixed-limit $5/10 hard currency Hold ’Em game to produce
an average pot size of about $100. In a free chip, fixed-limit $5/$10
game, the pot size often swells to $450. People stay in, raise, and
play more garbage hands. Hey, why not stay in until the river on
that inside straight draw against a few other players if it doesn’t
cost you any actual money?
That type of play sounds dopey, sure, but fake chips tempt you to
make those kinds of calls and worse. Just like too much candy
eventually rots your teeth, too much free chip play eventually
decays your playing skills. Your play gets loose, your judgment
gets buggy, and then you wonder why you can’t win when you
move over to hard currency.
Simply put, if your goal is to play for hard currency, you should 
use free chips only until you completely understand the game and
the site. After you nail down the dynamics, move to small-limit
(micro-limit — see the section “Playing low-stakes games” later in
this chapter) tables to play with hard currency. Moving up only
when you get comfortable with the game is absolutely one of the
best things you can do for your bank account, especially when you
first start out.
Deciding You’re Ready 
for the Real Deal
After you play with free chips on the site of your choice and you
feel comfortable with the way the site works, pull out your real
money and let it hit the virtual felt (and check out Chapter 4 to get
all the money basics).
Prepping for real play
Before you take the hard currency plunge, here are steps you can
take to ready yourself:
 Mentally prepare yourself to lose. Raw statistics assure you
that you’ll lose fairly regularly. If you play no-limit and you
lose an all-in bet to a weaker hand, you have to shrug it off.

Mathematically, you did the best you could do. (For an exam-
ple of this, see the sidebar “You’re going to lose a few” later in
this chapter.) In the long run, you win more than you lose by
making good, strong plays, and, when playing poker, you need
to focus on the long run.
 Bet in accordance to your bankroll. You need to have enough
money to withstand the swings of chance. You should start
with 300 big bets in limit play (if you want to play $1/$2, that
means $600), 10 full buy-ins in no-limit play ($50 if you plan to
play at a table that allows a $5 max buy-in), or 20 tournament
buy-ins in tourney play. Every time you lose one quarter of
your bankroll, back down to a lower limit. Continue doing so
until you start winning regularly.
 Get your poker journal in shape and ready to go. You can’t
really be aware of your wins and losses if you don’t have a
way to track them. See Chapter 5 for more on creating a 
journal.
 Make your poker nest cozy. You’re going to be spending
hours in front of your computer, so make it play-friendly and
comfortable. Chapter 2 has more on creating a good domain.
 In ring game play, keep in mind that you can always switch
tables. You have to realize you may not be the best player on
the Internet — and you may not even the best player at your
table. If the table you’re playing at seems too tough, make
player notes on the good players you observe (in case you
run across them in the future) and move along to an easier
game. (Chapter 6 has more note-taking info.)

You’re going to lose a few
Assume you’re playing pot-limit Omaha, and you hold Ad Qd Ks 10c as your hole
cards. The flop comes Kd 2d 9c, and the turn brings the 7d.
You hold the nut flush (you can’t be beat by another flush), and you correctly make
a pot-sized bet that pushes you all-in.
Although he doesn’t know it when he calls, your opponent, holding Kc Kh Jh 10d,
only has nine ways to win this hand (the three remaining deuces, the three remain-
ing nines, and the three remaining sevens to make a full house). If 40 cards are left
in the deck, he has a little less than a 1-in-4 chance of beating you.
The river is the 2s, so your opponent beats your flush with a full house, kings full of
deuces. Even though you took a bad beat here, you made the right play. Three out
of four times you win the hand. This just happened to be the other time.

Taking the game seriously
It may sound dumb, we know, but the most important thing about
playing for hard currency is to take the game seriously. We talk
about adjusting to online money in Chapter 5, but it bears repeat-
ing here: Because you only see it as pictures of chips on your com-
puter screen, your money may feel fake, but it doesn’t feel that way
if you lose it and check out your bank account balance the next
day. When you lose, you lose real money — money that you could
have put to any other use. If you ever find that you don’t care
about the outcome of a hand or game (or worse, you want to lose
just to clear an account you’ve set up with a site), stop playing and
come back later. Winning online is hard enough without adding a
financially apathetic demeanor to the mix.
Choosing where to start
Picking where you should start depends on your previous poker
experience and where you want to go in the future.
Starting out with Stud
If Seven-Card Stud sounds appealing, go to your site’s home screen
and find the lowest game it offers: $0.04/$0.08, for example. Start
there.
If you have an extensive amount of brick-and-mortar experience
and want to get started on the Net, play your first few hard cur-
rency games with one-quarter the limit you normally play.
Heading into Hold ’Em
If you normally play $3/$6 Hold ’Em in the brick-and-mortar world,
find yourself a seat at a $1/$2 table on the Net.
You want to become a no-limit Hold ’Em hotdog like the poker glit-
terati you see on television. Start with fixed-limit free chip play —
fixed-limit gives you a better feel for playable hands. Switch over to
a $0.02/$0.04 micro-limit game to get a good feel for pure game
technique. Watch a $20 buy-in single-table tourney. Find a no-limit
free-roll Hold ’Em tournament to play. Watch another $20 buy-in
single table. Read Chapters 12 and 13 about single-table tourneys,
and then you can sign up for a $5 single-table adventure. 
Trying out Omaha
You have always played $2/$4 Hold ’Em, but you want to try
Omaha. Have a seat at a $0.25/$0.50 Omaha hard-currency table.
Chapter 8: Building Your Online Poker Skills 129

If you have extensive experience playing ring games of a certain
form of poker, but you want to try out tournaments, play one free-
roll of that tourney variety to get used to the tournament dynamic
(see Chapter 10 for free-roll info). You can also watch two medium-
limit multi-player tourneys of that type (medium-level players are
experienced and provide better watching instruction than low-limit
players) before you play one at the lowest level.
Going for Omaha High/Low
You’ve always been an Omaha High/Low pot-limit player, but you
want to try an Omaha High/Low tournament. Play in one Omaha
High/Low free-roll (look for the listing on the tournament home
screen — your site should filter the listing and look at free-rolls
only); watch two $20 Omaha High/Low pot-limit tourneys; and 
then play in an Omaha High/Low tourney with a $1 to $10 buy-in
(depending on what your site offers). Watch for sloppy play at 
the $1 level; the low cost may make it too recreational to be
instructional.
If you don’t have much poker experience, but you want to start off
as a tournament player, you should start with free chips in ring
games of the poker variety you want to play. Switch over to micro-
limit tables of the game. Watch a medium buy-in, no-limit or pot-
limit tournament to get a feel for the level of play there. Participate
in one free-roll tournament. Watch another medium buy-in tourney
to see how much you’ve soaked in, and then get in there and play
the lowest level buy-in tourney yourself.
Playing low-stakes games
We know, we know . . . you’re good and ready to play with hard cur-
rency now. The time has come and the bell has tolled. Get your
cash ready; you’re about to break into low-stakes games.
In the brick-and-mortar world, low-limit typically means anything
under $6/$12. Sometimes you can find brick-and-mortar limits as
low as $2/$4 for Hold ’Em and Omaha and maybe a $1/$2 Stud
game. The Net offers a whole lower spectrum, sometimes starting
as low as $0.01/$0.02. (The site’s home screen always tells you the
available limits — just pick a game type and scroll to the bottom of
the list.) We refer to anything lower than $1/$2 as micro-limit; we
call everything from $1/$2 to $5/$10 low-limit.
Micro-limits
At the micro-limits, the level of play typically isn’t very high. These
games tend to be relatively easy to beat; a good ego boost for a
skilled player. Players at this level are considerably more congenial
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
130

than their bigger-monied brethren on the higher-limit tables,
because, after all, who gets that bent out of shape after losing a
dime?
Another good characteristic of micro-limit games is that the house
often doesn’t take a rake (meaning that the site doesn’t take a por-
tion of each pot). Many sites don’t take a rake until the pot reaches
$1, and if you play fixed-limit games with stakes of $0.02 and $0.04,
well, the pot just never gets that big. Rakes usually don’t amount to
much, but when you first begin and just get good enough to beat
your fellow humans, you’ll be glad you don’t have to out-pace the
rake, too. And if a few extra pennies in your online account add to
your happiness, how can that be a bad thing?
Don’t become blind to the difference between a $0.02/$0.04 game
and a $30/$60 game. Winning at the micros doesn’t mean you can
automatically go sit down with the heavy hitters. Micro-limit games
are played much more loosely than their upper-class cousins. The
caliber of play rises as you move up in limit on the tables.
Low-limits
If you’ve played low-limits in the brick-and-mortar environment,
the play on the Net should seem very similar to you. The biggest
difference is the caliber of player you face. In the brick-and-mortar
world, we have run across some very good players at the lowest
limits, people who study and practice the game and prey on the
ineptitude of other low-limit players.
You don’t find these veterans on the Net as much. The caliber of
play on low-limit online tables seems to be considerably lower. 
A fair percentage of these players may be people who want to see
action above the micro-limits but don’t have skills to match the
new limits.
Because of the average online play, low-limit online tables are prob-
ably the most lucrative place you can play when you consider the
amount of money you can make per hour relative to the limits.
Picking a low-limit game type
As you may expect from the world’s biggest poker rooms, you have
a broad array of betting formats at your disposal. If you find your-
self confused about any game type in the following list, flip back to
Chapter 7 for a more detailed explanation of the games.
Chapter 8: Building Your Online Poker Skills 131

Fixed-limit tables
In fixed-limit ring games, you can find Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-
Card Stud at limits as low as $0.02/$0.04. Hard-currency play is infi-
nitely more expensive than free, mathematically speaking (because
any number is infinitely bigger than zero if you multiply), but risk-
ing money is also infinitely more valuable to your playing expertise.
No-limit and pot-limit tables
You can find no-limit Hold ’Em ring games for as low as $0.01/$0.02
with a maximum buy-in of $2. You can check out pot-limit Omaha
for as little as $0.01/$0.02 with a maximum buy-in of $5. Some sites
describe no-limit ring games by the size of the blinds ($0.01/$0.02),
and others use the maximum amount they allow you to buy-in for
($2). With the no-limit and pot-limit games, if you’re unclear about
the buy-in and limits from looking at the home page, go to any
table and try to sit in an open seat — the site gives you very
explicit details of limits and buy-ins from the chip purchase dialog
(and you can always cancel if the requirements are too rich for
your blood).
Online no-limit and pot-limit ring games are a bad place to go if you
want to eventually play in no-limit and pot-limit tournaments. The
general play in these ring games is strikingly different from tourna-
ments, so practicing here can do more damage to your tournament
play than it does good. If you lust for no-limit and pot-limit tourna-
ments, go to the fixed-limit versions of your game first and then
switch over to the tourney of your choice after you get enough
practice and accumulate regular successes. (For more on the dif-
ferences between fixed-limit and no-limit, see Chapter 7.)
Small buy-in tournaments
The smallest tournament buy-in is a free-roll, where you pay no
entry fee but still have a chance to win real money. The good news
is that you can truly get something for nothing more than your
time, a little hard poker labor, and (undoubtedly) a smidgen of
luck. For more information on free-rolls, see Chapter 10.
One step up from free are the $1, $2, and $3 buy-in multi-table tour-
naments, available in Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Stud flavors. These
contests are as heavily populated as the free-rolls, but the level of
play is noticeably higher than in the free-rolls. You don’t see nearly
as many players staying in and trying to outdraw you with only
one out.
Small buy-in tournaments take hours to play, but unless they serve
as satellite qualifiers for larger tournaments (satellite tournaments
take the top finishers and place them into more lucrative, more
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
132

competitive tournaments), they always finish in one day. The low-
limit tournaments typically pay the top 10 percent of the tourna-
ment field. (You can find out more about multi-table tourneys in
Chapter 10.)
In the single-table tourney world, the cheapest tournaments you
can find are $5 entry fee on-demand contests in all limit forms of
Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. A little more expensive,
yes, but they go quickly, typically finishing in little over an hour,
and your odds of winning cash are much better because they typi-
cally pay the top three people at the table — a whopping 30 per-
cent of the field. (We have an extensive run-down on single-table
tournaments in lucky Chapters 12 and 13.)
Continuing to play, and play, and . . .
After you play a bit for money, keep right on going, with a couple of
caveats:
 Keep an eye on your bankroll. Any time you lose 25 percent of
your bankroll, you should back off one level of limits and keep
playing.
 Don’t automatically ramp up to the higher limits after you win
on the lower limits. You’re just as likely to have a string of bad
luck as you are to have a lucky streak. Slowly ramp up your
play if you start winning. Give yourself at least 30 solid hours
of play at any given limit before you advance to the next level
(and never skip a level). Yes, it means that you experience
plenty of lower-limit play, but you become very aware of
where your skill level lies.
 Keep a poker journal as we describe in Chapter 5. After you
log 30 hours of play at a certain limit, check your journal to
see if you’re winning. If you are, consider moving up a level
(don’t feel like you have to, however — because hey, you’re
winning). If you’ve been losing, back down one limit.
 If you continue playing at limits so low that it still feels like
you’re competing against cretins and coneheads after 10
hours of play, move up one level (but make sure you have the
bankroll to support it — see the section “Prepping for real
play” earlier in this chapter).
And always, always remember: If you’re losing, and you keep
losing, study along with backing off in the limits. Reading and
researching are the single best things you can do for your game.

Strategies for Short-Handed
Ring Games
In This Chapter
 Coming to grips with short-handed play
 Mastering head’s-up poker
 Preparing for tourneys through ring games
B
ecause online poker rooms can generate an infinite number
of poker tables, you have more table-size possibilities than in
the brick-and-mortar world. On the Net, you can find short-handed
tables, limited to just five or six players, or you can explore the
head’s-up format, where you alone battle a single faceless opponent.
Any table that isn’t a filled, normal table (9 or 10 players, depending
on the site), we call unusual-size (our term, not crazy poker slang).
Unusual-size games are fun for the amount of action if nothing else.
Because fewer players participate, you get to bet more often, fold
more often, and see more cards per hour; you just play more. Like
any other specific subset of Internet poker, unusual-size tables can
be very profitable if you decide to focus and specialize exclusively
in these games.
If you’re a regular full-table ring game player, you may want to play
some low-limit short-handed tables to get a feel for the poker action.
If you want to become a serious tournament player, short-handed
practice is required, because all tournaments ultimately end with
a dwindling final table (see Chapter 10 for more on tourneys).

Adapting to Short-Handed
Ring Games
Short-handed tables earn their designation in a few ways: The site
can automatically construct the table to accommodate only five or
six players (you can tell by the seating layout — the site’s home
screen labels these tables with terms like “5 max”); a larger table
may lose players faster than it gains them (referred to as breaking
down); or a new table may have just recently started up and is just
beginning to gain players.
If you come from a world of only full-table experience, short-handed
play can be a little intimidating and overwhelming at first. Hands
begin and end about 40 percent faster than full tables (because you
have 6 players rather than 10), and as a result, you see many more
hands per hour.
Also, because you face fewer players, the general quality of a win-
ning hand doesn’t need to be as high as on a full table, because
you have fewer players to beat.
Due to these characteristics, it shouldn’t surprise you that short-
handed play tends to draw in players hungry for action and speed
(along with the occasional lazy straggler who’s unwilling to get up
from a dwindling table).
Unless you have a fair amount of short-handed experience in the
real world, don’t start your online poker career here. If you want to
experiment with short-handed games, start with full tables first and
then work your way on down to the short-handed world. Playing
large tables gives you more time to absorb the rhythm, aesthetics,
and behavior of the online poker world.
Breaking into the short-handed
world
When you feel ready to break into a short-handed ring game,
decide first on the stakes you’re comfortable playing. Take the
limits you normally play in full-table games, pick out a table from
your site’s home screen that shows a short-handed amount of play-
ers on its number of players indicator, and make sure that table’s
limits are somewhere around one-quarter of your normal limit
comfort zone. You want to ease yourself into the game here and
not put too much money at stake too fast. If you often play $3/$6
Omaha on full tables, start at the $1/$2 short-handed tables. If you
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
136

lose as you gain short-handed knowledge at the low limits, you
don’t lose as much; but if you win, well, you still win.
Before you sit down to play at your table of choice, you should
watch the play at the table. Watch as much as you possibly can,
take a break, and then watch some more. The differences in play
compared to full tables are subtle, but you can definitely find them.
Pay special attention to the role of the lead bettors versus the
blinds to try to find clues as to why they took the lead.
Meeting short-handed experts
Like with all forms of poker on the Internet, some players special-
ize in short-handed games and play them exclusively, and some of
these specialists can be very good. If you’ve been playing on a full
table and it starts to break down, but none of the members have
changed (no expert has spotted the diminished size of your table
and has dropped in to play), you’re less likely to be playing against
a short-handed specialist than if you sit down at a table that the
site limits to short-handed play only and the experts are probably
lined up to play.
If you’re sitting at a short-handed table with a player who’s becom-
ing heavily stacked or playing exceptionally well, use your site’s
find a player mechanism (look in menus on the home screen) and
see if you can find that player on more than one table. If he is, and
the other tables he graces are also short-handed, you know you’ve
spotted a specialist.
As always, if you’re playing against someone you think may be
better than you, take it easy on your pocketbook and get up and
move to another table. But if you’re really interested in getting
better and learning on the job, you should consider your losses
to be tuition fees.
Molding your betting strategies
to short-handed play
As you observe and dip your feet into short-handed ring play, you
see that raising is much more common — especially on tables with
bigger stakes. In fixed-limit games, you commonly see two raises
before you see more cards after the flop. The reason for the aggres-
sion is that players want to establish who has a hand of strength;
essentially, you enact a version of playground boasting. One raise
says, “My hand is better.” The next one proclaims, “No, my hand is
better!”
Chapter 9: Strategies for Short-Handed Ring Games 137

This jostling for position comes in handy for the raising and 
re-raising players, both when they win (because the pots are
bigger) and when they bluff (because they acted as though they
had a big hand pre-flop and may be able to get players to drop
mediocre hands later on with continued betting action).
When you start to establish an image (find more in Chapter 6),
you’ll find it much easier to bully one or two other opponents on a
short-handed table than four on a full table. This zealous betting
action provides yet another reason you should start on tables with
slightly lower limits, because, ironically, the average amount of
money you end up putting into a pot tends to be higher on any
hand you play in short-handed games compared to full-table play.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
138
Channeling aggression 
on short-handed tables
To illustrate the aggressive betting that you see on short-handed tables, here’s a
hand from a $3/$6 fixed-limit Hold ’Em ring game we recently observed on a short-
handed table.
Six players are seated and playing (not players sitting out). Player 1 is in the small
blind and 2 in the big.
Player 3 raises pre-flop. Player 5 calls. Player 1 re-raises. Player 2 on the big blind
folds. Player 3 calls the re-raise, as does Player 5.
The flop comes 9s 10s Qd.
Player 1 bets $3. Player 3 raises to $6. Player 5 re-raises to $9. Player 1 folds, aban-
doning his original $3 bet. Player 3 calls the additional $3.
The turn is the 7h.
Player 3, keeping in mind the re-raise from the previous round, checks. Player 5 bets
$6. Player 3 calls.
The river is the 2c.
Player 3 checks. Player 5 bets $6. Player 3 calls. Player 5 shows As Qc for a flopped
pair of queens with the top kicker. The site folds Player 3’s cards because the
runner-up doesn’t show.
Our guess is Player 3 almost certainly had a pair of queens on the flop with a high
kicker due to his betting pattern throughout. Player 1 may have had A-K, or a large
pocket pair, but dropped the hand when the other players clearly showed the board
had been paired.
This aggressive betting pattern and style of play is very common on short-handed
tables. We only had to observe about four hands (the other three didn’t even make
it to a flop) before we saw this particular hand.

As a rule of thumb, especially in fixed-limit Hold ’Em and Omaha,
always raise pre-flop if you’re the first player to come in after the
blinds. During short-handed play, you don’t want to let anyone see
cards for free, which gives other players the chance to draw good
hands.
During a short-handed Seven-Card Stud game, you want to raise
any time you have a high pair (especially when compared to your
opponents’ up cards) or better.
Taking in short-handed 
play subtleties
Keeping track of a few short-handed nuances can make your new-
found short-handed aggression more effective and controlled.
Recognizing the importance of a single player
At a short-handed table, the style of one player can affect the
whole game. In ring games, where people are free to come and go,
you need to reassess how tight or loose the play becomes (and
therefore decide your response) each time a player joins or leaves.
The effect of dropping one player and adding another is much
larger during short-handed play than it is on a full table, solely
because that player represents more of the action (1/10th on a full
table compared to 1/6th on a short-handed table — almost twice
as much — for example).
Because you have fewer opponents to beat on a short-handed
table, you should play a higher percentage of starting hands than
on a full table (the quality of starting hands starts to drop as fewer
players are dealt in). But, as always, make sure to balance your
play against the general play of the table — play tighter against
loose players and more aggressive against tight players — to avoid
losing big hands to maniacs and to take pots from the timid.
Watching out for the calling stations
Keep an eye out for opponents who always call when their small
or big blinds are raised (which happens frequently on lower-limit
tables where players can’t lose as much money by playing loosely).
If this is the case, you should do one of two things:
 In no-limit, raise a little more than the last time you brought
in the first action. You may be able to find out where this per-
petual caller’s pain threshold lies — the point where he stops
calling you automatically.
Chapter 9: Strategies for Short-Handed Ring Games 139

 In fixed-limit, you can’t increase the size of your raise (because
you can only raise a specific amount), so you may not want to
raise pre-flop at all, merely to reduce the damage from bad-
beat cards. You don’t want to continually invest a large portion
of your stack against a player who stays on anything. Let the
calling station bust himself out (against others, if necessary).
Players who always call from the blinds affect your game more in
short-handed play (again, because they make up a larger total per-
centage of the table).
Considering lesser hands
In the short-handed world, you should play hands that, roughly
speaking, grade one step lower than what you normally play on a
full table. For example, if the widest gap you play from a middle
position on a full table in a Hold ’Em ring game is A-10, K-9 now
becomes a real possibility. If you limit your starting cards for Seven-
Card Stud to a pair, three to a straight, or three to a flush, consider
also going with three cards eight or greater. When the field drops to
three players or you start on a smaller table, give serious consider-
ation to playing yet another step down the quality ladder. With
fewer players at the table, you see fewer great hands — so marginal
hands begin to have more power. And for head’s-up advice, check
out the next section.
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
140
Making extra money short-handed
If you start to become a short-handed specialist and make good money at it, you
can make even more by finding large, dwindling tables and sitting down as they
begin to get short-handed. Players who refuse to leave dying tables are almost
always easier to beat than short-handed regulars for a couple of reasons.
For one, they’ve been playing at the table for some time (tables that break up are
often “older” tables — one player gets tired and leaves, a couple more follow), so
they often deal with fatigue.
And these poor souls are also typically less familiar with short-handed dynamics,
giving your experience an edge.
To find tables that may sport breaking possibilities, look on your site’s home screen
for full-sized tables with several empty seats — especially in the early morning
hours, when the number of players tends to drop off. Have a quick look at each
player’s locations (see Chapter 3 if you’re unsure how), and if many of the players
are up late for their time zones, you may have a winner.

Playing Mano-a-Mano in 
a Head’s-Up Ring Game
To find a head’s-up ring game, you look at the home screen of your
site under the particular game type you’re interested in (Hold ’Em,
Omaha, or Seven-Card Stud) and scan it for statements in the table
listings like “head’s-up,” “1-on-1,” or “2 max.” Any limits higher than
$1/$2 in head’s-up ring game play are unusual; micro-limits tend to
be the norm.
Surveying your head’s-up 
ring game options
Nearly everything in the head’s-up world, in all games types, is
fixed-limit. No-limit and pot-limit head’s-up ring games are much
more rare than their fixed-limit brethren. Although most head’s-up
ring game action you see is of the $0.02/$0.04 variety, you can find
$10/$20 fixed-limit Hold ’Em and Omaha and $8/$16 Stud head’s-up
play if you really search.
One reason sites don’t support many larger limits, nor no-limit ver-
sions, of head’s-up ring game play is that these games don’t get
much action; but more importantly, governments where the host
sites are based put a great deal of pressure on site owners to not
allow money laundering (the passing of funds from one player to
another — usually for illicit reasons), so they cap the bet sizes on
head’s-up ring games to keep big money from changing hands easily.
The big dollars in head’s-up action change hands during tourney
play, not ring-game play ($5,000 buy-in tournaments on demand are
possible). We’ve heard that people on the site staff watch big-dollar
head’s-up tourneys extremely closely for money laundering possi-
bilities. See Chapter 10 for more on head’s-up tourneys.
Bracing for head’s-up play
The first few times you play head’s up can be the most nerve-
wracking times of your poker career. If not for the low-limit nature
of most of the play, the tension would be completely unnerving.
Fortunately, having less at stake takes off some of the pressure.
Because you face just one other person, you may find it hard not to
take losing personally. But you shouldn’t. In fact, the first Zen-like
Chapter 9: Strategies for Short-Handed Ring Games 141

thing you need to grasp about head’s-up play is to not take it per-
sonally. View this attitude as just another aspect of your basic
poker skills.
Head’s up, in many ways, is the purest form of poker. Given enough
time, head’s-up play determines who has the better poker game.
It may be hard to swallow if you lose, and you may feel defeated.
Shake it off and dig just a tiny bit deeper in yourself and understand
that if one person beats you over a long session or beats you repeti-
tively over many sessions, you simply have a crack in your poker
game. Find out what that problem is by researching your play, going
over your notes, and practicing on the micro-limits. When you find
the crack, shore it up, even if you never play that particular person
again. Any crack that one player finds can be found by others.
Head’s-up ring game play typically falls into two categories: playing
for just a few hands before one player leaves (usually because he
gets bored, scared, or has other commitments) or battling back
and forth for a long time (say, 20 minutes or more — which in
head’s-up play can be over 60 hands). Not many sessions, from our
experience, last for a “medium” amount of time, like 10 minutes.
Comparing head’s-up fixed-limit
to no-limit
After you get your head’s-up feet wet, you notice a huge difference
between fixed-limit and no-limit play. Fixed-limit play is a long, slow
grind; hand after hand of churning cards and constant raises and
folds. Because the betting amount never increases or decreases
over the set amounts, assuming one player doesn’t get on a hot
streak, money changes hands very slowly over time.
No-limit, though it’s rare in ring games, is at its cruelest in head’s-up
play. If you like the sudden slashing nature of no-limit in full-table
play, you’ll love it head’s up. Long sessions often end with a good
hand getting beaten by a great hand. Because you see such an over-
whelming number of hands in head’s-up play (conceivably 200 or
more hands per hour versus 60 in an online full table), you see more
statistical flukes per hour. Oddities occur more often, like seeing
your flopped two pair dropping to a set of flopped trips or watching
in stunned silence as a flush bests your flopped straight on the turn.
For this reason, if you find yourself against the same no-limit ring
game opponent for an extended period of time with no noticeable
changes in stack sizes (an even stack size after a very long session
means that your skill level is about even with the other player’s),
Part II: Taking Your Poker to a New Level—The Cyber Level 
142

your best move may be to take a break or switch tables. The turn
of one bad card could cost you your entire stack, and when you
play someone with similar skills, you don’t want a long, hard match
falling to the whims of chance. Remember, you can always stand
up from any ring game table at any time. And, especially at the
lower limits ($1/$2 and less), you can always find easier opponents
than the one you’re playing right now.
Prepping for (and playing)
a head’s-up ring game
Playing head’s up is an art you perfect mostly through experience.
Although the basic approach is similar to playing short-handed
(meaning you play far more hands and bet more aggressively
when you do make a hand), you gain no real advantage by having
short-handed experience before you try out the game. Head’s up is
different enough from every other game form that it qualifies as its
own animal.
Watching head’s up in action
You do reap great benefits, however, from spending some time
watching the game before you play. Get a feel for the play and
style. Keep an eye on winning streaks. Take notice, as much as you
can, of the cards that the opponents play from starting positions
and the way they bet those hands (you don’t see very many of the
players’ cards because most hands end before the showdown).
Because only two people are in contention for every pot, you often
see strings of five wins or more.
You shouldn’t pay as much attention to idiosyncrasies in individual
players; what you want to pay attention to is the general tempo and
form of the game. Watch the speed of the game. Watch how the bet-
ting works, especially check-raising and re-raising when players
have a good hand. After you spend several minutes looking at one
table, move to another. Head’s-up style varies from player to player,
so watching several different tables before you dive in gives you
an idea of the different playing styles people use and the way they
coerce money out of various types of opponents. And although
styles may vary, pay attention to the basics: how many more hands
the players play and how aggressive the betting becomes.
Diving into play
After your observation, you should be ready to play. Don’t wig out,
because you can always leave the table at any time if it feels like
too much.
Chapter 9: Strategies for Short-Handed Ring Games 143

You may or may not pick the individual you play against; either
you join a player sitting alone at a table or you sit down at an
empty table and wait for an opponent to join you. It really doesn’t
matter what route you take.
As you start playing, see how quickly you understand how your
opponent plays. You may discover that your preferred style works
best against certain kinds of opponents and not so well versus
others. Because you have control over whom you play (because of
the ring-game format), stick with opponents who give you an advan-
tage and ditch people your style doesn’t fit with. How quickly you
can get a feel for your opponent varies (usually in 5 to 10 minutes),
but it should be a feeling that you know in your gut. If you feel com-
fortable and confident against your opponent, keep playing against
him. If you feel overwhelmed, consider going to another table.
Many players lose focus in head’s-up play by zeroing-in on which
player wins the most hands versus who wins the most money. As
you play, especially if sessions drag out, always keep an eye on
your chip count. If, after a long period of time, you fall behind, you
may not be able to blame it on a bad-luck streak; you may be facing
a stronger opponent. If so, don’t be afraid to leave the table and
cut your losses. Take a break. Cool down a bit. You can always
come back against somebody else.
You can’t enjoy mental breaks in head’s-up play. Every few seconds
you need to make a decision, which can be both stimulating and
tiring.
If you find yourself unable to give a head’s-up game your full atten-
tion, you should end your session or switch to a game with more
players where you’re not involved in every single hand.

When head’s-up chat turns ugly
For some reason (probably because only one other person sits at the table and you
have nothing else to focus on), we see much more player chat during head’s-up
play.
Simply judging by the conversations, you can expect to find the nicest and a few of
the rudest people in the entirety of the online poker world here. If someone gives you
a hard time, turn off the chat mechanism for your site or find another table. You
should report abusive players to the site’s support crew.

Translating Ring-Game Play
into Tournament Play
Playing unusual-size ring games can be very good tournament
practice. How much you should practice depends on the kind of
tournament you’re interested in.
Practicing for multi-table tourneys
All multi-table tourneys end with short-handed play. If you want to
be prepared for this, you need to first get some practice in short-
handed ring-game situations. Multi-table tournaments alone don’t
offer sufficient opportunities to practice short-handed, however,
because you spend the vast majority of the time at full tables.
After you finally make it all the way to the end, and table size starts
to shrink, your level of experience becomes critical. Finishing just
one position up in the standings can mean as much as double the
prize money.
For this reason, if nothing else, we suggest you get plenty of prac-
tice with short-handed and head’s-up play. When the stakes are
high, you become nervous enough without having to think, “Oh
great, now I’m head’s up. I have no idea what I should be playing,
and $5,000 is at stake.”
If you endure a long drought out of the prize money in multi-table
tourneys, you should consider occasionally refreshing your short-
handed experience through ring games (because the drought
means you haven’t seen a short-handed table in some time).
Gearing up for single-table tourneys
If you want to play single-table on-demand tournaments, you
should practice on unusual-size tables first, because these tour-
neys move from full table to short table quickly. If you play well
and have a little luck on your side, you can quickly go from a full
table to short-handed to head’s up, so you need to make sure
you’re ready to play at every level. (We walk through this whole
process of moving down in table size in Chapter 12.)
Chapter 9: Strategies for Short-Handed Ring Games 145

After you consistently enjoy success in single-table tourneys, you
don’t have to come back and keep playing the ring game versions.
But if you find yourself continually losing at a specific level in the
tournament, even if you’re in the prize money, you should sit down
in a ring game of the size you’re having trouble with and start prac-
ticing again. For example, if you’re always busting out of no-limit
tournaments in second place, play some head’s-up ring games.

T
he busiest online cardrooms have 15 times the number of play-
ers you can find in a brick-and-mortar establishment. Due to
the sheer volume of players, you can always find a thriving tourna-
ment scene, regardless of the time of day. Your choices range from
head’s-up tournaments, where you face down a single player (your
entry fee versus hers), all the way to huge multi-table tournaments
where you can win armored cars loaded to the gun holes with cash.
In this chapter we slice, dice, and julienne fry the options available
to you.
Examining Online 
Tournament Types
Technically you don’t see any tournament types online that you
can’t find in the brick-and-mortar world. However, the fact that
they exist in the online world does make them mutate slightly.
Tackling tourney basics
Any given poker site has tournaments on demand that range in
size from two-player head’s up to short-handed (five or six players,
depending on the site) to full single-table tourneys. You also see
scheduled tournaments that you can pre-register for and begin on

a certain day and time. Pre-registration tournaments are always
large multi-table affairs. To find any of these tournaments, just
click on the tournament tab of your site’s home screen.
In most cases, you buy-in (in free-rolls you register, but don’t pay
anything) for an entry fee, plus a small registration fee that goes 
to the house (say $20 + $2 registration fee). In exchange for this
money, the site hands you a pre-determined number of tournament
chips (something like 1,500) and a seat in the tourney.
Your tournament lobby (where you register for your tourney) has a
wealth of information, including
 When the tournament starts
 The amount of elapsed time (if the tourney has started or
already ended)
 The prize pool and its distribution to the various places
 The names of everyone playing in the tourney (and how many
players are participating)
 Your chip standing relative to other people in the tournament
 Rules on re-buys and add-ons
 The standings of players as they fall
Risking nothing in free-roll tourneys
Free-roll tournaments are the American Dream in the form of a
poker tournament. Here you can truly get something for nothing.
Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud are all offered. You don’t
have to pay to enter, and the winners receive cash prizes. What
could be sweeter than that?
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
150
Tourneys with antes
Some sites also have an unusual wrinkle in their Omaha and Hold ’Em tournaments:
After the blinds get large (say 250/500), they add an ante, which is typically 10 per-
cent of the small blind (25 percent in this case), that everyone contributes to the pot
on every hand. The ante increases as the blinds increase. Sites add the ante to
encourage betting action later in a tournament, partially by increasing the pre-flop
pot size and partially by putting extra pressure on the short stack.

Playing forever (and then some)
Although rare, free-roll tourneys do exist in the brick-and-mortar
world. Some are come-ons merely to get people to the poker rooms
early. In other tourneys, you qualify by playing a certain number of
hands or winning a set amount of other tournaments. One thing
you can say for free-rolls in the brick-and-mortar world is that, for
the most part, the play is sane and reasonable.
Because free-rolls on the Internet are open to all comers, they get
a ton of entrants. You always play them as multi-table affairs —
sometimes with a cap of the maximum number of players allowed
(like 1,000). Much to the chagrin of the online operators (who offer
these games as nothing more than a come-on to play the site), many
people only play in free-roll tourneys. The caliber of play you see
from your opponents can be so bizarre that you can probably best
qualify it as “random.”
Psychologists always have a hard time explaining why people
behave in a strange fashion (you know, like “Why does Harry walk
down the street with a waffle iron on his head?”), but in free-rolls,
the crazy behavior is probably some combination of the following:
 People not knowing how to play poker. The play is free, so
they figure they can do anything.
 People not caring what they play and just wanting to see how
outrageous they can get.
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 151
Only in free-roll tournaments
Here’s a hand we saw in a recent free-roll no-limit Hold ’Em tournament. The tour-
ney had just begun. With blinds at five and ten, the player in the first betting posi-
tion (under the gun) raised five times the bet. He got two callers.
The flop was Kh 8s 6c. The original bettor pushed all-in. Both people on the table
called. Now three people were all-in. The turn was the 2h, and the river was the 7s.
When cards were exposed, the original bettor had As Ac. The first caller had 5s 9d.
That’s right — he called a five times pre-flop bet with 5-9 and then an all-in on a gut-
shot straight draw and hit it. The third player had 3c 3d, so she called an all-in bet
with pocket 3s.
Only in free-roll tournaments (and possibly comedy shows) do you see this kind of
play.

 A few people wanting to get big stacks very quickly so they
have a real shot at making money; or people just busting
out at the very start because they simply don’t want to
waste time.
And when you do win, you haven’t necessarily won because you
often only get a seat in a larger free-roll tournament later. In order
to get a seat in that tourney, you must win an earlier free-roll. By
winning the first tourney, you win nothing more than the right to
play again.

152
A free-roll no-limit Hold ’Em tournament
strategy
In his book, Tournament Poker for Advanced Players, poker strategy demi-god David
Sklansky puts forward a no-limit tournament strategy that he calls The System.
Widely debated in Internet poker circles for questions about its general tournament
effectiveness, he originally designed it as a technique for uneducated poker play-
ers to compete in professional tournaments against poker professionals — but hey,
why not apply it to free-rolls too? After all, it costs nothing to try.
The essence is this:
 If you face no raise in front of you, push all-in with any pair, any suited ace, any
A-K, and any suited connector higher than 3-4.
 If you face a raise in front of you, push all-in with A-A, K-K, or suited A-K.
 Fold all other hands.
Technically, according to The System, you’re supposed to only play A-A in the first
four rounds and always push all-in with it, but that’s assuming you start with a gigan-
tic chip stack (say, 10,000 tourney chips with the blinds starting at 5 and 10). You
don’t have that luxury in free-rolls. Depending on the size of the blinds and your ini-
tial betting stack, you may or may not want to consider waiting. If your stack is less
than 10 times the big blind amount, you definitely don’t want to wait for A-A. Because
you get pocket aces so rarely, your chip stack starts to dwindle to nothing (due to
being lapped repeatedly by the blinds) before you have a chance to play. If The
System intrigues you, you should poke around on the Net for it. You can find
advanced versions of this strategy, but you quickly get to a point where you’re in
complex poker theory and no longer playing a straightforward, simple strategy.
Remember, in a free-roll, the number of people who call that would/should otherwise
fold is substantially higher than normal because they, literally, have nothing to lose.
Calling stations may nullify some of the built-in effectiveness. Still, you may want to
try it just for fun. (And if you don’t want to test it out in a free-roll tournament right
away, you can always head to a money session.)

To give you some idea of how carried away free-rolls can get:
One popular site recently had a free-roll qualifying event with
8,100 entrants. The top nine finishers landed in a second tourna-
ment with 500 others players (who also had finished in the top
nine of other multi-thousand player qualifiers) a few days later.
The first tournament took six hours to complete, and the second
tournament took four and a half hours. After a player managed to
fight, laugh, cry, bully, pray, and weep his way through ten and a
half hours of play, somehow weaseling past all the other competi-
tors, he received the very top prize: a princely sum of $100. Eighth
place got $10 — almost, but not quite, reaping a stunning $1 per
hour. Ninth place got a breath of fresh air.
You put forth a big time commitment for a whole lotta play that
rewards little cash. But hey, the person who won the example 
tourney didn’t have to lay down a nickel, and he gets bragging
rights for life. (Nor was it any burden to the guy who pushed all-in
with 7-2 offsuit and was eliminated in the first five seconds of the
tourney.)
You should note that not all free-rolls are as bad as the example.
The less populated sites don’t have these swarms but still have
free-rolls — essentially giving you much better odds. You can look
at www.pokerpulse.com and scroll to the bottom of the list to see
which free-roll sites are out there.
Judging the worth of free-rolls
In the pure mathematical sense, free-rolls are the best tournaments
going. You can make money without risking so much as a cent.
From a mathematical purist’s perspective, free-rolls are great.
Many poker purists hate free-rolls, however. The long-playing 
sessions get very tedious, and the grinding psychology of it all is
exacerbated by how little you win. Topping that, the play you run
up against is so loose that the game more closely resembles the
lottery than it does poker. Playing free-rolls, unless you repeatedly
make it far into the tourneys, doesn’t improve your general poker-
playing prowess and could ultimately be detrimental to your hard
currency play. If you only ever play against sloppy and lackluster
opponents, and you never risk any of your own money, you don’t
get the experience necessary to improve your overall play.
The worth of playing free-rolls depends on you. We view playing in
free-rolls kind of like watching Jerry Springer: Everyone should defi-
nitely do it once, for the experience if nothing else. But continuing
to do it? Hmm. It does seem a little odd.
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 153

Getting one chance with a 
single-entry tourney
Single-entry tournaments are the most common form of tourney on
the Net. You pay a set amount (the entry fee), plus a small amount
given to the site (a registration fee — typically 10 percent of the
entry fee), and you play until you either have all the chips or you
lose them all. You can find single-entry tournaments in two flavors.
Tournaments on demand are offered continuously and start as soon
as a tournament’s worth of people sign up (2 for a head’s-up tour-
ney, 10 for a full single table). They usually consist of one table 
(or sometimes two on sites with more flexibility). Scheduled tourna-
ments provide a specific start time and a longer period during
which you can sign up. You should expect scheduled tourneys to
be larger multi-table affairs. We cover the nuances of these in the
following sections in this chapter.
Single-entry tournaments (both scheduled and on demand) come
in the following variations:
 Hold ’Em: Fixed-limit and no-limit. Every now and then you
can find pot-limit.
 Omaha: Fixed-limit and pot-limit in both Omaha High and
Omaha High/Low.
 Seven-Card Stud: Fixed-limit in both Seven-Card Stud High
and Seven-Card Stud High/Low.
After you start paying for tournaments, the skill level immediately
gets markedly better when compared to the free-rolls. As you should
expect, the higher the buy-in, the better the play.
Any tournament theory you know from the brick-and-mortar world
applies here, although you need to be aware that players are more
likely to bet boldly in no-limit and pot-limit online than they are in
person (as we discuss in Chapter 5). We go into extended detail of
single-table tournaments on demand in Chapter 12.
Living nine lives with the 
re-buy tourney
In many tournaments, and in all tournaments on demand, after you
lose all your chips, you’re truly done. The site assigns your finish-
ing position at the very moment you bust out. So if you’re playing
in a 100-player tournament and 20 people go down in front of you
before you bust out, you finish 80th.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
154

But not all tourneys are this way. Take the particular critter known
as the re-buy tournament, for instance, where for a limited period 
of time (typically the first hour of the tournament), you have a
chance to re-buy into the tournament if you go below your initial
buy-in stack size — all the way down to, and including, bust-out
status. For more on what we think of re-buying chips (and its possi-
ble evil side effects), head to Chapter 11.
To re-buy, you click on the cashier button for your site. If your site
doesn’t have a cashier button, click on the chip rack on your table.
When you re-buy, you typically don’t have to pay another registra-
tion fee. After the re-buy time limit expires, you can longer re-buy,
and busting out of a tournament eliminates you permanently. The
sidebar “Step right up and re-buy” in this chapter illustrates the
mechanics.
Tournaments with re-buys are always specially marked on your
site’s home screen, either with phrasing like “$22 + Re-buys” or
“$20 R.” The tournament lobby always has all the details on the 
re-buy rules and stipulations.
Re-buy tourneys are most common in “large betting” games (no-
limit and pot-limit) and are very rare in fixed-limit — primarily
because one or two cataclysmic hands in a large betting game can
wipe you out. The betting ramps so gradually in fixed-limit that you
lose your chips far more slowly, and as a result, you don’t often see
re-buys and add-ons offered.
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 155
Step right up and re-buy
You buy in to a $20 pot-limit Omaha tournament. To play, you pay the $20 entry fee
and a $2 registration fee. The site automatically assigns you to a seat with 1,500 in
tournament chips. You lose your very first hand and drop to 1,450 in tourney chips.
At this point, you could click on the chip rack of your poker site, and for another $20
(no registration fee this time), you get 1,500 more in chips for a total of 2,950. (You
can’t re-buy until your stack gets below 1,500 again.)
Ten unlucky hands later, you’re busted to zero. The site automatically prompts you:
“Would you like to re-buy 1,500 chips for another $20?” If you answer yes, the site
deducts $20 from your balance (again, no extra registration fee) and hands you a
stack of 1,500. If you say no (or say nothing and get timed out), the site automati-
cally boots you from your seat and doesn’t allow you to return to the tourney. In this
particular tourney, the site gives you the option of re-buying only during the first
hour.

Adding-on at bargain prices
Re-buy tourneys often give you the choice of an add-on — another
way to buy more chips no matter how many you have. The add-on
typically comes at a mild bargain rate compared to the initial buy-
in and is almost always offered at the first break (typically one
hour into the tournament).
As an example, in the $22 pot-limit tournament we discuss in the
“Step right up and re-buy” sidebar earlier in this chapter, a pal of
yours makes it all the way to the first break. By clicking on the
chip rack, he receives an offer from the site for a chance, during
the break only, to buy an additional 2,000 chips for $20 (his first
1,500 chips were $20, plus a $2 registration fee).
Typically you only find re-buys as a feature of large, scheduled
tournaments. Add-ons are only offered in tourneys that have re-
buys, but not all re-buy tournaments have them.
You should definitely find out whether a tournament allows re-
buys and add-ons before you sign up (by looking in the tournament
lobby where you register), because the difference can have a big
impact on how much it costs to compete effectively. We talk more
about making re-buy and add-on decisions in Chapter 11.
Measuring Online 
Tournament Sizes
Because of the sheer number of players in the online world, you
can play any size tournament at almost any time and at any
game/limit type (that is, Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud in
fixed-limit and no-limit/pot-limit varieties). This section lists what
you have to choose from.
Playing just one person: 
The head’s-up tournament
You can’t find head’s-up tourneys in the brick-and-mortar world,
because the environment just isn’t suited for them. The game
would take up too much space and personnel (not to mention the
insane amount of card shuffling you’d have to sit through).
The online environment is ideal for head’s-up tourneys, however.
Shuffling and pot payouts are instantaneous. Sites take care of
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
156

blinds automatically. You don’t have to worry if the guy sitting
across from you at the table has taken a shower. You have found a
truly perfect poker world.
And pretty much all game versions and limits are available in
head’s up, although no-limit head’s-up play is rare (see Chapter 9).
No-limit Hold ’Em tourneys often end in as little as 20 minutes.
Fixed-limit Stud battles may take more than an hour.
To see how a tournament ends head’s up and to get an idea for the
way it all blends together, including the kinds of starting hands you
can consider, have a look at Chapter 12.
Diving in head first — at head’s-up speed
The action in head’s-up tournaments is fast and furious. Playing
head’s up is like having a newborn child — you just can’t believe
how much attention it demands. You may well see a dealing rate in
excess of 150 or more hands per hour, so if you sign up for one,
don’t expect to do anything else during that period of time. We
don’t advise playing multiple tables during any event, but you
should never play head’s up on one table and try to sit in any game
on another table at the same time.
Something about the head’s-up format brings out both the best and
the worst in people. Out of all online poker variations, we’ve met
the friendliest people playing head’s up, but the land of one on one
is also where we’ve found the biggest swine.
If you want to become a serious tournament player, get plenty of
exposure to head’s-up tourneys. If you’re both lucky and skillful
enough to make it through the field, you should gain confidence:
Head’s up is where all tournaments end. Play, play, play until you
feel comfortable.
Strategically speaking: Going head’s-up
We find playing head’s-up tournaments, especially at first, to be
amazingly disconcerting. The whole world consists of you and
another guy. He bets. Now what?
Because head’s-up tournaments exist almost exclusively in the
online realm, not much has been written about strategy (yet). But
we can provide a bit of advice:
 Don’t try to win every hand. We know, it sounds kinda weird,
but you may find it real easy in head’s-up play to roll your
eyes back in your head and drop into kill-kill-kill mode.
Remember, the chips you win, not the number of hands, deter-
mine the victor. If you try to win every hand, you’ll lose too
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 157

much when you try to press through mediocre cards. It all
goes back to the fundamental rule of economics: Maximize
your wins and minimize your losses.
 Make your winning hands count big and your losing hands
count little. Especially when you call bets, always take a look
at the amount you have to risk to cover any bet you’ve already
made — if it seems unreasonable, especially for a marginal
call, drop the hand and wait for better cards.
 Don’t reveal your pre-flop hand through your betting. Bet fair
hands exactly the same way you bet your strongest hands.
You want to keep your opponent guessing as much as reason-
ably possible. The harder it is for her to figure you out, the
tougher it is for her to develop a strategy to beat you. (See
Chapter 6 for more on disguising your play.)
 Pay special attention to variations in your opponent’s betting.
If she always raises pre-flop by a single bet and then suddenly
raises five times the blind, let the hand go because she proba-
bly has something good.
 If you win a string of hands in a row, become more and more
willing to fold any given hand to your opponent. The psycho-
logical strangeness of losing several hands in a row is tough,
and players are more likely to bite you harder when they get a
hand if they haven’t eaten in a long while. To combat this
blind aggression, let go of the occasional hand so you can ulti-
mately win more. If you thought your opponent was frustrated
when he couldn’t get a hand, imagine if you fold right away
when he has A-A.
 If you run across an opponent who seems to want to push all-
in or over bets every hand, play super tight. Fold everything
until you hold extremely strong starting cards (Hold ’Em: A-8
or better or a pair of 9s or better; Seven-Card Stud: pair of 9s
or better or three cards 10 or higher; Omaha: four cards 10 or
better or a pair of 10s or better) and then fire back hard. You
almost guarantee yourself a mathematical edge this way, but
you should be prepared for the occasional bad beat.
Playing just one table: 
Single-table tournaments
Strictly speaking, head’s-up tournaments are just a specialized
form of single-table tournaments. If you exclude satellite qualifiers
(situations where winning a single-table tourney automatically
gives you a seat in a larger tourney) for larger tournaments in the
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
158

brick-and-mortar world (as well as some wimpy ’lil cardrooms),
you find single-table tourneys almost exclusively online.
Single-table, on-demand tournaments are simple: You sign up for
one, and as soon as the tournament table fills, you’re off and play-
ing. We have an extended description of single-table tournaments,
as well as introductory strategic advice, in Chapters 12 and 13.
Playing just one planet: 
Multi-table tournaments
Multi-table tournaments are always scheduled tournaments that
you sign up for ahead of time during a registration period (any-
where from an hour to several days; the tournament lobby where
you sign up on the site always has details). Sometimes they have
caps with the maximum number of people and sometimes not.
The number of players determines the number of tables in the
tournament. Ten thousand players in a tournament require
1,000 tables. As soon as 10 players bust out of the tourney, the
site breaks down one table and puts all the players from that table
in the holes left by the eliminated players in a process called re-
balancing. Re-balancing continues until 10 players remain at the
final table.
Although multi-table tournaments do exist in the brick-and-mortar
world, the size of these tourneys in the online world is unmatched.
The most popular sites routinely draw tournaments with more
than 5,000 players (especially if the entry fee is $5 or less).
Because of the number of entrants, if great play and good fortune
are on your side, you can take a few dollars and win big. To give
you some idea, a recent $2 entry no-limit Hold ’Em tournament
paid $1,000 to the winner. A more lucrative big brother, a $215
entry-fee affair, paid $90,000 to the top dog. Not bad for a week-
end’s worth of work.
You can also parlay tournament success in the Internet world into
brick-and-mortar tournament entries. The ultimate winners of both
the 2003 and 2004 World Series of Poker $10,000 main event in Las
Vegas won their WSOP seats from multi-table events in the cyber
poker world. The 2003 winner paid $40 for a tournament that
granted a $10,000 entry seat in the WSOP. He ended up winning the
WSOP and over $2 million in cash. These kinds of parlays exist in
the brick-and-mortar world as well, but right now they enjoy the
most popularity on the Net.

Choosing an Online Tournament
With all the tournament choices, you may feel like a kid in a too-
many-flavors ice cream store. We have a few comments and ideas
that may help you decide what’s right for you. (And no, you don’t
have to pick vanilla just because your brother did.)
Picking your game
You need to decide what you want to play and how much money
you want to play for.
Finding a good stake
If you’ve never played tournament poker before, play one free-roll
(see the section “Examining Online Tournament Types” earlier in
this chapter) just to get a feel for the tournament dynamic. Don’t
expect to gain any poker prowess in a free-roll. You just want to get
a feel for the way tourneys work. After you get comfortable, move
to something with a small entry fee (less than $5). The small entry
fee eliminates the free-playing riff-raff (free-play games can become
glorified versions of bingo because of loose, bad play), and you
actually gain some true poker experience.
If you do have tournament poker experience, and you’re already
comfortable playing online, try playing a tournament with an entry
fee at about half of what you normally play in the brick-and-mortar
world. That amount puts you in the right general caliber of play,
but if something goes horribly wrong, you haven’t ditched too
large an entry fee.
From an entry fee perspective, you should remember that online
tournaments go much more quickly. If you’re used to playing $200
brick-and-mortar events where you essentially wile your hours
away on a Sunday afternoon with your buddies, you may feel
pretty unsatisfied after blowing $200 online in less than an hour.
If you want to feel like you get your money’s worth, play in large
multi-table tourneys or divide the number of dollars you typically
spend in a tournament by six and play in different single-table
matches. For elapsed time, you can better spend your $200
bankroll among $30 to $35 entry-fee single-table tournaments
rather than on a sole $200 tourney.
Be prepared for large swings in your bankroll if all you play are
tourneys. You shouldn’t play at any stake that you don’t have at
least 20 entries for. If you lose 25 percent of your initial stake, back
down one entry-fee level before you keep playing.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments

Seeking the right tournament
Picking the right poker tournament is like picking the right pair
of jeans — you want to be satisfied with something that suits
you best.
If you haven’t played in tournaments before, don’t assume that the
hand value and type that you typically play in ring games are the
same as what you play in tournaments — especially in pot-limit
Omaha High and no-limit Hold ’Em. If you’re familiar with these
ring games, play several tourneys at the lowest stakes possible or
just observe several games at the stakes you want to play to get a
feel for what’s actually a “playable” hand. Trust us, doing so saves
you dough.
With the exception of head’s-up play tourneys, which are relatively
new in the poker world (thanks to the Net), tons of books cover
tournament poker play in the brick-and-mortar world. All the
theory applies just as readily to the online world, and if you’re a
serious player (or want to be), you should buy some books and
study up. (We cover some great book sources and forums where
you can read people’s opinions about what’s best in Chapter 16.)
The single-table pros and cons
Red’s favorite tournaments are the single full-table (and on some
sites, double-table) tournaments. They always finish in less than
90 minutes (often in less than an hour). The game dynamic changes
as players are eliminated from the table, making the action more
interesting. Also, if you get caught by a bad beat (as you inevitably
will at some point), you haven’t poured hours into a single game
only to get your money taken away by the turn of a very unfriendly
card. And because you only play against one table full of folks, you
win money more often.
The downside of single-table tournaments is that you can’t win as
much as you can in larger tournaments. The top prize, typically, is
the amount of your entry fee times five. (We cover single-table
tournaments extensively in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The multi-table ins and outs
If you’re hunting down the big money, and you don’t mind going
through long dry spells, multi-table tournaments are the only way
to go. A big advantage is that your general table strategy doesn’t
have to change much, because these tournaments can be so large
that it takes hours to see the table sizes diminish — even by as
much as one player.
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 161

Just as in the brick-and-mortar world, during multi-table tourneys
you want to keep an eye on your stack size, both relative to your
table and to the tournament at large. One great thing about the
online world is that all sites calculate the average stack size in the
tournament to give you an easy way to judge how you’re doing rel-
ative to other players (a much better indicator than your stack’s
standing relative to the current top dog). All this information is
available to you in your tournament’s lobby (the place where you
signed up) as you play.
The head’s-up ups and downs
If you plan to play multi-table tournaments, you need to sharpen
your head’s-up skills. Although you may not need them very often,
it makes a huge difference in how you fare when you do (because
first place often takes home almost twice as much prize money as
second).
Head’s-up skills are vitally important for single-table tourneys
because, from a raw probability point of view, you have a 1-in-5
chance (2 people of the 10 starters) of playing head’s up. Those
odds increase, obviously, as your play sharpens.
Finding play where you 
have the edge
Most tournaments tack on a tournament registration fee to the
player of something around 10 percent of the entry fee to enter.
(Your poker site takes the registration fee as a rake for the tour-
ney.) This means you typically have to do 10 percent better than
average just to break even. Not such great odds.
You can, however, find ways around this to put the odds in your
favor. Look for tournaments that have added or guaranteed funds.
These tend to be more common on the lesser-populated sites that
want to gain players. For example, you may find a tournament with
a $10 entry fee, a $1 registration fee, and $100 the site adds to the
prize pool.
If only 20 people play in the tournament, the house essentially puts
in $5 extra per person. That means that although you put in a
grand total of $11 to play, the amount put in for every player is $15
(your $10 entry fee plus the $5 the site adds for you). You get a
great deal because, in a strict math sense, every person on average
makes $4 ($15 paid to every player minus the $11 you use to enter).
Try to find this great deal, rivaled in pure mathematics only by the
free-roll, by seeking out the lesser-populated sites.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
162

To encourage the first players to sign up, tournaments often have
guaranteed prize pools, representing the minimum amount that the
site spreads out among the successful players. If the number of
entry fees doesn’t add up to the guarantee, the site adds enough to
get there. Of course, the tournament hosts hope to entice more
than enough entrants to achieve the prize pool size that they
promise.
A situation where the money coming out of a tournament is bigger
than the money going in (remembering to add in the registration
fees) is called positive expectation by math-heads.
To assure that you’re in a positive expectation situation, make sure
the total prize pool is bigger than all entry and registration fees
combined, and then enter the tournament very close to the cut-off
time. You don’t want a sudden surge of players at the end to elimi-
nate your possible profits.
Positive expectation tourneys tend to happen most frequently in
Omaha and Stud. Because of their inherent edge, these tourneys
are definitely worth your time and effort to seek out.
To find a lesser-populated site, go to www.pokerpulse.com and
scroll down to the bottoms of the lists. Hit some of these sites and
see if they advertise adding any money to tournaments.
Chapter 10: Perusing Your Online Tournament Options 163
Recognizing a good deal
You’re interested in a site that has added $1,000 to a tournament prize pool. You see
that 323 players have signed up and paid a $20 + $2 registration fee. Is this tourney
a good deal (does it have a positive expectation)?
If 323 players put in $646 worth of registration fees, and the site pays back $1,000,
or $354 more than those registration fees, you’ve found a good deal.

Chapter 11
Clueing in to Tournament
Chip Standings
In This Chapter
 Keeping track of your chip standing
 Working your chip standing into your game
 Continuing play with re-buys and add-ons
 Hanging on as the money point approaches
T
he main characteristic that makes tournaments stand apart
from ring game play is your chip stack. In ring games, as long
as you have the ability to put more money down on the table, you
can keep on playin’. Lose all your money at the table? No problem,
just bring in some more. (Check out Chapter 9 for more ring game
info.) In the tournament world, you get a set number of chips and
no more. When your chips are gone, you’re out.Usually.
The situation isn’t always cut and dried. You may encounter a spe-
cific mutated little critter known as a re-buy tournament: a certain
type of multi-table affair where if you get busted out, you can buy
more chips, come back from the grave, and keep playing. And
some of these re-buy tourneys have a sick and twisted variation
known as an add-on, where you can add the amount of your buy-in
to your stack one time at a discounted rate. (See Chapter 10 for
more about re-buys and add-ons.)
One fascinating characteristic of tournament play is that your chip
standing can (and should) affect your poker play. Your standing
changes the types of hands you play, the amount you bet, and the
calling decisions you make.
In this chapter, we help you make sense of it all. We give you some
advice on how to get the most value for your chip dollar. We toss
out some tips for improving your small stack and how to maneuver
through a re-buy tournament. And we also give you some tips on

how to hang in there until you make it to the money. After all, they
say the worst place to finish in a tourney is one out of the money
(and if you have, you know what we mean.)
Making Sense of Your
Chip Standing
Your chip standing is your money position relative to everyone else
in a tournament. If you’re familiar with brick-and-mortar tourna-
ments, one of the tasks that can drive you slowly insane is trying
to understand how many chips you have relative to everyone else
in the tournament. In theory, players are always supposed to keep
their tournament chips in plain view, but players have found a mil-
lion ways to obscure their chips: physical obstacles like drinks and
arms/hands on the table; massive chip stacks (which hide yet
more chips); and sloppy chip mounds without definitive valuation.
Even if you can see your opponents’ chips, you have to be able to
count and evaluate them relative to yours. If you’re playing in a
tournament with more than just a couple of tables, knowing your
exact standing is almost impossible, unless you have the math and
observational skills of Rain Man.
Ah, but the beauty of the Net! You get your chip standing instanta-
neously online. All you have to do is look in your tournament lobby
window to see the full run-down on your standing relative to every-
one else, as well as an exact chip count for the entire tournament.
Broadly speaking, you should pay attention to four things:
 Your chip standing relative to the average stack throughout
the tournament. This gives you an idea of how well you’re
doing in the tournament as a whole. Your standing doesn’t
matter so much early in a tournament, but it becomes impor-
tant when you approach the money line and as the tournament
starts to wear down. If possible, you want to be no lower than
10 percent below the average stack. After you drop below this
level, you need to tighten up a little and make sure you maxi-
mize your winning hands.
 Your chip standing relative to the opponents at your table.
Your table position is hugely important — determining what
role you take on the table and what image you project — as
we show in the next section.
 Your chip standing in the tournament (7th place out of 135
players, for example). In small tournaments, including single-
table tournaments on demand, your rank is especially impor-
tant because it gives you an idea of your standing relative to
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
166

the rest of the field (if one player gets an early good hand and
knocks out two players, it skews the average — but not your
standing). Where you stand isn’t as important early on in big
multi-table tournaments (although you get a special rush by
winning a quick first hand in a huge multi-table and then
seeing your ranking as 1 of 5,000), but it does become critical
later on — your standing determines if you’re in or out of the
money.
 Your chip standing relative to the blinds (or blinds + antes in
later tournament rounds on some sites). If you have fewer
than 10 big blinds left, you need to drop into short-stack kung
fu mode, which we describe in the following section.
Using Your Chip Standing 
to Your Advantage
If everyone at your table has about the same number of tourna-
ment chips, and the tourney isn’t close to the money line, you
should play in your usual merry way. But when the stacks get out
of balance (and they will get out of balance), the balance of power
shifts, and odd things begin to happen.
Bullying with a bigger stack
If you’re fortunate enough to build a large chip stack at your table —
anywhere from 30 percent over your closest opponent — you get
some luxuries not afforded to lesser mortals.
In Hold ’Em and Omaha, you should consider raising any pot you
go into that another player hasn’t already raised. The reasons for
this strategy are two-fold:
 You don’t want to let the blinds see any cards for free.
For the time being at least, you run the show; therefore, when
you play, everyone plays at slightly higher stakes.
 Poker, possibly more than any other game combining skill and
luck, is a game of momentum.
When you’ve got momentum, you can feel it, and you seem like an
unstoppable force. And when you feel it, players at the table feel it,
too, and they become more likely to give you leeway. This strategy
holds true as much in the online world as it does in the brick-and-
mortar world.
Chapter 11: Clueing in to Tournament Chip Standings 167

By getting aggressive, you get a bigger investment from other play-
ers when you do hit your hand on the flop, and you play against
people who are far less likely to bet into your hand when you don’t
get the cards. You also have a better chance of clearing out other
players with marginal hands early on, thereby averting any freakish
draws that could wipe you out. This strategy is especially important
for both Hold ’Em and Omaha, where the betting is usually no-limit
or pot-limit.
We’re not saying that you should bluff more often with a heavy
stack, because as you win, you bring out the bad will of the table —
and you make those people want to come after you when they have
a hand. We’re just saying that when you sport a big stack, you have
considerably more big blinds you can play (no matter what the 
current blind is) than your competitors. Use your stack to your
advantage.
You need to be careful around short-stacked opponents, however —
especially in no-limit play. People with stacks less than five times the
size of the big blind are more prone to push all-in on you — so if one
of those people still has to call behind you, and you don’t have a
dominant hand, you should strongly consider calling the big blind
without raising. You don’t want to donate your chips to a desperate,
needy cause. However, if you have a very strong hand, the raise is
merited, because you may provoke an all-in when you’re a heavy
favorite.
Clawing back in short-stack kung fu
When playing any tournament size or type in both no-limit Hold
’Em and pot-limit Omaha, if you’re unfortunate enough to find
yourself in a smaller-stacked position (say, 30 percent less than the
nearest competitor at your table), the number one thing to do is
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
168
Big stacks in Seven-Card Stud
In Stud, a bigger stack doesn’t serve you quite as effectively, but it still has some
force. You should never let more than one single round check all the way around the
table. In other words, make sure you place a bet in every round, unless you have
strong reason to believe someone has a hand better than yours, or you have the
mortal nuts and want to extract as many bets as possible out of the opposition. In
theory, it takes a better hand to call than it does to bet; so if you make the bet, hands
of roughly the same caliber should fold. Over time you start creeping ahead of the
competition by being aggressive.

don’t panic. The most common error people commit in this posi-
tion is to lose hope too quickly and bet hands they would never
normally bet during more lucrative times (such as pushing all-in
with low suited-connectors in Hold ’Em, for example). Remain
calm. Yes, the odds are against you. Yes, the chips are truly down.
But wigging out doesn’t make the situation better, and you often
have sufficient time to recover as the world crumbles around you.
Because your chip-heavy opponents expect you to freak out, they
call you and your mousy little stack more often. For this reason,
you should tighten your play a bit and wait. Play only hands of
quality and never try to steal a blind (unless you know you’re up
against a confrontationally shy opponent).
This doesn’t mean that you should become timid. No, no. Think of
this tighten-and-wait time as your chrysalis stage. You went into
your cocoon as a somewhat wounded short-stacked caterpillar;
when you emerge, you want to be a feisty chip-spewing monster.
(Think of the Japanese film creature, “Mothra,” with its above-
average intelligence and telepathic abilities.)
When you do receive a good hand, bet it a little harder than usual.
You have ground to make up and you want the people acting after
you to respect your authority and fold or call so you add their chips
to your heap when you win the hand.
Chapter 11: Clueing in to Tournament Chip Standings 169
Short-stack kung pao (when you don’t
have enough chips for kung fu)
The short-stack kung fu works well in games where you’re short-stacked and can
place no-limit or pot-limit bets. But in fixed-limit Hold ’Em, Omaha, and Seven-Card
Stud, the situation is different — you probably don’t have enough to threaten
another person’s stack significantly. Even at your fiercest, all you can do is lay a
series of set bets.
What you need to do is find a decent hand and bet it to the end. If you pair the flop
in Hold ’Em, and the cards don’t suggest a large board threat (for example, if you
hold 9-9, you don’t want the flop to be A K Q), start betting and keep going. You need
to rack up those fixed-limit tourney chips.
In Omaha, if you have the nut flush draw, the nut straight draw, any trips, or two pair,
start betting and don’t stop ’til the river. In Stud, bet any starting large pair and call
with any medium-sized pair. Kung pao certainly isn’t as threatening as kung fu, but
when you have to gobble up some spicy tourney chips, it’s the only way to go.

But keep an eye on the size of your stack. You need to have enough
ammunition to shoot at your opponent to be scary. If you wait too
long to make some of your moves, you get callers you don’t want
simply because you don’t pose any immediate threat to their
stacks — no matter what you bet.
A poker truism rings loudest for the short-stacked: When you have
a winning hand, you want to maximize the amount your opponents
will give you. If you think they’ll call an all-in, bet it. If you think
they may call just a single, scrawny bet, go that route.
If you make a bet because you want an opponent to fold (for exam-
ple, you have a good hand that can be beaten by a drawing hand,
such as a small pair against two overcards), your bet needs to be
big enough to threaten your opponents’ stacks. Consider the stack
sizes of other players in the hand and think about how large a bet
you need to make to put a dent in their stacks.
Re-Buying and Adding-On Chips
Some large multi-table tournaments give you the option of re-buying
chips. After your stack falls below the initial buy-in amount, you
have the option of paying another entry fee to receive another
stack of chips. (For re-buy and add-on basics, see Chapter 10.) We
should tell you right now that we’re not fans of re-buy tournaments.
They often become nothing more than a challenge to see who has
the largest bank account, because some folks re-buy, re-buy, and
then re-buy again.
The ability to re-buy encourages loose play: “Hey man, I figure if I
lose this hand, I can always re-buy.” Which means that your bad
beats start to increase. Remember Red’s Law: Any numbskull with a
sufficiently deep pocket will eventually knock out any single-entry
player in a re-buy tournament. (Being a numbskull, however, doesn’t
increase your chances of winning the tournament as a whole.)
Understanding re-buying basics
In a re-buy tournament, you can make your re-buy any time your
stack falls below the original amount the site allotted you (although
a few tourneys allow you to re-buy at any time). The stack you get
when you re-buy is usually identical to the stack you received at
the start; so if you got 1,500 chips for a $5 entry, expect 1,500 more
when you fork over another $5.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
170

You can usually request re-buys by clicking on the chip tray (or the
action button for buying chips — see Chapter 3 for more about
control buttons). If you bust out, your site automatically offers you
a dialog to ask if you want to re-buy before summarily kicking you
out of your seat.
The re-buy debate is largely a matter of choice. When the time
comes to make the actual decision, consider the situation at the
table. If you’re sitting at a table with a generally sub-standard level
of play, and the average chip stack isn’t out of sight, you typically
get good value for your money if you re-buy, because you have a
legitimate chance at growing your stack and snagging some of
those old chips back.
If, however, play seems tough or your re-buy still leaves you uncom-
fortably under-stacked (often due to plenty of wild play followed by
many re-buys at the table), you should quit and try another day.
Here are two schools of thought on when to re-buy:
 Re-buy when your stack is about 30 percent of the largest
on your table. The underlying thought is that when you do get
a good hand, you need to have firepower in the form of chips
to back it up. This strategy has merit, particularly in no-limit
games, because when you have a good hand, you want
absolutely as much return as you can get on your hand. 
No-limit allows you to bet large, increasing your return.
 Wait until you lose your entire stack before you re-buy. You
may get on a hot streak and not need to re-buy. For another,
great power comes with being all-in. After you put the rest of
your money in the pot, you can’t be bluffed out and you get to
see the remaining cards for free. And if people fight with each
other while you patiently wait to the end, all the better — the
hand that could beat you may get bet out by another player.
Chapter 11: Clueing in to Tournament Chip Standings 171
Re-buy evil at work
To give you some idea of the evil forces at work here, a recent $5 tourney on a
large site had 600 entries, 950 re-buys, and 300 add-ons. This type of tourney is very
typical.
Good news for the tournament purse; bad news for any single-entry player trying to
slog through the tourney, because the tourney had twice as many re-buys and add-
ons combined than plain entries. This essentially makes the playing field three times
as large as it appears and gives every player two chances to knock out any given
opponent.

Knowing when to add-on
At the first multi-table re-buy tournament break (typically one hour
in), your site may ask you if you want to add-on to your chip stack.
The add-on typically costs the same amount as your entry fee, but
it gives you more chips. Add-ons are a one-time-only deal that
expires at the end of the break. If a $5 buy-in gives you 1,500 tour-
ney chips to start, a $5 add-on may give you 2,000 more. From a
pure economic perspective, add-ons are a good deal because the
amount you spend per chip is less.
On the surface, it looks like you’re often forced to add-on in order to
stay competitive with other people in the tourney. (And it has the
nasty side effect of actually doubling the cost of your tournament —
your $5 tourney now becomes $10, not including re-buys.) But that
doesn’t necessarily mean you should take add-ons.
You should follow one very simple but very powerful rule of thumb
with add-ons: Take them if and only if you expect to be below aver-
age after the add-on process and the add-on pulls you to within
10 percent of the average; otherwise, you should pass.
The vast majority of players add-on during re-buy tourneys. If you
have an average stack before the add-on period starts, expect to
be below average (possibly significantly) at the end of the break.
If everyone else adds-on and you don’t, all your opponents more
than double their original chip stacks while you sat waiting.
Having a stack over-and-above the average really doesn’t matter
because after the tournament has progressed, adding chips 
probably won’t raise your stack significantly enough to make a
quantifiable difference in your standing — especially in no-limit/
pot-limit games.
When you mentally calculate the cost of a tournament, you should
initially assume that you will pay for the add-on when the time
comes — because you can figure that everyone else will add-on.
Tip-Toeing on the Bubble:
Finishing in the Money
You may have heard the expression “on the bubble” used by ana-
lysts during the conclusion of the college basketball season. Certain
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
172

teams are on the bubble when it comes to making it to the tourna-
ment of the final 64 — on the bubble meaning they teeter on the
edge of being in or out. Poker tournaments aren’t much different
(only here, making the “64” means you get money). The bubble is
the point in any tournament of any kind or size where the finishing
positions start to pay money. For example, if 10 players are left in a
tournament that pays 9 spots, the next player out bursts the bubble
and goes home empty handed.
Your chip standing ultimately determines where you finish in the
tournament. When your tourney chip balance hits zero, the site
determines your finishing position. You clearly want to end up
inside the bubble where all that tasty cash floats around rather
than outside the bubble in that nasty day-old dishwater. Your chip
standing is key to determining the kind of plays you should make
on the bubble.
On quality sites (see Chapter 2), when you get close to the bubble
in a multi-table tournament, you begin to notice occasional pauses
as play goes into hand-for-hand mode. You get a message from the
site that lets you know when hand-for-hand play starts. At this
point, every table in the tournament must finish a hand, across the
complete tournament, before the site deals the next hand. Playing
one hand at a time keeps low-stacked players from playing slowly
in hopes that someone else at another table will bust out first.
You should try to ignore the bubble and play your best poker
game — because other people don’t. People often play extremely
tight as the bubble approaches, and you may have the opportunity
to pick up a few blinds because of it. Consider raising with any
hand you normally play pre-flop in Hold ’Em and Omaha, especially
if the blinds are short-stacked (if they have poor cards, they may
just let the hand go rather than fight you and potentially end up just
out of the money).
You ignore the bubble because your goal is to win the tournament,
not just a little prize money. Yes, everyone enjoys winning money.
And yes, winning money is always better than not winning money.
Weak, awkward, or timid play around the bubble, however, dam-
ages your chances of winning the Big Prize. You should make it a
goal to finish in the money; just don’t make it your ultimate goal.
If all players at the table are evenly stacked, and they all focus on
the bubble — but you keep your eyes on the bigger picture —
extra blinds easier to pick up. This doesn’t mean you should get
too crazy and overly aggressive. An opponent with an extremely
good hand should never drop it. But you should definitely up your
aggression a notch — especially if you can see that the rest of the
table starts to sit back and wait.
Chapter 11: Clueing in to Tournament Chip Standings 173

The exception to this is when you play in games where all the top
qualifiers get the same prize. For example, if you’re in a tourna-
ment where the top 10 players win identical poker cruises, you
shouldn’t care if you finish first or finish last; your goal is to finish
in the top 10. Pay attention to players getting pushed all-in. If they
go out, you come closer to the prize. (After you reach the final 10,
you can gain good final-table tournament experience without the
pressure of losing.)

A case study in chip stack ignorance
Perhaps no other story more clearly indicates the importance of chip standing, and
a person’s awareness of the rank and file, than a tale about the World Series
Qualifier Red was playing in. After six hours of no-limit Hold ’Em against a field of
thousands, Red made it to the final table with just two other players left. The top
two finishers received a trip to Las Vegas and a “free” $10,000 entry into the main
event of the World Series of Poker. Red had 225,000 in chips, his burly opponent
Action Monkey had 235,000 chips, and the anemic Tiny Tim had a measly 10,000.
Red was on the button, Tiny Tim had the small blind of 2,000, and Action Monkey (a
bully throughout the tournament) was the big blind with 4,000. Red was dealt A-A.
What could be better? He raised to three times the big blind to make a bet of 12,000.
Tiny Tim folded. Action Monkey paused and then pushed all-in.
Red squealed, as he is prone to do when excited, and called. What could be better
than taking away this brutal simian’s half-dozen hours of play? The cards were
exposed to show the Monkey holding A-K off-suit, automatically making Red a 93
percent favorite to win (only kings, a miracle straight, or flush could save the monkey
now). Favorite, that is, until the flop came K K 7, reducing Red to a less than 5 per-
cent chance of winning. The turn and the river were no help, and Red was elimi-
nated. Tiny Tim got to go Vegas. Was this a bad beat? No doubt.
But the bigger problem here (like always, it seems) was Red’s mental faculty. In just
a couple orbits of the dealer button, Tiny Tim would have been forced all-in. And
whenever Tim did make his move, he could be of no possible danger to either player.
Red could easily call with any hand against the small stack, and do so repeatedly,
waiting for whatever sweet final moment that Tim would play no more.
The right move here, even with pocket rockets, was for Red to fold to the raise and
watch Tim sweat it out. No matter what hand Red was playing against, he had about
a 7 percent chance of losing by calling; his odds of losing if he folded on the spot
were easily much less than that. (For info on how to find a poker odds calculator,
check out Chapter 16.)

Stay away from any fighting between larger-stacked opponents
when you’re trying to cross the bubble. If two large stacks start
going toe-to-toe against each other, they do more damage to you
if you get caught in the middle because your chips are more valu-
able. You have fewer to lose before you’re out.

 Slipping into short-handed play
 Heading into head’s-up play
You want pressure? Play in a single-table tournament. You want
fun? Play in a single-table tournament. You want to win? Read
this chapter . . . and then play in a single-table tournament.
A winning player is the person who can master all the dynamics
at work in the wonderful world of online single-table tournaments.
With a little study, practice, and a well-worn copy of this book by
your side, you can be the champ left standing. We promise.
In this chapter (and in Chapter 13), we cover the single-table bat-
tleground that you can often only find in the online world, and we
talk about the aspects of poker that you normally don’t have to
think about during ring games or until the final table of multi-table
tournaments. We’re talking about stuff like quickly diminishing
table sizes, wildly swinging chip stacks, and those pressure-filled
moments when you need to go all-in.
As a reflection of what you find on the Net, we show a heavy bias
toward no-limit Hold ’Em in this chapter. Well over 90 percent of
all tournament play online is no-limit Hold ’Em — the remaining
fraction is split almost evenly between Seven-Card Stud (which is
always fixed-limit), Omaha (both fixed and pot-limit), and fixed-
limit Hold ’Em.

Entering the Land of Single-Table
Tournaments
Single-table tournaments in the online world go something like this:
You and up to nine other players pay a set entry fee. After the table
fills up to the pre-determined amount (which normally only takes a
couple minutes), you get a pre-set amount of tournament chips. For
example, you pay a $5 entry fee and you get 1,500 in tourney chips.
You gamble these chips through the normal poker process (if you
don’t know this process yet, you’re reading the wrong book — check
out Wiley’s Poker For Dummies), and players bust out one-by-one
until only one person remains. That last person is the champ, and
we want that person to be you.
Recognizing single-table 
idiosyncrasies
You need to pay attention to characteristics specific to tournaments.
Unlike ring game play, where even the most clueless player can dip
into his bank account endlessly and keep right on playin’ (see Chap-
ters 10 and 11 for info on re-buys), the field in a single-table tourna-
ment dwindles over time because players can’t continue to refill the
chips they lose. When you run out of chips, you’re done.
As the crowd thins, the caliber of play at the table typically
increases (the bad and unlucky players get knocked out). Matters
get further complicated because the stack sizes between players
become massively uneven. The big, meaty chip stacks start to
intimidate players with thin and under-chipped stacks.
You need to recognize that blinds have a much greater effect on
you here than in ring games (where the blinds stay the same). The
blind level increases over a set period of time (you can see the
tournament lobby for how often they increase — typically every
orbit of the dealer marker or every 10 minutes). Because the blinds
continually escalate, they can eventually grow to a crippling level if
you don’t build up your chip stack.
Looking at single-table pay-outs
You can always find the pay structure of a single-table tournament
in the tournament lobby. With little exception, the payouts look
like this:
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
178

 Full-table tourneys (9 or 10 players):
• 50 percent of entry fees to first place
• 30 percent to second place
• 20 percent to third place
 Short-handed tourneys (5 or 6 players):
• 65 percent of entry fees to first place
• 35 percent to second place
 Head’s-up tourneys (2 players):
• 100 percent of entry fees to first place
• Don’t you feel like a middle child coming in second
place?
Developing Table-Size-Specific
Strategies
Single-table tournaments are unique in the tournament world, in that
you have to deal with decreasing tournament size immediately. The
decreasing playing field isn’t a slow process, and the changes in
game dynamics aren’t subtle. You have to stay focused and react
quickly, often, and with purpose.
In the following sections, we divide table sizes into three categories:
full, short-handed, and head’s up. As your table size changes, you
need to know how to adapt your play to each stage.
Searching for fortune 
at the full table
Your site of choice starts the full single-table tournament when your
table has 6 to 10 players, depending on the pre-determined limit.
Your strategy should vary, depending on whether you play limit or
no-limit.
Playing in a fixed-limit tournament
When your table is still relatively full, your game strategy in a fixed-
limit tournament is essentially no different than your ring game
strategy. Your starting hand selection and general hand play should
be basically identical. In the early stages, all you want to do is get a
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 179

feel for the various players at your table and take down the occa-
sional pot when you have a good hand. As the limits escalate, the
hands increase in importance because the bet sizes get larger —
mistakes early on aren’t nearly as fatal as mistakes later. If you want
to find out what kind of strategy you should use in general, check
out Poker For Dummies (Wiley). We talk a bit more about fixed-limit
ring game play in Chapter 7.
Taking on a no-limit tournament
In no-limit single-table tournaments, you need to be a little more
cautious with your play for two reasons:
 One big mistake can cost you your entire stack. (Remember
that in single-table tournaments, you only get a set amount of
chips, and after you lose them, you lose them forever — at
least for this tourney.)
 You don’t want to come out swinging until you get the hang of
the general playing styles of your opponents. The more infor-
mation you collect, the more intelligent your decisions will be.
(See Chapter 6 for more about both note-taking and figuring
out your opponents.)
You should be especially cautious if you’ve never played a no-limit
tournament before. Before you even play a no-limit tourney, you
should watch a couple of tournaments played in their entirety,
which — we swear — is much better prep work than playing in 
no-limit ring games or tourneys with free chips. Free chip play is
much looser than money play, and the differences in strategy
between ring game no-limit and tourney no-limit can be substantial.
(Check out Chapter 9 for some short-handed ring game info.)
Use the time at the start of a no-limit single-table tournament to
establish a table image that helps determine the way the other
players perceive you and your playing style. Initially, you want to
make your opponents think you’re the most solid, tight player at
the table, only betting when you have a great hand. You can take
advantage of this image later when you steal some pots by bluffing
with less-than-ideal (otherwise known as complete garbage) hands.
(Chapter 6 has more on how you define your table image in the
online world.)
Surviving the early, full-table stage of the tournament puts you in
position to go into chip accumulation mode as the table becomes
short-handed.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
180

Shrinking to short-handed play
Short-handed play consists of tables with three to five players left.
You have to react quickly to the changes that take place at this
stage. Because full single-table tournaments typically pay three
places, the tournaments reach a magical changing point when
you only have five players left. Players typically start playing more
conservatively, because they get their first glimpse of prize-light
glittering from the end of the tournament tunnel. And when the
light hits them, they start to believe they really can win money, so
many times (especially in lower entry-fee tourneys) they back off
on the aggressiveness of their play in an effort to score a little cash.
Your job here is to make that glittering light your opponents see be
coming from the front of your highly tuned poker express train. Take
over the aggressor role and run them down.
Shifting your play
With five players remaining, you should shift from playing a little
tight to being a little more aggressive, especially if the rest of the
table starts to tighten up.
Be sure to balance your aggression with the attitude of the rest
of the table. You want your play to be on the other side of the 
spectrum — aggressive when they become passive, tight when
they become aggressive. As best you can, always categorize and
identify the style of your opponents before you make your moves.
As a tournament field winnows, play in a manner that best beats
the player(s) you’re up against.
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 181
Avoiding an early exit
You’re playing in a $5 no-limit Hold ’Em tournament. Three hands into the tourney,
you’re dealt A-2 in the big blind. Five players stay in the hand with no raises, and
you check.
The flop comes A Q 10, giving you a pair of aces. The small blind pushes all-in. What
should you do?
Yes, you have the top pair, but you also have an easily beatable kicker (your deuce).
The board shows a freak straight possibility if the small blind has K-J, and any ace
with a bigger kicker currently beats you, as does two pair or any trips. Worse, you
have three people who still have to act behind you, any one of which may be able
to beat you. The best thing to do here is fold and wait for the next hand — all it costs
you is a big blind, which isn’t worth fighting over if you stand to lose all your chips.

Taking more risks
You need to take more risks if the escalating blinds start to threaten
you in a tourney (a much different feeling than you get during a ring
game, where the blinds don’t escalate). You need to put more pres-
sure on the stacks smaller than yours, and be more cautious against
the stacks larger than yours. Check out Chapter 13 for more on
these ideas.
Getting raw experience
We could type until our fingers bleed, but the truth is nothing beats
raw experience when it comes to mastering short-handed dynamics.
Practice on short-handed tables. Although the dynamic isn’t exactly
the same because of slight differences in starting hands, the way
betting changes in ring games when you essentially have access to
an infinitely deep stack of chips, the blind structure, and payout
tension, short-handed tables still have the ability to make you much
more comfortable when the playing field shrinks in a single-table
tourney. (For advice on playing in ring games of this size, have a
look at Chapter 9.)
Playing Short-Handed Stud,
Hold ’Em, and Omaha
So you have to shift your play, take more risks, react to how your
opponents are playing, and play in the opposite manner. Now what?
For the low-down on short-handed play in the big three games —
Seven-Card Stud, Hold ’Em, and Omaha — step this way.
Looking at Seven-Card Stud
Seven-Card Stud isn’t nearly as complicated as Hold ’Em or Omaha,
because the cards trickle out in a steady one-by-one fashion. To
win during short-handed play, we suggest you consider playing
more hands of slightly lesser quality than you normally play at a
full table.
If you usually start only with a pair at a full table, a hand like A-K-10
may be reasonable now, because the decreased playing field makes
for fewer dominant starting hands. Make sure that you always raise
the bring-in hand in any pot you enter. You don’t want anyone seeing
any potentially damaging cards for free. Any time you think you
have a better hand than the table, make sure to get a bet down —
even if it becomes obvious that you have a nut or near-nut hand.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
182

You need the bets on the table because you need to win chips at
every possible opportunity. You don’t play no-limit in Stud — only
fixed limit; so when you have a winning hand, you don’t have an
opportunity to sit back. You have to maximize the hand’s value.
On short-handed tables, you get correct pot odds for your drawing
hands less often. Flushes and straights, therefore, lose much of
their value.
Taking on Hold ’Em and Omaha
We group Hold ’Em and Omaha together because the game dynamic
is basically the same: You get hole cards and you bet; the flop comes,
and you bet; the turn is revealed, and you bet; and finally, the river
card drops, and you bet. Because you play Hold ’Em and Omaha in
no-limit/pot-limit variations, you see a considerable difference in the
play compared to Seven-Card Stud — one bad bet or call and you
could be out of the tourney (and the money).
Acting before the flop
Before the flop, in a tournament of five players or less (and assum-
ing all chip stacks are roughly even), keep the following advice in
mind:
 Consider playing less-dominant starting hands than what you
normally play on a full table. Because the number of players
has decreased, you have fewer chances to hold a very strong
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 183
Knowing when the odds are against you
You’re playing Seven-Card Stud with the fixed limits at 15/30. Only two players are
vying for the pot, you and Mr. Trips, and you’re evenly stacked.
Mr. Trips shows 8c 8h 10d Kc.
You have As 3s in the hole with 7s 9s Qd 10h showing. A flush possibility. From Mr.
Trips’ betting pattern and style of play, you put him on two pair or trips.
The pot sits at 30. Mr. Trips has just bet 30 on his sixth street card, and you have to
call to see the river. The odds of you catching the final spade to fill your flush are 9
in 42, or about 4 to 1 against. If you call here, four times out of five you lose your $30,
and one time out of five you win the $60 in the pot. Mathematically, over five hands,
the loss of $120 compared to the gain of $60 means that calling here is a bad deci-
sion. (If you’re unfamiliar with pot odds, see a basic poker text like Wiley’s Poker For
Dummies.)

hand; and you don’t need as much strength in your hand, on
average, to win.
If the highest ranked five-card gap you play from a middle
position on a full table is A-10, K-9 now becomes a real possi-
bility. When the field drops to three players, consider yet
another step down, such as Q-8.
 Assuming you’re not short-stacked against the rest of the
table, always raise the big blind if you’re the first player to
bring in action on the hand. You never want to give the big
blind a free look at the flop. Especially in lower buy-in single-
table tourneys, you can snap up many blinds this way.
 If people merely call in front of you, you should:
• In Hold ’Em: Raise if you hold an ace (with any other
card) in your hand or pairs from Q-Q to A-A. In Omaha:
Raise if you have a pair of queens or better, four cards
jack or better, or a suited ace with a different suited king
(for example, Ah 7h Kd 10d). In both cases here, what
you want to do is display to the table the dominance of
your hand and get a feel for what other people around
the table may be playing.
• Call if you have a hand you normally play in that same
relative table position at a full table. (J-Q in middle posi-
tion in Hold ’Em or A-J-10-10 in Omaha, for example.)
 If another player raises the blind in front of you, you should
call only if you have a hand you normally consider playing on
a full table with few players in the pot, and even then only if
you have at least an average chip stack. At this point in a tour-
nament, don’t be afraid to drop a marginal hand, especially if
you see unusual pre-flop action in front of you. It may be hard
to remember in the heat of battle, but the idea is to try to get
into the money and eventually win the tourney, not win every
hand. Focus on winning larger pots, not every pot.
 Fold in all other cases. You don’t want to try too hard and
press marginal hands into play; you want to take good hands,
maximize the money you can win, and minimize any losses
you may be unable to avoid.
When you’re playing no-limit Hold ’Em (or pot-limit Omaha when
the pot size is large enough) and the table is short-handed, re-raising
a player pre-flop is roughly equivalent to saying, “Please push me
all-in right now.” You can derive your own rules of thumb, but we
suggest re-raising pre-flop only if you have Q-Q, K-K, A-A, or A-K.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
184

If your opponent does re-raise you all-in, you should call with any
of these pocket pairs. Flip a coin to make a decision if you have A-K
(and pull out your rosary if you call), after you take into account
that player’s previous betting behavior (check your player notes —
see Chapter 6), because you may well be in a classic coin-flip situa-
tion: a pair versus two overcards. If, based on previous betting
behavior, you have reason to believe that player has K-K or A-A,
click that fold button double-quick. And, as always, if you believe
you are a better player than the raiser, don’t risk all your chips on
a coin-flip. Grind him out of the tourney.
Dealing with blinds
When the tournament gets to short-handed play, you start becom-
ing more aware of your blinds. Because fewer players are in, the
dealer marker orbits quickly, and your blinds per minute begin to
increase.
If the chip levels are fairly even, don’t try to over-protect a blind
from a player you perceive as trying to steal, especially if you have
a hand you don’t consider playing in a normal situation. You’d be
surprised at the number of times your opponent is actually betting
a strong hand (remember, the other players don’t want you to see
a free card from the blind position either). And you really want to
avoid being surprised in a no-limit tournament.
Keep an eye on anyone you perceive as a habitual blind-stealer; if
you see someone continually snatching from any of the later bet-
ting positions, fire back hard with a raise when you get a quality
hand. (Any time you do run across a chronic blind stealer, make
sure to make a note of it in the player notes — that keeps you from
guessing the next time you run across this person. See Chapter 6
for more on taking notes.)
The reverse is also true of your play in later table positions. If the
chip levels are even, you usually shouldn’t try to steal blinds from
the dealer position. Many people want to defend their blind bet
and, unless you match the board, you’re at the mercy of whatever
diabolical betting strategy they aim at you. Just wait for the next
hand. Your cards will get better.
If stealing is your game, you may have more luck from one position
before the dealer spot. You have to make one more player fold a
hand to successfully steal, but it makes other players think you
have a stronger hand. Just don’t overdo it. People eventually start
to suspect you’re stealing and decide to come after you.
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 185

When you’re the small blind
If you’re playing on a short-handed table from the small blind, and
everyone folds to you, you should:
 Call if you have any two connectors (6-7) or two suited cards
in Hold ’Em. In Omaha, call with anything (your drawing possi-
bilities are magnified and your opponent numbers decreased).
 In Hold ’Em, raise if you have
• Any pocket pair
• Any two cards 8 or better
• Any two suited connectors (3d 4d). Know that raising in
this situation is essentially a semi-bluff (you don’t have a
great hand, but you have great possibilities). If raising
feels too aggressive for you, or your chip situation,
merely call.
• Seriously consider folding all other hands. Playing mar-
ginal hands isn’t a good idea anyway, and folding gives
you more respect from the player to your left when you
do play a hand, because he knows that you aren’t too
stubborn to lay some hands down.
 In Omaha, raise if you have
• Four cards 8 or better
• A pair 10s or better
• Any suited ace
• A double-suited hand (10c 6c Ks 2s)
• Call with anything else. Omaha has enough variance that
any hand is potentially good after the flop, and the half-
bet is worth seeing what chance has to offer.
When you’re the big blind
If you’re the big blind and you face a raise (no more than three
times the big blind), call if you have a hand you normally play from
the middle of the field on a full table (possibly Q-J in Hold ’Em or
Ah 10h Js 9s in Omaha). If the raise comes from the small blind,
call if you have any of the hands we list for the small blind in the
previous section. Be ready to quickly let go of any hand that doesn’t
pair the flop in Hold ’Em or have tremendous potential in Omaha
(flush or straight possibilities).
If you’re the big blind and the other players simply call the blind,
don’t raise unless you have an extremely good starting hand or
you have reason to believe another player wants to limp in to have
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
186

a cheap look at a flop. In both cases, the underlying theory is that
you need to punish weaker hands for trying to play.
Hitting the Home Stretch: 
Head’s-Up Play
Head’s-up play occurs when only two players are left battling for
the prize. Head’s-up play can drag on, sometimes for a consider-
able length of time. This back-and-forth battling happens for a
couple of reasons. One is that players want to figure each other out
and find a weak spot. Another is that the hands tend to be weaker
(because only two people get cards), and judging how strong any
given hand is becomes difficult, so players don’t often bet heavily.
Even when you get a monster hand, you shouldn’t bet too strong,
because you want to maximize the hand’s value by not scaring
away the other player with a large bet. Much of the theory you find
here we cover from a slightly different angle in the head’s-up por-
tion of Chapter 9.
In the head’s-up world, you always have a blind of some size in
front of you. Typically, the dealer marker (and first action) rests
with the small blind, and the big blind (and second action) sits
with the non-dealer.
The following sections outline hands from the two possible 
positions.
Assuming you’re the small
blind, pre-flop
If your chip stack is roughly equal with your opponent’s and you’re
on the small blind, you want to make a modest raise (because you
don’t want to indicate the strength of your hand) in the situations
we outline in the following list (the situations translate to Seven-
Card Stud as well). The reason you raise with these hands is you
have a better than average chance of winning from the get-go
(exactly how big your chances are depend on your individual start-
ing cards and what your opponent has).
In Hold ’Em, raise if you have
 Two cards 8 or better
 Two suited connectors
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 187

 Any pocket pair
 An ace
In Omaha, raise if you have
 Four cards 7 or better
 A pair of 8s or better
 Any suited ace
Fold all other hands. Yes, really. In this battle, you want to save
your bullets for hands of value. The half-bet-size call isn’t even
worth it when you have junk.
At this point you may be asking yourself, “Let me get this right. If
I’m playing Hold ’Em and raise with 2d 3d, I should make a similar
raise with A-A? Are you insane?” The answers are: “yes” to the first
question and “no” to the second.
You want your head’s-up opponent to be befuddled and confused.
Leave him guessing as to what you may have. If you push all-in
every time you have high pocket pairs and merely call when
you have 9-10, you may as well just show your foe your cards.
(For more on camouflaging your hand online, see Chapter 6.)
Considering when you’re the big
blind, pre-flop
If your opponent merely calls your blind, you should raise back at
twice the blind if you have any of the small blind pre-flop action
hands we list in the previous section, because your opponent may
be trying to limp in and see a flop for a half-bet. If you follow our
advice and rarely limp into a hand to see the flop, you shouldn’t
allow your opponent to either. A hand of value needs to be paid,
especially when you’re playing head’s up. Don’t give opponents a
chance to draw and beat your stronger starting hand without
paying for the opportunity to do so.
If your opponent raises your big blind by nothing more than three
times, you should call if you have any of the pre-flop small blind
action hands we list in the previous section (give serious consid-
eration to dropping hands like 8-9 off-suit and the tiny suited 
connectors) and fold everything else. You only want to play
hands of quality against strong bets.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
188

If the raise to you is significantly larger than your big blind (such
as an all-in), consider calling only if you have A-Q, A-K, or any pair
jacks or better; all other calls are probably too risky (depending
largely on what you can glean about your opponent, as well as the
current chip standing and his possible desperation). Against the
very biggest of bets you only want to play the very best of hands.
Give yourself the best chance of winning. You often see, especially
in small buy-in tourneys, players push all-in with any ace and a low
suited kicker. If someone does, and you call with the suggested
cards here, your overall odds of winning are very high.
As time elapses, keep a close eye on your opponent and his gen-
eral betting style. If he seems to always call or always raise you a
set amount pre-flop, and then he suddenly bets much more on a
single hand, be ready to let your hand go quickly.
Be very suspicious of any player who merely calls after a long
series of raises in any specific hand — this tactic is a common trap
set by people playing high pocket pairs. Although you’re a poker
animal, you don’t want to get trapped and show up as a trophy on
someone else’s mantle.
Playing head’s up, post-flop
After the flop, the road opens up a bit. Make sure you put bets on
the table any time you have a pair in Hold ’Em and with anything
better than one pair or with a high flush draw in Omaha.
Chapter 12: Winning Single-Table Tournaments 189
Playing the pair-of-deuces blues
To show you the kind of trouble playing minimal hands can get you into, imagine
you’re playing Hold ’Em with 2-5 off-suit in the small blind. You call the big blind. (To
be clear: We don’t recommend this play; we recommend you fold.) The big blind
decides not to raise, and the flop comes 2 10 Q.
You now have a pair of deuces. You make a minimal bet, and your opponent raises
with half his stack. Now what do you do? You really only have two choices: re-raise
all-in or fold. (A call only gets you pushed all-in on the turn.) Do you really want to
call all-in on a pair of deuces? Didn’t think so. If you didn’t play this hand in the first
place, you wouldn’t be having this problem.

Place small raises any time you have a high board pair in Hold ’Em
(two pair or better for Omaha), outside straight draws or flush
draws, and get slightly more aggressive if you have combinations
of these hands that present good opportunities. Any time you
believe you have a winning hand, or something likely to be a
winner (say the top two pair in Hold ’Em or trips or better in
Omaha), get fairly stiff bets down but not so large that you can’t
induce a call.
The whole idea when you get to head’s up in the single-table tour-
ney is to winnow your opponent’s chip stack, and carving it up
slowly is just fine. If you rush at him quickly and aggressively, over

Pocket deuces versus A-K
In Texas Hold ’Em pre-flop, 2-2 versus A-K is a 50/50 proposition. (The true odds vary
from 50.3 percent versus 49.7 percent in favor of the pocket deuces to 53.2 percent
versus 46.8 percent for the deuces, depending on the suits involved — you can play
with the percentages for this hand, or any hand, on www.cardplayer.com/
poker_odds if you’re curious.) In the brick-and-mortar world, you usually don’t
see people push all-in with 2-2 — and a 2-2 call is even rarer — but on the Internet
such plays are much more prevalent, possibly because you encounter so many
newbie players.
And these newbie players are thinking: If I have 2-2, and somehow I put my oppo-
nent on A-K, given that I’m a slight statistical favorite, why not just push all-in as the
aggressor during head’s-up play (or even at a more populated table)?
Well, you certainly can do that, but the newbie isn’t looking at the problem the right
way. The real question you need to ask yourself is: Do I really want to reduce my
table match to a 50/50 coin flip?
If you have reason to believe you’re a better player than your opponent, you don’t
want to give him the opportunity to beat you based solely on chance — especially
when the odds eliminate all the advantage your skill holds. If you really are a better
poker player, the longer you fight, the more the statistical edge grinds in your favor,
and the more likely you are to ultimately put your opponent down.
Calling an all-in with 2-2 seems foolhardy and possibly suicidal. For all practical pur-
poses, any pocket pair beats you outright (you’re a 4-to-1 underdog with a lower
pair), and any two overcards are essentially an even bet.
We can think of a few situations where calling an all-in with 2-2 may conceivably
make sense: you’re falling asleep at the keyboard, your house is on fire, you’re about
to give birth, or your boss is starting to walk around your desk to see what you’ve
been doing for the last hour. You probably shouldn’t be playing during these times
anyway, so yeah, go ahead and make the call.

and over, he may hunker down until he has a hand that he knows
can beat you, at which point he proceeds to make a serious effort at
taking you out. By slowly bringing your rival down, he often won’t be
as aware of his impending doom. By the time reality takes hold, you
have a firm upper hand because his chip stack has become small rel-
ative to yours; and now you’re the heavy favorite. Now you can put
on the death grip and go for the kill.
In both Hold ’Em and Omaha, if you get a strong reaction to a fairly
large bet, especially from an otherwise docile opponent, read the
board closely. Look for possible big five-card hands (straights and
flushes) and be leery of board pairs that could potentially bear
trips or a full house for your enemy.
If you suddenly get pushed all-in by someone who has otherwise
been Captain Happy, never call with anything less than top pair,
and even then you should be like Aretha Franklin and Think! hard.
Show some respect. Be willing to call a bet you believe screams out
single-card flush or straight draw, but, as Elmer Fudd says, be vewy
vewy careful with everything else.
Making an all-in bet is a much bigger weapon than the all-in call.
When you place an all-in bet, you go on the offensive; the all-in call
is defensive. Be sure to consider this bit of advice anytime, but
especially as you near the end of head’s-up play.
Remember, you can always forget about playing a single hand. Fold
and play another. (But you may never forget the hand if you make a
fatal all-in call.)

 Keeping an eye on your chips

I
n a single-table tournament, your chip standing (how much
money you have compared to the other players at any given
point) relative to your opponents is the most important aspect of
your game. After all, the standings determine which players get
paid at the end of the game based on the order in which they lose
their chips.
In this chapter, we discuss managing your wildly swinging stack of
chips and knowing that gut-churning moment when you need to
bite the bullet and make your big betting move to win that single-
table tournament. After all, your chip standing bears a significant
impact on the hands you consider playing and the way you bet
these hands after you jump into the pot.
Analyzing Where You Stand —
Chips-Wise
You chip standing matters. It makes the difference between
what you bet on and what you don’t. So you always need to keep
a watchful eye on what you have and compare it to what your
opponents hold.

As you progress through a tournament, two players often acquire
larger stacks than the rest of the table. Watch any growing mon-
sters closely. If they seem to want to bully people a bit, try not
to get in the middle of any hand where they battle head-to-head.
You should always choose to watch Godzilla vs. Mothra from a 
distance . . . you don’t want to be one of the citizens of Tokyo get-
ting trampled underfoot.
Finding your chip standing
To find the up-to-date standings for your tournament, head to the
tournament lobby (see Figure 13-1). (The lobby is usually the place
where you originally registered for the tournament.)
Figure 13-1: Lobby of a single-table tournament in progress.
As you can see from Figure 13-1, the information is straightforward.
You can see the players registered for the tournament, as well as
the start time, the blind sizes (during play at any time), and the
stack size of every player. Although the information itself is easy to
comprehend, the way it affects the game is a bit more subtle.
Making sense of your position
To make complete sense of your chip standing, you need to con-
sider several factors:
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
194

 Any large discrepancies between the stacks
 The blind sizes relative to your chip stack and any small stacks
 Your standing relative to the other stacks
Pay attention to players with big chip leads or those falling rapidly
behind; both have a mild tendency to over-bet hands (the leader
because of bullying instincts and the trailer out of desperation). If
you have a high-quality hand, don’t be afraid to go up against these
desperados; in fact, you should raise when you get the opportunity
to show you’re serious about the hand.
Always have a rough idea of how many current-level big blinds
your stack is equal to. Anytime you have fewer than 10 big blinds
worth of chips, be ready to swing into the “5-to-10” rule, which dic-
tates that you conserve chips and then get aggressive when you
have a hand (see the section “Making your ‘5-to-10’ move” later in
this chapter).
Leading a single-table tournament in the early stages doesn’t do
much for you, aside from the mental comfort that comes with
knowing you’re not losing.
If you find yourself down after an early knock or two — especially
if an opponent catches you bluffing — tighten your play consider-
ably and wait for hands of high quality. Don’t guard blinds when
you have marginal hands. Again, you want to be conserving your
chips to use them only when they can get you more chips back in
return.
Using Your Chips to Your
Advantage
You can use your stack size to your advantage whether you lead or
trail in a tournament. Read on to find out how.
Playing with a lead
If you put yourself in a position where you lead a tournament sig-
nificantly (say, two times your closest opponent), especially after
the table becomes short-handed, raise every pot you come into
pre-flop in Hold ’Em and Omaha that another player hasn’t already
elevated. In this position, you play the troll of the table: No one
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 195

gets to see a card without paying the price for crossing your bridge
first. You don’t want to let people see free cards. A lucky draw can
be deadly to your stack, so you need to try to force people to drop
junky hands.
In Seven-Card Stud, if you take the lead, always raise any time you
bring in the action. Again, you want players to pay to see cards.
Because you always play Stud as a limit game, you need to get a
bet down on the table every time you appear to be winning the
hand, and especially when you’re chip leader.
Don’t try to steal any more blinds than you normally do. In fact,
you may want to consider stealing fewer. People are expecting you
to steal anyway, and like the tiny Lilliputians they are, if people
think you’re overly aggressive, you may get multiple table mem-
bers trying to take you down. After all, the more people who call,
the more likely you are to lose.
Playing from behind
Don’t sweat trailing so much early on, but be careful after your
stack size is half the size of any of your opponents’ — especially
when playing no-limit. The natural tendency of a player hovering
well above you is to think, “Well, if I call this all-in bet and lose, I
still have half my stack.” And if this loose cannon wins, of course,
his frivolous all-in bet wipes you out.
Having said that, if you’re down, but you still have a chip stack
that can put a sizable ding in the other player’s battleship (say
one-quarter of his stack size in no-limit), don’t be afraid to push all-
in with strong hands (such as pocket 8s or better). Two situations
can unfold: Your opponent passes, and you win the hand automati-
cally, or an opponent may call with a losing hand and double your
stack. You’re even more likely to be successful with this strategy
during short-handed play because you have fewer players to beat
or bully out.
Making your “5-to-10” move 
Not all battles go exactly the way you plan. Just ask Napoleon. You
can think, strategize, and employ clever tactics; but a cold run of
cards, a called-out bluff, a superior play by someone else, or an
especially unfriendly card in no-limit can leave you schooling with
the bottom feeders in Lake Poker. Face it: Only one person wins a
tournament.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments

When your stack gets low, your play needs to be sharp and deliber-
ate, and your focus needs to be on. The beauty of playing online is
you can mumble to yourself, scream at your dog, or make faces
like our favorite silent film actor, Buster Keaton, but all that comes
out over an Internet table is the purity of your play. So you should
make your plays good.
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 197
The danger of being low stacked
We witnessed an interesting event involving a short-stacked player in a recent
single-table tournament.
At the table in question, in a middle position with no previous callers, the shortest-
stacked player pushed all-in quickly on his turn. Everyone folded to the table gorilla,
who had three times the nearest stack size of the next player, sitting in the big blind.
She paused for a moment and then called.
As is customary with all-ins, both players exposed their cards. Mr. Tiny had A-A,
and Ms. Big had 3-5 off-suit.
The community cards rolled:
As 2d 7d 4c 6h
Mr. Tiny’s trip aces got crushed, first by a wheel (an ace through five straight) and
then by a larger straight (while Tiny hoped the board would pair for a full house).
At this point, Mr. Tiny went something close to insane. It was hard to tell exactly
what Tiny said, because the site’s profanity filter sucked down the majority of it and
replaced it with symbols, but you can safely assume Tiny wasn’t happy.
In fact, Mr. Tiny was so unhappy that he continued to moan as an observer for
another five hands or so, getting all the more infuriated by the fact that Ms. Big
refused to respond to his taunting in any way.
“How could you POSSIBLY call with that hand?” Mr. Tiny (or at this point, Mr.
Whiney, really) asked.
Here’s how, Mr. Tiny: You were the significant table weakling, and she was the big
table boss. The amount it cost her to call was negligible, and after you bust out, you
never return to the table. Was Ms. Big’s call wrong? We don’t think so. Any given
hand isn’t that much of an underdog to any other hand, and the amount she risked
bordered on the insignificant. She based her call purely on single-table tournament
stack size, not on hand value, because the amount that she could lose just wasn’t
that big.
The more short-stacked you are, the more vulnerable your hands become, regard-
less of quality. It sounds bratty, but that doesn’t make the statement any less true:
The best way to protect a short stack is to not let yourself get there in the first place.

When your chip stack gets to between 5 and 10 times the big blind,
you should apply the 5-to-10 rule (our name for it, not a common
piece of poker slang). The 5-to-10 rule means this: Always keep
track of your stack size relative to the blinds. When you have only
5-to-10 big blinds left, you need to start thinking about when to
make your move.
Making your move is the point where you decide to make a few
well-placed bets on the virtual table. If you win these bets, you stay
in the tournament to fight on, probably even growing a bit as you
go. If you lose these bets, you end up watching from the sidelines
and twiddling your mouse.
You base the timing and the severity of your move on the impres-
sion other players have of you at this point. If you’ve given the other
players at the table the perception that you’re a tight player, you
need to start playing a bit more loosely and get aggressive with your
betting. Come in for a few more hands and see a few more flops. Play
a tad more positionally (meaning you should be willing to come in
from the final betting spot a bit more). But don’t forget that you’re
running out of bullets here. If you do foresee doing battle over hands
where you don’t have much or hands where you could obviously be
outmatched, let your cards go before the battle begins.
If you’ve given your tablemates a reason to think of you as a loose
player, your task becomes more difficult, but not impossible. Play
only quality hands, and don’t play positionally. When you do get
a hand of quality, play it fairly hard, and if everyone drops, make
sure to expose your cards to show that you indeed had a hand.
You want to try and change your table’s opinion about your loose
play and show that you’ve learned your lesson and now play only
the good stuff.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
198
Conserving your chips for a better hand
You’re dealt 9-9 pre-flop in a Hold ’Em tourney, with a stack equal to eight blind sizes.
From late position, with no previous callers, you raise three times the big blind and
get a call from the small blind only.
The flop comes A K Q.
The small blind bets two big blinds worth, which is half your stack. Time to fold, move
on, and wait for your next move. 9-9 is a good starting hand, but the small blind had
something worthy enough to call you with at the start, and now three overcards
have hit the board. The flop is unfortunate, but you should let it go and live to fight
another day.

In all cases, when you’re within the 5-to-10 range and you have the
nut hand, you want to maximize the amount of money you can take
from the table. You need this money badly to keep from being
crushed by the treads of the ever-increasing blind tank.
Flopping the high flush, pushing all-in, and getting no callers does
you no good. You make more money if you check to the river and
then place the minimum bet on the end, picking up that single bet.
If you check through a hand, your challenger may get some cards
he perceives as worthy, and then all you have to do is make a bet
that your opponent will call and let the site automatically show
your cards during the showdown to prove his inferiority.
Of course, you shouldn’t get carried away with hands that have
built-in vulnerability. If you get too cute and try to bleed money
out of your opponent, he may outdraw you and bust you out. Only
slowplay like this if you know you have a probable nut hand.
If you do have the nut hand, and you’re short chipped in both
Omaha and Hold ’Em, don’t ever check the river. Make the mini-
mum bet (or if you think you can get away with it, the maximum
your opponent will call). If you act first on the river and you check,
especially if you’ve seen action earlier in the hand, your oppo-
nent(s) may well check through and cost you a bet.
Many players interpret these end bets as an attempt to steal the
pot and will raise you back. If you do get raised, re-raise them the
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 199
Looking at real-life situations
What’s an example of a situation where you should make your move? We thought
you’d never ask.
Say you’re playing no-limit Hold ’Em. You have 1,000 in chips left, and the blinds are
50 and 100. The pot is at 350. You have Jc Qd with one caller behind you who has
2,000 in chips.
The flop comes Kh 10h 9h.
The good news is that you currently have the nut straight; the bad news is that any
heart in your opponent’s hand gives him a flush draw, and you have to be aware of
the small chance he’s made the flush already.
You should push all-in, right now. Depending on your opponent’s exact hole cards,
and assuming he holds a single heart, you’re at least a 60 to 40 (at most about 65 to
35) percent favorite to win the hand. You simply can’t afford to let him outdraw you.

minimum amount. We say it again: You want to maximize the
amount you can take from this hand. You need the bullets, so try
to win as much as you possibly can. The more chips you win, the
longer you play and the better your chances of coming back and
taking the whole tourney.
In Seven-Card Stud, if all players have checked up until the sixth
card comes, make a bet. If you get called (but not raised), follow
with a bet on seventh street. Especially in lower buy-in tourneys, a
shocking number of people let hands go even against a mediocre
hand if they don’t hit their draws. After you have some success
with this type of betting, lay back and don’t try it again for several
hands. You want the technique to pay as much and as often as 
possible.
Playing hands of desperation
Nine out of ten players bust out of a single-table tournament. The
vast majority of these folks (including you at some point) are
forced to play hands of desperation. And although you see hands
of desperation in all tournament types, they happen much more
frequently in single-table tournaments, because the distance from
start to finish isn’t very far.
Desperation is the point where you have a very small chip stack —
so small that you may not be able to live through the next set of
blinds (the small blind and the large blind add up to more than you
have). You’ve now entered that dreaded area below the glorious 
5-to-10 rule, the crawl space of the beautiful edifice that is the
single-table tournament, where vermin, darkness, despair, and
’80s acid wash jeans live.
Say you have about two large blinds’ worth of stack left. You need
to look at hands very carefully, remembering that almost any hand
you call will get action from others at the table who want to see
you go down (as we describe in “The danger of being low stacked”
sidebar earlier in this chapter). At this point, the cruel reality is
that you’re not a threat to others at the table; you’re only a threat
to yourself. The key, therefore, is to treat yourself the best you can.
Hold ’Em
If you get A-K; A-Q; a suited A-J; or a suited K-Q, A-A, K-K, or Q-Q in
Hold ’Em push all-in (or raise in limit), no matter what the action is
in front of you, from any position. What you want to do here is win
with an extremely good hand in a last-ditch effort.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
200

From a middle position, add 10-10 and J-J to the list above.
Consider any K-Q, depending on the playing style of the person in
front of you. Again, these cards may be your best chance to win
and double up; from middle position, your cards don’t have to be
as good.
We think playing Q-J all-in here is a sucker’s move. Too many
anemic overcard hands (like K-2 off-suit) can sit with players who
may be tempted to call. More often than not, you lose to these
hands because you already have lower starting cards, meaning
you have to pair the board to avoid elimination, and when you’re
short-stacked more people are prone to call.
If you’re the last to act, with no action in front of you, push all-in
(or raise in limit) with any pocket pair, any two cards 10 or better,
or any ace. You want people to fold and let you win automatically,
or you want a fighting chance with a fairly good hand if someone
does call.
If you’re in a desperate position in the large blind, and the small
blind raises you, you should call with any pocket pair and any
suited connectors. We strongly advise calling with any two cards 8
or greater because the small blind may simply be trying to force
you out, and the amount required for you to call is one-third the
size of the pot — and nearly any two cards in Hold ’Em have a 
1-in-3 chance of beating any other two cards.
About the only time you don’t want to risk all your chips is if you’re
right on the money bubble and it seems possible that someone may
go out before the big blind gets back to you, giving you a real shot
at winning cash. (See Chapter 11 for more on bubble play.)
If you’re in the small blind, with no previous callers, and you’re not
on the money bubble, push all-in with any two cards 8 or better.
Merely call with low suited connectors, and if the big blind raises
you all-in, call that bet. You already have a little money out on the
table; if you merely fold, you give away a huge percentage of your
table life. You can’t just hand that over, especially not when you’re
desperate.
If you find yourself with a tiny chip stack after seeing the flop, and
you pair any part of your hand, push all-in or call any bet in front
of you, both in Omaha and Hold ’Em. Again, you’re desperate, and
the board has been friendly. Your opponent may fold, in which
case you win automatically, and even if he doesn’t, you may have
him beat at the moment. You need to maximize your return to have
a chance at making the money or taking the tourney.
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 201

Omaha
In Omaha, push all-in (or raise if you can’t get your entire stack in
the pot in pot-limit) with any pair jacks or better, four cards 10 or
better, or a large double-suited hand (say, Ah 2h Kd 9d). You want
the other players to fold and make you an automatic winner, or
you want a caller with a weaker starting hand. Desperation makes
you the most aggressive of all when your hand is “good enough.”
From middle position, add any pair 10s or better and any four cards
with straight possibilities. You need to maximize the return on your
hand. Your back is against the wall, and when you have a fairly good
hand, you want to lock, load, and come out guns a blazin’.
Part III: Taking Over Tournaments 
202
A sample short-stack exercise
Here’s some short-stack analysis from a limit game to give you a general feel as to
how basic poker theory applies to a real problem.
Assume that you have 2-5 off-suit on the button at a five-handed limit Hold ’Em table,
and your chip stack equals two times the large blind. The first player to act single
raises, and the next person (the player in front of you) calls. Now you have to do
something. Should you play or fold this hand?
The short answer is you should almost certainly fold. Take a look in more detail.
If you call and win, you’re guaranteed to get at least five-and-a-half bets for your two
large blinds by pushing all-in. If either the small or large blind call (psychologically
more likely because you’re the wimpy little person in the pot), your odds become
even better.
And if either of the blinds get frisky and raise yet again, you’re now protected
because you’re all-in, meaning you can’t bet or lose any more money. The other
callers have to decide whether to stay in, but you already made your decision by
putting all your chips in. Anyone who folds at this point just improves your odds of
winning, because you’re all-in and guaranteed to see all community cards. (Any
amounts over and above the bets you were involved with get split only among the
other players.)
The big problem here, however, is that your 2-5 is probably an underdog to every
other hand on the table right now. You need to do something, and you haven’t got
much time. Almost any hand you go in on is sure to get callers. If you fold now, you
know you have three more chances (including when you get the big blind) to catch
a better starting hand than this one. Like always, wait for better cards. In this case,
your cards will definitely get better — after all, you won’t catch many hands worse
than a 2-5. Even if you’re ultimately forced to go all-in by playing the big blind, you’re
almost assured of pulling a better hand than this one.

Keep your eyes on the odds you get with your money — you figure
the odds by comparing the amount of money you bet versus the
amount you can potentially win if a favorable set of community
cards matches your hand. Always be sure to balance your possible
return against the other hands you potentially have left in your
ever-dwindling chip lifespan. In general, when short-stacked, the
more return you can get on your money, the more you want to be
in the hand, but always try to balance this with your overall win-
ning potential.
Firing Up for the Final Stages
After you start the single-table tourney and make it past a few
opponents, you can start concentrating on winning some bucks.
Vying for the money
We know it sounds obvious, but the whole point of playing a single-
table tournament is to win money. Always, always keep your eyes
on the prize. Know how much money you can win and how far you
have to travel to snag it. If your stack situation becomes desperate,
but you’re close to the money bubble, hang on as hard as you can
to limp into the prize ring. If you’re the chip leader, push around
people who lie considerably beneath you in the standings to make
them nervous enough to start making poor plays.
Watching personality 
and play changes
As the game goes through its natural stages, keep tabs on the
psyche of the table as a whole, as well as the individual personali-
ties of your opponents. Know who plays more aggressive and more
timid. Watch for sudden changes in behavior. Take notes on each
player for future use (see Chapter 6), but don’t let your note-taking
get in the way of thinking about, and playing, the tourney.
Many players tighten up when the table becomes short-handed
and the money bubble approaches (see Chapter 11 for more about
the bubble). If you see your table tightening — especially if your
stack size is above average — step in and play a bit harder. You
can pick up some spare chips this way.
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 203

If you’re at least at the average stack size, on any hand in which
you bring in the action you should always raise at least three times
the big blind size (or single raise in limit). You’re not trying to steal
blinds; you just want to set a bar for people to start playing. If
everyone folds, you win those tournament chips 100 percent of the
time. You may be surprised by how frequently this happens on
lower buy-in tables.

Folding for dollars (and pizza)
Red once played in a single-table tournament resulting in an interesting theoretical
poker question . . . 
Four players were left in a tournament that paid three places. Although cards early
in the tournament had been favorable for our hero, they had gone cold for several
rounds. Aggressive players kept him from playing marginal hands, and the blinds
grinded him slowly into what the rock band Screaming Trees would refer to as
“Sweet Oblivion.” As a result, Red trailed badly with a measly 50 in chips against an
average stack of 3,400.
Under the gun, he found himself with A-K off-suit. The best drawing hand in poker
would normally be a welcome relief here, except for one small problem: The blinds
were at 100/200. This meant that even if Red pushed all-in, and everyone called, and
he managed to win the hand, he would still only win 200 (exactly the size of the big
blind), and he’d have to win the next hand to stay in the tourney anyway. Worse, he
would have to win next hand no matter how many callers he had here. So, in the
grand scheme of things, all Big Slick (A-K) offered was an earlier chance to lose
but no greater chance to win.
Red took his full time allotment, and contrary to the way his grandma taught him,
dropped the hand. But not everyone else followed suit.
In fact, the two most aggressive players at the table took this moment to slash
fiercely at each other. Both ultimately pushed all-in pre-flop. By the time the smoke
cleared, pocket 7s had fallen to pocket 10s, knocking one player out of the tourna-
ment and assuring Red snack money for the night.
The 200 big blind rolled on top of Red’s 50 “stack” like a sumo wrestler on a cupcake,
and predictably, both callers beat his 8-6 off-suit.
Think this is a bad ending for Red, the guy who won money in the tourney by fold-
ing A-K? Perhaps that’s a good question for his pizza driver.

Going for gold after you 
burst the bubble
When three players remain in a single-table tournament that pays
three places, the bubble has passed, and you’re guaranteed a
prize. From here, you play to determine who gets the top prize
money. Players now begin to play more liberally — they feel like,
“Okay, great, I’ve won money, and now I can play again.” If you see
this happening, tighten up a bit (remembering also that short-
handed play allows you to play many more hands) and play on.
(Head back to the short-handed section in Chapter 12 for more on
winning strategy.)
As with playing short-stacked, your intention should again be to
maximize every pot you win. You want to whittle your foes down,
pushing yourself into a better position. If you get a nut hand here,
or something that may as well be (such as flopping the high two
pair), bet the highest amount you think your opponent will call.
Don’t over-bet and lose money or under-bet and stifle your win-
nings. Your entire goal now is to finish as high as you possibly can.
Maximize the amount you take down with every hand.
When you inevitably go all-in, make sure you have a hand of decent
quality if you’re not the lowest stack. You should avoid flat-out
bluffing if you’re in a higher chip position because the desperate
may call you, even if they don’t think you’re bluffing.
Reflecting on the Tournament
Okay, win or lose, after your single-table tourney is over, you should
sit a minute and breathe. Before you go and compulsively click on
the next tourney to get even with the idiot who beat you on that
two-out river draw, you must reflect.
Post-tourney is the best time to sit beside the stream in your mind
and reflect on the tournament:
 What did you do wrong?
 What hands could you have played better?
Chapter 13: When Your Chips Are Flying: Single-Table Strategies 205

 Did you ever over-play or under-play a hand? What did it
cost you?
 Did you miss or ignore a nuance or a subtlety of the game?
Or do you know of a nuance you don’t fully understand?
 What worked for you and why?
We’re not talking about a new-age religious ritual involving years of
silence and riding a yak; we just suggest that you provide yourself
with a moment to bring the whole experience together. Yeah, some-
times your opponents get lucky, and sometimes you don’t, but you
can find trends in your play.
And right now, while your memory of the events is fresh, record
what happened in your poker journal. (What? You don’t have one?
Better turn to Chapter 5 to set one up.)
Spot the trends in your play, and you can get better; if your oppo-
nents spot them, you never will.

Chapter 14
Ten Common Internet
Poker Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Straying from your limit comfort zone
 Losing focus
 Gambling without experience
 Ignoring promotions
 Neglecting the note-taking advantage
T
he online poker world features many differences when com-
pared to the casino world, and along with a new form of poker
come many new ways to screw your play up. In order to achieve
online success, you need to steer clear of the potholes created by
your online poker inexperience. This chapter highlights the most
common mistakes we have seen.
Playing Too High of a Limit
At a full table in the online world you see roughly three times as
many hands per hour as you see in a brick-and-mortar environ-
ment. If you play losing poker, it means you stand to lose three
times as much as you normally would.
If you begin to consistently lose, backing down a step or two in the
limits you play eventually puts you up against opponents you can
beat. (And if that doesn’t work, back down more until you start
winning.) See Chapter 8 for information on how to determine a
good limit size and Chapter 5 to discover micro-limits.

Playing Too Low of a Limit
The online world gives you exposure to micro-limits — games like
$0.01/$0.02 Hold ’Em and $0.05/$0.10 Stud. Playing limits that allow
you to not care about winning or losing can cause you to hand
money (albeit small amounts of money) to people who do care.
The micro-limits can also instill bad habits in you for when you hit
the bigger tables. You should always play for fun (stop when it
becomes anything but fun), but you should definitely play games
where the money matters to you. The moment the money stops
mattering, you need to stop playing. (See Chapter 5 for more on
micro-limits.)
Playing Poorly Because
You’re Anonymous
Sounds weird, we know, but anonymity actually provides an excuse
for some people to play a poor game. In the brick-and-mortar
world, you can only dip into your wallet so many times before the
peer pressure of others watching finally gets to you — well, either
the peer pressure or the fact that you start feeling stupid after
awhile because you’ve lost so much money. In the online world
some people can’t find anything to be ashamed of, so to speak.
They simply go to the cashier and get just a little of that money left
in the account.
Don’t do it. If you’re losing, take a break. If you’re continually losing,
read a few strategy books and study some poker forums. Drop down
a level or two to lower limits until your bankroll improves, or maybe
consider another hobby. We know it’s harsh advice, but we’re think-
ing of you — and your wallet.
Playing Too Quickly
Future action buttons — combined with all the beeps, buzzers,
bonks, and bells (not to mention the occasional whiney opponent) —
prodding you to play make it easy to act too quickly. You don’t need
to rush. Take the appropriate amount of time to make every neces-
sary decision on every hand.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
210

You have all the way until the timer reaches zero; use that time if
you need it. Make your time management decisions out of strategy,
not out of haste. Check out Chapter 6 for more info on using the
clock to your advantage.
Playing When You’re Distracted
Playing online can be the equivalent of watching a drive-in movie
from the inside of a stereo store while a letter carrier drops mail in
your lap and the paper boy throws a copy of the daily paper in your
face. (And that’s assuming your phone doesn’t ring.)
Or you can make it a focused experience with you, your computer,
and all your attention directed in one spot.
Think about these two worlds and pick the world where you have
the best shot at winning . . . we’ll wait. Our guess is you picked the
latter. (And make sure not to stray from your focus.)
Playing Without the Necessary
Know-How
Reading this poker book is a great way to sharpen your online poker
skills and improve your overall gamesmanship. You’re already devel-
oping good habits. Now keep going and study more.
Even if you see a popular poker book out there that you already
know you don’t agree with (because of some theory or playing
strategy you don’t agree with), read it anyway. Your opponents
may be reading the same book (especially those focused on the
higher-limit games), and you should always strive to know how
they think.
A stunning percentage of online players have done nothing more
than watch poker on television, and they now consider themselves
to be poker experts. In the old brick-and-mortar world, people read
books between sessions, mostly to relieve their poker jonesing.
With the online world so close and easy, however, many people
think, “Why bother reading about it when I can just do it?”
If you don’t beat these beginners, someone else who studies poker
will, so it may as well be you. You can start by picking up a copy of
Poker For Dummies (Wiley).
Chapter 14: Ten Common Internet Poker Mistakes 211

Playing at the Wrong Table
The Internet is the most gigantic poker parlor in the world. If you
sit at a table where you just lose, lose, lose, you should just leave,
leave, leave. You can always find a game running at another table
(or site). Never forget: No matter how good you get, the world has
several players who are better than you. And you may be sitting at
a table with some of them.
One of the biggest advantages of playing online is that you can go
somewhere else without having to leave your chair, let alone drive
down the road. Take advantage of it. Sharpening your poker skills
as you win is better than improving your poker prowess as you
lose. Always. Give yourself the best odds of winning and move up
through the limit ladders slowly.
Falling into Common No-limit Pits
Playing no-limit is similar to jumping out of a plane without a para-
chute: The lack of safety doesn’t make the tricks any harder; it just
makes the penalty for mistakes more severe. Making a mistake in
no-limit can cost you dearly; especially in ring games, because a
session’s worth of play can be wiped out on a single hand.
Playing no-limit with no experience
A great way to lose your shirt in no-limit is to assume the game
dynamic is the same as fixed-limit. Bad idea. If you’re new to no-
limit, read up on the game and watch others play before you try it.
(And go back and read and re-read Chapter 8 of this book.)
Learning no-limit by playing
with free chips
You shouldn’t try to get in no-limit by playing with free chips. Free
chip no-limit play couldn’t be further from a realistic depiction of
the competition and essence of the game because of the sloppy
way people play. You’re far better off starting with small buy-in
tournaments or micro-limit ring games in hard currency, where
real money is at stake and the play is as real as it gets.
Another possibility for learning no-limit is to try pot-limit first. One
round of betting is slightly less cataclysmic in that game. Jump out
of a plane with a parachute, if you will.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
212

Assuming no-limit ring games and
tournaments are the same
Don’t make the mistake of thinking you play no-limit tournaments
the same way you play no-limit ring games. They two are different
dragons requiring two different swords. The starting hands you
play are different, and you get a set number of chips. On the ring-
game side, you can re-buy to your heart’s content. See Chapter 8
for more on the differences.
Playing Without the Perks
Think about it. If you were playing in one cardroom in the brick-
and-mortar world, and you knew that if you simply walked across
the street to play at another place you could get extra money as a
bonus, what would you do?
For some reason, people often pick one poker site on the Net and
then just stay there (as if they have to get out of their chair to go
somewhere else). Don’t hang on to one site if it means you can pick
up more cash as a bonus elsewhere.
You’ll most likely use a third-party holding company as your
money transfer agent, so you don’t face extra risk to your bank
account information by going to multiple sites. (In fact, facing less
risk is one argument in favor of employing a third-party holding
company — see Chapter 4 for more on the subject of you and your
hard-earned cash.)
Sign-on and special promotions bonuses are a nice inoculation
against the potentially debilitating disease of house rake (the money
that the site keeps for itself), and you can keep up on who’s offer-
ing special promotions by signing up for newsletters and updates
from every site you haunt. (Chapter 2 talks about how to choose
sites of quality and possible bonuses.)
Playing Without Taking Notes
Notes serve two very valuable purposes. The obvious one is that
the more you can keep track of the behavior and style of a player,
the more likely you are to beat him.
Chapter 14: Ten Common Internet Poker Mistakes 213

But you need to realize the hidden advantage: Taking notes keeps
you focused on the game. If you pick one player and really try to
figure him out, and you keep track by jotting the occasional note
throughout the game, you play at a much higher level.
In fact, note-taking is a good litmus test. If you sit at a table and
think, “You know, I’m just too tired to take notes right now,” you
need to ask yourself why the heck you sat down in the first place.
See Chapter 6 for more on note-taking.

Chapter 15
Ten Things to Keep in Mind
in the Heat of Battle
In This Chapter
 Watching your play against players of differing skills
 Improving your online strategy
 Paying attention to player tendencies (and your own)
 Pondering your play
I
mmediately before a shark attacks, it rolls its eyes back in its
head for protection. This mechanism helps make it a ruthless
killing machine, but it also means your favorite vicious fishy ends
up devouring a wayward license plate or tricycle along the way
because it can’t pay attention to what lies ahead while indulging its
primal urges.
When you play poker (especially in the online world, where you
don’t have to even pretend that you can act), your adrenaline flows
and your impulses fire heavily in the “hunter” (versus “gatherer”)
part of your brain. We provide some tips here that, we hope, can
keep those annoying license plates out of your gums.
Don’t Bluff Lesser Opponents
If you run up against an opponent who plays worse than you —
especially if he has a tendency to call most bets — don’t try to bluff
him. Your dunderheaded opponent may think you have the hand
you try to feign and call anyway because he thinks he can get lucky.
As a result, you end up losing because of his loose play. And that’s
not good.

Don’t Make a 50/50 Bet Against
an Inferior Player
Sure, pushing all-in in a no-limit Hold ’Em tournament with a 2-2 is a
mild favorite against an A-K suited, but why reduce your skill level
to a mere coin flip against a player you can beat in the long run?
Conversely, don’t be afraid to push all-in against a superior player
in a tournament. You want to have the odds on your side, no matter
how slim, for one go rather than to sit and battle it out for hours on
end with a player who holds an edge against you.
Don’t Insist on Winning Every
Hand in Head’s-Up Play
Something about the super-competitive nature of head’s-up play
really brings out the beast in people. We’ve seen an endless number
of players who insist on trying to win every single hand, as well as
their more mild cousins who push all-in every time they have a dom-
inating hand.
When you play head’s up, the whole point is erosion of your oppo-
nent. You don’t have to move your opponent’s chip stack to your
side of the table in one svelte move. Slowly but surely also does
the trick.
You don’t have to win the majority of hands either — just the
important ones. When Chris plays head’s up and finishes first, he
often finds that he only won about one out of three hands in the
tournament.
When you get an unbeatable hand, try to place a bet small enough
to stay within calling range of your foe and large enough to get the
maximum amount of money out of your cards.
Drop Marginal Hands
It gets frustrating if you keep seeing marginal holdings hand after
hand. The temptation to play them becomes nearly overwhelming.
Don’t.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
216

The only time you should feel pressured to even consider playing
marginal hands is when you begin to get short-stacked in a tourna-
ment. Any other time, especially in ring games, keep clicking your
hand straight to the trash heap.
Chant it like a religious hymn in the key of “A” (because it is): My
cards will get better.
Take Your Time
The speed of Internet play can whip you into a frenzy. Take your
time to make the right decisions, and ignore the incessant beeps,
buzzers, and bells of your poker site. You can make the correct
play in the allotted time. Take your time and don’t worry about it.
Don’t Give Up Prematurely
Players who throw in the towel before being eliminated commit
probably the most common error we see in tournament play. Many
players see their chips dwindle down to 20 times the big blind and
seem to go mildly insane and start making extra-large bets or call-
ing with long-shot draws. Although a 20 times stack may seem
small in relation to the number of chips you started with, espe-
cially if you catch two bad beats in a row, you still have plenty of
chips (if there can be such a thing). The game is far from over.
Hunker down and play the good cards. Let weaker mortals panic
and run. The time to get a little more frenzied is when you get
down to 10 times the big blind size and start thinking about the 
“5-to-10 rule,” which we describe in Chapter 13.
Play When You’re at Your Best
The beauty of Internet poker is that you can always find a game.
But this doesn’t mean you have to play. If you don’t feel well, you
just had a fight with your significant other, you seem overly tired,
or even if you just find your attention wandering, wait and play
later. You can always find opponents; make sure to be on top of
your world when they find you.
Chapter 15: Ten Things to Keep in Mind in the Heat of Battle 217

Pay Extra Attention to
Unusual Behavior
If your opponent has acted the same way for most of the game, and
then he suddenly shifts to something different, stop and think hard
before you react. This behavior often signals a trap. Examples
include betting the minimum after raising aggressively all night, an
unusually long pause before calling (or especially raising) a big bet,
or a push all-in from a seat that played extremely timid all night.
If the situation doesn’t feel quite right, it probably isn’t. Fold and
play another hand. Better to take a detour and find another path
through the jungle than to charge along on a path that may have
a pit.
Shake Up Your Play
Due to the speed of online poker, you can easily exhibit a betting
pattern in just a few minutes. If you have a tight style and often
check and fold when the board misses your hand, you should be
aware of how obvious your behavior is to your opponents. If they
saw you do that in seven of the previous ten hands, they may start
to take advantage of your predictability. Occasionally change your
behavior with little strategies, like alternating between flat calling
and variable raising a big blind pre-flop in Hold ’Em or varying
your betting style on third and fourth street in Seven-Card Stud.
You want to keep your opponents guessing as much as you possi-
bly can, but don’t get carried away. Make opponents pay to see
drawing cards if they have a chance to beat you. Don’t play hands
that may easily be out-matched.
Reflect
Win, lose, or draw, always take some time to consider your recent
session. What did you do that worked? What could you have done
better? What was your worst mistake? Did you see a play by an
opponent at the table that you thought was spectacular? Answering
these questions and refining your play as a result are probably the
best things you can do for your game.
Record the results of your reflection in your poker journal — see
Chapter 5 for a refresher.

 Reading online publications
 Keeping track of your play
 Surfing the Web for poker play
You have a computer (we hope), and it must be good for some-
thing more than just playing poker . . . like, maybe, enjoying
poker more? In this chapter, we give you a list of resources that
can help you improve your game, find out more about poker, and
just have plain old fun.
And we’re big fans of free stuff. Every resource we list in this chap-
ter doesn’t cost so much as a nickel to use or look at. So take the
money you save and the information you discover from the follow-
ing resources and hit the tables!
Card Player Magazine Online
You can find an online version of the popular brick-and-mortar
magazine Card Player at www.cardplayer.com that carries every-
thing the print version has. The site includes superb poker writing
by many of the top authorities on the game for both brick-and-
mortar and online players, a poker forum, a daily poker quiz, an
odds calculator, and much more. It provides you with an excellent
way to keep an eye on the poker world that lies just beyond your
computer screen.
Card Player also has special online promotions and free-roll tour-
neys where you can have a one-in-a-zillion chance to win huge
prizes. (If you prefer getting ink on your hands with a hard copy,

you can subscribe to the magazine for $39.95 for one year (just go
online or call % 1-866-LVPOKER).
The World’s Largest Poker
Newsgroup
In the old, old computer days before Web browsers (say, 10 years
ago), you could use a resource called Usenet; it was essentially a
super bulletin board filled with newsgroups of every topic imagina-
ble (along with a few you don’t even want to imagine). One of the
biggest newsgroups was recreation, and burrowed deep in its spleen
were the poker mavens. The group’s moniker was rec.gambling.
poker, and users came to the board to chime in about all things
poker (usually with a geek slant).
Rec.gambling.poker went through the mildest upgrade when it
starting using a Web-based front-end, reachable through the site
www.recpoker.com. But don’t let the fancy new paint job fool you
(and actually, the site isn’t even that fancy); underneath the new
facade, the bulletin is still the brooding mass of poker nuts putting
their two cents in.
The flavor and quality of the stuff you can find on here varies, but
the site is searchable, and pretty much any information you want
is here. You can find all the info on brick-and-mortar tourneys,
good online promotions, rising stars of poker, and so on here
under one online roof.
Be certain to search the site and read several postings before you
post an item of your own. You want to get a feel for the culture and
style of recpoker before asking a question, and especially before
adding an opinion of your own. Recpoker welcomes new users, but
the site residents frown on input from the uninformed and unac-
quainted.
Pokercharts
Pokercharts.com is a free service that lets you “easily record,
chart, and analyze your poker-session playing” in your home game,
brick-and-mortar, and online play. Pokercharts focuses exclusively
on the money aspect of your game — essentially like having a
super-accountant hovering over all your banking transactions. The
service is free and easy to understand, and you don’t have to be an
Excel wizard to use it.

Book Stores
Your online poker goals will fall short if you don’t have the proper
poker knowledge to back them up, and one of the best ways out-
side of experience to build knowledge is by reading poker texts.
Gambler’s Book Shop
Red loves Gambler’s Book Shop, physically located in Las Vegas.
(Where else?) Gambler’s Book Shop has been doing business for
40 years, and it rightfully boasts “the largest selection of gambling
books, videotapes, and software in the world.” Don’t be put off by
the plain-Jane nature of the Web site (www.gamblersbook.com). It
has many books that you can’t find anywhere else. Looking for that
copy of Konstantin Othmer’s Seven Card Stud Poker? You can get it
here, along with everything else.
You can sign up for automatic notification of new arrivals on a
monthly basis. And ordering online means that you don’t have to
hike through the 110-degree Nevada heat to get your poker print
fix. The only downside of the online version of Gambler’s Book
Shop is that you can’t treat yourself to a 99-cent shrimp cocktail
after you browse through the online version of the store.
If you’re unsure on how studying can help you, see Chapter 14
for more.
ConJelCo
Chris digs ConJelCo (www.conjelco.com). It also has everything
on the planet relative to poker (yes, yes, including Mr. Othmer’s
Seven Card Stud Poker), and the site has a great Google search
engine embedded in it. Check out the historical listing of the World
Series of Pokers from 1995–2000.
But wait, you get more!
It also has the Gambler’s Corner, where you can find information
about casinos, cruises, and gambling publications. Have 15 min-
utes to burn before your next tourney? Go here.

The World Series of Poker Online
Binion’s Horseshoe (now owned by Harrah’s) has been home
to the World Series of Poker (WSOP, www.harrahs.com/wsop/
index.html) in the brick-and-mortar world for over 30 years.
(In 2005, for the first time, the early stages of the tournament will
be held on the strip at the Rio; the final two days of the tournament
will be held at Binion’s.) The winner of the $10,000 buy-in no-limit
Hold ’Em event is considered the Poker Ruler of the Universe
(our term, not theirs) for the year. Binion’s online presence (www.
binions.com) has stepped up each year; in 2004, the site included
some live Net-casting from the series events.
Dreamers, as well as the deadly serious, should check here for qual-
ifying information and anything else that has to do with the World
Series of Poker after the event begins. (From time to time, you can
find the best available room rates at the Horseshoe here — always
worth checking if you’re headed to the Home of All Things Poker.)
Poker Odds Calculator
Two Dimes’ poker odds calculator (www.twodimes.net/poker)
shows you the chances of any set of cards you specify winning or
losing on any given pot. You can use the tool to go back and ana-
lyze hands after-the-fact with “what-if?” scenarios.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
222
When knowing the odds helps
You’re playing $3/$6 fixed-limit Texas Hold ’Em and holding Ah 2h. Only one other
player is still in the pot, and the board comes out 5h 7d Qh Kd.
From your opponent’s betting pattern and style, you put her on at least one pair. In
order to win this hand, you need another heart to hit the board (or maybe an ace)
to give you the ace-high flush.
$36 makes up the pot, including the $6 bet by the player in front of you. Should
you call?
According to the poker odds calculator, your chances of drawing a heart are 19.6
percent (9 hearts left out of 46 remaining cards). You risk $6 to win $42 ($36 pot +
your $6 bet), which is the same as 1/7th of the pot (14.3 percent). Because the
amount you risk is less than your odds of making the draw, you should call. If you’re
unfamiliar with pot odds, see any basic poker text, such as Poker For Dummies
(Wiley), for details.

Knowing odds is good in fixed-limit games where you can get an
idea of pot-odds (how much you bet compared to how much you
can win). In no-limit, the poker calculator is good for seeing just
how bad the beat was that you took.
The bad news is that the poker odds calculator on this site is
stripped down to the barest of bones and is a little clunky to use.
The good news is that it has deadly accuracy — useful for analyz-
ing Hold ’Em, Stud, Omaha, and even Draw. And the coolest of the
super-cool is that the site has a mini version of the calculator that
works on your cell phone.
Be sure to look at the sample hands on the Two Dimes’ Web site to
get a feel for what kind of information the poker calculator expects
from you to run properly.
Poker Analyzer
The somewhat hideous-looking software you get from www.poker
tracker.com does an absolutely beautiful job of recording, track-
ing, and analyzing your Hold ’Em play — even across multiple sites.
The tracker lets you
 Track your starting hands to see how many times you
• See the flop
• Raise
• Win with those cards
 Track your play by position
 Track your hand results (straight, flush, and so on) and how
much money you made with them
 Track your best and worst opponents — those you win the
most from and those you lose the most to
 Track the betting actions of every player who has ever played
against you
 Replay hands, sessions, or tournaments
With the poker analyzer, you can track your first 1,000 hands for
free; after that, it costs a one-time fee of $55 (at press-time).

Information Blood Hound
Don’t forget the power of a great search engine to find anything and
everything you want to know about any sub-species of the poker
animal kingdom. We like Google (www.google.com) because of the
speed, relevance, and the high-powered tools it has built-in (like the
ability to search for certain images and the ability to translate for-
eign poker Web pages from five different languages to English).
To see what Google can do for you, explore the links immediately
above the Google logo. Not only does Google search for certain
keywords on the Web, but it can also find images and groups that
match your requests.
Poker Potpourri
Without so much as even the slightest nod to David Letterman, the
Poker Top 10 (www.pokertop10.com) is a truly fun site where you
can find almost anything: Top 10 Online Poker Rooms, Top 10 Bad
Beats (and believe me, the beats you see are much more costly
than anything you’ve ever experienced), and Top 10 Bizarre Poker

Chapter 17
Ten Mistakes to Avoid 
during Live Action
In This Chapter
 Understanding how to play with real chips
 Figuring out how to handle your cards
 Knowing how to interact with other players and the dealer
W
e focus this entire book on differences between live action
and Internet poker play, and we hope we’ve covered every
little idiosyncrasy that the online world dishes out.
In this chapter, we turn the tables and look at common mistakes
Internet players make when they switch over to the brick-and-
mortar world. Every player should watch for these mistakes, but
you should pay special attention if your path has led you from the
home game world, to the Net, and finally to brick-and-mortar play.
One or two infractions typically result in a mere scolding from a
dealer or floor person, and a few of the people at your table may
get their feathers ruffled. But multiple violations can get you
removed from a game altogether.
Playing Out of Turn
In the online world, future action buttons can really spoil you. You
can make a snap decision (folding before you turn, for example),
and your computer remembers your choice, acting on your request
when your turn arrives.
But in the brick-and-mortar world, you must play in a clockwise
fashion, strictly in order. Keep an eye on the game and don’t ever
act until the person to your right has acted. If the person you’re
watching has a tendency to jump the gun, keep an eye on the next
player over.

Betting an Incorrect Amount
Many players in the online world cut their teeth on no-limit games,
but they decide to play fixed-limit when they sit down in the brick-
and-mortar world for the first time. They think that no-limit play is
either too expensive or initially too intimidating.
When you play fixed-limit, you can only bet set amounts, deter-
mined by the name of the game ($3/$6 Hold ’Em, for example). The
dealer may politely tell you the first couple of times you try to bet
too much, but he may not keep up the cordial attitude for long.
Causing a “Chip Tell”
As you already know, poker is a game where people try to find out
anything that may give them an edge during play. They often try
to get an edge by watching you to see if you give signs as to your
betting intentions. If players can sense by the way you handle your
chips or cards that you’re likely to bet or fold, they may modify
their actions.
One way to help thwart tells, in all games, is to not take your first
look at your hole cards until the action comes to you. Be careful,
however, because all eyes are on you when you peek at your cards.
If you have noticeable tells as you look, the whole table knows.
Exposing Your Hole Cards
Looking at your hole cards without letting anyone else see them is
something you don’t have to worry about online. But in the brick-
and-mortar world, you need to be aware of how you peek at your
cards, because your nearest opponent may be just inches away.
You want to shield your cards with your hands as you look at them
so your neighbor can’t take a gander.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
226
How to bet in fixed-limit games
If you play $2/$4 Omaha, you can bet $2 or raise another player’s $2 bet (assuming
your table hasn’t reached the maximum number of raises for the betting round —
ask the dealer if you’re not sure) before and after the flop. After the turn and river,
you can bet or raise $4. No other betting options are possible.

Nearly all brick-and-mortar poker rooms use all-plastic cards now
(as opposed to the wax coated cardboard ones you probably grew
up with). You can bend them fairly severely without putting a per-
manent warp on the cards. Feel free to bend them if it helps to give
you more concealment of your hand.
Remember, if you expose your cards inadvertently, the other play-
ers at the table aren’t likely to clue you in.
Showing Your Cards 
During the Hand
You may be used to the option of showing or mucking your hand
when you get beat online during a showdown. What some players
don’t remember is that you can only show cards at the showdown,
not while the hand is still in play, in the brick-and-mortar world.
You don’t even have the option online. Any time you decide to
fold and other players still have to decide, you should pass your
hold cards to the dealer face down and not allow other players to
see them.
This concept is doubly important if you don’t want to fold. In some
cardrooms, especially during tournaments, showing your cards
during a hand is illegal. If you show them, your hand may be
declared dead, even if you have the winner.
Mucking a Winning Hand
In the online world, if you have the best hand at the showdown,
you always win your share of the pot. Your poker site is all-knowing
and never lets you throw away a winning hand.
Chapter 17: Ten Mistakes to Avoid during Live Action 227
Sshh! Don’t tell
You’re playing Hold ’Em and you have the dealer position with A-A pre-flop. You
begin counting out money for a raise while other players fold in front of you before
you can act. A player in front of you with a somewhat meager hand thought about
calling the big blind, but after seeing your eagerness, she folds before you even get
a chance to raise. Your anxious behavior just cost you at least one bet.

The brick-and-mortar world doesn’t afford you this luxury. As soon
as you muck your hand, consider it dead and gone.
Never take the word of other players as to the value of their hands
unless you see their cards yourself or hear the dealer call the hand
out. Always rely on the dealer to call out the winning hand.
Making a String Raise
A string raise occurs any time a player first puts out enough chips
to call the current bet and then goes on to say “raise.” String raises
are illegal, and the dealer declares the raise portion void and
returned, making the action a call instead.
Any time you want to make a raise, you should say “raise” first. If
you’re too afraid your voice may somehow give you away when
declaring your intentions, put all your chips together and place
them all forward as a call and bet, simultaneously.
Leaving Your Hand Unprotected
When you play Hold ’Em or Omaha in the brick-and-mortar world,
you’re expected to protect your hand — typically by placing chips
on top of your cards (still face down, of course). The reason you
protect your cards is to keep mucked cards from being confused
with your hole cards, which could void your hand. (Cards thrown
down in anger by other players tend to be the ones that can cause
you the most problems and foul you.) Protecting your hand also
lets the dealer know that you haven’t folded and that she shouldn’t
take your cards.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
228
Mourning a dead hand
You’re playing Seven-Card Stud and suspect that the player opposite you, showing
four clubs, has missed his flush. You call his river bet with your straight and ask,
“Did you hit it?”
“Yep,” he says. You toss your hole cards to the center of the table, thereby muck-
ing your straight. He continues, “I hit two pair,” and he exposes a pair of aces and
a pair of eights. He wins by default because your hand is officially dead.

Stud players don’t have to protect their hands — mainly because
the players’ up cards automatically protect their hole cards.
Giving Advice to Another Player 
on a Hand
“Only one player to a hand” is a common phrase you hear in the
brick-and-mortar environment. Even if you’re no longer in a hand,
you may have knowledge of cards or something else relative to the
current cards in play that can give an unfair advantage to another
player.
If another player ever asks for your opinion on how to play a live
hand in a brick-and-mortar game, simply say, “We can talk about it
when the hand is over.” That keeps you from having any sort of
ongoing dialogue and politely indicates to your advice-seeking pal
that you don’t want to break the rules.
Forgetting About Your Dealer
Dealers are the people to go to for any question you have while
playing in a brick-and-mortar establishment. How much you should
bet, where you should sit, and the level of the blinds are bits of
info a dealer is happy to share with you. After you ask anything of
the dealer, ignore any other comment from other players at the
table. The dealer is the authority, no matter how knowledgeable
the other players may think they are.
If you want to leave the table for a moment or move seats, it pays
to ask the dealer about the effects of such a move, especially if you
expect to be gone during your next turn. Sometimes you’re required
to post the amount of the blinds or wait until the big blind when
you sit back down.
Dealers are commonly tipped a buck anytime you win a pot — two
if what you win is substantial.

Part IV: The Part of Tens

Appendix
Glossary
all-in: Any bet that puts every one of
a player’s chips into the pot.
bad beat: A poker hand where you
start out as the statistical favorite to
win the pot, but you lose because of
a lucky draw by your opponent.
brick-and-mortar: The phrase we
use to describe real, physical card
rooms where you sit across a table
from live human beings. It doesn’t
necessarily have to mean casinos; in
most cases, you can just as easily
think about any home game you
play in.
chip stack: All the chips a person
has at any given moment. We typi-
cally use this phrase in relation to
tournaments.
client: The name we use for the pro-
gram that you download from your
poker site to play cards. Chapter 2
has more on poker clients.
dealer marker: On a poker table, it
indicates the last player to act in the
betting round. The marker rotates
clock-wise around the table one
position at the end of every hand.
Because of this token’s shape in a
real card room, brick-and-mortar
players sometimes refer to this as
the button. Chapter 3 has pictorial
examples.
fixed-limit: A form of poker betting
where the amount you can bet
must bet a set amount at any given
moment. You can play Hold ’Em and
Omaha as fixed-limit games. You
always play Seven-Card Stud as a
fixed-limit game online. Chapter 7
discusses these games and Chapter
8 has more on limits.
free chips: Play money that sites
give you to practice with. Chapter 10
talks about free chips in depth.
hard currency: When we use this
phrase, we mean the money that
you have on deposit with a poker
site — the actual money that you
gamble with. When you place a $1
bet online, you put hard currency
on the line. We use this phrase to
minimize confusion with money as
a general concept. Chapter 4 is
where we talk about transferring
your money online.
high/low: A variation of poker
where the high hand splits half the
pot with the low hand (A 2 3 4 5 is
lowest possible hand — straights
and flushes don’t count against the
low, but they can serve as the high).
The low hand can have no cards
higher than an 8 (aces can be low or
high), with no pairs. If no low hand
is possible, the high hand takes the
entire pot. Chapter 7 has more
about this game variation.

Hold ’Em: A poker game where all
players are dealt two hole cards
with five community cards coming
face up on the table. Players make
the best five-card hand from a com-
bination of their two hole cards and
the five community cards. Easily the
most popular game on the Net today.
You can find more discussion on
Hold ’Em in Chapter 7.
no-limit: A form of poker betting
where you can bet a variable
amount, from a prescribed lower
limit all the way up to your entire
chip stack. You can normally only
find Hold ’Em in the no-limit form
for cash on the Internet. Chapters 7
and 8 dig deeper into limits.
Omaha: A poker game where all
players receive four hole cards with
five community cards laid face up
on the table. Players make the best
five-card hand, using exactly two of
their hole cards and exactly three
community cards. Look for more
discussion on Omaha in Chapter 7.
pot-limit: A form of poker betting
where you can bet a variable
amount, from a prescribed minimum
limit all the way up to the size of the
pot at its current state. Many games
feature pot-limit betting. Chapters 7
and 8 have more on this game form.
ring game: A single poker table,
with anywhere from 2 to 10 players,
where everyone competes for hard
currency. You can come and go as
you please in these games. Some
brick-and-mortar players call this
game form money play. Chapter 9
has more on ring games.
Seven-Card Stud: A poker game
where players receive two hole
cards, four up cards, and another
hole card to make the best five-card
poker hand. Chapter 7 has more on
this game form.
tournament: A special form of poker
where you pay a set entry fee, plus a
smaller registration fee, to receive a
set amount of tournament chips.
Players compete, busting out one by
one, until only one person remains.
Part III is where we get down with
tourneys.
