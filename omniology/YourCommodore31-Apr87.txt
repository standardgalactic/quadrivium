Argus Press Software is soon to release
the ofﬁcial Grange Hill game, entitled
Grange H ill — the Computer Game.
Spin off of the long running TV series
about a  comprehensive school, the
game casts you in the part of  Luke

without it for fear of the wrath of your
mother. So, you have to get it back.
What better idea than to break into the
school after everyone else has left, ﬁnd
your way to the sfaffroom and claim
your lost property? Well, it may sound
a little far-fetched b u t  that's  the
general idea.
With the aid o f  your pal, Hon°
Holloway (presumably supporting this
nickname because he has even less
brains than you), you aim to complete
your dirty deed by midnight otherwise
your mum will go spare.

people for generations. State of the art

romantics at heart? News has recently
come in of the ﬁrst online engagement
on Compunet.
The couple are Paul HurreII and
Margaret N o r t h e y .  T h e y  w e r e
introduced b y  C a r o l,  Margaret's
mother. She said " I  was chatting to
Paul on Party-Line at Christmas and

afterwards Margaret surprised h e r
family with a diamond and sapphire
engagement ring. The couple plan to
marry in about two years.
Margaret's f a t h e r  C h r is  s aid:
"When I  bought a modem, I didn't
bargain for a wedding
Paul s ummed u p  t h e  couple's
feelings about their  romance: " It's
thanks to Compunet. Living 240 miles
apart, we'd never have met if it hadn't
been for Party-Line".
On to the more serious aspect of
communications, B T ' s  Elec tr onic

Marketing. T her e a r e  t w o  init ial
releases on the new label: X29 Fighter
Mission for the CM and Space 2 for the
C16. Both are priced at E2.99.
X29 Fighter Mission is essentially a
ﬂight and combat simulator. Your
ﬁghter must be ﬂown with skill and
daring to avoid the constant onslaught
of enemy ﬁre and heat seeking missiles.
At the same time you must concentrate
on destroying the enemy craft.
Space 2 is a combination of shoot
'em up action and skill and nerve in
manouevering a  large space c raft
through dark caverns. There are two
programs on Space 2. The ﬁrst Galaxy,
involves a lost starship trying to return
to the mothership. However, there are
the inevitable galac tic  mutations
trying to hinder your journey.
Pilot X  is  the second program
where you must guide your large fuel
supply vessel to stranded scientists on
the planet Vogon. They are situated
deep underground s o y ou need t o
negotiate t h e  treacherous r o u t e
through caverns strewn with strange
obstacles.
Mastertronic is also launching a
new !able named Bulldog (best o f
British).
The company c laims  t o  hav e
commissioned some startling original
products for the new label which will
have a distinct identity to complement
the existing Mastertronic £1.99 and
E2.99 ranges. The ﬁrst title, already in
the shops, is Feud, at El .99.

The system works in the following
way: a small slot is cut in the case to
allow the dataﬁnder adjuster to move
forward and backwards as play and
stop are requested. A knob is attached
to a threaded shaft which replaces the
azimuth screw allowing an adjustment
of 180 degrees. Sound is also ﬁtted for
the Commodore 64 allowing the user
to adjust to the clearest data signal.

DIY kit available. If you're interested,

Notes on Utilities
Supersoft, the company which has
ardently supported the PET  series
from the beginning, has now fulﬁlled a
recent promise to continue to provide
software for these machines.
Fast Copy is a disk copying facility
for the 8050 and 8250 drives which can
drastically reduce the time it takes to
make vital check-up copies o f  data
disks. I t  saves time by  omitting the
formatting process o n  a n  already
formatted disk and by copying only
those blocks that have been used.
Available at the low cost of i15 (ex
VAT).
Blitz is a Basic compiler for the
3032, 4032, 8096 and 8296 computers.
Blitz has been available in Europe for
some time and has now been licensed
to Supersoft in  the U K.  Compiled
programs run ﬁve, 10 or even 20 times
faster with Blitz  and since they are
impossible t o  alter by  anyone who
hasn't got access to the uncompiled
original, they are also more secure.
Blitz costs £99 (ex VAT)and comes
with a  c omprehens iv e ma n u a l.
Additional versions on the same disk
are only DO extra, so for example the
8032 and 8096/8296 version would be
E129 altogether.
Fast Copy and Blitz are available
from Supersoft or on order from your
local computer store.
Staying with utilities but moving to

the C64, Systems Software has recently
published Oxford Basic. T his  is  a
complete C 64 Basic programming
environment and gives the user a full
library of powerful utilities including:
Oxford Analyzer, a report optimisation
utility ; t h e  Compr es s or  w h ic h
eliminates time consuming spaces and
REM, the Toolkit which introduces
new commands; Ox-Comp a fast fully
compatible Basic compiler to give you
the speed a n d  professionalism o f
machine code without an assembler.
The all-inclusive price is £34.95.

Commodore software writers with the
potential t o  bec ome millionaires
overnight
The man behind the hunt is Simon
Barnard, M ic r o Pr o s e  s of t w ar e
development manager. He said: "We
believe that the U K  has  the best
Commodore soft ware writers. And my
job is to ﬁnd them and offer them, not
only m o n e y ,  b u t  inter national
recognition".
MicroProse in the US spends in
excess of $I million in developing its
software programs. However. Simon
is n o t  jus t look ing f o r  simulation
specialists, he also wants programmers
of top quality arcade games.
Simon revealed his  reasons f or
believing that successful applicants
may s oon gain millionaire status:
"MicroProse titles remain at the top of
the US charts, literally for years, And
that translates into a lot of royalties,
besides substantial advances. S o  I
don't think it would be unfair to claim
that if we can ﬁnd someone who can
write simulation lik e Silent Service,
they could be a  millionaire almost

Britishers and our  US Buddies. Europe is a hotbed o f
Commodore enthusiasm and Germany is perhaps the heart
of this trend. It is ﬁtting then that this game from Ariolasoft
originally started l i f e  ther e. Ac tually  c alled Lapis
Philosophorurn, but translated for non-classicists, this is an
ideal starting point for new adventures and an interesting
diversion for more experienced addicts, unfortunately only
available for CM and 128 disk users.
The basic storyline concerns a medieval king, Hight
Gieselmer, whose stepson has been systematically poisoning
him. The only hope left to the old boy is the Philosopher's
Stone which has the fantastic powers of turning base metals
into gold and curing all ills to boot.
Your character is that of an ageing alchemist. You have

it. Make sure that you explore your home town thoroughly
ﬁrst. Leaving town may be a problem as the prince has
discovered the nature o f  your quest and the guards are
ordered to detain you, however, with the right object you can
hypnotise them into letting you pass.
One distinct advantage for new initiates are the HELP
messages placed in strategic parts of the game. Heed them
well as these cryptic clues may prove invaluable.
Most items which are available are included in  the
location description, however, if you go to the market there's
more choice but you have to think hard about what you may
need later on. Remember to SAVE your game position in
the early stages so that you can go back for anything you
may have omitted to collect.
The graphics ar e clear, colourful a n d  reasonably

If y ou ar e mov ing between locations the for mat

interpreter understands basic verb/noun formations but on
occasion a little more detail may be needed. One retrograde
aspect is the necessity to enter all words in full with very few
single letter entries understood. Two that you can use are
for Inventory and L for look to repeat a location description.
There is no R AM  SAVE facility but there are seven
named positions saved to disk. You will need these as in
several places death will follow the wrong move, for instance
if you lose a game of Hangman with a troll!
Although a most enjoyable game with lots to ﬁnd and
plenty of puzzles to solve. There are said to be seven different
ways to complete the game so perhaps experienced players
will appreciate that challenge. Deﬁnitely fun for all levels of

potential forces and get smuggled into the dome in the next
batch of cofﬁns. Your mission is to seek out and destroy the
Arch-mandroid at all costs.
Necris Dome is a somewhat simplistic adventure which
starts with you in your cofﬁn. The ﬁrst illogicality strikes
you straight away. Although you can see nothing in the
cofﬁn either now or when you open it, if you return to the
cofﬁn and close the lid, a pair o f rubber gloves has
mysteriously materialised. Nothing is guaranteed to put off
an adventure player (or at least this reviewer) than such
nonsense.

relish this ludicrous graphic adventure from Activision.
The game is set in the ultra (ass (trendy) world o f
Tonetown that exists in another dimension. Your favourite
old fogey, Gramps has built an inter-dimensional machine
and has got himself lost in Tonetown and it's up to you to
ﬁnd him. Helped by Gramp's dog Spot who is really Ennio
the Legend in Tonetown you must search this strange land
trying not to look too much like a total tourist.
There's nothing weird about the excellent adventure
system used to play this game. The screen display is split into
areas including a graphic display of your current location, a
text display (for text only freaks) and alongside them a series
of large icons through which you can quickly generate the
commands look, enter, hit, buy, get, drop, talk to, tell me

about as well as north, south, east, west, up and down. You
can also enter standard text commands use the predeﬁned
function keys to repeat commands and quicksave and load
game positions. You can even examine and get objects
illustrated in the pictures by simply pointing a cursor at
them!
The villain of Tonetown is an ugly green brute called
Franklin Snarl who would love to get his claws on you in
between his attempts to buy up the town. His antics to date
and other essential clues are packed into the latest edition of
the Tonetown Times that also includes adverts that will help
you become tass and the usual collection of curious small
ads.
lass Times is undoubtably a unique adventure featuring
the most peculiar settings, characters and descriptions but it
is also very good and will be Activision's best non Infocom
adventure. Remember Tonetown welcomes visitors but not
total tourists.

THE STANDING STONES
T
for the beginner without being too complicated. Set in the
ground beneath an ancient stone circle, the idea is to locate
the long, lost Holy Grail.
When you begin play you must create a knight. Go
carefully here, as it is important. A list of attributes appears
with random ratings o f up to 18. I f  you don't like the
numbers assigned, you can try again. The instructions
suggest that you only accept a character with at least three
attributes in double ﬁgures. In which case, why do they give
so many with less than 107 The attributes are: virility,
intellect, holiness, agility, and initial hits. These can be
roughly translated as strength, magical attack, peaceful
spells (such as 'heal' and Ielepore), agility is self explanatory
and initial hits indicates your ability to withstand attack.
Once you've settled your character, it's time to enter the
3D maze, where you must explore, ﬁght monsters and collect
treasure.
The maze must be mapped for you to stand any chance of
success. On the ﬁrst level a series of arrows points the way to
the exit. It is best to use this over and over again so that you
build up your experience. Leave it at your peril.

Apart from the monsters there are many useful items,
including magical books, chests, potions, rings, weapons
and armour. Unfortunately many o f  these articles are
booby-trapped so it's not all plain sailing.
When you encounter a monster you have several courses
of action: ﬁght, greet, bribe or run away. Fighting is usually
the best option, however, elves and gnomes will sometimes
return a greeting and gives you a gift as well.
Throughout your quest you have a companion named
Lancelot. Most of the time he is snoozing or sharpening his
sword but ocassionally he bursts into action and despatches
your present foes.
The deeper you go the harder the game becomes. Further
down there are oases which will restore drained strength but
they're not always in the same place.
The graphics consist of simple line drawings for the maze
and fairly basic shapes for the enemies. You may leave the
dungeons at any time to save your character.
Not a bad game if  you choose your character carefully
before testing the depths. Even then you should not expect to
stay alive long unless you map your route and this can be
difﬁcult due to secret doors and one way passages. The
Statuling Stones calls for a lot of patience, a will to live and a
lot of luck.

usual fodder for  a computer game but it's surprisingly
addictive.
This variation uses the 144 tiles found in a Mali Jongg set
(the ancient Chinese game) arranged in a set pattern that is
supposed to represent a dragon. The pattern rises in the
middle to a height of ﬁve pieces (the head) and down to rows
of single tiles.
To complete pairs that are then removed from the game
the player can only match tiles that aren't surrounded by
others which usually means from the head and tail, By this
method you must try and remove all of the tiles or at least as
many as possible either on your own, in solitaire play or
against other humans in a tournament game against the
clock.

Matching pairs can be a strain on the eyes as you stare
into the screen at an average of 80 tiles that are in view for
most of the game. The others are hidden from view in the
piles in the centre of the pattern which you must gradually
whittle down.
Mali Jongg sets contain 144 tiles split into three major
suits and craks, barns and spots (also known as characters,
bamboos and circles) three dragons, four winds and an odd
collection of" ﬂowers and seasons, As there are four of each
piece you would think that matching pairs would be easy but
you'd be surprised at the number of times you'll have a
choice between three pieces and have to work out which one
to leave.
Options at the bottom of the screen allow you to undo
moves you want to play again and even peek at hidden tiles
once you've given in.
At last an addictive strategy game.

he big day has arrived. Your  stay, courtesy of Her
Majesty is about to end. It was only supposed to be for two
years, but you got time added on for bad behaviour, You
have been looking forward to this day for some three years
now, not  least because y ou have a  small amount o f
unﬁnished business t o attend to. You were stitched up
something rotten over that Long Ditton Spaghetti caper and
a spot of revenge would not go amiss.
Dodger Geezers is an adventure in two parts. In part one,
you must ﬁnd a crime to commit and assemble a team to help
you do it. Part two involves pulling off the actual crime. The
game is set in the East End of London, presumably because
everybody knows that that is where all the real criminals
hang out, There is the usual collection of misﬁts as y o u make
your way round dark alleys, seeding pubs, a dockland area
and the dog track. Crimes are being committed all round
you, judging from the number of wanted posters about, but
can you actually ﬁnd the men required for your team? And
who is the shadowy ﬁgure with the white Gucci shoes who
turns up everywhere? And why  are there several crates
hidden in the warehouse full of two inch nails when they' are
clearly marked Banco di Palmermo? All you have to go on is
a telephone number from a colleague who was released on
the same day as you. All you want now is a working phone.
Dodgy Geezers is a reasonable enough game without
being outstanding. The parser is fairly crude, being for the
most part verb/noun input. There are a few spot graphics,
usually the wanted posters which brighten the place up but
the gangland atmosphere and jokes don't quite
work

OF l a  
N
 T  iri
rian Clough has always been known as an unusual
football manager. Now the game that carries his name is a
computer game with a big difference because it's also a
board game!
Inside a packed video size cassette box is the game tape or
disk, a folded game board, ﬁve coloured counters, 112 player
cards, immunity cards and a heap of game money and, of
course, an extensive instruction leaﬂet. As the game loads
the players just have time to set out the board, cards and
pieces and sign up as a top manager in a super league of 10
teams. Between two and ﬁve teams can he managed by
humans the rest are controlled by computer and one of four
skill levels. There's no great mystery here, the higher the skill
level the stronger the computer teams that you'll face.
In fact the whole game is remarkably simple and after
only a tew ﬁxtures you'll be wheeling and dealing with the
best of them. Indeed the hardest part of the entire game is
persuading the game board to stay ﬂat after being folded up
inside the box.
Once the game has loaded you have to choose your team
from the list available or you can overwright one if your
favourite's not included in the initial line up. After a brief

pause, the computer displays the line up for each team in
turn including two reserves. This line up consists of a series
of numbers, between one and ﬁve that represent the skill
levels o f  your goalkeeper, defenders, midﬁelders and
attackers that form your initial squad of players. You then
take the corresponding cards from the pack of playing cards
to start the game. These cards also feature names for every
player that are sure to cause rows particularly i f you're
favourite's only a  level one and not an international
standard level ﬁve. The names aren't important to the game
but vital to  football fanatics so a few blank cards are
included to correct these "mistakes".
The game plays as alternate rounds of moving the pieces
around the board and football ﬁxtures on the computer
although the computer is active throughout.
By throwing the computer dice players move their
counters around and land on squares that contain the
problems and crises that make up a manager's job. These
range from the Manager's Luck and Selection Problem
Cards that are displayed randomly on the computer screen
to the dreaded Wages that are paid out and depend on the
size and skill levels of your squad.
The Managers Luck cards are a bit of a lottery and can

selling the reserves' training ground. The same is true of the
Selection Problems cards but most are bad news and can cost
you a  crucial player fo r a  match through injury o r
suspension but the occasional one may get you a free
transfer.
The most exciting squares generate player auctions in
which the managers bid for the next card jin the player pack.
At some stages in the game bidding can get desperate as
players out bid each other particularly if a level ﬁve player is
involved. Occasionally a manager gains the advantage if he
lands on a 50% Auction square as he only has to pay half of
his ﬁnal bid!
C64 REVIEW
Before each match the players must enter their total
attack and defence strengths that are calculated from their
selection card team. A  fe w  seconds later having
contemplated these and factors such as home advantage and
league position the C64 teletype displays the results jand the
gate money that the players receive.
The season consists of only nine matches as each team
plays each other but also includes FA Cup matches featuring
giant killers such as Yeovil Town. and, from the second
season European matches, although your squad has to be
good to live with the likes of Bayern Munich and Juventus.
Throughout the game your achievements and results are
noted and are converted into game points and at the
predetermined end (a number of seasons or a time limit) the
player with most game points will be "over the moon" as he
has won the game.
One ﬁnal piece of advice is keep off the Crisis Square!
This suicide space (renamed the "sick as a parrot" square)
costs you 00,000 and your best player!
A fascinating mix of computer strategy and board game
fun that combine to form the football favourite.

Too Busy Earning a Living
To Make Any Real Money?
You think you've got problems?
Well. I remember when a hank turned me
down for a $200 kran. Now I lend money to
the bank -  Certiﬁcates of  Deposit at
5100.00(i a crack.
I remember the day a car dealer got a little
nervous because I was L couple of months
behind in my payments a n d  repossessed
my car. Now I own a Rolls Royce. I paid
$43.000 for ii - cash.
I remember the day my wife phoned me,
crying. because the landlord had shown up at
the house, demanding his rent -  and we
didn't have the money to pay it.
Now we own ﬁve homes. Two are on the
oceanfront in California (I use one as my
ofﬁce). One is  a  lakefront "cabin" in
Washington (that's where we spend the
whole summer - loaﬁng. ﬁshing. swimming,
and sailing). One is a condominium on a
sunny beach in Mexico. And one is snuggled
right on the best beach of the best island in
Hawaii - Maui.
Right now I could sell all this property, pay
off the mortgages - and - without touching
any of my other investments - walk away
with over $750.1100 in cash. But I don't want
to sell. because I don't think of my homes as
-
and stocks, bonds, and cash in the bank - for
that.
I remember when I lost my job. Because
was head over beds in debt, my lawyer told
me the only thing I could do was declare
bankruptcy. He was wrong. I paid off every
dime.
Now. I have a milhon dollar line of credit.
but I still don't have a job. Instead. I get up
every weekday morning and decide whether
I want to go to work or not. Sometimes I do -
for 5 or 6 hours, But about half the time. I
decide to read, go for a walk, sail my boat.
swim, or ride my bike.
I know what it's like to be broke. And I
know what it's like to have everything you
want_ And I know that you - like me - can
decide which one it's going to be. It's really as
easy as that. That's why I call it "The Lazy
Man's Way to Riches."
So I'm going to ask you to send me
PROOF!
Don't take my word for it. These
are excerpts f ro m articles i n
newspapers and magazines:
Time:
I le only works halt the year in his
stunning ofﬁce on California's Sunset
Beach. and even when he's there he puts
in short hours... In other words. Joe
Karbo. 4& is the prototype for... "The
Lazy Man's Way to Riches.'
Bustin Herald-American:
The book has drawn hundreds of
letters from persons who have proﬁted
by it...
Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:
An unpretentious millionaire. Joe
Karbo of  Huntingdon Harbor is a
vibrant, liv ing testimonial t o  his
intellectual. pragmatic conviction
Money Making Opportunities:
Maybe Joe Karbo has the secret.
Don't you think you owe it to yourself to
ﬁnd out what it is all about?... i  just

myself. Get the idea?
something I don't need: money. CIO to Is.
exact. Why? Because I want you to pay
attention. And I ﬁgure that if you've got t
invested, you'll look over what I send you
and decide whether to send it hack.., or keep
it. And I don't wanr you to keep it unless
you agree that it's worth at least a hundred
times what you invested.
Is the material "worth" in? No - if you
think of it iLs paper and ink. But that's not
what I 'm selling. What I  am selling is
information. More information than I give
when I'm paid S MOO as a guest speaker.
More information than I give in a one-hour
consultation for S3011.
But you're really not risking anything.
Because I won't cash your cheque or money
order for 31 days after I've sent you my
material. That's the deal. Return it in 31 days
- and s e n d  back your cheque or postal
order - uncashed.
How do you know I'll do it? Well, if you
really want to be on the safe side, postdate
your cheque for a month from today -plus 2
additional weeks. That'll give you plenty of
time to receive it, look it over, try it out.
I know what your thinking: "He got rich
telling people how to get rich." The truth is-
and this is very important - the year before I
shared "The Lazy Man's Way to Riches." my
income was $216.646. And what I'll send you
tells just how I made that kind of money...
working a few' hours a day... about 8 months
out of the year.
It doesn't require "education." I'm a high
school graduate.
It doesn't require -

It doesn't require luck." I've had more
than my share. But I'm not promising you
that you'll make as much money as I have,
And you may do better. I personally know
one man who used these principles. worked
hard, and made I
But money isn't everything.
It doesn't require "talent." Just enough
brains to know what to look for. And I'll tell
you that.
It doesn't require "youth." One woman I
worked with is over 70. She's travelled the
world over. making all the money she needs.
doing only whai I taught her.
It doesn't require "experience." A widow
in Chicago has been averaging $25 MIMI a year
for the past 5 years, using my methods.
What does it require? Belief. Enough to
take a chance. Enough to absorb what I'll
send you. Enough to put the principles into
action. If you do just that - nothing more,
nothing less - the results will be hard to
believe. Remember - I guarantee it.
You don't have to give up your job. But
you may soon be making so much money
that you'll he able to. Once again -
guarantee it.
I know you're sceptical. Well, here are
some comments from other people. (Initials
have been used t o protect the writer's
privacy. The originals arc in my ﬁles.) I'm
sure that, like you. these people didn't
believe me either when they clipped the
coupon. Guess they ﬁgured that. since I
wasn't going to deposit their cheques for al
least 31 days, they had nothing to lose.
They were right.

lel rorth a  look  since they provide a
general gathering of the big wigs of our
industry. The CES Show in Las Vegas
in January was n o  exception, and
that's where I managed to track down
Nigel Shepherd, General Manager of
Commodore N o r t h  A m e r i c a ,
ensconced i n  t h e  s plendour  o f
Commodore's stand.
The Venue
The CES Exhibition is held twice a
year in the USA. The summer show is
staged in Chicago and the winter extra-
vaganza takes place in Las Vegas. It
was to the latter venue that I wended
my way this year.
The Las Vegas show is the largest
of its kind in the world and this year's
event was no exception with a record
attendance o f  over 100,000 visitors.
The show is open only to trade visitors,
made up largely o f  representatives
from retailers, manufacturers and the
media, pouring in from the USA and
all ov er t h e  w o r ld .  Ex hibit or s

importantly from my point of view,
computer companies.
There were four venues: the Las
Vegas Hilton, the Convention Centre,
the Sahara Hotel and the Riviera
Hotel. The home computer companies
were all based in the West Hall, a huge
building which is just one o f  many
which form the Convention Centre.
Commodore was there in force and
exhibited its products from a massive
and very impressive stand. I t  was a

Expansion card and the 1351 mouse. A
number of software companies were
exhibiting from the stand including
Byte to Byte, Quantum and Anakin
Research.
The Man Himself
Nigel Shepherd, a man o f  presence,
very charming and charismatic, is the
General Manager of Commodore US
and N o r t h  Americ a. H e  reports
directly t o Tom Rattigan, President
and C h i e f  Executive O fﬁc er  o f

Nigel Shepherd is Scots by birth
and Australian by commerce and has
been involved with Commodore since
1977. I n it ia lly  a s  a n  Aus tr alian
Commodore distributor, Commodore
later set up an Australian subsiduary
and in 1979 Nigel Shepherd became
the General Manager for  the As ia
Paciﬁc Region ( all countries fr om
Australia to Hong Kong). In January
1986, he moved to the US to take over
North American responsibilities.
Tripartite Aims
Nigel Shepherd sees Commodore as
active in three sections of the computer
industry.
Firstly, he sums up the C64/I28 as
the "classic deﬁnition o f  the home
computer". His authoratative view is
that 90% of all C64/128 purchasers are
ﬁrst time buyers, also many 128 buyers
are people upgrading from a C64.
He also sees Commodore playing
an impor tant r o le  i n  t h e  lar ge
educational m a r k e t  i n  t h e  U S
particularly i n  the primary school
sector known in the States as K1 to
K12. T o  back this  u p  Nigel also
reminded m e  t h a t  i n  t h e  U S A ,
Germany a n d  Aus tralian markets
Commodore ar e leaders w it h  t h e
C64/128 in home computers. He sees
the C64/128 as a common product line
which w ill be around i n  1990 and
Commodore will continue to support
the mac hines  w i t h  per ipher als
software etc.
The m u c h  appr ais ed A m i g a
machine, only  recently launched, is
seen b y  N igel a s  t h e  futur e o f
Commodore both in  the home and
business markets.

Being Frank, Nigel commented
that: "probably  t h e  single largest
criticism aimed at the Amiga is that the
consumer is unsure whether or not the
machine is for the home or is a desk top
computer -  a  computer too highly
priced to be accepted as a home com-
puter and the lack o f  productivity
CBM's IBM clone
software makes it difﬁcult to accept it
as a business machine."
Commodore's ans wer t o  t h is
criticism is to launch three different
versions of the Amiga and attack both
home and business markets in terms of
price and quality.
Nigel explained t h a t  t h e  ﬁr s t
version, the Amiga 1000, has fantastic
user loyalty and it will be followed in
the nex t few months b y  two new
Amigas the 500 and the 2000 to expand
the product line.
Nigel ex plained t h e  t hink ing
behind this strategy. He envisages that
the C64/128 will be purchased as a
family machine by  ﬁrst time buyers
with a main use for children aged ﬁve
to 12 years old. The machine is not too
expensive but Commodore cannot be
sure that the family will continue to use
it. The answer to upgrading combined
with continued brand loyalty is the
Amiga 500 -  the low cost version,
described by the enthusiastic General
Manager a s  " t h e  ultimate h o m e
computer". O n top of  this the high
demand f or  computer learning will
2000 Amiga
I N T E R V I E W
continue and there is  s till a  great
demand for productivity software. The
buyer who has grown up with a C64 or
even a Spectrum, and is looking for a
second purchase will appreciate better
sound, graphics and top class games -
Amiga technology lends itself to this
market.
The 2000 Amiga will be a desk top or
business computer and will also be the
home o v e r la p  m a c h in e .  N i g e l
Shepherd believes that "the home is a
location". Although traditionally used
for learning and entertainment, many
small businesses are run from domestic
locations as cottage industries. The
2000 w ill lend its elf both t o  the
home/ofﬁce a n d  t r u e  bus ines s
application.
As we go to press, both the 500 and
the 2000 are scheduled for launch in
the Hanover Fair in Germany at the
end of March.
Nigel also sees the Amiga gaining
acceptance in tertiary education. He
claims that it is ideal for universities as
its price combined with its sound and
graphics capabilities are not found
elsewhere. He quickly pointed out that
the Apple Mae has neither the sound
or c olour o f  the Amiga and also
stressed that neither the Mac or the
Atari have MS DOS Capability.

Purely for Business
Commodore's third section of interest
in the computer market at the moment
is inevitably the business end due to the
Amiga's PC AT , X T  and MS DOS
compatability. Commodore has also
launched the PCIO and 20. The PC It)
was only recently launched in the US
so it ' s  s till ear ly  days f o r  these
machines.
Waxing Philosophical
Nigel Sh e p h e r d  e x p la in e d  t h e
Commodore philos ophy  i n  t h e
following terms. "Commodore w ill
continue to design and manufacture
machines that are competitive and will
enable both Commodore and retailers
to make money. We will continue to be
in the MS DOS market place. There
will always be a home market and
Commodore's original forte is serving
that market. Commodore is moving
up market to desk top publishing and
corporate t y pe machines. W e  are
committed t o  today's and to future
market places."
He added: "The difference between
today and two years ago is that now a
machine can be suitable for all of the
markets home, personal and business
- all in one box whereas before there
were t h r e e  d is t in c t  mac hines .
Commodore has one major advantage
-  the Amiga chip set."
As k ed s p e c i ﬁc a l l y  a b o u t
Commodore's U K  o u t ﬁt ,  N ig e l
replied: "Commodore North America
has been through tough times in the
last 18 months and like Commodore
UK, had to rationalise the business
and start all over again." However,
Nigel believes that the corner has now
been turned. He sees Commodore UK
consolidating and building i n  this
country. Absence of major promotion
was evident i n  t h e  pas t b u t  the
company has fought for survival and
we w i l l  n o w  see a  mu c h  mor e
aggressive approach. Nigel Shepherd
is conﬁdent that Commodore w ill
return to being a major factor in the
UK marketplace.
Your Commodore certainly hopes
so and w e'd lik e  t o  thank  Nigel
Shepherd for taking time to express his
view of Commodore North America.

On the Bali
Gremlin's Trailblazer is, by comparison, a far simpler game
in which you must bounce a ball down a track that hurtles
out of the screen at you at breakneck speed. Again staying
on the track is a major task in itself without your opponents
efforts to push you off into oblivion. Bouncing from square
to square you must plan your route along the careering
platform avoiding the traps that slow you down, reverse
your controls or send you plummeting out of the contest.
Then you're ready to gently push your opponent over the
edge to gain those crucial seconds to win the race.
Ballblazer (Activision) sets two Rotofolls in competition
with each other as they race around a bevelled pitch chasing
a steel ball. Their aim is to ﬁre the ball into one of two
moving goals.
In a timed game the foils that are controlled by either
Iprotective forceﬁelds. The outcome is decided on points with
a goal being worth more if it is scored from a distance. A fast
and furious game that's incredibly addictive to play.
The same could also be said of Odin's Hypa-Ball which
features the battle for the Super Cup between two three man
teams, the Hawks and the Vipers. Before the match you can
choose your players from the 10 man squad to be your
jetpowered strike one and two and Earthbound grounder.
After a quick appearance by the cheerleaders the players
take their positions either side of the central pole on which
the goal globe travels on its relentless path up and down
making goals even harder to get.
Thanks to a force ﬁeld network the players are trapped in
zones in between which the ball bounces and rebounds until
captured by a player. However he has only two seconds
(otherwise he concedes a penalty) to pass the ball or shoot at
goal.
After 10 gruelling minutes of play the result is reported in
the popular newspaper the Echo.

found in the Gal-corps leisure complex. Described as a

Knocking a ball into a goal is the aim of Argus Press
Software's Xeno and is a futuristic development of shove
halfpenny football. The two contestants must ﬁre their xeno
craft to intercept and knock the ball into the goal to Score in

Finally, the bizarre Bounces from Beyond deﬁes

he 64 has a full compliment o f
64K o f RAM, but the designers, in
their inﬁnite wisdom, made only about
38K available to Bask. For those able
to use machine code, the RAM behind
the ROMs is easily used but to most
others, it's forbidden fruit. There is
nice lump of 4K between the ROMs,
however, which can be used. Basic
keeps track of storage of variables in a
collection of zero page pointers. These
pointers, along with their starting
values, are listed in Table 1.

Pointer Variations
The values o f  these pointers arc
changed as program lines or variables
are added or removed. By setting these
pointers to  the RAM between the
ROMs, we can have a second variable
area, Listing 1 gives a short routine
which will do this task for you. The
routine lives in the cassette buffer so
that it doesn't pinch any memory. The
routine has three entry points:
SYS 830: This sets up the table which
saves the pointer values t o  some
default values pointing to the spare
RAM. This table is switched in when
you want to use the extra RAM and is
updated when yo u  return t o  the
normal R A M .  T h i s  command
effectively performs CLR on the extra
RAM, Since using this command when
the extra RAM is active messes things
up, it detects which RAM is in use and

required result. Using it with the extra

each time you  switch t o  normal
variables.
Listing 2 gives a simple demo to
show how the routine works. Line 10
performs CLR on the extra RAM and
switches in in. Since FRE uses the
variable pointers, you will see that it
works correctly on both sets of RAM.
The routine shows you that tw o
variables sets o f variables with the
same names can be used.
One word o f warning. You must
not perform actions which change the
pointers or use software which depend
on them when the extra RAM is in use
— always switch the normal RAM back
in ﬁrst. Such operations include
adding or deleting program lines and
using assemblers which use th e
variable pointers to assist storage.
Alternat he Process
An alternative method o f adding to
your available memory is the use of
random access on disk to  provide
virtual memory. So me  serious

programs use this approach to provide
HELP information without reducing
the memory available to  the main
program. The Listing 3 provides a
general routine which will store and
recall blocks of up to 255 bytes on disk.
To those o f you who aren't in the
know, the disk is split into 35 tracks,
each comprising o f  a  number o f
sectors. The number of sectors varies
from 17 to  21 depending o n  the
position of the track. Each sector holds
on block or 2.55 bytes.
The program uses a menu system
to provide ﬁve options. The ﬁrst
option reserves the speciﬁed sectors
and ﬁlls each with a zero byte (@).
This is because a zero byte is used as a
sentinel to indicate the end of a string.
This reservation ( o r  allocation)

operation is nulliﬁed i f you use the
validate instruction, so beware!
Option 2  saves a  string a t the
required location. Since you may want
to input string of up to 255 bytes, a
special input routine (lines 750 to 1030)
is used. All you do is type in the string
using cursor keys and DEL to edit it.
The string must end with an asterisk.
When the string is complete, press
back arrow to process it. The sectors
on the disk are numbered sequentially
so that track One holds sectors zero to
20, track two holds sectors 21 to 41 etc.
Since tracks are of variable length, the
routine from lines 1420 to 1470 is
needed t o  calculate th e  relevant
track/sector from the number of the
data block.
Option 3  loads and prints a
lioulicxxvimmarﬂE april 1987

gi D
speciﬁed data block. If you want to
extract data in your own programs,
you should reproduce lines 580 to 680,
lines 1420 to 1470. If you're a careful
programmer, you should also use the
error checking routine (lines 1070 to
1100).
Option 4 prints a map of the disk
contents. Allocated but unused sectors
are shown as "@". Those containing
data blocks are shown as "* ". The
ﬁnal option simply allows you to
format a disk.
Data saved using this program
does not appear on the directory since
it is written direct to the disk. If, in fact,
you use the track which holds the start
of the directory (track 18), and try to
load the directory, you will get an
interesting result!

emulate their green baize heroes and all from the comfort of
their own home. Classic Snooker has enough options to keep
even the most devote fan quiet during the odd hour where,
,due t o  some unfortunate error i n  t he programming
schedules, there isn't actually any of the real stuff on the box.
There are three skill levels and you can choose to play
ither against a friend or the computer. Control of the game
is simplicity itself. Position the cueball in the 'D' if necessary,
select the angle of the shot, decide what, if any, spin you want
to impart on the cueball and ﬁlially select the power
required. If you pot a red, you are prompted for a colour and
this is simply a matter of moving the cursor over your choice.
Details of the scores, current break and highest break to date
1 are displayed below the table. There is an edit mode included
in the program so you don't have to play a full game if you
don't want to or you can set up and practice all those fancy
trick shots_
The only problem with the game, and unfortunately it's a
major one, is that the balls are far too active when hit. You

expedient o f  using chemistry or  the surgeon's knife to
remove any offending part of mind or body. This in turn
produced thousands of socially useful androids who were
used to patrol the less savoury sections of the city and who
had instructions to kill on sight any escaping prisoner. Not
as you might imagine by the simple method of blowing their
brains out, but rather by hand to hand combat which at least
afforded the prisoner a ﬁghting chance, But who am I to
argue as withot such far fetched plots as these, computer
games would be so much the poorer?
As it happens, one such prisoner was trying to escape (1
bet that surprised you). You play the part of Deke in this
latest beat-cm-up from Melbourne House. In order to gain
your freedom, you must travel through six zones of the city,
hitting or avoiding the androids as you see ﬁt. The zones
include the cell block, guard area, prison wall, city, down
town and the outer wall. Available actions are run left and
right, jump and drop, punch and kick. There are ﬁve
different types of android to encounter as well as potentially
useful items hidden behind doors and oil barrels. Al this
must be done against the clock as you managed to sabotage
the prison computer causing the entire city to self destruct.
As a hint as to how much time you have got, it may be co-
incidental that Ron Hubbard's sound track lasts for 17
minutes.
And that's all there is to it. The graphics are so-so, the
gameplay dreadful. Save your money.

Major crashes result in your car exploding and game over

although it costs you time. A two page menu is presented
showing all the various bits of your car and the amount of
damage that they have accrued. Anything that is more than
80% damaged must be ﬁxed. This involves moving the

game from Swedish software house American Action. The
game that promises all of the violence and brutality you've
ever dreamed about features 10 ancient contests in which the
loser literally loses his head (thanks to a handy on podium
guillotine!)
You can select your athlete from the motley collection of
Knorr, Hawk, Nop and Dog who does battle against either a
human o r  computer opponent in  challenges where the
ancient art of joystick waggling is crucial to victory.
The contestants are tested to the full by  events that
examine their strength, accuracy and constitution in front of
a critically violent crowd.
During the contest they compete in a tug of war where
the loser ends up in a river, the tower jump where a successful
leaper must land on his head and the poleﬁght over a ravine

when the loser takes a dive!
A barbarian in stocks froms the live target for the human
hit event in which the player must hurl rocks at his nose,
arms and legs. In the axe throwing the barbarians get a
chance to throw axes at each other and in the cat throwing a
poor moggy hurtles through the air and lands dangerously
close to a hungry looking crowd.
My favourite event is the beer drinking in which our
heroes must quaff three barrels of beer without spilling a
single drop. A mixture of timing and waggling are required
to drain the barrel and deliver the victory belch before your
opponents cleared the froth. Finally, three rounds of arm
wrestling end the contest with a seagull delivering the ﬁnal
blow to the loser,
Each event is supported with "fun" graphics such as a
cross section of a barbarians head so that you can control the
ﬂow in the beer drinking and inserts of the players during the
mountain walk to counteract any loss of balance.
Overall the game is good fun to play despite it's raw
appearance and makes a welcome change from the slopes,
ﬁelds and tracks of the more serious sports simulations,

players as the computer will pick these ones. However as you
get ﬁrst pick you should soon be in with a chance,
The Hypa-Ball stadium is split into two halves by a
central pole along which the goal ball relentlessly moves up
and down at a constant rate. At either edge of the screen the
pitch is bounded by a force ﬁeld that teleports the steel
playing ball into the other half.
After a quick twirl from the cheerleaders the players take
their position. The strike ones and twos hover on either side
of the pole and arc restricted to that half of the ﬁeld, whereas
the grounder can move where he wants to as long as he keeps
his feet on the ground. The match begins as the ball is ﬁred
into play.
Joystick controls move one strike and the grounder at
any one time. This takes a while to get used to but soon you'll
be chasing ball. Once you catch it you have to think quickly
as you've only got 2.5 seconds to get rid of it otherwise you'll
concede a penalty and a certain goal.
Goals are scored by ﬁring the ball at the goal but since it's
a moving target this isn't easy. In a 10 minute match against
a good computer opponent your concentration must be total
as the slightest lapse will let him in to score.
A fast and furious, futuristic sports game supported by
super sounds and speedy gameplay.

ROBOT RASCALS
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
R
Electronic Arts (through Ariolasoft) and is a game that's
half computer game and half card game!
Basically, the game is a multi-player treasure hunt with a
hand of cards deciding what the players arc looking for.
Four cards are dealt as the program is loaded in. Then the
players select one of the 10 robots that would each be at
home in Electronic Art's classic game M.U.LE. Although
they are visibly different, there doesn't seem to be any
difference in their strengths or abilities.
Each turn, each players gets to move his robot around
the alien world of Laustenfownd seeking out their selected
artefacts. Moving through rocks or trees costs more energy
than strolling through the plains. Either way this energy is
deducted from the robots turn allocation. When all the
energy has gone the turn is over. As well as moving a robot
can scan for one of the 24 items that range from a denim disk
to a digital donut, The robot then spins around (the quicker
the spin the closer you are to the object) and ﬁnally points in
the direction you need to go in. Collect all four objects and
return home (in the centre of Laustanfawnd) and you've won
the game.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple as the other plavers are
out to stop you. There's another pack of cards, the luck
cards, that can force you to show your hand to the others,
allow you to swap one Of your cards for somebody else's or
get everyone to swap with the descriptive "pass the trash

cards (and the objects they represent) are better than others
such as the Super Shield and Velocity Vitamin that add to
your robot's powers whereas the Energy Eater and Action
Anchor slow you down. There's even a killer card that stops
you from winning unless you can pass it on to someone else.
This card gets passed around a lot,
The mischief doesn't end with cards as you can also get
your robot to go and mug the other players by ramming
them and the stealing what you want but you can also use
energy to build shields to protect yourself from muggers.
Finally just as you thought you had things under control
the game alters one of its global factors such as slowing down
all movement or increasing the energy and scuppers your
plans.
A fun game for all the family that is best played with the
maximum four players to allow maximum scullduggery.
Believe me this can get vicious as people have been known to
drop objects that I've wanted at the bottom of lakes just to
postpone my victory celebrations but don't worry I'll get
revenge.

scenario giving you the chance to put the wrongs of the
Universe to right. This time, the object of your mission is
revenge as you attempt to wipe out an alien force that has
seized a Terran-settled system on the edge of the galaxy. Yes
folks! It's another shoot-cm-up.
Why is it that whenever there is any sort of trouble, you
arc the only person around capable of sorting it out? This
time, the 'trouble' comes in the form of a few thousand alien
GAMES R EVIEWS

ships and ground defences spread over such divergent land-
scapes as jungles, asteroid belts and ice-planets.
Despite the unoriginal storyline, Lightforce plays very
well indeed. The graphics, while not quite as stunning as the
Spectrum version, are still noteworthy. The game itself is
basically one of learning the patterns of the airborne aliens
whilst a t the same time, manoeuvring yourself into a
position whereby you can blast the ground targets. Your
task is made more tricky as these need several hits to destroy
them. They are vital though. Take out four control centres
and you earn yourself a most welcome extra life. Apart from
your twin lasers, there are other special weapons to be found
and activated as you continue your aerial Rambo act.
Faster Than Light, the company producing Lightforce
has managed the one ingredient that makes shoot-em-ups
stand out from the crowd. The game is incredibly addictive.
Couple that with the on screen effects and Lightforce
becomes an essential purchase for anyone who enjoys a fast
blast,

Xeno
D
in the 23rd century, Xeno was originally a game with few
rules and considerable violence. The basic idea was a fairly
traditional one — try to hit a puck into your opponent's goal
more times than he managed to do the same to you. If the
puck or you happened to hit the opponent, tough luck!
In today's sanitised version, the game has become a huge
spectator sport, the rules have been tidied up somewhat and
champions become legends overnight. Xeno is your chance
to become one of the sporting heroes of the galaxy.
The game is a sort of space age ice hockey. Each player
controls a disk and takes it in turn to ﬁre it anywhere on the
lozenge shaped rink, the ultimate objective being to knock
the puck into your opponent's goal. You can try and hit the

puck direct, knock your opponent's disk out of the way or
try to block his shot. The game is played over four quarters
and the person with the highest score is the winner.
Playing Xeno is simplicity itself — you simply move a
small arrow around the pitch, press ﬁre and your disk travels
in the appropriae direction. The games can effectively
become user deﬁned as there are a number of variables that
you can ﬁddle with: one or two players, the length of each
quarter, the amount o f time between shots and a handi-
capping system for the computer. In practice, the default
values work as well as any others and lead to a fast and
furious game although not one in which you will be beaten
out of sight by the computer.
Xeno is a well implemented, simple game that is great fun
to play.

THE DOUBLE
E
'double', by winning both the league and FA Cup in one
season. This achievement has only been done ﬁve times in
the history of English football but here you can try and make
it six with this new football simulation game from
Scanatrow
Being a football nut myself I can honestly say that this is
by far the most realistic game of its kind I have come across.
All the usual gameplay features are included with this type of
game, but this particular one has many better features then
its rivals.
Included among the options are ones that allow you to
employ scouts to report on any team or player from any
division and a physiotherapist to help nurse your injured
players. As well as coping with the teams problems you are
asked to deal with the running of ground improvements,
sackings, wages and even estimating your attendance.
Underestimating the crowd can result in terrace battles
GAMES R EVIEWS
CHAMELEON
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
whilst over estimating can result in huge policing bills and
lecture from your chairman.
Except for cup matches, watching games is optional
if your side is having a particularly poor spell then you ma)
wish to watch another game from another division. The
simulations are rather lengthy and take about 15 minutes it
all but commentary of the game helps identify the quality 01
your players.
After each game you are given the scores, scorers and
attendance ﬁgures for all matches. The attendance ﬁgures
and playing squads were selected from the 1985-86 seasoli
and add a very up to date dimension to the game.
Overall 'The Double' is an exceptionally realistic game
and an absolute must for any football fan but it is at times
rather slow and time consuming.

Earth, Air and Water and do battle with the demons that
now rule there. These demons were created by an evil man to
master the powers of nature and so wreak havoc on to the
Earth with freak storms, blizzards and dust storms.
Using your ﬂux you can match the demons and defeat
them in combat while repairing the damage caused by the
tainted ﬂux.
During your quest you must journey through these
strange realms and seek out the tainted ﬂux that can be
found only in a certain place and a speciﬁc time of day.
Luckily, you are ﬁtted with warning buzzes that sound when
you meet one of the criteria, then it's merely a matter of

Your mission is to search the strange platforms and
portals of the Heartland for the missing pages so that the
story (and Heartland) has a happny ending. However Midan
knows of your presence and has sent his minions to get you.
These consist of the spitting wizards and the indestructable
gooches that chase you even after you've blasted them into a
pile of bones.
Your mission is further hampered by the energy draining
stars and bubbles that ﬂoat above the platforms and six dark
pages that detail a different end to the book involving lots of
GBH for you and the Heartland.
Help is at hand in the more powerful weapons that you
can ﬁnd such as swords and ﬁreballs as well as other stars
that give you temporary immunity and a bed that transports
you from one scene to another. Despite this the hand of
Midan isn't far away and gets even closer every time one of

his minions or spells touch you until his face appears at the
top of the screen ending your game.
Heartland is an excellent arcade adventure featuring
some exceptional graphics particularly of the crumbling
minions as they disperse into a pile of bones. T . I I .

galaxy and at last the governments had found a drug to
control him.
This was the result of years of research and countless
failures as previous drugs had left guinea pigs in a brainless
daze. Then on a single planet called Niabmoloc they actually
found it growing on trees. Seventy per cent of the planets
trees had fruit containing the drug Sky.
Fleets o f Sky Runners riding their Sky Bikes were
despatched to harvest the drug protected by the laser ﬁring
towers that were built to protect them.
Although necessary (normal policing methods didn't
work) control drugs were still illegal. You are part of the
Runner Squad that was formed to sabotage the Sky running
on the forested world.
As you're paid by results you set off to trash as many
bikers as possible. The game begins as your skimmer lands
on the planet.
Your ﬁrst problem is to take out the laser towers that
protect the Sky collecting bikers. With your single skimmer
you must out gun the towers by blasting them in high speed
attack runs. Only then can you land and drop your ﬁrst of
three bikes.
Charging through the trees (that are as deadly as the
towers if you crash into them) you must track down and

destroy the Sky Bikers but you must take care not to destroy
your fellow runner squad men.
Unfortunately, even the eight different threat or skill
levels do nothing to  save a  game that is bland and
reminiscent of a four year old Spectrum game!

conservation reprogrammed the Sentinels. Unfortunately,
they also let in the Star Glider shaped Ergon attack ﬂeet that
devastated the defenceless planet. Luckily, you were on a
nearby moon and have found an ancient airbourne ground
attack vehicle (AGAV) and have gone to the rescue.
There's no great strategic aim to be fulﬁlled as your job is
simply to destroy all you can before they ﬁnally get you. Yot
ﬁnd you can use the planet's refuel, rearm and repair
facilities that should improve your chances.
Using a combination of keyboard and joystick controls
you must ﬂy your AGAV and do battle with a collection of
alien craft that include the Star Wars inspired walkers and
stompers, tanks, mines, missile launchers and he ﬂapping
Star Gliders. Most take more than one shot to kill and some
such as the stompers can only be destroyed by ﬁring a missile
that you must guide to the target through a separate display.
An excellent game that has been ruined b y poor

lOth FRAME
en pin bowling is the name of the game in this latest
sports simulation from the Access/US Gold stable. 10th
Frame allows up to eight players to have a go at knocking
over as many skittles as possible on either a league or one off I
basis.
For the uninitiated, ten pin bowling involves rolling a
huge ball down an alley as you attempt to knock over 10
skittles. You get two attempts to do this. If you succeed in
knocking them all down with only one ball, this is known as
a strike. Take two balls and it becomes a spare. The secret of
a high score is to make sure of getting your spares.
In order to launch a ball, you must ﬁrst select an aiming
point and position your man on the lane. Keeping the ﬁre
button pressed will start a bar moving up a scale as you
determine the speed of your release. Two small markers
determine the safe upper and lower limits for an accurate
throw. The bar then slides quickly down the right hand side
of the scale and you must press again to stop on one of the
three markers - straight, slight hook and maximum hook.
Miss your press and your ball is likely to make an early roll
into the nearest gutter.
Graphically, the game is a little disappointing. The
effects of the skittles falling down is well done but the lane is
small - one ﬁfth the width of the screen. The worst part is the
sliding scale. Yellow on orange proved very hard to see,
especially under artiﬁcial light.
10t1, Frame is a highly accurate simulation o f 10 pin
bowling but lacks a little in addictive qualities, G . R . H .

pub card games in this country. but
have you ever considered trying to beat
your computer instead o f  battling
against the champ down at your local?
Now's your chance. i f  you've got a
PI us/4.
M
It is  assumed that the player knows
how t o play cribbage. The rules are
exactly those given in Ho_yle's Rides of
Games. Since some aspects of scoring
points very from region to region, the
points scored in this version will be re-
iterated i n  t h is  introduction, T he
following points should thus be noted.
1) Due to the layout of the cards X is
used to represent a 10.
2) Input is  handled by  means o f  a
joystick in port two. When asked to
play or discard a card, simply move
the marker which appears above the
cards to the required position and
press the lire button. When entering
your points,moving the joystick
<  right a n d  <  left inc reas es
and decreases the points counter
respectively. Once' again pressing
ﬁre enters y o u r  response. T h e
program i s  protec ted agains t
attempts to discard or play the same
card twice. Attempts to claim too
many points  produce a n  er r or
message. The Plus/4 always claims
the correct number of  points for
itself but, if you don't claim all your
points, the Plus/4 will steal them.
P L U S / 4
Cribbage
I f  you've ever played cribbage then you'll knotv just
,
what an addictive game it is and if you haven't then try
our Plus/4 version of the game
By Hugh McGhee
3) Each player is dealt six cards and
must discard two cards into the
crib. T he Plus /4 plays a  simple
strategy choosing its best four cards
after consideration of the two cards
it i s  discarding. T h e  cards are
shufﬂed after every hand but only
cards are shufﬂed out of the pack to
save time. The program differen-
tiates between dealer and non-
dealer. The player who doesn't have
the crib always receives the ﬁrst
card.
4) The Plus/4 cuts the cards for the
initial crib. The lowest card wins.
Note that i n  this  game the ace
always c ounts  a s  one.  Illegal
combinations are not allowed so
two aces of spades, for example, will
not be displayed. Ties however,
such as both players cutting a two of
different suits, are permitted, in
which case the cut will be performed
again.
5) The ﬁrst player to obtain 121 points
or more wins.
6) Note that in the run up the Plus/4
will check your cards if you say you
can't go. This is the only time the
Plus/4 examines your cards but it
does not cheat. Any discovery of an
ability to play after entering 'can't
go* will produce an error message,
as will an attempt to playa card that
would result in a total excess of 31.
The Plus/4 does not play a strategy
in the run up except that it  will
always make the total 31 if it can. It
will not, however, always make the
total IS even if it can.
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
4(1
7) The ending of a go in the run up has
proved the most tricky operation in
practice. If the player plays last the
Pitts/4 does not know that t he player
cannot go unless the total is 31 or
the las t c ar d has  been played.
Otherwise the player must enter
'can't go' before entering the last
point.
Points are scored as follows:
A) T w o  points f o r  any pairs, six
points for three cards of a kind and 12
points for four cards of a kind.
B) T w o  points for any combination
of cards totalling 15, counting picture
cards as 10.
C) F o r  any r un o f  three or  more
cards, count one point for each card in
the run.
D) F o r  obtaining a total of 15 or 31
in the run up. score two points.
E) F o r  playing the last card in any go
in the run up, score one point.
F) F o r  a ﬂush of four cards in your
hand. score four points. Note there are
no points for a ﬂush or four in the crib.
(1) F o r  a ﬂush of ﬁve, either in your
hand or in the crib, score ﬁve points.
H) I f  the starter card is a jack, and it
is y our crib, add tw o points when
counting your hand in the main game.
I) I f  you have a jack either in your
hand or in the crib of' the same suit as
the starter card, count one point.
S) The game is played on the high
resolution screen t o facilitate the
different background colours.

elements in rows zero, two and four
hold the denominations of the four
cards in the Plus/4's hand, player's
hand and the crib respectively. The
associated suits are stored in the ﬁrst
four elements of rows one, three and
live. At the commencement o f the
main game the ﬁfth element of each
relevant row will be occupied by the
denomination and suit of the starter
card. which is used by all hand.
The face values for the deck o f
cards are stored in the array P%(m,n)
row zero holding the values one (for
P L U S / 4
The major scalar variables are as follows:
Plus/4's points
P— P l a y e r ' s  points
TP— U s e d  in run up to indicate number of cards played in the current go.
Used in total the points in the points count routine. Also used in
the run up to hold the total face values in the current go.
PO— U s e d  in the main game to hold the total points count being the sum
of T above and the result of checks for ﬂushes, jacks etc. Also used
to hold points scored in the run up as T is otherwise engaged.
ML— F l a g  used to indicate who played the current card in the run up. If
ML is one then the PLus/4 played last, and if ML equals two the
player did.
IC— F l a g  used in the run up to indicate whether or not the Plus/4 can
play a card. The Plus/4 is able to play a card whilst IC is equal to
one and unable to go if equal to zero.
YC— S e r v e s  the same purpose as IC for the player.
MG, YG— These two variables hold the number of cards played in the run up
by the Plus/4 and the player respectively.
WC— S i g n i ﬁe s  who holds the crib. If set to one then the Plus/4 has the
crib and if set to two the player has the crib.
the ace) to 13 (for the king), whereas
row one holds the values one to 10 (for
the purpose of counting I5s).
The respective values o f  the
shufﬂed cards are placed in the array
Sck(m,n) after shufﬂing, The values
are transfered t o  C%(m.n) after
dealing the cards and are ﬁnally stored
in the VcTh(m,n) array after the discard.
The arrays Suk(m,n) and V%(m,n)
have exactly the same format as the
SS(m,n) and FS(m,n) arrays described
above.
The array R70(m,n) is used by the
sorting routine for run checks. The
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
41
unsorted cards are placed in row one
and after transfer b y  the sorting
routine into row zero. That row is
sorted into ascending order.
The arrays M%(11) and Y70(m) are
row vectors each containing four
elements. These arrays are used in the
run u p , and, a  non-zero element
indicates a played card. As is general in
this program, any variable preﬁxed by
the letter h4 indicates a value used by
the Pl u s/4 , whereas variables
associated with the player are preﬁxed
with a Y.

H
useful utility or program routine, given
it to a 'friend' only to discover at a later
time that somebody else has 'gone in'
and taken the credits. Annoying isn't
it!
Also thereatva certain number of
users that take delight in corrupting
software by changingthetextroutines
etc.
This program routine provides the
user with the facility to scramble code
thus making the would be hacker's job
that much mor e difﬁc ult a s  t h e
scrambled code disguises any text.
Getting it in
Make sure that sufﬁcient room exists
on the disk prior t o  'booting' u p
'PRG.SCRAMBLER'; occasionally
one extra disk block is used on the
saved ﬁle, Press any  k ey  o n  the
keyboard to enter the scrambler code,
enter the ﬁlename of the program to be
scrambled and press RETURN to start
the sequence.
The program i s  then loaded,
scrambler and saved back to disk as
'-FILENAME' where ﬁlename is the
name of the program.
The routine adds 70 bytes to the
saved code so the only limitation on
this routine i s  t h a t  t h e  or iginal
program must exist between $080 I and
$CF8F. Even if  202 blocks are used
there still may be sufﬁcient room on
C64 P R O G R A M ' .

Diskit
To continue our special series l'or disk users, we bring
you a routine which will foil those would be hackers
from stealing your thunder.
By Les Allan
the disk. As I am sure you are aware.
each block is allocated 256 bytes but all
may not be used.
Once the save process is completed
the program exists in memory as the
ﬁnished product and can be conﬁrmed
as successful by entering RUN.
The program must be typed in
exactly as listed and saved prior to
running. E r r o r  t r a p  routines a r e
included to ensure that the data as read
is correct. The program, when run,
stores the relevant code at a temporary
address o f  $800 and when prompted
relocates the working program to Basic
($0801) and saves the program to disk.

DIAMOND MINE
D
get to grips with at the start, but for some reason you have to
keep having 'just one more go'.
The idea is to guide your pipe through the mine to reach
the diamonds. You have to avoid contact with the walls and
bugs, otherwise you lose that much pipe and you have to
start all over again. On each level. the length of pipe you have
to start with gets less and less, this is shown at the top left of
the screen.
Movement of the pipe is one of those infuriating types
of control. Once y ou start t o  move, you cannot stop.
Therefore you not only have to be accurate, you must also
have quick reﬂexes.
Although this looks a very simple game, there is quite a
lot o f  hidden strategy involved in actual play. Pick the
shortest route to a diamond, not the easiest, for example.

for the C16/Plus/4 for some time, with Magicians Curse,
'Long ago, this land was inhabited by an evil magician.
The land is now uninhabited etc.', so the inlay informs you.
It's surprising how many evil magicians used to exist.
The prime object is to search this land of 48 screens and
secure for yourself a golden statue. Before you achieve this
goal however, you must also collect seven talismans. These
can be found in various places just lying around.
Whilst you are busy running from screen to screen, your
energy is quite understandably getting less and less. To
counteract this, you need to either drink some potion, or eat
some food. A couple of the locations will need a key to gain
entry, whilst the underground caverns will need some light
source to navigate.
Naturally, it is not quite this simple. There are the odd
vampire bats lurking around, and falling apples to dodge. Be

invested all your new found wealth into opening an even
bigger mine. Diamond Mine I I  is  virtually the as its
predecessor except that there are a couple of variations.
In this version you have an assistant that keep your
winch motor going. This time you can suck the nasties up
into your pipe, however after a time they will re-appear, so
watch out.
If you try to cross over your path, or go back the same
way, a life is lost. You can however retract your pipe by
pressing the return key. This feature of the game makes it a
lot better to play than the original. You now have the ability
to plan your tactics a lot better, After the 10th level the
screens become 'invisible', making your taks that much
harder.

PINPOINT
F
Pinpoint will hold no mystery. The concept is the same. You
have to reach the white ﬂag with your spinning top. Having
achieved this, you go on to the next level.
Anco has here produced a game that should be very
popular. I  say should be, but i have my reservations. The
main problem, is that the game is just too difﬁcult to play
and enjoy fully. Control of the top is via the joystick, and you
need to be very precise in your movements.
There are the usual steep slopes to climb, and chasms to
leap. The downward slopes need to be tackled very slowly
otherwise you lose your top off the edge. Understandably,
sound is somewhat lacking, and I fear you will soon tire of
the 'dit. dits' everytime you lose a top.
The inlay card informs you that there are 10 levels of
difﬁculty, but I must confess to only reaching the fourth one
before abondoning the play. The graphics are fairly good,
being the two colour variety.
Lovers of Marble Madness and Spindizzy will obviously
love this one, as for the rest of you. I have doubts.

but I don't think that Spiky Harold will be one of them. It's
a nice enough game, but I think it lacks that inexplainable
quality of 'moreishness'.
The idea is that you have to help Harold collect as much
grub as possible. to help him hibernate for the winter. The
grub i n  question consists mainly  o f  apples, grapes,
pineapples, (What no nuts?) and wine. (Beware: not too
much).

You have to visit various caverns to collect the said grub.
each is ﬁlled with nasties of varying types. All the nasties
have one thing in common, that is, they kill you on contact.
This isn't too big a problem seeing as you start off with 19
lives.
The animation of the nasties is done very well. My only
gripe is the 'Character Detect' routine. It takes some time
before you can really judge safe distances.
In your wanderings you will, from time to time, come
across a coin. Picking this up will give you one extra life. Just
one point, the weatherman has predicted a severe frost in the
next 24 hours. This would obviously kill our Harold, so you
must succeed in your task before the time runs out.
Spiky Harold. is basically a platform game, which we
either love or hate. Overall not a bad attempt.

idea of blasting anything that moves. It must be an inbuilt
desire that humans suffer from. Dangerzone lets you do just
that.
As test pilot for the XT/99 Fighter come reconnaisance
ship, you have to blast your way through 20 levels of asteroid
belts. The higher the level, the faster they come at you. There
are also the odd wave of alien craft to beat as well, so you
need to keep your mind on your ﬂying or else.
The scrolling is deﬁnitely smooth, and on the higher
levels fast as well. My only real criticism, is that you can only
move in one of two directions (up or down).
Your ship is equipped with rapid ﬁre lasers. However
constant use of this facility soon depletes your weaponary,
so use this with caution.
Flying without ﬁring will increase your ﬁre-power but

here are occasions when i t  is
desirable t o  convert a  section o f
memory from machine code to a Basic
program containing a re-boot and set
of data instructions that represent the
original machine's memory.
This program provides the user
with the facility to 'read' sections of
machine memory to do just that! In
fact the Basic loader for this program
was produced from the very same
routine.
Start and end addresses are entered to
control the range o f  memory to be
converted. These are POKEd into the
machine code routine resident a t
SC000 which re-locates t h e  Basic
loader and performs the operation of
'reading* each byte to provide two digit
hex number in the data statement e.g.
This process is repeated for every
byte within the range as previously
speciﬁed. The completed data listing is
then saved t o  disk as D A T A  and
should be re-loaded prior to running to
establish start of variables which begin
at the end of the Basic loader.
The SYS address contained in the
Basic loader is the warm start address
and should b e  modiﬁed t o  that
required by the nature of the area of
memory being converted.
The program must be typed in
exactly as listed and saved prior to
running. Er r o r  t r a p  routines a r e
included to ensure that the data as read
is correct. The program, when run,
stores the relevant code at a temporary
address of 88000 and when prompted
relocates the work ing program t o
Basic (80801) and saves to the program
to disk,

Disk users take heart. Here we provide a handy disk
routine to convert memory to data statements.

program recently, after t he initial
paperwork I  thought i t  might be
constructive to do a 'rough sketch' out
in Basic. Slow it might be, but it's a
good way to ﬂush out a few errors in
Eogic a n d  structure. whic h might
otherwise only  b e  uncovered after
hours wasted producing redundant
code.
I immediately ran into a problem. I
intended t o  us e mor e than eight
hardware sprites in the program. and
of course it is quite impossible to write
a raster-interrupt routine in Basic. For
the sake o f  thoroughness. 1 s hall
explain the nature of raster interrupts
for the uninitiated.
The image on 'our monitor screen
is drawn by an electron beam scanning
across t h e  screen i n  a  series o f
horizontal lines, each line starling just
below the previous one. This pattern of
lines is called a raster.
Now as we all know, the VIC chip
in a 64 supports eight hardware sprites.
However, if you put your sprites at the
top of the screen, and then use a raster
interrupt to ﬁnd out when the raster
has travelled far  enough down the
screen to have drawn these sprites. you

Many programmers ,ﬁnd that sprite manipulation can be
hard work. Perhaps this program will make things a
little easier.
By S.I. Chance
can then reposition them further down
the screen so that when the raster gets
to their new location, it draws them all
over again. And when you reposition
the sprites you can also change their
colour and deﬁnition.
decided to write a routine which
would make raster-interrupt sprites
available from Basic. This was quite
easy to do, but created a new problem.
I had settled on a screen format of ﬁve
tones, (see Fig, I) which meant that my
routine was being called 250 times per
second. With all that going on. Basic
was running at about 1/4 of its normal
speed. With potentially 40 sprites to
manipulate in  addition t o  whatever
else it was doing, it became clear that
Basic would need helping out.
I extended Basic with a set of extra
commands t o  set sprite parameters
and move them around. Although this
slowed dow n t h e  interpreter even
more, the new commands were more
efﬁcient and therefore resulted in a net
increase in speed. These commands are
listed in Figure 2. and I will say more
about them later.
Returning to Figure I. you will see
that it shows the screen divided into
zones 0 to 4, and link spaces 0 to 3. The

where zone=0 to 4 and sprite=0 to 7.
From now on 1 shall refer to a speciﬁc
sprite by these parameters e.g. sprite
3,6 is sprite number 6 in zone 3.
Having said th a t, th e  Basic
extension supports a far easicr way of
specifying a  sprite. Consider th e
command 5;YPO in Figure 2. When
positioning a  sp ri te  w i th  th i s
command, it is important that the y co-
ordinate falls within the speciﬁed zone.
This is easy enough to do using Figure
but there is an alternative syntax.
This is to  assign an integer array
element to the sprite, replacing [zone],
[sprite] in the syntax. For instance,
suppose I give the command
iYPO 2,6,130
positioning sprite 6 in zone 2 at y=130.
This is correct as y=130 falls within
zone 2. However, i f  I  give the
command
iYPO C%(6),130
the sprite will be positioned exactly as
before, and the correct zone number
will be written into C70(6). i.e. C%(6)
will now equal .2.
LYPO C%(6),150
will move the sprite into link space 2,
so it will automatically by 'linked' to
sprite 3.6 i.e. its parameters will be

Moving Sprites
A command which takes this idea even
further i s  EMO V. T his  command
moves a sprite by hooking it on to what
I call an Interject' routine, which is
like an interrupt routine, but more
polite, as it waits for Basic to ﬁnish its
present command before taking over;
a sort of multi-tasking.
EMO C%(7),-2,4, 0,CX%(7 ),CY%:(7)
will move sprite C%(7) from (x,y) to
(x-2,y+4) 10 times, each time storing
the new co-ordinates in CX%(7),CY!
(7). T he frequency o f  these moves
against the speed of Basic is controlled
by the EP [pace] command where pace
can have any value between zero and
200. Again, the relevant arrays must be
declared before the command is used.
Up to 20 sprites may be EMOVed at
any one time.
Other c ommands  w h ic h  pass
values t o  a n array are EACT and
EH IT.
The Demo
Listed w i t h  t h e  S P L I T  SPRITE
LOADER is a demonstration program
using many of the new commands. It is
probably most constructive to RUN
this while following the listing, which I
have tried to make as clear as possible.
The program waits between the main
sections so you can work out what is
going on.
Before loading the demo program,
make sure you have run the one line

When running the demonstration
program, please note the last section
which uses the t El IT command t o
detect collisions. As the sprites move
back and forth, every so often they
monstrate a weakness in the system,
hen a perfectly good collision is not
gistered. This is because it takes a
ﬁnite time to transfer all the data to
and from the VIC registers at each
interrupt, and as a result it sometimes
happens that VIC  is looking in the
wrong direction when the collision
occurs. In fact there are some dead
spots in mid lin k  space' where no
collisions are registered at all. I f  this
proves critical, it often helps to use a
different sprite number, or  engineer
the collision to occur at a different
point. Alternatively, a more reliable
system is to check for  collision by
comparing t h e  a r r a y  elements
containing the sprite co-ordinates.
When writing a  program using
SPLIT SPRITE, it  is  important t o
remember that changing a  line o f
Basic, or re-RUNning the program
clears all the variables. If there is still a
sprite hooked onto the MOV routine.
when y ou nex t enter  a n y  Bas ic
command, the MO V routine will be
called and will be unable to locate the
relevant arrays. This will give an error
message. which does not really matter,
but the way to avoid it is to execute ..1:R
beforehand,
SPLIT SPRITE itself is presented
here as a Basic Loader. When POK Ed
into memory, the program resides at
SC000 — SCD07. Life will obviously
move faster if, once loaded, you save
this block of memory for future use,
with a machine code monitor.
The program uses the rest of the
SC-block along with $02B6 — SO2DD
to store variables, and is initialised by
SYS 49152.
A ﬁnal thought: if you do write a
masterpiece with SPLIT SPRITE and
intend to save it to tape, make sure you
EQuit the program ﬁrst to avoid timing

P
need not be the difﬁcult chore that
many people believe it to be. All that is
required is a good strong idea as to the
basis o f  t h e  g a m e  a n d  a n
understanding o f  h o w  a l l  o f  the
different parts are going to work.
In order to produce a quality game
then it should of course be written in
machine code. It is a lot harder to write
a program in machine code than Basic,
however, t h e  increased speed o f
execution i s  essential t o  a  good
program.
It is outside the scope of this series
to actually teach you about machine
code. Should y ou be interested i n
learning then you could take a look at
a series Welcome to the Machine that
started in the March '86 issue of Your
Commodore and ﬁnished in December,
'86.
I am aware that many people will
not be ready to tackle the rigours of
machine code just yet. Don't let this
put you off. Many good programs are
written as  a  mixture o f  Basic and
machine code.
During t h is  series I  w i l l  b e
presenting a series of small programs
that you can use yourselves, either as
part of a larger machine code program
or simply called from within your own
Basic program.
The series will be concentrating on
programming with the CM, if you are
a CI6 or Plus/4 owner don't worry,
whenever possible I  w i l l  prov ide
programs that w ill wor k  o n  these
machines.

What's to Come
So what will we be looking at? For a
start I will be discussing the use of User
Deﬁned characters w it h in  y o u r
programs, how to use them and move
them. Sprites will be dealt with in
detail complete w i t h  routines  t o
animate them and move them around
your s c reen. M a n y  games  u s e
backgrounds that are larger than the
screen. The screen acts as a window
over the larger playing area. I will he
explaining how this is done and again
provide routines to do this in your own
programs.
A n u m b e r  o f  miscellaneous
routines will also be provided for your
use. These will include routines t o
scroll messages on the screen, print
and inc r ement scores, character
editors, music programs and many
more.
Presentation
Most o f  t h e  programs t h a t  ar e
presented i n  this  series w ill be in
machine code. I will be giving both the
source code for  the program and a
Basic loader for  those o f  you who
don't want to tackle the assembler.
The assembly language programs
have b e e n  pr oduc ed u s in g  t h e
Commodore Macro Assembler. I have
tried to keep the assembly language as
simple as possible so should you use a
different assembler you should be able
to enter the programs with very few
changes.
Starting Out
In this month's article I am afraid that
I am going to make you jump straight
in a t  the deep end and deal with
something that is extremely important

e coming months I  will be
ack t o  simpler subjects,
many examples that I will be
ill require a  knowledge o f
s and use the IRQ program
going to give this month.
Interrupt
So. just what is this thing that is so
important to games writing? Well it's
really as simple as its name suggests it
is an interruption o f  whatever the
computer is doing. Let me illustrate
what I mean with a simple everyday
example.
Let's suppose that you are having a
conversation with someone and the
telephone rings and interrupts your
conversation. Y o u  l e a ve  t h e
conversation and go and answer the
telephone. If the call is for you then
you would now hold a conversation
with the person on the other end of the
telephone. When you had ﬁnished you
would put the telephone down and go
back to and continue your original
conversa tion.
What has happened is that the
ringing of the telephone simply inter-
rupts and paused yo u r original
conversation for a short while and you
carried on where you left off upon
returning
So what about interrupts i n
program ming?
Let's take a look at a practical
example. I f  you were to  write a
program that required you to move a
sprite across the screen you may write
a routine that went along the following
lines:
1. This is the main program.
2. The ma i n  program becomes
interrupted by the routine that moves
the sprite.
3. The sprite is moved by the routine.
4. Once the sprite has been moved we
go back to step (1) and continue where
we left off.
This is of course an over simpliﬁ-
cation but should give you an idea of
what an interrupt can do.
FIGURE 2
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987

Believe it or not your computer is
actually being interrupted every
I/50th of a second by the computer's
hardware. Everytime a n  interrupt
occurs the computer takes a look at a
memory location w h i ch  h o l d s
information about where the interrupt
program is stored. These couple o f
memory locations are referred to as the
interrupt vector. I n  normal use
whenever a n  interrupt occurs t he
interrupt vector holds the address of
the general routines which look after
the general running of the computer.
These routines are items such a s
scanning the keyboard to see if a key
has been pressed etc.
The interrupt vector is stored at the
following memory locations:
788 and 789
These locations are the same on all
t e
So how do you use this in your own
programs?
In Practice
Let's take a  look a t  a  practical
example. Figure I gives a Basic loader
for a machine code program that uses
interrupts. Note there are two versions
of the program one for the C64 and
one for the Plus/4 and C16.

FIGURE 3
When you run this program i t
simply POKEs a short machine code
routine into memory. To  start this
machine code routine simply type the
SYS instruction which is printed by the
program.
What this program does i s to
change the border colour every timean
interrupt occurs. Because interrupts
occur extremely quickly the ﬂash rate
is so high that the different colours
appear as a number of ﬂashing bands.
You may notice that the border is
still ﬂashing even though the computer
has returned to the READY prompt.
You can list any program that is in

memory or even type in a new program
and the border will continue to ﬂash.
This is because, as I stated earlier, the
computer is always being interrupted
every I/50th of a second and our little
screen ﬂash routine is run every time
an interrupt occurs.
The Machine Code
So let's have a look at our machine
code program and have a look at what
it does. Figure 2 gives the source code
for the C64 version of the border ﬂash
routine. The CI6 version is almost
identical apart from the locations that

The program is actually in tve WWI
ctio l e l
actually alters the IRQ vector so that i dell(
holds the location of our border ﬂasli On I
routine, section tw o  o f  our little
demonstration.
Taking the program line by line t
this is what it does:
I. We turn off the interrupts with t
SEI instruction. Th e  reason
turning them off is quite simple. N'y
are going to change the vector that
jumped to when an interrupt occur
Since interrupts occur every I/50th
a second, i f we didn't switch off th
interrupts then i t is possible that a
interrupt would occur before we had
changed both memory locations. k
this was the case then the computer
would not jump to our routine but
rather t o  some other  location in
memory a n d  t h e  computer would
probably crash.
2. After turning off the interruptss we.
alter the IRQ vector so that it points to
our border ﬂash routine.
3. Now we turn the interrupts back
Of course the interrupt vector i
changed u n ti l  y o u  execute this
program with a SYS instruction.
Our bor der  ﬂas h pr ogr am is
extremely simple, all it does is to load
the X register with the number O. This
is then stored in  the border colour
location. The X  register now has I
subtracted from it. Note in machine
code i f  you substract a  I  f r om a
memory location that contains a 0 it
will become 255. The program then
loops around until the counter gets
back t o  zero when it  jumps to the
normal interrupt routines — keyboard
scanning etc.
By normal interrupt routines what
I mean is that we jump to the routine
that is normally executed when an
interrupt occurs. In other words we]
jump to the routine whose address is
stored in the IR Q  vector when the
computer is switched on.
sn't=
I hope that the above demonstratio
and supporting text makes it a little.
clearer as to what an interrupt is. The
interrupts we have been dealing with
are hardware interrupts t h a t  are
generated every I/50th o f  a second.

There are other ways o f  generating
interrupts, f o r  example the raster
interrupt which can cause an interrupt
depending on the position of the raster
on the TV screen. However, at this
time we don't really need to go into the
other types o f  interrupt as we will
deal with them as required.
1RQ Database
As I have already stated we will be
using interrupts q u it e  frequently
within this series. In order to make
them easier to use with our numerous
routines you will ﬁnd in Figure 3 the
PR O G R AMMIN G
Basic loader for a C64 machine code
routine which I call IR() DATABASE.
Figure 4 has the source for this for
those o f  you who want to follow it
through and see how it works.
This program functions by setting
up a data base' of switches which are
used to turn each routine on and off.
Each routine will be allocated a
position in the database and can be
turned on and off by simply POK Eing
a 1 or 0 into the relevant location of the
database. F or  example on the C64
should you enter:
POKE 839,1
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987

then the Message Scroll routine will be
enabled. Of course the Message Scroll
routine needs to be present in memory
and this will be printed in a later part of
the series.
Next Month
Have you ever wondered how you get
moving objects in programs? If any of
YOU have seen either of  my Nagger
games then the moving conveyor belts
and ladders are the type of  things I
mean. Well next month I will provide a
routine that will allow you to perform
this with ease in your own programs.

extensive program w i t h  a n  ov er-
whelming selection of  options which,
in my opinion, give it a very high rating
in the operative ﬁeld of creating your
own graphics stationary. Performance
is s mooth, impeccable a n d  t h e
program is dedicated to the user in
every respect.
On loading, the main menu gives the
following options: Greeting Car d,
Sign, Stationary, Calendar, Banner,
Graphic Editor and setup. The latter is
for printer output options: while Print-
master ( P M )  i s  pres et f o r  t h e

So what do we choose ﬁrst from the
main menu? I would suggest Graphics
Editor to familiarise yourself with the
graphics on the disk and also to experi-
ment with creating your own graphics.
Having highlighted this option, choose
'graphics by picture'... Here you will
ﬁnd 120 plus inbuilt graphics for your
inspection and use!! Some o f  these
graphics ar e relatively standard, a
large proportion are very novel, but
each a n d  every one is  very w ell
designed for maximum graphic effect.
On display with y our  graphics,
there is a side menu which allows you
to edit, clear, invert, ﬂip horizontally,
ﬂip vertically, save to disk or  print
(each graphic occupies three blocks on
saving): inversion and ﬂipping are
shown very rapidly on screen. Editing
Creat your own headed paper, greetings cards or other

and creating both have four functions
controlled b y  F l  w h ic h  handles
drawing, s hading, t o g g lin g  a n d
erasing. Dr awing gives solid lines,
shading giv ed dotted lines  w hile
toggling draws and erases where lines
corss: the shading and toggling com-
bination gives excellent 3D effects. All
functions are joystick controlled, F l
setting the mode of operation for you.
Cards
Greeting Card: Here there are seven
borders f r o m  w h ic h  t o  choose,
including a few unconventional ones
such as  'crawling ants' -  the pro-
grammers really enjoyed making this
software. Eight fonts are available and
there is space for seven lines of text (39
column width) so there is no need to
stick to the usual conventional, cryptic
greeting. Both upper case and lower
case may be used. Naturally a graphics
selection is available in either small,
medium or large mode.
Now the program really gets inter-
esting y o u  can stagger your graphics
in a set manner or place them where
you wish. At  this point the function
keys 1, 3, 5 and 7 interplay with one
another. F l  positions writing to left
centre or right; F3 alters size FS alters
style while F7 alters the font. Effect-
ively then, you may interchange posi-
tions and change fonts within any one
graphic; should y ou overﬂow with
enthusiasm, the screen will say so and
it can be sorted out with the delete key.
While you are still creating a Greetings
Card, there is a Front Page and an
Inside Page for you to use.

What have you done?
Now keep moving along (plenty o f
screen prompts) and you will be given
the chance to PREVIEW what you
have done. This, I think, is an excellent
option. If you don't like what you have
designed, back-step w i t h  t h e  k ey
and change it all. For a really radical
change go back to the Main Menu and
start all over again. If you like it save
the whole thing to disk for use at a later
date (change a few names around when
you reload if you wish) or print it out
directly. Now who could ask for more
than that?
The I function i s  operative a l l
through the program and allows you
to back-step at any point for editing.
Making Signs
The SI G N  Fac ility  operates i n  a
similar manlier, and gives you a one
page presentation with all the facilities
described above including seven lines
of entry.
Stationary naturally creates your
own paper heading. Here the graphics
may be to the left, to the right, 'tiled' or
a row of tiles. Both the top and bottom
of the page are programmable: note -
the RESTO RE K e y  stops pr inter
output -  so don't go too far away or
you will have multiple pages at your
feet. On the other hand, try half a page
if you want!
What's the date?
The CALENDAR: very good is this:
again chose your graphics, and font,

•
plus months a n d  year. Th e  1 2
calendar months are listed and are
selected by highlighting; the year is
listed as 1986 which may be changed as
directed: you are now asked for a
monthly or weekly calendar,
The Monthly calendar selection
gives th e  menu: continue, a l te r
heading, and enhance date.
With 'alter heading' the font may
be clanged with F7 while the typed
heading at the top may be altered with
the delete key and input from the key-
board. Anyway assuming that you are
quite happy with what you see, select
'enhance date': from this option you
can now enter three lines o f  ﬁve
characters each for any one date to
remind you of who's who and what's
what. Again you get a preview of your
y of m o n t h l y  calendar picture.

M
things said I was crazy to try, but I
wanted to build something to add on
to my C64. I think I found the ideal
beginner's project in a cheap drum
synthesizer kit from Maplins, a large
electronics chain and mail order ﬁrm.
Computadnim i s  supplied as a
packet of components with a printed
circuit board. The kit will work with a
number of different micros including
the C64 and Vic 20. It should also work
on a CI 28 in C64 mode, but I haven't
tried it.
The unit provides six separate
channels, or different drum sounds.
Each channel can be tuned for pitch
and resonance by altering the setting of
variable registers on the circuit board
with a small screwdriver. Software can
be used to switch each channel on or
off and to control the time between
each beat. You might think this would
give access to six sounds only. You'd
be wrong. The six channels can be
mixed in any combination. In effect,
this gives you access to a large variety
of sounds.
I'm told, by my friend who knows,
that commercial drum synthesizers
will d o  more, and th e  software
provided is fancier. The Computadrum
has one big advantage over these- you
construct i t  yourself, and, i n  the
process, learn a  l o t  about th e
wonderful mysteries of the user port.
That's what I now know to call the
hole you can feel on the lefthand side
of the back of your C64!
Signals, controlled b y  t h e
computer, come from this port and are

Building add-ons for your computer sounds like a
daunting task, however Map/ins Coinputadrum makes it
possible for amateurs.
By Neil Day
plugged into the Cotnputadrum unit.
Inside the unit these signals are used to
generate the six drum sounds. The
resulting signals emerge from a lead
from the unit that has to be connected
to the line-in or audio-in socket of an
audio ampliﬁer or monitor.
The packet supplied contains all
but a box to house the unit and the
leads. For the lead into the drum unit
from the C64 computer you need a
seven pin din plug, a couple of feet of
seven way cable for the six lines plus
ground, and a 24 way edge connector
to plug into the computer. The output
lead will depend o n  the type o f
ampliﬁer or monitor or you are going
to use. Most commonly a single RCA
type p l u g  i s  required. A  ve ry
professional looking box to house the
unit can be supplied by Maplins for
about £56O. Cheaper ones a re
available too, or you could probably
improvise one.
lf, l i ke  me , yo u  have never
previously assembled electronic
equipment, you may start out feeling a
bit apprehensive. However, th e
process is easy. Maplins has a little
brochure called Constructors Guide
(ref xh79I). It costs just 25p and tells
you h o w  t o  identify resistors,
capacitors and other such beasts. I
used the magnifying glass out of my
daughter's stamp collection to read the
values off the tiny components. I noted
the value (ohms fo r resistors and
farads for capacitors) on to a scrap of
paper and then wrapped u p  the
components of the same value together
in the paper. This meant that I did all
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987

the identiﬁcation o f  components
(probably the hardest thing of all for
me) in one sweep.
Sticking the components into the
printed circuit board reminds me of
knitting to a pattern, except it's a lot
easier than the fairisle sweater I
laboured over for 18 months! Some
items need to be orientated correctly so
that the positive end goes through the
correct hole in the PCB, but this is
always indicated i n  the very clear
lettering on the board itself.
You are advised to poke in a few
components at a time, and then solder
them into position. You use small
wire-cutters to remove the excess wire,
protruding from the bottom o f the
board, and repeat the process until all
the components are installed.
The last time I used a soldering iron
was to mend the spouting; that was
harder than soldering the components
in place. The detailed advice in the
Constructors' Guide and the project
instructions helped me here. Large
lumps of blue tack secured the board,
leaving tw o  hands free f o r  th e
soldering. The only items that were at
all tricky were the semiconductors
because the pins on these are very close
together. The ﬁner the point on your
soldering iron the easier it is.
Well, putting it all together takes a
few hours, but in the process you read
the excellent instructions and get a
general idea of what each circuit does.
Before long you've soldered the leads
and it's time to test the unit.
Mine didn't work! I checked both
for whiskers o f solder shorting the

tracks on the pcb and the correct
placement of components. These were
all OK. Mv mistake was that I had
assumed th a t t h e  w i re  marked
"ground" from the user port would
wind up attached to the metal shield
round the seven pin plug at the end of
the input cable. I was informed by my
friend, who knows about these things,
that only a person with the brain of a
small gnat would do this but you still
might appreciate the tip. The ground
wire has to be connected to one of the
seven pins. Mis-wiring the cable was
the only construction error I made.
This ﬁxed, I got some convincing
drum sounds, but [ couldn't work out
which o f  the adjustable resistors
altered which o f  the six voices. I t
turned out to be my misunderstanding
of the short program you type in to run
the drum. To turn a line on, or "set it
high" as they say, you have to poke the
appropriate value into register 56577:
for instance binary '70000001 turns on
the ﬁrst line and makes the ﬁrst drum,
called d ru m zero sound: binary

%00000I I turns on lines zero and one
making these two channels of the syn-
thesizer sound simultaneously. M y
problem was that when the program
asked me to type in the drum number. I
assumed that ﬁve would give me drum
number ﬁve and so on. But ﬁve is, in
binary, %0000010I, so i t turns on
drum zero and two together. In other
words you must tell the program to
poke in a denary equivalent o f the
binary value of the drum number. If
you want drum three you need to type
eight (2*2*2 or 2 to the power of 3).
Similarly, drum four is indicated as 16,
and drum live as 32 or two to the
power of live.
All-in-all, building the Computa-
drum kit is very absorbing, and gives
you a good understanding of how the
computer can be used to  control
external equipment. Now I'm looking
for a mail order DIY robot that will
dance to the pulsating rhthym of my
drum machine. He who knows about
these things says I should get in touch
with one of those seamier types of mail

order places that sell a special type of
inﬂatable robot. He says that what I
did when wiring up the cable would
stand me in good stead. You have to
get used to opaque comments like this
from electronics experts when you're
an amateur hardware constructor! r

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R.
U and N .  You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how to ng
you look or how many people help you. you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of E6.00 for disk and E4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation f o r  the programs is  supplied w ith the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFONET LTD, Times House, 179 The Marlowes. Hemel
Hempstead, Herts. 1-11
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions. i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C I 6  and Plus /4
cassettes. However programs for  these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available'?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple of  symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.

hen Commodore launched its
W
range of home computers, the need to
purchase Commodore products in the
future was virtually built in. Should
you require a  disk drive then you
would have to use Commodore's. If
you wanted a printer then you would
have to use Commodore's. Al] this is
due to the fact that the computers have
a non-standard interface.
Most of the popular printers such
as Epson, Star and Citizen come
complete with a centronics interface
making them unuseable w i th  a
Commodore computer. To solve this
problem many parallel interfaces have
been built that enable you to use a
parallel printer with a Commodore
though none o f them have been as
powerful as the Device One from
Precision Software.
The purpose of Device One is basic-
ally to link together a printer with a
parallel interface to the Commodore
computer. The computer talks to the
printer in the normal way i.e. it thinks
it is talking to a Commodore printer
while the interface makes the printer
behave as though it is a Commodore
printer.
The actual casing for the interface
is made from what appears to be a
Vic2O cartridge case. Th e  o n l y
reservations that I  have about the
interface are partly due to this. Only
part of the circuit board is covered and
a large proportion of it is visible to the
outside world. I can't help wondering
if a metallic object such as a paper clip
could ﬁnd its way into the interface
through this opening and cause havoc
to the chips inside.
The interface itself contains I6K of
RAM and 16K of ROM, there are four
built in character fonts, so you can
print listings in different faces. There is
also the facility to print out in your
own fonts, print pictures, calendars
and banners.
HARDWARE R E V I E W
Device One
A printer interface is one of the most important items
you may ever buy. Device One could be just what you're
looking for.
By Stuart Cooke
Documentation
The manual accompanying the inter-
face was printed using Device One and
its different fonts showing the ﬂex-
ibility of the interface. The manual is
extremely clear with many examples
used to illustrate different functions.
Many of the different commands
are extremely difﬁcult to remember.
even though the manual does make it
extremely clear how to use them, the
interface therefore has its own inbuilt
documentation. Hold down the reset
button on the interface for more than
three seconds and a brief summary of'
the available commands w i l l  b e
printed out for you,
In Use
Setting up the interface is extremely
simple. The interface plugs into the
Commodore serial p o rt a n d  th e
printers centronics port. A  th i rd
connection is made with a transformer
to a convenient mains socket.
The interface will work with no less
than 25 different types of printer, all of
the popular types such as Epson etc.
are available. Selection of the printer
type is simply made by altering the
position of three switches on the front
of the interface. Other switches deter-
mine if you require an autoline feed
and the mode of operation of the inter-
face. There are four different modes of
operation, 1525 emulation is, as its title
suggests, to ta l  emulation o f  a
Commodore 1525 printer, you also
have access to all of the Device One
features such as fonts and calendars.
Semi-transparent mode passes all
commands directly t o  the printer
without a n y conversion, however
Device One commands will still work.
Transparent m o d e  passes
characters straight through to  the
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987

printer, Device One commands will
not work.
ASCII mode passes a l  codes
straight through to the printer except
for characters. An y characters are
translated from Pet-ASCII to normal
ASCII s o  th a t they are printed
correctly on your printer.
1525 Emulation
When using this mode all o f  the
Commodore printer commands such
as double size work as you would
expect. This means that you can now
use any program that requires a
Commodore printer without any
problems at all.
Device One Control
There are no fewer than 32 different
commands that can be sent to  the
Device One interface. Commands can
be sent to the interface in one of two
ways. Either you can open a channel to
the printer with a secondary address of
15 e.g.
OPEN 4,4,15
or you can send two escape codes (27)
to the interface before a command.
Obviously there are far too many
commands available to go into them
all so I will concentrate on the main
ones.
Custom Fonts
One command will allow you to select
the font that you would like to use.
There are no fewer than six variations
of this command and for many of them
you must have down-loaded into the
Device One the font that you require,
note this is not the same as one of the
four in-built fonts.
You can select a low-res font which

is made up of 6*8 dots, You may select
a mid-res font which is made up of 8*8
dots. A  hi-res font may be selected
which is made up of I 2*8 dots on an
Epson type printer or I6*8 dots on
some others.
One of the four in-built fonts may
be selected, Figure I gives examples of
each o f  these. You can select your
printers normal font and Underline
can be switched on or off.
Downloading
In order t o get fonts etc. into the
interface you must select one of  the
seveon d o w n l o a d  c o m m a n d s .
Commands exist to download each of
the different styles of font as well as
downloading a picture into the inter-
face's RAM, sending a text ﬁle so that
it is printed in transparent mode and
downloading a  dis k  dr iv e t o  the
printer. Downloading is  extremely
easy since once the interface is told to
download it waits until you send it the
necessary information. T h e  easiest
way to do this is to VERIFY the ﬁle
that you require. This ﬁle isn't read
into memory but is sent down the bus
to the interface.
Printing Pictures
Pictures can be printed in either full-
tone o r  half-tone. Full-tone simply
means that the image is in black and
white while half-tone means that the
interface will use shading to print out
the different colours. In order to print
a picture it must be down-loaded into
the RAM in the interface. Then each
time the interface is told to print a line
HARDWARE R E V I E W
each line o f  the picture is printed.
Should you send text to the printer you
could print this over an illustration.
Printing Calendars
There is an in-built calendar mode in
the interface. This simply prints out a
calendar for a speciﬁed month on your
printer and can be printed in any font.
Banners
This mode will allow you to print any
message sideways on to your printer,
each letter of your message being as
high as the width of the paper.

Laying It Out
Commands exist within the interface
to set the page length of the interface
and the left and right margins. For
anyone who uses a wordprocessor that
doesn't hav e header  a n d  footc r
commands the inclusion of this in the
interface will be a welcome addition.
You c ould even us e headers and
footers to print messages at the top and
bottom of any listings that you print
out.
NLQ
Many people would love to have access
to a daisy-wheel printer which prints
extremely clear characters, however
for most of us the price of these is far
out of our reach and we are therefore
stuck with the dotty products that our
printers provide. The NLQ mode of
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
81
the Device One does improve these
dramatic ally  b y  p r i n t i n g  eac h
character twice. This gives a more pro-
fessional ﬁnish to any printouts.
Software
Not o n ly  does  Device O ne c ome
complete w i t h  i t s  o w n  b u i l t  i n
software, it also comes complete with a
disk full of it for the C64. The software
included is:
Printerizer -  T his  allows  y o u  t o
convert pictures fr om most o f  the
popular packages t o  Device O n e
format.
Font Editor -This allows you to create
your ow n fonts for  use with y our
printer.
Dump All -  This patches into your
machine and allows you to get a screen
dump at any time by holding down a
few keys.
Dump Text -  Similar to the above but
this only prints text.
Draw! -  A  simple drawing package
that allows you to create your own hi-
res pictures.
Print Utility -  A program that makes
printing calendars, banners or down-
loading pictures a n d  fonts  muc h
easier.
Font Capture - This allows you to go
through the memory of the computer
so that you can capture any fonts that
are used within your programs for use
with your printer.
Verdict
Device O ne is  t he mos t powerful
printer interface that I  have come
across for the Commodore range of
machines.
The interface is easy to use and the
manual is  clear enough for  even a
novice computer owner to get to grips
with t h e  interfac e w it h o u t  a n y
problems.
The interface is expensive but well
worth saving your pennies for, and
especially since there are interfaces in
the market that don't do as much and
cost more.

CP/M and the
Commodore128
T
deﬁnitive CP/M and the Commodore
implementation, however this article
should enable you to understand just
what these differences are, plus I hope
to give you an idea o f  the more
common transient programs supplied
with the CP/M+ system.
The Commodore Connection
If you read m y  article i n  Your
Commodore, March 1987, you should
remember that, the CP/M system, as
now deﬁned, requires a Z80 processor,
64K, an 80 column screen and one or
two disk drives. The CP/M+ system,
supplied with the C128, assumes I28K.
In th e  Commodore implemen-
tation there are a couple of changes
made to this initial speciﬁcation_ The
screen can be in either 40 or 80 column
mode and, as most people can only
have one disk drive, there is a software
mechanism fo r  treating i t  as two
separate drives to make copying and
various disk functions easier.
This is achieved through the use of
drive 'E'. Normally to copy between
two disks you need two drives, for
instance 'A ' and 'B'. The computer
takes the information off drive A and
puts it on to drive B. That works ﬁne
for dual drive systems, but most
Commodores only have one drive,
which makes things rather difﬁcult, So
Commodore came up with the drive
'E' system. Specifying a copy between
drives A and E is like a single disk copy
with drive A refering to the original
and E refering to the copy. Although,
you can do it the other way around.
The main point is that drive E doesn't
exist. Only in the minds of the system's
C128 — C P /M MO DE
CP/M, much neglected mode of the C128, is probably
the most useful for the serious user. Here we examine
the Commodore version of this phenomenon.
By Mycroftt Appleby
programmer and everybody knows
that most systems programmers are
deranged anyway. This system is very
good and simple to  use and i s a
brilliant way around a rather tricky
problem. It's much more usual for
Commodore to leave something like
that for the user to sort out.
On Screen
The other anomaly in the Commodore
CP/M system is the ability to use a 40
column screen. This is for the legions
of Cl28 owners who have no 80
column monitor but just one of the old
composite colour monitors or TVs. It
operates b y  having a  40 column
window on a logical 80 column screen.
Everybody must recognise this from a
Large number of wordprocessors that
run on the C64. This is probably the
most ideal solution and the only real
way to  get some o f  the software
working. This said, i t is probably
better to ﬁnd a cheap green screen
monitor and use that instead. There
are some very good ones nowadays for
around .C80 and i t  i s  worth the
investment i f  you are going to use
CP/M for any length of time.
Though CP/M+ was designed to
have a certain amount of room in the
OS for graphical links, CP/M 2.2 th e
operating version that most CP/M
programs were written under h a s
none. So most CP/M programs arc in
monochrome anyway. Other than that_
you are best sticking to software that
will run under 40 column CP/M like
languages or programs written for the
old C64 version of CP/M 2_2.
On the Record
The other difference that is inherent in
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
82
all CP/M systems is the disk format_
The disk format is the way that the disk
controller tells the disk drive to write
to the disk. As most people know, the
process o f writing to a disk is very
similar to that of writing to tape. To
take the analogy further, there are
different ways of writing to tape and
two distinct writing systems. One is
'Helical Scanning' as used in video
recorders and the new Digital Audio
Tape (DAT) system. This is incredibly
complex and is beyond the scope of
this article. The other method is the
straight linear recording system.
Using this method, a  certain
amount of tape will pass the tape head
in a certain amount of time. In that
time a certain amount of data will be
written to the head. There can also be
between one and nine tracks on the
head. Now as we know, different
computers have different methods of
writing data to tape, on tape this is
known as the tape format. But, on disk
it is known as the sector format. Also,
the way in which the head writes to the
tape is different, effectively how the
varying magnetic ﬁeld o f the head
affects the tape.
All these differences also apply to
disks. The amount of data packed on
to a linear of a disk is called the sector
density and can vary between ﬁve and
10 for CP/M disks or 16 and 22 for
Commodore disks. Th e  number
of tracks on a disk can vary between
35,40, and 80. There are three main
ways of writing data to the disk FM,
MFM, and Commodore OCR. And
there are one or two other differences
as well.
So, now you see that there are a lot
of differences between disks, even

1   
C

though they are the same size (imagine
poor old Amstrad users who even use
different types of disks!) the Cl28 has
to be able to read many formats as
possible to be able to make the best use
of CP/M. To do this a novel solution
was found.
The Solution
In the past, Commodore computers
used 35 (or 77 for older machines)
tract, GCR, 22 to 16 sectors per track
and 256 bytes per sector. This format
was designed from the start to  be
reliable, fast, and make the best
possible use of disk space. And indeed
the ﬁgure of 180K for a single aided,
single density, 35 track disk has never
been beaten. However, the rest of the
world started with %Try low density
disk drives and could only modify their
system as the hardware got better.
As you can see, there is no way on
earth that an old Commodore drive
can read the more standard type of
disk. So all you people with 1541s —
hard luck. You can use Commodore
speciﬁc CP/M programs (and there
are quite a few available from ICPUG)
but you won't be able to access any of
the generic CP/M stuff.
No, to read CP/M generic disks
you need to have either a 1570 or 1571.
The difference between the two is that
the 1571 will read and write to both
sides of the disk and the 1570 is only a
single sided drive. What this means is
whilst you could read some CP/M
disks in the single sided drive, you may
have to get them specially written or
only b e  able t o  read h a l f th e
information. So get a 1571, this is the
same drive as the one that is ﬁtted
internally into the C128D.
The 1571 is 40 track double sided,
is capable of FM. MFM, or GCR, and
can hold 200K, 400K, or 368K. This
last mode i s  th e  double sided
Commodore GCR format and is only
really used by the C128 in Commodore
Basic mode and when booting CPM.
200K is available in FM  o r single
density mode and the 400K mode is
MFM or double density mode. These
two modes could make the C128 read
90q o f  all C P/M 2.2 disks ever
written, but instead, the most popular
nine are provided. This still covers the
vast majority of CP/M disks, they are:
IBM 8 sector SS
IBM 9 sector SS
KayPro II
Osborne SS
IBM 8 sector DS
IBM 9 sector DS
KayPro IV
Osborne DS
Epson QX 10
The ﬁrst four formats can be read
by the 1570, all formats can be read by
the 1571. It is interesting to note that
the IBM 9 sector DS is the same format
as used by IBM compatibles when
using CPM-86. This was the Digital
Research answer to  MS-DOS that
never really took off. However, many
IBM compatibles retain the ability to
read or write disks in this format and
so data only transfers are possible.
Another side point is that the Amstrad
CP/M machines (CPC 464 with disks
and CPC 664) and CP/M+ machines
(CPC 6128, PCW 8256, PCW 8512)
can read and write disks in this format.
Transient Commands and
Friends
Last month I explained the concept
and purpose o f  th e  transient
commands along with some o f the
simpler ones that are only really
extensions o f the inbuilt or resident
commands. Afte r these come the
utility programs that can either be
considered as transient commands or
as programs in their own right. They
are usually used as commands when
only one operation is needed, whilst
for multiple operation the stand alone
program mode is more useful.
The most commonly used, and
indeed o n e  o f  the mo st useful
commands is known by the incredibly
informative name of PIP. PIP stands
for Peripheral Interchange Program,
and has been called 'the most powerful
command ever written'. This uses the
deﬁnition of power that derives from
making a lot happen from the fewest
keystrokes possible. However, this is
more to  d o  with PIPs convoluted
shorthand system than anything else.
Effectively, what P IP  does i s  t o
transfer a ﬁle from one device, perform
some action on the ﬁle (or not as the
case may be) and transfer it to another
device.
This command i s  exceedingly
useful, has to  be included on the
systems disk, and i s  rarely even
documented i n  C P/M instructions
supplied with ally CP/M machine. So
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
83
here is the minimum you will have to
know to get it going.
l'iPped at the Post
As mentioned earlier PIP is used to
transfer ﬁles around. The transient
way of using PIP is to be typed 'PIP
xxx' where 'xxx' is the function that
you want to  happen. When this is
completed or an error occurs you will
then drop into the C /PM system
prompt ( A  >  T h e  programmed
method o f using PIP is just to type
'PIP' on its own. You then get the PIP
prompt which i s  a n  asterisk (5 )
followed by the cursor. To  use the
earlier example, if you typed 'xxx' after
this prompt it will be acted upon. The
difference is that after it is ﬁnished or a
recoverable error condition occurs,
you will drop back into the '5' prompt
ready for another command.
The format for the PIP instructions
(I will assume from now on that all
instruction a re  following th e  ' 5 '
prompt) is 'target becomes source
operation'. Either the target or the
source can be either a ﬁle name or a
device and the operations will be
detailed later. The ﬁle names can
support all the wildcards and drive
designations that the more complex
transient commands have. So the most
simple example of the PIP command is
the disk copy 'a:*.* = b;*.*' will copy
the contents of drive 'B' on to drive
'A'. Single ﬁles, and groups of ﬁles can
be copied or even renamed: 'fred.txt
bill_txt" will change the text ﬁle 'bill'
into the text ﬁle 'fred'.
The main use of PIP is to transfer
information between devices.
lempaxt=con:' will accept input from
the keyboard and creat a quick text
hid. 'LPT:=text.txt' will print out the
text ﬁl e  a n d  something l i k e
'BBC.tmp=ios:' will read information
from the serial port (perhaps from
another computer) and create a ﬁle
with it.
However, th e  mo st powerful
function that PIP has is the operations
at the end o f each instruction. The
examples above will do the transfer
with n o  change i n  the tile being
transfered. However, the inclusion of a
few letters after the inStrucion i n
square b r a c k e ts  c a n  change
everything_

PIP is that it is a little convulated to
use, you ﬁnde that there are usually
programs on system disks that will do
some o f  the functions o f  PIP (like
copier programs for instance) with a
little more regard for user friendliness,
but none of them have the power and
versatility that PIP can provide if it is
understood properly.

an excellent k ey boar d w h ic h  i s
complemented by' a numeric keypad
situated on the right. At  ﬁrst glance
this would brighten any programmer's
heart. Y o u  c ould be mistaken f o r
thinking that it can be used for keying
in data statements. But ,  o n  more
careful examination, it becomes clear
that the keypad has been primarily
designed f o r  accounting data entry
with ' - '  and '.'-keys, Normal Basic
data statements cannot be entered with
it. Or can't they?
I realised, that with a little effort.
the keypad could be redeﬁned to meet
this need. Hence the bir th o f  the
Keypad Modiﬁer.
Purpose
This is  a  machine language utility
which resides at the unused RAM at
5000. This start location is deﬁned in
line 40 as variable AD. The value of
this can be changed if  required and a
working version of the program will be
POKEd to that location and onwards.
The program redeﬁnes the '+' key
as DEL. This is useful when you make
a mistake in your data statements. The
'+' key is located on the top right of the
keypad just like the DEL key on the
normal keyboard, and this makes it
very. convenient to use.
The '-' key, when depressed, prints
the word D AT A on the screen. •The

comma, required t o  separate t h e
numbers in a data statement, is now
available using the '.• key. The number
and ENTER (or RETURN) keys act as
usual.
Hints on Loading
The Basic loader accompanying the
program POKES the data. If you own
a disk drive, the loader will generate a
binary ﬁle with the name you specify.
Later, whenever you want to use this
utility, jus t enter: BO O T  " F I L E -
NAME" t o  load and activate the
modiﬁer,
Tape owners can enter the built-in
MONITOR and save the machine code
IAA I h : S"Fl LEN AM E",0 +5000,+5067.
The machine code can then be loaded
with: L O A D  " ﬁle n a m e
should then type NEW and SYS 5000
to activate.
in Use
The best way to use this utility is to ﬁrst
use the AUTO feature of Basic. Type
in the ﬁrst line number and press
space. Now you can forget the main
keyboard. Just press the '- ' at  the
beginning of a new line, the number of
which will be automatically printed if
you are using AUTO. Then enter the
numbers pressing t o  separate them
and press ENTER to enter the line, If
you make a mistake press '+' to delete.1115

ﬁrst appear odd but it is, in fact, a
motto used by the FORTH Interest
Group (FIG) meaning "Go FORTH
and multiply". What I intend to do is
propose some arguments in favour of
the use of FORTH as the alternative
programming language.
Basic Disadvantages
LAN G U AG E

&
The majority of Commodore users are
probably pr ogr amming i n  Bas ic .
Whilst Basic adequately fulﬁls  it s
original function as an aid to teaching
pr ogr amming, i t  h a s  s e r io u s
drawbacks which hinder its use for
serious applications:
i) Basic lacks the structural constructs
which ease the creation of logical and
easily understood programs. If you've
err tried to understand, alter or debug
a Basic program written by someone
else, you'll know what I mean.
ii) Being a n  interpreted language,
Basic is both slow and uses memory
inefﬁciently.
iii) Basic is inﬂexible.
Two important points must be
emphasised. First, the enhanced Basics
available t o  BBC  and I B M  c lone
owners are more efﬁcient to use but are
Tired of your old programming language? Want to try

obviously machine dependent. If you
want to  have a  program which is
transportable t o  other machines,
forget i t .  Secondly, yo u  can get
compilers which will speed up routines
and save space. They do not, however,
make the job of programming easier.
For all these reasons, many people
will eventually become dissatisﬁed
with Basic and will seek an alternative.
Those interested in arcade games will
generally choose machine code. Those,
however, who do not seek the highest
speed execution w i l l  w a n t a n
alternative high level language. For the
C641C128, the alternatives are limited
to PASCAL and FORTH. Those of
you who own an Amiga will also have
the option o f  C.PASCAL (and its
derivative MO D U LA)  is a powerful
and well structured language but for
power, structure, speed and elegance,
FORTH takes some beating.
Forth Advantages
I do not intend to describe the FORTH
language in  detail since the books
listed later will do the job better than I
can. Instead, I  want t o  discuss the

FORTH philosophy arid hopefully
whet your appetite.
The ma i n  difference between
FORTH and other languages is its
approach to deﬁning instructions or
words. In Basic, instructions such as
MILAL 3, PRINT etc. have ﬁxed and
clearly speciﬁed fu n cti o n s o r
meanings. Whilst FORTH uses a
vocabulary o f  b a s i c  w o r d s
(primitives), they are completely
ﬂexible and may be changed at will. If,
for example, you want the instruction
3 to really represent 11, it is a trivial
matter to make the change. This ability
to deﬁne your own words and add
them t o  t h e  vocabulary gives
programming an added dimension. It
also makes the creation and use o f
Procedures b o th  primitive a n d
awkward.
Consider t h e  e xa mp l e  i n
Listing I.
Here I have deﬁned three words,
COLOURCHANGE, FL ASH  a n d
MESSAGE. Each deﬁnition is held in
the section between the :  and ; .
COLOURCHANGE increments the
screen colour (in $0021) b y one.
FLASH uses a loop to increment the
screen colour 255 times. MESSAGE
uses the ﬂashing screen effect i n
con juction with a printed message to
give a nasty effect. The three words are
added to the vocabulary and can be
used in any subsequent words. In other
words, a completely user deﬁneable
language.
If this ﬂexibility wasn't enough,
FORTH offers a  combination o f
interpretor and compiler. When you
write the program; you are in fact
creating some form of text ﬁle using an
editor. When any word i s t o  be
executed, the text is compiled. Since
the primitives are efﬁciently deﬁned in
terms of simple machine code jumps,
the compiled words are converted to a
simple linked list o f  machine code
instructions. This results in compact
code which executes quickly.
Inside FORTH
Originally, FORTH was written using
virtual memory held on disk, To do
this, text is held in a series of screens
each comprising of 1024 bytes. Within
these screens, the text can be laid out in
almost any format allowing the use of
LAN G U AG E
indenting and other tricks to give a
well structured format as shown in
Listing 1. Since many C64 users don't
own a disk drive, many FORTHS use a
RAM-disk approach t o  storing
screens. Wh i l st th e  software i s
different, th e  perceived mode o f
operation is unchanged. This system of
text input is extremely satisfying since
the use o f virtual memory on disk
presents n o  penalty f o r  using
explanatory comments. Listing 3
shows what can be done.
In terms of capabilities, standard
FORTH offers all of the structure you
Listing 2
: FACTORIAL (n -- factorial)
DUP I- IF
DUP I- MYSELF *
THEN
could ask for. The standard constructs
are:
DO L O O P
IF...ELSE...THEN
BEGIN U N T I L
BEGIN W H I L E  R E P E A T
CASE is not standard but can be
easily implemented. Using such
constructs with the unique "word"
system, i t  i s  remarkably easy t o
develop a  linear approach t o
programming without recourse to un-
satisfactory constructs such as GOTO.
In addition, the ability to nest words is
conductive to the analysis of a problem
by use of top-down design.
Here are a  couple o f  further
examples. Listing 2 shows a routine for
the calculation of the factorial o f a
number. The routine is recursive in
that i t  calls itself via the word
MYSELF.
YOUR COMMODORE anril 1987
87
Much o f the speed and power of'
FORTH derives from its use of a stack
to hold values currently in use. Not
only does the stack allow the rapid
manipulation of data, but values can
be easily passed to words. The word
DUP in Listing 2 is used to duplicate
the value at the top of the stack. The
functioning of the routine is as follows:
I. The routine is entered with the
number on the top of the stack.
2. It is duplicated to preserve it and it
is decremented.
3. If the number is greater than one,
the routine calls itself.
4. If the number is equal to one, the
results o f  each call itself are
multiplied together.
You might ﬁnd i t interesting to
compare Basic routine to do the job to
Listing 2.
Listing 3 also uses recursion. Can
you sort out what it does?
Listing 4 gives a ﬁnal example. This
time I have a real application. Three
example screens are shown for a music
system on a Tandy TRS-80 Mk I using
an AY-3-8910. D o n ' t  t r y  t o
understand how i t works — simply
consider how neat the lay out is and
how unlike a normal program it is. The
use o f normal English gives a user-
friendly program which i s  easily
altered by another user.

What's Available
So you've had the sales pitch and
you're lusting to  start hacking i n
FORTH,There remains the question
as to what is available.
First, there is the software. The
ﬁrst point to make is that FORTH
users are a sensible lot when it comes to
making systems available and it should
be a simple matter to get hold of a
public d o m a i n  s y s te m . T r y
contacting th e  FOR TH  Interest
Group. Alternatively, there are a few
systems which can be obtained for
cash.
Probably the most powerful system
is White Lightening from Oasis. This
was marketed as a games package and
consequently offers a large number of
graphics extensions. Both virtual
memory o n  disk and R AM disk
versions a r e  available. H i g h l y
recommended.
Melbourne House publishes
A bersoft's FIG FORTH for the 64.
This offers some graphics extensions
but i s  otherwise quite standard.
Although it is simple to transfer it to
disk, only RAM-disk is supported.
ROMIK (now defunct) offers no
frills FORTH. This is quite a decent
version and, if you shop around, you
may pick it up cheap.
There are also versions from MPE
and FORTHWITH but I  have not
evaluated either.
If you're really cool, trendy and
lucky, you might be able to pick up a
LA N G U A G E
Jupiter Ace. Fo r you who haven't
heard o f it, the Jupiter Ace was a
FORTH based micro rather in the
mould of the ZX8I (try Boldﬁeld Ltd
Computing).
Unfortunately, the instructions
with most low cost FORTHs are poor
and mu st b e  supplimented b y
bookware. The range of books is wide
(the FORTH Interest Group has a
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
88
bibliography) but two are worthy of
comment. Both are b y  the same
author, Leo Brodie: Starting FORTH,
Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-12-842922-7:
Thinking FORTH. Prentice Hall, ISBN
0-13-917568-7.
Both are worthy additions to any
serious computer user's library and
cater for users of all abilities.
I hope you have found this brief
summary of FORTH of value. Unlike
many languages, FORTH has the
power and ﬂexibility to grow with your
own abilities and provide an effective
and elegant solution t o  y o u r
programming programs.

Sound Expander Package earlier this
year? Did you thrill to the Country
Banjos riff and Telstar demonstration?
Did you then ﬁnd that your key-board
talents, no matter how great, would
not allow you to produce anything
sounding half as good as what the
machine could play on its own? Dis-
illusioned, did you give up your Learn
to Play Keyboards course, and leave
your ISO investment gathering dust
under your bed? If you have answered
'yes' to any o f the above questions,
then hear the good news: the long
awaited Composer/Editor software for
the Sound Expander has arrived, and
even at the slightly painful price of
£24.95, it's a must.
At the time of writing, only the disk
version was available, and that only
with a photo-copy of the instruction
manual, but a cassette version should
be with us soon.
The Composer
The d i sk contains t w o  separate
programs: the FM Composer and the
FM Sound Editor. I will deal with the
Compower ﬁrst, This allows you to
enter standard music notation on to a
double stave, over nine channels. The
notes can be input from the external
ﬁve-octave keyboard, nothing new to
MIDI fanatics, but to those of us who
have struggled up through U l ti -S
The Music Studio, The Sound System,
etc.. this is a new experience in terms of
ease and speed.
MUSIC
Expanding
Systems
Many people who bought the Commodore Sound
Expander may have found it too much for their novice
status. Perhaps this Music Sales Composer Editor will
help.
By S.I. Chance
Of course, i f you don't have the
external keyboard, notes can b e
entered fromt he computer keyboard,
though this is a much more cumber-
some way of doing things. Having the
computer keyboard operating as a
music keyboard does mean that a lot of
other functions are relegated to the
remaining keys.
Dotted notes, ti e s, triplets,
dynamics, variations in tempo, all are
supported by the program, but they
are entered via a system of using the
function keys to scroll through the
options, which I  found irritatingly
clumsy,
Another minor gripe is that to
move the cursor fromt he beginning of
a music-ﬁle to  the end involves i t
lurching its way through all the music
in between which, with a piece of any
length, can take a couple of minutes.
The thing to do here is to break the
music down into smaller sections with
the 'sequence' option.
Repeats i n  t h e  mu si c a r e
supported, including repeats with
different endings, which enables one to
make optimum use of memory space,
not that the program doesn't leave
plenty of RAM available.
Once entered, your music can be
saved (only to  disk from the disk
version). edited, and dumped to  a
Printer. The Print-out is more readable
than some, and doesn't have the
problem o f  over-lapping quavers
appearing to be semi-quavers which
occurs with The Music Studio.
The music can be played back, in
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
89
whole or in part. at any stage, and in
any of 64 different voices.
The Editor
Moving on to the Sound Editor, this
does exactly what it says it does. The
sounds from the existing library can be
altered, or new ones created. There are
quite a few parameters to muck about
with, and you don't have to have a clue
what you are doing to  get some
interesting results. If you are short on
inspiration, there i s  also a  Fruit

promoted as one of the major uses of
computers i n  th e  coming years.
However, in the past home control
systems were expensive, difﬁcult to
use, and were only available on micros
with good, complex interfacing
systems like the BBC Micro. More
common co mp u te rs l i k e  t h e
Commodore 64 were not really used at
all. One unbuffered user port that
doubled as an RS232, and an obscure
custom serial system, isn't really the
stuff that interfacing dreams are made
of.
Finally, there is now on the market
an easy to use home control system
that is available across a  range o f
micros including the Commodore 64.
The starter pack f o r  Red Boxes
comprises the main controller —
called 'Red Leader', and two control
units — an infra-red detector (red two)
and a plug actuator (red one). The
concept behind the Red Boxes is the
controller unit 'talking' to all the other
units via a modulated serial link via the
mains.
Red Leader is a computer in itself.
Comprising a  6502 derivative
processor just like the C64, 8K of RAM,
and a  BBC-like control Basic. The
Commodore 64 connects to this and is
used as a terminal. The way this is done
is extremely clever. A wire is connected
on the C64. Press 'Run/Stop' and the
Red Leader behaves just like a cassette
player, sending cassette-type signals to
the Commodore 64.
HARDWARE
Red Boxes
Now there's a home control system available for the
C64, which will switch on the kettle and the telly or even
warn of intruders.
By Mycrolit Appleby
After a short time the terminal
program is loaded into the computer
and the link between the Red Leader
and the Commodore 64 turns into a
proper two-way serial link. You will
then drop into the control program
mode.
This mode is the simplest operating
method on the Red Boxes system (the
other being Red Basic, but more of
that later). You are presented with a
menu where you can log-on devices
(i.e. tell Red Leader that they exist)
type in their code addresses. turn them
on or off and set them up to turn on or
off at speciﬁc times. You can even
relate the input of one to the output of
another so that a movement on the
infra-red detector will activate an
alarm for instance.
This program. w h i l st being
extremely simple, i s  also quite
powerful and lets you perform all the
major actions that you would want to
in a quick and easy manner. However
for complex, multi-unit, interaction
you need to get down to some planning
and programming. For this you need
to use Red Basic and probably need to
get hold of the Projects Manual (good
value at 9
Documentation
The manual supplied gives you some
simple information on the Basic, but is
really aimed at the inexperienced user
so goes into more detail about the
menu program. The Projects Manual

on the other hand, is one of the better
tomes that I have read. Going into
enough detail fo r  the experienced
programmer o u t t o  d o  something
really ﬂashy, or the beginner who is au
fait with Commodore Basic and wants
to get down to using Red Basic.
If you have ever used a BBC micro
you will be immediately used to Red
Basic as Red Basic is a subset of BBC
Basic, with a lot of extra commands
added to handle the control aspect of
the system. If you think that Red Basic
being the same as BBC Basic is a little
strange, then you won't when you hear
about th e  Founder o f  General
Information Systems (the people who
make Red Boxes). Chris Curry (for it
is he) started Acorn many years ago
and this is one of the ﬁrst projects that
he has embarked on since the Acorn
shake up.
As well as most of the BBC Basic
commands and instructions — which
includes most o f  the structured
programming aids (repeat, gosub
name, long variable names etc.) there
are commands to log-on devices and
manipulate them. As this Basic is a lot
more advanced than the Commodore
64 Basic, you should have no trouble at
all in telling units to do whatever you
want, especially with the real-time
commands. These are commands that
are very similar to some commands on
the Amstrad. Sections of program are
executed when an external device
instructs them. So if the timer section
of your program is controlling the

heating and a burglar trips the infra-
red motion detector then the 'alarm'
section o f  your program can b e
activated.
8K may not sound like a lot, but try
and think o f the last time that you
wrote a program that was actually 8K
in length. Remember, you don't have
to worry about screen o r  colour
memory, o r sprites, or sound. The
Commodore 64 handles all of that.
And i f Basic is a bit tight you can
always switch to machine code.
The Red Leader uses a  6502
processor, and you can program it in
machine code by pokeing code into
memory and then executing it. The
Projects manual c a m s  a  list o f
operating system functions which are
very similar in a lot of ways to the
Commodore Kernal system. The Basic
has the same memory management
aids as the original BBC Basic with
pseudo-variables like Page and Top to
indicate when the Basic program is
going to sit, and Lomem and Himem
to reserve space for the machine code
area. Th e  operating system a n d
memory areas are also very similar to
the BBC, even down to where the
system memory ends.
The Basic can also save any
programs written under it to a tape
connected to the Commodore 64. To
do this, the Red Leader ﬁrst transfers
the contents of its memory to the C64.
You must then disconnect Red Leader
and connect up a tape recorder, and
write t o  tape. Th e n  re-connect
everything up.
The main plugs of this system is
that when you have a  program
debugged and working to your satis-
faction, y o u  c a n  u n p l u g  t h e
Commodore 64 from Red Leader
completely and use it for something
else or whatever. Yet, Red Leader will
just sit there executing your program
forever. However, you can leave your
Commodore 64 connected if you want
to — if you need to see information
displayed on the screen for instance —
though the power consumption over a
period o f time would be offputting.
The Red Leader on its own uses up
very little power, and it is feasible to
leave it switched on all the time.
Reds One and Two
The two units supplied with the starter
pack are Red One and Red Two
(sounds a bit like something out o f
Apocalypse Now). Red One is the
HARDWARE
actuator. This is a unit that plugs into
the mains at one end and then has a
mains socket at the other. Anything
you like can be connected to this and
turned on and off from Red Leader.
There is also a manual override on the
unit to toggle it on and off as you see
ﬁt. A n  LED on the box tells you
whether it is on or off.
Red Two is an infra-red motion
detector. One end plugs into the mains
(as usual) and at the other end is a
small box about half the size of Red
One and Red Leader. In this is a large
window. I f  anything that i s a t a
different temperature th a n  t h e
surrounding air moves within 16 feet
of it then a signal is sent back to Red
Leader.
All three units come with wall
mounting brackets with all screws and
Rawlplugs, though they don't need to
be wall mounted, it is excellent that
these are included. The cables are also
very long, over six feet in most cases.
This is just about the right length.
Usually on systems such as these the
cables are not quite long enough. I
think that they got it right this time.
In the near future GIS will be
releasing an alarm unit and an analog
input unit. These will allow you to
build up an alarm system more easily
or control a thermostat for heating.
Next in line are temperature probes
and an RS232 link.
This last unit will allow your
computer to  talk t o  a  printer i n
another room, o r  even another
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
96
building, by sending its information
down the mains line. This could also be
used in networking computers in a
simple and easy manner.
If anyone is worrying about the
mains system, don't. It is perfectly safe
and very well worked out. Each unit
has its own unique serial number and
the Red Leader has to know what it is.
So whilst yiou could control your next
door neighbour's heating system,
you'd have to  know his encryption
code ﬁrst. However, if you wanted to
communicate with a friend down the
road, as long as you were on the same
local ring main, and within a  few
hundred yards, you could do it.
Verdict
On the whole this is a brilliant system.
One of my main interests in computers
is in the ﬁeld of real event control. And
this is the easiest to use, safest, and
most well thought out system that I
have ever seen. This only obstacles in
its path are public resistance to this
sort o f thing, and the price which,
though low for a control system, is
still high for the average Commodore
owner. I will watch this with interest.

Your opinions are what counts. Let us know how you
feel about anything connected with Commodore
CO mputers.
.
of Your Commodore January '87, I was
interested in an article by Stuart Cooke
on Fault Finding. I am sure that a lot
of readers will ﬁnd it very helpful.
It wasd not long after purchasing
my ﬁrst computer that I  came up
against a problem which I found very
frustrating. I t  was the difﬁculty o f
typing i n  listings without making
mistakes. Although I can type about
35 words per minute when writing a
letter, it is quite a different problem
trying to read the listing and type at the
same time. I have to see the keys and
see where my ﬁngers are going. Thus
when constantly having to stop and
read the listing, then remember it, the
task could be quite infuriating.
After giving the matter some
thought I devised a method that has
worked perfectly fo r  myself, and
perhaps it may be of use to others.
I record the whole program on a
tape recorder at such a speed that when
played back, i t  allows me t o  sit
comfortable and type merrily away
without having to take my eyes off the
keyboard. If a foot switch is inserted in
the control line for stop and start of the
recorder it is possible to stop at once
correct the mistake, or if the recording
has got a little ahead of your typing
catch up before operating the foot
switch once more,
It does take time to  record the
listing, but the elimination of constant
mistakes in typing and most of all the
frustration o f continually correcting
them, has been a great boon.
I hope that this suggestion will be
of value to other readers.

Unfortunately, this is not the ﬁrst
time I have lost out on clubs who start
in a blaze of enthusiasm and disappear
within a month or so. My experience is
probably shared by hundreds of other
computer owners whose eagerness is
blunted by being ripped off in a similar
fashion.
I can only suggest that your readers
think twice before parting with their
cash, particularly if the publication is
not available at a newsagent like your
own magazine.
David Jackson, Luton
We would like to recomnwnd to readers
that they check out the reputation of
computer clubs as far as possible Wore
parting it ﬁb any money. If you have any
reason at all to doubt the reliability of a
club then don't send attr money. 1CPUG
is probably the most weit known
Commodore club and they may be able
to give _roll information as to speciﬁc
groups or clubs which they have checked
out themselves. Contact: 1CPUG, 30

W
ien printing text on the screen
of a Commodore 64 you are normally
stuck with the standard small size
character set, Should you require to
attract someone's attention to a piece
of text then you can change the colour,
reverse it etc.
This program, for the C64, makes
it possible to highlight your text with
double size characters (I6x 16) adding
a new dimension to your text displays.
The program is written entirely in
machine code. The version printed
here is presented in the form of a Basic
loader which POKEs the machine code
and th e  new character set i n to
memory.
Also printed here is a  demon-
stration program which is automatic-
ally loaded b y  the machine code
loader,
In Use
This program makes it possible to have
both the new expanded character set
and the normal C64 character set on
screen a t any one time. Switching
between the two character sets is
extremely easy. Insert a CONTROL-D
character into a print statement and
the text will appear in double size
print, A CONTROL-N character will
return things to normal, The demon-
stration program makes this a little
clearer.
The machine code program has
four sections.

a) A  machine code routine that turns
off the interrupts, wedges in the new
vectors for the double height program
and moves the new character set from
$0800 to $1000.
b) The new interrupt routine. This
looks fo r  raster interrupts at pre-
deﬁned lines that correspond to the
text lines. When the interrupt occurs
the character set and next raster line
are set.

look out for new programs, hints and
tips, articles and even regular series. In
fact i f  you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think  we may be interested in.
Flow do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us. We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but i f  you d o
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
I) I f  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required — disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SUBMISSIO NS
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
Following at the head of the page;
Interrupts/J.Smith/1
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining,
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of  each page you
should put the word MORE if  there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances us e a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
II) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.
YOUR COMMODORE april 1987
101
13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides. We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it  just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  c omplex ity o f  program,
presentation o f  program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between £10.00 and
000.00.
16) A l l  payments are made in  the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we ﬁnd it unsuitable
for publication, then y o u  s hould
enclose a  stamped s elf addressed
envelope.
19) The last and most important point
to make is 'get writing', we are waiting
for your articles.

y
listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example. [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA1111 would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC-41 o r, exceptionally, [SSPC.4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding
Easy Entry C64 I A
Listings
Get it right ﬁrst time with our deluxe program system
‘
down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],1C*1
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T I will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by enterine, the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE anril 1987
102
:CC=2*[PI]*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie, the pi symbol).

Checksum Program
The hexadecimal numbers appearing
in a column to the left of the listing
should n o t be typed i n  with the
program. These are merely checksum
values and are there to help you get
each line right. Don't worry i f you
don't understand the hexadecimal
system, as long as you can compare
two characters on the screen with the
corresponding two characters in the
magazine yo u  ca n  use o u r  line

Type in the Checksum Program,
make sure that you've not made any

immediately because it will be used

Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error si riply correct it and

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49I52 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checks= lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS
command.
No system is foolproof but the
chances of two errors cancelling one
another out are so remote that we
believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.
So get typing!

Adrian Antics
The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole, is
not only a popular book and TV series
it is doomed also to enter the world of
computer games published b y  the
Virgin Games. I f  y ou're already
currently experiencing the hell o n
earth, affectionately known as your
teens, then y ou may  ﬁnd a  lot  t o
identify with in this comedy game. I f
you left this phase of your life behind a
long time ago, then it may serve to
refresh your memory.
The game has been programmed
by Level 9 in conjunction with Mosaic
Publishing and will be available for the
C64/I 28 at E9,95.
This month we've decided to run a
caption competition i n  connection
with Adrian's growing pains so have a
good l o o k  a t  t h e  accompanying
picture (published courtesy of Thames
Television) and see if you can come up
with an apt witty caption to describe
Adrian's obvious domestic bliss. The
best caption will win 1:5.
Bug Finder
BACK PAGE
E
At Your Commodore, we try to publish
high quality  programs that are o f
beneﬁt to as many readers as possible.
This gener ally  means  t h a t  t h e
programs are often very large and can
be prone to typing errors. In order to
make your life a little easier, we run a
Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking,
you still can't get the program to run,
then send us the following:
Two copies of your program on tape or
disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible, a listing of your work (you
may Omit this).
A stamped, self addressed envelope for
El
return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made any errors and place a
corrected copy of the program back on
to your tape or disk before we return it
to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it  stops working. Check it
yourself ﬁrst, i f  you don't, it  only
wastes valuable time that could be
spent working on the magazine.
We d o  get a  large number o f
queries in the ofﬁce, so it may take a
little time for yours to be processed.
Note: We can only deal with problems
concerning programs published i n
Your Commodore.
