ince Facebook Messenger
launched six years ago,
the app has introduced a
variety of extra features. You can
now play games, engage with
chatbots, swap videos and share
aspects of your life via Messenger
Day. However, all these extras eat
up data and put a strain on older
phones with limited storage and
slow processors, and make using
Messenger more cumbersome over
a slow internet connection.
To tackle this problem, Facebook
has finally brought Messenger Lite
to the UK after debuting it in 100
mostly developing countries. Just
install it on your Android phone
or tablet, then log in with your
usual Facebook details. You can
make free calls over Wi-Fi; send
messages, photos, videos and
links; and hold
group chats,
all without the
unnecessary bloat.
Crucially, the
app takes up just
10MB of space and
uses data very
efficiently, making
it ideal if you’re on
a limited mobile
plan or just want
a faster way of
communicating.
It also ensures
Messenger continues
working, even if your network
coverage or Wi-Fi is patchy.
The only disappointment
is that Facebook is not making
the app available on iOS.

only be viewed using the augmented-reality feature within
Snapchat. To view the dog,
go to the location shown on
the website and you’ll see a
Lens indicator that tells you

If modern music sounds
like a mass of awful noise
and you prefer the hits
of your youth, then you’ll
love Spotify’s nostalgic
new Time Capsule
feature. This takes you
down a musical
memory lane by
selecting the songs it
reckons you loved back
in your teens. To unlock
the feature, simply
search for Time Capsule
in Spotify’s desktop
or mobile app or go to
the above address in
your browser. Provided you’re over the age of 16,
Spotify’s algorithms will work out what you’re likely to have
listened to way back when. You’ll then be presented with
a personalised playlist of 30 or so songs lasting two hours.
We found its choices surprisingly accurate, from Oasis and

How will it affect you?
Firefox Quantum’s great leap forward is
that it uses the multiple processor cores
that run on many computers. This means
that pages load much faster and use
less of your PC’s memory, so browsing
the web with Quantum won’t slow down
your system like some others browsers
do – yes, we’re looking at you, Chrome.
The interface is now cleaner and
sharper but there’s more to the redesign
than mere aesthetics: it’s been created
to work better on touchscreen devices
and on larger displays, so Firefox will
excel on a wider range of hardware.
For those already using Firefox,
one major obstacle to overcome will
be the change to extensions.
Older plugins designed for
previous versions of Firefox
may not work until their
developers update them, so it
may be worth holding off
before upgrading, or checking
first on Mozilla’s Add-ons site
(addons.mozilla.org) to see if
a tool you depend on is
incompatible with Quantum.
The full, stable version of
Firefox 57 will arrive on 14
Mozilla claims that Firefox Quantum is twice as
fast as previous versions of the browser
Firefox is reborn with
‘twice as fast’ Quantum
What happened?
As we reported in our ‘Stop using
Firefox’ feature in Issue 433, Mozilla’s
browser has slipped in popularity over
the past few years, but the new
version that’s about to arrive may
give you reason to switch back.
The battle between the
browsers was a two-horse race
back in 2008, with Mozilla’s
Firefox a welcome alternative to
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.
That year, Firefox held a quarter of
browser users, while IE dominated
with about two-thirds. Within a few
years of launch, Chrome’s fast
loading times had elevated it to the
top spot, knocking Firefox back to a
tenth of the market share.
Mozilla is now fighting back with a
massive refresh of Firefox’s code that it
claims will double your browsing speed.
The updated browser has already
arrived in beta form as Firefox 57, which
is a more significant release than it
sounds, with Mozilla dubbing it ‘Firefox
Quantum’. The changes are mostly in
the back end, in the engine that powers
the browser, but there’s also a new
interface that ditches Firefox’s rounded
tabs for a more modern look.
At the same time, Mozilla announced
that it will stop supporting Firefox on
Windows XP and Vista from June 2018.
Chrome has already dropped support
for those old operating systems and
Microsoft itself no longer supports IE
on XP. However, IE8 is still receiving
security updates on Vista.
November but if you want a sneak peek
before then, the beta is already
available from bit.ly/firebeta434.
If you’re still using Windows XP
or Vista, it’s time to update your
operating system. Microsoft no
longer updates XP or offers
security patches, and running
an unsupported browser
leaves the door wide open
for hackers to access your
machine. At the very least,
you should upgrade to the
latest version of Vista, then you
can keep using IE8 to stay safe.
Firefox will continue to receive
security patches on both XP and
Vista until next summer so there’s
no need to panic – you’ve waited this
long to upgrade so take the time to
back up your machine before you make
the switch.
What do we think?
Welcome back, Mozilla – your timing
couldn’t be better. The open-source
developer has explored other projects
over the past few years, such as a foray
into mobile operating systems, and
while those attempts to take on tech
giants certainly had some strong points,
we’re glad to see Mozilla focusing again
on Firefox.
Chrome is still a solid browser and
Microsoft’s Edge has plenty to
recommend it, but there’s also good
reason to switch your browsing away
from the US tech giants to a firm that
doesn’t collect as much of your private
data and isn’t apparently hell-bent on
dominating our lives. For the past few
years, switching to Firefox meant using
a less capable browser but if Quantum
is all it’s promised to be, we may no
longer need to trade our privacy for
a smooth browsing experience.
That may not be a good enough
reason for you to switch from Chrome
or Edge to Firefox, but more
competition in the browser market
is good news for all of us. We’re
delighted to have you back, Mozilla!

What we think of this fortnight’s top tech news stories and rumours,
and how they affect you

Need to Know
What happened?
The massive data breach at
Yahoo in 2013 was the
biggest recorded hack in
history – and it turns out to
have been much worse
than realised.
Reports last year
suggested that as many as
a billion accounts were
compromised by the hack,
but Yahoo has now
admitted that every single
one of its three billion users
was affected by the
breach. Yahoo took action
to protect all accounts,
directly notifying users
who were identified at the
time as being hacked,
forcing password changes
and invalidating
unencrypted security
questions and answers,
to ensure they couldn’t be
used to access an account.
How will it affect you?
If you held a Yahoo
account back in 2013, your
details were definitely
leaked. You may not have
used Yahoo’s webmail
service, but other sites
owned by the company,
such as Flickr, also require
a Yahoo login.
The leaked data does not
Every Yahoo account
affected by breach
include payment cards or
bank account data, or
passwords in clear text –
any passwords leaked
would be encrypted or
hashed, so it would require
substantial effort from
hackers to view them. That
said, you should update
your Yahoo password and
change it on any other sites
you may have reused it on.
What do we think?
If you’re still using Yahoo,
it may be time to switch to
a new email service. It’s
taken four years for Yahoo
to realise and accept that
its entire system was
hacked, and this isn’t the
only major security
incident faced by the
company – a 2014 breach
leaked details of 500
million users. Yahoo is
clearly struggling to keep
users safe.
No online service is
perfect but we all deserve
better than this. It’s time to
back up your emails to
your PC, save your contact
details, move to a safer
provider and, once you’re
satisfied everyone has your
new address, pull the plug
on Yahoo.
What happened?
Regulator Ofcom is once
again cracking down on
misleading broadband
advertising, in an attempt
to ensure customers have a
better sense of the speeds
they’re likely to receive
with a new provider.
To help simplify
broadband contracts, the
regulator has updated its
existing codes of practice,
which apply to any ISP that
has signed up to Ofcom’s
voluntary set of rules.
Alongside existing rules
that ask companies to give
customers a range of the
estimated speeds they’re
likely to get, and the right
to end a contract without
penalty, Ofcom is asking
ISPs to share figures on
peak-time speeds, which
are often slower than
average speeds.
How will it affect you?
For most residential users,
peak times are between
8pm and 10pm – probably
when most of us sit down
to watch Netflix or Amazon
Prime. If the speed isn’t
fast enough, you may
struggle to stream reliably.
Ofcom also wants to
make it easier for
customers to leave
Ofcom tells ISPs to
be more honest
a contract if speeds fall
below a set minimum.
At present, providers have
a limited amount of time to
fix the situation before
customers can walk away.
The regulator wants to
extend that provision,
as well as the wider code,
to phone and TV bundles,
rather than just
broadband-only contracts.
What do we think?
These are all welcome
changes, but Ofcom needs
to make sure customers are
aware that they can walk
away from their contracts.
The regulator tests ISPs
using ‘secret shoppers’
to check that they are open
about speed data prior to
signing customers up to
a contract, but Ofcom also
needs to ensure we know
about such changes
partway through our
contracts. There are plenty
of us who don’t realise that
we can move to a better
supplier if we want.
Allowing customers to
switch providers without
penalty will put pressure
on ISPs who aren’t living
up to promises, and ensure
we all have the fastest,
most reliable broadband
we can get.

Google Pixel 2
bit.ly/pixel434
For the most part, the Google Pixel 2
is identical to last year’s Pixel. Not
only is it made by HTC again, but the
design has only been slightly tweaked.
The power button gets a splash of
colour, which makes it a little easier to
spot, and while the phone still has a
glass panel on its rear, it’s now thinner,
freeing the rear-mounted fingerprint
reader from its glassy prison. It comes
in three distinct colours: Kinda Blue,
Just Black and Clearly White.
Sound for video and games is
improved by the dual front-facing
speakers but not everyone will be
pleased by the lack of a headphone
jack which limits you to USB Type-C
headphones or analog headphones
with the included adapter.
battery”, although we didn’t have time
to confirm this in our short test.
On the back, there’s a 12-megapixel
f/1.8 camera powered by Google’s
Imaging Sensor. Google Lens is built
in and lets you search the web and
your photo library using a picture
rather typing a search query. The
camera can also extract information
from images, pulling details such as
phone numbers, emails and
addresses. The Pixel 2’s always-on 5in
display brings up notifications as
usual, but it also has a Now Playing
feature that lets you see what’s
playing in the background.
At first glance, the Google Pixel 2
isn’t remarkably different from its
predecessor. It may have a handful of
new features, but it’s difficult to say
whether they justify the £629 price
tag (or £729 for the 128MB version).
What happened?
Google has ended its controversial
policy of requiring publishers to offer at
least a few articles for free or risk a drop
in their search-results ranking – and has
sweetened the deal by sharing user data
for subscription sign-ups.
First Click Free was a Google policy
that required publishers to offer a set
number of articles for free, or risk losing
their ranking in search results. Two years
ago, to appease publishers who were
concerned that Google was giving away
their work for free, Google allowed
the number of free articles to be limited
to three.
That wasn’t good enough for some:
the Wall Street Journal stopped giving
any stories away for free this year,
leading to a drop in traffic but a boost in
subscribers. Following “months-long
experiments” with the New York Times
and Financial Times, both of which have
paywalls, Google has ditched First Click
Free in favour of a new Flexible
Sampling policy, which lets publishers
decide for themselves the number – if
any – of free stories to offer non-
subscribers. Google recommends that
sites allow 10 free stories each month
before imposing a paywall.
The aim is to encourage readers to
sign up for subscriptions, suggesting
paywalls have beaten out free news,
at least for the bigger newspapers.
Google stops letting users peek behind paywalls
To make subscriptions easier, Google
will share user data with publishers and
eventually help news sites offer deals to
regular readers.
How will it affect you?
If you regularly visit a site that has a
paywall, just to read the allowed number
of free articles per month or per week,
you may find that things are about to
change. This could either be for the
better, with more stories available to
view for free; or (more likely) for the
worse, with a paywall now completely
blocking your access. You may even find
that, because Google is now sharing
user data with publishers, you get
offered a special discount or free trial
on a subscription to the site.
What do we think?
We’re not big fans of paywalls, but we
realise that websites have to earn
money somehow, and page-view
restrictions are an acceptable
alternative to adverts. Google’s Flexible
Sampling policy certainly seems fairer
to publishers, but we hope it doesn’t
result in more sites erecting paywalls
or targeting them at specific users
based on data provided by Google.
We’d be devastated if Wikipedia or
BBC News started limiting us to a few
articles a day.
Inside the Pixel 2, you’ll find an
octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor and 4GB of memory. The
phone comes with either 64 or 128GB of
storage but has no microSD slot. Google
claims the Pixel 2 has an “all-day

The death knell is tolling
for Microsoft’s Surface
range if predictions from
technology analyst Canalys
are to be believed. Canalys
said that Microsoft’s CEO,
Satya Nadella, is a
“software guy, a cloud
guy”, which means the
company’s tablet and
laptop range is likely to
go the same way as its
Windows Phone division.
But Nadella’s preference
for software over hardware isn’t the
only reason for predictions of demise
for Surface. Despite being highly rated
by many reviewers, Microsoft has
struggled to make money from Surface,
and earlier this year the high-end
tablets and laptops were branded
“unreliable” by a consumer watchdog.
Canalys believes the Surface range
will be “the first target” in an inevitable
cost-cutting drive, and its predictions
were backed up by hardware
manufacturer Lenovo. “Microsoft is
making a lot of money on cloud, making
a lot of money on Windows and Office,
but losing a lot of money on devices,”
said Lenovo’s corporate president and
chief operating officer, Gianfranco
Lanci. “Frankly speaking, it is difficult to
see why they should keep losing money.
For them it is a very difficult exercise to
run hardware products business, they
need to be careful about every single

detail as the margin on this is so thin.”
Over the last three months, revenue
from Surface devices has apparently
decreased by $20m (around £15m).
As for when the Surface line is likely
to meet its end, Lanci suggested 2019
at the latest.
WEBOMETER
LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
Microsoft’s Surface laptops and
tablets are beautifully designed
pieces of hardware, but they’re
also very pricey, so we’re not
surprised they haven’t proved as
popular as hoped. With Windows
Phone now ditched, we wouldn’t
be surprised if Surface goes the
same way, although it’s possible
Microsoft may halt its decline by
offering cheaper models.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
David Emm, principal
security researcher
at Kaspersky Lab
(www.kaspersky.co.uk)
Q
Is ransomware
a bigger threat
than ever?
Peter H Griffiths, Twitter
A
Undoubtedly.
Ransomware
incidents have
soared since 2012, with
criminals lured by the
promise of profit and ease
of implementation.
Apple Macs at risk from
bootup bug
Although Macs are
widely regarded as
much more secure
than Windows, Duo
Labs has revealed
that up to 4.2% of
them could be vulnerable to a boot-
up bug caused by outdated software.
The security firm analysed 73,000
‘real-world’ Macs and all updates to
the operating system over the last
three years to get an idea of how
many ‘extensible firmware interface’
(EFI) updates – which are used to
pre-boot Macs – had been released.
It discovered that the EFI had not
been updated in many Macs it tested
and although some computers had
the most recent security patches
installed, the pre-boot environment
had never been updated, leaving it
vulnerable to exploits.
The news is yet another blow to
The threat has become
stealthier and more
destructive, increasingly
targeting businesses rather
than individuals, where the
potential returns are higher.
Last year, the No More
Ransom Initiative (www
.nomoreransom.org) was
launched by the National Hi
Tech Crime Unit of the Dutch
Police, Europol, McAfee and
Kaspersky Lab. Its tools have
rescued data on more than
28,000 devices and deprived
cybercriminals of an
estimated £6.5m in ransoms.
Follow these guidelines
to protect your PC from
ransomware:
• Back up data regularly.
• Use reliable security
software and keep key
proactive detection features
– such as Kaspersky Lab’s
System Watcher – turned on.
• Always keep software
updated on all your devices.
• Adopt good ‘housekeeping’
practices to limit the ability
of ransomware to spread and
impact data. These include
segmenting the network;
not automatically assigning
admin rights to staff; and
restricting write access
to data.
If you’re unlucky enough
to fall victim to
ransomware, don’t panic:
• Use a clean system to
check the No More Ransom
site, where you may find a
decryption tool that helps
you get your files back.
• Be very wary about
paying the ransom. It’s no
guarantee that you’ll get
your data back; and every
payment cybercriminals
receive validates their
business model.
• Last, but not least,
remember that ransomware
is a criminal offence.
Report it to your local
law-enforcement agency.

Apple security. Last month, US security

Equifax breach worse than
thought
Equifax has admitted that a further 2.5
million of its customers may have been
affected by the massive data breach
disclosed last month, taking the total up
to 145.5 million. The investigation into
how 400,000 Equifax customers in the
UK have been affected by the breach has
been completed and the information
is now being analysed by the firm.
Equifax’s systems were reportedly
vulnerable since March, but hackers
didn’t take advantage of the flaws until
May. “The vulnerability remained in an
Equifax web application much longer
than it should have,” said former
Equifax CEO Richard Smith. “It was
this unpatched vulnerability that
allowed hackers to access personal
identifying information.”
Security personnel noticed
suspicious activity on 29 July and
ended the hacking on 30 July by
disabling the web application. Smith
said he was alerted the day after but
did not realise the extent of the stolen
data. Equifax said there is no evidence
the attackers accessed databases
located outside the US.

Digital Panopticon
www.digitalpanopticon.org
If you’re tracing your family tree or
are just curious about the past, this
fascinating site lets you browse the
records of convicts in British prisons and
those transported to the Australian penal
colonies. Using tens of thousands of
court records from the 18th and 19th
centuries, it lets you search for names,
offences, sentences and places as well
as criteria as in-depth as eye colour,
complexion and religion. Click a result to
see the crime they were tried for, and the
date of their conviction and sentence.
You can also display results visually and
download data sets. It’s a unique
resource that proves truly enlightening.
Energy Switching
www.energyswitching.co.uk
Energy prices are on the rise so now is
the perfect time to consider switching.
This site, like several others, compares
your current energy deal with market
rivals, but what makes it stand out is its
simple form that asks for little more than
your current supplier and tariff, usage
requirements and payment method.
We like that the clearly laid-out results
include useful info such as supplier exit
fees. With highlighted savings, the ability
to proceed online or by phone and
a button for more information about
tariffs, it’s certainly a site to bookmark
for the discerning consumer.

Having taken over the franchise once
operated by South West Trains, South
Western Railway has steamed ahead
with this new site. Neatly designed and
easily navigable, it puts ticket purchasing
at its heart, although its clumsy ordering
system has your eyes flitting back and

a Be Inspired button suggesting

you get a solid feel of what to expect
when you visit in person, thanks to large,
clear photos, videos of some of the

as opening times, prices and directions.
We love that the café section includes

Created by Scotland’s national telehealth

outlining the services it has to offer.
It introduces you to the 111 service and
grants you access to the National Service

The Department for Education has
accused this site of publishing
“misleading analysis” but, nevertheless,
School Cuts is an intriguing resource for
anyone concerned about education.
Backed by a host of unions, it lets you
search by school, postcode or place to
see how much money is being lost, both
in total and per pupil. You can also
discover how many teachers a school has
lost and read some key facts. All the
information is sharable on Facebook and

that lets you discover if you can get fibre broadband in you area. This lists all the ISPs
that offer the service as well as details about your exchange. You can also learn more
about the different types of broadband and check your line for network problems,

eye-catching imagery to showcase the
latest trends. It also pulls photos from its
Instagram feed and has a speedy search
engine that makes light work of finding
what you’re after. We were pleased to
see a wide range of Buyer’s Guides and

leading designers, many of whom
helpfully recommend specific companies
and products for you to seek out.

Q
My webhost wants to charge
more to make my site secure
(HTTPS). Is it worth it?
Matt van der Willik, via email
A
Sites secured via HTTPS need an
SSL certificate that secures the
connection by encrypting data
between the browser and the web server.
If your site transmits any kind of sensitive or
personal information, such as passwords,
email addresses, credit cards and the like,
then an SSL Certificate is expected.
Prices for SSL vary according to the level
of validation that’s required. Many web-
hosting providers, including My Hosting
Bubble, now offer free certificates using
‘Let’s Encrypt SSL’. This only offers domain-
level validation but that’s often more than
sufficient for the majority of sites.

Watch Stranger Things
Season 2
From 27 October
When Stranger Things appeared on Netflix last July, few
people predicted how popular the retro sci-fi-horror series
would prove with viewers and critics alike, and Season 2
could be one of the streaming giant’s biggest successes yet.
Set in the Eighties, in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana,
the first season focused on the disappearance of a young
boy amid paranormal events and the efforts of his friends –
and a psychokinetic girl called Eleven – to find him.
The second season is set a year after the first and involves
the characters trying to return to normal while also
“exploring the bigger mythology”. Winona Ryder returns
as Joyce Byers, the missing boy’s mother, but the producers
have been tight-lipped about what else to expect, aside
from saying “it gets pretty crazy toward the end”.
Every episode of Season 2 debuts on Netflix on
27 October – just in time for a Halloween binge-watch –
and you’ll be able to read reviews on our sister site,
Den of Geek (www.denofgeek.com).

22 18 - 31 October 2017
T
he arrival of the latest
iPhones has been met
with the customary
fanfare and fuss, and we’ve
had our hands on one of the
first to launch – the new
iPhone 8 Plus. We’ve not yet
had a chance to review the
£999 iPhone X (which isn’t
available until November) or
the £699 iPhone 8, but we
suspect that this model hits
the sweet spot between
price and features.
The cheapest 8 Plus is £799
(so not cheap at all) and
comes with 64GB of storage.
The 256GB version will set
you back £949.
Design
On the face of it, the iPhone 8
Plus and iPhone 7 Plus are
virtually indistinguishable:
all the external components
are in precisely the same
locations, both are dust- and
water-resistant and both have
a Force Touch fingerprint-
sensor Home button and
Apple iPhone 8 Plus
(unfortunately) no 3.5mm
headphone socket.
Flip the phone over, though,
and there are some obvious
differences. The back of the 8
Plus is all glass, flat across
most of its glossy surface with
a slight upward curve at the
edges and no sharp chamfer
to dig into your palm. It’s too
early to say how robust or
scratch- and shatter-resistant
it is, but we’d recommend
buying a case.
The phone can be charged
wirelessly (it conforms to the
Qi standard) but the extra
glass makes it noticeably
heavier than the 7 Plus,
weighing 205g – that’s 17g
more than its predecessor.
Display
The iPhone 8 Plus’s 5.5in IPS
display improves slightly on
the iPhone 7 Plus’s in our
tests. Peak brightness reaches
553cd/m2 (candles per square
metre) with a full white screen
in the browser, 1,365:1 contrast
look away from the screen
and back again, resulting in
more natural-looking images
and less eyestrain.
Performance and
battery life
The iPhone 8 Plus has seen
significant improvement in its
performance. The new
hexa-core A11 Bionic chip is so
good that it batters not only
its predecessor but also the
Samsung Galaxy S8 and all its
Android flagship buddies into
submission – see our
benchmark results chart, left.

not wildly impressive. That’s

Apple iPhone 8 Plus Product Test
We haven’t yet reviewed the
£999 iPhone X but we’ll
hazard a guess that of the
three new iPhone models,
the iPhone 8 Plus represents
the best value for money.
However, that doesn’t make
it the best phone available
for the price.
The Samsung Galaxy S8’s
performance may not be as
fast as the iPhone 8 Plus’s
but it’s not far off, and it’s
cheaper and has a better
screen. It doesn’t have dual
cameras but its single
camera is at least as good
as the iPhone 8 Plus’s main
camera, its battery life is
longer and it has microSD
card expansion to add
storage space. We also
think the Galaxy S8 looks
nicer, too.
However, the iPhone 8
Plus is still one of the best
phones Apple has ever
produced, and for Apple
diehards, it offers the best
value of the new range.
Samsung Galaxy S8,
£544.95

taken advantage of the extra
efficiency of the A11 chip to
reduce the size of the battery.
It’s now a 2,675mAh (milliamp
Hour) unit, which is smaller
than the iPhone 7 Plus’s
2,900mAh unit.
Here, the iPhone 8 Plus’s
rivals have a clear upper hand.
In our video-rundown battery
test, which we run at a set
screen brightness of 170cd/m2
with the phone in flight mode
to ensure a level playing field,
the iPhone 8 Plus lasted 13h
54mins before giving up.
That’s a long way behind the
Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and
OnePlus 5, which both last
well beyond 20 hours.
Wireless charging is an
added convenience, though,
especially because it’s
compatible with lots of
chargers, including Ikea’s Selje
nightstands and Varv lamps.
Cameras
A pair of 12-megapixel
cameras adorn the back of
the phone: one 28mm, the
other a 2x telephoto 56mm
lens – very similar to the
iPhone 7 Plus’s. The main
difference is that the
telephoto camera is now
optically stabilised, so it
performs better in low light.
HDR (high dynamic range)
is now enabled permanently
and there’s an enhanced
Portrait mode, which lets you
apply lighting effects to
portrait photos that have
blurred backgrounds. This
works very well, giving you
the option to change the look
of your portraits both before
and after you’ve taken them.
Video quality is remarkably
good, too. You can capture in
4K at up to 60fps (frames per
second) and the stabilisation
is superb, working as well on
the telephoto lens as it does
the regular one.
The front-facing camera is a
7-megapixel unit no different
to the iPhone 7 Plus’s. It takes
highly detailed selfies and,
although there’s no front-
facing flash, the screen can be
used to flood your face with
light, which improves shots
taken indoors.

iPhone X, £999
To get the latest
innovation from
Apple, you’ll have
to fork out nearly
£1,000. It’s a
beauty, though,
with a screen that
occupies most of
the device and a
range of new
technologies. As
Apple’s cutting-
edge device, it’s the most
future-proof of all its
phones.
iPhone Options
There’s now a bewildering selection of iPhones to choose from, including new
and old models. Here’s our guide to what’s available
iPhone 8, £699
The iPhone 8 is not only
considerably cheaper
than the iPhone X, it’s
also smaller, so it fits
more comfortably in your
pocket. However, it lacks
the Plus model’s brilliant
dual camera and it’s still
pricey when compared
to many similar-sized
Android phones.
Older models
You can still get your hands
on the iPhone 7 (£549),
iPhone 7 Plus (£669),
iPhone 6 (£449) and iPhone
6 Plus (£549). Their design
is the same as the iPhone 8
so the cheaper price
essentially equates to a
reduction in performance,
and Apple will be ending
support for them sooner.
If you prefer a smaller
device, you can still get the
brilliant iPhone SE (£349),
which has the same
performance as the iPhone
6 but in the discontinued
iPhone 5S’s case.

If you’ve ever bought
movies on iTunes, the
Apple TV 4K is a tempting
prospect because your
existing purchases will
automatically be upgraded
to the higher resolution.
However, the device’s UK

Jonathan Bray tests Apple’s latest streaming device,
which lets you watch 4K content on your TV
if the selection of apps
doesn’t cover your favourite
service, you may still be able
to stream it to your TV from
another device, but while All
4 can be streamed in this way,
both ITV Hub and Demand 5
are blocked.
a huge bonus.
The device itself is the same
size and shape as the
previous year’s model –
its sleek black lines only
interrupted by the power,
Gigabit Ethernet and HDMI
ports. The box provides
dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and
comes with either 32GB
or 64GB storage, which is
designed to be used for apps
rather than movies.
The Siri remote hasn’t
changed much, either. Its six
buttons provide quick access
to core functions such as Siri
voice commands, volume and
play/pause, with a clickable,
swipeable touchpad.
Set up and apps
The device is simple to set up
and use. It works out what
resolution it needs to provide
by checking with your TV and,
if you have an iPhone nearby,
it will grab your Wi-Fi
password and sync any iTunes
purchases. With a few more
clicks, it’ll show off your
iCloud photos, too.
You can use the buttons on
the remote to browse, but it’s
even easier to use Siri’s voice
search tool, which works from
the homepage across multiple
services, or within individual
apps where you can dictate
keywords directly into the
search field.
Our main disappointment
with Apple TV is the limited
range of available apps. This
is improving, but Netflix and
recent addition Amazon
Video are still the only 4K
options, and its UK catch-up
services are very restricted,
with no built-in All 4, Demand
5 or ITV Hub apps.
You can use AirPlay for
music and video, so even
Unfortunately, we found the
resolution and quality of All 4
through AirPlay was low, and
it’s irritating that, having
spent this much on a
streamer, you can’t use it to
stream, for example, The
Great British Bake Off in HD.
A
4K TV (with a
maximum resolution
of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels)
can cost as little as a few
hundred pounds these days,
so if you’re looking for a new
streamer, it makes sense to
buy a 4K device which will
be ready for action and
compatible when you next
upgrade your TV set.
The latest Apple TV device,
announced at the same time
as the new iPhones (see page
22) has been upgraded to 4K.
However, it’s not just the
hardware that’s been given
a boost – 4K movies have
now been introduced to the
iTunes store and Apple has
pledged to keep 4K content
at the same price as HD, while
converting existing iTunes
purchases to 4K for free.
If you’ve paid for any video
content on iTunes, this is

As you are no doubt aware, ransomware is one
of the nastiest forms of malware around.
It hijacks your system, encrypts your personal

way to get your data back, but you’ll need
to know the name of the ransomware you’ve
been hit by. This is where Bitdefender’s free

Control Chrome using
quick commands
There are lots of keyboard shortcuts
that work with Chrome, but aside from
the most common – Ctrl+C, Ctrl+F,
Ctrl+Shift+T – the majority are easily
overlooked. A new Chrome extension
called Cato (bit.ly/cato434), which has
nothing to do with the Pink Panther’s
manservant, provides a simple
alternative to shortcuts and a relief from
endless mouse clicking. It lets you
perform dozens of everyday tasks by
clicking its toolbar button and typing
a letter that appears in the desired
command. For example, type c and
you’ll be given one-click options to copy
the URL of the current page, change the
tab you’re viewing, show all available
commands and more. Cato is quick and
It’s impossible to go on the web without someone or something trying to track you
– usually advertising servers and analytics tools. Most of these trackers are harmless
but they still invade your privacy, so it’s useful to know which websites are the worst
for spying on your online activities. Step forward uBO-Scope (bit.ly/uboscope434),
which measures your ‘privacy exposure’ on every site you visit. This is presented as
a score showing the number of third-party connections that could potentially track
you. Click a cell in the toolbar panel to see the name of the tracker and its
prevalence across other sites you’ve
visited today – for example, Google
Analytics appeared on 67% of sites.
If you’re using a reliable content
blocker, such as uBlock Origin (from the
same developer), you should have a low
exposure score. Try turning it off to
reveal the full horror of hidden trackers
on the current page. The uBO-Scope
add-on is also available for Firefox
(bit.ly/ubofire434).
Block online adverts
using flowers
One drawback to using an ad
blocker (other than depriving
content creators of essential
revenue) is that it leaves gaps in
websites, and makes them look bare.
Green Gallery Green Screen
(bit.ly/green434) solves this
problem by replacing banner ads
with sumptuous pictures of flowers
or, to be more precise, floral art
“designed by world-famous
creatives”. The images include
rugged roses from tattooist Henk
Schiffmacher and “avant-garde 3D
flowers” from design label Pigalle.
As with other ad blockers, you can
whitelist sites on which to disable
the add-on or turn it off altogether.

Forcibly turn off subtitles
on Netflix
If you use a VPN to watch Netflix films
and TV shows outside the UK (which is
naughty, but let’s not be naïve), you may
find your view obscured by subtitles
that can’t be turned off in the usual
manner. This often happens in regions
where the first language isn’t English
and you’re forced to watch content with
text on the screen. Unsubtitle for Netflix
(bit.ly/unsubtitle434), as you can guess
from its name, lets you turn off the
unwanted closed captions simply by
clicking its toolbar button. Naturally, it
won’t work when the subtitles are part
of the actual show or movie!

Restore the old Options page
in Firefox 56
In last issue’s ‘Stop using Firefox’ feature,
we had a bit of a moan about Mozilla’s
“if it ain’t broke, let’s fix it anyway”
attitude to its browser, and if you’ve
poked around the latest version (56),
you’ll have spotted a prime example in
the form of the redesigned Options page
(also known as ‘about:preferences’).
Formerly organised into eight sections,
there are now only four: General, Search,
Privacy & Security and Firefox Account.
Fortunately, for those of you desperately
scrolling around to find specific settings
in the new streamlined layout, there is a workaround that restores the former
design, at least until you’re ready to embrace the future (ahem). Type
about:config into the address bar, press Enter and agree to the warning.
Search for the preference ‘browser.preferences.useOldOrganization’, double-click
it to change its value to ‘true’ and the Options page will revert to its old design.
Changing the value to ‘false’ will slim it down again to its new look.
Find replacements for
outdated add-ons
Also in our last issue, we warned that on
14 November, when Firefox 57 is
released, you won’t be able to use many
of your favourite add-ons unless they’ve
been upgraded to WebExtensions. To
address this problem, Mozilla has added
the option to find replacements for your
‘legacy’ add-ons that work in the
updated browser. Open the Add-ons
Manager in Firefox 57 and click ‘Show
legacy extensions’ to see a list of
‘deactivated’ add-ons that are no longer
supported, accompanied (where
possible) by ‘Find a Replacement’
buttons. Click this to open a collection
of similar tools, which you can sort by
name, popularity or the date the add-on
was upgraded to a WebExtension. These
can be installed in the usual manner.
We looked for an alternative to McAfee
WebAdvisor and were recommended
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger and
– rather bafflingly – Emoji Cheatsheet.

either by

pressing Space or by right-
clicking highlighted text on a
page and choosing ‘Search
StartPage for…’. You can turn
search suggestions on or off in
the add-on’s options and block
results from specific search
engines including Bing, Yahoo
and Yandex.

SECURITY
Avast Security
www.avast.com/android
(varies)
The Android app variously
known as Avast Mobile
Security (on Avast’s
website), Avast Antivirus
& Security (on the Google
Play Store) and Avast
Security (on its own home
screen) has brought in
a brace of new features –
but only one, Photo Vault,
is free(ish).
Photo Vault lets you
protect your sensitive
photos by encrypting
them with a PIN. It’s
fairly easy to set up (see our Mini Workshop, right), but it’s
not perfect. Encrypted photos remain visible in cloud-
based backup apps such as Google Photos, and the free
version of Avast Security only lets you lock 10 photos.
For unlimited encryption, you’ll need to fork out £1.89 per
month (or £7.49 per year) via an in-app purchase.
The two other big new features, App Locking and Power
Save, are both for paying subscribers only – though you do
get a free 14-day trial.
With Avast’s latest research revealing that Android
phones and tablets were targeted by 1.7 million attacks per
month in the second quarter of 2017 – up 40% on 2016
(bit.ly/avstats434) – we’re
pleased to note that the app’s
malware-scanning functions
have been improved without
being locked behind a paywall.
The main Scan button
checks your devices for
intruders such as rootkits and
fake apps, while the Scan
Wi-Fi button checks your
router. There’s also a free
Boost RAM tool for killing
background processes; and a
Clean Junk tool to round up
‘unnecessary files’.
The adverts and upgrade
prompts are annoying, and
the notifications that plague
your home
screen are positively infuriating. But that’s par
for the course from a free antivirus app and
Avast Security is less of a drain on your battery
and system resources than many of its rivals.

How on Earth did that dog just send you a message?! It must be the
Physical Web. David Crookes explains Google’s latest wheeze
The Physical Web
What is the Physical Web?
The Physical Web (bit.ly/physical434)
was created by the team behind Google
Chrome to let you interact with real-life
objects and locations using nothing more
than the browser on your phone. The
idea is that you receive information
simply by walking past an object that’s
broadcasting a URL, including
notifications, directions and location-
specific advice, putting potentially useful
content at your fingertips when you’re
out and about.
How does it work?
For an item to broadcast a URL, it needs
to be fitted with a small beacon – more
specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy
radio, which beams a short-range signal
that your phone can recognise. Provided
you’ve activated the Physical Web on
your device by turning on Bluetooth,
you’ll be notified that the beacon wishes
to communicate. You’ll then be directed
to a web page where you can interact
with the object or location – without
having to download an app.
Can you give me any examples?
Yes. Imagine you’re standing outside
a cake shop. A beacon can send a signal
to your device directing you to a page
containing a half-price discount voucher.
Likewise, a parking meter could send
a URL to your phone that lets you enter
your payment details online. If you’re
viewing a poster advertising a band
you like, a beacon could point you
in the direction of the tour dates.
Similarly, a movie poster could direct
you to local cinema times.
Google even suggests that tiny
beacons could be fitted on pets: should
your dog get lost, you can make the
beacon broadcast a URL that tells
passers-by where the pooch is from
so they can guide it safely home.
How is it currently being used?
As well as being used in museums for
audio guides, the Physical Web is making
its mark on transport. The MyStop
project (mystop.proxama.com), for
example, delivers notifications to
passengers by placing beacons at the
front of buses. When passengers open
the notification, they can view up-to-date
travel information.
And there’s plenty of fun to be had,
too. As we explained in last issue’s
What’s New Online, when you visit the
Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, you can
interact with a host of resident creatures
(talesofthepark.com). Get close to one
and a notification directs you to a web
link, so you can chat.
Isn’t this just the Internet of
Things?
Yes and no. The Physical Web builds on
the Internet of Things, adding another
layer. In that sense, it’s comparable to the
relationship between the internet and
the world wide web: the internet is the
infrastructure and the web is the method

The Physical Web
18 - 31 October 2017 39
we use to interact with it. Here, the
Internet of Things is the underlying
infrastructure and the Physical Web is
the friendly face. The aim is to make the
latter the ‘search engine of the world’.
Why does it use old-fashioned
URLs?
Google says URLs let any developer use
the Physical Web because they are
“decentralised” and not wrapped up in
a specific ecosystem. This ensures the
Physical Web is kept open, making it
more attractive to developers and
manufacturers. Indeed, everything from
the beacons to the scanners to the
proxies used to filter URLs is open,
and it will always remain that way.
So has Google set the standard?
To a large degree, yes. The Physical Web
uses the open-beacon format, Eddystone
(bit.ly/eddy434), which has been adopted
by a number of beacon manufacturers
including Kontakt.io and Onyx. The
system limits URLs to 17 characters due
to the packet-size restrictions of
Bluetooth, but developers can get round
this by using URL shorteners. Eddystone
is certainly more flexible than Apple’s
rival system, iBeacon (bit.ly/ibeacon434),
which only works with iOS devices, and is
app-based rather than web-based.
Will the Physical Web drain my
battery?
That’s feasible, but Google is fully aware
of such concerns. As such, it has taken
steps to lessen the impact by only having
your phone scan for nearby beacons
when its screen is on. Google also says
we needn’t worry about the beacons
running out of juice any time soon. Since
the Physical Web uses Bluetooth, which
is very energy efficient, the beacons can
last for many years, even though they
broadcast about three times a second.
Does it work on both iOS and
Android?
Yes, the Physical Web can be used on
both. If you’re running Android KitKat
(4.4) or above, you just need to have
Bluetooth and Location turned on.
You’ll also be able to receive
Nearby Notifications alerting
you to available URLs. To
activate the option in Chrome
for Android, go to Settings,
Advanced, Privacy and set
‘Physical web’ to On.
If you’re using iOS, you’ll
need to have Chrome installed,
then turn on Bluetooth, add the
Chrome widget and opt into
the Physical Web.
You can see a full set of
illustrated instructions for both
mobile operating systems
at bit.ly/mobile434.
How secure is the Physical Web?
That’s a very good question. The main
security concern is that you could be
spammed or directed to a malicious URL
when you walk past a beacon. It is also
possible that you may tap through to
a spoof address and end up entering
personal information such as bank details.
Someone up to no good could even place
an illegal beacon next to a legitimate one,
making it difficult to figure out which is
the correct one. These are issues that
need to be tackled should the Physical
Web take off, as it is expected to do.
Isn’t Google addressing these
concerns?
It is. Google says it has implemented
several security measures, including
always broadcasting URLs over secure
HTTPS connections. It also uses a proxy
service that can filter malicious URLs and
give lower priority to less useful web
addresses. We should also point out that
you don’t interact with the beacon itself:
the beacon simply broadcasts the URL
and everything after that is conducted
via Wi-Fi or your mobile connection, from
which point you should exercise the same
caution as you would with any web
communication.
Some beacon manufacturers are
working on improving security. Fathom
(www.fathomsys.com), for example, has
added a layer of security that can detect
unexpected beacons close by. We’d be
very surprised if we didn’t see stories
about Physical Web security breaches
in the future, though.
You don’t need to buy a beacon to
broadcast URLs via the Physical Web.
It is possible to send links using
Windows, MacOS and Linux, although
it requires some tinkering and
technical know-how.
The easiest method is to use an
Android app called Beacon Toy (bit.ly/
toy434), which lets you broadcast
Physical Web URLs from your phone.
To do this, launch the app, click the
blue ‘+’ button and select Eddystone-
URL. Enter the web address you want
to broadcast, select the broadcasting
interval and transmit power
(or leave these settings
as the defaults), then tap
the tick icon.
Your Eddystone beacon
will then broadcast the URL
to anyone who has the
Physical Web enabled and
walks past you – or gets
within a range of up to
100m, depending on the
power you select.

features, such as video calling and
WhatsApp Web, and offer tips on
how to beat its biggest annoyances –
by silencing incessant group chats,
blocking spam and decluttering the
homepage. We’ve also included
a range of hacks to help you find
and share everything faster.
Finally, we offer tips on security and
privacy, and tackle all your burning
questions about the service such as
whether it’s genuinely secure and if
you’ll ever have to pay to use it.

FEATURE
18 - 31 October 2017 41
WhatsApp lets you choose which details
you want to share for each person.
Edit photos before you send them
Sharing photos and screenshots is
simple enough, but sometimes you
might want to crop an image before
you send it. WhatsApp lets you do this
without having to install additional
photo-editing apps. Just tap the
paperclip icon, select Gallery and
choose the photo you want to send.
Next, tap the crop icon and drag the
markers to highlight your selection.
Tap Done and swipe up to add filters,
stickers and text, or to draw on the
image. There’s an Undo button to
remove the changes if you’re not happy
with the results.
Quote old messages in a chat
Sometimes it takes a while to respond
to messages, by which time a group
conversation may have drifted to
a totally different subject. In these
cases, you can quote the exact message
SHARE EVERYTHING FASTER
you’re responding to by long-pressing
it and then tapping left arrow on the
toolbar. The quoted message appears in
a pop-up window so you can compose
your response below it. When you tap
the Send button, your message appears
directly below the quote and the name
of the user, so there’s no ambiguity
about who you’re responding to.
Share your location with other
people
If you’ve ever tried meeting someone
in an unfamiliar place, you’ll know how
difficult it can be to explain where you
are using a vague description of your
surroundings. Thanks to WhatsApp’s
location-sharing feature, you’ll never
need to do this again. To share your
location in a chat, tap the paperclip icon
and select Location. Approve any
permissions that the app asks for, then
tap ‘Send your current location’. When
the recipient receives your location,
they can tap it to launch Google Maps
and get directions to find you.
See our Mini Workshop below to find
out how to use this feature.
Send any file (including hi-res
images)
In the past, WhatsApp only let you send
PDFs and media files, but you can now
send any file type, which makes it
a great alternative to sending
attachments in emails. To send a file,
tap the paperclip
icon in the chat
and choose
Documents.
A list appears
of documents
on your device,
which you can
sort by name or
date. Pick the file
you want to send
and it’ll appear
in the chat for
your recipient
to download.
To send an
image at full
resolution, pick
‘Browse other
docs’ to browse
all the files on
your device.
Share multiple contact details
When you want to share contact details
with a friend, there’s no need to send
a business card from your Contacts app.
Just tap the paperclip icon in a chat,
select Contact and you can choose one
or more contacts to share with the
recipient. Tap the right arrow and

Pin important WhatsApp chats
If you find that important conversations
are often pushed down the screen by
unimportant
group chats,
you can pin your
favourite
conversations
so they’re
always easy to
find. To do this,
long-press the
chat you want
to keep near the
top and tap the
pin icon. To
unpin a chat,
long-press it again and select the pin
icon with a strike through it.
Bookmark important messages
When someone sends you information
such as an address or telephone
number, scrolling through reams
of messages to find it again can be
annoying. To avoid this, bookmark
the message by long-pressing it and
tapping the star icon. When you need
it again, select ‘Starred messages’
from the main menu to view all your
bookmarked messages.
Find every link you’ve ever shared
If you’re looking for a link in a message
that you didn’t star, use the following
trick. Go to the appropriate chat and tap
the three-dot button. Select Media, then
Links to scroll through a chronological
list of all the links shared between you
and that contact. You’ll also see tabs for
Media and Documents, which make it
easier to find files you’ve shared with
that contact.
Add chat shortcuts to your home
screen
You can add a home-screen shortcut
to your favourite chats, for quick access.
Open the chat you want to add a
shortcut for, tap the menu button, then
select More and ‘Add shortcut’. An icon
appears on your home screen, which
you can move to a chosen position.

Change your wallpaper
WhatsApp lets you change the
wallpaper displayed
behind your chats.
Just open the menu
within a chat, tap
Wallpaper and pick
an image from your
Gallery or WhatsApp’s
Wallpaper Library.
If you’d prefer
something plainer,
try the Solid Colour
or No Wallpaper
options. Note that
changing the
wallpaper only affects
your own chats and
not your recipients’.
Make your messages stand out
To add more impact to a message,
why not format it in bold? To do this,
simply surround the words you want to
appear in bold with asterisk (*) symbols.
You can also surround a word (or words)
with underscore (_) symbols to convert
it to italics; or with tilde (~) symbols
to add a strikethrough.
Assign notification tones
to groups
You can set custom notification tones
for your group chats, so you instantly
know if you’ve received a message from
a particular set of friends – without
needing to look at your phone. Open
a group chat, tap the menu button and
choose ‘Group info’, then tap ‘Custom
notifications’ and tick the box to ‘Use
custom notifications’. You can then pick
from a range of notification tones;
choose whether your phone vibrates
or not; and decide whether it displays
a pop-up notification.
Change the font size
To change the font size in WhatsApp on
an Android device, open its main menu
and tap Settings, then Chats and Font
Size. Here,
you can
choose from
Small,
Medium or
Large text.
On an iPhone,
WhatsApp
uses the
system font
size. To
change this,
open ‘Display & Brightness’ from your
iPhone Settings, then tap Text Size.
You can make the text even larger
by opening Settings, General and
Accessibility, then tapping Large Text.
CUSTOMISE YOUR CHATS
FIND EVERYTHING FASTER
Earlier this year, thousands of WhatsApp users were targeted by a scam
asking them to pay to continue using the service. The trick seemed plausible
because the app only became free to use in 2016 (prior to which you had to
pay a small fee after the first year). Thankfully, there’s no indication that
WhatsApp has any plans to start charging users, so if you ever receive such
a message, simply delete it. There are no plans for it to introduce ads, either.
Instead, WhatsApp is expected to eventually monetise the service by
introducing a dedicated app enabling businesses to communicate with their
customers. This should make it much easier to contact customer services
for banks, airlines and online shops from one place.

STAY SAFE AND ANONYMOUS
It’s a good idea
to use ‘My

most instances,
otherwise
anyone with
your phone
number can see
when you were
last online. It’s
also worth
pointing out that
setting the ‘Last
seen’ option to
‘Nobody’ means
you won’t be able to see when any of
your contacts were last online.
Add two-step verification
Two-step verification adds another layer
of security to your account by asking for
a six-digit PIN to verify your phone
number on WhatsApp, whenever it’s
installed on a new device. To turn it on,
open Settings, then Account and select
‘Two-step verification’. Tap Enable and
enter your PIN, then tap Next and enter
it again to confirm. Tap Next once more
and you’ll be asked to enter an email
address, to which you can send a link
that’ll reset your PIN if you forget it.
Password-protect WhatsApp
WhatsApp has no built-in password
protection for your chats, but you can
add a layer of security on an Android
phone by installing a third-party app
such as AppLock (bit.ly/applock434).
This handy app lets you keep snoopers
at bay by locking apps with a password,
PIN or fingerprint.
You can add another layer of security
by enabling Advanced Protection, which
stops persistent spies from uninstalling
AppLock.
Back up chats and media files
These days, you can back up pretty
much anything on your phone to the
cloud, and WhatsApp chats are no
exception. To set WhatsApp to back up
to Google Drive, open the app’s main
menu and select Settings, Chats and
‘Chat backup’.
Tap ‘Back up to
Google Drive’
to choose how
often the app
saves backups;
or select the
green Back Up
button to back
up immediately.
Select a Google
account and
tap ‘Back up
over’ to specify
whether
WhatsApp
can perform
backups over
‘Wi-Fi or
cellular’ or only
Wi-Fi. If you
want to include
videos in the backup, tick the
appropriate box. When you get a new
phone, you can restore WhatsApp chats
from your Google Drive backups
Stop anyone knowing you’ve read
their messages
If you’d rather people didn’t know when
you’ve read their messages, you can
turn off the option that tells them. From
WhatsApp’s Settings menu, select
Account and Privacy, then untick the
box for ‘Read receipts’. Bear in mind
that if you turn this feature off, you
won’t be able to see when other people
have read your messages either.
Change who can see your private
information
From the Privacy menu in WhatsApp’s
Account Settings, you can also choose
who is allowed to see your personal
information, including your profile
picture, status and when you were last
online. For each option, you can choose
Everyone, ‘My contacts’ or Nobody.
Get alerted when someone
changes device
You can set WhatsApp to alert you if
a chat’s end-to-end encryption key has
changed. This normally indicates that
the recipient has reinstalled WhatsApp
or transferred it
to a new device,
so you can simply
ask them to
confirm that they
know why a new
key has been
issued. To enable
the feature, open
Settings, tap
Account and
Security and
make sure that
‘Show security
notifications’
is turned on.
Stop people reading your
message notifications
If you have an iPhone, you can receive
notifications for new messages without
displaying their content on screen. Just
open the app’s Settings menu, tap
Notifications and toggle the switch for
Preview to off. You’ll now see the name
of the contact in your notifications but
not the message.
On Android phones, there’s no option
to block previews from WhatsApp, but
you can block WhatsApp notifications
altogether by opening Android Settings,
then selecting Apps and WhatsApp.
Toggle ‘Block all’ to On and you’ll never
get caught out by messages appearing
on screen. On some Android devices,
such as our Samsung Galaxy S6, you
might also find options to ‘Show silently’
or similar, which blocks previews but
still displays notifications.

Some messaging apps only
encrypt messages between
you and them, but
WhatsApp’s end-to-end
encryption (which it uses
whenever possible) ensures
that only you and the recipient
of your message can read what is sent. Even your voice calls are encrypted,
and you can easily check if you’re protected by opening the appropriate chat,
tapping its menu button and selecting ‘View contact’. Swipe up and you
should see a padlock with the words ‘Messages to this chat and calls are
secure with end-to-end encryption. Tap to verify.’ When you tap this option,
a unique number appears, which should match that on the recipient’s device.
Don’t worry, this isn’t the actual key – that’s always kept hidden.

option for ‘When roaming’, so you can
ensure that you don’t rack up a large
mobile bill when you’re abroad.
Try turning on the ‘Low data usage’
option to reduce mobile-data usage
during voice calls.
Download images and videos
to your PC
If you want to transfer photos and
videos that you’ve been sent on
WhatsApp to your PC, use WhatsApp
Web (see above) to connect WhatsApp
to your browser, then open a chat, click
the photo or video you want to save and
select the Download button. You can
use the left and right arrows to browse
media that’s been shared previously in
the conversation (including files that
you’ve sent).
Block abusive contacts and spam
If a WhatsApp contact is being a pest
or acting abusively, you can block them
completely. Tap the chat’s menu button,
select More, swipe up and choose Block.
Tap Block when WhatsApp warns you
that you will no longer receive calls or
messages from that person. If you’ve
received a message that appears to be
spam, you can report it by choosing
‘Report and block’.
Clear clutter by archiving old
chats
Like your email inbox, WhatsApp
quickly becomes cluttered if you don’t
keep it tidy. The easiest way to ensure
your messages are organised is to
archive old chats, which removes them
from sight without deleting them. To
archive a chat, long-press it in the Chats
view, then tap the icon that resembles
a down arrow in a folder. Archived chats
reappear in the main view when you
receive a message from that contact, or
you can find them by swiping up to
‘Archived chats’.
Stop WhatsApp using all your
data
WhatsApp doesn’t consume much of
your data allowance if you only use it to
send and receive text messages, but if
you share lots of photos and videos with
your friends, it’ll chew through a
substantial amount. Indeed, WhatsApp
accounted for an impressive 900MB of
mobile-data usage on our phone during
September alone.
To stop this happening, set the app to
Silence annoying group chats
If you’re often distracted by WhatsApp
group chats, try muting them. Open the
offending chat, tap the three-dot button
in the top-right corner and select ‘Mute
notifications’. You can silence the chat
for eight hours, one week or one year,
and untick ‘Show notifications’ to stop
notifications appearing. If you change
your mind, simply select the menu
button again and choose Unmute.
You can also mute conversations with
individuals by opening the appropriate
conversation, tapping the menu button
and selecting ‘View contact’.
Send messages from your PC
Unlike other messaging apps such as
Facebook Messenger (messenger.com)
and Telegram (telegram.org), you can’t
install WhatsApp on more than one
device, which is annoying if you don’t
have your phone to hand. One solution
is to use WhatsApp Web, which lets you
send messages and files from your
desktop browser (provided your phone
is switched on and has an internet
connection).
To use the tool, open the app’s main
menu and select WhatsApp Web. Next,
visit web.whatsapp.com in your browser
and use your phone to scan the QR
code that appears onscreen. All your
chats will be displayed on the page, and
you can search or start new chats and
send photos or videos. If you select the
‘Keep me signed in’ option, you should
be able to access your WhatsApp chats
even if you leave your phone at home.
You can sign out by tapping the
WhatsApp Web menu on your phone
and choosing Log Out.
One of the most frustrating things about WhatsApp – and many other
messaging apps – is that there’s no way of ‘unsending’ messages that you’ve
sent in haste or by accident. Happily, this feature has been included in the
beta version of the app since April 2017, and we hope it’ll make its way
to the stable release soon. In the beta app, you have up to five minutes
to cancel your message, after which it’s sent for good.

Make free voice calls over Wi-Fi
WhatsApp lets you make free voice calls
whenever you have a Wi-Fi connection,
which is handy when you’re abroad and
don’t want to pay expensive roaming
charges. Even when you’re not
connected to a wireless network, the
feature can be cost-effective if your
phone contract is geared towards free
mobile data rather than free phone calls.
To call someone using WhatsApp,
simply tap the phone button at the top
of the chat. If you’ve never called a
contact before, go to the Calls tab and
tap the phone button to find them. You
can find a log of all your previous calls
on this tab and call someone again with
one tap.
Make a Skype-style video call
Only a year ago, you needed a dedicated
app such as Skype to make video calls
from your Android device. Now, you can
make free video calls directly from
WhatsApp, simply by opening a chat
with the appropriate person and
tapping the
video camera
icon next to
their name and
last-online
status.
For even
faster calling,
tap the
contact’s
profile photo in
the Chats tab
and press the
video-camera
icon that appears. Video calls are logged
with normal voice calls on the Calls tab.
Send a voice message
We seem to receive fewer voicemails
than ever these days, which isn’t
surprising because picking them up is
such a hassle. However, WhatsApp lets
you leave audio messages (without
waiting for a contact’s phone to ring
out), which work in the same way as
visual voicemail, letting you skip
backwards and forwards and replay
them as many times as you like. To send
a voice message, just press and hold the
microphone icon in the appropriate chat
for as long as you need to speak. You
can cancel the message by swiping
immediately left.
Share important news with
everyone
If you’ve got some important news to
announce, WhatsApp’s Broadcast
feature lets you send a message to
several of your contacts in one go. Open
the main menu, then choose ‘New
broadcast’ and choose who to share
your news with (only people who have
your phone number in their contacts list
will receive the message). Next, tap the
tick and compose your message. You
can attach photos or videos as with a
normal chat.

What we liked:
One of the enticements
promised by Microsoft for
the Autumn Creators
Update was a new app
called Story Remix which,
it claimed, would cut
together photos using a
simple timeline and add all manner of
amazing options such as 3D animations
and explosive special effects. Since
then, the concept has been toned down
considerably – it now has a much
reduced set of features – and instead of
being an app in its own right, it’s buried
so deep in Windows 10’s preinstalled
Photos app that you could easily miss it.
It’s well worth digging out, though,
because although it doesn’t deliver the
dynamic (and, some would say,
excessive) tools that Microsoft originally
promised, it manages to provide an
arguably more useful function: a simple
video clipper that trims your collection
of videos into a fast-paced montage
with cheerful background music.
There are manual tweaks you can
carry out to improve your film: add a
simple title to the beginning; reselect
parts from longer videos that you want
to include (the software doesn’t appear
to be that good at choosing the
highlight of a clip by itself); add colour
filters to make dull
weather look
brighter or footage
look older; and add pan and zoom
effects to still photos. You can also
choose the accompanying music, either
from your own collection or using
Microsoft’s 12 tracks, which are designed
to adjust to the length of your movie
(though only if it’s relatively short).
How it can be improved:
Having got our hopes up by hyping
Story Remix, Microsoft has now hidden
it away like an embarrassing secret. To
find it, go to Photos, Albums and choose
to create a new album, then select the
videos you want to include. You’ll see a
small Edit button, which you click to
make your changes. We’d also like the
software to be better at choosing the
best bits of clips automatically.
OUR VERDICT
Considering this tool essentially
chucks together your home videos
with no effort on your part, it’s
remarkably efficient at producing
something watchable. And because
it’s already in your Photos app, you
don’t even have to install it!
Shooting video is easy
but setting aside time to
edit your footage can be
a chore. Andy Shaw finds
the simplest ways to
create quick, no-hassle

Automatic video-editing tools

Discuss automatic video-editing tools at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
This is the first
time that
commercial
software
developer Magix
has brought out a
free video-editing tool.
It’s essentially a stripped-back
version of its Pro software, with
fewer editing options, designed
to provide a simple three-step
process: import your video
clips; choose a soundtrack;
then create and share your video.
We like the way Magix Fastcut takes a
long clip and cuts it into several shorter
ones, effectively chopping up longer
scenes into shorter, edited moments.
It doesn’t always manage to choose the
best bits of footage but it did a
surprisingly solid job on our test videos.
However, if you want to have more
control over how the clips get trimmed,
you’ll need to upgrade to the Pro
version for £39.99.
How it can be improved:
The software is restrictively simple,
What we liked:
Microsoft stopped
supporting
Windows Movie
Maker in January,
but it still works
well in Windows 10
and is available to
download for free as part of the
Windows Live suite from places
such as Major Geeks (bit.ly/wmm434).
It’s designed to perform a full manual
edit rather than an automated one, but
it’s also able to string some selected
clips together, drop a soundtrack over it
and hope for the best. It even has a
handful of video templates to add titles
and credit rolls without any fuss and,
while it doesn’t manage this as well as
the other two award winners, it provides
you with a lot more tools to tweak your
video further, should you want to.
How it can be improved
What this software won’t do is choose
sections of your clips – you’ll have to do
that yourself. That inevitably means that
your video is likely to be longer and
more boring because you’ll never be
as ruthless at cutting your own footage
as an automated process. Don’t hold
your breath for this to change, though,
because Microsoft has washed its hands
of the software.
so you’ll have to just like what it creates,
or lump it. You can’t reorder your
chosen videos or adjust the length of
time they last, and you’re forced to add
music to your project, whether you want
to or not, which isn’t much good if you’d
like to hear the original footage.
OUR VERDICT
Given the right situation, Fastcut is
a great little tool, but its simplicity
makes it very inflexible. It lives up to
its name but it’s not perfect.
OUR VERDICT
We’re still mourning the passing of
Movie Maker, which reminds us of
the glory days of Windows 7, but
despite Microsoft’s neglect, the
software still stands up and it
continues to be one of the best free
tools for editing videos.
Wondershare Filmora
bit.ly/film434
This free version of a paid-for
program has tools for manually
editing your footage but includes a
quick-editing option you can use if
you don’t want to go the whole hog.
However, we found the quick option
did an appalling job of creating our
video, choosing rubbish clips,
ignoring half of what we pointed it
to and still having the cheek to stick
a massive Filmora watermark over
it. Very disappointing.
Movie Maker: Free Video Editor
bit.ly/mmfve434
Cynically named to cash in on
anyone looking for Microsoft’s
discontinued program, this ad-
supported horror is available from
the Windows Store. We found it
frustrating to use and far from
worthy of its user reviews, which
have somehow provided it with
three out of five stars – three more
than it deserves.
Apple iMovie
bit.ly/imov434
Unlike Microsoft’s abandoning of
Movie Maker, Apple continues to
develop its bundled video editing-
tool for MacOS. While it’s a fully-
featured editor, it also creates short
semi-automatic movies from your
clips. However, they’re heavily
templated to look like movie
trailers, which we felt made our
footage look charmless and clichéd.

Disable noisy autoplaying
Facebook videos
As our columnist Barry Collins
noted in Issue 431, Facebook’s
“infuriating decision” to have
videos automatically play with sound
has turned it into the equivalent of a
“crappy novelty birthday card”. Who
wants to be browsing their news feed
on the bus, in the doctor’s waiting room
or during a boring speech, only for their
phone to blast out ear-splitting audio
from an irritating advert, ‘hilarious’
prank video or poorly recorded gig?
Nobody, that’s who.
Fortunately, there is a way to silence
this noisy nuisance. On your Android
phone or tablet, open the menu in the
top-right corner of the Facebook app,
swipe down to App Settings and switch
off the option ‘Videos in News Feed
start with sound’. To stop videos
autoplaying completely, tap Auto-play
on the Settings screen and select Never
Auto-play Videos.
On iOS, tap the More menu in the
bottom-right corner of the app, go to
Settings, Account Settings, select
‘Videos and Photos’ and toggle the
switch for ‘Videos in News Feed Start
with Sound’ to Off. You can also turn off
Autoplay completely.
On the Facebook website, videos
autoplay silently, but even this can
prove annoying. To stop it, click the
down arrow in the top-right corner,
select Settings and click Videos. Click
the drop-down menu next to Auto-play
Videos and select Off.
Stop YouTube playing videos
automatically
YouTube has two forms of
autoplaying videos: those
that begin when you load
a YouTube page; and those that play
automatically once you’ve finished
viewing the current video. The latter
type is more annoying, because you
probably have better things to do than
sit around watching ‘suggested’ videos
Don’t let autoplaying
videos and adverts drive
you to distraction.
Robert Irvine reveals
how to silence the noisy
nuisance – for good
all day. Luckily, it’s easy to turn it off.
On the YouTube website and apps,
just slide the Autoplay option above
the ‘Up next’ list to the ‘off’ position.
If you want to stop all YouTube videos
starting until you click ‘play’, we
recommend the brilliant Magic Actions
for YouTube (bit.ly/magic434), for
Chrome, Firefox and Opera. This
feature-packed extension gives you
total control over your YouTube viewing
experience, and its handy ‘Stop
Autoplay’ setting prevents videos from
playing automatically.
Annoyingly, the latest version of
Magic Actions doesn’t display its
Options page until you disable your ad
blocker, but it’s still a fantastic free tool.

Stop autoplaying
Prevent streaming services
from autoplaying
Netflix has a feature called
Post-Play that automatically
plays the next episode of
a TV show when you finish watching
the current one. This is a great way to
‘binge watch’ series because you don’t
need to manually select the following
episode, but in other circumstances,
Post-Play is more of a hindrance than
a help – if you’ve specifically chosen to
watch a show out of sequence, or you
really need to go to bed!
To turn off this feature, go to the
Netflix website, click your name in the
top-right corner, select Your Account
and click ‘Playback settings’. Under
Preferences, deselect the option ‘Play
next episode automatically’ and click
Save. This setting will also be applied
when you watch Netflix on your mobile
device or smart TV.
Amazon Video’s Next Up
feature autoplays episodes in
the same way. To turn it off, go
to the Amazon Video Settings page (bit
.ly/amazon434), scroll down to Player
Preferences and set Auto Play to Off.
Block autoplaying content in
your browser
Chrome once had a useful
setting to stop plugins playing
video, audio and adverts
automatically, but this was removed in
version 55 – possibly to placate
advertisers who don’t want their
content frozen. However, there is now
an option to stop HTML5 content
autoplaying, which achieves similar
results. Type chrome:flags into your
address bar, press Enter and use Ctrl+F
to find the entry ‘Autoplay policy’. Click
the drop-down menu next to this, select
‘User gesture is required for cross-origin
iFrames’ and restart Chrome.
To block auto-playing media in
Firefox, type about:config in
the address bar, press Enter and
confirm that you’ll be careful. Search for
the preference ‘media.autoplay.enabled’
and double-click it to change its value
to ‘false’.
If you only want to mute the sound for
autoplaying videos, install Silent Site
Sound Blocker for Chrome (bit.ly/
silent434) or Mute Sites By Default for
Firefox (bit.ly/mute434).
Filter autoplaying videos on
Mail Online
The world’s most popular news
site, Mail Online (dailymail
.co.uk), assaults you with
autoplaying ‘flyout’ videos when you
scroll past the video players embedded
in articles. If this gets on your nerves as
much as it does ours, there is a simple
trick that blocks the flyouts while
allowing HTML5 content on other sites.
Open your ad blocker (assuming you
have one – uBlock Origin and Adblock
Plus are the best options), go to the
filters section and create a new filter to
block the element dailymail.co.
uk##.vjs-flyout-placeholder.
Save this and when you next browse
Mail Online, videos will only start when
you click to play them.
Stop Spotify playing songs
automatically
When you reach the end of
an album, playlist or selection
of tracks on Spotify, the
streaming service automatically plays
similar songs “so the music never stops”.
However, there are plenty of times when
having the music stop would actually be
rather a good thing, so here’s how to
disable autoplay. In the Desktop version
of Spotify, click the down arrow in the
top-right corner, select Settings and
scroll down to Autoplay. Switch the
setting ‘Autoplay similar songs when
your music ends’ to Off. In the Spotify
apps for Android and iOS, go to Your
Library (or Your Music), Settings,
Playback and turn off Autoplay there.
Google has
exhibited a rather
contradictory
attitude towards
autoplaying content.
On the one hand,
it’s been testing
‘video previews’ –
six-second clips that
play automatically
– in its search results
on both desktop
and mobile. These
only display when
you’re connected to Wi-Fi and only
play audio when you click them,
but they’ve already been described
as “one of the most annoying
features ever” (bit.ly/annoying434).
On the other hand, in a recent post
on its Chromium blog
(bit.ly/chromium434),
Google said: “one of
the most frequent user
concerns is unexpected
media playback, which
can use data, consume
power and make
unwanted noise”,
before going on to
outline its plan to make
autoplay “more
consistent”.
Essentially, this
means that from Chrome 64
onwards, videos will only play
automatically without sound or if the
user has shown an interest in their
content. Sounds to us like Google
wants to autoplay its cake and eat it!
WILL GOOGLE AUTOPLAY OR PAUSE?
Don’t want to watch a whole TV series in

Get a second opinion
about a threat
Sometimes, security software
such as Avast, Malwarebytes or
Kaspersky flags a program as being
infected, when it’s actually perfectly
clean – an error known as a false-
positive (because it’s falsely identified as
a positive threat). If you’re in any doubt
– perhaps you read about the download
in a reputable internet magazine – you
should seek a second opinion from
VirusTotal (www.virustotal.com).
This powerful online service (owned
by Google) lets you upload a suspicious
file, or copy and paste a potentially
malicious URL, to check for threats using
more than 60 popular antivirus scanners
and URL-blacklisting services. If the item
comes up clean, or is only flagged by a
couple of engines, then it’s safe to install.
If uploading a file sounds like too
much hassle, the free program Winja
(bit.ly/winja434) provides an easy-to-
use front end for VirusTotal that lets you
use it like a standard antivirus scanner.
Run software blocked
by Windows
Windows Defender
SmartScreen springs into action if you
try to install unknown software from an
unrecognised source, and sometimes
tries to block programs from smaller,
lesser-known developers. The error
message in Windows 10 informs you
that “Windows Defender SmartScreen
prevented an unrecognised app from
starting.
Running
this app
might
put your
PC at
risk.”
It then
provides
a ‘Don’t run’ button with seemingly
no way around this block. However,
if you’re completely sure the program
in question is safe, you can force
Windows to run it. Click the ‘More info’
link under the error message, then click
the ‘Run anyway’ button that appears.
Windows will install or run the software
with no further warnings.
Sometimes even the best security
tools get it wrong. Wayne
Williams explains what to do
when overzealous defences flag,
block and filter innocuous ‘threats’
You can also grant a program
permission to open before you run it.
Right-click the EXE file and select
Properties. In the Security section at the
bottom, tick the Unblock box, then
Apply and OK. You will now be able to
run your program.
If you find that SmartScreen regularly
blocks programs you want to install, you
can disable the feature altogether. Type
Windows Defender into the search
box and launch the Windows Defender
Security Centre. Click ‘App and browser
control’ and, under ‘Check apps and
files’, change the setting from ‘Warn’ to
‘Off’. This page also lets you disable
SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge.
Find out what other
users think
If a program you’ve already
installed is causing problems with your
security software – such as your firewall
blocking its access to the internet – one
of the best ways to check it for malware
is by using Should I Remove It (bit.ly/
should434). This handy free tool scans
all your installed programs, then
provides you with a list that ranks them
in order of how highly it recommends
that you uninstall them. Programs
flagged red represent a potential
security risk and should be removed
Spot and stop

immediately, while green ones are safe
to keep.
You can visit the Should I Remove It
website for a full explanation of the
program in question and how many
other users have removed it. Bear in
mind that just because other people
remove a piece of software, it doesn’t
mean it’s bad – they may simply have
found a better alternative.
Tweak your security
settings
If your antivirus software has
gone as far as quarantining a program
you’ve downloaded, it’s usually possible
to unblock it – but we don’t recommend
doing so. If there’s even the smallest
shred of doubt, you should leave the
‘infected’ file where it is and follow your
security software provider’s official
procedure for querying a potential false
positive (see our last tip, ‘Report false
positives’). That way, you’ll know that
the file has been verified by experts
before you run it.
If, on the other hand, a program you
know to be safe is being blocked by
your firewall, then it’s possible to
unblock it. Instructions for doing so
will depend on the firewall you’re using.
In Windows Firewall, for example,
click ‘Allow programs [or apps] to
communicate through Windows
Firewall’, then ‘Change settings’ and
select the program you want to unblock.
Deselect bundled
junk automatically
A lot of freeware programs
come bundled with unwanted extras
these days, which may – rightly or
wrongly – trigger alerts in your security
software. Provided you have your wits
about you when installing a program,
you can usually spot and reject these
extras (choosing the ‘Custom’ install
option rather than the ‘Recommended’
choice is always advisable), but an
easier way is to use Unchecky
(unchecky.com). This free tool runs in
the background and monitors all
installations, automatically rejecting and
unticking any extras and offers that are
nothing to do with the main program.
Stop Chrome blocking
safe websites
Chrome automatically blocks
websites that contain “dangerous and
deceptive content” – typically malware,
scripts or phishing links. It’s usually very
efficient but when, occasionally, a
harmless site gets blocked by accident,
you can bypass the warning to access
the content you want.
To view a blocked website, click the
Details link and select ‘Visit this unsafe
site’. The page should then load. Google
will attempt to strip out any unsafe
content, but if you want to see the entire
site, click the Content Blocked icon at
the right of the address bar and select
‘Load full site’. To download an “unsafe”
file using Google’s browser, click the
top-right menu button, open
Downloads, locate the file you want and
select ‘Recover malicious file’.
Finally, if you want to disable these
alerts entirely, Go to More, Settings,
click Advanced and under ‘Privacy and
security’, toggle the switch for ‘Protect
you and your device from dangerous
sites’ to Off.
Report false positives
You can help anti-malware
companies reduce the
number of false positives their software
flags up by reporting files that are
erroneously identified as threats. Most
security software developers provide
a way for you to submit files, so they
can avoid misidentifying them as
malware in future. Sophos, for example,
has a form you can access at bit.ly/
sophos434. Avast (which also owns
AVG) lets you report a suspected false
positive at bit.ly/avastfp434, while
Symantec’s form can be found at bit.ly/
symantec434.
Earlier this year, web users who
downloaded IObit’s Advanced
SystemCare 10 found that
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware wrongly
identified the software as a
potentially unwanted program (PUP)
and removed it. Excluding Advanced
SystemCare from Malwarebytes
scans made no difference, the ‘threat’
was still detected and deleted. After
these false positives were identified,
IObit said it “initiated a self-
inspection of its programs” to
eliminate the causes, and accused
Malwarebytes of engaging in “vicious
competition”.
Other popular programs that have
been mislabelled as malware include
file-sharing tool Pushbullet, privacy
scanner PrivaZer, image editor Zoner
Photo Studio and even the essential
Windows system file ‘user32.dll’.

composite images by using layers and
blending together elements from
different pictures can breathe new life
into your snaps.
Adobe Photoshop has the tools you

you want to achieve similar results for
free, use Image Inc instead. It’s very easy
to master – just load two images and
pick a suitable mask to blend them
together, then use its fine-tuning options
to refine your work. You can even stack
multiple overlays to create more
advanced images.

The same editing options are also
available for the base image, 1
and the overlay edit lets you choose
a different Layer Blend Mode, 2
including Normal, Multiply, Overlay,
Reflect, Colour Burn, Glow, Hue,
Saturation and Lightness. The differences
range from subtle to striking.
1
Start by loading the images you want
to blend together. Click Load to
import the base image, 1 then navigate
to the file you want to add. It will appear
as a thumbnail 2 and in the preview
window on the right. Next, click Load for
the Overlay image. 3 It will overwrite the
base image entirely.
2
Next, click the Load button under
Mask 1 and pick one you want to use.
2 The default selection of available
masks is located at C:\Cybia\ImageInc\
Masks. As soon as you add the mask, the
two images will be blended together. 3
You can zoom in and out of the result
using your left and right mouse buttons.
3
You can change the mask by clicking
the Load button and selecting
a different one, or by clicking Edit. 1
Select the latter option and you can use
the drop-down box to pick a Gradient
Preset. 2 Options include Linear,
Diagonal, Radial, Diamond, Reflected,
and None (Clear). We’ve used Linear.
Give the subject of your photo an entirely new

The Mask options window also offers
some simple editing tools that
achieve interesting results. You can rotate
the mask in 90-degree steps, 1 flip it
horizontally 2 or vertically, 3 convert
the image to greyscale (if using your
own masks – the defaults are already
greyscale), 4 and invert the mask. 5

Convert your Android videos to slo-mo
S
ome phones come with a slo-mo option on their
cameras. This means that you can record video at an
increased frame rate so, when you play it back, the
action appears slowed down. If your phone doesn’t have this
option, you can use VivaVideo to get
the same effect. This video editor is
free to install and can slow down (or
speed up) your regular video footage.
VivaVideo: bit.ly/viva434 |

1
We recommend that
you get the correct
footage before you
start applying slo-mo,
by recording the video
in your camera app in
advance. When you’re
happy with your video,
launch the app and tap
Edit. 1 Alternatively, you
can record a video
straight into the app.
If you’d prefer to do this,
tap Capture 2 instead.
2
Select the video
from the list of
available options
and trim any unwanted
sections. Use the sliders 1
to move the start and end
of the video to the point
you want. Tap the scissors
2 to cut it to the selected
length, then tap Add 3
to send the trimmed video
clip to the editor.
3
On the next screen,
tap Next to see
a preview of the
trimmed video. Tap Edit,
then ‘Clip edit’ and select
Clip Speed. 1 You’ll see
a slider with ~[ to the left
and 1x, 2x and 4x to the
right. Push the pointer to
the left to apply the
slo-mo effect. If you want
to speed up the action
instead of slowing it
down, move the pointer
to the right.
4
Each time you move
the pointer on the
slider bar 1 you’ll
see a preview of how the
video will look at the new
speed. 2 Choose the
speed that provides the
best balance between
slowing down the action
and making it look too
jerky. When you’re happy
with the speed you’ve
chosen, tap OK. 3
5
You’re returned to
the ‘Clip edit’ screen.
Preview your video
by pressing the Play
button 1 and check that
you’re happy with it.
You can still Trim the
video from here, 2
or reverse it 3 to make
the video play backwards.
You can even add another
video, 4 perhaps of the
same content shot from
another angle, to make
it look really professional.
6
Tap the tick in the
top-right corner and
select Share. Press
Export To Gallery 1 to
send the video to the
Gallery, or choose one of
the social-media buttons
2 if you just can’t wait to
share it with your friends.
Either way, the video will

Get to grips with some serious PC DIY to boost
your computer’s performance

How to...
Automate your home for
less with smart plugs
What you’ll need
Smart plugs are essentially pass-through
plugs that fit into ordinary electrical
sockets in your home and let you control
whatever electrical items you plug into
them using an app. They’re similar in
principle to those mechanical timers that
automatically switch your lights on to a
schedule when you’re away from home,
except they offer much more control via
the app, and you can tweak their settings
H
ome automation is all the rage these days. You can
buy smart plugs, smart lighting, smart locks, smart
thermostats, video doorbells and central control
points, such as Amazon’s Echo. The price of these
gadgets is coming down all the time – they mostly cost a
fraction of what you’d have paid a few years ago – but
going the whole hog and fully automating your home can
still cost a small fortune. Luckily, you don’t have to splash
out on dedicated smart devices. With a few smart plugs
and a little imagination, you can automate a variety of
tasks in your home and keep costs to a minimum. We
show you how to get started.
M T W T F S S
You don’t have to spend a fortune to turn your house into a smart
home. Wayne Williams gets to grips with smart plugs
Smart plugs are available from lots of
manufactures so feel free to shop around
even when out of the house. You can
switch them on manually, schedule them
to come on (and go off) at a time that
suits you, and even control them by voice
using your smartphone or, if supported,
Amazon Alexa.
You can buy smart plugs from various
hardware manufacturers, including

TP-Link (bit.ly/tpli434), WeMo (bit.ly/
wem434) and D-Link (bit.ly/dli434). How
many you’ll need is up to you – it
depends on what you want to do and
how many devices you want to include.
For this guide, we’re using the TP-Link
Smart Plug because at £25 on Amazon,
it’s the cheapest of the bunch and is just
as versatile as more expensive rivals.
We’ll show you how to set up and use
a TP-Link device in our Mini Workshops
below and on page 61.
Switch lights on and off
One of the most practical uses for a
smart plug is to control the lighting in
your home. It won’t work with your main
lights, which are turned on and off via
wall-mounted light switches, but it will
work perfectly with any plugged-in
1
To get
started,
download
the TP-Link
Kasa app
(bit.ly/
tpka434)
on your
mobile
device and
connect
your smart
plug to the
mains.
Launch the
app and tap
the plus symbol in the top right-hand
corner to add your first device. Scroll
down and tap the Smart Plug entry. 1
2
The Wi-Fi
light on
your plug
should turn a
solid amber
and then,
after 15
seconds or so,
blink amber
and green.
Go to your
phone’s
Settings and
open the
Wi-Fi.
Connect to
the Smart Plug’s built-in Wi-Fi network.
Return to the app and enter a name for
your new plug. 1 Tap Next. 2

Pick an
icon for
your plug
– there are
lots to
choose from
– and tap
Next. You’ll
now be
invited to

password 1
so the plug
can join your
wireless
network. Tap Connect and the plug will
be added. Tap Next, then Done, and it
will appear in your Devices list. Add
any more plugs in the same way.
If all else fails, you could also use the plug
to turn your lights on, as long as you’re
not the type to hide under the duvet!
Keep your home safe
You can set smart plugs to switch on
security cameras when your home is
unoccupied or you’re in bed asleep, so
they’re not running all the time, wasting
electricity and recording your own
movements around the house. And if you
often charge devices such as mobile
phones, tablets and laptops overnight,
you could use a smart plug to stop the
charge after a few hours to ensure your
devices don’t overheat or suffer battery
damage. Alternatively, if you want to be
sure of having a full charge when you
wake up, have the power go on in the
early hours of the morning instead.
Name your different devices and assign an icon that indicates their purpose

table lamps. You can schedule the lights
to switch on and go off whenever you
like, or control them remotely using an
app. This could deter would-be intruders
because your home will appear to be
occupied, even if you’re out at work
or away on holiday. Varying the time
that the lights come on is even more
effective, because someone watching
your home may notice if the schedule
is too regimented.
Wake up in the morning
If you struggle to get out of bed in the
morning, smart plugs can help to rouse
you from your slumber. You can use one

MINI WORKSHOP | Control your devices remotely
Christmas lights aren’t quite the hazard
they’re often portrayed as being, but it’s
always better to be safe than sorry.
With the festive season fast approaching,
why not rig up a smart plug to control
the lights on your tree and manage any
external lights that are connected
indoors?
Control children’s
entertainment
As any parent knows, it’s no mean feat
prying children away from electrical
devices such as games
consoles, TVs and
laptops, but with a
smart plug you can set
hard restrictions –
having the power on
these entertainments
go off at a time of your
choosing. The trick is
unlikely to work with
older kids who will
probably be able to
work out that they can
simply plug into a
socket with no smart
plug, but you could
add an extra hurdle by
also connecting your
router to a smart plug,
so the internet goes
off when you want it
to, then comes back
on when younger
family members are
tucked up in bed.
Reduce power consumption
Having smart plugs turn electrical items
on or off as required can save electricity,
and the TP-Link plugs we’re using also
have a built-in energy-control feature that
analyses each connected device’s power
usage, then presents this information in
the app. This lets you see at a glance just
how much energy your connected
devices consume, and allows you to
adjust your electricity usage accordingly.
Use TP Link’s Kasa app
The TP-Link Smart Plug is controlled
using a free app for iOS or Android
(bit.ly/tpka434). As well as connecting
plugs, you can use it to connect and
control Kasa cameras and set ‘scenes’
for different times of day (Good Morning
turns on all your devices, Good Night
turns them all off, Movie Night dims the
lights, and Custom lets you create your
own scene, determining which devices
are on or off).
If you also add a smart router, you can
have even more control over all your
devices. The app also lets you view past
activity.
1
Once
you’ve
got one or
more plugs
connected
to your
network,
you’re ready
to start
controlling
them.
Launch Kasa
and your list
of devices
will appear.
Select one.
You’ll be able to turn it on or off simply
by tapping the Power button. 1 The
total time it’s been running will be
shown. 2
2
To create
a schedule
for the plug
– the times
when it
should switch
on or off – tap
the Schedule
button. 1
If you’re
going to be
away from
home, tap
Away 2 and
you’ll be able
to set start
and end times, as well as the days to
repeat this. You can also set a timer. 3
3
To
control
your plug
remotely,
you’ll need
to create a
free Kasa
account and
verify your
email
address.
When that’s
done, tap
the Settings
cog in the
top-right
corner and enable Remote Control. 1
From here, you can change the
device’s name and icon, 2 and view
the time/location 3 and device info. 4

Screen Recording lets you record
what’s happening on your screen
as a video clip. Press the Record button
in Control Centre and it counts down
from three, then starts recording the
screen. A red bar appears at the top
to show that it’s recording. Swipe up
to access the Control Centre and press
the Record button again to stop. The
video is saved to your Photos library.
This could be useful if you want to
show someone how to perform an
action on an iOS device – just record
a short video and send it to them.
Apple TV Remote lets you

your iPhone or iPad instead of

Call for help
A new tool in iOS 11 provides a simple
way to get help in an emergency,
should you ever need it. Open
Settings, tap Emergency SOS and
turn on the switch. Now, when you
are in danger or there is a serious
problem of some sort, pressing the
power button five times causes the
iPhone to emit a siren at maximum
volume (it seems louder than normal
to us), and a countdown timer
appears on the screen.
After a count of three, the iPhone
automatically dials the emergency
services and notifies your emergency
contacts. There is a link at the bottom
of the Emergency SOS screen for
editing your emergency contact
O
n 19 September, Apple released iOS 11, the latest
upgrade to its mobile operating system. The Control
Centre has been redesigned and is still accessed by
swiping up on your screen. However, you may find you have
to swipe twice on an iPad, because if the first swipe doesn’t
extend far enough it may only summon the new dock.
The functions of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi buttons have
changed slightly. Switching them off in the Control Centre
disconnects your iPhone or iPad from any devices it is
connected to, such as your wireless router and Bluetooth
headphones, but keeps the wireless adapters switched on
to allow for quick reconnection. To fully switch off Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth, and avoid wasting battery power, you have
to open Settings, tap the individual menu options for each
connection and toggle the switch to Off.
Turn off wireless adapters
Customise the Control Centre
In previous versions of iOS, the Control
Centre was a simple app that you could
summon to access a few basic tools.
In iOS 11, the interface has undergone
a noticeable redesign, which can be
customised in a number of ways.
Open Settings and tap Control Centre,
then Customise Controls. The current
controls at the top are the same as in
previous versions of iOS, but the More
Controls section below offers a long list
of extra items that can be added. Press
the green plus buttons to add them.
Here are a few of our favourites:
Do Not Disturb While Driving stops
distracting notifications appearing
while you’re driving. You shouldn’t
respond to your phone’s beeps and
dings when you’re at the wheel, so
tapping the car icon in Control Centre
turns them off completely.

More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
numbers. Tap it to add the details for
anyone you wish to notify.
If you want to try this feature, make
sure you cancel the call before the timer
counts down to zero.
Mute messages
There are all sorts of reasons why you
might want to shut your messages up
for a while, whether they’re from
a service you’re not interested in,
a persistent person who isn’t giving up
or you’re in a group chat that’s
particularly active when you’d prefer
not to join in. You can now ‘mute’ these
conversations without affecting other
people in the group or even letting them
know you’re no longer listening.
On the main Messages screen, swipe
left over a conversation to reveal two
buttons on the right: Delete and Hide
Alerts. Pressing Hide Alerts places a tiny
crescent-moon icon on the left of the
conversation to indicate that its
notifications are muted. Slide left over
it again and tap Show Alerts to
re-enable the notifications.
Save animated GIFs
Animated GIFs have been around for
years but they seem to be particularly
popular at the moment. In iOS 11, you
can save them to your photo library
and view them in the Photos app.
If you see a GIF you like on a web
page, press and hold it until a menu
appears, then select the option to save
it. Open the Photos app, select the
All Photos album and tap the image.
The animation plays and you can enjoy
it to your heart’s content.
appears in the bottom-left corner of
the screen for several seconds. If you
tap this before it disappears, an editor
opens that lets you crop, draw on and
annotate your screenshot before
saving it. Its tools include a pencil,
pen, broad-tipped marker and eraser,
and you can add text or sign your
name by tapping the plus button in
the bottom-right corner. Rectangles,
circles, arrows and speech bubbles
are available too.
Scan QR codes
QR codes are those randomly
patterned squares that sometimes
appear on products, adverts, posters
and other places. They contain
information, such as website URLs
and other data, encoded in the dots,
like a sophisticated bar code.
Previously, you needed a QR-code
reader app on the iPhone or iPad
to read them but with iOS 11, you can
simply point your iPhone or iPad
camera at the QR code. There are
no buttons or controls to press –
the QR code is recognised
automatically and a message appears
at the top of the screen showing
whatever information it contains.
For example, if it contains a URL,
it may ask if you want to use Safari
to visit the website.
Offload unused apps
If you have an older iPhone or iPad
with only 16GB of storage, you may
find yourself running out of space.
Because any app you own, free or
paid-for, is yours forever, iOS 11 can
temporarily delete apps to free up
space on your device, then reinstall
them when they’re needed. Go to
Settings, press iTunes & App Stores
and scroll down to the bottom of the
page. Turn on the switch next to
Offload Unused Apps.
Use keyboard tricks
In iOS 11, you can take advantage
of the larger keys on your iPad’s
onscreen keyboard by using a feature
called Key Flicks. Each key now
displays a second character, smaller
and in light grey, above the main
character. For example, the top row
of letters now includes the numbers
0 to 9, so you no longer have to
switch to a separate keyboard to type
them. To type the main character,
you simply tap its key as before. To
type the secondary character, press
its key and swipe down, then let go.
Typing one-handed on your iPhone
– holding the device in your hand and
hitting at letters using your thumb –
can be a bit of a stretch, but now
there’s a solution. Press and hold
the Emoji button. A menu appears
showing three keyboards: the
standard version is shown in the
centre, flanked by keyboards for
typing one-handed with your left
or right hand. Selecting one of these
moves all the keys over to the left
or right so they are easier to reach.
Edit screenshots
Holding down the Home and Power
buttons together on an iPhone or iPad
and then releasing them instantly
takes a screenshot. In iOS 11,

Press the power button five times in an

Remove pirates from email
Q
When I logged into my Outlook
webmail account yesterday, I saw
a skull and crossbones image and a
pop-up message with something about
talking like a pirate. I quickly quit my
browser, thinking it might be malware,
but when I scanned the hard drive for
viruses, I didn’t find any. Today I logged
back into Outlook and everything seems
normal. What should I do?
Owen Nolan, via email
A
Ahoy, matey! Yo-ho-ho! This is just
Microsoft having fun. Since 1995,
19 September has been designated
International Talk Like A Pirate Day. It’s
not as well known as other special days
such as April Fools day, but it’s still
celebrated in the UK, particularly by
primary schools.
Clicking the icon would have made
some subtle changes to the Outlook
interface, such as adding skull and
crossbones icons to the menu bar,
changing Search to ‘Hunt for’, and
turning ‘new message’ into ‘firing a
salvo’. You’ll have to wait until next year
to see it again, although Microsoft may
pull a different prank next time.

Like A Pirate Day at bit.ly/pira434.
GENERAL PC
Clear space for the update
Q
How much hard-drive space do
I need to upgrade to Windows 10
Autumn Creators Update?
Steve Gray, via email
A
The update is a 5GB download.
However, before it installs, your PC
makes a backup of the Windows folder,
which could be 20GB or more. So in
total, you probably need about 30GB
of hard-drive space to be safe. You can
recover this later by using the Disk
Cleanup tool on the Start menu to
delete the installation files and backups.
GENERAL PC
Windows 7 not booting
Q
When I press F2 on my Packard Bell
PC’s splash screen to access setup,
it makes a shrill sound. Can I download
a boot disk instead?
John Keefe, via email
A
Pressing F2 opens the BIOS setup
on Packard Bell PCs. There is rarely
any need to change these and if
Windows 7 isn’t starting, a better option
is to press F8.
If you’re using a laptop, you may need
to hold down the Fn (Function) key as
you press F8. It can be tricky to get the
timing right and it won’t work if you
press it too soon or too late. Switch on
the power and press F8 repeatedly to
try and catch the appropriate moment.
If you get this right, a boot menu
appears. Select Safe Mode and see if
Windows starts up. If it does, find
Command Prompt on the Start menu,
right-click it and run it as an
administrator. Type sfc /scannow and
press Enter to check and repair
Windows files.
If Windows won’t start in Safe Mode,
go back to the boot menu and select
Repair Your Computer. Continue to the
screen showing Startup Repair and
System Restore. Try Startup Repair first
and if that doesn’t solve the problem,
return to this menu and use System
Restore to put your PC back to
a previous working configuration.
You can download Windows 7 from
bit.ly/win434 and use another computer
to burn it to DVD.
SECURITY
Get a VPN for free
Q
I’ve been reading about how VPNs
make your internet browsing secure
so no one can track you, but all the ones
I’ve looked at require a subscription. Are
there any free ones?
Sean Fox, via email
Q
I have a problem with a tile on the
Windows 10 Start menu. The icon
is tiny and appears in the top-left
corner. All the other tiles have full-size
icons. How do I change the size of the
icon on the tile?
Tom Ryan, via email
A
From your screenshot, it looks as
if the tile is inside a folder. If you
drag a tile and drop it onto another
tile, you create a folder that can
contain multiple tiles. For example,
you could place all your games in a
Games folder so they occupy just one
tile on the Start menu, and each game
will appear as a little icon. But there’s
no point having a folder for just one
tile, so click the folder to show the tile,
then click and drag it to a new position
among the Start tiles. The empty
folder disappears automatically.

a free VPN service, but you have to sit
through a video ad before you can

Fix broken file associations
Q
When I double-click a photo in
Windows 10, it usually opens in
Windows Photo Viewer. I set this up not
long after I upgraded to Windows 10.
However, sometimes it opens in the
Photos app or Paint. Why does it do this
and how do I get Windows to use the
same program for all my photos? Is
there a problem with my PC’s Registry?
Paul Nicol, via email
A
It’s probably not a Registry problem.
The most likely reason is that your
photos are in different file formats, such
as JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF and so on. You
may have set the association between
JPEG and Windows Photo Viewer but
other extensions could still be set to
other programs.
File extensions are usually hidden,
which makes it harder to differentiate
between a ‘.jpg’ image and a ‘.jpeg’, or
any of the other formats. Open Explorer,
click the View menu and tick ‘Filename
extensions’ in the ribbon toolbar to
display the file types.
Whenever a file opens in the wrong
program, quit the program, right-click
the file and select ‘Open with’, then
‘Choose another app’. Find the app you

Next time you see the message,
check the drive letter. Your hard
drive may be partitioned, so while the
C: drive may be fine, it could be a
partition such as D: that’s full, or even
a USB drive or memory stick.
If the C: drive is the problem, click
Start and run Disk Clean-up (it’s under
Windows Administrative Tools in
Windows 10; or Accessories, System
Tools in Windows 7). Click ‘Clean up
system files’. When the window
returns, tick every box and click OK.
No matter which drive or partition is
full, you’ll need to move some files to
another storage device such as a USB
memory stick or USB hard drive.
To stop the message appearing,
press Windows+R, type regedit and

Make your taskbar
super-transparent
The Windows 10 taskbar uses a
transparency effect that lets you see
your Desktop and any windows behind it.
This is most noticeable when you set the
taskbar to hide automatically. Open the
Settings app, click Personalisation, select
Taskbar and switch on ‘Automatically
hide the taskbar in desktop mode’.
You can also increase its transparency
by making a simple Registry tweak.
Press Windows+R, type regedit and
press Enter. Go to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Explorer\Advanced
Right-click in the right pane and
select New, followed by ‘DWORD

creating it and set its value to 1.
Now return to the Settings app and
Choose Personalisation, then Colours.
Turn the ‘Transparency effects’ setting

Mute your email
If you open an email in Gmail (or tick

Clicking this option archives the email,
which moves it out of your Inbox. You
can still access the message from the
All Mail box by clicking More in the
sidebar and selecting All Mail. The
best part, however, is that if you then
receive further messages related to
the muted one – if, for example, you’re
having a conversation with someone
by email – they won’t appear in the
inbox either but will remain in All
Messages with the previous message.
I’ve never needed to use this feature
but it’s handy to know it’s there if you
ever become tired of a conversation,

Find your misplaced phone
I think I may have seen this advice in the

Web User readers how useful Android’s
‘Find My Device’ tool (bit.ly/
findmydevice434) can be. Last week,
while I was out for dinner, I couldn’t find
my phone and wasn’t sure if I’d left it at
home or lost it in the pub we’d visited
beforehand. My other half suggested
I use the Find My Device app, so I
entered my Google email address and
password, and within seconds it showed
that my device was right where I was
standing. I checked my pockets again
(more thoroughly this time) and there it
was! I blame the glass of wine I’d had,
but it’s great to know that this app can
put your mind at rest if you think you’ve
left your phone somewhere.

Save Facebook posts
If you see an interesting post in your

you don’t want to read it straight away,
you can easily save it for later. Click the

surprisingly few people I’ve spoken to
seem to know about it.

you might need to click ‘See more’).

Customise Opera’s ‘New Tab’
page
If you don’t like seeing the ‘Speed
Dial suggestions’ and the Search Box
when you open a new tab in Opera,
you can easily change it. To get rid of
the Speed Dial suggestions, go to
Settings, then Browser and untick the
appropriate option under ‘Start page’.
Alternatively, click the ‘Customise start
page’ icon in the top-right corner of the
New Tab page, then untick ‘Show Speed
Dial suggestions’.
You can also get rid of the search box.
First make sure ‘Show advanced settings’
is ticked in Settings, then click the
‘Customise start page’ icon, untick
‘Search box’ and it will disappear. There
are a few other useful options here, too,
including the ability to change the
wallpaper on the New Tab page!

Select text with Shift+arrow keys,
Shift+Home or Shift+End. Ctrl+A selects

for italic and Ctrl+U for underline. Press
Ctrl+Shift+5 to cycle through all the fonts

Disguise your location
The other day, I was trying to access the
US version of a website on my phone,
so I enabled Opera VPN (bit.ly/
opera434) and set United States as the
location. However, I couldn’t get the US
version of the site to load in Google
Chrome – perhaps because I was logged
into my Google account. I decided to try
Firefox (bit.ly/firefox434) instead, and
this worked straight away. So, if you have
trouble getting Chrome to work with
a VPN, I’d suggest giving another
browser a try and see if that fixes it.

There’s no need to go to such

Why do programs show as
‘Not responding’?
Q
I keep getting the message ‘Not
responding’ appearing in programs.
It usually starts in Firefox, but eventually
affects everything and my laptop slows
to a virtual standstill.
If I reboot, it’s okay again for a couple
of days but then eventually starts again.
I have scanned the computer with
Kaspersky (bit.ly/kas434), Malwarebytes
(www.malwarebytes.com) and
AdwCleaner (bit.ly/adwc434), and they
all came back clean. I am also getting
‘Unresponsive script’ messages, usually
after waking my laptop from sleep, and
most of these mention Chrome, although
the browser isn’t open and I rarely use it.
I don’t know if these two things are
connected or not.
rufford155, Web User Forums
A
If you don’t use Chrome, then there’s
no point in having it installed, so I’d
uninstall it. That should eliminate the
second problem. With regard to the ‘not
responding’ problem, something seems
to be using up your memory. It could be
one or more of the add-ons in Firefox.
Running Firefox in its Safe Mode to see
if the problem clears up will point to one
or more add-ons, and you will then need
to re-enable them one at a time until the
problem starts again. If that doesn’t do
the trick, open Task Manager by right-
clicking the taskbar and choosing it from
the menu. Click ‘More details’ and see if
you can identify the Apps or ‘Background

I have added a folder called Spares

I’ve found this really useful for moving
files that I don’t need. However, now that
I’ve created a second Spares folder within
a different folder of photos, all files that
I move using the shortcut still go to the
first Spares folder I created. How do I get
the ‘Send to’ shortcut to copy files to the
appropriate Spares folder?
ERICG, Web User Forums
A
You can’t expect Windows to know
which Spares folder you want to
send files to, based on what you’re
copying, so you need to create a
separate ‘Send to’ shortcut for each
Spares folder. Don’t use two shortcuts
of the same name or the duplicate
shortcut will be automatically renamed
with a (2) next to it. If I were you, I’d
remove the shortcut you’ve already made
and create folders and shortcuts with
more specific names, such as ‘Summer
holiday 2017 additional images’ and
‘Winter holiday 2017 additional images’,
so you don’t get confused.

Left-handed picture isn’t
right
I just can’t help responding to the picture
accompanying your Star Email in Issue
432 on the subject of left-handed web
users. The message ‘I’m a lefty’ is written
on a left hand, so therefore it must have
been written by someone who is
right-handed! I don’t
believe for one minute
that I am the only
reader sad enough
to point this out.

Discipline yourself to use
both hands
Regarding your Star Email, I am also
left-handed (and left-legged, to boot!).
I bought my ﬁrst computer in 1993 at the
age of 53 – a second-hand Compaq 386
with 8MB of RAM. From the start,
although it felt alien, I disciplined myself
to use the mouse with my right hand,
leaving my left hand free for using
a graphics pen. I became quite adept
at using both at the same time, scrolling
with one and clicking with the other.
Today, I have an Intel Core i7 laptop
and use the pen in my left hand and the
touchpad with the right. All it needs is
a bit of self discipline, with no need for
whingeing or inconveniencing others.

egarding eBay scams and
how to avoid them: I have
been using eBay for many
years, both as a buyer and a seller,
without any problems. As with
buying from anywhere, you have
to use common sense and not be
drawn into ‘too good to be true’
bargains. I know people do get
scammed but it’s quite often down
to their own greed or gullibility.
For example, if someone offers
a top-of-the-range laptop at
a ridiculously low price, it’s obviously
too good to be true, but a mist
descends for some people and even
though their brain tells them to be
careful, the greed takes over and they
fall for the scam.
You should always be suspicious
of a newly registered seller, especially
Stay safe on eBay using common sense
if they are selling direct from China
(scammers often mislead buyers about
where they are really based). If a listing
looks suspicious, then it most probably is.
The only problem I have ever had was
when I bought a second-hand graphics
card that the seller forgot to pay postage
on. It got lost in the post and the seller
refunded me, so it was
no problem really.
If you’re buying odds and ends
and small-value items, you’ll
probably be safe. You can often
ﬁnd useful stuff that’s not easy
to obtain elsewhere, such as
second-hand books and DVDs.
Buying from trusted shops and
businesses via eBay is as safe as
buying from anywhere else and
sometimes works out cheaper
than buying directly from
a company’s website, because there’s
often no postage to pay.
As always when purchasing online,
do your research properly. Don’t just
click and buy, check elsewhere ﬁrst
and – in my humble opinion – you will
be 99.99% safe on eBay.

I can’t trust CCleaner any
more
I am disgusted
with the makers
of CCleaner for
releasing an
update to the
program that
contained
malware (Need to
Know, Issue 433). Surely a company with
as many millions of users as Piriform
should have the decency to ensure their
software is safe before making it
available across the world? That’s just
common sense, especially because many
of us have our installations of CCleaner
set to download updates automatically,
so we are immediately put at risk when
they are not properly checked.
Luckily, in this instance, I was not one
of those infected by the malicious code,
but it’s certainly made me reconsider
having CCleaner installed on my PC.
If this sort of thing can happen once,
how can I trust Piriform – or Avast,
or whoever’s responsible – that it won’t
happen again?

Leave your phone alone
while walking
I completely empathise with Barry
Collins in his column in Issue 433
when he complains about his
children being glued to their
phones at the dinner table. I ﬁnd it
impossible to walk down the street
these todays without bumping into
some zoned-out teenager whose
attention is completely focused on the
screen in their hand rather than what’s
happening around them.
It’s hardly surprising that there are so
many accidents these days when young
people can’t leave their phones alone for
ﬁve seconds! Not only are they putting
themselves at risk, but they are posing
a danger and inconvenience to other
people. If I had my way, there would be
the same strict controls on walking and
texting as there are on phoning and
driving – not that many idiots pay the
slightest attention to the latter.
I’m not saying that young people
shouldn’t use their phones at all, just that
they should pay a little more heed to the
world around them, so they don’t
obstruct and walk into others or get run
over. Surely they can wait until they sit
down to check their Facebook pages,
rather than constantly monitoring them
to see who’s ‘liked’ what?
It seems ironic to me that mobile
phones were designed as a means of
making communication easier, but have
turned into one of the most anti-social
devices ever invented!

Facebook causes more
problems than it solves
I was amused by Barry’s
column in Issue 431
about Facebook’s loud
autoplaying videos.
But if people are so
annoyed by
Facebook, then why
don’t they just delete
their Facebook
accounts? The simple
reason is because everybody
else is on Facebook, therefore there is
this feeling of being alone and losing
touch if you delete your account.
However, it seems to me that
nowadays Facebook seems to cause
more arguments and problems than
it solves. One example is when
I was trying to ﬁnd the people I was
going to be sharing a ﬂat with (you can
connect with your future ﬂatmates
through Facebook groups). Someone
in the group wrote that I’d probably be
in my room while everyone else was
chilling together, simply because I was
late to joining the group.
I ﬁnd that as much as Facebook brings
people together, it also brings people too
close together, which is why problems
on Facebook often arise. Why not have
a Facebook break in the evenings?
I have now deleted my Facebook
account, but have to wait 14 days or so
for this to be conﬁrmed.

Never agree to a free SEO
offer
In Build a Better Site in Issue 433, Ray
Fielding asks about “free SEO”. It sounds
as if the offer he received by email was
unsolicited, in other words it’s spam! Rule
number one for spam is never to respond
in any way whatsoever. No reputable
SEO company would send spam. Always
remember that “there’s no such thing as
a free lunch” and that reputable SEO
companies charge money.
Ray asks “what’s the worst thing that
can happen?”. Well, if you agree to let
a company carry out free SEO, you’re
going to give an unknown third party
the username and password to make
changes to your website. That
immediately breaks security rule number
one: never disclose your password.
The worst they might do is to use your
website to host malware or originate
more spam. In that case, your hosting
company is entitled to delete your site
and cancel your contract with no notice
or refund.
Google provides some excellent advice
on SEO at bit.ly/googleseo434.

Wi-Fi kettle suits me

Thanks for your DVD-writing
advice
I was pleased to see my name in Ask the
Expert in Issue 432 (bit.ly/webuser432)
regarding my query about using an
external DVD writer with a tablet while
on holiday.
It was good
to hear that
I was not
alone in
having
problems.

appreciate
Roland’s
comments
and you may
be pleased
to know that
after a ﬁnal
attempt with
a DVD writer from Amazon (a Kinden
model with a USB 3 port), and using an
external power supply, I was successful.
In my original letter, I failed to explain
that the main purpose of connecting
a writer to my tablet was to play DVD
movies from a company called Redbox
(www.redbox.com). They have kiosks
outside most US supermarkets and other
stores where you can hire DVDs for one
night for $1.35 (about £1). Last year,
for example, I had Eye in the Sky for
one evening.
Some of the places I stay in when
visiting the States do not provide a DVD
player, hence my query. I would never
dream of using the writer to copy ﬁlms.
Thank you again Roland for your
response and carry on with the very
useful tips that I ﬁnd on your page.

What you
say...

74 18 - 31 October 2017
Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
two years since I started using it, not
long after that 2015 buyout, I can’t recall
a single update of note. Most criminally
of all, while Microsoft was begging other
app makers to create ‘Live Tiles’ for the
Windows 10 Start Menu, it couldn’t even
be bothered to make one for
Wunderlist. And what better use of
a Live Tile than as an at-a-glance
reminder of the
tasks in your to-do
list? It’s precisely
the short snippets
of data that the
Start Menu was
designed for!
Then, earlier this
year, came the
inevitable announcement. Microsoft was
shutting down Wunderlist in favour of
a new app, Microsoft To-Do. This new
app looked like Wunderlist but was
missing half of its most useful features:
no sub-tasks, no option to make notes
on tasks, no integration with all the
calendar apps that Wunderlist
supported.
To this day, Microsoft’s own Outlook
Barry Collins is sick of his favourite apps
being eaten up and spat out by tech giants
Page 404
app will display to-do items in your
calendar from the condemned
Wunderlist, but not from To-Do.
Only Microsoft could fork out $150m
on an app and then spend two years
making it worse.
Well, I say ‘only Microsoft’, but that’s
not true. All the big tech firms are at it:
hoovering up innovative apps that could
be potential
competitors and
then either sucking
them up into the
Borg or closing
them down entirely.
The Sunrise calendar
app (also bought
by Microsoft), the
Picasa photo software (Google), the
Quickoffice mobile app (Google again)
and TweetDeck (Twitter) – all once
popular apps that have either been
closed or significantly worsened since
the big boys got hold of them.
Part of the blame lies with the app
makers themselves. Many of these apps
are given away for free, haemorrhaging
money with no conceivable means of
ever making a profit. They’re launched
with the specific intent of one day being
snapped up by Microsoft, Google or any
other internet behemoth with wads of
cash to chuck around.
And once they’ve picked up their big
cheque, the developers disappear over
the horizon, often launching new apps
with the specific hope that they too will
eventually be snaffled by the giants.
Caught in the crossfire of all this are
you and me – the customers. The big
shiny corporations don’t care if you’re
a devoted user of the app they’ve just
bought – they’ll strip the assets, shut it
down and tell you to sling your hook.
After all, like buses, there will be another
one along in a minute.
Only Microsoft could
fork out $150m on an app
and then spend two years
making it worse
E
very so often, of a Wednesday
morning, I’ll get an email from
the estimable editor of this ﬁne
organ, saying something like:
“Forgotten your column again?”
Admittedly, there’s only one thing
responsible for this occasional lapse
of memory and that’s yours truly.
But if I’m taking someone down with me,
it’s Microsoft.
In 2015, Microsoft splashed out
somewhere in the region of $150m
on the magnificent to-do list app
Wunderlist. Beautifully designed,
compatible with almost every mobile
and desktop platform you can think of
and stuffed with useful features, it was
easy to see why Microsoft might want
to make Wunderlist its own.
The purchase of Wunderlist “further
demonstrates Microsoft’s commitment
to delivering market-leading mobile
apps across the platforms and devices
our customers use,” said Microsoft’s
spokesperson Eran Megiddo at the time.
Sadly, this was a 100%, copper-
bottomed fib.
Microsoft left Wunderlist to rot. In the
