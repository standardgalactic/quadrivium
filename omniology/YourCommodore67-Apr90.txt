hen the going gets t ode
the tough get even tougher.
And due to inﬂation rates,
rising costs, sproggets, ﬂanges,
and the price of Oranges in South
America, many magazines ore to
ﬁnd the coming few months very
tough indeed (some may even
and drop by the wayside). YC,
though, is so utter fob, wicked, and
certainly tough enough to give you
what you want.
Although games are now
coming out few and far between,
we still supply you this month with
the ﬁrst EXCLUSIVE review of Space
Harrier II on the C64. and that can't
be bad, as well as several other stiffy
reviews to keep you going.
Also, it has been brought to my
attention that a certain 'Pretender to
the Crown' has recently slated this
wonderful magazine (I always get
affronted when someone tokes one
at MY organ) and stated that their
pile of poo is the 'ority C64 games
mog available'. Go on dear reader,
inform them that they ore wrong, if
only for the sake of my deﬂated
ego.
Another small change this is the
inclusion of a cassette inlay (one for
each of the last four YC topes), so
now the only thing we don't supply
are the boxes, you'll hove to do that
yourself. And, oh yes, a few of the
designs have got even WACKIER
(how could this be), well, we are the
FUN magazine!

Those busy little buds at Activision, despite recently IOSJI)g AI nuncio Barry,
hove been working double extra overtime. Two games are coming our
way pretty soon, and they both sound crispy hot pooplie stuff.
Hammerﬁst is based in the future - seldom are games based in the
post - when men ore really Cybernauts, women ore real Cybernauts and
Cybernauts ore pretty much like real men and women. Other than acting
really funky, exciting and utterly def (what?), you must punch, kick, maim
and kiss (the Glasgow Kiss, that is!) your way through many mutated
beings for very little reason indeed,
Sonic Boom needs little introduction as a) it is vertically scrolling shooty,
b) is based on the Sego coin-op of the some name and, c) because it
features little more than average action. Should be a good blast anyway.
They'll both cost around the 1,9.99 mark for the Cassette and 614.99
for the Disk versions.

I have hod my C64 for a year now
and I hove been reading Zzap, but
one day I picked up a copy of YC
and was pleasantly surprised. I was
amazed to see that the mag only
•
catered for the 64, unlike Zzap and
CU, and it hasn't converted to the
superior Amiga
I liked the idea of having free
computer games on every mag, but
I think the price is way too high, and
if you lowered it you would get
loads more readers.
Jason Frost W O  30
PA: Who said we need more
readers? Anyway if you wish to
7PSE?
compare us to Zzop, they are now
priced 6130, only 45p less than
ourselves. 3-4 games for 45p can't
be bad.
Glad to see you liked our lethal
dose of funkiness though. and as
the only dedicated C64/C128 mag
around we hope to cater for your
speciﬁc tastes every month (as long
as you like chainsows, death and
mayhem).

You know - it's not often that you
ﬁnd a startling piece of historical
data in a computer mag, but on
page 14 of December's issue, the
Storm Across Europe review states
that Hitler launched his blitzkrieg
against Poland in Sept 1945! Just
goes to show how time and all
those cobweb covered historians
distort the facts!!! I hereby claim my
free copy of Storm Across Europe, or
was it Asia?
Anyway, the real reason I am
writing is to thank US Gold for being
so prompt in helping me out of a

It is greatly opprock :ed.
I am delighted with your

couldn't bear it anymore!

As a reader of "Your Commodore"
for many years, and of the old "Your
64", I have noticed a big decline in
the last few months.
I buy a computer magazine to
read about computers - if I wont to
see photos of pop stars or read
about movies I'd buy another sort of
magazine. As your magazine has
now turned into a games magazine
I sholl no longer be buying it I'll

I'm sorry to see "Your

Before you changed your image,
and name to YC, you used to be
called Your Commodore. I
personally hated Your Commodore,
and never bought on issue until
December. I love your NEW image
and I think its good, although I think
that one day one of your reviewers
will spoil it, like the last ever Your
Commodore.
It was spoilt by the review of
Batman by Tony Hetherington who
grossly underated it. I don't know
what he was doing when he gave
BIM 56%! He MUST be mad!
BIM is simply one of the best C64
games around in presentation.
graphics, sound, and gameplay. The
swinging rope effect was a great
idea in the 1st and last levels, which
mode it a million times better than
a "boring shoot-ern-up". as Your
Commodore so kindly put it.
I loved the BIM game (I'd never
have guessed - PA) and I still do,
and as you can see I'm not
one. &VG may gave the C64
version 92% (a cVG HIT!), Eap
(how dare ybu swear in this
magazine? PA) gave it 96% (a
gold medal) and CU gave it 86% (a
CU Screen Star).
I am not saying these mogs ore
better, but they were certainly better
than your old image, and gave the
games more of a chance.
But they are by no means better
than yollnew image, I last' hope
that a .
.otitel
Nitikr t  you give games a
chance with your new image. I am
happy. I j,,rst hope that this is the ﬁrst

This score is so pathetic that you

good news, though, is that you have
just the blend of la& of wit and

up to the standards set by

down version.

as in F-16. However, they
do vary in size and
difﬁculty. Information is
available about the
mission or you can alter or
plan your route.
Then you are sent to
weapons selection. This is
very similar to F-16 but not
as detailed or varied.
Once you're done here
you can get out to the
runway. The graphics in
Fighter Bomber are on
attempt or combination of
wire frame and solid 3D.
Technically they work;
however, the inclusion
ﬁlled in graphics makes
the screen update
painfully slow. The missiles
are done in realistic
perspective and snake off
into the distance. Bombs
are invisible but crunch into
the ground on impact.
The control system
works extremely well. The
numerical keys are used to
put on the thrust, in
increments of 10%. This
allows easy control of
power and the
afterburners. Other controls
include the normal
undercarriage, rudders and
airbrakes. Weapon
selection is simple. being A C C
toggled with a single key.
There ore only Iwo
different display panels;
the weapons and
navigation data.
Without doubt the most
impressive features are the
various views of the plane.
Available by selection are
views from the control
tower (zoom in and out
camera style), the view
from above, from behind
or the side. These are all
rotatable. There is also a
weapon's eye view and
an enemy plane view.
These are all very ef f ea
and ﬁlled in.
The missions ore on the
most part difﬁcult. This is
portly the idea but mostly
the fact that the game is
so slow. The impression of
speed just isn't convincing
at all. Flying towards
ﬁxed ground feature
seems to take forever and
they aren't that interesting
when you ﬁnally get there.
Dogﬁghting is a difﬁcult
yet challenging part of the
game. The enemy planes
are at no advantage to
yours in terms of speed. As
usual in these games.
though, the pilots are
rough to defeat at close
ronge.
Fighter Bomber just
seems to lack the
necessary depth required
for simulation games to be
successful. The
programmers have
concentrated too much on
the different views and
graphics. InSITe0d they
should have tried to cut
down the movement
time. As a result, Fighter
Bomber poles into
insigniﬁcance in the light of

Activision would have
done better by avoiding
the simulation and making
the game more of an
arcade type. Still, a nice

5  ixiy tons of steel
come rolling down
the highway of hell
with you at the helm. The
enemy come head-on
guns blazing and only skill
and more than a little luck
will see you through the
day. If you prove your
worth untold battles lie
before you, but ﬂunk out,
and you die, when the
steel starts rolling there are
only winners.
Getting your hands on
the latest American
hardware can prove a little
expensive nor to mention
dangerous so settle for the
next best thing, Steel
Thunder. You can choose
between four types of tank
to explore three countries
in twenty four missions.
Rumbling across foreign
landscapes letting rip with
your canon is a gratifying
experience which is all too
soon ended when the
enemy return ﬁre and you
ﬁnd yourself piloting a pile
of scrap. This is not an
arcade game but a full

by yourself).

conjurer's trick, the missions
appear before you. After
selecting the killing ground
you choose the hardware,
a MAIAI Abrams, M60A3,
M3 Bradley or the M48A5
Patton. Each tank has its
own specialities so before
selecting the vehicle for
the mission iris best to look
up the tank speciﬁcs in the
user manual. You have
your machine, now you
need the crew. Apart from
yourself you need a driver,
a gunner, and a loader.
For each job you ore
presented with a list of
possible troopers complete
with stars. Your job is to
choose the team that will
get the job done. One last
procedure to follow before
hitting the action and that
is the armament. You can
go with the preconﬁgured
tank or customize it for
your own style of ﬁghting.
Crew assembled, you
run through the ﬁnal check

sequence, switching on the
engine's turret motors and
arming the smoke
grenades. Go to the map,
plot your course and tell
the driver to roll.
You can switch from
gunner, driver and
command positions of the
tank but a player with faith
in their crew can issue the
orders and lay back. When
the ﬂak starts to fall you
know you hove arrived.
Lay down the smoke and
switch the gunnery screen,
the gunner loads the
ammo you have selected
and either you or the
gunner can let rip with
those explosive shells.
The view from your
tank is limited, taken up
mostly by the status lights
and gauges. When you do
encounter another vehicle
or bunker the graphical
image is limited but the

identity objects to avoid
wasting your own troops.

system, You get the
chance to bulldoze enemy
forces with ten ton death
dealing machines. There
ore siX ready-to-mash
battle scenarios. These are
based on real iife battles
so you can rewrite history.
These battles are based in
Min.*, Moscow, Kharkov,
Prokhorovka( I), Konev on d
Korsun. The scenarios are
almost as hard to play as
they ore to soy!
Each battle is in depth
and a complex strategic

dissipated.
There ore several
unusual options available
in Panzer Bottles. The map

bottles can be completely

redesignable are the icons
themselves. So if you think
that you can do better

goes as far as the w , e r
forecast, the time an

different orders you can
issue. These include
deploy, defend, assault
and support. Once you
have set up your
commands you con run
the latest set of orders. You
sit back and watch the fun
begin!
Your forces ore
represented by re:gin
or Formations. These vary
inpower and a status
report con be obtained.
Once you send out your

You're left in the dark as to

The manuals are both very
comprehensive and
helpful. The ﬁrst derails the

explains each Comm___
step by step. It also shol1"
how to redesign,the
various graphic.
The other manual takes
you through a typical turn
of the Moscow bafﬂe. This
is very useful for getting
into the game when ﬁrst
playing_ At the bock there
are derailed breakdowns
of each bafﬂe, including
notes for the player's
assistance, The battle
editing system lets you
either rebuild a bottle from
scratch or change an
existing scenario. This
makes the game hold a
longer lasting appeal for
the player.
The graphics ore well
done but nor superb, but
that is what you'd expect
from a wargame. There is
a deﬁnite long term
challenge in this game.
The designer is a great
boost to the lasting interest.
This also makes it better
value for money. For fans
of wargames this is the
ultimate. For non-fans this is
as interesting as shaving

how far the ball ﬂies and

The graphics ore
chunkier than some golf
games (Leaderboard for

more realistic. Sound as

inclusion of skins play

having a choice of three

game you hove $10,000 to spend.
The minimum stoke in each game is

The roulette is very well done. Ail
of the features of the real thing are

bets. The wheel spins and each bet
is shown again and whether it has
won or lost. The poker plays a
reasonable game but is nor very

Dragon Wors is an excellent
game and one that I strongly
recommend. The use of skills within
the gome adds an extra dimension
to the traditional hack and slash
routines and the story line ﬂows a lot
better than the original Bards Tale
series.
Dear Mr Barbarian
I think that your column is great
and that you ore the best thing to
happen to adventures since the
Flying Scotsman was taken out of

Dear Peter,
Shut up you sycophantic little git.
Crawling like that is one sure way
not to become DBBOTM. Do I have
to spell it out. Only bribery works.,
Dear Sir,
Barbarians are renowned for
having more brawn than brain. Train
spotters feature in the evolutionary
scale somewhere just above slugs.
Yet some of your writing seems to
involve a modicum of grey cells.
How do you explain this apparent
paradox?
Dove Poggridge, Bury Sr Edmunds
Dear Dave
Consider the following:
I All rules have exceptions
2 Statement one is a rule
3 Therefore statement one much

4 Therefore all rules do not hove
exceptions
Does that simplify things for you?
Good, because I expect a two
poge discussion by you for the next
issue. Alternatively, write on essay in
my top ten train numbers and why.
This sort of banality is certainly a
worthy winner of Dragon Bottom

thunders ever onwards to
the station of the future
with half of us clinging onto the
sides, trying nor to fall off, and the
other half running behind,
attempting to keep up.
Things move so fast that people
don't really consider a product's
disadvantages before it's out on the
streets and being used by you or I.
This can be said about the thing we
all take for granted when using a
computer._ the screen.
Using a home computer, such as
the Commodore 64, means there
are any number of screen types that
can be used: Televisions are the
most common and Monitors, for
those with a little bit more cash
(lucky dogs).
Monitors are quite similar too, if
not the same as, the VDUs used in
ofﬁces which have been accused of
causing a number of problems
including stress, reproductive
difﬁculties for women, eyesight
problems and headaches. This is all
because the humble VDU kicks out
one hell of a load of waves
(although surﬁng on these ones
could be a no-no).
We've got... 'Soft' x-rays -
nobody really knows what x-rays do

V I I M
10 WAYS YOUR
COMMODORE COULD
KILL YOU...
1. The computer could fall on you
(from about 100 feet)
2. The Monitor/N could fall on you
3. The Monitor/N could explode
4. The computer could explode
5. You could explode
6. The keyboard could become
"live" and electrocute you
7. Aliens could land seeking
homicidal revenge for the deaths of
their friends in all those shoor-em-
ups
8. You could play with it in the bath
and get electrocuted
9. Through playing a game about
the occult you could become
horribly obssessed and sacriﬁce
yourself at Midnight
10. You could play US Golds original
OutRun and die laughing (or crying)
10 THINGS MORE
DANGEROUS THAN
YOUR COMMODORE
MONITOR/Rim
1, Cars
2. Meteorites
3, Lightning
4. Street violence
5. Sunbeds
6. Sharks
7. Cho i nsows
8. Tube lines
9. Lions
10. Accountants
A Chainsaw ﬁghting is considerably more
dangerous than VDUs.
',Ashley is about to ﬁnd out why!
to people, although it is generally
agreed that too much of them is
dangerous... Ultra-violet radiation
has been known to cause skin
cancer (as in hot countries and those
with a hole in the ozone layer)...
Intro-red - heat - can cause
drowsiness or irritability._ Microwaves
(yes! as in ovens!) are known to be
a bit dodgy, again, there's no
conclusive proof... and, ﬁnally, radio-
frequency radiation which all
appliances kick Out as well as high-
voltage power lines. People living
near such lines can suffer from
problems like depression and a
greater chance of cancer or general
illness.
Now, you're probably asking
yourselves, how does this affect me
with my Commodore 64 and my
colour TV. Well, the only problem
could be your eyesight, although Dr
Robert Linsky, an Optician says
'There's no sign of harm being done
by computer screens. People get
tired eyes, maybe headaches... a
feeling of dryness... it's not a natural
task.' He concludes: 'there's very
little you can do to damage your
vision. Of course, oil these problems
arise from spending too much time
using your computer. There is a
world Out there to be discovered
which can be as enjoyable as
blasting aliens.., ﬁlms, videos,
skateboarding, live music, massive
parties (and we're not talking jelly
and ice cream) and poisoning
pigeons (in the park).
The upshot of it all seems to be
that there's no real danger as long
as you're not mega-obsessive about
it! Yea! Pass the joystick!

impending bankruptcy,
disaster and Emlyn Hughes'
Audiogenic is now a proliﬁc
software house again. It is now a
one-mon ownership as opposed to
a three-man when Supersoft
stepped in. That man is Peter Calvet.
He told YC that the company is
starring a new policy,
"We're aiming to produce
games that don't alienate anybody.
No matter who you ore, young or
old, male or female, we want you
to be able to associate with and
play our games. We've scrapped
several projects in the past because
they haven't worked out as we'd
hoped. If we don't think a game is
good then how can anyone else?"
It is looking or producing games
which hove gameplay, are fun and
not over complex. The ﬁrst of these is
Ernlyn Hughes' Arcade Quiz which
emulates a pub style quiz game,
right down to the payout sequence.
Personally I feel that in the pubs it's
usually a bunch of half cut blokes
who bellow loudly at each other
that play these things. So how are
Grannies and little sisters going to
ﬁnd it? Time will tell,
Also still under development is
the Lone Wolf licence. This is about
as new 05 sliced bread, but the
game will eventually appear. Don't
hold your breath though!
AUDIOGENIC: A POTTED
HISTORY
Audiogenic in its current form has
been operating since 1985.
However, its roots are really for
furrher back than that. Digging
around its ancestory revealed a few
creepy-crawlies_ Are you sitting
comfortably? Too bad.
1978: Supersoft is born. In those
days it was as alive as a cross
between a spider and a sixteen ton
weight By now Audiogenic was
operating as a duplication
company.
1979: Audiogenic began
duplicating computer software.
Supersoft was well, being Supersoft.
1981: Audiogenic decided to
distribute American software. This
brings it to the conclusion that
software is a good thing to be in.
1982: It released Spiders of Mars.
Wow, someone get the bug spray...
1983: Grandmaster Chess was
Audiogenic's masterpiece this year.
It beat all comers our of sight in an
early computer chess competition.
Supersoft became a full time
concern instead of on Attic Attack
company.
1984: Depsite rumours of ﬁnancial
trouble, Audiogenic released
Graham Gooch's Test Cricket, which
was one of the best cricket games in
computing history. Also came Alice
in Videolond, an early attempt at a
Cinemcware style game.
Audiogenic went to court over
problems regarding Koala Pod
distribution.
1985: Audiogenic started to listen to
the rumours about its bankruptcy. It
gets bought out by Supersoft and
the new Audiogenic is born,
becoming more or less a BBC/
Electron company,
1987: Audiogenic releases that the
16-bit morket looks promising. So it
releases Impact, and sells tonnes of

copies on the 16-bit machines alone
(quite an achievement then).
Development began on a new
project invoking an unknown called
Emlyn Hughes.
1988: Hefter
Not so successful. EH Soccer
continued.
1989: Emlyn was unleashed on on
unsuspecting world. It's phenomenly
successful, and gets converted across
all formals.

WITH KIRK RUTTER
t
5  tuck on the latest games?
Well you've turned to the
right column. This month we
hove a Ghosts 'n Ghouls map.
plus tips. Every secret coin, door and
room revealed in Super Wonderboy
and, well see for yourself...
GHOULS 'N' GHOSTS
U.S. Gold
LEVEL 1
The third chest (c2 on the map) is a
magic chest and will only appear if
you climb the ladder just to the left,
then jump from the edge of the
ledge (to the right) cis far as you
can. Ignore all the chests marked 'C'
or you'll hove to duck down for a
while. The windspouts can be killed
when they stop spinning, The sixth
chest will appear when you jump
onto the next ledge. The best
weapon to kill the Gate-keeper is
the blue ﬁrebomb.
LEVEL 2
The best weapon for this level is the
ﬂying saucer. Don't bother about
48 ' 1  C
crossing the bridges as you'll only
land on the slug when it breaks,
much better just running down the
slope and jumping the slug. The
Snake's venom bolls seem to have
no effect on Sir Lanceolittle(!).
LEVEL 3
Level three is easy! Just watch our for
the knights at the start, blast 'em
before they con move. Openings
appear to the left of the screen,
take them as soon as possible to
avoid the puffa ﬁsh. The end of level
monster can only be killed if shot in
its eye, use the Blue-FireBomb. Only
half of level three is mapped, you'll
see why when you get there.
LEVEL 4
The problem in this level is getting
down the pipes. To stop slipping pull
the joystick diagonally down (right)
and don't let the hand's take you by
surprise, also watch Out for snakes.
The end guardian is easy to kill. He
has ﬁve heart's, just stand over a
heart and when it starts to beat zap
it. Do this quickly or maggots start to
appear.
Level 5
The only real problems on this level
are the For Cats. The best way to kill
the ﬁrst one is to use the blue
FireBomb special weapon, if you
don't have it let Lancealittle touch a
nostie, he will loose his armour but
will gain a few seconds of
invincability. Use this to get past the
cat. The second cat is slightly easier,
whilst standing at a distance just
blast his ﬁreballs, it kills him just the
same.

and exit via the platforms. Bock
above ground carry on going right,,
stop at the large cadn* line youise
up with it and jump for extra
Keep going right to exit.

Easy level this. Just keep going right
ignoring the Deaths. Oh, try not to
fall as the ground is covered with
spikes.
YC 5 3

LEVEL 7.2
Go left until you come to the Red
Knight, kill him and drop off the
ledge. Jump onto the ﬂoating
platform and when it reaches its
highest peak, hit the spacebar. Go
left, kill the ﬁreball, jump onto the
ﬁrst step and then jump up to reveal
a heart, grab it and carry on left.
LEVEL 7.3
Back where we starteol go left,
enter the ﬁrst door, kill the red knight
and carry on going left to exit this
level.
LEVEL 8
Make your way right using the
platforms. The ﬁrst door is a shield
shop, carry on right, the second door
is a bar, enter and buy a cocktail.
Enter the third door (above the
second door) and buy lightning.
Cony on going right, enter the cave.
LEVEL 8.1
This is quite a tricky level, just make
your way downwards (keeping to
the right) but beware the lava pit at
the very bottom.
LEVEL 82
Go right (ﬂy using the clouds to
avoid monsters) until you come to a
door. Enter the door, kill the demon
(he's easy) and exit to the right.
LEVEL 9
Easy, just keep going left
LEVEL 9.1
This is the some as level t h  a
few extra monsters, enter e  ﬁrst
door, kill Snow Kong and exit left.
LEVEL 10
Go right, enter the ﬁrst door and buy
a cocktail. Kill the two plants above
the door, line yourself up with the
door and wait (about 2 seconds) to
receive extra gold. Go right and fall
into the sea, walk right until you fall
into a hole. Jump to the left and
enter the door, buy what you need

LEVEL 6.1
Go right, jump the gap, carry on
right and jump the gop. Kill the
green snake and enter the door,
buy armour ond walk left (fall off
the ledge). Corry on to the left.
jump the gap and kill the three
snakes. Keep going until "OH"
.iappears, knock on the wall, buy th
cheapest boots. Go right and
down the gap. Jump the gap to th,
right and again "OH!" will appear,
knock on the wall and buy a
cocktail. Jump the tap to the left,
• lk left and fall off the ledge. Walk
ﬁ
platforms, jump up and enter the
ﬁrst door. The best way to kill this
ugly mutho is by trapping him in
corner and stabbing the hell out of
him, your sheild will protect you ,
from thunder bolts. Enter the second
door to leave this
LEVEll 7
Ignore the ﬁrst door (it's a book
shop) and enter the second, b
some revival medicine. If you
already have medicine ignore
second door, Enter the third d
and buy a cocktail. Go right, the
fourth door sells cures. The ﬁfth doot
is the gold collectoes den, kill him for
gold and a power-sword. Enter the
sixth door and a kind chicken will tell
you to go west. Keep going left until
you come to a ﬂoating platform,
jump onto it. The platform hurls you
into the air and you are now obove
the clouds. Make your way right
using the clouds as platforms. Each
cloud yields a bag of gold which
should appear as you jump on it, if
nothing happens, try walking about.
The last cloud has four bogs of golf.
When you can go right no further
take a running jump down.
LEVEL 7.1
Go right, ignoring the ﬁrst door, until
you come to a very tall ladder.
Climb the ladder and WonderBoy
will play the ﬂute, you can now
enter the door to the right,
and go right. On the third step just
before the exit, jump and you'll be
rewarded with some gold.
LEVEL 10.1
This is the some as level 5.1 with
added nasties. Go right until you
come to a lava pit, jump over this
using the platforms. When you
come to the second lava pit just fall
off the ledge (do not jump) to enter
o secret room, which is the same as
level 8.1
LEVEL 10.2
Go right, enter the ﬁrst door and buy
a cocktail. Go right and enter the
second door, buy the Knight Armour.
Kill the Red Knight and carry on
oing right. Enter the third door and
nasty from level 6.1 makes a
cameo appearance. Kill him using
some methods as before, Ignore
e forth door and enter the ﬁfth to
exit.
LEVEL 11
Getting very close now, perhaps you
can manage the level alone. One
quick rip though, the dragon's ﬂoor is
paved with gold.
LEVEL 11.1
This is it mate. There is only one door
on this level and we all know what's
behind thati You don't stand much
of a chance against the Meka
rogon unless you have power
pons like bombs, lightning or
ﬁreballs. Kill the dragon and watch
the rather dissapointing end-of-
game screen.

you ore the next Arton Senna
by blasting the all time high
score on the latest version of Out
run - so what's next. For most of us
the expense of real motor racing is
a hurdle far too high to climb, and
our illusions at becoming a
Champion fall onto the video
screen, but is that where they should
go?
Radio Control Model Car Racing
is one of the Uk's fastest growing
hobbies, and with companies like
Tamiya producing easy to build
relatively cheap models capable of
scale speeds of up to 400mph its
easy to see why.
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT
By far the most popular form of R/C
car racing is 1:10th off-rood. These
4.$

 come in either two or four

 drive and ore powered by six
1.2 volt rechargoble batteries
driving electric motors. The cars hailk ,
sophisticated suspension including o
ﬁlled dampers and adjustable
springing. The cars are capable of
speeds of up to 40mph - (over
400mph scale speed!)
Most of these 'off-road' buggies
come as a kit of parrs. The car needs
to be assembled, a radio control
system purchased and installed and
you're virtually off! On a national
level there is approximately 500
clubs in the UK which regularly hold
race meetings on Sundays. The
tracks usually consist of a mixture of
surfaces including dust, tarmac and
grass and usually include jumps,
romps, and obstacles.
Although a healthy amount of
racing takes place, by for the most
pleasure is gained from the 4
million non-racing car owners. From
this ﬁgure is easy to see thor most
'racing is carried Out in the back
garden or down the local park!

HOW FAR CAN YOU
GO?
By no means does it end there, R/C
car racing is big business! Both World
and European Championships are
held annually, capturing the
attendance of the major
manufacturers along with their full
time paid drivers.
The sport has World. European
and British governing bodies which
sanction rules and meetings, and
work towards making R/C car racing
more popular.
Wherever you start out you're bound
to have a lot of fun. Tamiya and
Kyosho are the two major
manufacturers and they produce a
whole range of cars from ready
built, ready to go models from
El 00 right up to sophisticated racing
machines for as much as E,1000.
The best advice is to go to your local
model shop - have a look at what's
in your price range and even pop
along to your local club. Watch out
though - R/C car racing is addictive
and can seriously damage your
wallet!

WHERE TO START
Well, now you're interested there's
various ways to start out, The British
Radio Car Association looks after the
sport here in the UK - and they con
give you local club names, rules and
dates of meetings.
Of course the best way to ﬁnd
out about the sport is to buy a
magazine! Radio Control Model
Cars Magazine features the latest
releases as well as lots of useful hints
and tips for beginners and is
published, as is K. by ASP in Hemel
Hempstead.

H
Zone after a fairly
disappointing ATBA Show. This
is supposed to be the main
arcade show of the year in the UK,
but to be honest, it was pretty boring
this time oround.
The shoot-em-up brigade seem
to be into sequels right now - R-
Type II mode an appearance and
although there's no question that it's
a well crafted piece of code, its
unlikely to ﬁre anyone up that
much.
It's the same horizontally scrolling
action with a big bad monster at the
end of each level, loads° power-
ups, etc. etc. For the ﬁrst few goes, as
you very soon get these astonishing
powerful weapons, it's quite a laff -
and quite a technical achievement
too, with all those sprites ﬂying
around - but._ well... I guess we've
seen this all before. Yawn.
Anyone game for - wait for it -
Grodius 111. Yes funsters, you thought
it was all over with Vulvan Venture
(which after all wasn't half bad) but
now those little tinkers down at
Konami hove decided that enough
certainly isn't enough.
Now I thought that Vulcan
Venture probably went a little bit
over the top when it came to user
friendliness. With Gradius III, the
programmers are simply crawling to
the punters.
You can select your sequence of
power-ups from a choice of ﬁve_ or
you can edit these sequences and
create your own! Mmmmm. Goes
without saying that you can select
your shield type independently of
all this - and when you've ﬁnished
and got up on the high score table,
nor only do you put in your initials,
but your sex... and star sign.
The game? You want to know
60 Y C
A The ATE! show - b000rming!
about the game? It's ﬁne. Everything
you'd expect from a team of coders
and graphic artists that have been
reﬁning this particular genre for
about ﬁve years now.
Slick, very playable - but nothing
new that we've not seen before.
Power-ups, yes! Big things at the end
of the level. yes! Is this beginning to
sound familiar? YES!!!
Well, at least Konomi hove given
us one decent original game this
year - Black Hole. Maybe they've
done their quota of original stuff
and are going to stick to yawn jobs
for the rest of 1990. 1 predict we can
expect to see S.P.Y. 11 previewed
somewhere very soon.
Atari Games, now. They were
showing an interesting new puzzle
game of theirs called Klax. Expect a
full review of that next issue, but I
can tell you that it looks interesting.
Something that did catch the
eye was a new game from them
called Badlands. What we are
actually talking about, however, is
Sprint Vt First there was Sprint - The
Black and White plan view racing
game. Then Spring 11, the two player
version. I think I can remember a
four player stand around version as
well. Then came the familar Super
Spring - three player and in colour.
Then Championship Spring - Two
player with extra tracks. Now
Badlands. And what do you do with
Badlands. You shoot, that's what!!

We are talking Super Sprint with
guns - and I have to admit, I luve it!
Maybe I've been crazed by all those
hours waiting in trafﬁc jams, but the
thought of blowing away a car in
front of me, makes me smile in an
extremely manic fashion. OK so I'm
sick Again, a full review of that
when we can get decent playing
lime on the unit.
Truxion - now there was a game
for real men, with a difﬁculty curve
that zoomed away into inﬁnity after
about third level. And what was it's
best feature? The power-up that
gave you those windscreenwipers of
death - lightning beams that sizzled
across the whole of the screen trying
anything in their path. Not
surprisingly, they've made it to
Tosplan's latest game too, Fire Shark.
Yes, this is o conventional vertical
scroller, one or two player shooter,
but it has that ployability that
Tosplan games are getting a
reputation for.
Date East are not well known for
this sort of game s o why, we might
well ask ourselves, hove they tried to
hove a go with Vapour Trail. The
answer only the deities know - it's
vertically scrolling, it's got OK
graphics, you can choose one of
three types of aircraft to ﬂy and you
fall asleep while playing it.
No, for me, the best thing of the
show was from Tait° - World Grand
Prix - Real Race Feeling, This is a
motor-bike game which has an
over the handlebars' view of the
action. The next difference you
notice is when you go around a
corner - when the whole of the
horozin tilts - just as in real life. A
difﬁcult technical test that has been
accomplished with great skill - and
it makes a real difference to the
playability of the things... plus the
little fans that blow air into your face
in order to simulate the vast speed
of your bike (I don't think).
It's not ﬁnished yet, but I expect it
to do very well indeed when it's
released later in the year.
Lastly - the two new mow 'em
downs from Sega and SNK (Line of
Fire and Beastbutsters) seem to be
ﬁnished now. Sego's effort is all scroll
and no action. SNK's is a cross
between its hit Mechanised Mock
and the shlock horror graphics of
Splatterhouse. Should do well - and
we'll be taking an in-depth look at
them next month,
Until then, give those aliens hell,
won't you. And don't press both
ﬂippers at once. J o h n  Cook

But for 'inwardly' you can put

If you're living in a small
farmhouse on the edge of a small
Suffolk village or working the
Hebridion Ferry lines then you'll
know the meaning of isolation. You
won't have a bevy of red
stockinged women cavorting until
the early hours on a ﬂoodlit stage
on the village green. You won't be
able to get hold of a IV. or a
computer by walking through your
back door and nipping over the
garden fence.
You might be lucky but if you
want a hooker or you want a one
night stand or you want a C64 then
you're going to go a distance or 2
to get what you want.
Soho has the reputation for
hooking but those in the know know
that it's moving out, moving to
dismissable places like Kings Cross. It
makes good sense - Victorio, Kings

are: and there ore cheaper hotels.

brands) computers.
While the Amiga is the
happening machine the ST, and the
064 ore going to have an extensive
range of releases in the New Year.
But for new addons it's dead-as-the-
dodo nme. A cute button for altering
the disk head but for the hardened
gamer the C64's going to get less
and less stuff as the years go.
Where as the C64 doesn't suffer
from virus's, like all computers and
all greedily searched after things,
they've become symbols of tack
and corruptibility. A ﬂower, or an
apple, on its own has the purity of
independence - especially when it's
in the ground or on the tree growing
in the ground.
Group them together, treat
them, and you've a marketable,
desirable and corruptable product.

product though, Illegal copying,

Uranium is running
short, but is needed for
fuel to power generators
to produce oxygen.
The only place where
this can be found is in the
caves below the Earth, the
labyrinth of caves ore
closely protected by alien
life forms.
You are the chosen
one, who has the task of
collecting Uranium from
each cave as you pass
through_ This can be done
by ﬁring phiseray at them
and transporting them on
to your ship •Celtrator'.
As you collect the
Uranium it will be
registered on your items
scale. Beware of the cave
walls, the enemy have
sensitised them, touching
them will severely
AM •
damage your power
shields.
No map has ever been
produced revealing the
way through the caves.
The aliens have invisible
barriers which constantly
change directions to
confuse the intruder.
If you succeed in
penetrating the caves you
will ﬁnd the enemy
headquarters. This you
must destroy.

A scrap of paper has

computer
programmers
probably have a diverse
range of graphic aids_
These may include screen
editors, character editors or
sprite editors. The only
problem is that none of
them can carry out all the
functions that the
programmer requires.
Obviously, the only way
around this is to use a
number of programs to
produce one ﬁnished
product.
For example, if you
were writing a game you
would use a character
editor to produce user
deﬁned characters, You
would then use these to
produce the actual
background for the game.
A sprite editor would be
used to produce the
sprites. Wouldn't it be
easier if it could be done
with one program which
encompassed all the
functions you will ever
need? Hence the birth of
the 3 IN I EDITOR.
3 IN I consists of a
sprite editor that has
provision for multicolour
and hi-res sprites. Sprites
can be animated, copied,
positioned on top of each
other etc. Within the
program there is also a
combined character and
background editor. What
makes this part of the
program so special is that
you are not limited to
designing just single
screens but it is possible to
deﬁne screens that take up
ro 32K of the computer's
memory.
The editing screens act
as a small window that
can be moved over a
much larger area, Until
now most scrolling screens
were designed as
individual pictures and
'stud< one next to the
other or a later date.
The 3 IN I EDITOR has
already aroused much
interest in programming
circles and many
programmers are using it
to help them design
games. The complete
editor program is on the
tape so that iris available
to anyone who is
interested in graphics.
Using the Program
Once you have loaded
the program and started it
running, (with SYS 51500)
you will be presented with
the editor's main menu
which offers the following
options:
1 ) SPRITE EDITOR
2) CHAR/SCREEN EDITOR
3) DISK COMMANDS
4) D1R
5) DISK REPORT
6) SAVE EDITOR
7) LOAD
Pressing the
corresponding key will call
up the speciﬁed function.
Options 1 and 2 call up
the sprite editor and the
character/background
editor respectively. These
will be explained in their
own sections later on.
Option 3 allows you to
send the standard disk

which combination of dots

Simply press one to three
to select the editing colour
and, hey presto!, draw dots
with it.
Colour changing is also
extremely easy, Press shift

corresponding colour will
go through all 16
possibilities. Changing
colour mode is also
extremely easy, choose
the option required from
the menu (F7). If you want
to reverse the sprite simply
press CONTROL AND R.
Easy isn't it?
It's not really worth
mentioning all of the
available commands since
they are all listed in Figure
2, However, a few
functions do need further
explanation.
At the bottom right
hand corner of the screen
there are four sprites
referred to as sprites zero
To three. Note these are
OT the same as sprite
umbers but are just used
es reference numbers for
four at the bottom of
screen. Usually these
four positions hold the
some sprites as that which
is being edited. Iris
possible to expand these
sprites using the pull down
menu. To alter the way
that the sprite looks simply
select the desired option
from the menu followed
by the corresponding sprite
position number (00-03).
Choosing POSITION
m the menu followed
by a number allows you to
move that numbered
sprite around the bottom
of the screen. This means
that you can position the
four sprites next to each
other or even overlap
them. This may not seem
all that useful at ﬁrst but it is
possible to make each of
these four sprites different.
This means that you could
deﬁne a large character of
up to four sprites joining
the sprites together at the
bottom of the screen so
that you can see what they
look like. It is even possible
to animate this section of
the screen with the
number option and the Q
and \V keys. Choosing
NUMBER followed by 00
will cause each of the four
sprites at the bottom of the
screen to become the
some as the one being
edited. If on the other
hand after you enter a
number greater than 00
you can set up animations.
Animation is quite
difﬁcult to explain and is
best ﬁgured out with
practice. However I will do
my best to explain how to
set up and use this special
animation function.
When you enter o
number greater than 00
for the number of
animations after choosing
NUMBER the sprires at the
bottom of the screen will
change. If, for example,
we hove enterd 01 and
the current sprite was SAO,
sprite 0 would be the
same cis the actual sprite

SAO. Sprite 01 will will be
the some as SAI, Sprite 02
Will be the same as 5A2
etc. If we now press the
keys \V and Q we can
increment and decrement
the sprite numbers at the
bottom of the screen g i g
the appearance of
animation. If we press 'W',
Sprite 00 will become
actual sprite SAI, Sprite .01
will become actual sprite
$A2 etc. If we hod entered
04 after a CONTROL N
instruction then the sprites
would be incremented by
four every time you
pressed the 'W key, i.e.
sprite 00 would bec ome
5A4, Sprite 01 would
become 5A5 etc.
I did say that this form
of animation was
complicated but if you try
it then I'm sure that it will
fall into place.
Just in case you have
problems with this type of
animation there is o
simpler form. This is the
ANIMATE instruction. This
instruction will change all
the sprites on the screen,
including the large editing
screen, in increments of
one for a preset length.
When you choose ANIMATE
you will be prompted at
the top of the screen for
the ﬁrst sprite in the
sequence and the last,
then the sprites will be
displayed in order. Pressing
'F' and 'S' will speed up
and slow down the speed
of this animation.
The sprite that is in the
editing window can be
moved within the editing
grid with the keys speciﬁed
elsewhere in this article.
If WRAP-ON is set what
disappears off of one
edge of the editing grid
will appear at the opposite
edge. If WRAP-ON is set
then anything moved off
the grid is lost.
Charoaers and
Sprites
The option that moy seem
a little strange is the ability
to turn characters into
sprites. The pull down
menu option CHAR-BANK
is used to specify which
character bank you want
to look at. Should you
wont the normal
Commodore characters
then enter D000 or the
prompt.
COPY CHARS is used to
position the desired
characters in the sprite grid,,_CharasterSereen
When this option is
selected a large square
will appear in the sprite
editing grid. This con be
moved within the grid
using the cursor keys. Once
you have the block where
you want your character to
appear press RETURN. You,
will then be prompted for'
the character that you
wont to appear in the
sprite. Try this using the
character set at D000 and
you'll soon see what this
option does. Use RUN,/
STOP to exit the COPY
CHARS option.
All change
It is possible to change one
multi colour to another
with the SWAP COLOUR
option on the pull down
menu. When selected this

Quite a lot of
information is present on
this screen and it is worth
• studying the commented
picture in order to ﬁnd
where everything is.
Again it is worth looking
or some of the available
commands in more detail,
a summary of them all
can be found in Figure 3,
As with the sprite editor,
characters can be edited in
either multi-colour or hi-res
mode, colours being
chosen and changed as in
the sprite editor.
Once you have
entered a character you
can place it anywhere
within a deﬁned
background in the
background editor. The
key is used to move
memory available for the
dow though I'm sure
that you will ﬁnd that you
very rarely use this much.
The two numbers in the
middle of the screen, otter
the word DATA, show you
where your window starts
and ﬁnishes in memory.
One very important
consideration for games
programmers is where
they ore octually going to
put their screen. The BASE
ADDRESS option will
prompt you for the base
address of the background
so that you con move it
where you want. Do make
sure that you don't
overwrite any other
programs in memory, such
as the editor.
You may think that it is
a little limiting to just see a
small section of your total
graphics screen ot one
time. I have therefore
included the '\V
command which will
switch to a full screen
display in which you can
move around the
background, movement
being controlled by the
cursor keys only.
It is possible to set up a
border character which is
displayed around the
smaller editing window. I
usually leave this blank
though you may try
different effects by pufﬁng
fancy borders around the
screen. This does not apply
to full screen mode.

is available that will allow
you to grab a rectangular
area of the backdrop and
copy it to another position

Saving and
Loading
As I said eotiler, it is
possible to load any type i
of ﬁle into memory from
the main main menu. It is also
possible to load any type
of ﬁle from within any of
the other editors as well_
However the I/O device is
you must change it in each 111
section of the program. : -
Even though you can
LOAD in any type of data
from within any section of
the program, you can only
save each type of data
from the correct editor.
You must therefore be in
the character editor in
order to SAVE your user
deﬁned graphics. You must
be in the background
editor in order to save
backgrounds. re
Note A
tfk
When you design a
background, make sure
that you keep a note of
the screen size that is
deﬁned, since a screen
thot is supposed to be 20
characters wide will look
rather silly if the screen is
set to 21 characters.
That just about sums it
up for the sprite editor. I'm
sure that you will ﬁnd it
very easy to use with a
lithe practice and that you
will ﬁnd most of the
k
ery likely to need,

your dorsals are fully
functional. Purple Fish Lord of
Czar here. Actually my great
eminence is not with you in that
sense, but the armies of the Fish Lord
will be with you soon. Thanks to last
months outrage by your Earthlings,
expect to see the assembled might
of Czar appearing in your skies
shortly. I compute that in exactly
one year from now the bowls of
heaven will descend upon the so-
called Hemel of Hempstead, and
totally exterminate the Henderson
of YC infamy. Until that glorious day,
here is the latest news from bowls
around the country.
The Bitmap Brothers have started
work upon Speedball 2, although
whether they will actually do any of
the work this time (they didn't do
any programming on Xenon II)
remains to be seen. The sequel to
the game of steel ﬁsts and high
speed thuggery is due for release in
September. Before then their current
project, Cadaver will be out in
August.
Cadaver is a pretty dim name
for a game, which is surprising since
Mirrorsoft rejected the ﬁrst suggestion
by the Bitmapping Boys. They
wanted to call it Stiffy. The
marketino plugs for this could have
been legion. Got a Stiffy, waggle
your joystick.'
Ocean Software is ofﬁcially
denying that it has its eye on the
latest game from Taito Line of Fire
This follows on from Operation Wolf

and Thunderbolt and features yet
more 3-D machine gunning, but
thankfully with some variety. When
pressed (up against a wall), PR girlie
Pam Grifﬁths giggled, "Oooh, I
suppose if it comes up then we'll
have to have it won't we."
Purveyor of graphically splendid
software, Psygnosis is worried at the
moment thanks to the collapse of
C.55 was an American distributor
that handled only games, and was
Psygnosis' main US distributor. The
company has crashed and the
receiver been called in
You would have thought that
there were enough computer
mogazines to ﬁll a truck with at the
moment, though the number may
decrease shortly having counted the
number of pages in certain 8-bit
magazines recently. However,
tadpoles on the scene hove
conﬁrmed that there is to be yet
another magazine joining the fray,
this one under the cumbersome title
of The Complete Beginner's Guide
to Games on Home Computers'.
There will be more words in the title
than adverts in the glossy magazine,
which is expected to retail for
around 6295. Expect the name to
be cur down to size when someone
realises how silly it is.
A ﬁnal maggot for you Earthies,
the main programming DDT has
resurfaced after months of silence.
Apparently his computer broke
down. For months?
Gloopl Until the great bowl in the
sky has revolved another 30 times,
fare thee well ﬁsh lovers.
