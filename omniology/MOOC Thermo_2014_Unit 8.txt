Unit 8 – segment 1 – Air standard power cycles – the Brayton cycle 

So you want to build a cogeneration 
plant, what are some of the 
important issues you need to 
consider?  
Heat cannot be efficiently 
transported large distances. 
Your system is unlikely to meet both 
your heating and electrical needs 
exactly.  You need to consider your 
best targets.

Component analysis 
Cycle efficiency 

Air standard power cycles - the Brayton cycle – part 2.   
•
Cycle efficiency increases with increasing burner operating pressure (just like Rankine cycle). 
•
Compressor work is a much higher fraction of the turbine work compared to pump work in a 
Rankine cycle (back work ratio). 
•
Reheat and intercooling can improve the Brayton cycle efficiency. 
•
There is a lot of useful heat going “out the stack” with the basic Brayton cycle… 

Operating strategies for combined heat and power applications are based on 
optimizing the system to best meet the thermal and electrical needs.  If the 
energy needs for this company correspond to the dashed lines in the figure, 
which of the operating point, A, B, C, or D, is best for this system?  
 
  
  

Unit 8 – segment 2 – more waste heat recovery: combined cycles 

Operating strategies for combined heat and power 
applications are based on optimizing the system to best 
meet the thermal and electrical needs.  If the energy 
needs for this company correspond to the dashed lines 
in the figure, which of the operating point, A, B, C, or D, 
is best for this system?  
 
Ideally the CHP system would meet the electrical and heat needs exactly.  
However, none of the operating points meet that target.  We do not want to 
exceed heating needs, as the excess heat would just be wasted (i.e. rejected to 
the environment).  That eliminates points A and B from consideration.  If we 
generate excess electricity, the company could, in principle sell the power back 
to the grid; however, this is only cost effective if the sale of the electricity is 
greater than the costs of the natural gas to power the turbine (plus operating 
and maintenance costs).  In addition, point C will require a larger turbine and 
capital outlay initially.  Consequently, D is the best of the choices provided.   
 
  
  

Combined cycles – the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. 

Combined cycles – the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. 
More than 20% of the U.S. total energy use in 1997 was wasted in thermal losses from power plants.  That is enough 
energy to power almost all of the transportation sector.

Comparing power plants 
•
Generating power always creates heat. 
•
In combined heat and power/co-generation plants, the heat transfer 
is a desired product of the cycle, in addition to the work out.  
•
CHP can be used at any scale – industrial power plants to I.C. engines 
and fuel cells.   
•
But the heat transfer application needs to be co-located with the 
power source.  Heat cannot be transferred large distances without 
incurring high losses. 
•
Combined cycle power plants are an obvious means to recover waste 
heat, but they require a lot of expensive capital equipment.

True or False.  Fossil fuel reserves are scarce.

True or False.  Fossil fuel reserves are scarce. 
False. 
Global Reserves/Production (R/P) = 42 years for oil, 64 
years for gas, and 160 years for coal.   
For US, R/P = 12 years for oil, 10 years for gas, and 240 
years for coal.

What is the impact of burning fossil fuels? 
After Dr. David L. Greene, Corporate Fellow,  Oak Ridge National Laboratory, “Transportation 
Energy Policy Issues for the 21st Century,” BES Workshop on Basic Research Needs for Clean and 
Efficient Combustion of 21st Century Transportation Fuels, October 30, 2006. 
Accessing the non-traditional fossil fuels for energy use will release over 100 times the carbon 
loading into the environment compared to ALL the oil reserves. 
It appears that the use of fossil fuels will continue until cost-effective alternatives are available. 
There are two parts to the cost-effective equation. 
 
1.  fossil fuel prices can increase (due to economic drivers, as oil prices did in 2008 causing changes 
in energy use behaviors; or due to legislated control e.g. fuel taxes, carbon credits, cap and trade 
programs, etc.). 
 
2.  the energy costs of alternatives to fossil fuels can decrease. 
 

Comparing energy density 
Hydrogen has the highest energy 
density, on a per mass basis. 
The challenges for battery applications 
in the transportation sector are clear. 

Comparing energy density 
But hydrogen has a low energy density, 
on a per volume basis. 
Liquid fuels have become the energy 
carriers for the transportation sector 
due to their high volumetric and 
specific energy properties. 

For the transportation 
sector, the goal is to be in 
the northeast quadrant of 
the energy density map. 

Solar and geothermal energy carriers have vast resources, but they are 
diffuse energy sources that require “densifying” or concentrating. 
The Earth intercepts a huge amount of solar radiation each year: 
 
solar flux = solar constant = 1.377 kW/m2 outside the atmosphere 
 
solar constant  × Aearth, projected =  sc(πr2
earth) = 1.73×1014 kW  5.4×1024 J/yr 
Annual global energy demand = 3.8×1020 J/yr  
 
⇒ Solar energy is over 10,000 times larger than the global needs!!! 
Estimates of recoverable geothermal energy using enhanced geothermal systems are huge!  
Some say over 13 million exajoules (1 exajoule = 1018 J) of thermal energy.  The total 
energy consumption in the U.S. in 2005 was 100 EJ. 
⇒ Geothermal energy is over 100,000 times larger than the U.S. needs!!! 
 

Renewables will play an important role in our global energy future.  
Improving the efficiencies of combustion of fossil, alternative and 
renewable fuels will play an important role in our global energy 
future. 
Conservation efforts will ALSO play an important role in our global 
energy future.   
 Turn out the lights, turn up/down the thermostat, carpool, put on a 
sweater, ride a bike to work.  These energy savings matter. 
 
Thank you and good luck on all your energy projects!
