explains how to stop the web using what
you do online to get the measure of you

to start the year right is delete your Google

Amazon to stuff its ‘recommendations’.

Amazon study our online activities,
monitoring the sites we visit and the
things we ‘like’ to build a profile of our

behind this data-processing is very clever,
I do wonder about its accuracy. Just

or some, 2016 has been a year to
forget but, perhaps surprisingly,
the death and destruction that
has hallmarked the past 12 months
hasn’t been entirely at the forefront
of our minds. Google has released
its annual Year In Search data,
which reveals that the two most
searched-for queries of 2016 were
“What is Pokémon Go?” and
“How to play Pokémon Go”.
The game also topped global
trending searches, although here in
the UK it was trumped by Euro 2016.
Donald Trump was our fourth most
searched-for term, just behind the late
David Bowie. Meanwhile, Prince,
Brexit, Alan Rickman, Olympics, US
election and Deadpool made up the
remaining top 10.
The search terms are always a good
gauge of our collective mindset as
well as our likes and dislikes. We

the UK’s most searched-for woman in
2016, even though we’ve only really

We highlight 10 of the most amazing and amusing things
you can do on the web this fortnight

Need to Know
8 30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017
What happened?
A new twist on ransomware attacks
has made the cybercrime even more
spiteful. In this version, the attackers
offer to unlock their victims’ PC for
free if they infect two of their
friends – or perhaps someone
they like a little less.
The Popcorn Time malware
may sound like a night at the
cinema – and the name is
identical to a video-streaming
BitTorrent app – but it’s far from
entertaining. Once your computer
is infected, the malicious program
encrypts all the files on your hard
drive so you can’t access them. The
attackers then demand a ransom
payment via Bitcoin.
That’s the standard method of
ransomware, but this is where Popcorn
Time applies its killer blow. You’re
effectively offered a deal with the devil:
if you don’t want to pay the unlocking
ransom, you can infect other people
instead. If two of the subsequent
victims pay their ransoms, then you’ll
get off without paying – like a pyramid
scheme for hackers. It’s not yet clear if
the offer is genuine or whether anyone
has taken the hackers up on it.
The hackers state that they are a
group of computer-science students
from Syria who are raising funds for aid
in the troubled country. Neither claim
has been confirmed, and there are
surely better ways to support the
people of Syria than risking your data –
perhaps consider donating to the Red
Cross instead.
How will it affect me?
If you’re downloading and installing the
legitimate (if legally dubious) Popcorn
Time app, double- and triple-check that
it’s the right one, so you don’t fall foul
of this ransomware.
Searching for Popcorn Time in Google
reveals a host of websites claiming to
offer the app for download. That’s
because the software was made
open-source to ensure it stayed free
to use and couldn’t be shut down by
copyright complaints. However, this
means it’s difficult to tell which version
is ‘genuine’, and there are rumours
online that some editions are run by
copyright authorities in the US.
In other words, do your research and
be wary when downloading Popcorn
Time. If in any doubt, stick with legal
paid-for services such as Netflix or
Amazon Prime.
As ever, the best way to avoid trouble
with ransomware is to not get infected
in the first place, so make sure you’re
running antivirus software, keep
your operating system up to date,
and use common sense online.
It’s also sensible to keep your data
backed up, which is good advice
to follow for a host of PC-related
problems. If your data is backed
up, you won’t have to pay a ransom
or sell out your friends to get it back.
If you are unfortunate (or careless)
enough to become the victim of a
ransomware infection, there’s no
guarantee that paying the fee will see
your data released. If the attackers are
unscrupulous enough to lock your files
in the first place, it’s unlikely they’ll
honour their promise to unlock them.
What do we think?
Ransomware is already the most vicious
form of cybercrime around. If a hacker
steals someone’s payment-card details,
it’s only their cash they’re after, which
will probably be reimbursed by their
bank. But ransomware holds your data
hostage, whether that’s your family
photos, the novel you’ve been writing
for years or your carefully curated music
collection. Our computers are
repositories for much that we hold dear,
and – for that reason – you should back
up your data regularly.
We sincerely hope no one takes the
hackers up on the offer of infecting
a friend’s (or anyone else’s) computer.
Although we’re grudgingly impressed
by the devious idea of abusing social
trends, using the same techniques as
a clickbait site trying to make a story
go viral, we wish it was genuinely for
a good cause rather than for
a ransomware attack. We’re hoping the
methods used to spread this infection
don’t catch on, because it’s hard enough
to trust websites as it is, let alone
introduce doubt about links shared by
our friends, family and contacts who
may secretly wish to do us harm.

Need to Know
What happened?
Microsoft has finally
launched its digital
assistant Cortana on
Android (and soon iOS)
in the UK. The release
comes more than a year
after a similar rollout in
the US, and features a
revamped design that
includes full-page answers
and weather information
on the landing page.
You can ask Cortana to
send emails, make calls,
open apps and more,
without having to type
a word, and you can get
recommendations for
nearby places to eat, shop
and stay. The app also
brings phone notifications
to your PC, so you can see
when you’ve missed a call
or received a text.
The app means mobile
users in the UK will have
another digital assistant to
choose from. Like Google
Assistant and Apple’s Siri,
Cortana can be accessed
hands-free using voice
commands but the only
phones it was built into
were Windows Phones.
How will it affect you?
If you’re an avid Windows
10 user, this will be
Cortana comes to
Android and iOS
welcome news. Cortana is
synced across devices –
including desktops, laptops
and the Xbox One – and
the latest rollout looks
to be a continuation of
Microsoft’s general
cross-platform Windows 10
strategy. The company also
claims that the app is faster
than its previous iteration.
For non-Windows 10
users, however, Cortana
has to compete against
an increasingly crowded
digital-assistant market
that not only includes
Google and Apple’s
offerings, but also
Amazon’s Alexa.
What do we think?
Considering that the first
thing many new Windows
10 users do is turn Cortana
off, we find it difficult to
get too excited about the
voice assistant coming to
Android and iOS, especially
because those platforms
already have their own
equivalents. However,
if you hate typing and
don’t feel foolish asking
your phone to do things for
you, then the app is
certainly worth a look.
For our part, we’ll be
sticking with “OK Google”.
What
happened?
Windows XP
is still in
widespread
use
throughout
the NHS,
two-and-a-
half years
after
Microsoft
dropped support for the
operating system,
according to a new survey.
Citrix, which commissioned
the survey, sent freedom-
of-information requests to
63 NHS trusts in the UK,
42 of which responded.
The gathered data revealed
that Windows XP was in
use at 90% of the trusts
questioned – albeit, in
some cases, only on a small
percentage of all devices.
The data also revealed
that 24 trusts are still
unsure as to when they will
migrate from Windows XP
to a newer operating
system. Windows XP was
introduced in 2001 and
hasn’t received official
security updates since
April 2014, but it remains in
use across the world
despite a significant effort
from Microsoft to persuade
organisations to move to
Windows 7, 8 or 10.
Around one in 10 (14%)
of the trusts surveyed
indicated that they would
be transitioning to a new
operating system by the
end of 2016, while nearly
a third (29%) claimed they
will be making the move
in 2017.
NHS Trusts
still use
Windows XP
How will it affect you?
Naturally, your first
concern will be about the
safety of your medical
records, but bear in mind
that the NHS Trusts only
admitted to using Windows
XP on some devices – not
across their entire
computer network.
Nevertheless, with hackers
increasingly picking new
targets to steal data from
and expose for their lax
security, you’d be within
your rights to ask your
doctor which operating
system their organisation
is using.
What do we think?
In a few months’ time,
Windows XP will have been
unsafe to use for three
years, so we’re dismayed
that the NHS has yet to
upgrade all its computers
– even if only a small
number are at risk. At the
same time, we recognise
the expense of testing and
switching to a modern
operating system on
millions of devices. We can
only hope that, in the
meantime, the NHS is
protecting patients’ data
with effective encryption.

7
MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTIONS FOR 2017
It’s set to be another interesting year for the internet. Here are the
questions we’re asking about the next 12 months in tech
3
Will TalkTalk or another
big ISP be hacked?
Long answer:
TalkTalk wasn’t
the only big UK
company to be
targeted by hackers in 2015, but it
suffered one of the largest attacks.
More than 150,000 customers’
details were leaked, and the
company was hit with a £400,000
fine in 2016. The hack will have cost
the ISP even more in lost customers
and other damages.
The attack wasn’t the result of
online terrorists or organised
criminals – one of the hackers was a
17-year-old boy who used long-
standing vulnerabilities to target
TalkTalk; the other was a 19-year-old
who demanded a ransom payment in
Bitcoin. If it’s so easy to hack a target
as lucrative as TalkTalk that
teenagers do it in their spare time,
then it’s likely to happen again – if
not to TalkTalk, which has hopefully
patched its vulnerabilities, then to
another tech company that hasn’t
yet got the message.
Short answer:
Undoubtedly.
2
Will the Snooper’s Charter
be repealed?
Long answer:
The Investigatory Powers Bill is only
the latest incarnation of the so-
called Snooper’s Charter, giving
security authorities – and many
other governmental bodies – access
to our web-browsing records. The
bill has been given Royal Assent
after passing through both houses
of Parliament, meaning it will pass
into law. Because of that, there are
not likely to be many changes to the
document itself in 2017.
However, activists, security
researchers, academics and many
more disagree with the law and will
keep close watch on how it’s
used, meaning a legal
challenge could be
looming. We may not
see the Snooper’s
Charter fully
repealed, but its
worst intrusions could
be blunted in court.
Short answer:
No, but legal challenges could limit
its powers. See our FAQ on page 36
for more details.
4
Will Facebook fix its
fake-news problem?
Long answer:
The Brexit referendum and US
election highlighted a problem with
using Facebook to get your daily
news: much of it is fake. Some
experts believe the level of fake
news on the social network may have
influenced the outcome of the
presidential race, though it’s difficult
to measure – not least when so
many “real” news organisations are
less than straight in their reporting.
Facebook has since launched a
reporting tool, so users can tell it
when a site posts fake news, but it’s
hard to believe that’s going to solve
the problem, not least
because fake news is
not only a technical
challenge but a
cultural one. Blocking
links to dodgy sites is
easy, but answering
the backlash to cries
of “censorship” will be much
tougher. Facebook has a difficult
year ahead of it.
Short answer:
It will try but probably fail.
10 30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017
1
Will we see driverless cars
on our roads?
Long answer:
Hand over the car keys and let
artificial intelligence (AI) take the
wheel as you sit back and enjoy the
ride. As appealing as that sounds,
you’ll have to wait some time
before automated chauffeuring is
ready for the masses. Despite the
hype from companies such as
Google and Tesla, the systems that
drive the cars need more work – as
do the regulations around them.
That said, there will be some
driverless cars on the roads of
Britain in 2017 because academics
from universities will be running
public trials and car manufacturers
such as Volvo will be conducting
tests. But unless you’re part of the
research study, the only way to hit
the road without taking the wheel
is to let another human drive – so
hang onto your bus pass in 2017.
Short answer:
You’ll be stuck driving your
commute for the foreseeable
future, but trials of automated cars
will hit British roads in 2017.

5
Will smart-home
assistants take off?
Long answer:
In 2016, Amazon and Google
both started selling home
speakers with built-in voice-
activated assistants that can
answer our spoken queries
about cinema listings, the
weather and when the next bus
is due to arrive. The Google
Home device is yet to arrive on
these shores, but many Brits
have already welcomed
Amazon’s Echo and its Alexa
assistant into their homes.
It’s tough to predict which
technology will last while others
fail, but there’s a key factor to
look for when gazing into a
crystal ball: is the new gadget
actually useful? Smartwatches
clearly weren’t, and sales
subsequently struggled.
Smart-home assistants let you
set your phone aside at home
and free you from staring at a
screen. That’s handier than a
smartwatch, at least.
Short answer:
Alexa and friends will last longer
than wearables.

Will Uber and Airbnb
face regulation?
Long answer:
Uber and Airbnb are the leading
proponents of the so-called ‘sharing
economy’, and their peer-to-peer
models make them harder to regulate
and tax than more traditional
companies. They are likely to face
increasing regulation – though it’s unlikely that
any new laws or rules will be significant enough to put either out of business.
Airbnb has agreed to limit hosts to 90 days of lets – the legal limit without a
permit. That’s not a change in law, but it shows Airbnb would rather help enforce
existing laws than tempt regulators to write stronger ones. Some Uber drivers have
complained that they don’t make minimum wage despite working full-time hours,
and have taken their case to the courts. Depending on the outcome, this could
force sharing-economy customers to top up workers’ pay, cutting into the cost
savings that made the platform so attractive to users in the first place.
Short answer:
Changes loom, but the sharing economy is here to stay.
7
Will BT and Openreach have
an amicable divorce?
Long answer:
Ofcom wants telecoms giant BT to separate from Openreach, its broadband-
infrastructure arm, to open up access to its services and equipment to rival ISPs,
who can use its network of poles, ducts and so on to roll out their own fibre-
broadband services. The divorce has been a long time coming, and likely won’t run
smoothly – BT isn’t keen on the change but rival ISPs are hoping to push it along as
quickly as possible. That said, BT will still own Openreach but will be legally
separated from it, so the change may not prove all that painful in the end.
Expect a year of negotiations, consultations and legal challenges, as Ofcom
hasn’t yet filed its formal notification to the European
Commission to start the process, meaning BT could still
convince the regulator to give it more time to prove
its current setup isn’t hurting competition.
Short answer:
Nothing broadband-related runs
smoothly in Britain, so don’t expect
the Openreach spinoff to be any
different.

Q
Following the
recent hack of
TalkTalk routers,
how can big internet
companies avoid being
hacked again in 2017?
Liam Potts, Facebook
A
The lessons that
should be learned
from the recent
Android malware targets
1 million Google accounts
More than one million Google
accounts have been
compromised by a new
authentication-thieving
malware campaign called
Gooligan, according to
security company Check Point.
In a blog post, Check Point said the
malware steals authentication tokens
from infected Android devices, which
can later be used to access Google
services such as Play, Gmail, Photos,
Google Drive and more. The Gooligan
malware campaign appears to affect
74% of in-market devices, particularly
those running Android 4 (JellyBean,
KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop). Around 57%
of these devices are in Asia and 9%
are in Europe. Android users can
check whether their account is
compromised at gooligan.checkpoint
.com. If your account has been
breached, you should carry out a
Mirai attacks against more
than 100,000 TalkTalk and
Post Office routers is to
recognise just how
vulnerable companies are
as a result of their own
laziness. Sure, they can
blame harried consumers for
treating their home routers
and Internet of Things
gadgetry – such as toasters
and other kitchen appliances
– like any other appliance,
by just plugging them in and
forgetting about them. But
what excuse do professionals
working in the technology
field have for this rookie-level
behaviour? Not much!
Unfortunately, ‘default-itis’
still plagues many large
organisations.
Hackers typically scan for
public ports and are able to
guess weak passwords that
were never changed from the
default or were created for
convenience such as
‘admin1234’. This is exactly
the technique that was used
in the Mirai botnet attack.
Even if hackers use other
methods to infiltrate a
network – such as phishing
– they can still take
advantage of internal
software for which default
logins were never changed.
You have to plan for
attackers breaching the
first line of defences, and
therefore have in place
security controls to
monitor and detect
intruders. In a way, we
should be thankful for the
‘script kiddies’ who
launched the Mirai botnet
DDoS (direct denial of
service) attack. It’s a great
lesson for showing that
companies should be
looking inward when
planning their data security
to protect themselves and
their customers.

Dailymotion hack exposes 85
million users
A hack on the popular
video-sharing site
Dailymotion has exposed
millions of account details,
with email addresses and usernames
reportedly leaked online. More than 85
million accounts were compromised in
the attack, 18.3 million of which had
associated passwords, according to
LeakedSource (leakedsource.com), a
security-breach notification website that
revealed the attack took place on 20
October. Although the passwords were
‘hashed’ – or jumbled – to prevent
attackers reading them easily, users may
become vulnerable to targeted phishing
scams. LeakedSource, which also
discovered a recent hack on
AdultFriendFinder, said the identity of
the person behind the latest attack is
currently unknown.

Personal passwords being
reused at work
More than one in four
UK workers admit to
using the same
passwords for their
work and personal
accounts, potentially putting their
employers’ data at risk. A survey of
over 1,000 UK office workers
conducted by YouGov, on behalf of
encryption firm WinMagic, revealed
that employees’ lax attitude to
cybersecurity and data protection
could be opening up huge security
holes in their companies’ networks.
Password reuse is a huge issue for
cybersecurity, and the habit has played
a part in many breaches, including
a recent spate of Deliveroo hacks.

Action for Elders runs weekly
programmes to help older people gain
new skills, encourage exercise and enjoy

drop-down menus, with a photo-led
layout that’s easy to get around. The site
promotes volunteer opportunities,
showing how it positively affects people’s

Great new free WordPress
themes
Why not treat your website to
a new theme for the new year?
Themeisle (themeisle.com) has
just launched three excellent
themes that are available free
of charge. Naturelle (bit.ly/nat413)
uses vertical scrolling to create
stunning single-page sites with
great-looking designs. ReviewZine
(bit.ly/review413) is a framework
for building a review site, aimed
at technology reviews but easily
adapted to other types. And if
you’re thinking of setting up
a shop, try Azera Luxury
(bit.ly/az413).
WordPress.com users shouldn’t
feel left out because the service
has its own free new theme called
Ixion (bit.ly/ix413), specifically
designed for organisations like
clubs that need sites with both
permanent information and
regularly updated news.
WordPress 4.7 launches
If you haven’t already done so,
you need to pop into your
WordPress website’s Dashboard
and manually upgrade it to
version 4.7. As well as the new
default theme (Twenty Seventeen,
which we looked at in issue 411 –
bit.ly/webuser411), the latest
update also includes a
customisation tool that makes it
easier to rearrange your content
in themes, and a menu-building
tool that allows you to create
pages on the fly. You can also
now see a live preview of what
your site will look like if you tweak
its CSS settings.
1
Sign in with your Google account
and select the Property (website)
you want to look at. If you don’t already
have one registered, you can click the
‘Add property now’ button. The main
screen charts how many times people
have clicked through to your site, 1
and lists the search terms they were
looking for. 2

Click a specific search term in the list
and it will be used as a filter. 1 You
can use other filters to view different
subsets of results, 2 including specific
pages, the countries that the search
originated from and the device type
(desktop, mobile or tablet) that the
searcher used.

You’ll also find useful statistics from
the different options above the
filters. Tick the boxes to add them to
your chart. As well as the total clicks,
you can view the number of times your
site was displayed by Google
(‘impressions’), 1 the average click-

Q
What should I add to my HTML
<img> tags to increase my SEO
(search-engine optimisation):
‘alt=’, ‘title=’ or both?
Gary Fender, via email
A
When a search engine is crawling
your site and finds an image, it will
focus on the ‘alt’ attribute to
understand what the image is about.
Descriptive keyword-focused ‘alt’ attributes
are beneficial from an SEO perspective, but
you shouldn’t ignore title attributes.
Although they aren’t as valuable for SEO,
image titles are still useful to users and are
an integral part of good web design.
The words in the title tag will pop up as
a tool tip when you hover your mouse
over an image.

It’s tempting to think that your anti-
virus is all you need to stay safe, but
recent hacks have shown that you
require extra layers of defence. In
October hackers used the deadly Mirai
botnet to take down thousands of
websites worldwide. What made it a
particularly devastating attack is that it
exploited flaws in web-connected
devices, such as webcams, routers,
printers and even baby monitors. Unlike
your computer, these devices AREN’T
protected by your anti-virus. You need a
different, better security solution to stay
safe in the future.
The answer is to use managed security from
leading UK firm Idappcom (http://
idappcom.com). It provides business-
strength security for your home, protecting
all your devices: webcams, printers, routers
- as well as PCs, laptops, tablets, Smart TVs
and phones.
MANAGED SECURITY IN
YOUR HOME
What does ‘managed’
security mean? Well, it
simply takes the worry
out of staying safe.
Instead of wondering
when you should
update your anti-virus, just let a cloud-based
security operations centre take control.
Manned by dedicated professionals, this
centre monitors your security 24/7,
updating your software when required. It’s
like having your own private army of
security experts protecting you from
hackers and scammers.
All you need
to do is
connect
Idappcom’s
HIPSY box
(pictured) to
your router.
This creates
a secure Wi-Fi hub for all your family’s
internet-connected devices, including PCs,
laptops, tablets, phones and smart devices,
protecting them from the latest exploits and
malware attacks.
MANAGED SECURITY
WHEREVER YOU ARE
But Idappcom’s security doesn’t end at your
front door. Slip Idappcom’s GIPSY box
(pictured) into your pocket and you’ll have
portable protection. Simply connect to your
laptop or tablet then to an available Wi-Fi
hotspot to create
a secure internet
connection
wherever you
are - on holiday,
in a hotel, or just
down the coffee
shop. With the GIPSY connected you can
safely use any shared internet connection
without worrying about who may be
eavesdropping or stealing your online ID.
With the HIPSY installed on your home
network you also have the option to create
restricted access-zones to protect younger
family members from inappropriate content
and social media bullying.
24/7 PROTECTION
How do you know
HIPSY and GIPSY
work? The clue is in
the name: IPS stands
for ‘Intrusion
Prevention System’ -
which is the industry-standard technology
used by businesses.
In fact, it’s not just businesses that use IPS.
The technology is so powerful that even the
Government and military use it. But until
now it’s not been affordable to the general
public. Idappcom’s ground-breaking service
finally means that you can enjoy the same
level of security that the authorities take for
granted.

W
e’ve seen a few
hybrid 2-in-1
devices that can
operate as both a laptop and
a tablet but the Yoga Book
is refreshingly different and
Lenovo has really pulled out
all the stops by completely
revolutionising the design
of this kind of device.
For starters, there’s no
physical keyboard. Instead
you get a virtual one, which
is illuminated and looks
convincingly futuristic.
The keys vibrate when you
tap them, giving you
a reassuring sense of
feedback as you type.
This isn’t merely aesthetic,
either, because the Yoga
Book’s real party trick is its
ability to turn that virtual
keyboard into a full-blown,
electromagnetic resonance
(EMR) writing surface. This
means you can draw or
scribble notes with its
bundled stylus at the tap of a
switch. Simply press the small
stylus button in the top-right
corner and the illuminated
keys disappear, giving you
a spacious area to write on.
It’s incredibly versatile.
The lack of physical keys
means Lenovo has also been
able to slim down the Yoga
Book’s aluminium
magnesium-alloy chassis to
a mere 9.6mm when closed,
making it the world’s thinnest
hybrid. Likewise, at just 690g,
the Yoga Book barely weighs
more than a high-quality
Lenovo Yoga Book
paper notebook, making it
incredibly easy to slot in your
bag and use on the go.
Keyboard and writing
surface
Admittedly, it takes a little
time and perseverance to get
used to typing on the virtual
keyboard. This review was
In theory, Lenovo’s artificial-
learning software should
mean that typing on the Yoga
Book improves over time. We
didn’t see much evidence of
this taking effect during our
tests but it’s meant to be able
to learn exactly where your
fingers land when you hit
certain keys and adjust its
active key area accordingly.
For instance, if you always hit
the spacebar below the
defined area allocated on the
keyboard, the Yoga Book
should remember and still
register the key press for you.
Turn the keyboard off,
Why choose between a tablet or a laptop when you can have
both? Nathan Spendelow looks at Lenovo’s latest 2-in-1 that
does more than a tablet but is lighter than a laptop
written on the Yoga Book’s
keyboard and while the first
draft was riddled with typing
errors and other mistakes, we
soon started to feel more
comfortable with it. Just don’t
expect to type very fast – we
found it couldn’t keep up the
pace as our typing speed
increased to full flow.

Despite a couple of niggles,
the Yoga Book is an
exceptional note-taking
device that, for £450, does
an excellent job of bridging
the gap between laptop,
tablet and paper notebook.
Lenovo has pushed the
boundaries and this
genuinely feels like a step
forward over the plethora
of Surface-alikes we’ve
seen in the past. However,
we’d advise that you try
the keyboard before you
buy, because the lack of
physical keys won’t be to
everyone’s liking.

though, and the Yoga Book
unequivocally excels as a
device for taking hand-written
notes. Using the stylus (which
has 2,048 levels of pressure
sensitivity) feels perfectly
natural. We much preferred it
to writing directly onto glass
and the keyboard’s built-in
palm rejection means you can
rest your hand on it as you
write without making any
random marks on the page,
and see exactly what you’re
writing on the screen above.
The smartest addition to
the Yoga Book is its bundled
magnetic clip. This lets you
clip any old A5 notebook to
the Yoga Book and still take
notes, giving you both a
physical version and a digital
copy to store or share. On the
Android model we were sent
for review, all notes were
instantly saved to Lenovo’s
own note-saving app; the
Windows version saves
everything to OneNote, so
you can instantly access your
digitised notes from any
Windows device via the cloud.
Screen and
performance
Given the fancy keyboard and
impressive stylus, the screen
is a bit disappointing. It’s a
10.1in, 1,920 x 1,200-pixels
panel, with a surprisingly
high maximum brightness
of 422cd/m2, but its overall
colour accuracy covered
just 81.2% of the colours
available to the sRGB colour
standard. This makes it an
inadequate tool for serious
graphic work, although it’s
perfectly capable of carrying
out less specialised tasks.
As previously mentioned,
there are two types of Yoga
Book available – an Android
version and a Windows 10 Pro
version, which costs £100
more. Both come with the
same hardware specifications,
including a quad-core Intel
Atom x5-Z8550 processor
clocked at 2.4GHz, with 4GB
of RAM. It’s not a particularly
fast combination by any
means, but it’s more than
enough for light computing
tasks on the move.
In Geekbench 4 (geekbench
.com), for instance, the Yoga
Book scored 3,222 in the
multi-core test and 1,162 in the
single-core test. This is low for
a laptop, but should serve you
well for general use. We didn’t
experience any noticeable
problems zipping around
multiple, less-demanding
Android applications – only
the keyboard occasionally
struggled to recognise our
top-speed typing.
Graphics performance falls
short of the latest cutting-
edge tablets, but the Yoga
Book’s average of 19fps in the
GFXBench Manhattan 3 test
(gfxbench.com) is still good,
putting it roughly on par with
one of last year’s top-range
smartphones. In practice,
running a graphically intense
game such as Sky Force
Reloaded (bit.ly/skyforce413)
was a little problematic, with
the occasional noticeable
frame drop whenever the
action got a little too frenetic.
However, simpler games ran
perfectly well.
Battery life is good, too.
With the screen brightness
set to our standard
measurement of 170cd/m2,
the Yoga Book lasted 7 hours
and 22 minutes in our
continuous video-playback
test. This means you’ll get a
good day’s use from it, even if
you aren’t able to access a
mains socket.
A natural downside of
having such a thin device is its
lack of ports. Still, the Yoga
Book tries its best and you
get a micro USB port, a micro
HDMI port for connecting it to
an external display, a microSD
port for adding storage and a
3.5mm headphone jack.
As for network connectivity,
there’s built-in 802.11ac
wireless, along with
Bluetooth 4, for hooking
up external peripherals.

The results speak for
themselves. The slower
your router, the bigger the
benefit from this kit. But
even with a reasonably
good router, you can
improve your Wi-Fi’s
performance in its weakest
blackspots around your
home. It’s an easy and
effective fix that can be up

Andy Shaw tests Devolo’s latest HomePlug kit, which brings
faster Wi-Fi to all corners of your home at an affordable price
The fastest the router could
manage to our distant room
was 2.44MB/s (megabytes
per second) while transferring
large video files on the 5GHz
network. It was slower when
transferring lots of photo files,
managing 1.72MB/s. The
2.4GHz network was slower,
mostly because it appeared
to be less reliable, averaging
out at 1.44MB/s when
comes with two devices: one
550+ duo (with two Ethernet
ports and a pass-through
socket) to connect to your
router; and a Wi-Fi unit
(which also has a pass-
through socket but only one
Ethernet port) to bring a
stronger Wi-Fi connection to
distant rooms.
As usual, setting the
devices up is easy. Plug the
device for the router into a
nearby socket (the power
outlet can still be used for
other devices, thanks to its
own pass-through socket)
and connect it to the router
using the supplied Ethernet
cable. Plug the other device
into another wall socket and
the two HomePlugs will find
each other and create a
network. A couple of button
pushes will secure it, and it
can automatically replicate
your router’s security settings
if you’d like a seamless
transfer between networks.
Performance
We connected a USB 3
portable SSD drive containing
a collection of video and
photo files to our existing
Linksys router (reviewed in
Issue 391 – bit.ly/issue391). We
timed how long it took to
transfer the files to a PC in the
furthest room away from the
router, one floor up in an
extension, which meant the
signal had to pass through a
ceiling and an external wall.
On the router, we tested both
2.4GHz and 5GHz networks,
though the Devolo device
only uses the 2.4GHz
frequency.
transferring videos, and
0.93MB/s with smaller files.
Things improved
significantly with the
HomePlugs installed: we
managed to transfer video
files at 2.99MB/s (22% faster
than the 5GHz network) and
the smaller photo files at
3.02MB/s (75% faster than the
router’s 5GHz network).
A marked improvement.
T
he latest addition to
Devolo’s HomePlug
range doesn’t claim to
bring the speediest Wi-Fi to
the difficult-to-reach corners
of your home, but it will
improve the signal at an
affordable price. If your
router isn’t especially fast
anyway – because you’re still
using the basic model
supplied by your ISP, for
example – this new 550+
Wi-Fi Starter Kit can bring a
significant improvement to
your home’s worst Wi-Fi
blackspots.
Sticking with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
technology and 100Mbps Fast
Ethernet rather than Gigabit
keeps the cost down. The kit

The program is completely free for
personal and non-commercial use,
and is really easy to set up – the entire
process takes seconds. If you ever need
remote access to another computer –
whether it’s yours or someone else’s
(with their permission, of course) –
then TeamViewer is by far the best
option around.
If someone you know is having PC
problems, you can use TeamViewer to
log into their computer remotely and
either fix the faults yourself without
having to be physically present or give
them an on-screen demonstration
to show them how it’s done.
You can also use the program to
access your own computer remotely
and drag files to and from it; host online
meetings; collaborate on documents in
real time; and watch videos or listen
to music stored on a remote system.
If you have a multi-monitor setup, you
can have different remote-connection
sessions open on each screen, and drag
and drop files between them.
The software automatically adjusts
the connection based on your hardware
and network to deliver the best quality,
and you can now leave sticky notes
behind on the remote computer – which
is useful for letting someone know that
you’ve finished fixing their PC.

This powerful media centre can play any
audio and video files on a Plex Media Server.
It was designed to run full-screen on
home-theatre systems and used to require
a Plex Pass – Plex’s premium subscription
service – but it’s now entirely free.
If you run Plex in a window on your

so you can use your mouse and keyboard
to watch content or manage your media

It cleverly reduces the amount of space that

instance of an attachment. All your emails are
saved in a central location and you can read,
search and consolidate them in the software,
or burn them to CD or DVD. MailStore Home
now fully encrypts all email databases, and
lets you password-protect archives so
nobody else can open them. Numerous
performance improvements have also been
made throughout.
VLC is undoubtedly the best free media

CHROME

30 30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017
Restart Chrome with a
single click
When Chrome goes wrong, restarting
it often fixes the problem, but there’s
no easy way to do this other than
closing the browser and reopening it.
One way around this problem is to
create a button that restarts Chrome
instantly with one click. You can do this
by making a bookmarklet for Chrome’s
‘chrome:restart’ page. On any web
page, click the bookmark (star) button
in your address bar or click Ctrl+D
to add a bookmark, then click Edit.
Change the name of the bookmark to
Restart Chrome (or similar) and enter
chrome:restart in the URL field.
Select the ‘Bookmarks bar’ in the list
below, click Save and drag the new
bookmark to your Bookmarks bar to
create a bookmarklet. You can now click
this whenever you need to restart
Chrome, with no messing around.
Many ad blockers now allow ‘acceptable
ads’, but a new Chrome extension called
Bad Ad Johnny (bit.ly/badad413)
refuses to indulge in such pussyfooting.
Described as “an ad blocker with swag”,
this combative add-on from the
PureVPN team demonstrates “extreme
hatred” for adverts and a “personal
vendetta” against malware by filtering
everything that could possibly annoy or
threaten you online. This includes video,
email, and overlay ads; web trackers
and data loggers; and unnecessary
scripts and malicious code. “Just turn
me on and forget about digital evils
forever”, boasts Johnny, although he’s
also flexible enough to let you disable
blocking on specific sites and target
individual elements rather than
everything on a page. Bad Ad Johnny
keeps count of everything he’s blocked,
and you can even follow his surprisingly
funny feed on Twitter @Badadjohnny.
What a guy!
CSTAR reached its
conclusion. We were
surprised to find that
even big names such as
Facebook, Amazon and
Google were weak in
certain areas.
You can also use the
tool without installing
the add-on by entering
a URL at www.upguard
.com/webscan.
Play Chrome’s
dinosaur game
online
We’ve written before
about the jumping-
dinosaur game you
can play when Chrome
loses its connection, but now you
can play it online, too. Just type
chrome:dino into the address
bar, press Enter and click the
dinosaur to begin. The feature
is currently only available in the
Canary version of the browser
(bit.ly/canary413), but should be
coming to the stable release soon.
Check the
security of
any website
Now that you can
no longer trust
Web of Trust with
your data, who
can you turn to
if you want to find
out if a website
is safe to use?
One contender
is a new tool from
security company
UpGuard (www
.upguard.com),
which uses the
company’s
CSTAR (Cyber
Security Threat
Assessment Report) technology to rate
the security of any site you visit. Install
the Chrome extension (bit.ly/cstar413),
then browse the web as usual but keep
an eye on the CSTAR button on your
toolbar. This displays Upguard’s risk
score for the site you’re viewing, based
on factors such as whether it uses
encryption, contains malicious code, has
an up-to-date security certificate and is
known to have exposed users’ email
accounts in a breach. The score is out
of 950, and the icon turns from green to
red if the site receives a poor
rating – or yellow if it’s merely
‘average’. You can view
detected ‘failures’ by clicking
the toolbar button followed by

Secure Firefox using a
password
Leaving your browser unattended is a
serious security risk – anyone can see
which sites you’ve visited, access your
accounts, change your settings and even
download malware. The best way to
protect Firefox from enemy interference
is to install the brilliant Master Password+
(bit.ly/master413). This lets you lock your
browser with – you guessed it – a master
password, either after it’s been idle for
a set period of time or when you trigger
the lock. You can also set it to ask for the
password whenever you launch Firefox. To set up Master Password+, press Alt+L
and enter the password you want to use. In the section below, you can set other
options such as how long the browser should wait before logging you out, as well
as keyboard shortcuts to lock windows and log in and out.
View random Wikipedia
pages in new tabs
We love wasting time with Wikipedia’s
‘Random article’ feature. Only this
morning we learned about the German
town of Bad Frankenhausen, waste
management in Bangladesh and a rare
species of violet. Now, a new Firefox
add-on brings such educational
surprises to your browser by displaying
random articles on your New Tab page.
Just install the snappily titled Random
Unusual Wikipedia New Tab (bit.ly/
random413) and when you need some
distraction, press Ctrl+T or click the new
tab button to see what pops up. You
can choose to view only ‘unusual’
random articles, or even pages about
philosophical concepts and cognitive
bias, if that’s what floats your boat!
Stop videos playing
automatically
Videos that play automatically are
annoying, especially when they’re loud,
but there are times – such as when
you’re browsing YouTube – when it’s
preferable for videos to start
Remove clutter
from web pages
Firefox recently
introduced a feature called
Reader View, which removes
ads, background images and
other distracting elements from
web pages to make them easier
to read and cheaper to print.
Opera doesn’t offer a built-in
equivalent, but you can add
Reader View to the browser
using a new add-on called,
unsurprisingly, Reader View
(bit.ly/reader413). Just click
the toolbar button to strip the
current page of all clutter, and
use the options at the side to
change the text size and
background colour.
Set Google as
Pale Moon’s
search engine
Now in its 27th version, Pale
Moon (www.palemoon.org) has
moved away from its Firefox-
based origins, and has also
ditched Google from its choice
of search engines. If you’re
unhappy about this but want to
keep using the browser, there’s
a simple workaround. Go to Pale
Moon’s Search Plugins page
(bit.ly/pale413), select Google
and, when the Add Search
Engine box opens, click Add.
If you want Google to be your
default search provider, tick the
box ‘Make this the current
search engine’ to change the
setting from DuckDuckGo.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
automatically. You can solve this
conundrum using Autoplay_away
(bit.ly/auto413), which makes it easy
to switch the auto-play setting on and
off. Rather than delving into Firefox’s
baffling ‘about:config’ section to find
the ‘media.autoplay.enabled’ entry,
you can simply click the add-on’s
toolbar button to toggle the setting
on and off instantly. It’s slightly
annoying that the button doesn’t
show the setting’s current status, but
it only takes one click to change it.
Compare prices across
Amazon sites
Are we paying more for Amazon
products than our European cousins?
Find out using Amazon EU: Price
Comparison (bit.ly/amazon413), which
compares the price of the item you’re
viewing with those in Amazon’s stores
in France, Germany, Spain and Italy.
The weak pound means prices tend
to be lower in the UK, but you can still
find the odd euro bargain.

App of the Fortnight
PHOTOS
PhotoScan
bit.ly/photo413

8.1
Google’s latest app
turns your phone or
tablet into a scanner for
digitising old photos.
Sound familiar? Well,
Photomyne (www
.photomyne.com),
CamScanner (www
.camscanner.com) and
Shoebox (shoebox
.ancestry.com) all scan
your dusty old family
photos, and they’re
currently free for
Android and iOS.
But PhotoScan’s
USP is that it
integrates with Google
Photos – a combined
storage service,
viewer and editor – which means
you can scan, edit and save unlimited photos for free,
without using up your Google storage allowance.
Cloud integration aside, PhotoScan skips fancy features
in favour of good quality. It can’t scan multiple photos or
export to PDF, like CamScanner does; instead, it captures
individual photos very clearly – even tiny, terrible-quality
passport-sized photos like the one in our Mini Workshop
on the right. Our efforts entailed taking screenshots at the
same time, so our hands were very shaky, but PhotoScan
still managed to focus and shoot. We got the best results
when not shooting too close.
It is tricky at first. PhotoScan reduces glare by passing
over the photo while shooting, and this requires that you
move your device to “join” four dots in a smooth, level
action, which is easier said than done. But it’s still less
hassle than fiddling with a flatbed scanner, and the results
are impressive, especially if you shoot in good natural light
and don’t rush – as we did.
To coincide with the launch of PhotoScan, Google has
updated Google Photos
with more advanced
editing tools and 12 new
filters that you can use
on your device or online.
It’s free for
Android, iOS
and online
(photos.

A computer version of the card
game Solitaire has been part
of Windows since 1990 – longer
than the Start button and taskbar.
It was developed by Wes Cherry,
who was at the time a Microsoft
intern, and built into Windows 3.0
“to soothe people intimidated by
the operating system,” apparently.
It’s still part of Windows, albeit in app form (bit.ly/
solitairewin413), and it’s finally made it onto Android and iOS, too.
The app offers five Solitaire games – Klondike, Spider, FreeCell,
TriPeaks and Pyramid – with Daily Challenges and Statistics to get
you hooked. Newcomers will welcome the optional pop-up tips and
the detailed ‘How to play’ section. All platforms support Xbox Live,
so you can compete with friends and family.
Some users have complained about ads, but that’s a small price
to pay for this welcome arrival. Expect to see it on small screens
in train carriages everywhere.

Fonty

It’s high time
someone
created a
serious app for
designing text
that isn’t
expensive or
iOS-only
(or both). Fonty
lets you create
your own lettering styles and customise
dozens of presets using typography
tools such as clipart, cutting/splicing
and calligraphy brushes. Be aware that
it’s much easier to operate on a tablet
screen than on a phone, unless you’re
using a stylus. Also, annoyingly, Fonty
insists that you enter licensing
information each time you
create or edit a font. You
can bypass this faff by
typing ‘me’ under Name,
then tapping the tick.
MUSIC
Remixlive

4.4

This app lets you create your own
dance music by tapping coloured pads
to ‘remix’ packs of samples, sounds and
effects, then twiddling virtual knobs to
adjust the mix and tempo. The music
styles are a bit limited unless you’re
into dubstep and house, but it’s a lot of
fun. You can save clips to your device
for free, but for unlimited export – and
to import music, vocals
and sounds for remixing
– you’ll need to make an
in-app purchase for the
ungroovy sum of £5.99.

It’s more than just a glorified video camera app – it uses
artificial intelligence to establish the direction, speed and
acceleration of every vehicle in view, then automatically
saves the data. It runs in the background so you
can use a navigation app at the same time, and
on certain phones it can simultaneously record
using the front camera, too. Nexar is still in beta

Henry Ford said you could have

It offers a superb degree of control
when composing your shot or
editing a photo from your device.
As well as adjusting light and
focus, you can try out presets and
colour filters before tapping to save. These filters don’t
colourise the photo but instead alter levels of
grey and contrast to achieve dramatic results
(it even made our old boots look exciting). The
app includes a feed of users’ photos, but there’s
no Instagram-style pressure to share your work.

and lets you search across both
live and on-demand programming.
If you have BBC iPlayer, All 4, iTV

And that’s not all – TV Planner
also lets you use your phone to
record programmes remotely
on your TalkTalk TV Plus box, so
they’re ready to watch as soon as
you get home. You can also set
reminders for TV shows and films.
Scanner Pro

If you’re looking for an Android app that
turns your phone into a pocket scanner, this
definitely isn’t the one. Not only does it cost
£5.49 – superior alternatives are available for
free – but it doesn’t
even work at a basic
level, because it
can’t turn scanned
documents into
editable text.
Instead, it simply
takes photos,
which you can do
just as well with
your camera, and
charges more
than a fiver to
do it. Useless.
Office Lens
bit.ly/lens413
(varies with device)
Microsoft’s Office Lens is the perfect
app for scanning documents, notes
and indeed anything that contains
a lot of text. On opening the app,
you can choose from four modes –
Document, Whiteboard, Photo and
‘Business card’ – to achieve the best
scan possible. Then simply point
your camera’s lens at the document
you want to capture and Office
Lens automatically outlines the
selection. Once you’ve taken the
picture, the app quickly processes it, correcting
wonky perspective and enhancing the colours
to make it look like a real scan. It rarely – if ever
– makes mistakes and backs up your scans to
OneDrive for safekeeping.

It’s been back and forth
through Parliament, but
now the controversial
Investigatory Powers
Act is law. David
Crookes explains what
it means for web users
Snooper’s Charter
becomes law
What is it?
The Snooper’s
Charter is a
new law that
allows a host
of government
bodies and law-
enforcement
agencies to
request access
to our online
data. It is
formally known
as the
Investigatory
Powers Act
2016 (bit.ly/
ipa413) and was passed in November
following a prolonged and highly
controversial parliamentary battle.
The Act represents the biggest change
to the UK’s surveillance powers in more
than 10 years.
What does the new law do?
Internet service providers and telephone
companies now have to keep a full record
of every site you visit and phone call you
make for a period of 12 months. They will
be forced to make this data available to
any authorised organisation that puts in
a request and will also be obliged to
decrypt the data if need be. On top of
that, the security services and police will
be able to hack phones and computers to
collect their own communications data.
Whose idea was this?
The law was first put forward in 2012
by Theresa May when she was Home
Secretary and has been seen through by
her successor, Amber Rudd. The claim is
that by replacing the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act, the law will
make us safer by allowing the authorities
to catch wrongdoers. In particular, Rudd
says GCHQ and law enforcers will be
better able to tackle the “new
opportunities” that the internet has
created for terrorists.
But who can access this data?
Aside from GCHQ, 47 other organisations
and departments can potentially access
your browsing records, including the
military, the taxman, the Gambling
Commission, the NHS and even the
Food Standards Agency (see the box
on the opposite page for the full list).
Opponents of the law have questioned
why many of the departments need
to see this data. The government has
promised to keep the list under review.
So basically anyone can access
my data?
No. Schedule 4 of the Act lists the
minimum office or rank of the people
authorised to make a request from each
department. Only higher or senior
officers in HMRC, for instance, or
someone on or above the level of
inspector or superintendent in the police,
will be able to request data. A warrant is
required if the security services wish to
bug computers and phones, though. This
will need to be authorised by ministers
and then go before the Investigatory
Powers Commissioner and a panel of
judges who have the power of veto.
Why do they want this
information?
According to the government, requests
for data can help locate a missing person.
Call records may establish a link between
suspect and victim, while online
information could be used to track
paedophiles and fraudsters. Other
examples given by proponents of the law
suggest digital records can support or
disprove alibis or be used to tie suspects
to crime scenes. Inevitably, supporters
say that if you’ve done nothing wrong
then you have nothing to fear, but there
are still many privacy concerns.

Discuss the Snooper’s Charter at forum.webuser.co.uk
Snooper’s Charter
It does sound scary. What can
be viewed?
Records kept by ISPs will detail the
websites and instant-messaging apps
you visit and use. Clearing the cache or
your browser
history won’t
make any
difference
because this
data is held
remotely.
However, the
logs won’t
reveal specific
pages – such as
an article about
terrorism or
a video featuring DIY disasters – only
that you visited BBC News and YouTube.
What do the critics say?
The privacy website Don’t Spy On Us
(www.dontspyonus.org.uk) points out
that ISPs and telephone companies will
be collecting our information regardless
of whether we are a criminal suspect or
not. It also says hacking undermines our
security. The Open Rights Group, Liberty
and Privacy International all say the law is
intrusive and oppose “mass surveillance”.
Big Brother Watch (www.bigbrotherwatch
.org.uk) points out that companies with
more than 10,000 users can be asked to
build “back doors” into their system, so
that data can be analysed.
Is it too late to stop the Act?
Not necessarily. An official petition
calling for the law to be repealed (bit.ly/
petition413) has been signed by close to
154,000 people at the time of going
to press, which means that Parliament
must consider debating it. In truth,
the likelihood of a repeal (given the Bill
went through on the third time of asking)
is very slim. In fact, the government has
responded by saying, “the Bill was
subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior
to and during its passage.” For them,
it’s done and dusted.
Were there any amendments to
the Bill, though?
Yes. Since we looked at the Snooper’s
Charter in Issue 385 (bit.ly/webuser385),
more than 1,700 amendments to the Bill
have been tabled and debated in
Parliament. The scope for equipment
interference was widened, for instance,
so that it wasn’t solely about preventing
and detecting serious crime but also any
cases where death or damage to health
was at stake. A serious crime was also
defined as one that carries a minimum
penalty of a six-month custodial sentence.
But what if the law is misused?
There is always a risk that the new
powers could be wrongly exploited but
the Act threatens “tough sanctions” for
those who do and it has made misuse a
criminal offence. Yet James Blessing, the
chairman of the Internet Service
Providers’ Association, told the BBC:
“It only takes one bad actor to go in
there and get the entire database.” He
worries “mistakes will happen”. There is
also concern about bulk hacking – where
large numbers of devices in a specified
location are targeted – which could result
in the harvesting of innocent people’s
data, such as NHS health records.
Can I get around all of this?
You can. If you sign up to a Virtual Private
Network (VPN), your ISP will only know
that you have visited a proxy server and
it won’t see any websites you open. Since
the law only obliges ISPs to hand over
data, anything you view from that point
is encrypted and hidden within the VPN.
NordVPN (nordvpn.com) says it has
already seen a significant rise in people
signing up. See our main cover feature on
page 38 for more about deleting your
personal info from the web.
So is all of this in place now?
The Act was given Royal Assent

Want to start afresh on the web in 2017?
Wayne Williams explains how to remove all
trace of your online activities so you can begin
the New Year with a completely clean slate
COVER

I
t’s the beginning of a new year,
which is traditionally a time when
we try to put the last year behind
us and start afresh with a healthier
and happier attitude. There’s not
much point in rebooting your life,
however, if remnants of your old one
are still strewn across the web – from
foolish Facebook posts and
incriminating Google searches to
records of embarrassing videos
you’ve watched on YouTube and
‘personal’ items you’ve purchased
from Amazon. In this feature, we
explain how to purge your accounts
and wipe your online footprint so
that you can start 2017 with a
completely clean slate.
Over the following six pages, we
explain how to remove your search
history from Google and prevent
your details from appearing in its
search results; how to erase traces
of your web activities; and how to
clean up your online profiles on
Facebook, Twitter and more.
We also show you how to back up
your Google and Facebook data
before you delete anything, just in
case you change your mind.

search. People with more unusual
names are much easier to find. If when
you Google yourself you see personal
information, such as your home address
or phone number, you can ask the
search giant to remove this from the
results. Google can’t remove the page
the information appears on from the
web (only the site administrator can do
that), but it can make it harder to find.
To request a removal, go to bit.ly/
ginfo413 and follow the instructions.
Remove content from Google
services
Google won’t remove just anything from
its services, but if you have legal
reasons for wanting content removed
from one of its sites, you can submit a
notice to Google at bit.ly/gcontent413.
This covers services including Search,
Google+, YouTube, Blogger, Images and
Google Drive/Docs, and complaints
such as copyright infringement,
defamation and – most pertinently
for this feature – privacy intrusion.
Annoyingly, if the content appears
on more than one service, you need to
go through the process multiple times.
Delete your Google or Gmail
account
This is very much a last resort, but if you
really want to wipe the slate clean for
2017, you could consider deleting your
Gmail or Google account and starting
again. Doing this will erase all your
emails, contacts, YouTube subscriptions
and synced Chrome data, as well as
your Android account and more, so you
must be 100% sure you want to do it.
Make sure you back up any important
data beforehand (see box on page 42).
You can delete just your Gmail account,
which will wipe all your messages and
stop you or anyone else using that
address in future, or – more drastically
REMOVE YOURSELF FROM GOOGLE
– your entire Google account.
To perform either action, head to the
Google Delete Services page (bit.ly/
gdel413) and make your choice. If you
only want to delete Gmail (or YouTube
or Google+) select ‘Delete products’.
You have the option to download
your data before going any further.
If you want to bid goodbye to Google
entirely, select ‘Delete Google Account
and data’ instead.
Remove yourself from YouTube
As we mention above, you can keep
your Google and Gmail accounts but
delete your YouTube account, which
wipes any videos you’ve uploaded.
If you don’t want to go that far, you can
just delete certain videos by opening
the video manager (www.youtube.com/
my_videos), clicking the down button
next to a clip and selecting Remove.
Alternatively, you can hide videos so
that no-one else can see them.
Popular or interesting videos are
sometimes cloned – that is, uploaded
by other users. If someone is sharing
your work without permission, you can
submit a copyright takedown notice to
YouTube (bit.ly/ytcopyright413). If you
want to be removed from someone
else’s video, the best option is to ask the
person who uploaded it if they would
mind taking it down. If they refuse, you
can lodge a privacy complaint with
YouTube at bit.ly/ytpriv413.
Clear your Google search history
It’s no secret that Google stores every
search you make – whether it’s through
the search engine itself or YouTube,
Maps, Google Play and so on – and uses
the data to build a profile of your
interests and target you with adverts.
The frightening part is just how much
data the company has on you, and how
many searches you perform every day
without ever really thinking about it.
To see exactly what Google knows
about you, and to delete these records
so you can start 2017 without the
baggage of past searches, go to
myactivity.google.com and sign into
your Google account. Here, you’ll see
all your Google searches sorted by date
and organised by service, such as
YouTube. You can click the three vertical
dots next to any entry and select Delete
to remove it. If you want to erase more

Delete your Yahoo Mail account
Yahoo recently admitted that hackers
had breached its security in 2014,
stealing millions of account details.
Then it was revealed that the company
had been scanning users’ emails for the
NSA and the FBI. If these incidents have
prompted you to give up on Yahoo, you
can delete your account. Follow the
instructions at bit.ly/ybackup413 to save
your email, contacts and calendar data,
then go to the Delete User page (bit.ly/
ydel413). Log in with your details and
follow the instructions. If you change
your mind, you have 90 days to recover
your account before it’s gone for good.
Unlike Google, Yahoo occasionally
makes deleted email addresses available
to new users, which means that in the
future a stranger might receive emails
meant for you. Sadly, the only way to
ensure this doesn’t happen is to keep
your Yahoo account active.
Delete your Microsoft account
You need a Microsoft account to get
the most out of Windows 10, but you
can log in with a local account if you
wish, and this option may be preferable
if you don’t plan to use OneDrive or
install apps from the Windows Store
(you can now download free apps
without an account). There’s also the
matter of Microsoft collecting your data
to build a profile of you.
If you want to delete a Microsoft
account completely and you’re using
Windows 10, you first need to remove
it from your PC.
You can’t delete
an account while
you’re signed
into it, so go to
Settings, Accounts
and click ‘Sign in
with a local
account instead’.
Enter your account
password and
follow the steps.
Once you’ve
signed into a local account, go to
Settings, Accounts. Select Your Info and
you can delete the account from there.
The next step is to delete it from
Microsoft’s servers. Make sure you’ve
backed up anything you need that’s
linked to that account, and go to bit.ly/
msdel413. Enter your password and
verify your identity with a code. Follow
the advice on screen before you close
your account, and click the Next button
to begin the termination process.
Delete your eBay account
An eBay account is useful if you ever
find you need to buy or sell something
through the online marketplace. If you
no longer use the website, however,
or you simply want to erase all traces
of your past transactions, you can close
your account by signing in and going to
My eBay, Summary. Click the Account
tab and then click ‘Close my account’,
which appears on the right-hand side.
Be warned that you won’t be able to
create a new account using the same
ID or email address.

Remove yourself from 192.com
The online directory 192.com stores all
sorts of information about you,
including your full name and that of
your spouse, your home address, the
names of your neighbours, how long
you’ve lived at your current address,
your approximate age and more. It
pulls this data from public databases
such as the electoral roll. Some
information can be accessed for free
on the site, but for a more detailed
profile, searchers need to buy credits.
To have your information
removed from the site, you need
to fill in a Record Removal Form
(bit.ly/192form413) (PDF file) and
send it back to the company by
email, post or fax. Removals take
anything from seven to 21 days.
Unsubscribe from mailing lists
Most of us receive at least some
regular marketing emails or
newsletters from companies we’ve
either signed up to or bought
something from. Instead of simply
ignoring or deleting these when they
arrive, why not take a moment to
unsubscribe instead? Gmail is great
for this. Open one of the emails, and
you should see an Unsubscribe link
next to the sender’s email address at
the top. Click this to unsubscribe. If
you can’t see this option, check the
end of the message to see if there’s an
unsubscribe link there instead.
Remove your details from
Whois
If you own a website, or you’ve ever
registered a domain for one, your
personal details, such as your name,
home address, email address and
phone number, will be available on the
Whois database (such as www.whois
.net) for anyone to look up. To stop
this happening, domain-registration
services such as 123 Reg offer Domain
Privacy for around £5 a year (bit.ly/
dompriv413). When someone queries
a protected domain, all they’ll see are
the generic privacy service registrant
details. You can add this protection to
a new domain or one you’ve
previously registered through 123
Reg. Other domain-registering sites
offer similar protection.

Remove several accounts at once
using Deseat.me
When you sign up for new web services,
you’re often given the option to log in
using your Google account credentials.
This saves you having to enter your
personal details and come up with a
new password, and because it’s Google,
you can be relatively confident that it’s
safe. However, there’s a good chance
you’ve forgotten about some of the
sites you’ve logged into, which means
your online footprint is larger than you
realise. Deseat.me (www.deseat.me) is a
new service that lets you see any sites
you’ve logged into using your Google
credentials and add them to a delete
queue for removal. See our Mini
Workshop on the opposite page to find
out how to use it.
Find out how to close different
accounts
The procedure for closing an online
account isn’t always easy or obvious.
Some websites make it straightforward
– just click a link to begin the process –
while others go out of their way to stop
you leaving. JustDeleteMe (justdelete
.me) is a handy directory of links to help
you close your accounts, and covers
services such as Adobe, Amazon,
Dropbox, Gmail, Kickstarter, Instagram,
Feedly, and StumbleUpon. Entries are
colour-coded to indicate how easy (or
otherwise) it is to close an account with
that service. Green is simple, amber is
medium, red is difficult and black is
impossible. Install JustDeleteMe’s
Chrome add-on (bit.ly/jdm413) and
when you visit a site for which you have
an unwanted account, click the dot that
appears and the extension will take you
to the relevant page.
AccountKiller (www.accountkiller
.com) is similar, and sorts its list of
sites by category – including popular,
blacklist (sites you can’t remove yourself
from) and whitelist (sites you can
OPT OUT OF DATABASES
remove yourself from). Adding
the SiteCheck bookmarklet gives
you an easy way to find out
whether a site will allow you
to remove your account easily
before you sign up to it. You can
use this bookmarklet on mobile
devices, too, including iPhone
and iPad.
Stop people getting your personal
details through your website

As the old saying goes, “act in haste,
repent at leisure”. In other words,
make sure you back up your data
before you delete an account in case
you change your mind. To do this for
Google’s services, use the company’s
Takeout page (bit.ly/takeout413).
Choose which services you want to
include, or select everything. Then
click Next and choose an archive
format to save the data in (ZIP is the
default). You can receive your backup
as a download from a link sent by
email, or save it to Drive, Dropbox
or OneDrive. Although you can
browse the data, you can’t simply
import it into a new account –
Takeout is an export-only service.
BACK UP DATA BEFORE YOU DELETE
If you’re only backing up a Gmail
account, try using a free tool such as
MailStore Home 10 (www.mailstore
.com) instead. To copy messages
from an old Gmail account to a new
one, try CloudGopher (bit.ly/
cgopher413). It costs $24.99
(£20) – or $14.99 (£12) if you
publicise it on Facebook.
Backing up your Facebook data is
just as easy. Go to Settings and,
under General Account Settings,
you’ll see a link to download a copy
of your data. Click this, then click
Start My Archive and enter your
password. Your backup will include
posts, photos and videos you’ve
shared, as well as messages, chats and
your profile. You can’t pick what to
back up – it’s all or nothing.
Make sure only your friends can see your old Facebook posts
Delete your Facebook account to reclaim your life in 2017
42 30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017
CLEAN UP YOUR PUBLIC PROFILES
stop using the social network – either
forever or just to take a breather – but
you don’t think you can do it by
willpower alone, deactivating your
account might be the answer.
To do this, open Settings from the
menu and select Security. At the bottom
of the page you’ll see the option to
Deactivate Your Account. Select this,
then click (or tap, if you’re using the
Facebook app) Deactivate Your
Account and give Facebook a reason for
your decision. Enter your password and
select Deactivate Now. If you change
your mind later, you can reactivate your
account by logging back in.
If you decide that you never
want to use Facebook again, you
can delete your account completely.
To do this, go to bit.ly/fbdel413 and
click the blue Delete My Account
button. Bear in mind that this is
permanent – once you’ve deleted
your account, it’s gone for good,
so don’t select this option just
because you’re in a bad mood!
Similarly, you can mass-delete tweets
from Twitter using TweetEraser (www
.tweeteraser.com), either within a
specific range of dates or from the
moment you joined the social network.
If you want to wipe all your tweets and
start again without affecting all the
people you follow and who follow you,
try TwitWipe (twitwipe.com). Deleting
all your tweets can take a very long
time, so be patient.
The best idea is to
leave the process
running overnight.
Say goodbye to
Facebook
Facebook makes
it easy to keep in
touch with friends,
family and even
casual acquaintances,
but if you’re not
careful it can take
over your whole
life. If you want to
Bulk-remove social-media posts
If you’re applying for a new job or
starting a new relationship and are
worried that messages and photos
you’ve shared on Facebook and Twitter
might count against you, consider
cleaning up your social-media accounts.
To hide old public posts on Facebook,
click the padlock in the top-right corner
and select See More Settings. Click
Limit Past Posts, then click the Limit Old
Posts button. This changes the settings
for content shared on your profile so
that only your friends can see it. You
can also review any posts and photos
you’re tagged in by clicking Use Activity
Log in the top-right corner. Options
include making public content private,
hiding specific posts and ‘unliking’
things you’ve liked in the past. To make
the process easier, you can use the
Facebook Post Manager extension for
Chrome (bit.ly/fbpost413) to batch-
delete content from the site and start
2017 with a clean Facebook slate.

What we liked:
AllDup is the perfect tool
to help you find duplicate
images, documents
and music files that
accumulate on your hard
drive over time.
When launched, it lets you
choose which drives (including external
drives) and folders you want to scan,
and you can opt to compare files
between all folders or only within
individual directories. Next, you can
click the Search Method tab to choose
the criteria on which your search is
based from a list that includes name,
size, file extension, content and
modified date. You can tick any number
of these boxes, or there’s a handy
Similar Pictures tool that lets you search
for images that look the same.
Once you’re happy with these
settings, you can fine-tune your search
using the file and folder filters, which let
you exclude (or include) specific folders
and formats. Finally, click Start Search
and the program quickly displays
duplicate files, conveniently sorted into
groups. Expanding a group lets you see
the files it contains and view important
information about each one, including
name, location and size.
One thing we particularly like about
AllDup is that it lets you preview
duplicates without opening any other
software, so it’s easy to quickly identify
genuine duplicates and choose an
appropriate action, such as permanently
deleting the copies, moving them to the
Recycle Bin, or opening AllDup’s File
Manager to copy, rename or move them.
AllDup’s standout feature is that it
includes a Windows right-click menu
option that lets you quickly scan folders
for duplicates. The software is totally
free, optimised for Windows 10 and
available as a portable app.
How it can be improved:
AllDup’s interface isn’t as simple or as
intuitive as DupeGuru. In particular, it
took us a while to work out how to close
the results page and start a new search.
OUR VERDICT
If you want to free up space on your
PC by deleting duplicate files,
there’s no better program than
AllDup. It offers powerful search
tools and displays your results in
a simple, clear manner, so you can
quickly and easily take the
appropriate action.

Duplicate scanners
30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017 45
Discuss duplicate scanners at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
Despite no longer being
supported by its
developer (the last
Windows version was
released in 2014),
DupeGuru remains one of
our favourite duplicate finders
because it’s simple and works very well,
even in Windows 10. The tool has the
simplest interface of any duplicate
finder we tested: click the + button to
choose the folders you want to scan,
select Scan, and it quickly displays any
duplicate files in a simple, clear list.
From this results screen, you can
double-click files to view them and
there are handy tickboxes to let you
move or delete duplicates in bulk.
By default, DupeGuru compares files’
contents, which is very effective, but
you can also scan files by filename if
you open the Preferences menu. When
you choose this option, there’s a Filter
Hardness slider that lets you choose
how closely the names must match.
Picture and Music editions of DupeGuru
are also available although, sadly, these
are even more out of date.
What we liked:
CloneSpy is a
sophisticated duplicate
scanner that finds files
with similar names, and
files with the same content
but different names. Like
AllDup, it gives you total control
over how you compare files, letting you
search for duplicates across multiple
folders or drives, and compare a distinct
group of directories (known as a ‘pool’)
to another. The program’s default
search simply looks for duplicate
content, but you can narrow your
results further by specifying, for
example, ‘duplicates having the same
file name’ or ‘files having the same
name and similar size’.
Unlike some of its rivals, CloneSpy
can be set to automatically delete all
duplicates, but we recommend using
the ‘Ask user’ option unless you know
exactly what you’re doing. This makes
CloneSpy display a pop-up for each
match to quickly take appropriate
action, whether that’s opening a file’s
location in Windows Explorer, deleting
it or continuing with your search.
How it can be improved:
CloneSpy is trickier to grasp than either
of our other award winners and its
Options menu, in particular, takes time
to master. We’re not keen that it
displays duplicates one by one, though
this can be changed.
How it can be improved:
Our main criticism is that DupeGuru is
no longer supported (unless you’re
using Linux or macOS), so you may find
bugs when using it in Windows 10. It
also automatically determines which of
your files is the original, which is
irritating when it gets it wrong.
OUR VERDICT
DupeGuru’s fast, powerful scanning
and simple interface make it the
ideal tool for quick tidy-ups.
OUR VERDICT
CloneSpy is one of the most
powerful free scanners we tested,
but many of its features and
settings are too complex for the
average user.
CCleaner
www.piriform.com/ccleaner
If you already have CCleaner, you
can use its duplicate-finding tool
simply by opening its Tools menu.
Although it lacks the features of our
award winners, it’s perfect for
quick, one-off searches, especially if
you don’t want to install additional
software. You
can search for
files with
duplicate
content, name,
size and
modified date
(or any
combination of the above), and
results are presented in a clear,
simple manner.
Duplicate Cleaner Free
bit.ly/duplicatecleaner413
As its name suggests, Duplicate
Cleaner Free is the free version of a
paid-for tool, but that doesn’t stop
it from offering an impressive set of
features. Indeed, you can search for
files with duplicate content or
similar names
(as well as
specifying a
range of other
criteria), and
there’s even
a handy Audio
Mode for
finding tracks with the same artists
and titles. Unfortunately, to take
advantage of the program’s Image
Mode, you’ll need to upgrade at the
cost of £19.95.
SearchMyFiles
bit.ly/search413
SearchMyFiles is a powerful search
tool from Nirsoft that lets you find
duplicate files based on content
or name. It
offers a range
of options to
help you
narrow your
search, and
it’s portable,
so you can
run it from
a USB stick
without leaving traces in the
Registry. Unfortunately, we found
SearchMyFiles more fiddly to use
than other tools that offer the
same features.

Shrink JPEGs and PNGs
Most image-editing software
lets you reduce the size of
pictures saved in JPEG or PNG
format, but if you’re not careful, that can
have an impact on their quality. There
are several online tools that can shrink
your photos without introducing any
noticeable flaws, including the excellent
TinyJPG (tinyjpg.com) which, despite its
name, can handle both JPEGs and PNGs.
Drop up to 20 images (with a
maximum size of 5MB each) on to
the site, and TinyJPG will intelligently
decrease the file size and show you how
much space you’ve saved. Alternatively,
try Optimizilla (optimizilla.com) which
is similar and can also handle up to
20 files in the two formats.
If you prefer to use a Desktop
program, try RIOT (bit.ly/riot411), which
is specifically designed to shrink images
for sharing on the web. The Radical
Image Optimization Tool – to give it
its full name – delivers high compression
rates without compromising image
quality. Its full auto mode chooses the
best options for you, and the side-by-
side view lets you compare the
optimised version of the image with
the original. RIOT works with JPEG,
PNG and GIF files.
Shrink animated GIFs
Animated GIFS can be a lot
of fun, and plenty of websites
– including Facebook – now
support them. Unfortunately, the GIFs
you download from the web can
sometimes be too large to use on other
sites, and your standard image editor
may not be able to shrink them without
stripping out the animation. The
GIFGIFS Online GIF Optimizer (gifgifs
.com/optimizer) solves this problem
by reducing the number of colours in
GIFs and removing non-essential frames.
It diminishes the quality a little, but
you can choose what to change and
remove from your GIFs so the impact
should be minimal.
If you need to alter the physical
dimensions of the GIF – rather than its
file size – you can use GIFGIFs’ resizer
instead (gifgifs.com/resizer). Simply
Files are sometimes too large to store or share easily. Wayne Williams
reveals the best ways to shrink images, videos and other files without
affecting their quality
upload the image and use the slider
to adjust the dimensions.
Alternatively, you can download GIF
Optimizer Free (bit.ly/gifopt411) to
change the size of your animated GIFs.
Just open the file you want to compress
and click Optimise to shrink it.
Shrink large videos
Video files are often huge, and
can take ages to upload or
download. The best solution is
to convert the existing video format to
MP4, if it isn’t already, using a tool such
as Handbrake (www.handbrake.fr). This
free program can convert most video
formats, and is very easy to use. Import
Resize any file
without losing quality
TinyJPG can shrink the size of your photos
without diminishing the image quality
RIOT reduces the size of your images so
you can share them online
Make animated GIFs less unwieldy without
making them less fun!
Handbrake looks complicated but it makes
shrinking your videos easy

30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017 47
Resize any file
a file to convert, make sure the output
container is set to MP4 and tick the
‘Web Optimized’ box. Select the Video
tab and make sure H.264 (X264) is
selected. You can tweak the settings
if you wish (slower speeds are better),
but the defaults should be fine. Choose
a destination, then click the Start button
to scale down the video without
distorting the picture.
Shrink MP3 files
As with JPEG, MP3 is a ‘lossy’
file format, which means it strips
and discards certain details from
the original audio. However, because
MP3 removes sounds that aren’t
generally perceptible to the human ear,
you probably won’t notice the difference
on a reasonably good-quality track.
MP3Smaller (www.mp3smaller.com)
is an online service that reduces the file
size of MP3s by adjusting their bitrate.
Upload your file (up to a maximum of
150MB), then pick the bitrate you want
from the drop-down menu – the lower
the bitrate, the smaller the size. Bear in
mind that lowering the bitrate will also
reduce the audio quality, so you should
experiment to find a balance that works
for you. 128Kbps is a decent minimum to
aim for, or you can choose 128-256Kbps
VBR (variable bitrate). This will attempt
to maintain the quality while removing
inessential data. The size will be larger
than a 128Kbps-encoded file, but should
be smaller than a track encoded in
256Kbps CBR (constant bitrate).
Shrink Word documents
Images embedded in Word
documents can significantly
inflate the overall file size. As
with PDFs, you can compress pictures to
shrink the Office file without (hopefully)
losing too much quality. In Word 2013 or
newer, click an image, and select
Compress Pictures in the menu. You can
choose whether to apply your changes
to just the one image, and optionally
delete cropped areas of pictures.
You can also adjust the default
resolution – the lower the quality of
the images, the smaller the size of your
documents. 220ppi is a good quality
for printing, while 150ppi is usually fine
for viewing on screen. For emails, you
might be able to get away with 96ppi.
Some images – such as graphs – can
be reduced even further without their
quality being affected.
Go to File and, under Properties,
you should see the current size of your
document. From that menu, open
Options, and click Advanced. You can
discard editing data, which is used to
restore edited images to their original
state, and choose whether or not Word
should compress images in the file
automatically. You can adjust the default
resolution to lower the quality of the
images here, too.
Shrink PDF files
PDFs contain all the data
needed to display a file properly,
but some media formats – such
as images – inflate the overall file size.
PDF Reducer Free (bit.ly/pdfreduce411)
can slim down PDFs by resampling any
photos and graphics and removing
unused objects. The publisher claims
it can reduce the size of PDFs by
up to 80%.
There are no major limitations in
the free version, but it does nag you
to upgrade every five files.
Compress files by 70%
When you’re compressing files,
it’s obviously important to save
as much space as you can.
7-Zip (www.7-zip.org) generally has the
highest compression ratio of other
similar programs. To make the most of it,
you’ll need to use the software’s own
proprietary 7z format, which promises
a 30-70% size reduction over files
compressed using the ZIP format in
other programs.
If you have a small image file, making
it bigger will introduce all sorts of
problems, such as blurring, general
loss of sharpness and jagged edges.
There are several free programs that
you can use to intelligently increase
the size of your photos without
causing problems. Two of the best are
Reshade Image Enlarger (reshade
.com), which we wrote about in Issue
407, and A Sharper Scaling
(a-sharper-scaling.com). They both
use photo-enlargement algorithms
to produce crisper resizes. Reshade
Image Enlarger was originally a paid
program, but is now entirely free.
It claims to be able to zoom an image
by up to 2,000%, but you need a fairly
decent image to begin with if you’re
going to really super-size it.
If you have a logo you want to
resize, it’s worth turning it into a
scalable vector using the online tools
Autotracer (www.autotracer.org)
or VectorMagic (vectormagic.com).

Use Windows Task Scheduler to automate
tedious system cleanups
You can automatically delete old files
from your Downloads folder
Run daily, weekly or monthly malware
scans in Avast Free Antivirus
48 30 Dec 2016 - 10 Jan 2017
chedule system cleanups
during downtime
In the past, removing junk from your PC
could take hours, during which time you
couldn’t use your PC for anything else.
Scans are faster and smarter these days,
but they can still slow down your system
so it’s worth scheduling them for quiet
times. The easiest way to do this is to
use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler
to automatically run a cleanup tool such
as CCleaner or Disk Cleanup.
To launch Task Scheduler, either
search for schedule and choose Task
Scheduler or click ‘Schedule tasks’ in
the ‘System and Security’ section of the
Control Panel, then click Create Basic
Task. Enter a name for the task, such as
‘CCleaner weekly scan’, specify how
frequently you want to perform it, then
choose a start date and time. Select
‘Start a program’ and browse to the
EXE file for the cleanup tool you want
to use – this is usually
C:\Program Files\CCleaner
for CCleaner, or
C:\Windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe
for Disk Cleanup
In the ‘Add arguments (optional)’
field, type /auto to perform an
automated CCleaner cleanup or
sagrun:1 for Disk Cleanup. Tick the
box ‘Open the Properties dialog for this
task when I click Finish’, click Finish and
select the option ‘Run with highest
privileges’ to allow the task to be run as
an administrator.
Remember that your automated
cleanups will run with your most recent
settings for that program, so make sure
they don’t delete too much – or too little!
elete old downloads
automatically
Your Downloads folder is probably
crammed with programs, PDFs, ZIP files
and other items that you opened once
and then forgot about. Although it’s
easy to delete them all – Ctrl+A, then
bosh! – remembering to do so is another
matter, so for privacy and space reasons
it’s worth scheduling regular, automatic
clearouts. One option is to use a tool
such as CCleaner, as described in the
previous step, but a speedier solution is
to create a task that specifically targets
the Downloads folder to remove files
you downloaded more than a week ago.
Open Notepad and type the following
(or copy it from our page-by-page links
page at bit.ly/links413):
REM Remove files older than 7
days
forfiles /p “C:\[your name]\
Downloads” /s /m *.* /c “cmd
/c Del @path” /d -7
You can change the number of days
from ‘7’ to a longer period, and should
Our New Year’s resolution is to do less over the next 12 months. Robert
Irvine explains how to schedule PC and web tasks to run automatically
set the path to that of your Downloads
folder. Save the file under the name
‘Clearup.bat’ or similar (the ‘.bat’ is the
important part), then double-click and
your Downloads folder will be emptied.
Now you know that the task works,
you can use it to perform regular
clearouts. Open the Windows Task
Scheduler, create a basic task as in the
previous tip and select the ‘Clearup.bat’
file at the ‘Start a program’ stage. Finish
the task and your Downloads folder will
now be self-maintaining.
utomate your regular
antivirus scans
The paid-for versions of security
programs often have built-in schedulers
that save you from having to perform
scans manually and wait around for
them to finish. With free editions, you’re
usually limited to triggering a ‘boot-time’
scan that runs when you next start your
PC, but there are notable exceptions.
For example, Avast Free Antivirus
(www.avast.com) has an option to
schedule daily, weekly or monthly scans,
although it’s not easy to find. To access
it, click the Scan button on the Avast
home screen, choose ‘Scan for viruses’
and select ‘Quick scan’ or ‘Full system
scan’ from the drop-down menu. Click
the Scan Settings link at the bottom of

the screen, choose Scheduling on the
left and tick the box ‘Schedule this scan’.
You can now decide the frequency of
the scan, what time and day you want
it to start, and whether to shut down
your PC when the scan is complete and
any malware has been removed.
In Windows 10, you can schedule
a malware scan using the built-in
Windows Defender tool. Go to Task
Scheduler, Task Scheduler Library,
Microsoft, Windows, then scroll down
and double-click the Windows Defender
folder. Double-click the Windows
Defender Scheduled Scan option and
choose a time and frequency for
the scan.
Remember to keep your virus
databases up to date, so that scheduled
scans detect the latest threats.
et Ellp to help with
everyday tasks
There are lots of dull but necessary
tasks you probably perform on your
PC every day, from switching it off at
night to launching your browser to visit
websites. Happily, you can now get help
with at least a few of these chores from
a new program called Ellp (www.ellp
.com). Simply choose an action – for
example, ‘When my hard disk is getting
full, free up space’ or ‘When it’s time
for bed, mute the sound on my PC’ –
and specify parameters for the ‘rule’,
such as the times it should be applied
or the threshold at which it kicks in.
Click Activate to confirm.
There are only eight tasks in the
current free beta version. These span
categories including Schedule, Internet
and Device, but more are coming soon
and you can tell Ellp your email address
to add new options as soon as they
become available. We love the
program’s simple, attractive interface
and that tasks can be easily toggled
on and off.
utomate everything you
do online
The popular task-automation service
IFTTT (ifttt.com) has made web users’
lives easier since 2011, and was recently
revamped with some welcome new
features for combining online services.
Previously, IFTTT (which stands for
‘if this, then that’) used a system called
‘recipes’, which combined a trigger –
such as ‘If someone tags me in a
Facebook photo’ – with an action – such
as ‘back up the photo to my Google
Drive’. These recipes have now been
replaced by ‘applets’, which allow
multiple actions to be assigned to
a single trigger. This means you can,
for example, create a ‘morning routine’
that performs a series of actions –
opening your Google Calendar, playing
a Spotify song, updating your Facebook
status – at a specific time every day.
You can either create your own
applets from scratch by choosing
a service, creating a trigger and
selecting the desired action; or use one
of the thousands of applets that users
have shared on the IFTTT website
(ifttt.com/discover). Sensibly, IFTTT has
also merged its IF and DO mobile apps
into one, so creating applets on your
Android or iOS device is now very
straightforward.
Microsoft often draws inspiration from
other companies’ ideas (or just copies them),
and it recently launched its own IFTTT rival
called Flow (flow.microsoft.com). While this
is geared toward ‘business processes’ and
Microsoft’s own tools, it’s certainly worth
considering as a more focused alternative
to IFTTT’s limitless sea of automation
possibilities. Flow currently covers 72
services including Facebook, WordPress ,
YouTube and several other Google tools
(although not Gmail) and works in much the
same way as IFTTT. Choose a service, then a
template (Flow’s equivalent to applets) such
as ‘back up OneDrive files to Google Drive’
or ‘Get a text when you receive an email
from your manager’, then sign into the
relevant accounts and set your conditions.
Unlike IFTTT, the free version of Flow can
only be run 750 times per month, and at 15-minute intervals; if you need more,
you can pay $5 (about £4) per month. On the plus side, it offers free apps for
iOS and Android, and is adding new services and templates all the time.

f you’re worried about websites
tracking your online activity,
particularly across accounts and
devices, then Mozilla’s Firefox Focus is
for you. It lets you browse the internet
in private, blocking the trackers that
follow you around the web and killing
any ads you encounter. It’s very easy
to use, super-fast, and there are no
tabs, menus or pop-ups to bother you.
It works with Apple’s default Safari
browser, too (but, due to Apple’s
restrictions, not Firefox for iOS), so
if you encounter a site that doesn’t
display properly in Focus, you can switch
browsers, and it will continue to block
adverts and tracking in the background.
Firefox Focus is only available for iOS
for now but may be introduced for
Android in the future.
Browse privately on iOS with
Firefox Focus | bit.ly/fff413

This screen lets you choose which
tools are enabled. Safari integration is
off by default. Tap the switch 1 to turn it
on and use Firefox Focus as a content
blocker in Apple’s web browser.
Instructions appear that explain what you
need to do, or you can follow the
instructions in Step 6.
1
Getting started with the new browser
couldn’t be easier. Just launch Firefox
Focus and you’re greeted with this rather
sparse purple screen. The slogan
‘Browse. Erase. Repeat’ 1 perfectly sums
up how the app works. Tap the ‘Search or
enter address’ box that appears in the
centre of the screen. 2
2
On the next screen, you can enter
some search terms or a website
address. 1 Tap Go 2 to action your
request. The browser will use your default
search engine for queries, which is likely
to be Google. You can’t change your
search preference directly in Focus.
3
Browse the web exactly as you would
normally but bear in mind that
Firefox Focus doesn’t offer tabs, so you
can only have one page open at a time.
You can navigate backwards and
forwards in pages 1 and reload the
current one. 2 To start afresh, tap on the
Erase button. 3
Firefox Focus is a fast, private browser and
ad blocker for iPhone and iPad. Here’s how
to make the most of its features
4
You’ll be taken back to the front
purple screen. The web-page details,
cookies, and any searches you’ve
performed will be wiped. 1 You can run a
fresh search or go to a new website.
You’ll soon get into the habit of browsing
in this way. Tap on the cog in the
top-right corner. 2

Stop programs leaving
junk in your Registry
2
Choose the HTML option. 1 The text version is quicker
to load but the HTML version doesn’t take much longer
and it looks nicer, too. Click the ‘1st shot’ button and
choose ‘Shot and Save’. 2 After a couple of minutes, a Save As
box opens so you can choose where to save it.
1
The software is portable so you don’t need to install it, just
unpack the files. There are four executable files. If you’re
using a 64-bit version of Windows, double-click Regshot-
x64-ANSI. 1 32-bit users should use Regshot-x86-ANSI. 2 The
Unicode versions are for PCs using international characters.
3
It’s worth thinking about how you save your snapshots
so it’s easy to find and identify them later. Create a folder
specifically for this kind of file somewhere sensible, such
as in your Documents folder. 1 Also, name the files
descriptively, so you can see what they are at a glance. 2
4
Having taken your first snapshot, you can now install the
program you want to monitor. 1 Try to do this as soon as
possible after the first snapshot, to minimise the amount
of interference from anything else that’s going on in the
background on your computer.
W
hen you install a program on your PC, it makes
changes to the Windows Registry. These changes
should all be reversed when you uninstall the
software, but that’s not always the case. You can correct this
yourself by using the Registry Editor (or a number of even
better tools, such as those we reviewed in Issue 385, bit.ly/
webuser385), but it’s tricky work and you need to know what
you’re doing. We recommend that you always create a
restore point and back up your Registry (see Step 9) before
you start tinkering with its settings.
Regshot lets you take a snapshot of your Registry before
and after you install software, so you can spot any changes.
You can then take more snapshots when uninstalling the
software, and check that those changes have been rectified.
Regshot’s files are in the compressed 7Z format. If you don’t
already have a tool that will open them, download and use
7-Zip (www.7-zip.org).

When the software has finished installing, click ‘2nd shot’.
From the options, choose ‘Shot and Save’. 1 If you closed
Regshot between snapshots, you may need to reload the
first snapshot before comparing them. Click the appropriate
snapshot button, choose Load 2 and select the file to restore it. 6
Click the Compare button. 1 If you selected the HTML
option, your browser will now open displaying the results.
2 There will be a lot of Registry changes listed, many of
which specifically mention the software you’ve installed. 3
7
The log files will be saved to the folder specified under
‘Output path’ and automatically named. To better organise
them, right-click a blank area of the page, select ‘Save as’
1 and save the file to the folder where you’re keeping your
other Regshot files. Give them a name that makes sense to you. 8
Go through the process again when you uninstall the
software, taking one snapshot before you start and
another when it’s finished. Compare the two files and
create an HTML document. Hopefully it will list many of the
changes that also appeared in your first HTML document. 1
10
Use the folder tree in the left-hand panel 1 to
navigate your way to any leftover Registry entries.
Right-click the item and choose Delete. 2 If the
changes you make cause problems on your PC, you can restore
your Registry backup using Import from the File menu. 3
9
If you find references to the program you installed in the
first HTML document that aren’t in the second, press
Windows+R, type regedit and press Enter. Back up the
Registry by opening the File menu 1 and choosing Export. 2
Under ‘Export range’, ensure that the All option 3 is selected.
Andy Shaw says
You can also compare individual folders (rather than the Registry, which is more like a database)
to see any changes that may have been made before and after installing software. Tick the box
next to ‘Scan dir1’. It’s set to the C:\Windows folder by default but you can change it by typing in
a different one. To add more than one folder, separate the entries with semicolons.

Download ClipLogger, extract its contents and run the
application. An empty window appears. Click Hide 1 to
minimise the tool. Copy multiple, separate passages, then
open ClipLogger from the notification area and you’ll see each
item listed separately, marked with a timestamp. 2
2
From here, you can select and copy some or all of the
text using Ctrl+C and paste it to another program. Once
you’re finished with the clipboard text, click Clear 1 or
press Ctrl+D to delete it from ClipLogger, or highlight and
delete individual sections.
3
As well as copying passages of text, ClipLogger lets you
copy file locations from Windows Explorer by right-
clicking the file or files in question and selecting Copy. 1
If you’d prefer for this information not be copied to ClipLogger,
untick the Filenames box.
4
For more options, click the ‘Settings/About...’ button.
This menu lets you set ClipLogger to launch on startup 1
and add a shortcut to the Start menu. 2 You can also
tick the option to ‘Close to Tray’ 3 to avoid accidentally closing
the software.
5
By default, ClipLogger spaces out your entries and adds
time stamps, but you can untick the boxes to disable
these respective settings. 1 Ticking the box to ‘Backup
Contents to file’ 2 saves your clipboard entries to a TXT file
saved in the ClipLogger folder.
6
To change the style of text you’ve copied to ClipLogger,
click the three-dot button and choose a font, 1 font style
2 and size 3 from the dialogue box that appears. Click
OK, then OK again to save your new settings.
Save unlimited clipboard items
C
opying and pasting in Windows is a straightforward
process, but sometimes you might want to copy more
than one item, without it overwriting what’s already there.
ClipLogger is a lightweight tool that lets you copy unlimited
items to the clipboard, without
having to switch to another
program to paste your saved
items every time.

Block noisy ads and unwanted browser sounds
I
t can be both annoying and embarrassing when a website
suddenly bursts into noise, whether from an obtrusive
advert or a background video you can’t even see. Silent
Site Sound Blocker (SSSB) is a new Chrome add-on that can
fix this problem for good, giving you
complete control over which sites you
want to be able to hear – such as YouTube
– and which ones you don’t.
Silent Site Sound Blocker: bit.ly/sssb413 |
10 mins |
1
Install the SSSB add-on from the Chrome Store. By
default, the app runs in Whitelist mode, so any sites not
added to the whitelist are silenced and display the Mute
icon. 1 Here, SSSB’s button is yellow 2 because the site in
our screengrab is neither whitelisted nor blacklisted.
2
If you open a site that plays audio, a pop-up lets you add
the site to your whitelist 1 (always let sound through);
add it to the blacklist 2 (always block sound); or
choose to block 3 or allow 4 sound on just this occasion (so
you’ll see this box again the next time you launch the page).
3
If you use the box to add a site to your whitelist, the
SSSB icon turns white. 1 It changes to black if you
blacklist the site instead. If you change your mind about
what you want to do with a site, right-click the button and
choose ‘Blacklist site’ 2 or ‘Whitelist site’ as appropriate. 4
You can also change the add-on’s behaviour by
right-clicking the icon. Hover over Mode 1 to open the
submenu. You can change the default of only allowing
Whitelisted sites 2 to only blocking Blacklisted ones. 3
You can also blanket block 4 or allow 5 all sites if you wish.
5
At any time, you can allow a site to play sound on
a one-off basis. Right-click the button and click Allow
This Time Only. 1 From here, you can also remove the
add-on 2 if you want all sound back, or click ‘Manage
extensions’ 3 to disable it.
6
For settings, click Options on the right-click menu.
You can turn off the pop-up prompt, 1 automatically
silence tabs moved to the background 2 and always
allow pinned tabs. 3 You can also manually add sites to your
lists by typing their URLs into the black or white boxes. 4

How to make your
smart TV even smarter
David Ludlow shows you how to use your phone to control your
smart TV, so you don’t have to rely on its clunky remote

YouTube videos. The apps on your TV
have been designed to work as well as
they can with TV remotes, but they’re
not as good as the apps you get on your
tablet or phone.
One way around this problem is to use
DIAL, a technology from Netflix and
YouTube, which lets you send YouTube
and Netflix content from your mobile
device to your smart TV without the
DIAL into your TV
Smart TVs are designed to connect to
the internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet and
stream online video straight into your
living room. Your living-room TV is a
great place to catch up with online
entertainment, since it’s more than likely
the biggest and best screen in your
house. However, TV remotes aren’t
an ideal tool for finding and selecting
need for any additional hardware.
DIAL stands for DIscovery And Launch
and is a simple way to let second-screen
devices (your phone or tablet) discover
and launch apps on first-screen devices
(your TV, Blu-ray player, set-top box and
so on). For example, you could start
watching a YouTube video on your
phone, then launch the YouTube app
on your TV and continue watching from
M
ost TVs can now
connect to your
Wi-Fi and use built-in
apps to stream videos from
the internet. But remote
controls have barely changed
since the Eighties, and are
woefully unsuited to
anything more sophisticated
than channel-hopping.
Fortunately, we now have
phones and tablets with slick
touchscreen interfaces, but
how do you link your device
to your TV? In this Weekend
Project we show you how you
can control YouTube and
Netflix on any smart TV
without having to download
extra apps, and offer a few
other options for controlling
your television from your
favourite mobile device.

there. DIAL only claims to let you
discover and launch apps on your TV,
but we’ve found that you can control
the video from your device, too.
For example, you can swipe your
device’s touchscreen to skip
through boring bits of the video
that you’re playing.
Differences to Chromecast
DIAL needs no additional
hardware, such as a Chromecast,
to stream video to your TV. Your
phone sends the location of the
stream to the receiving device,
and your TV connects directly to
the source to play it. Chromecast
works in a similar way but can
also stream content from a PC
using Google’s Chrome browser.
If you don’t have the required
DIAL app installed, your TV can
1
Check that your smart TV has the
YouTube app and is connected
to the same Wi-Fi network. On your
mobile device, choose a video to
watch and start playing it. Tap the
DIAL icon (a screen with a Wi-Fi
symbol in the bottom left corner), then
choose your TV (or other compatible
device) from the drop-down list. 1
2
You’ll get a ‘connecting’ message
at the bottom of your device’s screen
1 and the video you’re playing will
pause and darken. 2 If it isn’t already
open, the app will launch on your PC and
the video will start playing. This might
take a few moments but it’s quicker for
subsequent videos once you’ve got the
app open on the TV.
3
While the video is playing, you can
move around the interface on your
device to find something to view next.
Tap a video and you’re given the
option to interrupt the current video 1
or add it to the queue. 2 Tap the down

same Wi-Fi network. Once your TV is
playing the media, you can take over full
control on the big screen if you prefer.
With Chromecast, DRM (Digital Rights
Management) restrictions can
affect what can be beamed, which
means some content is locked.
With DIAL, if you can access the
video on your mobile device,
you can beam it to the screen –
no problem.
Is DIAL the best option?
Using DIAL from your smartphone
or tablet makes navigating and
finding content much quicker
than using a television remote,
especially when you’re typing
something to search for. Another
advantage of DIAL is that guests

you can create queues, so multiple

The drawback with DIAL is that your
TV has to have the app installed, and it
currently only works with YouTube and
Netflix. Chromecast has the advantage of
allowing you to beam video and audio
from a wider range of supported sources,
and provides more advanced options,
such as streaming from a Plex media
server to your Chromecast.
DIAL support is built into most smart
TVs, YouView boxes, games consoles
(including the PS4, PS3 and Xbox One),
Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices.
Get a touchscreen remote
If you’ve bought a smart TV from
a big-name manufacturer, the good news
is that there’s probably already an app,
developed by the manufacturer, that lets
you use a touchscreen device to control
it. At a basic level, you can simply use
these apps to switch channels, but they’ll
often also include a range of extra
functions, from playing the photos and
videos you have stored on your device
to providing a swipe-pad you can use
to navigate the TV’s apps and tools
more intuitively.
To find the right remote for your TV,
go to your app store and type in the
brand of TV followed by TV remote.
The apps from your TV manufacturer
aren’t always listed first because other
companies also make apps that will work
with more than one brand of TV. However,
it’s best to try your manufacturer’s app
first to see if it’s suitable, because the
other ones may require in-app purchases
to get the full range of tools.
We show you how to use the Panasonic
Viera app in our Mini Workshop, below.
Whatever the brand of your smart TV,
apps from other manufacturers will work
in much the same way.
Search your app store for a remote that’s
suitable for your make and model of TV

Web User’s Top Tips
In Windows 10 right-click Start and
select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
In Windows 7 right-click Windows
PowerShell on the Start menu and
select ‘Run as administrator’.
Learn new commands
To make it easier to switch from the
old Command Prompt to the new
PowerShell, many familiar commands
work as they did before. For example,
you can still type dir for a directory
listing and type cd xyz to change the
current directory to folder xyz. As with
Command Prompt, you always
have to press the Enter key when
you’ve finished typing.
For example, when you open
PowerShell, it will start in C:\Users\
YourName by default. Type cd
downloads and then dir to see
a list of the files and folders in your
Downloads folder. To delete a file,
type erase followed by the filename.
To delete a folder, type rm or rmdir
(short for remove directory) followed
by the name. To rename a file, type
ren oldname newname.
These old commands aren’t actual
PowerShell commands but aliases.
They are automatically converted into
the new commands before being run.
To see the PowerShell equivalent of
an old command, type get-alias
followed by the name. For example,
type get-alias dir and you’ll see
the real command is Get-ChildItem.
Type Get-ChildItem and it displays
a directory listing showing the files
and folders in the current location.
To see all the old commands and
their new versions, type get-alias
TOP TIPS FOR SWITCHING TO POWERSHELL
I
n this year’s Creators Update to
Windows 10, Microsoft is downgrading
Command Prompt, which has been
in Windows since the early days, and
promoting PowerShell, which is more
powerful. You don’t have to wait for the
update, though – you can use it now.
Press Windows+i and click Personalisation.
Select Taskbar on the left and look for
the switch in the settings on the right that
lets you choose between PowerShell and
Command Prompt. Currently this switch
is off, but in future Windows versions it
will be on. This switch controls whether
Command Prompt or PowerShell appears
on the menu when you right-click the Start
button or press Windows+X, and which
tool File Explorer opens. Use the switch
to turn on PowerShell and try out our tips.
PowerShell vs Command Prompt
Start PowerShell
To start PowerShell in Windows 10,
right-click the Start button and select
it from the menu, or run it from the Start
menu. PowerShell is the 64-bit version
and PowerShell (x86) is the 32-bit
version. The 64-bit version is the one
to use, presuming you’re running
a 64-bit version of Windows.
PowerShell is not new and has been
around for years. You can even run it
in Windows 7 by clicking Start,
All Programs, Accessories, Windows
PowerShell.
Like all programs, PowerShell can be
run in normal or administrator mode.
Most functions work in normal mode,
but a few require an administrator.

for PowerShell. We get you ready for the big changes

Web User’s Top Tips
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
on its own. New commands use both
upper- and lowercase letters, but they
work when typed all lowercase.
Get help with commands
PowerShell is complicated but help is
available within the software. However,
this option isn’t installed by default so
you have to add it. Open PowerShell
in administrator mode and type
update-help. It takes a few minutes
to download and install, and you’ll see
the progress at the top of the window.
Don’t worry if some things don’t install.
To use the Help system, type get-
help followed by the name of the
command you are interested in. For
example, type get-help rename-
item. If you don’t want to install the
Help files or if there is a problem
installing them, you can view online
Help instead. For example, type
get-help rename-item –online
and a browser window opens displaying
the Help page for that command.
The Help can still be confusing, so ask
it to display some examples of usage by
adding -example to the end, such as
get-help rename-item –example.
To see everything that’s known about
a command, add -full, such as
get-help rename-item –full.
Test your connection
If you’re having problems with your
internet connection, you can use
PowerShell to test it. At the PowerShell
prompt, type test-netconnection.
The results appear after a few seconds
and if everything is fine, information
such as the remote address and IP,
your computer’s IP, and the results of
a ping test (lower numbers indicate
faster internet) are displayed. Several
parameters can be included with this
command and you can specify which
website you want to check, and get
more detailed information. For example:
test-netconnection
-computername www.google.com
-informationlevel detailed
There is a related command called
test-connection, which pings
websites and devices. For example, you
can check that Google can be reached
with test-connection google.com.
Try PowerShell ISE
PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting
Environment) is a programmer’s editor
that lets you develop, test and run
PowerShell scripts. It’s included in
Windows and aims to make working
with commands and scripts easier.
Here is a simple example.
Go to the Start menu, find Windows
PowerShell in the list of all programs,
click the drop-down arrow to expand
it and click Windows PowerShell ISE.
In the Commands panel on the right,
type start into the Name box. All the
commands that include start are
listed. Select Start-Process and, in the
FilePath box below (you may need to
press ‘Show details’ to see it), enter
notepad.exe. Windows knows
where to find Notepad, but you may
need to specify the full path with
other programs.
Click the Run button at the bottom
and a PowerShell script is created,
entered and executed. Our example
simply starts Notepad and you will see
the window open. Look in the main
window and you’ll see it says Start-
Process -FilePath notepad.exe.
Typing this into a PowerShell window
would produce the same result.
Check running services
Services are special types of
programs that run in the background
and perform essential tasks. Press
Windows+R, type services.msc and
press Enter to see them. They can also
be seen in PowerShell. Type get-
service to see a list of services and
whether they are running or stopped.
List all Windows apps
To see a list of all your installed
Windows 10 or 8.1 apps, type Get-
AppxPackage. It displays very
detailed information so several
screens will fly by. Scroll back through
the screens to see all the apps.
System Restore settings
PowerShell is more powerful than
the old Command Prompt and it can
perform tasks that weren’t previously
possible. For example, you can turn
System Restore on or off with a quick
command instead of searching
through menus, windows and
settings. To enable System Restore,
type Enable-ComputerRestore.
To disable it, type Disable-
ComputerRestore.
Suppose you are going to install
some software or customise Windows
settings. It’s a good idea to use
System Restore to save the current
Windows configuration in case
anything goes wrong, so you can
put things back the way they were.
To create a restore point, open
PowerShell and type:
Checkpoint-Computer
-Description “Install app”
This creates a restore point and
names it ‘Install app’. Change the
description in quotes to whatever
best describes the restore point.
Copy files and folders
Files and folders can be copied from
one place to another, such as from
one folder to another on the hard
drive, or to another drive. You can
either type the full path to the file you
want to copy or change to the folder
first with cd. So you could open
a PowerShell window and type
cd downloads to change to it, then
copy a file to drive F: by typing
copy-item filename f:\.
Copy-Item can also be used to
copy folders but the command needs
an extra parameter to to do this. Type:
Copy-Item “C:\Folder1”
-Destination “C:\Folder2”
-Recurse
If C:\Folder2 already exists, then
the contents of Folder1 are copied
to Folder2. If Folder2 does not exist,
it is created and then the contents
of Folder1 are copied into it.
Check that the internet is working with
this PowerShell command
Use Copy-Item to copy files and whole
folders from one place to another
Use PowerShell ISE to explore the
commands available and create scripts

Recover lost email passwords
Q
I have been unable to receive email
in my Tiscali account since 2
November. I installed Windows 10 when
it was first launched and all was well
for months. I use Windows Live Mail
to read my email.
Windows 10 did not like my tiscali.co.uk
address and I had to register it with
a Hotmail address, but both Hotmail and
Tiscali addresses worked alongside each
other in Live Mail. I got a login box
requiring a password but I didn’t need
to enter it, until November. Microsoft
then started insisting I put in my
password, but it is not recognised.
I used the automated Help program,
which generated a four-digit key and
sent it to my email address, but since
I cannot access my emails, I was stuck
in an endless loop. In the end, I set up
a new Outlook.com address, from which
I am writing this.
In the days that followed, I received
key codes. When I typed them into
Windows Live Mail’s password box,
they were rejected.
When I first set up my new address,
I was intending to set up Hotmail.com,
but during setup it was automatically
changed to Outlook.com. I have lost
the original password to my Hotmail.com
address and any password I may have
had to tiscali.co.uk

We’ve had to edit your query
because it was too long to fit it all
in, but hopefully the main points remain.
Your internet provider is TalkTalk,
which took over Tiscali, and you should
be able to recover your email account
from them. Go to bit.ly/tal413 and look
at the My Account and Email sections.
These have links to recover your
account name and password, and email
password. You will also find contact
options and telephone support on
0345 172 0088.
After fixing your tiscali.co.uk email,
you can then use Outlook’s password
recovery. Go to outlook.live.com in
a browser and click ‘Sign in’. Enter your
email address and, when it asks for the
password, click ‘Forgot my password’
and follow the instructions. To contact
support, go to bit.ly/out413 in a browser.
Outlook technical support is usually only
available to paying subscribers, though.
Windows Live Mail is an old program
that is no longer supported and cannot
access Outlook or Hotmail email
accounts. The Hotmail name has been
abandoned, too. Existing Hotmail
addresses continue to work in the
webmail service but you can’t create
new accounts – you have to use Outlook
.com instead. Instead of Live Mail, try
using the Windows 10 Mail app instead.

This bug occurs for no apparent
reason and it may be that
a setting in Windows has been
wrongly changed during an update.
Utilities that configure Windows
settings may also be responsible.
Try pressing Windows+i to open
Settings, then select Privacy and
‘Feedback & diagnostics’. Set the
‘Feedback frequency’ to Automatic.
In the section ‘Diagnostic and usage
data’, select the Full option. Hopefully,
these settings are not greyed out.
On most versions of Windows
(except, unfortunately, the Home
version), you can type gpedit.msc
into the Windows search bar. Right-
click the search result and select ‘Run
as administrator’, then go to:
Computer Configuration/
Administrative Templates/Windows
Components/Data Collection and
Preview Builds
Double-click Allow Telemetry and
set it to Enabled. In the Options below,
set it to Full and click OK. If that
doesn’t work, double-click Telemetry
again and set it to Not Configured.
The setting can also be changed
using the Registry Editor. Press
Windows+R, type regedit, then
press the Enter key. Go to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
PolicyManager\default\System\

I noticed Issue 409’s Ask the

explained how to ‘Recover a lost DVD

answer to my problem. There were lots
of suggestions for things to try but none

I decided to try the Maxthon 5 web
browser (www.maxthon.com) after
reading about it in a recent edition of
Web User. It did not appeal to me
sufficiently, so I decided to remove it.
The removal process appeared to start,
but then my PC froze and I was forced
to shut it down with the power button.
I tried to restart it, but all was not well.
I tried various means including booting
in safe mode, but the computer failed
to respond and said I needed to boot up
in repair mode with an installation disc.
Prior to trying Maxthon 5, I had been
tempted to try one of your magazine’s
other suggestions, Advanced
SystemCare 10. However, I found that
the URL didn’t lead me to the software
I expected. I looked up the program’s
address myself and tried to load the
software, but my attempts always led
me to download programs other than
the one I wanted.
My computer runs Windows 7. I would
be grateful if you would advise me how
to get out of the predicament in which
I now find myself due to having
downloaded Maxthon 5. Are there issues
associated with this software? Does it
not take kindly to being removed?
Norris Lockley, via email
A
Let’s deal with the easy problem
first. Advanced SystemCare 10 is
available from IObit (www.iobit.com).
Sometimes installers from IObit try to
install trials of other IObit software, but
if you are vigilant, you can opt out.
Not being able to boot is a more
serious problem. The cause was forcibly
shutting down the computer while the
Maxathon uninstaller was working. If the
computer becomes unresponsive while
performing a task, it may be that it has
just become very slow. Always allow 30
minutes or more before holding down
the power button to force a shutdown.
Switch on the power and press the
F8 key several times until the boot menu
appears. If you can get to it, safe mode
might work, but you should also try
‘Last known good configuration’, which
uses the same settings as the last time
Windows started successfully. ‘Repair
your computer’ at the top of the screen
might also solve the problem. Select it,
select the UK keyboard and log in.
Try Startup Repair, which fixes boot
problems, and System Restore to return
to a previous Windows state.
If none of this works, boot with the

I have bought an Amazon
Prime subscription
because it was on offer and
I am looking at getting either
the Fire TV box or the Fire TV
Stick. The problem I have is
that my TV, although HDMI
1080p with HDMI and USB
ports, is not a smart TV and is about
six years old. Also, the USB port is
a standard port and the Fire TV Stick
uses micro USB.
I believe that I can get an adapter or
HDMI splitters or boxes, but what type
of USB adaptor is it? USB to micro or
micro to USB? Will either work?
Martin Fletcher, via email
A
Both the Fire TV and the Fire TV
Stick plug into the HDMI socket
on the television. It does not need to
be a smart TV and most TVs with an
HDMI socket and the ability to display
in 1,920 x 1,080 pixels resolution are
fine. The micro USB socket on the
Fire TV Stick is for the power and
is not used to connect to the TV,
though the USB ports on some TVs
will provide enough power to run it.

CD and DVD drives sometimes
disappear from Windows and the
cause is unknown. Instead of physically
removing the drive and reattaching it,
you might be able to achieve the same
result via software.
The problem could be due to
corrupted Registry entries. Press
Windows+R, type regedit and press
Enter. Navigate to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\
{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-

Right-click UpperFilters and delete it,
then also delete LowerFilters. Quit the
Registry Editor and restart Windows.
Another fix that sometimes works
is to press Windows+R, type devmgmt
.msc and press Enter to open Device
Manager. Expand DVD/CD-Rom Drives,
right-click the drive and select ‘Uninstall

Free up space on your iPhone
I have an iPhone 5S and the only
drawback to the device is that I quickly
fill its 16GB capacity. Unfortunately,
there’s no simple way to expand the
storage, but last week I stumbled across a
handy tip that might help. If you’re down
to your last few megabytes of free space,
just download a large app from the App
Store. Fallout Shelter (bit.ly/fs413), which
is 1.1GB and free to install is ideal.
When you try to download the app,
iOS automatically frees up space by
clearing cache from your other apps, a
function you can’t perform manually.
When you install Fallout Shelter, you
should see the space taken up by other
apps start to shrink. Once the cache has
been cleared, you can delete Fallout
Shelter to start using the new, free space.
Avoid downloading large apps when
using mobile data or you might end up
with a hefty bill. You should only do so
on your home broadband if you have
unlimited bandwidth.

More missing DVD drive
problems
In issue 409 (bit.ly/webuser409), Ron
O’Brien had a query about fixing a lost
DVD drive in Windows 10. After
extensively researching this matter due
to having similar problems, I wanted to
make readers aware that although there
are some easy fixes, the main problem
lies with Sony Optiarc drives. As with my
own drive, the vast majority of models
released before Windows 10 simply don’t
work, and in all likelihood, if you own one
of these drives, it is far easier to simply
replace it, as Roland Waddilove
suggested. I replaced mine with a TSST

Add Google weather app to
Home
I read a tip in Issue 399 of Web User
(bit.ly/webuser399) about adding a
Home screen shortcut to Google Now’s
weather app. Unfortunately, this option
was not available on my device and I
recently discovered that this was due to
a bug in the operating system. I’ve found
a fix for it and I love the Google weather
app so much that I no longer use other
dedicated weather apps.
To add the Google weather app to
your Home screen open the Google app,
search for weather and a full-page
weather interface loads. At this point, you
should also see
a prompt
asking you if
you want to
add it to your
home screen.
If this doesn’t
appear, tap the
app’s three-dot
button and
select ‘Add a
Home screen
shortcut’ or
select the
down arrow,
open the main
menu and
choose ‘Add to
Home screen’.
If you can’t see any of these options,
the workaround that fixed the bug for me
and several of my friends is to switch to
a second account from the Google app
(you can create one or log in with a
family member’s account, if necessary).
Now search for weather again and the
prompt will appear asking you to add it
to your home screen. Tap Add and once
the shortcut is on your Home screen, you
can switch back to your primary Google
account and even remove the additional
account altogether.

Battery calibration
A problem that many people have with
old laptops is that the battery doesn’t
hold as much charge as it used to. My
laptop got to the point where it was
shutting down, even when the battery
indicator in the taskbar was still saying
it had 30% charge left. I discovered a fix
on the HP website that seems to have
worked and the battery indicator is now
more accurate.
For anyone else with this problem,
charge up the battery to 100%, then go
to the Control Panel and click Power
Options. Click the link to ‘Create a power
plan’ and name it. Change the settings for
the power plan so that it never dims the
display, never turns off the display and
never puts the computer to sleep. Now
remove the mains lead and use the laptop
until it runs out of power and shuts down.
Leave the laptop for an hour or so,
then plug in the mains lead and charge
it to 100%. You can switch back to the
previous power plan and the battery
indicator should now be more accurate.

you recommend?
Scooby, Web User Forums
A
I would have a look at Logitech
headsets – the company produces
good-quality products at reasonable
prices. There are several in your price
range (£14.99-£24.99), most of which use
a 3.5mm jack. If you want a USB
connection, you need the H340, which is
at the higher end of that price range but
is discounted on Amazon (bit.ly/log413).
Alternatively, you could look at the
Microsoft LifeChat series of headsets.
They are usually pretty good value for
money and reasonable quality. The
LX-3000, available from Amazon for less
than £20 (bit.ly/life413), offers over-ear
type headphones, which I prefer. I would
recommend going for a USB headset if
you can afford it, because the recording
quality is usually better.

The steps you are taking should

Alternatively, you can click ‘Choose

check you can perform is to open

then scroll down to make sure that VLC

Regarding the recent correspondence in

to get a better broadband deal – I called
mine a few months back to haggle and
the guy on the phone was rubbish, for

He was quite focused on

was trying to retain me as
a customer, even offering
me a higher price with a
faster speed. These are
textbook mistakes for
working in retentions.
Speed wasn’t a factor and paying
more wasn’t either. I wanted them to
beat an offer from Vodafone, that’s all.
When I called again, I spoke with a lad
who listened to what I wanted and got

commit to more than 12 months.

Online safety is really
just common sense
I have read many letters and articles
in Web User over the years regarding
security, with people saying that we can’t
trust the internet to bank online or that
we can’t let our kids go online in their
bedrooms. The truth is that we have
always had people trying to steal our
money and prey on children. The internet
is just a different way of carrying out
these crimes.
In the old days, you would never go
to a bank, withdraw £500 cash and then
go outside and wave it around. You
would put it away safely before you left
the bank. You would never leave your
passbook lying around for all to see.
If you got a call from someone asking
you to nip down the high street,
withdraw a load of cash and then meet
them in the pub to hand it over, you
would have told them where to go.
So it is really no different today - just
use a bit of common sense and keep
your personal info personal.

the postage is very unreliable.
I usually turn to your cover feature
ﬁrst and in Issue 409 I found, staring
me in the face on page 42, the item
“Microsoft Blocks Chrome ‘For
Children’”! I have been battling with
this browser-blocking problem for
some time and, quite frankly, I am over
it. I am not a child and I don’t have
children, so I ﬁnd Microsoft’s excuse
– that other browsers don’t have
strong enough ﬁlters to “keep your
children safe” – far from satisfactory.
Can’t someone order Microsoft
to reverse this blocking? After all, I would
think this is a matter of interest to fair
trading and the competition watchdog.
It’s more than an overreaction by
Microsoft – it is an outrage!
Despite my being reasonably
computer-literate, I couldn’t ﬁnd any
way of getting to the ‘whitelist’ you
mention, other than perhaps signing
in as a child. I refuse to do that, so is
there an alternative way to unblock
browsers? I am desperate!
The only browser access I have at
present is with Edge, which is very
clunky. No wonder it is so unpopular.
Even the Favourites are awful and
have to be reopened every time you
go into the browser. Microsoft should
be ashamed of it rather than banning
everything else.
Surely there is some hacker out
there who could reverse this dreadful
situation? I just want to get on with
my research – and my life!

Said dissatisfaction crucially depends

The joy of entertainment
at your ﬁngertips
Martin Fletcher is a wet blanket who
shouldn’t be allowed near a computer,
let alone your Inbox pages. If he’s not
moaning about perfectly good security
programs (‘Malwarebytes can go to hell’,

worth about Brexit (Issue 411) and being
rude to other readers in the process.
My parents always told me “if you
haven’t got anything nice to say, don’t
say anything at all”. Mr Fletcher would
do well to take heed!
Regarding his latest comments, I’m
sure that people are well aware that there
are more important things to worry about
in the world than Spotify and BBC iPlayer.
However, in these dark times we need
entertainment more than ever, and the
convenience and variety of these services
means there’s always something new to
listen to or watch. The fact that you don’t
have to pay to use them (other than the
licence fee, of course) makes them even
better. Personally, I am pleased that we
no longer have to fork out £15 each time
we want to buy a CD or DVD. Rather
than seeing streaming services as a
reﬂection of the mediocrity of modern
life (as Mr Fletcher suggests), I regard
them as among its biggest beneﬁts
– especially when we face price rises and
cutbacks in many other areas of our lives.
So look on the bright side, and be
thankful that we have these options
available to us at our ﬁngertips.

Exploding phones soil
Samsung’s reputation
Lewis Karl Flood is right to accuse
Samsung of complacency over its
exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones (‘What
you say’, Issue 411). This is not some
two-bit company that has just emerged
on the technology scene and is offering
budget hardware to less-choosy
consumers. No, this is an extremely
successful multinational corporation that
has been around for donkey’s years and
deliberately pitches its products at the
higher end of the market.
If I pay £700 for a new phone, I expect
to be able to use it without the device
blowing up in my face, burning off my
eyebrows, singeing what remains of my
hair and choking my lungs with foul
smoke. As Lewis Karl Flood says:
Samsung knew about the exploding
battery problems but ultimately chose
proﬁt over safety testing. Despite the
proven dangers of the Galaxy Note 7
– and it’s very lucky that nobody was
seriously injured or even killed –
Samsung shamefully put its customers at
risk and its so-called apology
was as mealy-mouthed
as they come. Yet no
doubt Samsung won’t
hesitate to launch
another overpriced phone
later this year, with no
concessions for its (in my
eyes) now-soiled reputation.

HICH WEBSITE
DID YOU SPEND
MOST TIME
VISITING IN 2016?
Facebook, Web User Forums, eBay
and Mount Everest The British Story
(www.everest1953.co.uk).
Colin Wallace
That’s easy: eBay – to buy loads of
things I can’t get locally.
Gerrit Max
The AnswerBank (www.theanswerbank
.co.uk) because it’s informative, fun,
helpful and a good place for debate
Jenny Jacks @JenJacks3
YouTube. It’s fantastic for learning.
@ProfessorMesser – his channel is so
educational (bit.ly/messer413). It’s
very useful for my studies.
Pablo @abertawejack
Probably Wikipedia, to check facts
and sources.

HICH GADGET DID YOU
USE MOST IN 2016?
My iPhone because it goes
everywhere with me.
Steve Ellis @gb022621
I use an iPad the most, simply because
it’s easy to pick up and use.
K Manson @polar120
My smartphone - to plan journeys
using Google Now.
Patricia Groom @TriciaGroom
My nearly ﬁve-year-old Windows 7

WHAT WOULD IT BE?
Make it totally hack-proof. No spam,
no malware, no viruses, no Trojans, no
hacks. Bliss.

HICH OF THESE ARE YOU
MOST LIKELY TO BUY IN
2017: A NEW PHONE, TABLET,
LAPTOP OR DESKTOP PC?
A phone, because I like shiny new
things and I’m due an upgrade next
year. I might think about replacing
my ageing netbook with a
Chromebook, too.
Karl Robson
I’m buying a new laptop as mine
expired in August. I had too much to
fork out for before, which stopped me
being able to afford a new one.
Phil Graham
My old Dell PC is six years old. I fancy
a new – admittedly expensive – iMac
with the fabulous 27” screen, to use
for my photography.
Ian Phipps
None. It’s PC components for me
because I want to build a compact
gaming home-theatre PC.

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
than the people who have the
misfortune to live here, because
international roaming lets you hook
onto any available network. An
American visitor, for example, might be
on EE in London, then travel down to
a small Dorset village where only
Vodafone is available, and their phone
will automatically switch
to the new network.
British nationals, on
the other hand, are
stuck with the network
they’re contracted to,
whether that network
offers a signal in a
particular area or not.
There’s no technical
reason why British users shouldn’t be
allowed to roam across networks, as our
foreign visitors have proved. But the
mobile networks get their £30 a month
off you whether you can use your phone
or not, so why should they go to the
bother of setting up complex roaming
arrangements? Who do you think you
are? Paying customers?

get better mobile reception than we do

Shapps – and the long list of MPs in
his BIG tent – do at least appear to have
the ear of Ofcom. BIG called for BT
Openreach to be split off from the rest
of BT earlier this year, something the
regulator has since implemented. Now,
the head of Ofcom has reportedly
written to the four big mobile networks,
warning them
that people are
dissatisfied with
UK mobile
coverage and
asking them to
come up with
a solution.
It has to be
noted, there are
some downsides to national roaming.
Calls and data connections can be
dropped when you attempt to hop from
one network to another, phone battery
life can be shortened as the phone
constantly hunts for signal, and if one
network goes down, there is a chance
other networks will be flooded by the
influx of traffic.
Yet, speaking as someone who
regularly has to wander into the garden
to avoid my calls turning into a Norman
Collier tribute act, I’d definitely welcome
a shift to national roaming to deal with
notspots. And if Three had to pay 50p
to Vodafone every time I had to jump
networks to get a signal, how long do
you think it would take before they’d be
round putting up a new mast? I’d give it
about a fortnight.
In the meantime, a Lancashire-based
company called Anywhere SIM
(anywheresim.com) offers national
roaming across all four of Britain’s major
networks. It basically works by
pretending your phone is a foreigner’s.
Nobody tell the Daily Express, for
Pete’s sake…

A
s a journalist, there are
sentences you hope you’ll never
have to write, such as “Here, in
my ﬁrst column for the Daily
Express” or “It turns out that Mr Hitler
wasn’t such a bad egg, after all”.
However, there are no words in my
20-year career that have left me as
uncomfortable as the ones I’m about
to write: I agree with Grant Shapps.
The Right Honourable Mr Shapps,
should he have escaped your attention,
is a Conservative MP who famously
“over-firmly denied” having a second
job and resigned from the Cabinet after
a bullying scandal. Now, with a little
more time on his hands, he’s poked his
nose into the state of Britain’s telecoms
and – much to everyone’s surprise – has
come out with some rather sensible
recommendations.
Shapps’ British Infrastructure Group
(BIG for, erm, short) wants telecoms
regulator Ofcom to impose something
called national roaming. It rightly points
out the lunacy of foreign visitors to the
UK enjoying broader mobile coverage
