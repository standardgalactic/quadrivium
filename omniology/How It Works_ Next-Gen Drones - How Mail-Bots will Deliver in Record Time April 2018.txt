Sometimes, next-day delivery 
just isn’t quick enough. That’s 
where delivery drones come 
in, bringing goods direct to 
your door in a matter of 
minutes — at least, that’s the 
idea. Beyond shopping, these mail-bots could also 
have plenty of life-saving applications, ﬂying 
donor organs between hospitals or medical 
supplies to hard-to-reach disaster zones. But does 
reality live up to the hype? We ﬁnd out on page 12.

006  | How It Works
Showcasing the incredible world we live in
In September, Statoil and the Science 
Museum invited children from all over 
the UK to submit their ideas on how they 
would make the world a better place for the 
Young Imagineer’s competition. The amazing 
inventors of tomorrow, aged between seven and 
14 years old, submitted hundreds of creative, 
imaginative and inspirational entries, from 
devices that help you to ﬁnd your lost dog to 
companion robots to assist the elderly, and even 
artiﬁcial legs for slugs!
Ten entries were shortlisted for the ﬁnal, and 
each candidate was given the opportunity to 
work with designers to bring their ideas to life in 
a poster presentation. Our team attended the 
exciting day at the Science Museum, where the 
ﬁnalists presented their project ideas in front of 
an expert panel.
The day, hosted by broadcaster Dallas 
Campbell, celebrated some of the UK’s most 
creative and inventive minds in Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The 
Science Museum’s enthusiastic Explainer staﬀ 
demonstrated some fantastic hands-on 
experiments and workshops, from a messy guide 
of the journey your food takes as it passes 
through your digestive system, to an explanation 
of how an electric circuit is made.
We were so impressed to see the young 
inventors had invested so much time into really 
thinking about our planet’s challenges. They had 
reﬂected on issues that were beyond their 
personal experiences, tackling big, real world 
problems that might never have aﬀected them 
directly. Their projects were motivated by 
helping others with diﬀerent lives to their own. 
They designed solutions to issues such as 
securing better accessibility for people with 
disabilities to cleaning the oceans or reducing air 
pollution. Well done from the team at here How 
It Works to everyone who entered the 
competition. Your ideas blew us away! 
The awards ceremony was 
filled with exciting hands-on 
experiments, like these 
mentos rockets!

Finlay’s hover wheelchair will make the world a
better place for wheelchair users, as they’ll be able
to get up stairs and on to trains and buses without
needing to ask for help. Finlay’s idea was inspired by
seeing his nan, who struggles with stairs and public
transport, as well as his aunt, who uses a wheelchair.
His concept relies on the use of magnets to allow
wheelchair users to hover up stairs or on to public
transport. Finlay’s thoughtful invention will now be
made a reality and will be displayed outside
Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery, inside the Science
Museum, so thousands of visitors can see his project
brought to life. He will also be awarded the Children’s
Inspiration Officer position at the museum for a day,
where he will be given an exclusive guided tour of
the museum with a friend and lunch with some of
the museum Explainers. Our team loved this idea!

Darshini’s Flying Suit
Dorothy’s Starfish Sandbot
Darshini’s Flying Fuit is designed as an eco-friendly method of transport. It will 
mean less traffic and air pollution because people could just fly, and the feathers 
on the suit will clean the air as they go! The suit has a load of safety features, 
including an emergency parachute and a voice-controlled helmet that supplies 
oxygen when flying at high altitudes. Darshini really considered how she could 
make this invention good for the environment, including solar cells embedded 
into the suit to harness the power of the Sun. 
Dorothy was welcomed on to the stage and gave us a big drum roll before 
announcing her idea! Inspired by finding rubbish on the beach, Dorothy gave us 
some really startling statistics about how much plastic is clogging up our seaside 
spots. Her Starfish Sandbot — powered by bicycles — could be the solution to 
saving our seas. Once beach visitors have peddled on the stationary bikes for a 
few minutes, the robot has the power to scuttle around and pick up any rubbish 
that has been left behind. Dorothy’s idea earned her the high commended award.

COOL THINGS 
WE LEARNED 
THIS MONTH
010  |  How It Works
Antibodies can help 
reduce migraines
Migraines affect 1 billion people globally and are most 
common in those aged 25–55. Research has shown that 
antibodies are able to neutralise the migraine-triggering 
molecules, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In 
a study of 955 patients experiencing on average eight 
migraines per month, after treatment with the antibody 
erenumab 50 per cent of the patients found that they 
had half the number of migraine attacks. 
There’s currently a 
hole in the Sun
With the use of extreme ultraviolet light, NASA 
has imaged a large hole in the Sun’s corona from 
their Solar Dynamics Observatory. Find out more 
about the Sun’s ultraviolet side on page 65.
Smartphone addiction causes 
brain chemistry imbalance
A study of young people diagnosed with internet or smartphone 
addiction revealed a significantly higher ratio of the neurotransmitters 
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) to glutamate-glutamine (GIx) within 
their brains. GABA slows down the signals within the brain, whereas 
GIx electrically excites the brain’s neurons. This ratio between the two 
neurotransmitters significantly reduced once the patients underwent 
cognitive behavioural therapy.
Mussels can improve water quality
Researchers have found that ribbed mussels remove excess 
nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in urban estuaries. This 
process is known as nutrient bioextraction, with samples taken from 
the Bronx River in New York. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus 
canleadto harmful levels of algal blooms which deplete oxygen levels, and 
therefore results in the death of other organisms such as fish. Mussels are 
currently used in fish farms but may offer solutions for cleaning urban water.

Julius Caesar
invaded Britain
via Kent
New evidence has unearthed the truth 
about Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain in 
54 BCE. Archaeologists at the University 
of Leicester have found a defensive ditch 
during preliminary excavations for a 
planned road development at the hamlet 
of Ebbsfleet, Kent. Radiocarbon dating of 
artefacts suggested is was a Roman base 
dating to 1st century BCE, around the 
same time as Caesar’s invasion.
Egyptian
papyri ink 
contained copper
A study of 2,000-year-old Egyptian papyri 
fragments analysed by the University of 
Copenhagen has revealed a surprising 
element: copper. Mixed in carbon ink, it 
was identified using synchrotron radiation-
based X-ray microscopy. It is thought to be 
copper from sulphurous ores.
Nanoparticles
can fight cancer
Tiny drug-laden nanoparticles have 
been developed by researchers at the 
University of Illinois to combat rare 
cancer stem cells. Loaded with the drug 
niclosamide, these particles bind to a 
specific protein, which only appears on 
cancerouscells,topreventthestemcell

Dogs lick their mouths
around angry humans
When exposed to simulations of angry humans, 
researchers have found that dogs respond by licking their 
mouths. Researchers from the UK and Brazil exposed 
dogs to both visual and audio cues of humans and other 
dogs expressing positive and negative behaviour. The 
findings showed that dogs predominantly displayed the 
licking behaviour in response to angry humans rather 
than dogs. The team suggest that this is a behavioural 
understanding of emotional information and can 
facilitate dog-human communication.
Anti-aging proteins can  
boost immune cells
Researchers at the Gladstone Institutes have discovered another
purpose for an anti-aging protein called SIRT1. Commonly known 
for its role in protecting against age-related diseases such as 
neurodegeneration, the new study suggests that SIRT1 can also 
rejuvenate cells in the immune system. These cytotoxic T cells 
kill other cells that are infected by viruses, damaged and even 
cancerous, but as these cells age they lose SIRT1, and may begin 
producing more toxic proteins. Proposed drug developments could 
reintroduce the lost SIPR1, giving the T cells a new lease of life.
Lightning makes antimatter
Thunderstorms produce much more than a flash and boom 
according to a Japanese research team. Studying lightning 
bolts as they struck the northwest coast of Honshu, the team 
found a series of gamma radiation-releasing events. Due to a 
chain event involving the separation of neutrons, atmospheric 
nitrogen is left unstable, releasing the antimatter counterpart of 
electrons known as positrons.

The sky really is the limit
Drone safety is of the utmost importance 
when attempting to commercially use 
drones, so what are the rules? Different 
countries have different rules, but there is 
a general agreement that drones should 
not exceed altitudes of 120 metres and 
must avoid ‘No Fly Zones’ near airports. 
The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
has created the ‘Drone Code’, which sets 
out regulations for responsible drone use, 
highlighting where users can and cannot 
fly. Permits certificated by governing 
bodies such as the CAA or the US 
equivalent, the Federal Aviation Authority 
(FAA), need to be acquired in order to fly 
any new drone. 
Current UK regulations state that drones 
should not be flown out of the sight of the 
operator, which poses a direct conflict with 
the proposal for autonomous commercial 
drones. As a new and not yet operational 
service, there is a lack of laws designated 
to outlining the allowances and restrictions 
of commercial delivery drones.
Delivery drones 
must pass a permit 
exam in order to be 
commercially viable

Alphabet
Project Wing, developed by 
Google’s parent company, 
Alphabet, hope to have an entire

TRANSPORT
LIFT OFF 
The driving force behind these delivery 
innovations is to cut down on the delivery time 
of products. Prime Air and UPS both promise to 
have products with their customers within 30 
minutes. In order to meet the short delivery 
times these projects promise, how and where 
the drones take oﬀ is crucially important. 
Two methods have been explored so far. The 
ﬁrst option, being explored by Prime Air, is to 
release the drones from dispatch centres located 
around the country. Due to travelling speeds and 
built-in battery time, Amazon’s drone has a 
range of around 16 kilometres. This means 
multiple dispatch bases would be needed for a 
nationwide ﬂeet. 
UPS have taken a diﬀerent route for take oﬀ. 
Their iconic brown vans will act as the dispatch 
centre for their drones. Loaded from within the 
van, their drones will work with the road-bound 
vehicle’s navigation system to deliver parcels to 
more rural areas while a human postal worker is 
delivering by foot. The company have predicted 
that this human-drone partnership will save 
them an estimated $50 million (≈£37 million) a 
year. In a press release, UPS senior vice president 
of global engineering and sustainability Mark 
Wallace said, “This test is diﬀerent than 
anything we’ve done with drones so far. It has 
implications for future deliveries, especially in 
rural locations where our package cars often 
avel miles to make a single delivery.” 
UP IN THE AIR 
Just like any aircraft, drones have to abide by the 
laws of physics and aerodynamics. The designs 
of delivery drones appear in all shapes and 
sizes. Some house an array of rotors on a 
compact body, while others only have two, more 
resemblant of a plane. The common factor, 
however, is the use of compact rotary blades. In a 
four-rotor drone such as the Prime Air, blades 
spin in time with their diagonal counterparts. 
The thrust generated by the blades’ rotation, 
along with stabilisation technology, maintains 
the drone’s position in the air. 
However, for delivery purposes, the extra load 
carried by the drone needs to be accounted for. 
The bigger the package, the more powerful the 
drone has to be in order to carry it. The proposed 
maximum weight of a package to be carried 
successfully by drone is 2.3 kilograms. That’s 
around the same weight as a couple of pairs of 
trainers with a little room to spare. 
ON ROUTE
Once the delivery drone is in the air, current 
drone proposals describe these vehicles as 
autonomous (having the ability to not require a 
pilot), such as the Prime Air. In order for delivery 
drones to ﬂy alone they will rely on beyond-
visible line-of-sight technology. Guided by GPS 
systems, delivery drones will be able to travel 
directly to the customer’s location. 
While travelling, a prevailing concern among 
potential customers and development teams are 
the potential obstacles the drone 
may encounter. Whether it’s a bird, 
tree or even another drone,

automatic sense and avoid (SAA) systems will be

Built-in sensors and cameras will be able to

recommendations for airspace use, oﬀering a 
potential pathway for commercial drone 
activity. UPS, DHL and Amazon are continuing to 
develop new systems and strategies in order to 
perfect their drones. Amazon has even patented 
a beehive-style dispatch centre to house ﬂeets of 
delivery drones within cities. 
Over the coming years, test runs and pilot 
programmes will shape the future generation of 
drones. It is estimated that by 2021 we might see 
the beginnings of complex drone delivery 
systems in action. With some attempting 
Christmas delivery trials this year, it might not 
be long before we hear the hum of drones 
alongside the jingling of Santa’s sleigh.

to deliver medical supplies to remote areas.
Emergency treatment
When someone is experiencing a cardiac arrest, time is
of the essence. Rather than dropping off supplies, the TU
Delft ambulance drone becomes the medical delivery.

hen your job involves speeding 
around racetracks at over 200 
kilometres per hour, safety is 
paramount. In Formula series races an accident 
can be deadly, so the FIA (Fédération 
Internationale de l’Automobile, or the 
International Federation of Automobiles) 
enforces strict regulations to make sure drivers 
are well protected.
Drivers’ clothing must be ﬂame retardant to 
help shield them in the event of a ﬁre. Materials 
are subjected to stringent open ﬂame tests in 
laboratories. An artiﬁcial fabric called Nomex is 
widely used as it has excellent ﬁre-resistant 
properties and is very lightweight. Modern 
drivers’ suits are typically made from two to 
four layers of Nomex, and are thoroughly tested 
before use to ensure they can withstand 
temperatures of 600–800 degrees Celsius. To be 
suitable for use, the inside of the suit must not 
exceed 41 degrees Celsius for at least 11 seconds 
when exposed to such heat. Similarly, zips must 
also be able to withstand high temperatures so 
they do not melt or burn the driver’s skin. Even 
the threads that stitch the suit together have to 
be ﬁre resistant, as do any patches such as those 
of sponsors, although these tend to be printed 
on, which has helped to reduce the weight of 
race suits by over 500 grams. Making sure the 
suits are lightweight helps to keep drivers 
comfortable so they can perform at their best. 
Another important feature is breathability; due 
to the intense physical exertion, drivers can

How a race 
suit works
Head and neck support (HANS)
The HANS device is integral while racing. It is used to
protect Callum’s neck while driving, being held in place
by the shoulder belts of his car. The tethers link the
sides of Callum’s helmet to collar anchor points. When
G-loads build during a forward impact, the HANS
device ensures that Callum’s helmeted head moves
with his torso, so vulnerable neck and skull bones are
protected. The collar is hollow, which substantially
minimises weight and ensures maximum comfort,
while engineered reinforcements ensure an
exceptionally strong structure.
In addition to safety, engineers have to consider 
the aerodynamic impact of the driver’s helmet
Shoulder
epaulette
The shoulder epaulette
construction provides an
easy extraction system
in the event of a crash.
Race suit
Race suits are an oxymoron in a sense.
They have to be breathable so that Callum
is comfortable enough to be able to
perform at his best. They must also
possess heat- and flame-resistant
properties to provide him with enough
protection against a potential fire hazard.
Special Nomex fibre technology ensures a
highly breathable mid-layer for effective
regulation of body temperature while
ensuring the outer shell has exceptional
heat- and flame-resistant properties.
Cuff closures
Ribbed wrist and foot cuff closures
ensure a close fit, preventing unwanted
movement of the suit that could have
an impact on controlling the car.

In their 2017 season cars, Formula 1 drivers can experience G-forces of over 6G during corners

“Drivers can lose

during a race”
lose several kilos of sweat during a race, 
therefore it’s important for their comfort that 
this moisture can escape. 
Drivers’ suits are also specially designed to 
make sure their senses aren’t too restricted, 
which could interfere with their ability to 
drive. Gloves are thin to make sure drivers 
can feel the steering wheel properly, and 
their rubber-soled boots have thin, 
slip-free soles to improve contact and 
grip with the car’s pedals.
The helmet is incredibly important; 
head and neck trauma is the greatest 
injury risk among Formula racing 
drivers. They must be incredibly light, 
since the weight of the helmet 
contributes to the extreme G-forces on 
the driver’s head when accelerating, 
braking or cornering. They also need to 
be very strong in order to absorb impacts 
and resist damage in the event of a crash. 
Most helmets are made from carbon ﬁbre, 
polyethylene and aramid, combining the 
properties of high strength and ﬁre resistance, 
while also being lightweight. 
In the 2017 Formula 3 European Championship, Callum Ilott won 
seven races, made 12 podium finishes and achieved more pole 
positions than any other driver in the Formula 3 category
Race suits first and foremost keep drivers safe, but can also 
improve comfort to allow them to perform at their best
Stretch panels
Anatomical stretch
panels in the lower
back, sides, crotch, and
knees provide
increased flexibility.
Helmet
Without a doubt, Callum’s helmet is his most important
piece of race equipment. The Arai GP-6 RC helmet he uses
meets all the high-end obligatory FIA standards. It is made
from a proprietary weave of carbon fibre. This not only
makes it incredibly strong, but also flexible and incredibly
light at just 1,540 grams. All of this ensures that in the
event of a collision it does not shatter. It also includes an
emergency release system with special tabs for easy
removal should Callum have an accident.
Race boots
Made from lightweight kangaroo leather, Callum’s race boots provide
him with the highest levels of comfort and abrasion resistance. The
Nomex lining offers excellent heat resistance while the PU heel
improves comfort and is fireproof. One of the most critical aspects for
racing drivers is to be able to adequately control and feel the car. In
order to aid this the heel and insole of the boots are equipped with
microporous padding. This is coupled with a lightweight rubber sole,
which has a special textured grip for a better feel.

ave you ever wondered what the 
spinning objects mounted onto the top of 
vans are? Well, you’re looking at a 
rotating air vent. They are moving due to the 
movement of the vehicle itself or because of the 
wind, and they circulate air inside the van. They 
are generally used in vehicles that have no 
windows, particularly if the van is transporting 
food (to reduce the temperature) or if they are 
carrying animals to make sure they have 
enough fresh air to breathe. They continually 
extract the warmer air from inside and draw in 
cool air from outside. It is also a way to help keep 
the vehicle dry and free from mould.
Though these vents might not look too 
spectacular they are considered vital across 
many industries and are a practical and cheap 
way to improve the safety and comfort of vans.

a museum, exhibition spaces and a cinema, in addition to two 
iconic 48-metre-high tower blocks ﬁlled with brand new cars. 
Autostadt sits next to VW headquarters, containing an 
advanced, speciﬁcally-designed technological system for VW, to 
make the process of selling cars faster and more eﬀicient.
The towers can house 20 cars on each of the 20 levels, a total of 
400 each. This automated silo facilitates the delivery of  up to 500 
cars a day with robotic systems doing most of the hard work.

e are born well before we’re ready to
fend for ourselves, but we learn faster
in our ﬁrst three years than we will for
the rest of our lives. So how do we get from
vulnerable newborns unable to lift our own
heads to walking, talking toddlers?
BIRTH
Babies enter the world with a lot of growing left
to do. From around 35 weeks of pregnancy babies
start becoming cramped. As the foetus gets
bigger it demands more and more energy, and
there’s only so much that the mother can supply.
Before they are born, their growth starts to slow.
Entering the world for the ﬁrst time is a shock
to a baby’s system, and the ﬁrst days of life are
critical. Until the moment they emerge from the
womb, their mother’s body has supported every
Whathappenstothehumanbody
intheﬁrst12monthsoflife
one of their needs. She maintains a constant 
temperature, digests food to supply nutrients 
and breathes to supply oxygen. She also deals 
with waste and fends oﬀ infection. Then 
suddenly the baby has to fend for itself. 
As it hits the cold air of the delivery room, a 
powerful inward breath pulls its lungs open and 
ﬁlls them with air. In the safety of the womb, all 
the oxygen the baby needed came from the 
umbilical cord. The lungs were full of amniotic 
ﬂuid and the heart diverted blood past them 
through a hole called the foramen ovale and a 
tube called the ductus arteriosus. Suddenly the 
baby needs to breathe. The hole in the heart 
slams shut and blood rushes into the lungs. 
Within hours or days after birth the tube, and 
another that carried blood from the umbilical 
cord to the heart (ductus venosus), closes too.

The other organ systems also spring into 
action. The baby has been practising breathing 
and swallowing in the womb, and the kidneys 
have already started working. Within 24 hours 
the gut starts moving, passing a dark green or 
black, tarry substance called meconium. It 
contains bile, mucus, amniotic ﬂuid and 
anything else the baby has ingested in utero. 
Once this ﬂuid is out of the way milk digestion 
can begin. 
The newborn stomach is tiny — barely the 
size of a marble — so the baby needs to wake 
every few hours to feed. It can only take a few
small mouthfuls at a time. 
The mother produces a thick,
golden-yellow breast milk 
called colostrum. It’s packed
with energy but is lower in 
fat than normal breast milk, which newborns
can ﬁnd hard to digest. Instead, it’s full of protein
— perfect for a growing baby.
Colostrum has a mild laxative eﬀect, which
helps to get the baby’s gut moving, and it comes
with a secret weapon: antibodies. These
neutralise bacteria and viruses, sticking them
together and triggering their destruction.
Throughout pregnancy they cross from mother
to baby via the placenta, but this type of
immunity is only temporary. The baby will be
able to make its own, but this takes a few
months. In the meantime, colostrum provides a
boost, helping to stave oﬀ infection.
The newborn has some tricks of its own to help
it survive this vulnerable time. Though they
have a lot to learn, babies are born with some
vital reﬂexes built in. These include simple
things like blinking, swallowing and yawning, 
along with more complicated responses. 
The rooting reﬂex makes the baby turn their 
head or open their mouth when something 
touches their cheek or lip, and the suck reﬂex 
makes them suck if something touches the 
roof of their mouth. These instincts help 
with feeding. 
Then there are the Moro reﬂex and the 
palmar grasp reﬂex. The ﬁrst happens when 
a baby feels as if they are falling. They extend 
their arms and legs and arch their backs 
before curling up. The second makes the ﬁngers
and toes curl if you touch the palm of their hand
or the soles of their feet. Together they help the
baby to survive. 
FIRST WEEKS
Brand new babies can hear and
respond to noises and are born
with the beginnings of
communication. They will turn
their head towards light and sound, make out
the face of the person holding them and cry
when they are in need. It only takes a few weeks
for these skills to start to improve. They rapidly
start to recognise the voice of their mother, and
soon they begin to make diﬀerent noises, cooing
and gurgling as well as crying.
For the ﬁrst few weeks babies can only focus
on objects right in front of their faces, and their
eyes frequently cross. At this stage their
hand-eye coordination is poor. Very young
babies will investigate their own hands and
ﬁngers, but they can’t yet use them properly, and
they often keep their hands in ﬁsts.
Inside, their bodies are undergoing rapid
change fuelled by milk. If the baby is being
breastfed, normal breast milk has now replaced
colostrum. It’s higher in fat and contains
enzymes that help the digestive system to access
the nutrients. It’s also packed with sugars. Not 
only do these provide energy, they also help 
friendly bacteria to colonise the large intestine.
“Babies are 
born with vital 
reflexes built in”
Why do babies 
sleep so much?
Brand new infants spend around 16 hours a 
day in the land of nod. At first they wake often 
to feed, but by the time they are 12 weeks old 
and weigh on average 5.7 kilograms they begin 
to sleep for longer periods. 
Like adults, babies cycle through four sleep 
stages. They begin with the lightest dozing 
before a gradual drop into the deepest 
slumber, and this rhythm starts when they are 
still in the womb. Between these cycles they 
go through phases of rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep, spending up to half of their sleep 
time dreaming.
Early work suggests that sleep is important 
for consolidating learning and for brain 
plasticity. In other words, it helps with the 
strengthening and pruning of connections 
between different nerve pathways in the brain. 
Some studies suggest that inadequate sleep 
may cause problems in the refinement of nerve 
connections. However, it’s still early days and 
scientists need to do more research to confirm 
these findings.
TWO MONTHS OLD
Babies spend much of their time eating and 
sleeping, and their bodies start to grow rapidly. 
In the womb, cells divide constantly to form 
tissues and organs, but after birth growth shifts. 
Rather than making new cells, babies increase 
the size of the cells they already have. 
The tissues of newborn babies are very 
diﬀerent to those of children and adults. There is 
more ﬂuid around their muscle and nerve cells, 
and they have less cytoplasm inside. As the baby 
develops this balance shifts. Muscle cells 
expand, ﬁlling with cytoplasm and molecules 
involved in contraction. Nerve cells extend, 
strengthening connections and making new 
ones, and the amount of ﬂuid outside these cells 
starts to fall. With newfound strength, babies 
learn to push up with their hands when placed 
on their tummies and start to hold their head a 
little steadier, their movements becoming less 
jerky and more coordinated. 
Fat continues to quickly build up under the 
skin, helping to keep the infant warm. By the

two month mark babies are already starting to 
develop social skills. They begin to follow things 
with their eyes and recognise people at a 
distance, and they begin to smile and laugh.
HALFWAY THROUGH
Babies can ﬁnally hold their heads steady at 
around 16 weeks of age. They will also start to 
push down with their legs if they’re held above 
a hard surface, and by six months they can roll 
over, push up to a crawling position and even 
stand with support. 
At around this time babies also begin to use 
their hands and eyes together. They reach for 
objects and rake with their ﬁngers to grab them, 
and they start to use their mouths to explore 
objects further. With all this extra strength and 
coordination, the grasp and Moro reﬂexes are no 
longer needed. These early fail-safes fade away. 
Babies start to learn to pass toys from one hand
to the other.
Their eyesight improves too. By this stage they
are becoming more perceptive to the subtleties
of diﬀerent colours, and they start to copy facial
movements. They recognise and express
emotion and begin to
ﬁnd their voice. They
blow raspberries and
start to make consonant
sounds like ‘ba’, ‘da’ and
‘ga’, using noise to get
attention and to express
themselves. They will
also start to recognise words, especially their
own name.
To fuel all this progress, six-month-old infants
often switch to solid food. As the baby grows, the
fat content of breast milk has been increasing
from about 2g/dL of colostrum (grams per
decilitre, equivalent to 100 millilitres) to 4.9g/dL.
It has provided energy and contributed to a 
growing store of fat under the skin. But now the 
digestive system is ready for more.
A newborn’s digestive organs are not only 
smaller than an adult’s, but they also work 
diﬀerently. They make diﬀerent quantities of 
enzymes and bile and they operate at a diﬀerent 
pH. But at six months old things are starting to 
change. The ﬁrst teeth come through, starting 
with the bottom front teeth then the top. 
Swallowing improves and the digestive system 
will start to produce enzymes to break down 
complicated meals.
FIRST BIRTHDAY
By their ﬁrst birthday, babies are starting to 
develop complex behaviours. They have 
favourite things and favourite people. They start 
to understand ‘object permanence’ — the idea 
that objects and people exist even though you
can’t always see them. They look for hidden
objects and they begin to grasp the eﬀects of
gravity by learning to drop things and watching
how they fall to the ground.
They also begin to respond to requests and
make demands of their
own. They will copy
and use gestures like
waving, pointing and
head shaking. By now
they will also
understand familiar
words and follow
simple directions, as well as being able to help
with tasks like dressing. Most importantly of all,
they will start to communicate using ‘babble’.
Their coordination has by now improved too.
The grasp reﬂex is long gone, and they can move
objects easily from one hand to the other. They
can pick up small things between their thumb
and foreﬁnger and they will test new objects by 
shaking and banging. They will begin cruising, 
holding on to objects and moving around on two 
legs. Some may even take their ﬁrst steps. 
The hole that shunted blood through the heart 
when they were born is now fully healed over. 
Back teeth are starting to come through and the 
digestive system is processing full meals. The 
lungs have more air sacs, increasing surface area 
for gas exchange, and the brain has developed 
billions upon billions of new connections. 
Over the coming months, babies transform 
into toddlers. As they begin to develop their 
understanding of the world, they start wanting 
to be more independent. They learn to walk, 
they start to talk and they even play games. 
Human babies are born tiny and vulnerable, but 
in a few short months they are already well on 
the way to growing up.

ave you ever woken up in the morning to 
your arm feeling tingly and numb? 
Normal sensation always returns, but it 
can take a while before you gain full control of 
your limb again. This feeling is referred to as a 
part of your body ‘falling asleep’. It can happen 
when you cross your legs in an unusual position 
or if you accidentally spend some time sitting on 
your foot. When you apply direct pressure to a 
limb over a sustained period of time, you  
squeeze the nerves, which prevents electrical 
signals being transmitted through. At the same
time you’re also putting pressure on the blood
vessels which supply these nerves. This means
that information is not ﬂowing correctly from

misinterpreting the signals, meaning we feel
odd things like warmness, numbness or the

are overlapped. As we grow into adults those 
connections are pruned apart, but it is thought 
this process is interrupted somewhat for those 
with synesthesia. There have been over 60 forms 
of synesthesia reported, one of the most 
common being ‘grapheme-colour’ synesthesia. 
People with this type of the condition see colours 
in association with letters and numbers. 
However, there is no standard for this 
association; not every ‘A’ is red for everyone with 
the condition. 
This blending of sensory information extends 
to other senses, such as seeing the colour of 
sound. One participant in a study of lexical-
gustatory synesthesia (the ability to taste words) 
said they tasted Dutch chocolate when shown an 
image of a phonograph. Those with number-
form synesthesia see numbers in physical space 
in varying forms and shapes. Many synesthetes 
may have more than one type of synesthesia, 
and quite often people aren’t even aware they 
have the condition. So ask yourself, how do you 
see the alphabet, and what colour is it?
Grey matter
Different sections of the brain are responsible for
our perception of senses.
1
A possible cause
The dominant theory on the cause of synesthesia
is the lack of pruning and continual commutation
between these connecting regions, known as
cross-activation. It’s thought to be hereditary.
4
Neuronal pruning
In normal development, the connections to the
neural regions that control vision and hearing, for
example, grow apart by the age 4 months or so.
3
Multisensory experience
The cross-activation between two or more
regions allows a synesthete to experience
multiple senses at the same time.
5
Interconnected senses
At birth, neural connections between different 
senses overlap. In synesthetes some of this 
overlapping remains into adulthood.

Moments come into play when forces
act on an object that has a fixed point.
For example, turning a door handle,
sitting on a seesaw or closing a pair of
scissors. When forces are applied to
these objects they rotate around their
fixed point, also known as the pivot or
fulcrum. The ‘moment’ is the turning
effect of the force. It tells us how much
the object will rotate and in which
direction. Put simply, a moment is a
twist. It is also known as torque.
To calculate a moment you need to know
two things: the force (which is measured
in Newtons) and the perpendicular
distance between the pivot to the line of
action of the force (which is measured in
metres). When you multiply these two
numbers you get the moment, which is
measured in Newton metres (Nm).
For example, a seesaw has a pivot at
the centre. If a person sits on one end, the
moment can be calculated by taking the
force of their weight on the seat and
multiplying it by the distance from the
seat to the middle of the seesaw.
Moments also have a direction, either
clockwise or anticlockwise. When no one
is sitting on the seesaw, the moments in
both directions are equal. But when one
person sits down the seesaw moves. If
another person joins them by sitting on
the other end, their body weight creates a
moment in the opposite direction.

Moments don’t have to be on opposite sides
of the pivot, eithe . A heavy load in a
wheelbarrow is close to the wheel, while the
handles are further away. This means that
you need less force in order to lift the
contents. Understanding the simple
principles of moments makes everyday tasks
an awful lot easier to perform.
Moments are the turning effects of
forces. They have a direction, either
clockwise or anticlockwise, and they
can be calculated by multiplying the
force exerted by its distance from
the pivot.

HOW COME I ALWAYS
HAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT?
You’ve stuffed yourself at dinner but suddenly find
extra room for pudding. Luckily, science can explain this
phenomenon. “This has been described as taste
specific satiety,” explains Duane Mellor. This is basically
the idea of getting bored of one type of food and
wanting another.
Habituation theory also suggests that exposure to a
variety of foods act as a stimuli; unlike the main meal,
dessert is offers different flavours and textures, so
although you’re full, you are not sated. Mellor continues,
“Some have also suggested that it is so we get a range
of foods and, in theory, a range of nutrients.”
WHY DO RED
SWEETS TASTE
THE BEST?
A surprising majority of sweets are red
due to an inbuilt mental link with the
ripeness of fruit. People are naturally
drawn to red sweets because our
brain links red with sweetness.
Duane Mellor explains, “We do
seem to ‘taste’ colour, so lemon- or
orange-flavoured things that are
coloured green will be said to taste
like lime and more sour. Red things are
associated with ripe berries, so we
think of strawberries and cherries, so
that is often more pleasant than green
or yellow ones.”
So when choosing a sweet, your
sensory organs are naturally drawn to
the red ones as your brain has
identified them as the sweetest.
CAN YOU SAFELY REHEAT RICE?
In a word, yes. Many people believe reheating rice causes food poisoning, but it’s the cooling
of the rice rather than the heating that affects whether or not it’s safe to eat. Uncooked rice
can contain spores of the bacterial species Bacillus cereus. They aren’t a concern during the
initial cooking and eating process, but if left cooling at room temperature these spores can
grow into bacteria. These bacteria multiply, producing toxins which can cause food poisoning.
Don’t be fooled into thinking you can kill the spores off by reheating the rice, as the hardy
bacteria can easily survive temperatures of up to 100 degrees Celsius. The best thing to do is
to cool the rice quickly and store it in an airtight container. This prevents the spores from
growing into bacteria, so as long as you thoroughly reheat your rice to kill off any other
bacteria, it’s safe to eat.

WHY CAN STEAK BE EATEN RARE
BUT NOT BURGERS OR CHICKEN?
Bacteria, such as salmonella and E coli, and other parasites live in the
guts of animals and can be transferred to their flesh during the
slaughter process. If ingested they can cause diarrhoea, vomiting and
cramps. Cooking meat for 45 minutes, with the internal temperature
reaching at least 60 degrees Celsius, should be enough to kill off
those bacteria, so thoroughly cooking chicken (and other poultry) all
the way through should be safe. Steak, however, is cut from the
muscle of the cow, not the flesh so as long as the outside is seared to
kill off any surface-lurking bacteria, rare steak should be safe to eat.
Burgers shouldn’t be eaten rare as contamination could occur while
the meat is being minced, so treat your burgers the same way you
would a piece of chicken and cook them thoroughly.
WHY IS MELTED
CHEESE SO
DELICIOUS?
In 2011 Oxfam asked a cross-section
of people from 17 countries what
their favourite food was. Cheese
made the list just once, coming in at
11th in the UK. However, pizza
appeared on the list in 12 countries.
Is it the dough? Is it the tomato? Or is
it the melted cheese that makes
pizza so universally popular?
The cheese begins to melt at
about 32 degrees Celsius as the milk
proteins liquefy. Then at around 54
degrees Celsius the milk proteins
break down entirely, leaving a thick
creamy, gooey substance.
Creaminess is a soft texture our
mouths love, while the warmth of the
melted cheese also appeals, making
melted cheese infinitely better than
its hard, cold original form.
SHOULD SANDWICHES BE CUT
INTO RECTANGLES OR TRIANGLES?
This debate has dominated lunchtimes for generations but, while a
recent YouGov poll found 60 per cent of Brits cut their sandwiches
into rectangles, it can be put to bed thanks to that champion of the
triangle — Pythagoras. Cutting a 9x12-centimetre sandwich into two
rectangles provides 21 centimetres of crust per half and nine
centimetres of non-crust. Cutting it into triangles, however, still
provides 21 centimetres of crust per half but 15 centimetres of
non-crust, an increase of over 65 per cent.
Even if you aren’t fussed by the amount of crust, cutting your
sandwich into a triangle exposes much more surface area of
sandwich filling right from the start, engaging more of your senses,
stimulating more of your taste buds, improving the first bite and
making for a better sandwich experience.
WHY DO KIDS
HATE BROCCOLI?
Broccoli contains a glucosinolate compound that
makes it taste bitter. The human gene
TAS2R38 is responsible for sensing
bitterness in food, and is more
dominant in some people than
others, so they’re more
sensitive to the bitter
compound and more likely to
dislike broccoli. Children have
around twice as many taste buds
as adults, so if they’ve got a version
of the dominant TAS2R38 gene then
broccoli can taste horrible.
However, as they get older the
number of taste buds on their
tongue can reduce, and
theoretically this bitter taste
will be less potent.
Duane Mellor, senior
lecturer in Human
Nutrition at Coventry
University, also points
out, “This bitter taste is
thought to be protective.
We are almost conditioned not
to like bitter flavours as some
bitter compounds can be toxic.”
As long as the burger isn’t  
rare, this meal choice is no 
contest for young taste buds

where it becomes contaminated by nuclear
material. This then drops back to the surface

several kilometres and such tiny particles could

The UK Warning and Monitoring Organisation built over 3,000 nuclear bunkers, some of which are for sale
DID YOU KNOW? 
U
ntil recently, nuclear bunkers were 
considered relics of the Cold War, as 
indeed most of them are. But with 
increasing tension between North Korea and the 
US, perhaps these fallout shelters don’t seem 
quite so irrelevant any more. Here we delve into 
the world of nuclear bunkers, with particular 
reference to those large facilities designed to 
provide military and governmental control 
centres in the event of conﬂict.
Although the threat of nuclear war tends to be 
associated with the period between the end of 
the Second World War and the breakup of the 
Soviet Union in 1991, nuclear bunkers can trace 
their heritage back to earlier conﬂicts. The 
phrase ‘trench warfare’ epitomises the First 
World War, but excavations in Flanders Fields 
also included underground bunkers that were 
used as command centres, shelters and stores for 
ammunition and food. However, it was due to 
the threat of bombing to the UK during the 
Second World War that underground defences 
really got a foothold. These sub-surface 
structures ranged from large facilities — such as 
Churchill’s well-known Cabinet War Rooms — to 
the Anderson shelters that people were 
encouraged to bury in their own gardens to 
provide protection against air raids.
The design of a bunker capable of protecting 
its inhabitants from a conventional bomb isn’t 
too demanding. Unless it suﬀers a direct hit, the 
protection aﬀorded by a few metres of earth is
generally adequate to prevent severe injury. As
we turn our attention to a bunker capable of
oﬀering immunity from a nuclear attack, though,
the requirements become a lot more stringent,
as will become evident if we think about the
result of a nuclear explosion.
First of all there’d be an explosive force that
would be much more powerful than that caused
by a conventional bomb. A nuclear blast would
result in a hugely powerful shock wave,
eﬀectively a blast of wind that could exceed 1,000
kilometres per hour, plus the risk of falling

many hundreds of kilometres) could be

The implication of this is that, while nuclear
bunkers certainly need to oﬀer protection
against a powerful blast, they also need to

BBC’s Wartime Broadcasting System
To provide a service in the event of nuclear war, 
from the 1950s the BBC drew up plans for a 
Wartime Broadcasting Service. Around the 
country were 11 regional seats of government, 
housed in protected bunkers; the BBC had a 
studio in each, manned by staff from local radio 
stations. Overall control would have been from a 
bunker at the Engineering Training Department at 
Wood Norton in Worcestershire.
According to a recent BBC report following 
declassification of the service, the most recent 
recorded announcement by Radio 4 newsreader 
Peter Donaldson contained the statement, “This 
is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This 
country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. 
Communications have been severely disrupted, 
and the number of casualties and the extent of 
the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you 
further information as soon as possible. 
Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay 
calm and stay in your own homes. There is 
nothing to be gained by trying to get away.”

perhaps up to a year, until the 
surrounding area recovers suﬀiciently 
to permit human habitation. Nuclear 
bunkers, especially those used for 
military and government purposes, also 
require communication capabilities. 
Among other things, a bunker would require
protection from an EMP — that is a Electro-
Magnetic Pulse that would shut down any
electronic equipment unless it was properly
protected against such an event.
Advice on the construction of a bunker 
capable of providing protection against nuclear 
attack was published in 1979 by America’s Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory. Generally speaking, 
blast protection is achieved with adequate 
ground cover, perhaps by digging the shelter 
and then building an arched roof capable of 
supporting the weight of a mound of earth that 
covers the bunker. This cover of earth will also 
oﬀer a good degree of protection against 
radiation risks. The advice gave particular 
attention to the door, which would otherwise 
undermine the protection. In particular, a blast 
door is needed to keep out blast waves, blast 
wind, over-pressure, blast-borne debris, 
burning hot dust and fallout. Some advice also 
suggested making tunnels as  labyrinthine as 
possible as means of reducing the amount of 
radiation entering the shelter through them.
Moving beyond the immediate eﬀect of the 
blast, advice was given on the provision of a 
living space for prolonged occupation. This 
meant stockpiling food that would last for 
months, perhaps even longer, and also 
providing an adequate supply of water. The air 
supply is also an issue, which means that an air 
pump and ﬁltration system would have been 
required. Because of the uncertainty over the 
survival of power generation and mains 
distribution facilities, provision was required for 
manual operation.

HISTORY
While Second World War air raid shelters were
intended to protect civilians, Cold War nuclear 
bunkers tended to be much larger facilities 
designed for military and governmental 
purposes. A list of over 700 disused 
establishments compiled by Subterranea 
Britannica reveals a broad range of purposes 
including national and regional war rooms, civil
defence, communication facilities (including 
radio transmitting stations and telephone 
exchanges), water supplies, central and local 
government, ﬁghter command and radar. A 
similar approach to providing protection for 
essential defence services was also taken in the 
US, the construction of the Cheyenne Mountain 
Complex being just one example.
It would be interesting to know how these 
large bunkers in the UK and the US would be 
used in the event of a nuclear threat, but 
needless to say, information is scant. Bearing in 
mind the furore following the recent discovery 
of a memory stick containing details of the route
routinely taken by the queen from Buckingham 
Palace to Heathrow Airport, we can only 
imagine the level of secrecy surrounding such 
contingency plans. However, a few facts have 
come to light concerning the most recent use of a
bunker at the White House during the terrorist 
attacks on New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania 
on 11 September 2001. 
According to the reports, on
realising the potential risk, Vice
President Dick Cheney was 
taken by the Secret Service 
from his White House

Center (PEOC) below the

some of the world’s largest corporations, such

since President Bush was travelling in Florida, 
so the response was not typical. Instead, George 
W Bush took to the skies aboard Air Force One, 
escorted by three F-16 ﬁghters, from where he 
managed the response to the attack in the 
‘Airborne Oval Oﬀice’.
In the UK and many other countries, nuclear 
bunkers were intended mainly to permit 
military and government operations to continue. 
Elsewhere, though, bunkers are suﬀiciently 
plentiful to provide a safe haven for a signiﬁcant 
proportion of the population. Switzerland is the 
ultimate example, with laws in place since the 
1960s ensuring that all new buildings are 
equipped withfallout shelters. As a result, 100 
per cent of the population is now catered for, 
either in their own bunkers or in large-scale 
facilities designed for civilian protection. In 
other countries this level of preparedness might 
not be guaranteed, but this hasn’t stopped 
people from taking precautions. 
Some companies oﬀering private nuclear 
shelters are currently reporting more orders per 
month than they received during the whole of 
2016. And some of these are pretty lavish, 
providing a bit of luxury during those months of 
isolation. For between $1.5 and $4 million you 
can buy an apartment in an underground 
facility protected against the eﬀects 
of a nuclear attack, with 
amenities including a 
cinema, indoor pool and 
spa, medical centre, bar, 
gym and library. Now 
surely that’s the ultimate 
status symbol.

ooming out of the sea oﬀthe west coast of
France is an eerie stone fortress. Cut oﬀ
entirely from the mainland, the small
castle appears to be impossibly ﬂoating on the
waves, keeping watch over the military port of
Rochefort and the Charente Estuary. In fact, Fort
Boyard is ﬁxed to a rocky bank, which at high
tide is hidden entirely from view — an incredible
feat of engineering that has stood for over 150
years, against all the odds.
At the end of the 17th century, plans were
drawn up for a sea fort that could protect the
military base at nearby 
Rochefort from enemy raids.
However, the project was 
abandoned in 1692 after the
enormous ﬁnancial cost was
realised. Sébastien Vauban, a
distinguished French military
engineer, said of the planned
fort, “It would be easier to 
seize the Moon with your teeth than to attempt
such an undertaking.”
During the Seven Years’ War (1756-63) new
plans for the structure were made, but once
again these were abandoned, and it was not
until 1804 that the ﬁrst foundations of Fort
Boyard were ﬁnally laid. Piles of rubble and
stone were sunk into the natural sand and stone
bank to form a ﬁrm, ﬂat base on which the fort
could be built. This process alone was
painstakingly slow, as work could only continue

The fort is 20 metres high and has five separate

is revealed. In the winter of 1807-8, disaster 
struck when these foundations were washed 
away by a series of powerful storms, and in 1809 
construction work stopped altogether. 
It wasn’t until 1857 that Fort Boyard was ﬁnally 
completed. Standing 20 metres high and armed 
with 74 cannons over three ﬂoors, the new fort 
resembled an impregnable battleship made of 
solid stone. Its oval design meant its guns could 
command a ﬁeld of ﬁre all across the 
surrounding area, protecting the harbour from 
any enemy incursions. It 
contained stores and living 
quarters to support an armed 
garrison of up to 250 soldiers. 
Ironically, in the time it had 
taken to be built, increasingly 
long-range cannons had 
quashed Fort Boyard’s use as 
a credible naval defence. For a 
short time the building was therefore used as a 
prison, but by the turn of the century even this 
function was no longer required. The structure 
gradually fell into disrepair and ruin, until in 
1990 it found an unlikely saviour. Fort Boyard 
became the ﬁlming location for a popular French 
game show of the same name, and received 
some much-needed restoration. Rendered 
redundant as a bulwark of France’s defence, the 
fortress’ newfound fame has, at least for now, 
secured its short-term future.

hen the Romans invaded Britain in 43 
CE, they brought with them all the 
trappings of civilised living: walled 
cities, literacy, sanitation — and pubs. Known as 
tabernae — the origin of the English word 
‘tavern’ — these establishments sold wine to 
thirsty workers and soldiers. However, as the 
Romans left and the Anglo-Saxons settled in the 
British Isles, ale became the tipple of choice. 
Brewers opened up their homes as alehouses, 
which grew so popular that in 965 King Edgar I 
restricted them to one per village. 
These taverns and alehouses continued to 
adapt. When the Normans conquered Britain in 
1066, newly built monasteries began brewing 
their own beer to sell to weary pilgrims, while 
nearby inns oﬀered refreshment and rest to 
travellers on the road to holy sites in Britain  
and beyond. 
In 1393 King Richard II ordered that all 
drinking establishments must display a sign 
outdoors — normally an illustration as the 
majority of people were illiterate. These signs 
would usually have religious themes, with 
images of saints and angels, but this became 
taboo in the 16th century when King Henry VIII 
broke from the Roman Catholic Church. Cautious 
innkeepers were quick to show their loyalty to 
the monarch by changing the names of their 
premises, adopting royal names such as The 
King’s Arms or The Greyhound — appealing to 
the Tudor tyrant’s love of hunting. 
In 1552, the Alehouse Act was passed by the 
monarch, which stated that a licence provided 
by the local Justice of Peace was needed in order 
to sell beer or wine. But this legislation didn’t 
stop pubs from continuing to boom, with many 
later naming themselves The Red Lion in honour 
of King James VI of Scotland acceding to the 
throne of England in 1603. 
Beer was often cleaner than water and 
cheaper than tea, with alcoholic drinking 
remaining widespread in Victorian Britain even 
after the temperance movement. These public 
houses — shortened to ‘pubs’ — featured 
new-fangled beer engines that could pump the 
liquid from underground cellars to customers’ 
glasses in seconds. As drinking cultures 
changed during the 19th century, venues 
diversiﬁed into gin palaces, music halls and 
nightclubs, but the British public hasn’t called 
time on the traditional pub just yet

H
ave you ever wondered how fruit and 
vegetables make it from crop to shop? 
Whether we’re enjoying the tropical 
taste of papaya from Hawaii or savouring 
steamed spinach from west Asia, we have 
agricultural engineers to thank for being able to 
enjoy food from the opposite side of the planet. 
These specialists are responsible for tackling the 
massive challenges associated with feeding 
more people than ever before using limited land. 
During the 1960s, each farmer produced 
enough food to feed approximately 26 people. 
Due to an increase in demand today’s farmer 
feeds around 155 worldwide. However, by 2050 it 
is estimated that the global population could 
reach 9.8 billion, and food production will have 
to increase by around 70 per cent to feed all of 
these extra mouths. But when the going gets 
tough, agricultural engineers help farmers to get
growing with creative solutions.
By 2050, it is predicted that advancements in
agricultural technology will mean that each
farmer will need to feed over 265 people. Work
has begun to change the way we farm — from
modernising growth substrates and designing
new crop storage solutions to optimising
conditions for indoor growth. It is hoped that
these measures will make for a more
sustainable future by increasing food
security, reducing global farmland
demands and decreasing deforestation.
PRECISION AGRICULTURE
Precision agriculture is a modern farming
practice that aims to increase the eﬀiciency of
produce production through the use of
technology, in order to provide more tailored
crop treatments. This method makes use of
satellite imagery, sensors to monitor crop health
and variable-rate technology monitoring water
and fertiliser applications.
The birth of the precision agriculture industry
came with the introduction of GPS-guided
tractors during the early 1990s. This enables the
vehicles to navigate themselves according to the
coordinates of a ﬁeld, and also allows farmers to
work during low visibility conditions. These
systems have revolutionised how crops are
planted and how fertiliser is distributed, as it
“It is predicted that advancements in
agricultural technology will mean that each
farmer will need to feed over 265 people”
results in less wasted seed, fertiliser, fuel, time
and ultimately money.
Most modern farms now utilise GPS-steered
tractors, along with a series of sensors to help
measure the soil quality. By recording
temperature, moisture and nutrient data, entire
ﬁelds can be mapped out according to the crop
yield, allowing farmers to adjust their practices
to help improve struggling areas of produce. For
example, additional water and fertiliser could
be provided to sections struggling with growth,
while lessening the supply to areas where the
produce is already thriving.
The data processed in precision agricultural
systems is being used around the world to
optimise farms, from predicting the best time to
harvest a crop to anticipating outbreaks of pests
and disease before they impact the produce.
VERTICAL FARMS
The rapidly increasing human population brings
a whole host of challenges for our planet. A major
problem will be providing enough food for these
additional people with the amount of farmable
land we currently have available. Vertical farms
are one of the engineered solutions that have
been developed to help tackle this problem. By
growing produce in space-saving stacked layers,
we can make use of vertical space, growing
upwards rather than outwards increasing the
productivity of a farmed area by a factor of four
to six. This innovative approach has been hailed
Hydroponic farming
Hydroponic growth methods are unique because they are performed without the use of soil.  
This modern approach utilises mineral nutrient solutions to provide nourishment to the 
plant via its roots. Plants can be cultivated by directly establishing their roots into liquid 
media, although most high-tech systems suspend the roots in a nutrient-rich mist (known 
as aeroponics). Both methods reduce the risk of disease from soil based organisms, and 
theoretically allow agriculturalists to grow any crop in any location.  
As plants grown hydroponically do not require an extensive root network to extract 
minerals from soil, more energy can be diverted to leaf and fruit growth, resulting in a 
higher yield and improved growth of the crop.

efficient, productive and versatile

as the ‘third green revolution’ and aims to 
produce fresh food in sub-optimal conditions, 
such as within high-altitude mountain towns, 
dry deserts and dense cities. The latter is 
particularly important, as experts predict that 
two-thirds of the global population will be living 
in urban areas by 2050. Vertical farming will be 
required to help provide fresh, local produce for 
the world’s growing urban populations.  
Typically, vertical farms use hydroponic 
systems, which involve growing plants without 
soil. Instead, their roots are suspended in a 
nutrient-rich water supply.  Aeroponic methods 
— in which plants’ roots are suspended in a 
nutrient-rich mist — further reduce water 
requirements as well as weight. 
Vertical farms tend to make use of artiﬁcial
light sources, increasingly using light-emitting
diode (LED) lamps as a compact and energy
eﬀicient source. However, sizeable electricity
bills can make vertical farming an unattractive
option. These indoor, highly-controlled
environments help farmers to establish
optimum conditions for the rapid and healthy
growth of produce in a way that would not be
possible on a traditional farm.
GENETIC MODIFICATION
Genetic modiﬁcation has been recognised as the
innovation that could potentially solve world
hunger. Drought, disease and pests aﬀect crops
around the globe. Currently, the rate of increase
in crop-yield is less than 1.7 per cent, whereas the
annual increase needs to be 2.4 per cent to meet
demands of a growing population and
nutritional standards. It is generally accepted
that the solution to these obstacles could be the
widespread introduction of genetically modiﬁed
crops, made possible by engineering the plants
to thrive in sub-optimal conditions.

How would you describe the job of an 
agricultural engineer? 
I often feel that the agricultural engineer is the 
Swiss Army knife of engineers because there are
many facets to agricultural engineering. They 
have the tools to help society tackle some of the 
biggest challenges, be that mitigating the eﬀects
of climate change or ensuring food security.
 
What challenges are engineers facing,  
and what examples are there of  
overcoming them?
One particular challenge would be around what
we call site-speciﬁc agriculture. Historically, we 
apply pesticides as a blanket across the crop 
— it’s not particularly eﬀicient but it works. But 
now there is a lot of work being done about 
applying agricultural chemicals speciﬁcally to 
the area of need — so by the use of cameras to 
identify maybe a black grass weed infestation or
a fungus and applying the chemical directly to 
the problem. This reduces pollution and is much
more eﬀicient. You can scan a ﬁeld, identify an 
area that needs treatment and only treat the 
problem rather than the whole ﬁeld.
Andy Newbold is a 
chartered agricultural 
engineer and founder of 
FarmSmart Events. 
Previously the president 
of the Institution of 
Agricultural Engineers 
(IAgrE), he spoke to How 
It Works about the future
of farming, the food 
challenges we face and 
how to overcome them
with agricultural
engineer Andy Newbold
What do agricultural engineering solutions 
look like at the moment?
The technology is proven regarding auto-steer 
guidance, driverless tractors and things like 
that. The next challenge is to deal with public 
acceptance. So it’s one thing in the prairies of 
Iowa or somewhere, but the moment you see a 
combine without a driver tootling around 
Guildford in England or somewhere where there 
is a population, I think the public have an issue 
with that, and that’s a big challenge. One of the 
biggest challenges is not the technology — there 
are so many cases for that: business, 
environment and resource cases. The issue is a 
public understanding of why it’s important.
Apart from public acceptance, what 
challenges will you face in the next decade?
I think that there has been an unexpected eﬀect 
on the gathering of data. If you look at big data, 
the industry is trying to help farmers to help 
predict the weather, disease or the 
circumstances in which disease will occur and 
when to harvest, and they’re trying to use 
technology. But the unexpected side-eﬀect is the 
mushrooming, because there are loads of 
sensors, collecting information on weather, soil, 
pH, et cetera. As we are gathering mountains of 
data, we have much more data that we need to 
manipulate now. This in turn means there are 
practical problems with computers, storage, 
hard drives, things like that. I think there are 
real challenges around data farming and data 
processing, which is an unfortunate side-eﬀect 
of what we’re doing. 
Internet speeds are also a big problem, 
particularly in rural areas. UK agriculture is 
served by an old copper network that was 
designed for phone calls, not for data, so if you 
haven’t got ﬁbre optic (most UK farmers don’t) 
you’re reliant on the speed of data transport, 
which is often very poor.
And the solution to that would be?
Potentially going into the speed of 5G with 
wireless data, potentially getting a super-fast 
phone network. If you want to look at a 
fundamental, connectivity is key; the speed of 
data transfer, networks, how you get ﬁles 
between people. Improving the infrastructure 
that is required will enable an explosion in 
data-driven agriculture. What is holding 
everything back is we have got the technology, 
the sensors, cameras, drones, the ability to do all 
of this, but we can’t shift, we are in the Stone Age.
We need something a bit better. If you live in a 
town, everyone has ﬁbre optic, but agriculture 
isn’t in towns — it’s distributed and it’s away 
from the exchange on the old network systems. 
What is the tech that has changed the face of 
farming in the last ﬁve to ten years?
Some of the game-changers are auto steer and 
guidance, where the tractor just drives in 
straight lines. It drives up and down by itself, 
reducing the overlap. By eye you can end up with 
a ﬁve to seven per cent overlap, but with GPS it 
can be reduced down to 1.5 to two per cent. That 
uses less fuel and reduces the strain on the 
operator, because you don’t have to focus on that. 
There are a number of other great 
advancements, but that is one technology that 
has really enabled farmers to do a lot of things.
Sensors
Sensors can be used in a variety of
applications, and it’s now possible
for farmers to see that data as it is
being recorded in the field. How It
Works spoke to Nahuel Lavino of
Pycno Sensors, who explained their
importance to farming.
“Before sensors, farmers would
use intuition to see how the plants’
pattern and colour would change to
suggest they were stressed. Now
with sensors farmers can visualise in
real time if their crops will be in
stress or if there is a pest sprouting
before it happens. Utilising the
information about soil and air every
few minutes means a decrease in the
use of resources such as water,
electricity, pesticides and fungicides.
We can apply them when the plants
really need them instead of
depending on a set calendar.”

“Plants grown hydroponically do not

The ways in which farmers treat crops are
improving constantly, helping to preserve
soil quality and maximise efficiency
Farming methods
So how can genetic modiﬁcation help boost 
the quality of the most important crops? The 
secret lies in editing the genome of an organism 
to improve its ability to photosynthesise. Corn 
and sugarcane are successful because they use a
more eﬀicient method called C4 photosynthesis.
This discovery has inspired research projects 
around the world to start investigating the 
feasibility of producing C4 rice and C4 wheat. 
Genetic modiﬁcation can also help increase 
the yield of a crop, which means more eﬀicient 
land use. In addition, it can reduce the need for 
herbicides and other pesticides, as the produce 
itself can be modiﬁed to contain the genes 
needed to protect itself. Genetically 
modiﬁed organisms (GMOs) are 
already used around the 
world. For example, 
papayas in the US have 
been genetically 
engineered to survive 
the ringspot virus, which 
almost wiped out production of 
the fruit in the 1980s. The future 
of GMOs relies on widespread 
acceptance of their safety and 
importance so they can be further 
distributed to those in need. 
ROBOTS AND DRONES
Machines have been integrated into almost 
every aspect of our lives, changing everything 
from the way we communicate to the way we 
travel, so it makes sense that robotics have 
shaped farming. 
Agricultural robots, known as ‘agbots’, already 
play a role during the harvesting stage, and 
more recent developments have seen the 
introduction of this technology for weed control, 
seed planting and soil analysis. Some of these 
electronics are deployed to replace human 
labour, such as agbots programmed to pick fruit 
or spray crops, making the process faster. 
The mechanical design of an agbot is highly 
dependent on its purpose, and deﬁned by the 
end eﬀector. For example, end eﬀectors on a 
spraying agbot will be a spray nozzle whereas a 
robot at the end of the production line might 
have a bagging system. Drones can also play a 
role in precision farming, helping farmers to 
monitor crops by creating three-dimensional 
maps for soil analysis using ultrasonic echoing 
and lasers.  
THE FUTURE 
Engineering solutions have revolutionised 
agriculture, and with so many hi-tech tools at 
our disposal, ending world hunger may well be 
an achievable goal in the decades to come.
Farming methods
We have a booming 
population, and we are 
running out of space to 
grow crops. It’s time to 
start thinking vertically!
Conventional farming
Traditional field work involves
ploughing and harrowing to turn
up the earth to make the land
more fertile and control weed
growth, but over time the soil
becomes exhausted and unusable.

Minimal farming
Minimal farming methods
are considerably less
aggressive and use more
widely spaced furrows in
the ploughing process.
However, this can destroy
microfauna and becomes
harmful to the land over
the long term.
Precision farming
Recent decades have seen an
increase in precision farming,
improving the productivity of
farmland by using global
positioning systems (GPS).
Data analysis
Information gathered from
field sensors and GPS
trackers can help farmers
evaluate the overall health of
their crops and pinpoint any
potential problems.
Mapping
A GPS system within a
harvester can map crop
yield to indicate areas of
the crop that are
thriving or struggling, so
farmers can tailor the
amount of fertiliser and/
or water to the poorly
performing areas.
Zero farming
This technique doesn’t use any form of plough or
harrow. Instead, seeds are placed in the remains of
the previous crop, which over time forms a nourishing
bed for the new crop, preventing soil erosion and
increasing the land fertility. It doesn’t destroy
microfauna and flora, requiring a larger use of
pesticides. This can pollute groundwater and rivers,
but is required to keep weed growth under control.

017 year marked a signiﬁcant change in 
Apple’s iPhone release schedule — when 
Tim Cook took to the stage back in 
September, he actually announced two new 
models of the best-selling phone. This month, we
took a closer look at the iPhone 8, with its 
all-glass design and a whole bunch of cool new
tricks. Aside from a tweaked design, the phone
also oﬀers new sensors, an improved display, a
better camera with more ways to take great 
photos, and wireless charging that lets you 
power up without needing to plug in.
The big news for this year, though, is the 
augmented reality tech that is being included 
with the new iPhone. A platform, AR Kit, was 
made available to app developers earlier this 
year, which allows them to create augmented 
worlds that can be viewed through the screen of 
the iPhone 8 — it’s a little like Pokémon Go only 
bigger, better and easier to create. The iPhone 8 
allows this to work seamlessly, and it’s being 
used for everything from visualising furniture in 
your front room to fully interactive 3D games that 
appear on your tabletop at home.
Every year we are astonished by how much 
tech smartphones can pack into such a small 
space, so we’ve opened up the iPhone 8 to see 
how Apple ﬁts it all in. Let’s see what’s inside…
How does Apple ﬁt everything

The iPhone X
The second iPhone that was announced by Tim Cook in September 2017 was the iPhone X. This 
new model features a screen that extends right to the edge of the glass and includes Face ID, a 
new technology that scans your face to unlock the device and authenticate things like payments 
via Apple Pay. The new device doesn’t feature a Home button either — it’s the first iPhone without
one. Instead, a section at the bottom of the screen can be swiped upwards to return to the main 
Home page. That huge display is an OLED (compared to the IPS display on more recent iPhone 
models), meaning that it can display deeper blacks and more vibrant colours. Of course, it’s also 
waterproof, features wireless charging and takes incredible photos — just like the iPhone 8.
The camera in the new 
iPhone has a bigger sensor 
with larger pixels that let in 
more light for better photos
Battery
As always, the battery takes up the
majority of space inside the iPhone.
This one offers 6.96 Watt-hours of
power — less than the iPhone 7.
Wireless charging
This black cover hides a coil
of wire that will allow you to
recharge the battery by
simply placing it down on a
compatible charging mat.
Reinforced frame
The front and back of the
iPhone are both made of
glass, but the rear frame of
the phone is now reinforced
with steel and copper.
Glass back
For wireless charging to
work effectively, the back
of the iPhone can’t be
made of metal. The iPhone
8’s glass back, made using
a seven-layer colour process,
is the perfect solution.
The logic board
This is the brain of the
iPhone, containing the
bionic Apple A11 chip, as
well as the flash storage
where all your data is kept.

onitoring blood glucose levels is 
incredibly important for those 
suﬀering with diabetes. Insulin 
regulates the amount of glucose in the 
bloodstream to try and keep blood glucose levels 
as stable as possible. But the bodies of diabetics
either can’t produce insulin (type 1), or don’t
produce enough or don’t respond to it properly
(type 2). By observing blood glucose ﬂuctuations
with a glucometer, diabetics can prevent
excessively low or high blood sugar, known as
hypo/hyperglycemia (respectively), and select
the correct treatment.
In general, glucometers work using a drop of
blood, usually from a pricked ﬁnger, which is
then placed on a test strip inserted into the
device. The enzyme glucose oxidase is housed
on the strip and reacts with the glucose in the
blood sample, 
becoming gluconic 
acid. As this acid 
moves through the layers 
of the strip it reacts with potassium 
ferricyanide to form potassium ferrocyanide.
The electrode oxidises the ferrocyanide, which
in turn generates an electric current, displaying
a numerical value we understand. The more
intense the reaction, the higher the glucose level
and the greater the reading on the glucometer
screen and visa versa.
There have been a number of developments
made in glucometer technology in recent years.
For example, researchers at Harvard University
are developing a tattoo that will change colour
depending on a person’s glucose levels. Other,
non-invasive methods are also being developed.

ravel to the edge of the Solar System and 
you might be in for a bit of a surprise. 
Along the way you’ll ﬁnd two so-called 
‘ice giants’, worlds that ﬁt somewhere between 
rocky planets and gas giants in size. Their 
simplistic names, however, belie their 
fascinatingly complex environments, which 
we’re only now beginning to understand. 
Welcome to Uranus and Neptune.
Only one spacecraft has ever visited these two 
worlds: the enigmatic Voyager 2 probe in 1986 
and 1989 respectively. Making use of a rare 
planetary alignment that only happens once 
every 176 years, Voyager 2 ﬂew by the gas giants 
Jupiter and Saturn before brieﬂy visiting Uranus 
and Neptune. Despite their status as two of the 
eight major planets in our Solar System, our 
knowledge of them is limited; mainly coming 
from this brief ﬂyby, in addition to ground and 
space observations.
The distance of Uranus and Neptune from 
Earth — 2.7 billion and 4.3 billion kilometres on 
average — has made these two worlds decidedly 
diﬀicult to explore. Right now, scientists at NASA 
are planning to return to one or both of these 
worlds. Both are interesting in their own right, 
but only one is likely to be selected for study,
with a target launch date around 2030 or 2031. Of
particular interest is to send a probe into the
atmosphere of one of the planets, which we did
with the Galileo probe that visited Jupiter
back in 1995.
And there’s good reason to go back,
because both Uranus and Neptune —
over 14.5 and 17 times the mass of
Earth respectively — are still 
hiding plenty of secrets. For 
example, Uranus emits almost as
much heat as it absorbs from the
Sun, meaning it lacks a strong 
internal heat source, unlike 
the other outer planets. And 
we just don’t really know why 
it’s doing that. As for Neptune, 
its moon Triton is incredibly 
intriguing; possibly a dwarf 
planet stolen from further out 
in the Kuiper Belt. Looking at 
this moon up close could 
reveal its origins and oﬀers an 
opportunity to explore a 
Kuiper Belt Object (KBO).

The name ‘ice giants’ is a little bit of a 
misnomer – there is relatively little solid ice in
them today. These ice giants contain high levels
of heavier elements including oxygen, carbon
and nitrogen, which are the probably the next
most abundant elements in the Sun. When the
planets formed the elements were probably
gathered up in their frozen form or contained in
water ice. The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are
so named because of the large amounts of
hydrogen and helium gas in their layers, l
gathered from the disc of dust and gas that
surrounded our young Sun. 
Inside each of the two ice giants we think
there is a rocky core of iron and nickel that’s
anything from half to several times the mass of
Earth. Surrounding their cores are thought to be
icy oceans made of methane, water and 
ammonia. Even so, we’re only just starting to
understand what’s happening in these regions.
Today you’d be hard-pressed to argue that
Uranus and Neptune are icy in the traditional
sense. The temperatures inside these planets 
can reach thousands of degrees, but the pressure 
is around 100,000 times or so that on Earth. The 
result is that water and other compounds are 
squashed into a ‘superionic’ phase, where they
are neither a solid nor a liquid. Some atoms, like
oxygen, are essentially frozen, whereas others,
such as hydrogen, move at high speeds.
The results are some weird regions where a
huge ocean of water, ammonia and methane
churn. Scientists have proposed that the
pressure and temperature is so intense th
may rain diamonds inside these planets
Researchers were able to mimic this
Earth, producing diamonds a few
across. But inside Uranus and N
process can last millions of yea
bigger diamonds.
Most of their mass is made up of hot,
ﬂuid of ‘ices’ whereas Jupiter and Saturn, by
comparison, are essentially giant balls of
hydrogen and helium gas. And it seems that ice
giants must form in pretty exact circumstances 
after gas giants have swept up other material, 
and even then they must grow large enough to 
surround their rocky core with gas. Yet 
surprisingly, ice giants are one of the most 
common types of exoplanet. 
Further studies of Uranus and Neptune are 
therefore not just important for our own Solar 
System. While we are interested to know what 
makes these worlds so diﬀerent, we also want to 
know why so many other planetary systems 
have ice giants, or even planets that are a bit 
smaller (about ten times the mass of Earth), 
known as mini-Neptunes. A mission to one of 
these ice giants would produce a cavalcade of 
science. There will be plenty of people hoping 
such a mission happens soon.

This mission would be the cheapest of the
bunch mentioned here. It would swing past
the planet and into deep space, just as
Voyager 2 did in 1986. A probe would be
deployed into the atmosphere of Uranus, but
the mission as a whole would have a limited
time to observe Uranus, its ring system and
its moons. This should still be enough to tell
us what it’s made of though.
Uranus orbiter
with probe
Provisional launch date: 2031
Mission duration: 15 years
This mission combines the best of the
other two Uranus missions, placing a
probe into orbit for three years while also
sending a probe into the atmosphere. It
would have three instruments: a
narrown-angle camera, doppler imager
and magnetometer to allow study of the
planet’s composition, with the probe
getting data from inside the planet. This
would give us invaluable data on the
moons and ring system of the ice giant.

espite their name, planetary nebulae have 
nothing to do with planets. These gas 
shells are formed when smaller stars 
(those between around 0.8 to eight times the mass 
of our Sun) run out of hydrogen fuel for fusion. As 
fusion slows, the core becomes unstable and 
shrinks, becoming increasingly hot, allowing the 
fusion of helium into heavier atoms such as 
carbon and oxygen. The radiation pressure from 
this second cycle of fusion causes the star’s outer 
layers to expand, transforming it into a red giant. 
However, once the helium runs out, lower-mass 
stars are not hot enough to sustain further fusion 
of even heavier elements. The radiation pressure 
from the ﬁnal throes of helium fusion pushes the 
red giant’s outer layers away into space, 
creating cloud-like gas shells. The stellar 
core that remains at the centre of the 
cloud emits radiation, ionises the 
ejected gases, making the 
planetary nebula visible to us. 
In cosmic terms, planetary 
nebulae don’t last very long. 
After about 10,000 years, the 
remnant star cools to the 
point it no longer emits 
enough energy to ionise 
the surrounding cloud, 
rendering the nebula 
invisible to us.

The Cat’s 
Eye Nebula
Stellar core
Planetary nebulae surround the
remains of dying stars. Many of
these remnants are incredibly
hot as the former red giant’s core
continues to contract.
Ionisation
Radiation from the stellar core
transfers energy to gas molecules
in the nebula, causing them to
emit high-energy photons and
glow in various colours depending
on their constituent elements.
Concentric clouds
Distinct shells in the Cat’s Eye
Nebula are thought to have
formed as the central star
ejected its mass in a series of
pulses 1,500 years apart.
Massive shells
It is estimated that each of
the Cat’s Eye’s gas shells
contain as much mass as
all the planets in our Solar
S stem combined.
Complex formation
The Cat’s Eye Nebula was among the
first planetary nebulae discovered
by astronomers and is one of the
most complex we know of.

t is a concept that once divided the scientiﬁc 
community: do we exist in a spherical or ﬂat 
universe? Einstein’s theory of General 
Relativity suggests that space is curved by mass,
and so the universe’s density (its mass spread
over its volume) determines its shape. We also
know that the universe is expanding as a result
of the Big Bang, and scientists have calculated a
value known as the critical density — the
minimum density required to prevent the 
universe from expanding indeﬁnitely, while 
also stopping it from collapsing in on itself. 
By comparing the universe’s actual and 
critical densities, cosmologists can predict the 
shape of our universe and also its eventual fate. 
For example, if the actual density were greater 
than the critical density, the universe would 
look like a sphere. If this is the case, the universe 
is ﬁnite and will one day stop expanding and 
start to contract.
However, the concept of a ﬂat (Euclidean) 
universe is now the most widely accepted 
theory. In this case, the actual density of the 
universe is equal to its critical density, without 
causing it to curve one way or another. If this 
theory is correct, the universe will continue to 
expand forever.
Does the cosmos have a shape? And why does it matter?
The shape of the universe
There are three diff
bilities for how we could interpret the unive
Shape and fate
Euclidean
Space has zero curvature — in
other words it doesn’t curve
positively or negatively and
continues to expand forever.
Spherical
Space has a positive curvature, curving
to the point that it comes back on itself,
forming a sphere. As a closed universe,
the amount of expansion is finite.
Hyperbolic
Space has a negative curvature,
appearing as a saddle. The 
expansion of this open universe 
is infinite.

omet Shoemaker-Levy 9 
was discovered by 
astronomers Eugene and 
Carolyn Shoemaker and David 
Levy in 1993, a year before 
astronomers witnessed its 
spectacular collision with 
Jupiter. The gas giant’s  
immense gravitational pull 
forced the comet to break apart 
into 21 smaller fragments,  
before plummeting to the 
planet’s surface. 
Individual fragments of the 
comet crashed down on Jupiter 
over the course of several days, 
creating visible bruises on the 
surface and ending its 4-billion-
year journey through the Solar
System. The impressive marks
left on Jupiter were so clear that
small telescopes on Earth could
see them. 
The scars left by Shoemaker-
Levy 9 are no longer visible to u
having been erased by Jupiter’s
winds. The comet, however, did
more than just make a mark on
the surface: it caused the thin
ring surrounding Jupiter to tilt
by around two kilometres. As it
struck the surface at 60 
kilometres per second, the  
force of the impact and the  
dust expelled pushed the  
ring outward.

e live in an exciting world, one full of 
promise, innovations and 
opportunities. But we also live in a 
world that has signiﬁcant challenges, such as a 
rapidly growing population. If global population 
growth continues to increase at its present rate, 
then by 2050 there will be close to 10 billion 
people in the world. 
Feeding a burgeoning and ever-more

dramatic increase in food production, with 
estimates suggesting we will need to increase 
food production by 70 per cent. Which presents 
us with the question of how? Can we not simply 
increase the scale of what we are already doing? 
No is the simple answer. 
Resources such as land, oceans, water and 
energy are already limited, and the sheer 
quantity of land and water required by the 
global livestock industry is placing an enormous 
strain on the environment, not to mention the 
impact it’s having in terms of pollution. The

available to them, but instead due to the taste 
and the fact they have long been part of local 
food cultures; some are even seen as delicacies. 
Delicacies or not, edible insects ﬁt the mould 
from an environmental point of view. Research 
has shown that crickets are twice as eﬀicient in 
converting feed to protein as chicken, at least
four times more eﬀicient than pigs and 12 times
more eﬀicient than cattle, and what’s more, they
require signiﬁcantly less quantities of feed, and
much less water, than livestock. However, a
word of caution. On the face of it, given their
nutritional content and the reduced resources
required to rear them in comparison to meat,
insects seem a viable solution to the need to
produce more sustainable sources of protein. Yet
it’s hard to say what eﬀect the mass production of
insects would have on the environment, or if
indeed it would be sustainable in the long term.
Many of the 2 billion people who already
include insects in their diet do so having caught
them in the wild, as opposed to buying them
from the large-scale insect farms that would be
required to produce the quantities needed for
larger populations. That’s not to say it’s not
viable, only that at this stage the full extent of
such production is not yet known.
‘feedlots’ is enough to highlight the less than 
satisfactory conditions many animals are reared 
in for mass meat production.   
So what’s the solution? How can we meet these 
ever-increasing demands for protein? How can 
we feed nearly 10 billion people? One possible 
answer to that question is entomophagy — the 
eating of insects. The very thought of such an act 
is enough to ﬁll some people with a sense of 
repulsion, and yet our often common 
prejudgement towards entomophagy is not 
justiﬁed from a nutritional or environmental 
perspective. Insects are healthy, nutritious 
alternatives to mainstream staples such as 
chicken, pork, and beef. They are rich in protein,
high in good fats and boast an array of
micronutrients essential to the human body.
While an alien concept to many in the Western
world, there are around 2 billion people
worldwide for whom insects are a regular part of
their diet. In most Western countries, however,
people view entomophagy with a sense of
disgust and associate eating insects with
primitive behaviour. Such negative feelings do
little to dispel the common misconception that
people who eat insects in the developing world
do so because of starvation. Many of those who
eat insects do so not because there is little else

INGREDIENTS 
- 125g of cashew nuts
- 250g of Medjool dates
- 75g of sour Morello cherries 
- 50g of cricket flour
- 30g of raw cacoa powder
- 1 tablespoon of maple syrup 
INSTRUCTIONS 
Place the cashew nuts in a food processor and 
pulse them for 15 seconds until they are 
chopped into small pieces.  
Now add in the dates, cherries and cacao 
powder and blitz for 20 seconds. Then add in 
the cricket flour and maple syrup and blitz until 
all of the ingredients form into a ball. This may 
take a few minutes but you will notice a 
sudden change in the texture and consistency 
of the ingredients.  
Roll the ball out on greaseproof paper until you 
have a neat rectangle and then place it in the 
freezer for 20 minutes to set. Once the mixture 
has set, remove it and cut it into squares, then 
keep it in the fridge in a sealed container.

change people’s
mindsets then we
need to do so with
dishes that not on y
taste great — insects boast a wide variety of 
ﬂavours — but appeal visually as well. 
For someone not sure about eating 
grasshoppers, the last thing they want is to see 
one staring up at them from their plate. As with 
any change, it takes time, and at present the 
edible insect industry is still in its infancy, 
although it’s growing rapidly as more people 
become aware of the beneﬁts to the 
environment and also themselves. 
As the world’s population continues to swell so 
does the need to dramatically shrink 
agriculture’s environmental footprint, meaning 
that we will need to look for more ethical and 
sustainable food sources very soon. 
Entomophagy isn’t the only viable option 
available, but it is one solution, meaning insects 
have a valuable role to play in the future of our 
world and the people that live in it. And, with 
every year that passes, that role is only going to 
get bigger. Grasshopper stir-fry anybody?
And yet, while insects are commonly 
consumed as a food source in many regions of 
the world, Western societies are still largely 
averse to the practice of eating them because of 
the very fact they are insects. We have always 
seen insects as little more than pests, bugs, 
creepy crawlies, even objects of disgust — never 
as a food source. As American naturalist Joseph 
Charles Bequaert said, “What we eat is, after all, 
more a matter of custom and fashion than 
anything else. It can be attributed only to 
prejudice that civilised men of today show such a 
decided aversion to including any six-legged 
creatures in their diet.” 
Our prejudices are hardly helped by minor 
celebrities being forced to eat insects on trivial 
reality television shows, a practice that only 
serves to reinforce and exaggerate people’s 
disgust towards bugs. We need to be actively 
educating people about the beneﬁts of edible 
insects in a bid to try and change their 
perceptions and food preferences, which isn’t 
always easy but by no means impossible. 
Lobsters and shrimp were once considered to be 
a mark of poverty, but are now considered 
luxury food items, and what’s more, they belong 
to the same arthropod family as insects. So it 
begs the question, if we can change our thinking 
towards lobster, then why not insects? 
While education surrounding the nutritional 
and environmental beneﬁts of insects needs to 
play a part, there also needs to be a focus on 
creating attractive dishes that people actually 
want to eat. If we are to break down mental

t is not uncommon to see trees curve and 
bend as they grow, but some of the pine trees 
in Poland’s Krzywy Las are bizarrely 
deformed. Commonly known as the ‘Crooked 
Forest’, 400 pine trees protrude from the ground 
vertically until suddenly deciding to grow 
horizontally, creating an abrupt 90-degree bend. 
Most of the trees bend towards the north.
It has been estimated that the forest was 
planted in the 1930s in the hopes of harvesting 
the wood once they had grown. As an isolated 
portion of the woodland, various hypotheses 
have been proposed to explain the curvature of 
only some of the trees. Some have suggested that 
heavy snowfall over a lengthy duration ﬂattened 
the trees  while they were still saplings. Others 
suggest it may be the result of a genetic 
mutation, or due to sprout damage caused by 
tanks during World War Two. 
However, the dominant theory to explain 
these wooden wonders, is one of human 
manipulation rather than natural deﬁance. It is 
thought that farmers restrained and 
manipulated the way some of the pines grew in 
order to later use the wood for curved furniture 
and the construction of boat hulls. 
Manipulating trees to form desirable shapes is
something we still see today. Pleaching, for 
example, is a method that trains trees like ash or
beech to intertwine and form a curved canopy 
walkway. However, due to the German invasion 
of Poland in September 1939, farmers had to 
abandon this woodland, leaving a curious 
crooked wood behind.

trees appear to defy the laws of nature

The acid threat
Due to a higher level of carbon dioxide in the 
Earth’s atmosphere, in part caused by the 
burning of fossil fuels, a higher level of carbon 
dioxide is absorbed into the oceans. This 
lowers the water’s pH and causes the seas to 
become more acidic.
Since the Industrial Revolution, levels of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have 
increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) to 
over 400ppm. As ocean acidification 
continues, the increasingly acidic waters make 
it harder for phytoplankton to absorb nutrients, 
making them more susceptible to disease. 
Certain types of phytoplankton are particularly 
vulnerable, such as those who build their shells 
from calcium carbonate. This compound 
dissolves more readily in a more acidic ocean, 
and the primary building block of their shells  
(carbonate ions) are less available in the water. 
This has huge implications for the entire 
marine ecosystem, the production of oxygen 
for our atmosphere and eventually change the 
balance of plankton species in our waters.  
Diatoms are some of  
the largest and fastest-
multiplying types of 
phytoplankton. Some can 
reproduce up to 100,000 
times in a month!

‘Phytoplankton’ derives from the Greek ‘phyto’ (plant) and ‘planktos’ (wanderer)
DID YOU KNOW? 
P
hytoplankton are the deﬁnition of the 
phrase ‘all good things come in small 
packages’. Simply put, most of these little 
ocean drifters are microscopic, single-celled 
plant-like organisms that photosynthesise and 
can be found in both marine and freshwater and 
are present in all of the world’s oceans. They live 
in the euphotic zone (the topmost layer of 
the ocean) where sunlight is
plentiful. There are so many
that if you scooped up a
Coke can of seawater
you’d probably have
bagged yourself as
many as 75–100
million individual
phytoplankton.
Accompanying
the phytoplankton
in this heady mix of
ocean soup are the
zooplankton, which
are tiny animals — some
are the larval stages of
much bigger creatures, others
will remain as just tiny beasts. All
plankton are unable to swim against the
ocean currents and so they ﬂoat at the mercy of
the waves. However, there are areas where more
phytoplankton occur, usually where upwelling
(deep, cold water rises up to the surface) brings 
essential nutrient-rich water to the surface. 
Phytoplankton are crucial for life on Earth 
— it’s almost unimaginable to think of a world 
without them. The tiny organisms form the basis 
of the entire oceanic food web, 
photosynthesising to turn sunlight into energy 
and providing food for small ﬁlter-feeders 
and grazers, which in turn are food
for larger animals, including
the ﬁsh on our own plates.
The phytoplankton
also have a huge
impact on our
atmosphere as they
are responsible for
producing at least 50
per cent of Earth’s
oxygen. They are
also an important
carbon sink, taking in
carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere that is
then pulled to the bottom
of the ocean when the
phytoplankton dies. Over millions
of years these plankton (along with other
marine creatures and organic matter) build up
in layers on the seabed, which, under intense
pressure and heat, can form oil or natural gas.
Forget whales, sharks and the giant squid: it’s the 
smallest living organisms in the briny blue that 
keep life on our planet working as it should

Tracking 
the blooms
When ocean conditions are right, the plankton 
population can boom very quickly. In just a few 
days (or sometimes even hours) a stretch of 
clear blue ocean can be transformed into a 
soupy green liquid — this happens to such an 
extent that great swathes of plankton blooms 
are easily visible from space. 
This ability to watch the plankton from afar 
has allowed scientists to build up a 
comprehensive study of plankton blooms over 
many years, which in turn can be used as an 
indicator of global climate changes. Satellite 
imagery shows where the blooms are 
occurring, along with the size, rate and density 
of the bloom. They can also identify the type of 
plankton and even track the development of 
harmful algal blooms. While most 
phytoplankton blooms are non-toxic, there are 
some species that can cause harmful or toxic 
effects in marine animals and humans. 
Blooming in the lakes, seas and oceans, plankton
can clearly show the whirls and tracks of currents
There are around 5,000 types of phytoplankton. Here are five of the most common ones

Some dinoflagellates are 
bioluminescent while others 
produce toxic ‘red tides’ that are 
lethal to marine life. They have 
‘flagella’, tiny whip-like 
structures that allow for 
movement in the water.

It has been estimated that 400–700 million tons of dust is transported from the Sahara every year

S
aharan dust is a mixture of dust and sand 
from the Sahara Desert. When very 
strong winds pass over the desert, this 
mixture blows up into the sky to form clouds, 
which can reach astonishingly high altitudes. 
Winds in the upper part of the atmosphere then 
transport these dust clouds, also known as the 
Saharan Air Layer, towards the UK. 
The particles are capable of travelling 
thousands of kilometres on these dust-laden 
winds, crossing land and entire oceans where 
they even become visible on other continents. 
But you need something to wash it out of the sky.
As rain falls from the atmosphere it collects the 
dust particles on the way down. When the 
raindrops land on a surface they evaporate, 
leaving behind a layer of dust. Not only does this
dust layer result in hazy skies, but sometimes it 
also causes shorter-wavelength ‘blue’ light to be
scattered away, leaving behind longer-
wavelength ‘red’ light to shine through. This 
gives the appearance of orange-red skies.

T
he most obvious distinction between 
tortoises and turtles is where they live: 
tortoises are land dwellers, whereas most 
turtles reside in or around water. While both are 
reptiles from the order of Testudines, they are in 
diﬀerent classiﬁcation families and therefore 
have diﬀering features.
Although both have bodies protected by a 
shell, a turtle’s shell is lighter and ﬂatter to 
prevent it from sinking and more streamlined to 
help it swim, while a tortoise’s shell is larger 
and heavier and shaped like a dome to protect 
it from predators. Turtles also have webbed 
feet to aid swimming, while tortoises possess 
stubby feet for walking across various terrains. 
Their habitats inevitably mean their diets 
diﬀer too. Tortoises tend to be herbivores, 
whereas turtles are omnivores, feasting on 
vegetation as well as small ﬁsh and insects. 
However, a key similarity is that both species lay 
their eggs on land. A female turtle will leave the 
safety of the water to lay her eggs before quickly 
returning to the sea: her hatchlings have to 
make the dangerous journey to the sea alone. 
Tortoise hatchlings, however, stay with their 
mother for about 80 days.
The lifespan of a common turtle is around 
20–40 years, but green sea turtles can live for 
around 80 years or more. A tortoise’s lifespan is 
longer, averaging 80–150 years.
They certainly look alike, but just how 
similar are these creatures?

Q How fast an electric car
charges depends on several
factors, including the size of
the battery and how you
charge it. Cars can be
plugged into a charger at
home, but the lower-power
electricity supply means it
can take six to eight hours to
fully charge. More powerful
roadside charging points can
fully charge many cars in
just three to four hours, but
the very fastest can provide
an 80 per cent charge in just
half an hour. TL

electric car charge?
Why are koalas known as 
‘koala bears’? Nadine Ali
Koalas are marsupials, not bears, but they 
seem to have been given the name due to their 
big ears, rounded nose and cuddly body — 
similar to the classic teddy bear. KS
What is ‘biodynamic’ 
farming? Delia Cross
It’s a farming method based on the work of Dr 
Rudolf Steiner that emphasises the role of the

Who decides the collective 
nouns for things? Tina Sanchez
There isn’t an academy or governing body that 
decides these nouns. Like all new terms or 
phrases, they simply become more popular 
over time. Although a ‘parliament of owls’ and 
a ‘murder of crows’ still sound peculiar, a ‘pride 
of lions’ and a ‘school of fish’ have steadily 
become everyday language. KS
What was the Illuminati?
Dennis Warner
It was an 18th-century secret society set up by 
Bavarian professor Adam Weishaupt. He
opposed the Roman Catholic Church and
wanted to create a free and equal society
based on reason rather than religion. They 
disappeared after a Bavarian government ban 
in 1785 but reappeared in conspiracy theories 
in the 1960s. LM

Q  Our planet’s atmosphere and magnetic 
ﬁeld protect us from cosmic rays — high-
energy particles hurtling through space. 
Before even reaching Earth, some of the 
charged particles are deﬂected by the 
planet’s magnetic ﬁeld. Upon entering the 
atmosphere, the remaining particles 
collide with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, 
producing showers of lower-energy 
secondary particles that rain down on 
the Earth but are mostly harmless. Very

Q Humans evolved from apes, so our earliest human-like
ancestors, known as hominins, were ape-like in appearance.
Around 3 million years ago, it is thought that these early
hominins would have been covered in fur, but between 2–3
million years ago they started to inhabit open savannahs
where they were exposed to the glare of the Sun. They also
started to hunt large animals, which required running over
long distances. A hairy coat would have kept the hominins
too warm for this new lifestyle, so it is thought that they
gradually evolved to have less hair in order to keep cool. KS

Ryan Forger
Q Gargoyles are ancient drainage systems designed
to funnel water away from buildings. They are often
carved in the shape of a human, animal, or mythical
creature with a channel cut throughthe throat. When
it rains, water spills out of the gargoyle’s mouth,
preventing damage to the stone walls. They became
more popular during the Gothic period, but not all
examples are true gargoyles. Decorative statues

Q  A soft mattress can cause back pain by allowing you to 
sink into a unnatural position, resulting in bad posture 
during sleep, which may cause pain later on. However, an 
extremely hard mattress can also leave you aching, as it 
will place too much pressure on the muscles in your back. 
The ideal mattress is ﬁrm rather than hard, so that your

Q  Due for completion in 2024, the 
Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will 
be the largest optical and near-

major use will be to search for distant 
planets. Stars with planets orbiting 
them ‘wobble’, and by indirectly 
measuring how distant stars wobble 
the ELT will be able to discover new 
planets around them, possibly 
allowing astronomers to understand 
how new planets form. The ELT will 
also be used to help us understand 
how galaxies evolve, study black 
holes, probe the nature of the elusive 
dark matter and dark energy and 
perhaps even measure the continued 
expansion of the universe. TL

incredible beauty, astonishing locations 
that will leave you speechless, and views that 
once seen, can never be unseen. Some people 
are lucky enough to explore the world and see 
these captivating places, but for those of us that 
can’t, this book will help to ﬁll in the gaps.
While there are oﬀicially just seven Wonders

glaciers that cascade down from Mount Blanc to 
magniﬁcent rock formations in the middle of an 
Australian desert, these pages prove that there 
are wonderful sights all around us.
Divided into chapters that focus on continents 
(and two separate chapters for the oceans and 
extreme weather) this book covers the entire 
globe. These chapters are sub-divided into 
smaller sections, such as Rivers & Lakes and 
Tundras, which each contain a selection of 
examples from every continent. What’s so 
brilliant about this layout is that even within the 
same continent all of the entries are so diﬀerent, 
oﬀering a new perspective on a country or 
landmass that you perhaps thought you already

younger generation to apply their

with Build It!, which contains 25 
practical exercises for children to 
tackle and in the process develop 
their skills in science and tech.
Containing detailed yet 
accessible guides to making items 
like clocks, catapults, periscopes, 
and traﬀic lights from such 
everyday objects as beads, elastic 
bands and cardboard, everything 
is made simultaneously crystal 
clear and educationally focused, 
with the instructions 
accompanied by detailed 
illustrations and noteworthy facts.
Depending on the age of the 
reader, some projects will 
inevitably require adult 
supervision, and some of the 
building materials will 
undoubtedly need to be obtained 
beforehand, but ultimately that 
doesn’t really matter. All in all, 
this is a great little guide to 
encourage budding scientists.

hether we’re posting photos of our
cats, scrolling through our newsfeed
or reaching out to professional
contacts, social media has become an integral
part of our lives. Humans are deeply social
creatures with a fundamental desire to connect,
and the digital age has reshaped our culture and
the way we communicate, enriching our lives in
many ways. But are there unseen dangers in this
new digital world that we haven’t educated
ourselves about?
Guy Harrison seeks to delve into the digital
realm to explore the controversy around
technology platforms that exploit our brains to
manipulate how we spend our time online. His
book highlights the critical thinking skills
needed to navigate social media through a series
of studies, discussions and observations,
providing information about how social media
exploits our brains, which are hard-wired to
respond to reward mechanisms, and gives
practical advice such as how to cut down on
social media and how to utilise technologies to
make us more aware of our online habits.
The reader is challenged to consider how
social media notiﬁcations work in a similar way
to slot machines to draw us in — sometimes we
receive a lot of likes, sometimes we receive
nothing, and Harrison describes the
intermittent variable reward system that keeps
us posting.
Throughout the book the reader is invited to
start considering how to use social media in a
smarter and more self-enriching way, which
includes methods to break out of your own bias
bubble, information on data law and a look at
social media addiction. While Harrison raises
concerns about the dangers of social media and
internet use, he also raises some positive and
thought-provoking points.
He points out that privacy has been an alien
concept to our species for most of human history.

understand how our brains work and how social

lives away from handheld technology.
Small bands of hunter-gatherers would have 
lived in such close quarters that there would 
have been little room for privacy. It’s only in the 
last two centuries that privacy has become 
desirable, and it’s likely that generations of the 
future will look back at privacy as a fanciful relic 
of the past.

Daniel Everett has uprooted the
commonly accepted foundations
of language theory and
challenged the leading
explanations for the development
of language. His engaging and
extensive investigation into early
language pushes a culturally
driven motive for its development
into the spotlight for the ﬁrst time.
Rejecting the theories that
language was a genetic ‘on’ switch
or a result of a random
evolutionary mutation, Everett
puts forward an alternative
approach to the subject that fossil
hunters and linguists have
speculated upon across decades.
His carefully formulated theory
suggests that Homo erectus was
the ﬁrst to construct words based
on symbols that had been
developed within the culture,
which were further built on by
early humans to include gesture
and intonation for more precise
communication.
He describes how language
gradually progressed over 60,000
generations, methodically
breaking down each part of the
biology required to speak, from
how we mastered using our
tongue to how the larynx
functions, before explaining the
intricacies of how we further
reﬁned language to include
grammar and our helpful ability
to tell stories.

How

A sweeping history of the 
origins of humanity’s 
greatest invention
More often than not, we humans
separate ourselves from other
species, ignoring the fact that
are related to them. But what do
mean to be a mammal, and do we
have more in common with an
aardvark than an alligator? In his
new book, Dr Liam Drew answers
these very questions and
encourages us to celebrate our
inner mammalian-ness.
From the evolution of senses to
the mammalian production of milk,
Drew calls upon Darwinian
principles in order to paint the
picture of what makes us a
mammal. As a former
neurobiologist and with a PhD in
sensory biology, Drew provides an
analytical yet conversational
approach to a range of topics,
making I, Mammal both an
entertaining and informative read.
Suitable for older readers, there are
plenty of humorous anecdotes from

Not only comparing the features 
of present-day mammals, Drew 
also explores our prehistoric 
cousins that brought fur to the 
forefront, such as the 255-million-
year-old Therapsids. We also 
discover why mammals’ brains are 
so advanced, the beneﬁts of being 
warm-blooded and how evolution 
shaped our senses. Drew also uses 
evolutionary peculiarities, such as 
the platypus, as case studies. 
Overall, I, Mammal is an excellent 
combination of scientiﬁc principle 
and comedic wit that will appeal to 
biology fans and non-scientists 
alike. An excellent read.

094  |  How It Works
1 
Make it bright 
 First take a clear plastic bottle. You can use a 
small bottle or a large two-litre bottle, any size 
works, but large bottles will require more 
materials! Fill the bottle around one-third of the 
way with water, and then add some food 
colouring; around ten drops should do for smaller 
bottles. You can use whichever colour you want, 
but orange and blue work well.
4
Light it up 
 As these bubbles rise they will pull some of 
the coloured water up with them, making streaks 
of colour burst through the oil. Put the lid tightly 
onto the bottle (otherwise it might bubble out of 
the top) and tip the bottle over a couple of times to 
make the blobs move even more. If you put a 
bright ﬂashlight underneath the bottle, it will 
light up like a real lava lamp!
2 
Add some oil 
 Fill the rest of the bottle almost to the top 
with vegetable oil. You’ll notice the water and oil 
don’t mix; the oil sits on top of the water because it 
is less dense. They don’t mix because water 
molecules are attracted to each other and the oil 
molecules are attracted to other oil molecules, so 
they will not combine and you should be able to 
see a clear line of separation between the two.
5
Add more stuff 
 When the bubbles stop appearing, open the 
lid again and drop in another broken up tablet to 
start the process all over again. You can also try 
dropping some raspberries or other small and 
light fruits into the bottle — they’ll ﬂoat between 
the layers of water and oil. When you add the 
tablet into the bottle how does the fruit react to 
the bubbles?
3
Make it bubbl
 Now drop a ﬁzzy vitamin tablet or an 
Alka-Seltzer tablet into the bottle to start the 
ﬁzzing. This will work better if you break the 
tablet into smaller pieces ﬁrst. The tablet is made 
from a mixture of chemicals that react with each 
other in the presence of water to form carbon 
dioxide gas. These bubbles are lighter than the 
liquids,sotheyrisetothetopofthebottle.

for any adverse effects experienced after carrying out these projects. 
Always take care when handling potentially hazardous equipment or when 
working with electronics and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
In summary…
The ﬁzzing tablets create carbon dioxide 
gas in the water, and these bubbles carry 
some of the coloured water with them as 
they rise. When they reach the top of the 
oil, the bubble burst, allowing the gas to 
escape and the water sinks through the oil. 
This creates streaks and balls of coloured 
liquid in the oil, just like a lava lamp!
“If you put a  
flashlight under 
the bottle, it will 
light up like a real 
lava lamp!”

How It Works  |  095
1 
Turn and spin 
 The ﬁrst thing you need to do is turn your bike 
over — rest it on the seat and straighten the 
handlebars to make sure it doesn’t fall over. Make 
sure  ask an adult to help you if you need a hand. 
You need to spin the tyre in order to start making 
music. The easiest way to do this is to turn the 
pedals as if you were riding the bike. This will 
cause the back wheel to spin round really fast.
2
Make music 
 Take a plastic ruler and press it against the 
side of the spinning bike tyre. You should hear a 
humming noise. The sound is created as the ruler 
hits the bumps in the tread of the tyre and the air 
between the tyre and the ruler is squeezed out. 
It’s the same eﬀect as when you clap your hands, 
only with the spinning tyre it happens over and 
over, creating a humming noise that goes on for as 
longastherulerisheldtothetyre.
3
Speed it up 
 Turn the pedals faster to speed up the tyre, 
then hold the ruler there again. You’ll ﬁnd that the 
note that is played is higher than when the tyre 
spins slower. This is because the impacts come 
more quickly on the tyre, so the vibrations are 
closer together and the sounds reach your ears as 
a higher note. Try pressing the ruler onto diﬀerent 
parts of the tread too — does the tyre create a 
diﬀerentnotedependingonwhereyoutouchit?
In summary…
As the ruler impacts on the tyre it creates vibrations that form sound waves. The quicker the 
vibrations occur, the higher the note that you hear. This is how musical instruments work too 
— guitar strings vibrate at diﬀerent frequencies to create diﬀerent notes.

Dolphin naps
Q Hi HIW,
If dolphins are mammals and can’t breathe
underwater, how do they sleep? Also, why
do we get bags under our eyes when we
are tired? Thank you
Oscar, aged 12
Hi Oscar! You’re right that dolphins
can’t breathe underwater. When
they rest, half of a dolphin’s brain is
actually ‘awake’ and the other side is
asleep (unihemispheric sleep). This
allows them to stay alert enough to
surface when they need to breathe,
and also to scan their environment
for any dangers.
As for why we have bags under
our eyes, this is usually because a
lack of sleep often causes the blood
vessels in the more delicate skin
under your eyes to dilate (expand).
Shivering
Q Dear How It Works,
I have to say I absolutely love reading your
magazine each month! It has so much
information packed into each issue that it
always makes my day when I get it
through the mail. With the weather getting
increasingly colder, I was wondering what
happens when we shiver? And do any
other animals shiver too? I am looking
forward to your reply and the next issue!
Thank you!
Christopher Egan, 14
Hi Christopher. As you probably
already know, our bodies need to
keep warm in order for us to stay
alive; we need to maintain a core
temperature of about 37 degrees
Celsius. When we get cold, sensors
in our skin signal our brain to start
some ‘warming up’ tactics. Shivering
is one of these instinctive responses.
When you shiver the muscles in
your body contract and expand in
quick bursts that produce heat by
expending energy, hopefully helping
to warm up our core temperature
again. And yes, nearly all mammals
and birds shiver, as do some snakes
and insects.
Lots of animals can handle the
cold much better than we can
(mostly because they have fur), such
as the Arctic fox, which will only
start shivering once the temperature
hits -70 degrees Celsius! Thank you
for writing to us and make sure you
keep warm this winter.
WIN!

This month we asked you...
It is thought that 
stress and caffeine 
can make hypnic 
jerks more frequent
QDear HIW, 
Why is it that when I go to bed, when I 
shut my eyes and I am about to go to 
sleep, sometimes I get the sudden feeling 
that I am falling or lurching into the air and
then I immediately wake up? I’ve heard 
that it happens to other people too. I hope 
that you can answer it for me and keep on
making quality magazines!

Hi Oliver, thanks for such a fantastic
question. You’re describing 
something known as a hypnic jerk. 
This is a term for when your body 
involuntarily spasms before sleep. 
It feels really weird, but it actually 
happens to almost 70 per cent of us.
Scientists are not exactly sure 
why humans do this, but it is thought
that it could be an ancient reflex. 
Before some hominin species started 
sleeping on the ground around 1.8 
million years ago, our ancestors 
slept up in trees. In response to our 
muscles relaxing while we drift off, 
our brains could be trying to stop us 
from falling out of a tree. 
Researchers have found that the 
jerks often occur at the same time 
as the start of symptoms like a fast 
heartbeat, quick breathing and 
sweating, and they can be made 
worse when you are stressed, not 
sleeping properly or have taken a 
stimulant like coffee.
Shivering is an 
important 
evolutionary 
mechanism to keep 
us warm by 
involuntarily 
contracting our 
muscles
Dolphins can sleep and swim at the same 
time for around eight hours per day
