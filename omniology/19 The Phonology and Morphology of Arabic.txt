The Orient has, for centuries, had its own magnetism for the orientalist. The names 
of Freya Stark, Lawrence of Arabia, Wilfred Thesiger, and Richard Burton conjure 
maze of bustling souks. Theirs was travel in its essence, travail in its true, original 
sense, and the images they record are every bit as colourful as the images they 
saw. But there is a diﬀ erent type of travel in these lands. Travel through the words 
and sounds of the people of the Orient. A journey which takes the traveller into 
the upper rooms of ancient houses and into the deep, dusty backstreets of ageless 
markets. A journey of listening, and recording, sounds and words and utterances, 
secrets and memories and hopes. A journey which conjures up, far more brilliantly 
than a swift race through the pyramids and past the ancient Marib dam, the real 
living jewels of the Orient. A journey which reminds the traveller that the Orient 
is its people and their story; and a journey which reminds the Arabist that beside 
the written language and the learned works of those who went before us there is 
another Arabic. A living language with traces of the past and hints of the future; and 
a language which humbles and shows us that things may not be as we thought they 
were.
This book has emerged from such journeys, from several trips to Egypt during 
the 1980s, and from many more to Yemen over the past sixteen years. This is a 
record of the sound and word structure of Cairene and San’ani Arabic at the advent 
of the twenty-ﬁ rst century. Both dialects are changing all the time, and San’ani, 
now bravely fortiﬁ ed behind restored ramparts of clay and time-honoured trad-
itions, may yet succumb to the forces of change, and may eventually die. It is to the 
speakers of these dialects, and particularly to the women of the old city of San’a, 
that I dedicate this book.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter I sketch the development of Arabic from its Proto-Semitic ancestor 
to the present-day dialects. I begin by looking at common features of Semitic phon-
ology, morphology, and syntax. I then consider the position of Arabic within the 
Semitic phylum as a Central Semitic language which also exhibits several shared 
traits with South Semitic. In Sections 1.2.1–3, I consider the spread of Arabic from 
the Arabian Peninsula, the development of the standard language and the phenom-
enon of diglossia. In Section 1.3 I introduce the main focus of this work, the mod-
ern dialects of Cairene and San’ani Arabic.
1.1 THE SEMITIC LANGUAGE FAMILY
Arabic is a member of the Semitic language family, which itself is part of the 
wider Afroasiatic phylum including Ancient Egyptian, Coptic, Cushitic,1 Berber, 
and Chadic. Other principal members of the Semitic family are the East Semitic 
languages of Akkadian and Eblaite (both now long dead), and the West Semitic lan-
guages Aramaic, Ugaritic, the Canaanite languages (including Hebrew), ancient 
and modern South Arabian, and the Semitic languages of Ethiopia (for example, 
Ge’ez, Tigre, Tigrinya, and Amharic) (Hetzron 1992: 412–13;2 Faber 1997: 6; cf. 
Beeston 1970: 11). Common features of Semitic in terms of the phonology, morph-
ology, and syntax are set out in the following sections.
1.1.1 Phonology
Semitic languages are marked by a limited vocalic system and a rich consonantal 
system. There are typically three basic vowels a, i, u, which are attested in both 
their short and long forms. Semitic languages are also marked by a rich inven-
tory of guttural consonants, which includes both the laryngeals ʔ, h, the pharyn-
geals c,  and the uvular fricatives χ and ʁ. The consonantal phonemes of Semitic 
languages usually constitute triads of voiceless, voiced and ‘emphatic’ in certain 
1 Hetzron (1992: 413) includes Omotic and Beja (‘if the latter two are separate branches’). Accord-
ing to Zaborski (p.c.), Beja is a Cushitic language and not an independent branch of Afroasiatic.
2 Hetzron divides Arabic into the following fourteen dialect groups: Balkh, Classical, Cypriot, East-
ern Colloquial, Egyptian, Hassaniya, Judeo-Moroccan, Judeo-Tunisian, Modern Standard, Moroccan, 
Northeastern Colloquial, Shua, Sudanese and Western Colloquial (Hetzron 1992: 416).

sub-sets of the coronal set, and in a few languages, including dialects of Arabic 
spoken in parts of south-west Yemen, in the dorsal set. ‘Emphatic’ sounds today 
are pharyngealized in the Central Semitic languages of Arabic and Neo-Aramaic, 
and glottalized in the South Semitic languages of Modern South Arabian and 
Ethiopian Semitic (Faber 1997: 8). Descriptions of eighth-century CE Classical 
Arabic suggest a velarized articulation for the emphatics in this dialect. A glot-
talized articulation of the emphatics is generally reconstructed for Proto-Semitic 
(Martinet 1959: 93; Dolgopolsky 1977; Hetzron 1992: 413; Faber 1997: 8). Com-
mon or Proto-Semitic appears to have had voiceless, voiced, and emphatic triads 
in four sub-sets of the coronal set (including a lateral sub-set) and in the dorsal set 
(Lipinski 1997: 107). The Proto-Semitic voiceless, voiced and emphatic triads are 
represented in Figure 1.1.
Within the lateral set, the voiceless lateral, *, and the emphatic lateral, *, were 
both realized as lateral fricatives, while the voiced lateral appears to have had a 
similar articulation to the plain lateral l attested in Semitic languages today. The 
Proto-Semitic emphatic lateral fricative, *, is the ancestor of the Classical Arabic 
phoneme known as ƒd (Rabin 1951; Moscati et al. 1964; Fischer 1997: 189). 
Descriptions by the Arab grammarians show unambiguously that ƒd continued to 
be articulated as an emphatic lateral fricative well into the eighth century CE (Rabin 
1951: 33; Steiner 1977: 57 ﬀ .). Rabin also claims that ƒd was articulated laterally 
by some twentieth-century Qur’anic readers (Rabin 1951: 33). ƒd continues to 
The voiceless lateral, *, is classiﬁ ed as one of the three sibilants of Proto-
Semitic. It is referred to as *s 2 in descriptions of ancient South Arabian languages 
(Moscati et al. 1964: 33) and there is considerable morphological evidence to show 
that it is the ancestor of Classical Arabic š¤n (Moscati et al. 1964: 34; Lipinski 
1997: 124, 131; Rabin 1951: 209, note 7; cf. Fischer 1997: 189), with the original 
palatoalveolar sibilant of Proto-Semitic (*š or *s1) apparently having coalesced 
historically with *s 3 to become, over the course of time, the dental sibilant, s 
(Lipinski 1997: 124). The reﬂ ex of *s 2 in modern South Arabian languages is a 
lateral fricative (Kogan and Korotayev 1997: 222; Simeone-Senelle 1997: 381–2). 
By the eighth century CE, the phoneme known as š¤n had lost its laterality in Arabic,

or at least in Classical Arabic3 and, from what we can infer from the writings 
of the eighth-century ce Arab grammarian, Sibawayh, was articulated as a voice-
less palatal fricative, with an articulation similar to German /ç/ (Watson 1992: 74; 
Lipinski 1997: 124, 130). The phoneme j¤m, which probably had an original velar 
articulation in Proto-Semitic, moved forward and, according to Sibawayh, was pro-
duced between the middle of the tongue and the middle of the hard palate in eighth-
century CE Classical Arabic (Sibawayh 1982: 433). This description is interpreted 
either as a voiced palatal occlusive (Gairdner 1925: 23; Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 
105; Watson 1992: 73) or as a voiced palatalized velar occlusive (Schaade 1911: 
73; Rabin 1951: 31, 126; Cantineau 1960: 58); I conjecture that Arabic š¤n and j¤m 
at this time constituted a voiceless–voiced palatal near pair, *ç–*.
As a result of changes in the articulation of the non-emphatic lateral fricative, *, 
and the voiced velar stop, *g, the eighth-century ce Arabic described by Sibawayh 
exhibited the three voiceless, voiced, emphatic triads in the coronal set shown in 
Figure 1.2 (cf. Rabin 1951: 209, n. 7).
1.1.2 Morphology
One of the main distinguishing features of Semitic languages is their root-and-
pattern morphology. The root is a semantic abstraction consisting of two, three, 
or (less commonly) four consonants from which words are derived through the 
superimposition of templatic patterns (Holes 1995: 81). In Arabic, the root √KTB 
has the broad lexical sense of ‘writing’ from which the words for ‘book’ (KiTaaB), 
‘written’ (MaKTuuB), ‘writer’ (KaaTiB), ‘oﬃ  ce’ (maKTaB) and ‘document’ (KaTi-
iBa) are derived. Nouns have feminine and masculine gender, and singular and 
plural number, and also dual in some Semitic languages. Adjectives are mor-
phologically like nouns. Predicative adjectives agree with the noun subject in

3 There is evidence that pre-Classical Arabic and other dialects of early Arabic had a lateral frica-
tive. These include some second-century BCE to third-century CE inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw, near 
modern Sulayyil, which ‘are written in ﬁ ne monumental South Arabian script, capable of expressing the 
phonetic features of Arabic unambiguously’ and which ‘attest the preservation of š (s1) and s (s 2)’ (Lipin-
ski 1997: 73–4). Steiner considers the pair of doublets, qišda and qilda, in Lisƒn al-cArab, evidence ‘that 
at an earlier period (or in a diﬀ erent dialect) Arabic š¤n was a fricative-lateral’ (Steiner 1977: 95).

gender and number.4 Attributive adjectives agree with the attributed noun in gen-
der, number, case, and deﬁ niteness. Semitic languages typically have three sets 
of pronominal forms: independent subject pronouns, and bound possessive and 
two conjugations for the subject: preﬁ xes and suﬃ  xes for the non-past tense 
(also described as the imperfect aspect), and suﬃ  xes only for the past tense (also 
described as the perfect aspect). The Semitic subject markers are laid out in 
Table 1.1 (from Hetzron 1992: 414).
In Central Semitic (including most dialects of Arabic), -k of the ﬁ rst person sin-
gular suﬃ  x was replaced by -t, while -t of the second person suﬃ  xes was replaced 
by -k in South Semitic (Faber 1997: 11).
Three other typical morphological Semitic features which are found in Stand-
ard Arabic today are the following endings on nouns and verbs (from Holes 1995: 
41):
(1) (a) A set of ﬁ nal short vowel endings suﬃ  xed to the noun to indicate case;
 
(b) A set of ﬁ nal short vowel endings suﬃ  xed to the verb to indicate mood;
 
(c)  A ﬁ nal nasal ending -n, (tanw¤n), suﬃ  xed to the noun to indicate inde-
ﬁ niteness.
These endings have all but disappeared in modern Arabic dialects, though some 
dialects spoken in the Arabian peninsula, including dialects of the Yemeni Tihama 
and dialects spoken around Abha in Saudi Arabia, preserve a vestige of tanw¤n 
(Greenman 1979; Behnstedt 1985: 60; Al-Azraqi 1998: 71–6).
1.1.3 Syntax
Although in Ethiopian Semitic the unmarked word order is S(ubject) O(bject) 
V(erb) (for example, Tigre; Raz 1997: 455), the original typical5 word order 
in Semitic languages was V(erb) S(ubject) O(bject). For modern Arabic, as in

Hebrew, it has been argued that the VSO word order is changing towards SVO 
(Loprieno 1995: 3, for instance); however, in San’ani and certain other, particu-
larly bedouin, dialects of the Peninsula, word order is often dependent on factors 
such as the dynamism of the verb (dynamic verbs are more likely to occur before 
a noun subject than stative verbs), the text type (narratives with distinct events are 
more likely to have verb-initial clauses), and stylistics (Holes 1995: 210–11; Dahl-
gren 1998; Watson 2000: 11–15). Within phrases, a word which functions as the 
qualiﬁ er typically follows the qualiﬁ ed term. Thus, an adjective follows the noun 
it qualiﬁ es, as in the Standard Arabic noun phrase:

‘the large house’
and an object or complement follows the verb it complements, as in the Standard 
Arabic verb phrase, as in (3) and (4).

1.2 ARABIC WITHIN CENTRAL SEMITIC
Within the Semitic language family, it has traditionally been claimed that Arabic 
belongs to the South-Semitic or South-West Semitic branch as a sibling of Modern 
South Arabian and Ethiopian Semitic on the basis of three common factors:
(5) (a)  Almost total preservation of the proto-Semitic sound system with the 
exception that *p lenited to f, and *š merged with *s 3 (Arabic š¤n = proto-
Semitic *s2);
 
(b) the derived fƒcala and istaf  cala patterns in the verb;
 
(c)  the formation of the plural of nouns by internal vowel changes, as in the 
following examples from Arabic:6
(6)

‘school/schools’
 
maktab-un 
makƒtib-u 
‘oﬃ  ce/oﬃ  ces’
 
miftƒ-un 
mafƒt¤-u 
‘key/keys’
6 More recent research, however, has argued that the derived fƒcala form and the internal plurals 
go back to Proto-Afroasiatic, and therefore cannot be a feature of South-West Semitic only (Zaborski 
1994, 1997).

introduction

On the basis of shared morphological innovations, however, Hetzron (1972, 1992) 
to group Arabic as a sibling of North-West Semitic (including Hebrew, Ugaritic, 
Deir Alla and Aramaic) within a Central Semitic branch. Faber lists the following 
features which are peculiar to Central Semitic (Faber 1997: 8–9):
(7) (a)  The realization of the emphatics as pharyngealized rather than glottal-
ized;
 
(b)  generalization of -t in the suﬃ  x conjugation verb to give katabtu ‘I wrote’ 
and katabta ‘you m.s. wrote’ (cf. 1.1.2);
 
(c)  a non-geminate preﬁ x conjugation yaqtul for the non-past which replaced 
the inherited *yaqattal non-past;
 
(d)  development of a compound negative marker *bal;
 
(e)  within-paradigm generalization of vowels in the preﬁ x conjugation: in 
Akkadian, the four preﬁ xes which occur in active, non-derived preﬁ x 
conjugation verbs are ʔa-, ta-, ni- and yi-, and Hetzron (1973) suggests 
that this *a–i alternation reﬂ ects the Proto-Semitic state of aﬀ airs. In 
Central Semitic, however, all preﬁ xes for a verb stem have the same 
 vowel—either a or i—depending on the voice of the verb and, in Hebrew, 
the phonological shape of the verb stem.
Other features traditionally agreed to be shared by Arabic with North-West Semitic 
include the formation of the masculine plural suﬃ  x -¤n, the internal passive, a 
deﬁ nite article which developed out of the same demonstrative element before lan-
guage separation, and the pucayl diminutive (Versteegh 1997: 17).
1.2.1 The spread of Arabic
The original homeland of speakers of Arabic is the central and northern regions of 
the Arabian Peninsula. The lower half of the Arabian Peninsula was inhabited by 
speakers of languages known as Epigraphic South Arabian (Hetzron 1992: 412). 
The end of the sixth century ce, however, saw the rise of the new religion of Islam 
promoted by the Prophet Muhammad within the Arabian Peninsula in what is now 
Saudi Arabia. The new Islamic state spread rapidly throughout the Peninsula, and 
within 100 years had extended north into the Levant, east into Iraq and Khuzistan, 
and west into North Africa. Over the centuries, the religious frontiers of Islam 
stretched into Spain, Africa, India, and Indonesia, and across central Asia into Tur-
kestan and China (Gibb 1978: 10). The rise and expansion of Islam was not only a 
religious and hence cultural conquest, but also a linguistic conquest, and within a 
few hundred years Arabic became both the oﬃ  cial and the vernacular language of 
all Islamicized countries in the Middle East. Indeed, due to the prevailing tolerance 
on the part of the Muslims to Christians and Jews, arabicization was more complete 
a process and progressed at a greater rate than islamicization (Versteegh 1997: 93).
In the course of the spread of Islam, Arabic found itself in contact with a series 
of foreign languages which it has tended to supplant. In Egypt during the early 
and others (Faber 1997, for instance) have proposed that it is more plausible

centuries of Islamic domination, the Coptic patriarchs communicated with the 
Arab conquerers through interpreters. By the tenth century CE, the Coptic bishop 
Severus of Eshmunein complained that most Copts no longer understood either 
Greek or Coptic, only Arabic. In Upper Egypt, Coptic was limited to a few small 
pockets in the countryside and to the clergy in monasteries by the fourteenth cen-
tury CE (Versteegh 1997: 95). It is generally believed that by the sixteenth century 
CE the use of Coptic was restricted to liturgy in the Coptic church (cf. Loprieno 
1995: 7). In North Africa, Arabic became the dominant language of the cities, but 
Berber managed to resist the spread of Arabic in the rural interior. In Morocco and 
Algeria, in particular, Berber has retained its vitality alongside Arabic to this day. 
Likewise in limited areas in the Fertile Crescent, dialects of Syriac have persisted 
and have inﬂ uenced neighbouring Arabic dialects.
1.2.2 The development of Arabic
The Arabic of today is derived principally from the old dialects of Central and 
North Arabia which were divided by the classical Arab grammarians into three 
groups: Hijaz, Najd, and the language of the tribes in adjoining areas. Of these, 
the language of the Hijaz was considered to be the purest, while that of the neigh-
bouring tribes was felt to have been considerably contaminated by other Semitic 
and non-Semitic languages. It has been estimated recently that Arabic is the native 
language of about 200 million people (Holes 1995: 1). Arabic is the sole or joint 
oﬃ  cial language in twenty countries in a region stretching from Western Asia 
to North Africa. These are Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt,

in Chad, in some areas in the south of the Sahara, in some enclaves of the Central 
Asian republics of the old Soviet Union, in francophone West Africa, and among 
Arab communities in Europe and America.
1.2.3 The emergence of a standard language and diglossia
The literary Arabic language began to attain a standard form through the develop-
ment of grammatical norms in the eighth century CE (Fischer 1997: 188). This 
standard language can be termed Standard Arabic, the terms Classical Arabic and 
Modern Standard Arabic being used to describe its medieval and modern variants, 
respectively.7 Classical Arabic was based primarily on the language of the western 
Hijazi tribe of Quraysh, with some interference from pre-Islamic poetic koiné and 
eastern dialects. The language was codiﬁ ed in the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam. 
Although the lexis and stylistics of Modern Standard Arabic are rather diﬀ erent 
from those of Classical Arabic, the morphology and syntax have remained basi-
cally unchanged over the centuries (Fischer 1997: 188). The vernacular Arabic 
dialects, by contrast, have developed markedly during this period. Like a number 
of other languages, therefore, Arabic came to have one standard variety and a large 
number of regional and social dialects. Unlike many such languages, however, no 
one in the Arab world is brought up speaking Standard Arabic as their mother 
tongue:8 an Arab child’s mother tongue will be the regional or social variety of 
Arabic of its home region, while Standard Arabic, if it is mastered at all, is learnt 
formally at school or at home as part of the child’s education. Standard Arabic is 
conﬁ ned to formal written and spoken occasions, and the regional/social variety 
of Arabic is used at all other times. Standard Arabic now diﬀ ers considerably from 
regional and social colloquial varieties of Arabic in terms of its phonology, morph-
ology, syntax, and lexicon. According to Lipinski (1997: 75), such diglossia in 
Arabic began to emerge at the latest in the sixth century CE when oral poets recited 
their poetry in a proto-Classical Arabic based on archaic dialects which diﬀ ered 
greatly from their own (cf. also Vollers 1906; Wehr 1952; Diem 1973, cited in 
Fischer 1997: 188).
Dialects of Arabic form a roughly continuous spectrum of variation, with the 
dialects spoken in the eastern and western extremes of the Arab-speaking world 
being mutually unintelligible. On the basis of certain linguistic features, Arabic 
7 In this book, the term Standard Arabic is used when referring to the literary language in general; 
the terms Classical and Modern Standard Arabic are used for speciﬁ c reference to the ancient or mod-
ern varieties of the language, respectively.
8 The Hijazi dialect has developed markedly since the development of Classical Arabic, and Mod-
ern Standard Arabic is quite distinct from the modern dialect of Hijaz (Beeston 1970: 14).

dialects can be divided into two major geographical groups: the ﬁ rst comprises 
dialects spoken east of a line running from Salum in the north to roughly the 
Sudan–Chad border in the south; the second comprises the Maghribi dialects spo-
ken to the west of this line. The main phonological features which distinguish the 
western dialect group from the eastern include the typical reduction of the triangu-
lar system of short vowels, a, i, u, which is found in eastern dialects, to a two-vowel 
system (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 33); and a contrast between an iambic word-
stress system in the western group and a trochaic word-stress system in the eastern 
group. Thus, a word such as katab ‘he wrote’ will be typically stressed as katab 
in western dialects, but as katab in eastern dialects.9 In western dialects, the com-
bination of an iambic stress system together with a tendency to delete unstressed 
vowels leads to word-initial consonant clusters which are not typically attested in 
eastern dialects: in the Moroccan Arabic dialect of Lmnabha, smin ‘fat’ (Elmed-
laoui 1995: 139) is the cognate of Cairene sim¤n; and the word for ‘outside’ is real-
ized as ba in Lmnabha (Elmedlaoui 1995: 157), but as baa in Cairene.
Dialects of a language which has speakers as ethnically and socially diverse 
as Arabic, however, cannot be divided in purely geographic terms. Dialects are 
also commonly distinguished along a bedouin–urban axis: bedouin dialects tend 
to be more conservative and homogenous, while urban dialects show more evolu-
tive tendencies and usually exhibit fairly clear intra-dialectal variation based on 
reﬂ ex of Classical Arabic qƒf, preservation of the Classical Arabic interdentals, 
and a gender distinction in the second and third persons plural of the verb, pro-
nouns, and pronoun suﬃ  xes (Versteegh 1997: 144). Distinctions between bedouin 
and urban dialects appear to be less marked in the East, however, particularly in 
the Peninsula, than they are in North Africa (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 24).
1.3 THE PRESENT STUDY
Most accounts of the phonology and morphology of Arabic are fragmentary, with 
the information given in unpublished theses, journal articles, and works which 
address particular aspects of phonology or morphology taking examples from 
Arab ic. In this book, I seek to provide a more comprehensive and integrated 
account. I focus on two dialects from the eastern group: Cairene, and the dialect 
spoken within the old city of San’a (the capital of the Republic of Yemen). Where 
relevant I draw comparisons with Standard Arabic, and other modern varieties of 
near-eastern Arabic, including Central Sudanese, Palestinian, the Saudi Arabian 
dialect of Abha and other dialects of Yemeni Arabic.
9 There are, however, a number of eastern dialects (including that of the Negev Bedouin) and some 
dialects spoken in Upper Egypt and Oman, in which iambic stress is attested today (Fischer and Jastrow 
1980: 59–60).

San’ani is a dialect of the Arabian Peninsula, an area which has received little 
attention in generative work on the phonology and morphology of Arabic. It is 
closer to the descriptions we have of Classical Arabic than is Cairene. It also has 
considerably fewer speakers (circa 100,000 as opposed to a probable ﬁ gure of over 
12 million speakers of Cairene). Partly as a result of this and partly as a result of 
its history and tenacious hold on its own traditions, San’ani has experienced a far 
slower rate of linguistic change than Cairene. In many respects, the dialect is very 
conservative, exhibiting a number of features of phonology, morphology, and syn-
tax typically considered rural or bedouin (cf. Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 24). The 
reﬂ ex of the Classical Arabic phoneme qƒf, for example, is a voiced velar /g/, and 
the reﬂ ex of Classical Arabic j¤m a palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate //; the original form 
II ﬁ ccƒl and form V tiﬁ ccƒl verbal noun patterns are more commonly used than 
the taf  c¤l and tafaccul patterns found in Modern Standard Arabic; verb-initial as 
opposed to subject-initial clauses are typically used in narrative texts (cf. Holes 
1995: 210); and in possessive constructions direct annexion is often favoured over 
the use of an ‘of’ word (agg in San’ani)10 (cf. Versteegh 1997: 143). In its conso-
nantal phoneme system, San’ani maintains the triadic opposition attested in eighth-
century CE Classical Arabic between voiceless, voiced, and emphatic consonants 
in three sub-sets of the coronal set—see Figure 1.3.
In contrast to San’ani, Cairene is an innovative, urban dialect. It has maintained 
the voiceless uvular stop /q/ in religious terminology and other loan words from 
Standard Arabic, and through the inﬂ uence of foreign languages has gained seven 
additional marginal or quasi-phonemes. These are the emphatic // used almost 
exclusively in the word aƒh ‘God’ (cf. Testen 1997: 219–20) and derivatives, as in 
the majority of Arabic dialects, the emphatics //, /b/ and /m /, the voiceless bilabial 
stop, /p/, and the voiced palatoalveolar fricative, /ž/, and labio-dental fricative, /v/.
Through merger, Cairene has lost the Classical Arabic interdental phonemes 
*
, *, and *	. This historical loss of the interdental fricatives has led Cairene to

develop a four-way distinction for two sub-sets of the coronal set:11 voiceless-plain, 
voiced-plain, voiceless-emphatic, voiced-emphatic, as in Figure 1.4.
In terms of word-stress, Cairene contrasts with San’ani and the majority of other 
eastern dialects of Arabic which exhibit trochaic word-stress systems (for example, 
Classical Arabic, Central Sudanese, Palestinian, Saudi Arabian dialects) in its treat-
ment of peripheral feet. In a word comprising more than a single binary metrical 
foot, such as madrasa ‘school’, stress is assigned to the head of the ﬁ nal, periph-
eral foot in Cairene to give madrasa ‘school’. In San’ani, the ﬁ nal foot is deemed 
extrametrical and is therefore not taken into account in word-stress assignment. 
Thus, stress in San’ani is assigned to the rightmost non-extrametrical foot to give 
madrasih ‘school’.
and Modern Standard Arabic, San’ani, and a number of other bedouin-type Penin-
sula dialects in making no gender distinction in the second and third person plural 
independent and bound pronouns. Thus, while San’ani has the pronouns antayn 
‘you f.pl.’ and ant¶ ‘you m.pl.’, hum ‘they m.’ and hin ‘they f.’, Cairene simply 
has intu(m) ‘you pl.’ and humma ‘they’ to refer to both genders. Cairene has an 
enriched concatenative nominal morphology due in large measure to extended con-
tact with other languages and cultures. In addition, much of its non-concatenative 
morphology has been simpliﬁ ed, particularly in the derivation of verbal participles 
of derived verbs: where the active participle was once distinguished from the pas-
sive participle by the ﬁ nal stem vowel (i for active, a for passive), today the active 
participle of most derived verbs is distinguished from the passive participle by syn-
tactic or pragmatic context alone. However, the loss of non-concatenative morph-
ology in one part of the morphology is occasionally balanced by the development 
of non-concatenative morphology in another. In common with many eastern urban 
dialects of Arabic, Cairene has long since lost the apophonic (or internal) passive 
(Retsö 1983): thus, ‘a letter was written’ is kutibat risƒlatun in Standard Arabic 
with the /u-i/ vocalism of the verb indicating perfect passive, while in Cairene it 
is itkatab gawƒb with the passive indicated by aﬃ  xation of a passive preﬁ x to the

less velar stop, *k, has been preserved as such, the Proto-Semitic dorsal triad */g, k, q/ was also lost in

from their transitive counterparts, not by a diﬀ erent verbal form, as in many other 
eastern dialects of Arabic, but by a palatal (/i/) versus a guttural (/a/) vocalism (cf. 
Willmore 1905: 120, 121).12 Consider the paired examples in (8).

The present work, therefore, is a study of the phonology and morphology of one 
progressive and one conservative near-eastern dialect of Arabic. The two dialects 
have a number of similarities which enable us to classify them on one level as a 
group. As we have seen, these include a trochaic stress system, and the presence of 
a short vowel triad, /a, i, u/. Other similarities include the same basic syllable inven-
tory, and a simplex vocalic melody in basic form I verb stems. Diﬀ erences between 
the two dialects include, as discussed, the consonantal phoneme inventories, the 
treatment of peripheral feet in the stress system, and the presence or absence of 
gender distinction in second and third person plural independent and bound pro-
nouns. Other diﬀ erences include the number of long vowels (ﬁ ve in Cairene, three 
in San’ani), the identity of the default vowel (/a/ in San’ani, /i/ in Cairene), and the 
tolerance or intolerance of the dialect to initial consonant clusters.
12 In many cases at least, the /a/ type verb represents a restructured form IV.

THE PHONEME SYSTEM OF ARABIC
This chapter considers the development of the phoneme system in Arabic and 
establishes the phoneme systems for present-day San’ani and Cairene. I begin by 
considering the consonantal system of Classical Arabic as recorded by the found-
ing father of Arabic grammar, the eighth-century ce Arab grammarian, Amr ibn 
Uthman ibn Qanbar Sibawayh. Having established the consonantal system of Clas-
sical Arabic, I look at reﬂ exes of the Classical Arabic consonantal phonemes in 
modern dialects of Arabic. I then consider the consonantal system of San’ani and 
Cairene, showing that San’ani is far closer than Cairene in terms of its consonantal 
system to what we believe to have held for Classical Arabic. Finally, I consider the 
vocalic systems of Classical Arabic, and then of San’ani and Cairene.
2.1 CONSONANTS
By the time of the eighth century ce, Classical Arabic had twenty-eight consonan-
tal phonemes in nine places of articulation. The most probable articulations of 
these phonemes are shown in Table 2.1. In all modern Arabic dialects, there has 
been a change in the number and pronunciation of the consonantal phonemes. Dia-
lects which have exhibited most innovation in terms of pronunciation are the urban 
dialects spoken outside the Arabian Peninsula. Nomadic dialects and dialects of

2.1.1 Bilabials
The bilabials *b and *m have been maintained in all modern Arabic dialects. In 
some dialects, /b/ has a voiceless counterpart, /p/, used in loan words from lan-
guages such as Persian and French which have a voiceless bilabial stop in their 
inventories. A few dialects, including Cairene, have an emphatic labial nasal mar-
ginal phoneme /m / and a voiced emphatic labial marginal phoneme /b/.
2.1.2 Labio-dental
The labio-dental, *f, is maintained in all dialects. A few dialects, including Cairene, 
have a voiced quasi-phoneme /v/ which is usually restricted to loan words, such as 
villa ‘villa’, and generally found only in the speech of educated speakers.
2.1.3 Dentals
The four dental stops of Classical Arabic, *t, *d, *, *n have been maintained in 
all dialects. Dialects in which the interdentals have been lost (see Section 2.1.4) 
now have two plain and two emphatic dental plosives, /t, d, , /. The nasal stop, 
/n/, has a pharyngealized counterpart in a few modern dialects, including Lebanese 
(Nasr 1959a: 203). In most dialects, /t/ and /d/ are produced against the top of the 
upper incisors and are often diﬃ  cult for English speakers to distinguish from the 
interdentals /	/ and /
/. The emphatic voiceless dental plosive * may well have been 
voiced in Classical Arabic, but is pronounced as a voiceless pharyngealized dental 
stop in almost all dialects today. In some Yemeni dialects spoken in the Central 
plateau, including San’ani (Jastrow 1984; Behnstedt 1985: 46; Watson 1993b: 9), 
however, the phoneme is voiced in word-initial and intervocalic positions, as in:
(1) Underlying form Realization 
Gloss
 
/aw¤l/ 
[]aw¤l 
‘tall, long’
 
/maƒbix/ 
ma[]ƒbix 
‘kitchens’
In some sedentary dialects of Algeria and Morocco, the plain voiceless dental stop 
is palatalized or aﬀ ricated (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 49). Among certain speak-
ers of Cairene (particularly women), degrees of palatalization are attested in all 
four dental plosives and the dental nasal /n/ in the environment of palatal vocoids 
(Haeri 1997).
2.1.4 Interdentals
In nomadic dialects, sedentary dialects in the Arabian Peninsula (including the 
dialects of Yemen considered in this study), and rural sedentary dialects of Tu nisia, 

2.1 consonants
15
Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia, the interdental fricatives have been main-
tained.
In the sedentary dialects of Egypt, the large cities of Syria and Lebanon and 
many neighbouring areas, the original interdental fricatives *
, * and *	 merged 
with the dental stops *t, *d, *. In a very few words, of which zƒbi ‘oﬃ  cer’ and 
zƒlim ‘tyrant, oppressor’ are two, Cairene has an emphatic voiced alveolar frica-
tive (that is, sibilant) variant of Classical Arabic *	. In loan words from Standard 
Arabic generally, Cairene has sibilant reﬂ exes of the original interdentals—namely, 
sƒbit ‘ﬁ rm’ (< *
ƒbit), hƒza ‘this’ (< *hƒƒ) and zarf ‘envelope’ (< *	arf).
Several northern Mesopotamian dialects in Arab Afghanistan and Uzbekistan 
have sibilant reﬂ exes, /s, z, z/, of the Classical Arabic interdentals (Fischer and 
Jastrow 1980: 50).
In southern Anatolian Siirt, the original interdentals have become labiodentals 
/f, v, v./, as in: faclab ‘fox’ (< *
aclab), vahab ‘gold’ (< *ahab), varab ‘he hit’ (< 
*	arab) (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 50).
2.1.5 Sibilants
The sibilants *z, *s, *š, and * have maintained their phonemic status in most dia-
lects; however, the modern dental pronunciation of /s/ must post-date Sibawayh’s 
time since descriptions of eighth-century ce Classical Arabic s¤n suggest it had a 
realization more like modern-day š¤n, which was itself probably pronounced as a 
voiceless palatal fricative, [ç] (Lipinski 1997: 124; Watson 1992: 73–4). The move 
of š¤n from a palatal fricative to a palatoalveolar fricative probably took place 
because of the general instability of palatal fricatives (Watson 1999c; Watson and 
Dickins 1999): only 5 per cent of the world’s languages today have /ç/ in their pho-
neme inventory (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 165). In a few dialects spoken 
in the Maghrib (e.g. Meknes, Heath 1987: 15), and in Farafra and Central Bahari-
yya spoken in the oases of the western desert of Egypt, *s and *z have merged with 
*š and *ž (the latter derived from j¤m) to give sometimes /s/ and /z/, and sometimes 
/š/ and /ž/ (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 50). The emphatic voiceless dental–alveolar 
sibilant, *, has been mainly retained in the dialects, although in a number of dia-
lects spoken in Sudan and in some dialects spoken in the western mountain range 
of northern Yemen, // has lost some of its emphasis and is, in certain contexts, 
barely distinguishable from /s/. In some Sudanese dialects, * has disappeared

2.1.6 Palatals
The phoneme known as j¤m, which was realized either as a voiced palatal stop 
(Gairdner 1925: 23; Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 105; Watson 1992: 73) or as a

al together. In a few dialects of Yemeni Arabic spoken around the northern province 

the phoneme system of arabic
16
voiced palatalized velar stop (Schaade 1911: 73; Cantineau 1960: 58) in early Clas-
sical Arabic, is realized in most dialects today as a voiced palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate 
or velar stop. It has the reﬂ ex // in most Bedouin dialects, in many rural Syrian, 
Jordanian, Palestinian, and Mesopotamian dialects (Holes 1995: 61), and in the 
central region of northern Yemen (Behnstedt 1985: 42). In Cairene and in Yemeni 
dialects spoken in Ta’izz and in the Hugariyyah, the phoneme is realized as a 
voiced velar stop, /g/, as was probably the case in proto-Semitic (see Section 1.1.1) 
and early pre-Classical Arabic. The phoneme is realized as a voiced palatal stop, 
//, in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including some northern Yemeni dialects 
(Behnstedt 1985: 42), Upper Egypt and parts of Sudan (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 
105). In the Syrian desert, Khuzistan, Hadramawt, Dhofar, and the Gulf dialects, 
the sound has lenited to a palatal glide, /j/. In many areas of the Levant, especially 
the major cities of Beirut, Damascus, and Jerusalem (Holes 1995: 61) and in the 
majority of Maghribi dialects (cf. Heath 1987: 20–1 for Moroccan), the phoneme 
does not have an initial occlusive element and is realized as /ž/.
2.1.7 Liquids
The lateral *l has been maintained in all dialects. In most modern Arabic dialects, 
/l/ has an emphatic counterpart //. In many of these dialects, // is found exclu-
sively in aƒh ‘God’ and derivatives. In some southern Yemen dialects, including 
that of Ghaylabbƒn (Habtoor 1989: 31–3), the Classical Arabic emphatic lateral 
fricative articulation of ƒd is preserved as an allophone2 of ƒd and, according 
to Habtoor, is indistinguishable from the emphatic // in aƒh ‘God’. The dental 
tap *r is maintained in most dialects. However, in some Iraqi dialects (Blanc 1964; 
Johnstone 1975), the reﬂ ex of *r is a voiced post-velar fricative, similar to Parisien 
/r/. A number of dialects have an emphatic variant of /r/, //, whose distribution 
is sometimes determined by phonological context and for which several (near-) 
 minimal pairs with plain /r/ are attested, as in Cairene: ƒgil ‘man’ versus rƒkib 
‘rider, passenger’, ʔaa ‘he read’ versus bara ‘he sharpened’, bai ‘my land’ versus 
barri ‘pertaining to land’, ša ci ‘legal’ versus šarci ‘my street’. In several dialects, 
including San’ani, in which /r/ cannot be described as pharyngealized, /a/ has a 
back articulation preceding /r/, as in sƒrah ‘Sarah’ and jƒrat¤ ‘my neighbour f.’, but 
a front articulation following /r/, in words such as rƒgid ‘sleeping’.
2.1.8 Velars
The voiceless velar stop, *k, has been retained in most Arabic dialects. In Central 
Palestine it has become a palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate /cˇ/ (Holes 1995: 60), and in cer-
tain dialects spoken in the North of the Peninsula, in Jordan and in Iraq, /k/ has the

word. Where a liquid occurs, ƒd dissimilates to a voiced emphatic interdental fricative, as in: 	alam

2.1 consonants
17
fronted allophone [cˇ] in the environment of front vowels. In most dialects, includ-
ing Cairene and San’ani, /k/ has a voiced counterpart, /g/, which is a reﬂ ex of the 
early Classical Arabic voiced palatal stop in Cairene, and a reﬂ ex of the Classical 
Arabic voiceless uvular stop in San’ani.
2.1.9 Uvulars
The original uvular stop, *q, is maintained in many Syrian and North African dia-
lects, in the North Mesopotamian qeltu dialects (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 52), 
and, with a number of contextually determined allophones ([x, , q]), in sedentary 
dialects spoken in the west and south of the Arabian Peninsula (Behnstedt 1985: 
41). It has a glottal-stop reﬂ ex in the large cities around the Mediterranean, includ-
ing Cairo, Jerusalem, Damascus, and Beirut (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 52; Holes 
1995: 59). In many dialects in which the reﬂ ex of *q is a glottal stop, however, cer-
tain religious and Standard Arabic words are pronounced with a voiceless uvular 
stop, as in the following examples from Cairene:
(2) 
il-qƒhira 
‘Cairo’
 
il-qurʔƒn 
‘the Qur’an’
 
qarn 
‘century’
 
qawmi 
‘national’
 
qarya 
‘village’
In many regions of rural Palestine, the reﬂ ex of *q is a voiceless velar stop, and *k, 
which is most commonly realized as a voiceless velar stop in other dialects of Arab-
ic, has the reﬂ ex /cˇ/ (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 52; Holes 1995: 60). In Bedouin 
dialects and the dialects spoken in the central region of northern Yemen, including 
San’ani, the reﬂ ex of *q is a voiced velar stop, /g/.3 A vestige of the original uvular 
articulation of /g/ is seen in the back articulation of surrounding /a/ vowels in these 
dialects. Thus, the vowel quality of /ƒ/ in gƒl ‘he said’ and ʔigƒmih ‘residence’ in 
San’ani is the same as that in ƒl ‘condition, state’ and ƒm ‘he fasted’, and con-
trasts with the front vowel quality of /ƒ/ in kƒl ‘he measured’. In a few dialects 
spoken in western regions of northern Yemen, the reﬂ ex of *q is a voiced uvular 
stop, /G/ (Behnstedt 1985: 41). In Central Sudanese, *q in loans from Standard 
Arabic is interpreted as // (Sudanese // being realized as [] in most positions, 
but as [q] word ﬁ nally) (J. Dickins p.c.).
The uvular fricatives are mainly maintained, although for many dialects they 
are phonetically and phonologically better described as velar (Fischer and Jastrow 
1980: 52) or post-velar (e.g. Cairene, cf. Abdel-Massih 1975: 4). In Maltese, the 
reﬂ ex of *χ is // and *ʁ and * c have merged and collapsed to be realized only 
in the pharyngealization of surrounding vowels (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 52) if 
at all (Vanhove 1993: 9). In some dialects spoken in the western mountain range 
3 Vollers observed that wherever qƒf is voiced, j¤m has a palatal (or palatoalveolar) articulation 
(Vollers ZDMG xlix, 495, cited in Rabin 1951: 126).

the phoneme system of arabic
18
of northern Yemen, *ʁ has merged with * c and in diﬀ erent dialects has a reﬂ ex of 
either / c/ or /ʔ/. In an area to the north of San’a, *ʁ is realized as a voiceless uvular 
fricative; and in a few Yemeni dialects spoken in villages close to the Saudi border, 
the reﬂ ex of this phoneme is a voiceless uvular stop, /q/ (Behnstedt 1985: 44).
2.1.10 Pharyngeals
The pharyngeals * c and * have generally been maintained in non-peripheral 
 Arabic dialects. In dialects spoken in the central and northern Yemeni Tihama, how-
ever, * c has been reduced to a glottal stop /ʔ/ (Greenman 1979; Behnstedt 1985: 
43). In Maltese, * c (merged with *ʁ, cf. Section 2.1.9) has been reduced to a virtual 
phoneme which does not always correspond to an acoustic fact (Vanhove 1993: 9). 
In a number of peripheral Arabic dialects, including Nigerian and Chadian, * c and 
* have been de-pharyngealized to /ʔ/ and /h/ respectively (Owens 1993: 118).
2.1.11 Glottals
The glottal stop, known as hamza in Arabic, was attested in all prosodic positions 
in Classical Arabic: word-initially, as in ʔakal ‘he ate’; intervocalically, as in 
saʔal ‘he asked’ and suʔƒl ‘question’; pre-consonantally, as in raʔs ‘head’; post-
consonantally, as in badʔ ‘beginning’; and post-vocalically, as in xa	rƒʔ ‘green f.’. 
Today, the glottal stop has weakened in the majority of Arabic dialects. It is usually 
attested between two identical short vowels,4 as in Cairene saʔal ‘to ask’ and siʔim 
‘to become weary’; between two vowels of diﬀ ering quality the glottal stop is usu-
ally replaced by a glide, as in suwƒl ‘question’ < *suʔƒl and rƒyi ‘going’ < *rƒʔi; 
and in post-vocalic word-ﬁ nal position it has been lost, as in xara ‘green f.’ < 
*xa	rƒʔ. With the exception of several Peninsula dialects, including many spoken 
in Yemen (Jastrow 1980: 106–7; Watson 1989: 219–28), the glottal stop has been 
replaced by compensatory lengthening of the vowel in pre-consonantal position, 
as in Cairene rƒs ‘head’ < *raʔs and d¤b ‘wolf’ < *iʔb. The reﬂ exes of a number of 
common Standard Arabic glottal-stop–initial words are realized in several dialects 
with an initial glide, as in: wayn ‘where’ < *ʔayn, Cairene widn ‘ear’ < *ʔuun ‘ear’ 
and wƒkil ‘eating m.s.’ < *ʔƒkil, San’ani yƒj¶r ‘baked brick’ < *ʔƒjurr and Omani 
yƒl < *ʔƒl (cf. Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 39).
In many dialects, weakening of the glottal stop has extended beyond word-
 medial and word-ﬁ nal positions such that stems which were historically glottal-
stop initial are now vowel-initial in all but utterance-initial position. In several 
dialects in which *q is realized today as a glottal stop, however, in a number of ori-
ginal glottal-stop–initial content words the glottal stop has been maintained; and 
in careful speech vowel-initial words are realized with an initial glottal stop not 
only in utterance-initial position, but also following the deﬁ nite article and other-
4 Though not in Najdi, where the sequence aʔa is generally replaced by a long vowel, or the glottal 
stop by a voiced pharyngeal (Ingham 1994: 13–14).

wise in phonological-word–initial position. Examples from Cairene include: g¢t 
ʔimta ‘when did you m.s. come?’, camalt[i] ʔ¢h ‘what did you m.s. do?’, il-ʔabb 
‘the father’ and il-ʔumm ‘the mother’. In these cases, the glottal stop is analysed 
as prosthetic, and is distinguished from the lexical glottal stop which is derived 
from *q, and which has been maintained in the reﬂ exes of a few original glottal-
stop–initial content words.
In Jewish North African dialects, *h has totally disappeared. In several other 
dialects, the glottal fricative is maintained in content words, but the initial and ﬁ nal 
*h of pronoun suﬃ  xes has disappeared (Hamid 1984 for Sudanese; Nasr 1959b: 91 
for a dialect of Lebanese; Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 53): while in many Peninsula 
dialects, including San’ani, the feminine singular nominal ending is realized with 
ﬁ nal -h (/ah/ or /ih/), in the majority of dialects spoken outside the Peninsula the 
feminine ending is realized as a short vowel /a/ or /i/.
2.1.12 Glides
The labio-velar and palatal glides *w and *j have been maintained in all dialects. 
In some dialects, however—including Muslim Tunisian dialects, Damascene, and 
Central Sudanese (Hamid 1984)—they are pronounced as [u] and [i] between con-
sonants, respectively, before consonants in word-initial position, and after conso-
nants in word-ﬁ nal position (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 53).
2.2 THE CONSONANTAL SYSTEM OF SAN’ANI
San’ani has maintained all but two of the Classical Arabic places of articulation. 
The uvular place is no longer present in San’ani (the Classical Arabic voiceless 
uvular stop is realized as a voiced velar stop) and the original uvular fricatives are 
velar or post-velar. The palatal place is marginally present in the dialect: the ori-

ginal palatal stop has been replaced by a palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate. By virtue of the 
merger of the emphatic voiced coronals * and *	 to //, a voiced pharyngealized 
interdental fricative, San’ani has lost one of the consonantal phonemes of Classic-
al Arabic. The consonantal system of San’ani therefore comprises twenty-seven 
core phonemes arranged in eight places of articulation—see Table 2.2.
San’ani has one marginal phoneme, namely, //, a pharyngealized lateral 
(emphatic counterpart of /l/). It is found only in the word aƒh ‘God’ and deriva-
tives. The original voiceless uvular stop, *q, is not realized in any lexemes in the 
dialect. Even religious and Standard Arabic words are pronounced with a voiced 
velar stop, /g/, as in: al-gurʔƒn ‘the Qur’an’.
2.3 THE CONSONANTAL SYSTEM OF CAIRENE
In contrast to San’ani, Cairene has lost the interdental fricatives; hence Cairene 
has one core place of articulation and two core phonemes less than San’ani. Like 
San’ani, Cairene marginalized the palatal place of early Classical Arabic. Histor-
ically, the voiced palatal stop moved back on the palate to be realized as a voiced 
velar stop, while the palatal fricative moved forward. There is no core uvular place 
in Cairene: reﬂ exes of the uvular fricatives are realized as velar or post-velar frica-
tives, and, with the exception of religious and Standard Arabic lexemes, the reﬂ ex 
of *q is a glottal stop. The emphatics, * and *	, merged to be realized as a voiced 
pharyngealized dental–alveolar stop //. The consonantal system of Cairene com-
prises twenty-ﬁ ve core phonemes arranged at seven places of articulation —see 
Table 2.3.
Cairene has eight marginal phonemes. The phonemic status of most of these is 
often dubious at best, since they tend to be restricted to loan words and minimal 
pairs are diﬃ  cult to ﬁ nd. The marginal phonemes /p/ and /v/ are also restricted 
to the speech of educated speakers. The most common and most phonemic-like 
of the marginal phonemes is the pharyngealized dental–alveolar tap //. Marginal

phonemes attested in the dialect or among certain speakers of the dialect include:

 voiceless uvular stop. Restricted to religious and Standard Arabic lexemes, 
e.g. il-qurʔƒn ‘the Qur’an’, il-qƒhira ‘Cairo’;
// 
 pharyngealized dental–alveolar tap (emphatic counterpart of /r/). Found pre-
dominantly in European loans and in native words with guttural vowels, e.g. 
baašutt ‘parachute’, baʔai ‘my cows’. Several minimal pairs are attested 
including: barr ‘to look after o.s.’ versus ba ‘to be faithful (to a promise)’;
/b/ 
 pharyngealized bilabial stop (emphatic counterpart of /b/). A few minimal 
pairs are attested, including bƒba ‘pope, pontiﬀ , patriarch’ versus bƒba ‘sec-
ond month of Coptic year (mid-October to mid-November)’;
/m /  pharyngealized bilabial nasal stop (emphatic counterpart of /m/). Harrell pro-
vides a small number of near-minimal contrasts and one true minimal con-
trast with /m/: m ayyiti ‘my water’ versus mayyiti ‘my dead (one)’ (Harrell 
1957: 75);
// 
 pharyngealized lateral (emphatic counterpart of /l/). Found almost exclusive-
ly in the word aƒ ‘God’ and derivatives (cf. Section 2.1.7);
/p/ 
 voiceless bilabial stop. Found in a few loan words among educated speakers, 
e.g. par¤s ‘Paris’;
/ž/ 
 voiced palatoalveolar fricative. Found in a few loan words, e.g. žakitta ‘jack-
et’, bižƒma ‘pair of pyjamas’;
/v/ 
 voiced labio-dental fricative. Found in a few loan words among educated 
speakers, e.g. villa ‘villa’.
2.4 VOWELS
The major lexical contrasts in Arabic are indicated through the consonants. This 
is reﬂ ected in the Arabic script which is based on (mainly triconsonantal) roots of 
consonants and glides, and which inserts short vowels when necessary as diacritics 
above and below the consonant. Thus, Arabic has a very rich consonantal system 
and a relatively impoverished vocalic system.
2.4.1 Short vowels
Classical Arabic had three short vowel phonemes; two close vowels, palatal *i and 
labio-velar *u, and one open vowel, guttural *a.
Closed 
i  
u
Open 
 a
In certain dialects of Arabic today, *i and *u have collapsed to schwa to exhibit no, 
or only rare, distinction. These include the majority of North Mesopotamian dia-
lects, many bedouin dialects of the Maghrib, and Mauritanian (Fischer and Jastrow 

the phoneme system of arabic
22
1980: 54; Singer 1980: 250).5 This merger leaves these dialects with an eﬀ ective 
two-short-vowel system: open /a/ versus semi-closed /ə/. For a number of other 
dialects, an opposition between /i/ and /u/ exists in certain contexts, but has been 
reduced greatly. These include a few Syrian dialects including Aleppo, Tripolis, 
and Hawran (Grotzfeld 1965: 12–13; Versteegh 1997: 99, 146), and, to a lesser 
extent, certain dialects of Sudanese (J. Dickins p.c.) and Cairene. San’ani, in com-
mon with most dialects of Yemeni Arabic, preserves the opposition between the 
two close vowels in most contexts.
2.4.2 Long vowels
In contrast to short vowels, the opposition between /i/ and /u/ exists in all dialects 
in the long vowels. All modern dialects of Arabic have at least three long vowels, 
/ƒ/, /¤/, and /¶/. /¤/ and /¶/ have an articulation which is closer than that of their short 
counterparts, and /ƒ/ has a front articulation.

2.4.3 Diphthongs
The dialects also have diphthongs or monophthongs derived historically from diph-
thongs. The diphthongs are *ay and *aw, which coalesced historically in dialects 
such as Cairene, Central Sudanese (Hamid 1984: 27–8), and those spoken in much 
of the Levant, to be realized as /¢/ and /¥/. In San’ani and a number of Peninsula 
dialects, the diphthongs are maintained in all phonological contexts.
 
Palatal 
Labio-velar
San’ani

Cairene

Among some Cairene speakers, the monophthongs are shortened in closed syl-
lables to give short e and o, as in gozha ‘her husband’ (cf. g¥z ‘husband’), and 
ma calehš ‘never mind’ (cf. cal¢h ‘on him’).6 These latter are derived from long 
monophthongs resulting from historical diphthongs, hence the short mid vowels 
are not considered to be separate phonemes.
5 In non-bedouin dialects of the Maghrib, including Casablanca, Tangiers, and the Jewish dialect of 
Tunis, *a and *i have collapsed to schwa to give an opposition between rounded /u/ and unrounded /ə/ 
(Singer 1980: 249; Heath 1987: 27–8). According to Singer (1980), all short vowels have collapsed to 
schwa in some non-bedouin Maghrib dialects.
6 Among the majority of speakers of Cairene, short mid vowels are not attested (see Section 
3.4.11).

2.4 vowels
23
2.4.4 Cairene long vowels
The issue of long mid vowels in Cairene is more complicated. There is some evi-
dence that coalescence in Cairene is a historical process which no longer applies: 
Badawi and Hinds (1986) record a large number of words attested in Cairene with 
diphthongs intact, such as šayan ‘to behave naughtily’, dawla ‘state’, dawša ‘loud 
noise, din’. In addition, diphthongs derived through shortening of an unstressed 
long vowel are not subject to monophthongization. These include words such as 
cawza ‘[modal of desire f.s.]’ (< /  cƒwiz + a/), šayla ‘carrying f.s.’ (< /šƒyil + a/) 
and mudawla ‘consultation’ (< /mu + dƒwal + a/). Broselow suggests that the mas-
sive inﬂ ux of forms with diphthongs shows that at an earlier stage in the history 
of Cairene, forms which had undergone coalescence were reanalysed as having 
underlying long vowels and the rule of coalescence dropped out; as a result, 
newer forms with diphthongs were preserved intact (Broselow 1976: 152–3). This 
has lead to a situation today in which mid-vowel monophthongs contrast with 
derived diphthongs. The existence of minimal pairs involving diphthongs and long 
monophthongs, as in cawza ‘wanting f.s.’–c¥za ‘want, need’ and šayla ‘carrying 
f.s.’–š¢la ‘burden’, and among some speakers minimal pairs involving the short 
high vowels and shortened monophthongs, as in: gibna ‘cheese’–gebna ‘our pock-
et’ and ʔumna ‘we stood up’–ʔomna ‘our tribe’, necessitates the positing of a ﬁ ve-
member long vowel system for this dialect:

The historical development of Cairene has resulted in a system with a larger 
number of long vowels than short vowels. Interestingly, Maddieson’s study of the 
phoneme inventories of the 317 languages of the UPSID database shows that the 
higher mid long vowels /¢/ and /¥/ are far more likely to appear in a language with-
out corresponding short vowels of the same quality than any of the other vowels 
examined: 18 per cent of languages with /e(:)/ have only /¢/ and 19.6 per cent of 
languages with /o(:)/ have only /¥/. This contrasts with 6.6 per cent of languages 
with /¤/ but no /i/, 4.9 per cent of languages with /¶/ but no /u/, and 2.9 per cent of 
languages with /ƒ/ but no /a/ (Maddieson 1984: 130).

PHONOLOGICAL FEATURES
It has been long understood that speech sounds are not atomic, indivisible units, 
but that they are made up of a number of phonological features. In earlier work, 
speech sounds were represented as unordered sets or bundles of distinctive fea-
tures (Bloomﬁ eld 1933: 79; Chomsky and Halle 1968: 335 ﬀ ., Lass 1984: 94). 
Today it is understood that speech sounds are internally structured: certain groups 
of phonological features behave as units in assimilation processes; certain fea-
tures appear to be dependent on other features—[distributed] and [anterior], for 
example, are relevant for coronals and not for velars or labials; in assimilation 
processes certain spreading features appear to be contingent on the presence of 
features shared between the trigger and target (Cole 1987). The need to provide 
a structured representation of phonological features was ﬁ rst properly addressed 
in Clements’s (1985) paper entitled ‘The geometry of phonological features’ in 
which he proposed that features are arranged geometrically. Feature geometry rep-
resents both the separate and the coordinated aspects of features within a hierarch-
ical structure. In the model of feature geometry that I adopt, phonological features 
and feature values fulﬁ l the four basic criteria listed in (1).
(1) 1.  Phonological features are articulatorily appropriate.
 
2.  Phonological features and the relationships between phonological fea-
tures are suﬃ  cient to distinguish all the phonemes in the language.
 
3.  Phonological features are suﬃ  cient and necessary to account for phono-
logical processes in the language.
 
4.  The inventory of phonological features in a language is minimally redun-
dant.
In this work, I assume the feature geometry tree for Arabic given in (2). Root and 
root-dependent features combine independently substantiated proposals by Cle-
ments (1985), Sagey (1986), McCarthy (1988), Shaw (1991), and Halle (1992, 
1995). The organization of features attached to the place node is due to Selkirk 
(1988, 1993). Nodes which are not placed in square brackets are purely structural 
organizational nodes. Nodes which have no dependents are described as terminal 
nodes, and terminal nodes must have phonetic content. Organizational nodes such 
as the place and laryngeal nodes cannot occur terminally because they lack any 
phonetic content (Archangeli and Pulleyblank 1994: 21). Nodes which dominate 
other nodes lower down the tree are described as mother nodes, while the domi-
nated nodes are described as daughter nodes.

3.1 root features
25
Features are grouped into root features ([consonantal],1 [sonorant]), stricture 
features ([continuant], [nasal], [lateral]) and the acoustic feature ([strident]2 ), the 
laryngeal feature ([voice]), and place/articulator features ([labial], [coronal], [dor-
sal], [guttural]). In this model, I follow McCarthy in assuming that the supralaryn-
geal organizational node plays no role in the feature geometry (McCarthy 1988). 
I also follow McCarthy (1988), Shaw (1991), Halle (1992, 1995) and others in 
assuming that the nodes [consonantal] ([cons]) and [sonorant] ([son]) form the 
root of the feature tree. There are two principal reasons for this organization. First, 
[cons] and [son] rarely spread outside of complete assimilation, and placing the 
features in the root of the tree explains this point. Secondly, every language distin-
guishes consonants from vowels and sonorants from obstruents, but although most 
languages distinguish between at least one stop and fricative or nasal this is by no 
means universal—some Australian languages have no fricatives and some Salish 
languages lack nasals. Locating [cons] and [son] at the root of the tree expresses 
the intuition that higher-level features are more basic categories of contrast (Ken-
stowicz 1994: 453). Within the present model, all features are monovalent (cf. 
Anderson and Ewen 1987; van der Hulst 1989; Watson 1989; Rice 1990, 1994: 
114; Rice and Avery 1991: 104; Grijzenhout 1995: 166). The interaction of under-
speciﬁ cation and universal and language-speciﬁ c redundancy rules renders it 
unnecessary for any feature to be bivalent.
The grouping of [lateral] with the stricture features requires some comment. A 
small number of phonologists have argued that the feature [lateral] is a dependent 
of the [coronal] node on the basis that lateral sounds are virtually always [coronal] 
(for instance, Levin 1988; McCarthy 1988: 103; Pulleyblank 1988: 311; Blevins

1 Hume and Odden (1995, 1996) consider [consonantal] to be superﬂ uous, arguing that [consonan-
tal] never functions as the sole feature responsible for distinguishing segments. In this work, however, 
I maintain the feature [consonantal].
2 In contrast to Halle (1992) and others, Grijzenhout (1995) and Hall (1997) represent [strident] as 
a dependent of [coronal].

1994; Grij zenhout 1995). However in view of the generally agreed position that 
[coronal] is universally the default articulator (cf. Avery and Rice 1989; Rice and 
Avery 1991; Shaw 1991; Grijzenhout 1995),3 there is a strong counterargument 
that the speciﬁ cation of [lateral] as a dependent of [coronal] is unnecessary and 
undesirable. In an underspeciﬁ ed representation, if [lateral] were the daughter 
of the [coronal] node then not only [lateral], but also the mother node [coronal] 
would have to be speciﬁ ed in the underlying representation (Paradis and Prunet 
1991: 15), as in (3).

If [lateral] is a stricture feature attached directly to the root node, however, the fol-
lowing (universal) redundancy rule ensures that [lateral] segments have a [coronal] 
articulator:

The presence of velar laterals in certain languages of New Guinea also shows that 
laterals are not universally coronal (Maddieson 1984: 77; Ladefoged and Maddie-
son 1996: 190). I therefore assume that [lateral], in common with [strident], [con-
tinuant], and [nasal], is not bound to any one particular articulator.
3.1 ROOT FEATURES
The root features are [cons] and [son]. [Cons] denotes segments produced with ‘a 
constriction in the central passage through the oral cavity’ (Halle 1992, cited in 
Kenstowicz 1994: 453). On the basis of this deﬁ nition, [cons] implies constriction 
made with a primary [labial], [coronal], or [dorsal] articulator. Gutturals, which 
are produced in the laryngeo-pharyngeal zone, involve no oral constriction and are 
not [cons]. Obstruents and sonorant stops (nasals and liquids) are [cons]. Vowels, 
glides and approximants lack the feature [cons]. [Son] segments are produced with 
a vocal tract conﬁ guration suﬃ  ciently open that the air pressure inside and outside 
the mouth is approximately equal (Halle and Clements 1983: 6). Vowels, glides, 
nasals and liquids are [son]. The features [cons] and [son] distinguish the major 
sound classes, as in (5).
3 However, on the basis of phonotactic restrictions, Grijzenhout (1998) argues that coronal speciﬁ -
cation plays a crucial role in German and Dutch and that velars lack a C-place feature.

3.2 STRICTURE FEATURES
The ‘manner’ or stricture features are attached to the root (but not located in the 
root).4 Segments involving [lateral] are produced by lateral release of air; seg-
ments involving [nasal] are produced with an open nasal cavity and hence nasal 
release of air; and segments involving [continuant] ([cont]) are marked by an unin-
terrupted airﬂ ow through the midsagittal region of the oral tract. The stricture 
features are supplemented by the acoustic/auditory feature [strident]; [strident] is 
used to describe the high-pitch intensity associated with sibilants. Articulatorily, 
[strident] sounds involve midsagittal grooving of the tongue to channel the airﬂ ow 
downstream onto an obstacle, typically the teeth (Laver 1994: 261). The stricture 
features distinguish the types of consonantal sonorants and obstruents—see (6).

3.3 LARYNGEAL FEATURES
The only laryngeal feature relevant for Arabic is [voice]. [Voice] describes the 
vibration of the vocal cords. Segments which lack the feature [voice] are produced 
with open vocal cords. Aspiration is not a feature of Arabic consonants on the 
whole: aspirated consonants are distinguished from non-aspirates by the feature 
[cont]. Thus, the pure laryngeal aspirate /h/ is distinguished from the pure laryn-
geal non-aspirate by the presence of [cont] for the former and not for the latter.

4 In models which incorporate a supralaryngeal organizer node, the ‘manner’ or stricture features 
are attached to the supralaryngeal node (e.g., Booij 1995: 10).

3.4 PLACE/ARTICULATOR FEATURES
For the representation of features attached to the place node, I assume an abstract 
reductionist model based on Selkirk’s 1993 [Labial]-Only Theory. In [Labial]-
Only Theory, Selkirk proposes that [labial] is the only feature in the universal reper-
toire of phonological features available for the representation of labiality, whether 
it takes the form of bilabial compression, labiodental retraction, or lip rounding. 
Any theory of phonological features which lacks a distinct representation for labio-
dentals, for instance, hands over to the phonetics the task of specifying whether 
a labial consonant is realized with bilabial compression (b, m, p) or with retrac-
tion of the lower lip (f, v). In the same way, any theory which lacks the feature 
[round] is committed to saying that all realizations of [labial] as rounding are pre-
dictable (Selkirk 1993: 2). In her 1993 manuscript, Selkirk demonstrates that since 
the details of the shape and location of [labial] articulations are always predictable 
as a matter of default speciﬁ cation, what might be called [Labial]-Only Theory can 
be maintained. This is summed up in (8) (Selkirk 1993: 2).
(8) The [Labial]-Only Theory of the Place Feature Repertoire
 
 The place feature repertoire of phonological theory includes only the feature 
[labial] for the representation of labial articulation.
[Labial]-Only Theory contrasts with [labial]-plus theories which maintain that the 
features [round] and [labiodental] may play a role in the phonology. In [Labial]-
Only Theory, the feature repertoire is reduced to four places of articulation termed 
cover features. These four cover features are {labial, coronal, dorsal, gut-
tural}. Broadly, [labial] describes segments produced by constriction of the labia; 
[coronal] describes segments produced by the tongue tip and blade; and [dorsal] 
describes segments produced by the tongue body. In contrast to the other features 
attached to the place node, [guttural] denotes a zone of articulation, rather than 
an articulator, and distinguishes segments produced in the laryngeo-pharyngeal 
region (see Section 3.4.5). Therefore in what follows I describe {labial, coronal, 
dorsal} as articulators, and [guttural] as a place. When referring to the features 
attached to the place node as a group, I shall use the term place features. In 
the present model, [guttural] takes the place of Selkirk’s (from McCarthy’s) [pha-
ryngeal], and in contrast to McCarthy (1991) and Halle (1992), [guttural] is a sister 
of all other place features, not a daughter of a separate pharyngeal class node. The 
feature repertoire has no phonetically grounded prime features which realize 
the cover feature. Selkirk argues that phonological features can be reduced to a 
minimum by allowing the phonetic interpretation of place features to account for 
the realization of a particular feature in a particular context, and thus phonetically 
grounded prime features are introduced by default rules in the phonetic interpret-
ation. The Phonetic Interpretation of Place Features has three parts and is given 
in (9) (Selkirk 1993: 3).

3.4 place/articulator features
29
 (9) The Phonetic Interpretation of Place Features
 
(a )  The Phonetic Interpretation of Primary Place (PIPP)
 
   
 The phonetic realization of a primary place feature is necessarily contin-
gent on the stricture features of the segment containing it. It may also 
be contingent on non-primary place features of the segment.
 
(b) The Phonetic Interpretation of Non-primary Place (PINP)
 
   
 The phonetic realization of a non-primary place feature may be inde-
pendent of the other features of the segment containing it, or it may be 
contingent on the other place and/or stricture features of the segment.
 
(c) Rank–Stricture Correspondence (RSC)
 
   
 The degree of constriction in the articulation realizing a non-primary 
place feature in a segment does not exceed the degree of constriction of 
the articulation of a primary place feature in the same segment.
Crucially, the stricture of a segment is responsible for the phonetic interpretation 
of the place feature in a particular context. From the investigation of labials in 
a large number of languages, Selkirk observes that the following generalization 
holds (Selkirk 1993: 54):
(10) The phonetic interpretation of primary [labial]
 
1. A primary [labial] stop is bilabial.
 
2. A primary [labial] fricative is labiodental.
 
3. A primary [labial] vocoid is round.
This does not mean to say that no language could have bilabial fricatives or labio-
dental stops or that primary [labial] in vocoids could not be realized as other than 
round; however, (10) should be understood as a strong generalization based on 
the investigation of a large number of languages, and certainly as what will hold 
in case the phonology of a particular language fails to specify that a segment is 
[round] or [labiodental], etc. This articulator-only approach holds not only for 
the [labial] articulator but also for the articulators [coronal] and [dorsal], and for 
the place feature [guttural]. In this chapter, I discuss primary versus non-primary 
place and then consider the representation of Cairene and San’ani consonantal 
and vocalic phonemes within an articulator-only approach. Within the discussion, 
I consider the [coronal]–front vowel debate and argue that a [coronal] representa-
tion of front (or palatal) vocoids is inappropriate since it fails to meet the criteria 
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. I demonstrate that maximization of the 
cover feature [dorsal] in an articulator-only approach can provide a far more articu-
latorily and phonologically appropriate representation of the palatal vocoids.
3.4.1 Primary versus non-primary place
Segments which are multiply articulated are characterized as having more than 
one feature from the set {labial, coronal, dorsal, guttural}. Phonetically the mul-

phonological features
30
tiple articulations of these segments may be either of equal constriction, as in w 
and doubly-stopped kp, or of unequal constriction, as in labialized kw and palatal-
ized t j. Where one constriction is more radical than the other the more radical con-
striction is traditionally held to be the primary articulation, with the less radical 
constriction described as the secondary articulation.5 A crucial aspect of the the-
ory adopted here is the assumption that in phonological terms the primary/non-
primary distinction is necessarily at play in all multiply-articulated segments (as 
ﬁ rst proposed by Anderson 1976), even where the multiple articulations in a par-
ticular segment are (or appear to be) identical in constriction (Selkirk 1993: 6).6 
Thus, a labial-velar consonant /kp/ or /gb/ in a language patterns phonologically 
either with velar consonants, or with labial consonants, but not with both, and the 
phonological identiﬁ cation of /kp/ as a labialized velar or as a velarized labial 
derives from the overall, language-speciﬁ c system of segmental oppositions, and 
not from the phonetics of the consonant (Anderson 1976: 22). In the consonant 
systems of Anum and Eﬁ k, the voiced labial /b/ is present, the voiceless member 
/p/ is absent, and there is also an unpaired labial-velar /kp/. These two languages 
also have a plain and a labialized velar, /k/ and /kw/, which are distinct. Since the 
labial-velar /kp/ contrasts with /kw/, /kp/ cannot also be a velar with secondary 
labialization, and thus /kp/ appears as a labial with secondary velarization (Ander-
son 1976: 23). Similarly, the labial-coronal stop /tp/ is phonologically a primary 
[coronal] in Abkhaz, but an allophone of a primary [labial] phoneme in Nzema 
(Berry 1955; Anderson 1971, both cited in Selkirk 1993: 74). The observation that 
multiply-articulated segments necessarily involve a primary/non-primary place 
distinction even where the two articulations are identical in the degree of constric-
tion leads to the constraint in (11), ruling out representations with dual primary 
place (Selkirk 1993: 32):
(11) No dual primary place
*Root
Place

place ii
 
In Selkirk’s model, as here, the primary feature is represented as immediately 
dominated by the place node, while the non-primary feature is immediately dom-
inated by the primary feature. Accordingly, the representation of place features of 
the labial-velar /kp/ in Anum and Eﬁ k is as in (12).
5 Following Selkirk, I use the term non-primary rather than secondary to describe the less radical 
constriction (Selkirk 1993: 5).
6 This contrasts with the dual-primary status of kp assumed by Ladefoged and Maddieson (1988), 
Smith (1988) and Clements (1991), (Selkirk 1993: 5).

Arabic has no labial-velar stops, but it does have the doubly articulated labio-velar 
glide /w/ and vowel /u/. The labio-velar vocoids pattern with the palatal vocoids in 
the language; hence they are analysed as primary [dorsal] and non-primary [labial], 
and therefore have the opposite arrangement of place features as Anum/Eﬁ k /kp/ 
in (12).
The model adopted here draws a distinction between place features and nodes. 
However, in contrast to some other feature geometry models, place features may 
not spread independently of the nodes with which they are associated. The fea-
tures can be thought of as labelling the nodes, but not as being independent of the 
nodes. This feature–node theory makes available the possibility of representing 
non-terminal empty nodes, that is, nodes with no labelling by a particular place 
feature (Selkirk 1993: 27), as in (13).

The empty node has the status of a place holder and makes it possible to represent 
the deletion of a primary feature without the necessary deletion of the non-primary 
feature or its promotion to primary status. The possibility of empty non-terminal 
place nodes will be shown to be crucial in the representation of interdentals in 
San’ani.
3.4.2 [Labial]
[Labial] describes constriction by the lips and, particularly as a non-primary fea-
ture, involves expansion of the vocal tract at the lips. Under an articulator-only 
approach, the [labial] phonemes of Cairene and San’ani are distinguished by the 
interaction of the root features [cons] and [son], the laryngeal feature [voice], and 
the stricture features [cont] and [nasal]. Three of the phonemes in (14), /b, m, f/, 
are marked by primary [labial] while the vocoid /w, u/ is marked by non-primary 
[labial] as a daughter to primary [dorsal].

It has long been recognized that not all phonological properties of a segment need 
to be represented underlyingly, since certain features are predictable from the pres-
ence of other features (cf. Booij 1995: 12). For example, sonorants are assigned 
the feature [voice] redundantly, because [voice] is predictable from the presence 
of [son]. Similarly, [son] is predictable from the presence of [nasal]. The matrix 
in (14) has a number of predictable features. Removal of these redundant features 
gives the matrix in (15).

3.4.3 The [coronal]–front vowel debate
In recent years, there has been considerable debate over the representation of front 
vowels on the basis of phonological relationships between front vowels and palat-
alized consonants. In Hume (1992) and Clements and Hume (1995), the feature 
[coronal] links true coronals, palatal consonants, and palatal vocoids. As I show 
in earlier work (Watson 1999b; Watson and Dickins 1999), there are a number of 
problems with this approach. First, in terms of their articulation, palatal vocoids 
bear considerably more resemblance to other [dorsal] sounds than to [coronal] 
sounds, and thus a [coronal] representation of palatal vocoids fails to fulﬁ l the 
criterion of articulatory appropriateness in (1) above. Secondly, while [coronal] 
is the unmarked feature in consonants and is underspeciﬁ ed across a wide range 
of languages, palatal consonants are extremely rare. And thirdly, as I show below, 

3.4 place/articulator features
33
a [coronal] representation of palatal vocoids fails to account for the relationship 
between the target of palatalization processes and the trigger.
One of the main motivations for use of [coronal] in the representation of palatal 
vocoids is [coronal]–front vowel relationships found in various forms in a number 
of languages, including Acadian French, Maltese, and Slovak. Broadbent (1997) 
reanalyses the consonant–vowel interactions in Maltese and shows that the con-
nection between coronal consonants and front vowels in the imperfect verb in this 
language can be attributed far more simply to coronal underspeciﬁ cation. In this 
chapter, I shall discuss the data from Acadian French and Slovak since it is simi-
lar to palatalization processes which occur at least historically in Arabic (Watson 
1992). I argue that an account of the phonological processes involved can be pro-
vided, not on the basis of a shared feature [coronal], but rather on the basis of Uni-
versal Markedness Conventions.
In Acadian French, optional rules of palatalization and coronalization shift the 
velar consonants /k, g/ to palatalized velars [kj, gj] or palatoalveolar aﬀ ricates [tš, 
] before front vowels, as in (18).
(18) 
/kø/ 
kø~kjø~tšø 
‘tail’
 
/gεte/ 
gjεte~gjεte~εte ‘to watch for’
This is interpreted as spreading of the coronal feature of the front vowel onto 
the velar consonant (Hume 1992; Clements and Hume 1995: 294–5). Coronal 
links under the vocalic place node of the consonant with interpolation of a new 
vocalic place node to retain well-formedness. To move from kj to tš, Clements 
and Hume claim that the minor coronal articulation may be optionally reassigned 
major articulatory status by a process known as promotion whereby the minor 
articulation of the consonant is delinked and copied under the consonantal-place 
node, where it replaces the original major dorsal articulation (Clements and 
Hume 1995: 295).
Slovak has no intermediate palatalization phase: the velars /k, g, x, / are real-
ized as [tš, , š, ] respectively when followed by a front vocoid. Coronalization 
is interpreted by Hume (1992) as the [coronal] feature of the front vowel spread-
ing directly to the C-place node of the velar and replacing the original [dorsal] 
feature.

While the Clements and Hume model goes some way towards explaining the 
 relationship between the trigger and the output in palatalization processes, it sin-
gularly fails to explain the relationship between either the trigger and the velar 
target or the velar target and the outcome. As Goad and Narasimhan (1994) point 
out, there is nothing in the Hume (1992) approach (carried forward in Clements 
and Hume 1995) to preclude palatalization of labials before front vowels, and 
while velar fronting is a common process, labial palatalization (resulting in [tš]) is 
very rare.
In Watson (1999b) and Watson and Dickins (1999), it is argued that both of 
these phonological processes can be explained as instances of catastrophic shift on 
the basis of Universal Markedness Conventions. Palatalization processes are very 
common in the world’s languages. However, palatal consonants are not, and both 
palatal stops and fricatives are highly marked. Less than 5 per cent of languages 
include the palatal fricative /ç/ in their phoneme inventory, and the voiced palatal 
fricative // is even more rare (Maddieson 1984; Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 
165). This is almost certainly due to the physiological diﬃ  culty of producing pal-
atal stops and fricatives, on the one hand, and their lack of auditory distinctness, on 
the other. Where palatal stops do occur in a language, as in a number of northern 
Yemeni dialects of Arabic (Watson 1989; Behnstedt 1985: 42; Jastrow 1980: 105) 
and Sudanese (Kaye 1976: 7; Reichmuth 1983: 12), they often have coronal and 
velar allophones in some cases in free variation (Kaye 1976: 84–5). Similarly, the 
palatal fricative /ç/ in German is realized as [x] in the environment of back vowels 
and, in some dialects of German, has been reinterpreted as the considerably less 
marked palatoalveolar fricative /š/ (S. J. Hannahs, p.c.). Where palatal consonants 
are involved, either as part of the phoneme inventory of the language or as a result 
of palatalization processes, catastrophic shifts are likely to occur in the direction 
of articulations which are both more auditorily and acoustically distinctive and 
easier to produce. While the equation of palatal vowels with [coronal] has a cer-
tain appeal in explaining the relationship between the trigger and the outcome in 
the cases of palatalization and coronalization mentioned above, this use of [coro-
nal] actually serves to obscure the issue—namely, that palatal for consonants is a 
highly-marked place of articulation and is, where possible, avoided.
Furthermore, as Elmedlaoui points out (1995: 204–8), any account of palatals 
and palatalization which involves the feature [coronal] (as in Keating 1988; Cle-
ments 1991; Hume 1992; Clements and Hume 1995) fails to provide an account of 
de-coronalization processes found in languages such as Riﬁ an Berber (Elmedlaoui 
1995: 196–7). In the speech of the older generation, the vocoids /i, j/ devoice to [] 
to the left of a voiceless consonant, as in (20).
(20) amrwøj (masc.) amrwø (fem.) ‘cow [pejorative]’
To the left of a coronal strident, however, the coronalized palatal  derived from 
the devoicing of /i, j/ is decoronalized and realized as a pure palatal fricative [ç] 
(Elmedlaoui 1995: 196, 197, 207):

3.4 place/articulator features

If palatalization and coronalization were both represented by non-primary [coro-
nal], there would be no way of adequately capturing the fact that decoronalized  is 
realized as palatal [ç]. In this sense, [coronal] as a representation of palatal vocoids 
fails to meet the third criterion for phonological features and feature values men-
tioned in (1), and repeated here for convenience:
(22)  Phonological features are necessary and suﬃ  cient to account for phono-
logical processes in the language.
3.4.4 [Dorsal]
[Dorsal] describes constriction by the tongue body and, particularly as a non-
primary feature, involves pharyngeal expansion. In recent work (Watson 1999b; 
Watson and Dickins 1999), I propose that the debate over the representation of 
palatal vowels can be resolved by maximizing the cover feature [dorsal] in an 
articulator-only approach and by allowing phonetic interpretation in conjunction 
with Universal Markedness Conventions to realize segments containing [dorsal] 
in a particular context with a particular stricture. Thus, a primary [dorsal] stop 
is predicted to be velar (/g/, /k/), since virtually every language has velar stops 
(Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 33). A primary [dorsal] fricative is predicted 
to be post-velar (/x/, //), but not uvular: [dorsal] uvular fricatives (/χ/, /ʁ/) are 
distinguished from [dorsal] velar fricatives by the additional speciﬁ cation of non-
primary [guttural]. Finally, [dorsal] vocoids are predicted to be palatal (/i/, /j/): 
Maddieson (1984: 94) shows that while the majority of languages in the UPSID 
database have /i/ and /u/, there are more cases where /u/ is missing than /i/. There 
are also three times as many cases of /w/ occurring without /u/ than of /j/ occur-
ring without /i/ (Maddieson 1984: 92). Since /i/ is frequently involved in parasitic 
harmony processes with /u/ as the target but never the trigger of harmony (Cole 
1987; Cole and Trigo 1988; Watson 1989, 1993a, 1995a), /i/ should bear no feature 
lacked by /u/, while the non-primary feature [labial] distinguishes /u/ from /i/ (and 
/w/ from /j/). The common feature shared by /i/ and /u/ is [dorsal]. The phonetic 
interpretation of primary [dorsal] is summed up in (23).
(23) The phonetic interpretation of primary [dorsal]
 
1. A primary [dorsal] stop is velar.
 
2. A primary [dorsal] fricative is post-velar.
 
3. A primary [dorsal] vocoid is palatal.
This interpretation does not imply that no language will have palatal stops or frica-
tives, but it does say that palatal stops and fricatives are highly marked. Accepting 
the arguments in Broadbent (1994, 1996, 1999) that front vowels are not coronal, 

phonological features
36
I claim that the only vowels represented by the feature [coronal] (primary or non-
primary depending on the phonology of the language) are central vocoids, includ-
ing the vowel schwa. I further propose the vocoid default rule in (24) which states 
that a primary [dorsal] vocoid is assigned non-primary [dorsal] in the default case 
(if, for example, spread of non-primary [labial] does not occur).
(24) Vocoid default rule
[dorsal]

Rule (24) has the status of a markedness statement such that only in the marked 
case does the phonology of a language fail to assign a non-primary speciﬁ cation 
to a primary [dorsal] vocoid (allowing the vocoid to be realized as the high, back 
unrounded vowel, [ɯ], or approximant, [γ], depending on its position within the 
syllable).7 I further assume that non-primary [dorsal] is assigned early in the deriva-
tion to a [dorsal] vocoid which associates directly with the syllable node or which is 
linked to two moras. This ensures that only [dorsal] vowels linked to a single mora 
are underspeciﬁ ed for non-primary place, and explains the propensity of monomo-
raic [dorsal] vowels alone to assimilate the non-primary place of adjacent vocoids.
As with [labial] sounds, [dorsal] sounds are distinguished from one another by 
the interaction of the root feature [son], the laryngeal feature [voice], and the stric-
ture feature [cont]. (There are no [nasal] dorsal phonemes in either Cairene or 
San’ani, therefore [nasal] is not an active feature in the speciﬁ cation of [dorsal]s.) 
Consider the fully speciﬁ ed matrix in (25) in which the dorsal sounds of the dia-
lects are distinguished.8

In this matrix, [voice] is predictable from the presence of [son]. The removal of 
this feature for /j, i/ gives the following matrix:

7 In Maddieson’s survey, only ﬁ ve instances of /γ/ are found in the 317 languages of the UPSID data 
base (Maddieson 1984: 92).
8 In Cairene and San’ani, the [dorsal] fricatives are phonetically post-velar but phonologically velar, 
and hence [dorsal]: in contrast to all other post-velar consonants in the dialects, they have no eﬀ ect 
on adjacent vowels. In certain other modern Arabic dialects, including North Palestinian Druze (Jakob-
son 1957), [dorsal] fricatives are phonetically and phonologically uvular and are analysed as emphatic 
[dorsal]s.

3.4.5 [Guttural]
In Arabic, as in Semitic generally, the laryngeals, pharyngeals, and uvular frica-
tives pattern together phonologically as a guttural class in a number of areas. First-
ly, in Arabic, Maltese, and Ethiopian Semitic, guttural consonants lower adjacent 
vowels. In Maltese, the imperfect preﬁ x vowel is realized as [a] when followed 
by a stem-initial guttural, but as [i] elsewhere (Brame 1972, cited in Hayward 
and Hayward 1989: 185), as in: ni+kteb ‘I write’ and ni+nzel ‘I descend’ versus 
na+ʔbez ‘I jump’ and na+ʔleb ‘I overturn’. In Najdi Arabic, the initial vowel of 
the perfect verbal stem is realized as [i] unless the ﬁ rst or second consonant is 
a guttural, in which case it is realized as [a]: afar ‘he dug’ contrasts with kitab 
‘he wrote’ (Ingham 1994: 19); and in San’ani Arabic, the nominal {feminine singu-
lar} suﬃ  x is realized as [ih]9 unless preceded by an adjacent guttural consonant, 
in which case it is realized as [ah]: the suﬃ  x in kar¤hah ‘hateful f.s.’ contrasts 
with that in gar¤bih ‘near f.s.’. Secondly, root co-occurence restrictions in Semitic 
described by Greenberg (1950) show an avoidance of roots built from two dis-
tinct members of the guttural set. Thirdly, in Tiberian Hebrew (McCarthy 1994: 
215–16) and in many Bedouin dialects of the Arabian Peninsula, a laryngeal or 
pharyngeal may not fall in coda position. An original coda guttural will induce 
epenthesis with stress assigned to the epenthesized vowel: *gahwah is realized in 
Arabic Bedouin dialects as gahawah ‘coﬀ ee’, *amar as amar ‘red’ and *yacrif 
as ycarif or ycarf (Blanc 1970; Jastrow 1980: 109; Ingham 1994: 19 for Najdi).10 A 
similar phenomenon is witnessed in Jibbali where stress cannot fall on a vowel pre-
ceding a guttural consonant (Johnstone 1981, cited in Hayward and Hayward 1989: 
182). And, fourthly, a number of Semitic languages—including Tigre and Tiberian 
Hebrew—prohibit guttural geminates (Moscati et al. 1964: 161;  McCarthy 1994: 
216–17). Phonetically, the gutturals pattern together insofar as they share a high 
F1 value and constriction in the back of the vocal tract.
Observations such as these have lead Hayward and Hayward (1989), McCarthy 
(1991, 1994), and others to recognize ‘guttural’ as a natural class in generative 
phonology. McCarthy (1991, 1994) proposes recognition of this class through the 
feature [pharyngeal], and Hayward and Hayward (1989) through the feature [gut-
tural]. It is [guttural] which I adopt here.
 9 When a pharyngealized coronal falls in the same word, the {feminine singular} suﬃ  x is realized 
as [uh] (see Section 10.5).
10 Note that from this point on, I represent the palatal glide as /y/ and the palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate as 
/j/, in common with Arabist practice.

phonological features
38
The feature [guttural] denotes a zone of articulation with constriction in the 
laryngeo-pharyngeal region, that is, in that part of the vocal tract which extends 
from the end of the oral cavity (i.e. the uvula) to the larynx (Hayward and Hayward 
1989: 187–8; cf. McCarthy 1994: 192), rather than a single speciﬁ ed articulator: 
laryngeals are produced with a ‘glottal’ articulator; pharyngeals may involve any 
of a number of gestures, and are produced in some languages through constric-
tion near the epiglottis (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 169), and in others by 
means of a lateral compression of the pharynx immediately behind the oral cavity 
(Catford 1977: 163); and uvular fricatives are produced through retraction of the 
tongue-root to the posterior wall of the upper pharynx.
Thus, [guttural] describes general pharyngeal constriction and contrasts with 
the pharyngeal expansion characteristic of [dorsal] in its non-primary manifesta-
tion. Within the laryngeo-pharyngeal zone of articulation, the glottis, the pharynx, 
the tongue root or the tongue dorsum may be actively involved in constriction, 
depending on whether [guttural] appears in its primary or non-primary instantia-
tion, and depending on other place and stricture features of the segment. In Arabic, 
the realization of [guttural] is dependent on other place and stricture features of the 
segment to a far greater degree than the other place features. This is particularly 
the case where [guttural] appears in its non-primary instantiation. The [guttural] 
phonemes in Arabic include the laryngeals /h/ and /ʔ/, the pharyngeals // and /c/, 
the vowel /a/, and, with [guttural] as a non-primary feature, the uvulars /χ, ʁ, q/11 
and the pharyngealized coronals /, , , z, /.12 The pharyngeals are distinguished 
from the laryngeals by an additional non-primary [guttural] feature (see Section 
3.4.9). The phonetic interpretation of primary [guttural] is given below:
(28) The phonetic interpretation of primary [guttural]
 
1. A primary [guttural] stop is glottal (ʔ).
 
2. A primary [guttural] fricative is laryngeal (h).
 
3. A primary [guttural] vowel is pharyngeal (a).
Segments which lack an oral articulator ([labial], [coronal], or [dorsal]) lack 
the feature [cons] (see Section 3.1). The primary [guttural]s therefore share the 
absence of [cons], and are distinguished from one another by the stricture feature 
[cont] and the root feature [son]:
(29)  
h 
ʔ 
a
 
[cont] 
+ 
 
+
 
[son]

In Cairene and San’ani, as in Arabic generally, the glottal stop acts as the post-
lexical default consonant: this is the consonant which is inserted in the default case 
to provide an onset for an otherwise vowel-initial syllable (see Sections 4.4.1.2 
11 And the [dorsal] fricatives for dialects in which [dorsal] fricatives are phonologically post-velar.
12 Not all attested in the same dialect!

3.4 place/articulator features
39
and 9.1.2.3); it is also the consonant which is most commonly subject to elision in 
fast, casual speech (Watson 1989, 1991). The default status of the glottal stop is 
reﬂ ected in the matrix in (29) through lack of stricture and root features.
3.4.6 [Coronal]
The feature [coronal] describes a constriction produced by the tongue tip or blade; 
in its non-primary instantiation, [coronal] describes centralizing in vowels. In con-
trast to the features [labial], [dorsal], and [guttural], [coronal] interrupts the oral 
tract but involves no expansion or constriction of either the oral or the pharyngeal 
tracts.
Coronals constitute the largest group of sounds in the world’s languages (Keat-
ing 1991); therefore, if a purely articulator-only theory is to have trouble distin-
guishing all the phonemes in a language this will be most evident within the 
[coronal] group. In the majority of feature geometry models, the [coronal] artic-
ulator node has the dependent terminal nodes [anterior] and [distributed] (here 
described as phonetically grounded prime features). In many models, these term-
inal features are also bivalent. As I demonstrate here, the [coronal] phonemes in 
Cairene and San’ani can be distinguished by the phonetic interpretation of place 
features; however, certain [coronal] phonemes require the additional speciﬁ cation 
of a non-primary feature [dorsal]. The phonetic interpretation of primary [coronal] 
is given in (30).
(30) The phonetic interpretation of primary [coronal]
 
1. A primary [coronal] stop is dental–alveolar (t, d).
 
2. A primary [coronal] fricative is dental–alveolar (s, z).
 
3. A primary [coronal] vocoid is central (ɹ, ə).
In the vocoid series, [coronal] represents the lax vowel schwa ə and the approxi-
mant ɹ. Of these sounds, schwa is an optional unstressed allophone of any of the 
short vowel phonemes /i, u, a/ in San’ani and an optional unstressed allophone 
of the high vowels in Cairene. The other [coronal] vocoid, ɹ, plays no role in the 
phonological system of either dialect.
As it stands, the phonetic interpretation of primary [coronal] does not account 
for the interdental fricatives /	/ and /
/ and the palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate // in 
San’ani, nor for the palatoalveolar fricative /š/ attested in both San’ani and Cairene: 
a primary [coronal] fricative or stop is dental–alveolar. In a number of articulator-
plus accounts of the interdentals and palatoalveolars, [coronal] has an additional 
daughter node, [distributed] (e.g. Spencer 1984; Keating 1988, 1991). [Distrib-
uted] sounds are produced with a constriction ‘that extends a considerable dis-
tance parallel to the direction of the airﬂ ow’ (Kenstowicz 1994: 30), while sounds 
lacking [distributed] are produced with a constriction that extends for a short dis-
tance along the direction of the airﬂ ow. In such a model, the interdentals are dis-
tinguished from the palatoalveolars by [+anterior] (versus [−anterior]). I suggest 
that a [coronal]-only account can be maintained by accepting, in line with more 

phonological features
40
traditional accounts, that the interdentals and palatoalveolars are universally less 
basic sounds than the dental–alveolars, but by allowing this relative markedness to 
be represented by the non-primary feature [dorsal].13,14
If we return to the phonetic interpretation of primary [dorsal] in (23), we see 
that while a primary [dorsal] consonant is velar, a primary [dorsal] vocoid is pala-
tal. According to the Rank–Stricture Correspondence (9c), ‘The degree of con-
striction in the articulation realizing a non-primary place feature in a segment 
does not exceed the degree of constriction of the articulation of a primary place 
feature in the same segment’. A non-primary stricture therefore tends to be more 
vowel-like and to involve more movement than a primary stricture. Thus, while 
primary [dorsal] involves raising the dorsum to touch the velum in consonants, 
non-primary [dorsal] is interpreted broadly as pharyngeal expansion with no com-
mitment regarding the degree of stricture (cf. Section 3.4.10). In the unmarked 
case, pharyngeal expansion also involves dorsum raising. Pharyngeal expansion 
and dorsum raising in a primary [coronal] segment results in a palatoalveolar. 
We therefore represent the palatoalveolars as primary [coronal] and non-primary 
 [dorsal].
The interdentals have a more fronted tongue-body position than the dental–
alveolars (Smith 1988: 214). They exhibit the pharyngeal expansion character-
istic of the palatoalveolars, but not the dorsum raising.15 In common with the 
palatoalveolars, the interdentals involve a lengthened constriction. The similarity 
between the interdentals and the palatoalveolars is captured by shared basic place 
features—primary [coronal] and non-primary [dorsal]. The diﬀ erence between 
the two sets of sounds is represented by the diﬀ ering status of non-primary [dor-
sal]: secondary [dorsal] in the case of palatoalveolars, and tertiary [dorsal] in 
the case of the interdentals. The secondary–tertiary distinction is motivated by 
the fact that the interdentals exhibit a sub-set of the [dorsal] eﬀ ects (pharyngeal 
expansion and lengthened constriction), while the palatoalveolars exhibit the full 
set of [dorsal] eﬀ ects (pharyngeal expansion, dorsum raising, and lengthened con-
striction). As discussed above (see Section 3.4.1), the feature–node theory adopt-
ed here enables us to represent the interdentals with an empty secondary place 
node. The place-feature representations of the interdentals and the palatoalveolars 
are given in (31).
13 Several languages which have dental–alveolar /s/ lack palatoalveolar /š/, but it is rare for a lan-
guage to have /š/ without /s/ (cf. Kenstowicz 1994: 30; cf. Hall 1997: 91). In addition, just as palataliza-
tion of dental–alveolar /t/ and /d/ in some sociolects of Cairene results in aﬀ ricates [tš] and [] (Haeri 
1997), so /s/ in some dialects of northern Yemeni and Tunisian is realized as [š] in the environment of 
a [dorsal] vowel /i/.
14 Similar representations of the interdentals and palatoalveolars have been presented in diﬀ erent 
phonological frameworks: Smith (1988) captures the dental–alveolar distinction in a particle approach 
with an I [= coronal] head and an I [= fronting] dependent for the dentals: in Broadbent’s (1999) 
approach the interdentals are represented with A [= coronal] head, I [= palatality] dependent, but the 
palatoalveolars with A and I having equal status. An equal status representation of primary features 
is not possible in an articulator-only approach, however, since representations with dual primary place 
are ruled out by the No Dual Primary Place constraint (11).
15 However, they do exhibit tongue raising at the front of the vocal tract.

From this matrix, speciﬁ cation of [voice] can be removed from the [sonorant]s, since 
[sonorant]s are redundantly voiced (see (16) above). We can remove the speciﬁ ca-
tion [son] from the [nasal] phoneme, since [nasal]s are redundantly [son] (see Sec-
tion 3.1); similarly, we can remove the [son] speciﬁ cation for the [lateral] phoneme, 
since [lateral]s are redundantly [son]. The latter redundancy rule is set out in (34).

Cairene system, /z/, requires two non-place feature speciﬁ cations ([voice] and 
[strident]), whereas all other emphatics require one (// and // in Cairene, // in 
San’ani) or, in the case of the least marked emphatic (//), none.
Cairene has two marginal pharyngealized labials, /b/ and /m / (see Sections 2.1.1 
and 2.3). The pharyngealized labials are represented as primary [labial] and non-
primary [guttural]:

3.4.8 The representation of the uvulars
The uvular stop /q/ (and uvular fricatives for dialects in which [dorsal] fricatives 
are phonologically uvular) are distinguished from other [dorsal] sounds by speciﬁ -
cation for non-primary [guttural] in addition to primary [dorsal]. Thus, they are 
taken to be the emphatic counterparts of the dorsals. As we will see in Chapter 10, 
the uvular stop in Cairene has a similar phonetic eﬀ ect on adjacent vowels to the 
pharyngealized coronals, as shown in (42).17
16 Recall that the coronals form voiceless–voiced–emphatic triads in San’ani, in contrast to Cairene, 
and thus voice is non-distinctive in the San’ani emphatics.
17 Jakobson (1957) puts forward arguments for the uvular fricatives /χ/ and /ʁ/ to be considered 
the emphatic counterparts of the palatoalveolar fricatives /š/ and /ž/ in the Arabic dialect of the North 
Palestinian Druze. If we assume the palatoalveolar fricatives in this dialect have a non-primary [dorsal] 
feature, we could claim that in dialects in which they are attested, the uvular fricatives /χ/ and /ʁ/ are, 
at least in some way, the emphatic counterparts of the palatoalveolars.

An analysis of the pharyngeals as emphatic is not new: Jakobson recognizes // 
and /c/ in Arabic as essentially pharyngealized laryngeals and says that in some 
dialects of Arabic the phonetic aﬃ  nity of / c/ and /ʔ/ is reinforced by a glottal 
closure which accompanies at least the anlaut variant of / c/. He also argues that 
when emphatics lose the features generated in the mouth resonator, the phoneme 
becomes a mere pharyngeal. In this regard, he cites Panconcelli-Calzia (1916)

who states that the emphatic  in Aramaic is fairly regularly replaced by c (Jakob-
son 1957: 113). McCarthy produces a similar analysis of the sound change * 
to c in Aramaic, comparing Arabic ʔar with Aramaic ʔarac ‘earth’: the primary 
[coronal] articulator is lost and the secondary [pharyngeal] feature is promoted 
(McCarthy 1994: 220). If the pharyngeals are emphatic laryngeals a sound change 
from a pharyngealized coronal to a pharyngeal is to be expected, given that sounds 
lose their oral features when they debuccalize, but retain their non-oral features: in 
many varieties of Scots, the stops /p, t, k/ debuccalize to [ʔ] after a stressed vowel 
(with an optional intervening nasal or liquid), before an unstressed vowel, a syl-
labic nasal or a word boundary; in lexically restricted cases, the fricative /	/ debuc-
calizes to [h] (Lass 1984: 114–15). Lass represents debuccalization as the loss of 
the oral component and the retention of the laryngeal component:

3.4.10 The phonetic interpretation of non-primary [guttural]
In this model, pharyngealized and pharyngeal segments are analysed as sharing a 
non-primary feature [guttural], where non-primary [guttural] is interpreted broad-
18 There is a problem with the analysis of *q > /ʔ/ in metropolitan Arabic dialects such as Cairene. 
If *q is the emphatic counterpart of /k/, we would expect *q to debuccalize to /c/ rather than to /ʔ/. In 
no documented modern dialect of Arabic is /c/ the reﬂ ex of *q : *q either loses its non-primary articula-
tion and becomes a mere velar stop, or it loses its primary ([dorsal]) articulation and becomes a glottal 
stop. I assume here that the historical sound change *q > /ʔ/ which took place in Cairene and other 
metropolitan dialects is the result of debuccalization followed by promotion of the non-primary articu-
lation (as in Selkirk 1993). This is diagrammed in (i).

ly as pharyngeal constriction. Thus, pharyngealized coronals are represented as 
the emphatic counterparts of plain coronals, pharyngealized labials as the emphat-
ic counterparts of plain labials, uvulars as the emphatic counterparts of velars, and 
pharyngeals as the emphatic counterparts of laryngeals. However, the degree and 
position of pharyngeal constriction for each sub-set of segments is not identical: in 
the pharyngealized coronals and labials and the uvulars, pharyngeal constriction 
occurs in the upper pharynx; whereas in the pharyngeals, constriction takes place 
in the lower pharynx. Similarly, while spread from a pharyngeal results in vowel 
lowering, spread from a pharyngealized oral consonant tends to result in centraliza-
tion of [dorsal] vowels and both lowering and retraction of [guttural] vowels (Har-
rell 1957; Broselow 1976; Woidich 1999 for Cairene). As we will see in Chapter 
10, spread from a pharyngealized coronal may target the entire phonological word 
in both dialects, whereas spread from a pharyngeal (or uvular stop in Cairene) is 
restricted to adjacent vowels only.
The surface diﬀ erences in pharyngeal constriction between the pharyngealized 
oral consonants and the pharyngeals and the diﬀ erence in the extent of spread from 
these sounds are predictable from the principles of phonetic realization, however, 
and are due to the combinatorial eﬀ ect of the two places of articulation involved: 
with the pharyngealized coronals, primary [coronal] restrains the tongue dorsum 
to restrict the pharyngeal eﬀ ect of non-primary [guttural] at the same time as non-
primary [guttural] tends to retract the tongue tip from the dental region towards 
the alveolar ridge (Ali and Daniloﬀ  1974; McOmber 1996: 251–2; Zemánek 1996: 
4; cf. Harrell 1957: 71, n. 8); in the pharyngeals, the primary place is the larynx, 
and therefore the pharyngeal eﬀ ect of non-primary [guttural] is not moderated in 
the mouth. The non-primary constriction of the pharyngeals is consequently lower 
and closer to the larynx than that of the pharyngealized coronals or the uvulars. 
The combinatorial eﬀ ect of primary and non-primary [guttural] can be represented 
as the default rule in (49).

[constricted lower pharynx]
By attributing surface diﬀ erences in pharyngeal constriction to the primary rather 
than to the non-primary feature, I reach the same conclusion obtained by Hess for 
her factor analysis of X-ray tracings of pharyngeals, pharyngealized coronals and 
vowels and non-pharyngealized segments spoken by two speakers of Damascene 
Arabic and one speaker of Tunisian Arabic. Despite diﬀ erences in pharyngeal con-
striction between pharyngeals and pharyngealized coronals, she concludes that the 
same factor is responsible for the pharyngeal constriction, and ascribes surface 
diﬀ erences to ‘the inﬂ uence of the tongue blade in the pharyngealized segments’ 
(Hess 1990: 13, cited in McCarthy 1994: 202). This observation is in line with the 
Phonetic Interpretation of Place Features in (9), which states that the realization 
of a non-primary feature ‘may be independent of the other features of the segment 
containing it, or it may be contingent on the other place and/or stricture features 

3.4 place/articulator features
47
of the segment’. In contrast to [labial], which in its non-primary instantiation is 
realized in the default case as rounding irrespective of the identity of the primary 
feature,19 the diﬀ erent phonetic realizations of non-primary [guttural] result from 
the dependence of the feature on other place features and, in the case of primary 
[dorsal] segments, on stricture features of the segment.
3.4.11 The representation of the vowels
The three short vowels in Arabic, /a, i, u/, are distinguished from their correspond-
ing glides or non-syllabic counterparts, /h, ʔ, y, w/, by syllable position only. Vow-
els have the features [son], [cont], and [voice], of which [voice] is predictable from 
the speciﬁ cation [son], and [cont] is predictable from the combination of absence 
of [cons] and presence of [son]. Vowels are distinguished from one another by the 
place features [guttural], [dorsal], and [labial]. Of these, /a/ is distinguished by the 
feature [guttural], /i/ by the feature [dorsal] (with non-primary [dorsal] assigned 
by default, see (24)) and /u/ by the primary feature [dorsal] and the non-primary 
feature [labial]—see (50).

There are no primary [labial] vowels in the two dialects (in the vocoid set [labial]

[dorsal] can be removed from the matrix for /u/, since [dorsal] is predictable from 
the redundancy rule in (52).

citing data from Catford 1972: 679–81).

3.5 CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have outlined the feature geometry model assumed for the underly-
ing speciﬁ cation of the phonemes of Cairene and San’ani. Within the discussion, I 
have demonstrated that by allowing the phonetic interpretation of place features to 
take place, an abstract reductionist theory of the feature repertoire is suﬃ  cient to 
account for all the phonemes in the language. I argued that the well-documented 
[coronal] representation of palatal vocoids fails to fulﬁ l two of the basic criteria 
for phonological features,20 and that an articulatorily appropriate and necessary 
and suﬃ  cient representation of palatal vocoids can be achieved by maximizing the 
cover feature [dorsal]. The only vocoids represented by [coronal] are the central 
vocoids ɹ, ə, of which only schwa (ə) plays any role in the phonological system of 
the dialects discussed in this book. In the discussion of emphasis spread in Chap-
ter 10, it will be shown that phonetically non-primary [coronal] may have a central-

izing eﬀ ect on vowels. I also assume that monovalent features are both necessary 
and suﬃ  cient to account for all phonological processes in the language. In Chapter 
9 it will be shown that the apparent spread of negative feature-values in the antici-
patory devoicing of stops in Cairene and San’ani is due to the licensing of [voice] 
in obstruents if and only if followed by a sonorant: obstruents in coda position take 
their voicing value either from this condition, or from the anticipatory spread of 
[voice] from an adjacent voiced onset (see Sections 9.2.5–6).

SYLLABLE STRUCTURE AND SYLLABIFICATION
This chapter examines the syllable structure and syllabiﬁ cation of San’ani and 
Cairene. I begin by discussing the syllabic skeleton and present arguments in 
favour of moraic theory over X-slot (or onset–rhyme) theory. Within the consid-
eration of syllable structure, I discuss the analysis of apparent CVCCC syllables 
in San’ani in view of the fact that syllables in Arabic are commonly held to be 
maximally bimoraic. I support the proposal that syllables in Arabic are maximally 
bimoraic and claim that CVCCC syllables in San’ani can be properly analysed 
as marked variants of CVCC syllables: the only two consonants which occur in 
ﬁ nal position in CVCCC syllables, tš, are exceptionally linked to a single conso-
nant slot. Under syllabiﬁ cation, I consider four syllable-related processes in the 
dialects: epenthesis, glottal stop prosthesis, closed syllable shortening, and syn-
cope. While syllable-related processes are strictly structure-preserving in Cairene, 
in San’ani, closed syllable shortening and syncope are not always structure-pre-
serving: word-internal CVVC syllables are attested optionally in derived envir-
onments, and syllables with initial clusters of up to three consonants—many of 
which disobey the Sonority Sequencing Principle—arise as a result of syncope. I 
demonstrate, however, that syllables are maximally bimoraic at the postlexical as 
well as the lexical level in San’ani as in Cairene, and that word-internal CVVC 
syllables in San’ani arise from Adjunction-to-Mora by which a syllable-ﬁ nal mora 
comes to dominate two constituents, VC, exceptionally (Broselow 1992: 14). In 
the case of derived initial consonant clusters, I argue that syncope frequently 
deletes the vowel of a syllable, but not the mora. Where the initial consonant (the 
consonant to the left of the syncopated vowel) is more sonorous than the following 
consonant (the consonant to the right of the syncopated vowel), the freed-up mora 
reassociates with the initial consonant; where the initial consonant is less sonor-
ous than the following consonant, on the other hand, the mora is deleted together 
with the vowel. Thus, while only vowels are lexically stipulated as syllable peaks 
in San’ani, syllabic consonants arise post-lexically, particularly in word-initial 
 position.
4.1 ASSOCIATION AND THE SYLLABIC SKELETON
There are two current views of the syllabic skeleton in generative phonology—
X-slot, or onset-rhyme theory, and moraic theory. X-slot theory has developed 
from the original theory on the syllabic skeleton, CV theory (McCarthy 1979a,

4.1 association and the syllabic skeleton
51
1981; Halle and Vergnaud 1980), in which the skeleton was posited as a string 
of pre-speciﬁ ed syllabic and non-syllabic slots. In X-slot theory, the skeleton is 
deﬁ ned as a sequence of empty positions or slots labelled as X (Kaye and Lowen-
stamm 1984; Levin 1985). In all theories which acknowledge the existence of a syl-
labic skeleton, elements of the segmental (or melodic) tier associate with elements 
of the skeleton in accordance with the Universal Association Convention (UAC):
(1)
Universal Association Convention
 
 Associate autosegments and autosegment-bearing units one to one, left to 
right (cf. Goldsmith 1976; McCarthy 1982; Archangeli 1984a; Pulleyblank 
In the following CV and X-slot representations of the word bint ‘girl’ in Arabic, 
the UAC assures that /b/ associates with the leftmost skeletal position, /i/ with the 
second skeletal position, and so on:
Association between the melody and the syllabic skeleton is restricted by the Well-
formedness Principle, which bans the crossing of association lines (Goldsmith 
i
b
The Wellformedness Principle ensures that given four melodic elements, /bint/, 
and four skeletal positions, association results in [bint] and not *[tinb] or *[tibn]. 
In most grammars, association is also subject to the requirement that all templatic 
positions are matched with a melody (Goldsmith 1976; Farwaneh 1990: 120). 
This means that given two melodic units and three templatic positions, association 
takes place from left to right, one to one with the rightmost melodic unit spreading 
to associate with the unassociated templatic position. In the diagram in (4) and in 
subsequent diagrams, a solid line denotes an established link, while a broken line 
indicates a linking process in operation.
In the mid-1980s, Kaye and Lowenstamm (1984) and Levin (1985) proposed

replacing the CV skeleton by a sequence of empty positions labelled as Xs. The 
main motivation for the X-skeleton came from the observation that in some cases 
a skeletal position may associate with either a consonant or a vowel. A typical ex-
ample is provided by the deﬁ nite article in Tiberian Hebrew. The deﬁ nite article 
geminates a following non-guttural consonant, as in: ham-melek ‘the king’. If the 
following consonant is guttural, however, the vowel of the article lengthens, as in: 
haa-ciir ‘the city’. If the deﬁ nite article template includes an empty X-slot, it is 
free to link to any segment regardless of feature content. For lexical forms in which 
a distinction between consonantal and vocalic slots is crucial, such as the Arabic 
templates for form II and III verbs, CVCCVC and CVVCVC, the vocalic slots are 
interpreted as X-slots pre-associated to a nucleus:
Under X-slot theory, syllable peaks are associated with the nucleus (N) of the syl-
lable rhyme (R), and phonological weight is deﬁ ned in terms of the presence or 
absence of two skeletal positions in the rhyme of a syllable. In a CV syllable, the V 
element is associated with one position in the rhyme, the nucleus (N).
A heavy syllable, CVV or CVC, is associated with two positions in the rhyme. In 
a CVV syllable, the vocalic melody V associates with the leftmost nucleic X slot 
and spreads to the rightmost available X slot in accordance with the requirement 
that all templatic positions are matched with a melody—see (7).

CVV and CVC syllables are distinguished in that the second element of the CVV 
rhyme is associated with the nucleus (N) while the second element of the CVC 
rhyme is linked directly to the rhyme node (R). In languages such as Lardil and 
Cahuilla in which CVC syllables count as light while CVV syllables count as 
heavy, heavy syllables are deﬁ ned as those in which two skeletal positions are 
associated to the N node, as in:
Under moraic theory (Hyman 1985; Hayes 1989, 1995; Broselow 1995 and oth-
ers), the hierarchical structure of the X-slot skeleton has been dispensed with and 
only genuine prosodic positions, known as moras, are represented on the prosodic 
template: the only positions represented are those which in X-slot theory are asso-
ciated with the nucleus in languages for which CV and CVC syllables are light and 
CVV syllables heavy, and with the nucleus and rhyme in languages for which CV 
syllables are light and CVV and CVC syllables heavy.
In all models of moraic theory, short vowels are associated with a single mora 
while long vowels are associated with two moras, as in (9).

syllable structure and syllabification
54
In Hayes (1989) and others, long (geminate) consonants are distinguished from 
short consonants as underlyingly monomoraic versus underlyingly non-moraic. 
Under this account, the hypothetical forms ata and atta receive the derivations 
in (10).
 
Since single consonants are underlyingly weightless, they must be assigned a mora 
when they occupy the coda of a heavy syllable. This is achieved by the Weight-
by-Position condition which assigns a mora to a coda consonant in languages for 
which CVC syllables are prosodically heavy. The Weight-by-Position condition is 
restricted to a single application, ensuring that syllables in general will respect a 
bimoraic limit, as in (11).
The three principal aspects of Hayes’s (1989) version of moraic theory are summed 
up under Sources of Syllable Weight in (12) (cf. Piggott 1995: 284, 287):
(12) Sources of Syllable Weight
 
(a)  Short vowels contribute one mora and long vowels two moras (univer-
sal).
 
(b) Geminate consonants contribute one mora (universal).
 
(c)  Weight-by-Position: a ‘coda’ consonant is assigned a mora in the course 
of syllabiﬁ cation (parametric).
I adopt moraic theory in preference to X-slot theory for a number of reasons. First-
ly, X-slot theory gives equal status to every segment irrespective of weight, while 
moraic theory develops a prosodic conception of the syllable, giving status only 
to those segments which bear weight and are potentially stressable. Segments in 
the rhyme are potentially stressable and bear weight, while segments in the onset 
have been shown to have no eﬀ ect on stress assignment—a syllable with a com-
plex onset st- or str- is no heavier than a syllable with a simple onset s-. Secondly, 
moraic theory captures the fact that metrical stress templates group moras. A com-
mon stress pattern equates a single heavy syllable (H) with two successive light 
(L) syllables. (H) and (LL) constituents can be analysed as arising from a pro-

cedure which groups two successive moras irrespective of whether the moras fall 
in a single syllable or two successive syllables. By contrast, no prosodic process 
groups successive X-slots: (at), (aa)ta, (ta)ta and (tr)apa are prosodically inco-
herent (Kenstowicz 1994: 431). Thirdly, moraic theory provides an economical 
means of capturing phenomena such as compensatory lengthening (cf. Hayes 
1989): in the historical development of Cairene rƒs ‘head’ from Classical Arabic 
*raʔs, the pre-consonantal glottal stop is deleted; this frees up the right-hand mora 
into which the short vowel spreads, as in (13).
Under X-slot theory, by contrast, an additional operation is required: not only is 
the consonant deleted from the X slot, but X is disassociated from the rhyme node 
(R) and reassociated with the nucleus node (N), as in (14):
A potential problem does arise with moraic theory, however, in the treatment of 
diphthongs. In Arabic, diphthongs are represented as adjacent melodic units (/a + 
y/ or /a + w/) linked to adjacent moras and not as diphthongal units (/ai/ or /au/) 
linked to two moras. This is due to the fact that glides commute with sound conso-
nants in Arabic. Thus, kayf ‘how’ has the triliteral root /k-y-f/ just as karf ‘[type 
of cactus]’ has the triliteral root /k-r-f/. In X-slot theory, diphthongs have a status 
independent of both long vowels and vowel–consonant sequences by virtue of the 
intervening X-tier. In moraic theory, on the other hand, they are treated as identi-
cal to vowel–consonant sequences: there is no structural diﬀ erence between the 
sequences -arf and -ayf. The moraic representations of San’ani kƒf, kayf, and karf 
are given in (15).
Within the hierarchical representations of X-slot theory, by contrast, /y/ of /ay/ is 
treated as part of a branching nucleus—see (16).

syllable structure and syllabification

In X-slot theory, diphthong-shortening in San’ani, as exempliﬁ ed in (53)–(55) 
below, is represented as delinking of the second element of the diphthong from the 
nucleus node N with resyllabiﬁ cation attaching the adjacent unsyllabiﬁ ed conso-
nant directly to the R node. In moraic theory, however, there is no structural diﬀ er-
ence between kayf ‘how’ and karf ‘[type of cactus]’, therefore /y/ of the diphthong 
needs to be marked as subject to deletion in speciﬁ c environments, and diphthong-
shortening is by no means represented as a natural or predictable outcome.
4.2 SYLLABLE STRUCTURE
Most eastern Arabic dialects exhibit a fairly limited range of syllable types. Three 
basic syllables are attested in Cairene and San’ani: CV, CVV, and CVC. In both 
dialects, CV counts as a light syllable, while CVV and CVC count as heavy syl-
lables. CV does not occur in utterance-ﬁ nal position in San’ani, and, with very few 
exceptions,1 CVV does not occur in phonological word-ﬁ nal position in Cairene. 
That Cairene does not usually allow word-ﬁ nal CVV syllables is a result of the 
history of the dialect when long ﬁ nal vowels were reduced to short ﬁ nal vowels 
(Birkeland 1952: 25). In utterance-ﬁ nal position, laxing continues today in the dia-
lect: in utterance-ﬁ nal CV syllables where V is /i/, as exempliﬁ ed by katabti ‘you 
f.s. wrote’, mari ‘Egyptian’ and ardi ‘my parcel’, /i/ is often elided or reduced to 
schwa (Fischer 1969: 67).
The minimal syllable in the two dialects is monomoraic with an obligatory 
onset, as in (17).

1 In Cairene, long domain-ﬁ nal vowels are found in loan words, such as gat¥ ‘gateau’, and where 
the zero allomorph of the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x is attached to vowel-ﬁ nal 
forms, as in šaf¶  ‘they saw him’, maskƒ ‘holding f.s. it m.’. In the latter case, this is a result of pre-suﬃ  x 
vowel lengthening (see Section 8.1.1).

4.2 syllable structure
57
The maximal syllable in the two dialects is bimoraic: there is no weight distinc-
tion between CVV and CVC2 syllables since both are prosodically heavy in Arabic, 
but only vowels and geminate consonants are assigned moras lexically. Where syl-
lables are closed with a non-geminate consonant, the ﬁ nal consonant is assigned a 
mora through Weight-by-Position.
In domain-ﬁ nal position, CVC syllables are prosodically light in Cairene and 
San’ani. While a word-internal CVC syllable may be stressed in antepenultimate 
or penultimate position in San’ani and in penultimate position in Cairene, a word-
ﬁ nal CVC syllable fails to be assigned stress in either dialect:3 the word katab ‘he 
wrote’ is stressed on the initial light syllable .ka. and not on the ﬁ nal syllable .tab. 
In order to account for the fact that domain-ﬁ nal syllables usually require more ele-
ments to count as heavy than domain-internal syllables, a number of researchers 
(Liberman and Prince 1977; Prince 1983; Hayes 1979, 1995, for instance) propose 
that domain-ﬁ nal consonants are extrametrical in a number of languages (includ-
ing dialects of Arabic). Consonant extrametricality is represented notationally by 
placing the ﬁ nal consonant in angled brackets, as in (19).

2 There is no moraic constraint in either dialect (cf. Zec 1995: 115), but only vowels are lexically 
stipulated as syllable peaks. However, in San’ani, consonants can surface as syllable peaks:

The ﬁ nal consonant is syllabiﬁ ed in the ﬁ nal syllable at a later stage in the der-
ivation. However, its extrametrical status renders it invisible to the Weight-by-
 Position condition, and it fails to be assigned a mora. In both dialects, a word-ﬁ nal 
CVC syllable therefore counts as monomoraic and not as bimoraic.
4.3 SUPERHEAVY AND ‘SUPER-SUPERHEAVY’
SYLLABLE TYPES
In addition to the basic syllable types considered above, there is a third syllable 
type, a ‘superheavy’ syllable, which is usually restricted to domain-ﬁ nal position.

CVVC

 *** 
CVCCC
CVVC is usually restricted to phonological word-ﬁ nal position in San’ani and, 
with a few lexicalized exceptions from Standard Arabic, is always restricted to 
phonological-word-ﬁ nal position in Cairene; CVCC is restricted to phonological 
word-ﬁ nal position in San’ani and to utterance-ﬁ nal position in Cairene; and 
CVCCC is restricted to phonological word-ﬁ nal position in San’ani, but is not 
attested in Cairene.
Domain-ﬁ nal consonants in superheavy syllables are prosodically licensed, not 
as extrametrical, but as extrasyllabic. In contrast to an extrametrical consonant 
which links directly to the syllable node of the ﬁ nal syllable, an extrasyllabic con-
sonant is not incorporated into the adjacent syllable at any stage in the derivation 
(Aoun 1979: 140; Selkirk 1981;4 Hayes 1979: 78; Kenstowicz 1994: 274; Kager 
1995: 376).
An apparent problem arises with the analysis of San’ani ﬁ nal CVCCC syllables. 
If we claim that only the ﬁ nal consonant in the domain is extrasyllabic we end up 
with an apparent trimoraic syllable, as in (22).
4 However, CVVC and CVCC syllables are not prosodically identical (Watson 1999c). Selkirk 
(1981) accounts for this prosodic disparity in an analysis whereby CVCC is analysed as a canonical 
syllable plus a degenerate syllable (CVC)(C), but CVVC is analysed as a single superheavy syllable. 
The prosodic distinction between CVVC and CVCC syllables is discussed in detail in Section 5.4.1.

4.3 superheavy syllable types
59
The CVCCC syllable type is, however, extremely restricted in occurrence, and 
almost all potential sequences of CVCCC (including CVVCC) are avoided in the 
dialect. Where the morphology concatenates a word ending in CVVC with the 
Section 4.4.1.3).5
(23) /mƒ + kƒn + š/ 
mƒ kƒnš ~ kanš 
‘he was not’
 
/mƒ + yik¶n + š/ 
ma yk¶nš ~ ykunš 
‘he is not’
Where the morphology concatenates a feminine plural morpheme, -ayn, with a 
consonant-initial suﬃ  x, the diphthong is shortened and simpliﬁ ed to give CanC:
(24) /mƒ + gƒlayn + š/ 
mƒ gƒlanš ‘they f. didn’t say’
 
/mƒ + tištayn + š/ 
mƒ tištanš 
‘you f.pl. don’t want’
 
/mƒ + antayn + š/ 
ma ntanš 
‘you f.pl. are not’
And where the morphology concatenates a word ending in a geminate consonant, 
CVGG, with the negative suﬃ  x, the geminate consonant is degeminated (see Sec-
tion 8.1.6) to give a CVCC structure, as in (25).
(25) /mƒ + yiibb + š/ 
ma yibš 
‘he doesn’t like’
 
/mƒ + bi-nihtamm + š/ 
mƒ bi-nihtamš 
‘we don’t care’
 
/mƒ + add + š/ 
mƒ adš 
‘no one’
CVCCC syllables are restricted, therefore, not only in terms of phonological pos-
ition, but also in terms of which consonants can occupy the ﬁ nal two positions. 
The only surface tokens of ﬁ nal CVCCC syllables in San’ani6 involve ﬁ nal tš from 
the concatenation of the perfect aspect subject suﬃ  xes {ﬁ rst person singular} or 
{second person masculine singular} + {negative}:
(26) /mƒ + libist + š/ 
mƒ libistš 
‘I/you m.s. didn’t wear’
 
/mƒ + gult + š/ 
mƒ gultš 
‘I/you m.s. didn’t say’
We have two options: either we say that syllables are maximally bimoraic in 
San’ani unless either of the subject suﬃ  xes {ﬁ rst person singular} or {second per-
son masculine singular} is concatenated with the negative suﬃ  x, in which case the 
maximal syllable is trimoraic; or we mark ﬁ nal tš as special in some way. I propose

that ﬁ nal tš is analysed as an aﬀ ricate. That is to say, although tš is derived from 
two diﬀ erent morphemes, on the surface it counts as a single consonant in San’ani 
and probably in other dialects of Arabic for which CVCCC syllables are attested. 
This analysis allows us to admit no more than a single extrasyllabic position and 
to admit the coronal aﬀ ricate as a marked option in this position (cf. Wiese 1996: 
48 for a similar analysis of tš in German). Thus, (mƒ) kuntš ‘I/you m.s. was/were 
not’ is represented as in (27).
The development of syllable-ﬁ nal tš in San’ani mirrors that of word-initial ts, tz, t, 
tš, and tj in form V and VI triliteral and form I I quadriliteral verbs. The detransitiv-
izing preﬁ x (see Section 6.5.4) produces syllable-initial clusters with the sibilants 
far more readily than with other consonants—see (28).

‘to cough’

‘to wear the širšaf ’
 
tzawwaj 
‘to get married’
 
tƒfa 
‘to hit each other in jest’
 
tjƒbar 
‘to converse’
With few exceptions, when the initial stem consonant is not a sibilant the detrans-
itivizing preﬁ x is realized as ta- before a guttural and ti- elsewhere (see Section 
6.5.4). The examples in (28) compare with those in (29).
(29) taƒkƒ 
‘to talk’
 
ta caššƒ 
‘to have supper’
 
timašgar ‘to wear ﬂ owers in one’s hair’
 
tigabbab ‘to become bitter’
Evidence for the analysis of tš as an aﬀ ricate at some level in the phonology 
is adduced from the pronunciation of loan words. It is well known that when 
loan words are adopted into a language they are adapted to the phonological sys-
tem of the borrower language. The word ‘television’ is adapted into San’ani as 
tiliviziy¶n with -ziy- replacing the voiced palatoalveolar fricative of the source lan-
guage. Here we see that the English word ‘sandwich’ is adapted into San’ani as 
sandaw¤tš,7 with the unsyllabiﬁ ed /d/ triggering epenthesis to conform to San’ani 
word-internal syllable structure and the ﬁ nal syllable attracting word stress. Inter-
estingly for the argument at hand, /i/ of the ﬁ nal syllable is lengthened to produce 
a phonological-word-ﬁ nal CVVCC syllable. The lengthening of the vowel can be 
explained if tš is felt to constitute a single consonant (the voiceless equivalent of

the voiced palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate /j/) at some level in the phonology. In this case, 
a ﬁ nal unlengthened syllable -witš would have the syllable structure CVC, which 
would normally fail to attract word stress. To enhance the prominence of the ﬁ nal 
syllable, word-ﬁ nal vowel lengthening is invoked to produce a superheavy syllable 
CVVC—see (30).
Further evidence for the analysis of tš as a single consonant is seen in the pronun-
ciation of the loan words ‘jug’ as either jƒg or tšƒg and ‘jelly’ as either j¤l¤ or 
as tš¤l¤. Furthermore, utterance-ﬁ nal devoicing and geminate devoicing of voiced 
obstruents produces [tš] as a voiceless allophone of the palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate /j/, 
as in (31).
(31) /ranj/ 
ran[tš] ‘paint’
 
/ajj/

In contrast to San’ani, whenever VCt + š potentially arises in Cairene, the sequence 
t + š is broken up by epenthesis, as in (32).
(32) 
/ma + kunt + š/ 
ma kunt[i]š 
‘I/you m.s. was/were not’
For Cairene and other dialects of Arabic for which syllable-ﬁ nal Ctš is not attested, 
tš is not analysed as an aﬀ ricate at any level in the phonology.
4.4 SYLLABIFICATION
The main domain of syllabiﬁ cation is the phonological phrase in Cairene (however, 
cf. Section 4.4.1.1) and the phonological word in San’ani. The phonological word 
in both dialects consists of the word stem (cf. Section 6.4.2) plus any aﬃ  xes. In 
the imperfect verb, the phonological word comprises the stem, any subject and 
object pronoun suﬃ  xes, the negative suﬃ  x and the imperfect preﬁ x. A number 
of monomoraic particles including conjunctions and the habitual/continuous and 
future verbal preﬁ xes may be procliticized to the phonological word, and have no 
eﬀ ect on word stress. San’ani fa-bi-tiktub¶hƒ ‘so you m.pl. are writing it f.’ con-
sists of the phonological word tiktub¶hƒ and the proclitics fa- (conjunction) and bi- 
(habitual/continuous). Cairene wi-katab ‘and he wrote’ consists of the phonologic-
al word katab ‘he wrote’ and the proclitic wi- (conjunction). Usually the phono-
logical word is isomorphic with the syntactic word, but this is not always the case. 
In both dialects, the deﬁ nite article (il- in Cairene, al- in San’ani) forms a syntactic 
unit with the following noun or adjective, but is phonologically encliticized to the 
preceding phonological word—see (33).

syllable structure and syllabification

In Cairene, prepositional phrases which complement a verb are invariably incorp-
orated into the phonological word of the verb when they take a pronominal suﬃ  x. 
This is seen most clearly when the verb is negated by the discontinuous morpheme 
ma + š (Abdel-Massih 1975: 151, 152):
(34) 
/ma + katab + lak + š/ 
ma katablakš 
‘ he did not write to you 
m.s.’
 
/ma + katab + lina + š/ 
ma katablinƒš 8 
‘he did not write to us’
 
/ma + katab + ha + lina + š/ ma katabhalnƒš 9 ‘ he did not write it f. to 
me’
In San’ani, by contrast, a prepositional phrase complement can either be incorp-
orated within the phonological word of the verb or function as a separate phono-
logical unit:10
(35) (a) /mƒ + katab + lanƒ + š/ 
mƒ katablanƒš 
‘he did not write to us’
 
or /mƒ + katab + š + lanƒ/ 
mƒ katabš lanƒ 
‘he did not write to us’
 
(b) /mƒ + katab + lak + š/ 
mƒ katablakš 
‘ he did not write to you  
m.s.’
 
or /mƒ + katab + š + lak/ 
mƒ katabš lak 
‘ he did not write to you 
m.s.’
The phonological phrase forms the main domain of syllabiﬁ cation in Cairene, and 
is generally isomorphic with the syntactic phrase and includes genitive structures, 
noun phrases, verb phrases, and participle phrases. In these cases, main stress is 
placed on the second element of the phrase, and syllable repair processes take 
place where necessary to produce a fully syllabiﬁ able string. Consider the follow-
ing examples of syllabiﬁ ed phonological phrases together with a note of the proc-
ess required for exhaustive syllabiﬁ cation (dots delineate syllable boundaries):

299):
(37) (a) Consonant extrametricality: C >  〈C〉 /___]word.
 
(b) Associate moraic segments to a syllable node.
 
(c)  Given P (an unsyllabiﬁ ed segment) preceding Q (a syllabiﬁ ed segment), 
adjoin P to the syllable containing Q iﬀ  P has a lower sonority rank than 
Q (iterative).
 
(d)  Given Q (a syllabiﬁ ed segment) followed by R (an unsyllabiﬁ ed seg-
ment), assign a mora to R (Weight-by-Position) [iﬀ  R has a lower sonor-
ity rank than Q (iterative)].
 
(e) Adjoin moraic R to the syllable containing Q (iterative).
The algorithm in (37) is exempliﬁ ed in the syllabiﬁ cation of Cairene dardim ‘he 
ﬁ lled up’, given in (38).

4.4.1 Syllable repair processes
Where the morphology concatenates a sequence which cannot be syllabiﬁ ed 
exhaustively according to the syllabiﬁ cation algorithm, one of three repair proc-
esses may be invoked: epenthesis of a vowel, prosthesis of a consonant, or closed 
syllable shortening. I shall consider these processes in order.
4.4.1.1 Epenthesis
Sequences of three consonants are anathema in Cairene (Broselow 1976: 1). When-
ever three consonants are potentially juxtaposed within the utterance, epenthesis 
of [i] occurs between the second and third consonant. Within the word, but not 
across word boundaries, the epenthetic vowel is realized as [u] to the left of /u/.
(39) /ʔult + lak/ 
ʔult  [i]lak 
‘I told you m.s.’
 
/kull + hum/ 
kull  [u]hum 
‘all of them’
 
/šacb + sur¤ya/ 
šacb [i] sur¤ya ‘the people of Syria’
 
/kunt + hina/ 
kunt  [i] hina 
‘I/you m.s. was/were here’
 
/bint + la¤fa/ 
bint [i] la¤fa 
‘Latifa’s daughter’
While sequences of three consonants may occur in fast, connected speech in 
San’ani, in general epenthesis of [a] occurs when three consonants are juxtaposed 
within the phonological word, as in (40).
(40) /ajj + nƒ/ 
ajj [a]nƒ 
‘our pilgrim m.’
 
/ba cd + mƒ/ 
bacd [a]mƒ 
‘after’
 
/gabl + mƒ/ 
gabl[a]mƒ 
‘before’
 
/gult + lih/ 
gult[a]lih 
‘I told him’
 
/dafact + lak/ dafa ct [a]lak ‘I paid you m.s.’
In careful speech, epenthesis also occurs across phonological word boundaries but 
within the phonological phrase (usually within a genitive structure or between two 
identical nouns) in San’ani when the initial word ends in a geminate consonant or 
in two consonants which share a primary place of articulation, and the following 
word is consonant initial.
(41) 
/ahamm + šay/ 
ahamm[a] šay ‘the most important thing’
 
/lƒ + tigill + can/ 
lƒ tigill [a] can 
‘it f. is not less than’
 
/šigg + šigg/ 
šigg[a] šigg 
‘side-by-side’
 
/jamb + jamb/ 
jamb [a] jamb 
‘side-by-side’
 
/was + bayt/ 
was[a] bayt 
‘in the middle of a house’
Epenthesis also occurs within the phonological phrase when the initial word ends 
in two consonants which violate the sonority hierarchy, and the following word is 
consonant initial.

4.4 syllabification
65
(42) 
/bi-šakl + cƒmm/ 
bi-šakl[a] cƒmm ‘in general’
 
/ibn + man/ 
ibn[a] man 
‘whose son’
 
/xidr + badaw¤/ 
xidr[a] badaw¤ 
‘a bedouin abode’
In both dialects, the epenthetic vowel is inserted to the right of a stray consonant C¹:
(43) (a) Cairene: 0 → [i] / CC¹___C
 
(b) San’ani: 0 → [a] / CC¹___C
Epenthesis is represented as the projection of a mora to the right of an unsyllabiﬁ ed 
consonant. Consider here the derivation of San’ani gultalih ‘I/you m.s. told him’ 
in (44).
4.4.1.2 Consonant prosthesis
All syllables in Arabic require an onset. The majority of morphemes which may 
occur in utterance-initial position have an underlying initial consonant, and hence 
abide by this requirement. However, there are a few common vowel-initial mor-
phemes in both Cairene and San’ani which may occur in utterance-initial position.

These include the deﬁ nite article (il- in Cairene, al- in San’ani), the relative pro-
noun (illi in Cairene, alla¤ ~ all¤ ~ ill¤ in San’ani), ﬁ rst- and second-person inde-
pendent pronouns (e.g. anƒ ‘I’, ant ‘you m.s.’ in San’ani) and several loan words 
such as iksibr¢s ‘express’. Where these morphemes occur in utterance-initial pos-
ition, the requirement for a syllable to take an onset is met through prosthesis of 
the minimal consonant, a glottal stop (cf. also Section 9.1.2.3).11 Glottal stop pros-
thesis is represented in (45).
4.4.1.3 Closed syllable shortening
In Cairene, when the morphology concatenates a domain-ﬁ nal CVVC syllable 
to a consonant-initial morpheme within the phonological phrase, the long vowel 
is shortened to prevent the appearance of non-phonological-phrase-ﬁ nal CVVC 
syllables. In closed syllables, /ƒ/ is shortened to [a], /¢/ and /¤/ are shortened to 
[i], and /¥/ and /¶/ are shortened to [u]. Example (46a) exempliﬁ es vowel shorten-
ing within the phonological word; (46b) exempliﬁ es vowel shortening within the 
phonological phrase:
(46) (a) /bƒb + kum/ 
babkum 
‘your pl. door’
 
 
/f¢n + ha/ 
ﬁ nha 
‘where is she?’
 
 
/y¥m + ha/ 
yumha 
‘her day’
 
(b) /šƒf + muna/ 
šaf muna 
‘he saw Muna’
 
 
/ma-n¤š + cƒrif/ ma-niš cƒrif ‘I don’t know’
 
 
/ﬁ  b¤r + aw¤t/ ﬁ  bir aw¤t 
‘in a deep well’
This process is described as Closed Syllable Shortening (CSS) and can be under-
stood as the ﬁ nal (once extrasyllabic) consonant crowding out the vowel from the 
second mora to escape Stray Erasure (Kenstowicz 1994: 297). Morpheme-ﬁ nal 
consonants are extrasyllabic. When a consonant-initial element follows, the ﬁ nal 
consonant is no longer licensed as extrasyllabic and maps onto the second mora 
from which the vowel melody is delinked (Broselow 1992: 17):

4.4 syllabification
67
In both Cairene and San’ani, CSS took place historically within the phonological 
word between the stem of verbs of the form CVVC (known as hollow verbs) 
and consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes (see Section 6.5.6.3),12 as exempliﬁ ed in 
(48a)–(48b) for Cairene and (48c)–(48d) for San’ani.

In San’ani, as in Cairene, CSS also occurs between verbs and prepositional com-
plements.

‘he went oﬀ ’
 
/gƒl + l¤/

CSS takes place in San’ani between initial particles of the structure CVV and 
words with initial consonant clusters (usually resulting from syncope, see Section 
4.4.2.2)—see (51).
12 Historically, there are rather complex morpholexical rules of vowel alternation (for example, a ~ 
i) (cf. also Abu-Mansour 1992: 57).

CSS also takes place in San’ani in the {third person masculine singular} inﬂ ec-
tional form of hollow linking verbs when they are followed by a main verb. CSS 
in this case has the eﬀ ect of reducing the prosodic status of the linking verb to that 
of a clitic.

gam ralih 
‘he got up and went’
 
/gƒm + yi  csablahƒ/

a present]’
Diphthong simpliﬁ cation occurs in similar contexts to CSS in San’ani, and can be 
considered an instance of CSS: when a feminine plural suﬃ  x -ayn takes the nega-
tive suﬃ  x -š, the diphthong is reduced to [a], as in (24), repeated here as (53) for 
convenience.
(53) 
/mƒ + gƒlayn + š/ 
mƒ gƒlanš 
‘they f. didn’t say
 
/mƒ + tištayn + š/ 
mƒ tištanš 
‘you f.pl. don’t want’
 
/mƒ + antayn + š/ 
mantanš 
‘you f.pl. are not’
In a restricted number of particles of the structure CayC, the diphthong is simpli-
ﬁ ed to [a] in rapid speech, and the particle is reduced to the status of a clitic. In (54), 
the diphthong in the question particles ayn ‘where’ and kayf ‘how’ is simpliﬁ ed to 
[a], and the question word cliticized to the following consonant-initial word.
(54) 
/ayn + gadak/ 
an gadak 
‘where are you m.s.?’
 
/w-ayn + cƒdak/ 
wan cƒdak 
‘and where are you m.s. still?’
 
/alƒ + ayn + sƒrat/ 
alan sƒrat 
‘where did she go?’
 
/kayf + kƒn/ 
kaf kƒn 
‘how was it m.?’
In the same way, the diphthong of the verbal feminine plural subject suﬃ  x is often 
simpliﬁ ed to [a] in prosodically minimal linking verbs. The resulting subminimal 
structure is cliticized to a following verb, as in (55).
(55) 
/jayn + nitwƒlah/ 
jan nitwƒlah 
‘come f.pl., let’s have fun!’
 
/jayn + yijlisayn/

In contrast to Cairene, CSS and diphthong shortening fail to apply in San’ani 
between verbs and object suﬃ  xes or between nouns and possessive suﬃ  xes. At 
this level, when the object or possessive suﬃ  x has initial /h/ or /n/ there are two 
options: either the once domain-ﬁ nal C¹ in CVVC¹ induces epenthesis to produce a 
CVVCvC(V) sequence; or, and more commonly, C¹ fails to induce epenthesis and 
a phonological-word-internal CVVC syllable is attested.13 Compare the paired ex-
amples given in (57).

As in the case of domain-ﬁ nal CVCCC syllables discussed in Section 4.3. we could 
claim that syllables are normally maximally bimoraic, but that trimoraic CVVC 
syllables are optional in restricted circumstances. Part of the answer lies in a pro-
sodic diﬀ erence between CVCC and CVVC syllables which will be discussed in 
more detail in the next chapter (Section 5.4.1). Here I follow Broselow (1992) and 
Broselow et al. (1995, 1997) in assuming that surface word-internal CVVC syl-
lables in dialects including Iraqi, Sudanese, and Lebanese (Aoun 1979: 145) are in 
fact bimoraic and are derived from an adjunction rule that creates moras dominat-
ing two segments (Broselow 1992: 14–15):
Adjunction-to-Mora occurs optionally in San’ani to produce CVVC syllables for 
reasons relating to sonority since ‘subsyllabic constituents whose elements are 
widely separated on the sonority scale are less marked than constituents with clos-
er sonority distance’ (Broselow 1992: 15); therefore, while a syllable-ﬁ nal mora 
may dominate two constituents, VC, exceptionally because of the greater sonor-
13 Recall, also, the optional occurrence of utterance-ﬁ nal CVVCC syllables, for example, mƒ kƒnš 
as an alternant for mƒ kanš ‘he was not’ discussed above.

ity distance between V and C, it is unlikely that a single mora could dominate 
two identical constituents CC (or, indeed, VV). Adjunction-to-Mora thus accounts 
for the marked occurrence of word-internal CVVC syllables beside the non-occur-
rence of word-internal CVCC (or CVVV) syllables.14 Where a language existed 
which allowed Adjunction-to-Mora to create a CC mora, we predict that it would 
also permit Adjunction to create the less marked VC mora (Broselow 1992: 15).
4.4.2 Syncope
Syncope is not strictly required as a repair process, but is usually invoked to reduce 
the number of monomoraic syllables in the utterance and maximize the number of 
optimal bimoraic syllables. In both Cairene and San’ani, syncope of short vowels 
occurs, but in Cairene the vowel aﬀ ected is almost invariably high, /i/ or /u/,15 and 
syncope is blocked if the resulting structure would create an impermissible syl-
lable (Broselow 1992). In San’ani, by contrast, any of the short vowels /a/, /i/, or 
/u/ may be subject to syncope, syncope is not limited to vowels in monomoraic 
syllables particularly in post-pause position, and the output of syncope frequently 
produces structure-violating initial consonant clusters.
4.4.2.1 Syncope in Cairene
In Cairene, syncope of unstressed, high vowels in non-ﬁ nal monomoraic syllables 
occurs within the utterance whenever the output does not violate structure pres-
ervation. That is to say, /i/ is deleted from a monomoraic syllable if and only if 
ﬂ anked by vowel-ﬁ nal syllables—namely, CV(V)CiCV(V). Thus, /i/ in risƒla ‘let-
ter’ and kib¤r ‘big’ is subject to syncope after li and . . . di in the following phrases, 
and the mora of the syncopated vowel is assigned to the /r/ of r(i)sƒla ‘letter’ and 
the /k/ of k(i)b¤r ‘big’, respectively, as in (60).
(60) 
kƒn yiktib li rsƒla ‘he was writing me a letter’
 
ardi kb¤r 
‘my parcel is big’
The form ardi kb¤r ‘my parcel is big’ is derived from /ardi kib¤r/, as in (61).
However, /i/ in risƒla is not subject to syncope after yiktib ‘he writes’ because this 
would create an impermissible initial consonant cluster, rs—see (62).

14 The few lexicalized examples of CVVC syllables in Cairene in loans from Standard Arabic of 
the form CVVG such as mud¤r cƒmm ‘general manager’ and ʔalam gƒff ‘a dry pen’ are also analysed as 
Adjunction-to-Mora.
15 By contrast, except in the environment CVVCaCV (67), /a/ remains stable and is not subject to 
syncope (Fischer 1969: 67), as in: ardi aw¤l ‘a long parcel’ and inta katabt ‘you m.s. wrote’.

71
(62) 
kƒn yiktib risƒla ‘he was writing a letter’
In the same way, syncope of /i/ in kib¤r does not occur after agar ‘stone’, because 
the syllable to its left is consonant ﬁ nal and syncope would result in an impermis-
sible initial consonant cluster, kb:
(63) 
agar kib¤r  ‘a big stone’
Syncope is sensitive to stress factors and fails to target stressed high vowels: while 
unstressed /i/ in ši*ribt is syncopated after a vowel-ﬁ nal word, stressed /i/ is not 
syncopated in *širib in the same environment. Syncope in ana š*ribt ‘I drank’ con-
trasts with lack of syncope in huwwa *širib ‘he drank’ (Broselow 1976: 4).
Syncope often occurs after, and in consequence of, epenthesis, as in (64).
(64) 
/bint + kib¤ra/ 
bint[i] kb¤ra 
‘a big girl’
 
/ubb + kit¤r/ 
ubb[i] kt¤r 
‘a lot of love’
 
/bint + wi-walad/ 
bint[i] w-walad ‘a girl and a boy’
The interaction of epenthesis and syncope is illustrated in the derivation of binti 
kb¤ra ‘a big girl’ in (65).
Syncope also occurs within the phonological word when vowel-initial suﬃ  xes are 
added:
(66) 
/wiiš + a/ 
wiša 
‘bad f.’
 
/xulu + it/ 
xulit

maska 
‘taking hold f.’
 
/rƒgil + ¢n/ 
ragl¢n 
‘two men’
 
/sƒﬁ r + u/

‘they travelled’
Syncope is not entirely restricted to high vowels in Cairene. In the environment 
CVVCaCV, /a/ is subject to syncope and the long vowel shortens (Woidich 1999:

48). Form III verbal nouns of the pattern mVCaaCaCa in Standard Arabic and 
other dialects are realized as mVCaCCa in Cairene via the same process (see Sec-

‘reproach, rebuke’
Broselow (1992) argues that the strong preference of dialects for bimoraic syl-
lables underlies a number of phonological processes in Arabic, including syncope. 
The preference for bimoraic syllables is expressed in terms of the Bimoraicity Con-
straint.
(68) Bimoraicity Constraint
 
Syllables are maximally and optimally bimoraic (Broselow 1992: 10).
Broselow assumes that syncope applies blindly in all Arabic dialect types to 
destroy vulnerable monomoraic syllables (Broselow 1992: 35), and that structure 
is then restored where necessary by ‘structure-restoring’ epenthesis (Broselow 
1992: 36–7). This appears to be the correct analysis for Cairene and the other 
dialects Broselow examines (Iraqi, Sudanese, Makkan, and Syrian), but it cannot 
account for dialects in which syncope is partially lexical, where syncope is option-
al and restricted to a certain portion of the phonological word, and where syncope 
applies within unstressed bimoraic syllables as well as in monomoraic syllables—
this is what we ﬁ nd in San’ani.
4.4.2.2 Syncope in San’ani
In San’ani, as in Cairene, syncope targets vowels in monomoraic syllables which 
are ﬂ anked by vowel-ﬁ nal syllables across words to reduce the number of syllables 
and maximize bimoraicity (cf. Section 4.4.2.1). In contrast to Cairene, however, 
any of the short vowels may be syncopated, as in the examples in (69).
(69) 
/tišt¤ + tis¤r/ 
tišti ts¤r 
‘she wants to go’
 
/gad¶ + kubur/ 
gadu kbur 
‘he has grown up’
 
/cƒd¤ + rajamat/ 
cƒdi rjamat ‘she has just thrown’
Syncope also aﬀ ects monomoraic syllables within the clitic group when vowel-
ﬁ nal proclitics are aﬃ  xed:
(70) 
/  ca + yisƒﬁ r/ 
ca-ysƒﬁ r 
‘he will travel’
 
ca + tik¶n/ 
ca-tk¶n 
‘she will be’
 
/bi + nigarr¤/ 
bi-ngarr¤ 
‘we teach’
 
/mƒ + rajamathƒ + š/ ma rjamathƒš ‘she didn’t throw it f.’
However, syncope in San’ani not only reduces the number of monomoraic syl-
lables to maximize bimoraicity, it also targets vowels at the beginning of the 

4.4 syllabification
73
phonological word to produce apparently structure-violating clusters of up to three 
consonants in syllable-onset position. Moreover, syncope in San’ani does not tend 
to target unstressed vowels at the end of the phonological word.
In contrast to Cairene, word stress in San’ani is subject to signiﬁ cant ﬂ uctuation 
in connected speech (see Section 5.4.4). Disyllabic words of the structure CVC-
CVC and CVCVC and form VII and VIII verbs (of the structure (CV)CCVCVC) 
are regularly aﬀ ected by stress ﬂ uctuation, with the ﬁ nal CVC syllable frequently 
attracting stress in utterance-ﬁ nal position. The words in (71) can be stressed on 
either the leftmost or the following syllable, with optional syncope of the vowel of 
the leftmost syllable when the following syllable is stressed.

In addition, lexical syncope takes place optionally in plural and second feminine 
singular inﬂ ections of medial geminate (form II) verbs (see Section 6.5). Syncope 
is accompanied by degemination of the medial consonant—see (73).16

16 Recall that within the phonological word and in phonological-word-ﬁ nal position, geminates are 
maintained in San’ani, and usually induce epenthesis, as in: /kull + nƒ/ > kullanƒ ‘all of us’, /agg + 
šayx/ > agg[a] šayx ‘belonging to a shaykh’.

Syncope in medial geminate verbs is represented notionally as deletion of the node 
of the penultimate monomoraic syllable when the onset of that syllable shares the 
same consonant as the mora of the preceding syllable. The form al  c¶ ‘they m. took 
(something) up’ is derived as in (74).
In fast speech, when the ﬁ rst consonant of the verbal stem is a sibilant, syncope 
often targets the vowel of the following bimoraic syllable; therefore syncope is not 
restricted to the ﬁ nal syllable of the stem; compare (75).

If syncope were to apply blindly in San’ani to maximize bimoraicity it would not 
be possible to predict where ‘structure-restoring’ epenthesis would occur, particu-
larly since syncope is not restricted to vowels in monomoraic syllables (see šikmih 
> škmih, yišakkim¶ > yiškm¶, and tištay > tštay above).
4.4.2.3 Consonant clusters and the Sonority Sequencing Principle
According to the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP), the sonority proﬁ le of 
 preferred syllable types rises maximally at the beginning and drops minimally at 
the end. Initial consonant clusters resulting from syncope in San’ani can be divided 
into those which obey the Sonority Sequencing Principle: Occlusive < Fricative < 
Nasal < Liquid < Glide (Clements 1990: 290), and those which ﬂ out it, as in (76):

Sequences which ﬂ out the SSP in San’ani include sonority ‘plateaus’ Fr = Fr, and 
O = O, and sonority ‘reversals’ N > Fr, and L > N. Sequences which ﬂ out the SSP 
result partially from the type of initial consonants available in the derivational 
and inﬂ ectional morphology. Nasal /m/ to derive participles from verbs, and glide 
/y/, nasal /n/ and occlusive /t/ in the verbal inﬂ ectional morphology, and partially 
from the prevalence of coronal consonants (/y, n, s, š, t, z/) in the phonology, thus 
increasing the likelihood of initial coronals in consonant clusters (cf. Clements 
1990; cf. Yip 199117).
In a sample of ﬁ ve hours and thirty minutes of unrehearsed personal narrative 
and descriptive recordings from a single speaker of San’ani, I came across 120 
instances of syllable-initial consonant clusters resulting from syncope. Within 
these, I found the hierarchy of preference in initial clusters given in (77). In the left-
hand column, I have recorded the order of consonant types; in the middle column, 
the number of occurrences of the cluster type; in the right-hand column I have writ-
ten the abbreviations So (obey sonority hierarchy), R (sonority reversal), and P 
(sonority plateau).

17 According to Yip (1991), consonant clusters may have at most one place of articulation. This 
explains the special status of geminate consonants and the high number of cases of clusters involving at 
least one coronal or laryngeal, since coronal and laryngeal consonants lack a place of articulation node 
in Yip’s underspeciﬁ cation model. The majority of San’ani consonant clusters noted in this study have 
at least one coronal consonant.

Within this collection, I did not include all instances of tokens when tokens were 
repeated successively, as in št¤ in: št¤ gƒl št¤ ‘I want, he said, I want’. The majority 
of repeated tokens were instances of Fr–O combinations. In word-list readings, I 
would expect a higher number of Glide + Occlusive/Nasal/Liquid combinations 
since /y/ is the preﬁ x consonant for third person pronouns in the imperfect verb 
(e.g. yg¶l ‘he says’, ysƒﬁ r ‘he travels’, y	rub ‘he hits’). Interestingly, the highest 
proportion of consonant clusters resulting from syncope involve sonority ‘revers-
als’ and ‘plateaus’.18 The two most commonly attested combinations are sonority 
‘reversals’ which account for 30 per cent of the total consonant clusters. Of the 
‘reversals’ and ‘plateaus’, a high number involve initial or, less commonly, medial 
sibilant S19 (16 out of 21 Fr–O combinations involve initial S, and 13 out of 14 
Fr–Fr combinations have S as one of the two fricatives). Where syncope results 
in a sonority ‘reversal’ or ‘plateau’, I assume that the moraic content of the synco-
pated vowel is not lost and that the initial consonant associates with the disassoci-
ated mora. Syncope is represented notationally in (78) and (79).
Where syncope deletes the vowel in a CVC bimoraic syllable, the ‘coda’ consonant 
retains its mora and serves as the coda to a syllabic consonant if and only if the 
initial consonant of the original CVC syllable is more sonorous than the ﬁ nal con-
sonant, as in the derivation of škmih ‘lunch party for parturient’ in (80).

18 Wherever sonority plateaus are involved in syllable-initial consonant clusters, the distance 
between the respective places of articulation of the two segments is crucial: in no instances of sonor-
ity plateaus in the San’ani data are identical places of articulation attested. Instances of O–O involve 
combinations of /t/ + /k/ (usually in that order). To this can be added less common, but permissible, 
combinations: /b/ + /t/, /b/ + /d/, /b/ + /g/.

ments typically cluster together even if a language does not have the Obstruent Sequencing Principle’

4.5 conclusion
77
When the ﬁ nal (‘coda’) consonant of a syncopated CVC syllable has greater sonor-
ity than the initial consonant, however, the initial mora is lost after dissociation 
from the vowel, while the ‘coda’ consonant of that syllable retains its mora and 
functions as the syllable peak of the initial syllable, as illustrated in the derivation 
of tštay  20 ‘you f.s. want’ in (81).
4.5 CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have considered syllable structure and syllabiﬁ cation in Cairene 
and San’ani. Within the discussion, I established the basic syllable inventory for 
each dialect. I considered the analysis of phonological-word-ﬁ nal CVCCC syl-
lables in San’ani, and then discussed syllabiﬁ cation in the dialects. I considered 
three syllable repair processes—epenthesis, glottal stop prosthesis, and closed syl-
lable shortening. In the ﬁ nal section, I considered syncope in the two dialects. The 
issue of possible trimoraic syllables arose twice in the discussion: in the analysis 
of CVCCC syllables in San’ani, and in the discussion of word-internal CVVC syl-
lables in the same dialect. For both CVCCC syllables and word-internal CVVC 
syllables, an analysis of bimoraicity was proposed: in the ﬁ rst case it was demon-
strated that CVCCC syllables are avoided wherever possible, that they are restrict-
ed to phonological-word-ﬁ nal position, and that they occur only when the verbal 
suﬃ  xes {ﬁ rst person singular} or {second person masculine singular} and {nega-
tive} are concatenated. A bimoraic account of CVCCC syllables is possible by 
analysing ﬁ nal tš (derived from morpheme concatenation) as a surface aﬀ ricate 
which is extrasyllabic in domain-ﬁ nal position. In the case of internal CVVC syl-
lables, it was argued that CVVC syllables are a marked option, and usually occur 
only when the following object or possessive pronoun suﬃ  x begins with either 
/h/ or /n/. I concluded that CVVC syllables can be analysed as bimoraic and not 
as trimoraic on the basis of VC sharing a mora through Adjunction-to-Mora, as 
proposed by Broselow (1992) and Broselow et al. (1995, 1997) for other eastern 
dialects of Arabic.
In the discussion on syncope, I suggested that Broselow’s assumption that syn-
cope applies blindly in Arabic dialects to destroy vulnerable monomoraic syllables 
cannot fully account for dialects like San’ani in which syncope applies optionally 
20 In contrast to domain-ﬁ nal tš in CVCCC syllables considered in Section 4.3, tš is not analysed as 
an aﬀ ricate in the case of tštay ‘you f.s. want’. This is because /š/ has been independently assigned a 
mora through Weight-by-Position prior to the application of syncope. It retains its mora and functions 
as the syllable peak of a vowelless syllable owing to its relative high sonority.

at the beginning but not at the end of the phonological word, is partially lexical, 
and deletes vowels in bimoraic as well as in monomoraic syllables. Furthermore, 
I show that—as a result of stress ﬂ uctuation—syncope produces initial consonant 
clusters, a large percentage of which ﬂ out the Sonority Sequencing Principle. In 
the majority of these cases, the mora of the syncopated syllable is retained and 
re-associates with the relatively sonorous initial consonant. When the vowel of an 
originally bimoraic (CVC) syllable is subject to syncope, the rightmost C of the 
syllable retains its mora (assigned through Weight-by-Position), while the leftmost 
C associates with the mora of the syncoped vowel if and only if the leftmost C has 
greater sonority than the rightmost C. When the leftmost C of the original CVC 
syllable has less sonority than the rightmost C, the disassociated mora is lost and 
the ﬁ nal moraic C functions as the syllable peak of an initial syllable.

WORD STRESS
Arabic is a language with word stress.1 This means that one of the syllables in a 
content word is perceived as prominent and receives main stress. In words of more 
than two syllables in San’ani (optionally also in words of two syllables where the 
leftmost syllable is heavy and the rightmost syllable superheavy) one or more of 
the remaining syllables receives secondary stress. In Cairene, secondary stress is 
not perceived.
This chapter discusses the word-stress systems of Cairene and San’ani. In Sec-
tion 5.1 I consider the basic stress rules for each dialect. In Section 5.2 I intro-
duce the theoretical model assumed to analyse stress in the dialects. Within this 
section I consider the size of the minimal word in the dialects and the concept 
of degenerate feet. I then discuss the role of extrametricality and extrasyllabicity. 
In  Section 5.3 I present an analysis of word-stress assignment in Cairene. In Sec-
tion 5.4 I present an analysis of word-stress assignment in San’ani. To account for 
diﬀ erences between the stress systems of Cairene and San’ani, I look at the role 
of foot extrametricality, and the prosodic treatment of types of bimoraic syllables 
in San’ani. Other issues addressed in this chapter include stress ﬂ uctuation and 
secondary stress in San’ani.
5.1 WORD-STRESS PATTERNS
5.1.1 Word-stress patterns in Cairene
Word-stress patterns in Cairene have received a great deal of attention in recent 
years and have played a central role in the development of metrical theory. Syl-
lables in Cairene fall into three categories: light CV, heavy CVC and CVV, and 
superheavy CVCC and CVVC (see Section 4.2). Superheavy syllables are restrict-
ed to domain-ﬁ nal position, with the exception of a few lexicalized instances of 
word-internal CVVC syllables (see Section 4.3). The basic word-stress pattern, dis-
covered by Mitchell 1960, is stated below (following Hayes 1995 and McCarthy 
1979b). In my description of Cairene stress, I do not consider the pronunciation 
of Standard Arabic by Cairene speakers, in contrast to Mitchell, McCarthy, Hayes, 
and others. In the examples that follow,  denotes a following stressed syllable.
1 Although the classical Arab grammarians do not mention word stress, it is generally accepted that 
Classical Arabic had it. Proto-Semitic probably had free stress, however (Hetzron 1992: 413).

Cairene stress algorithm
 
(a) Stress a ﬁ nal superheavy or CVV syllable:

fala¤n 
‘peasants’
 
 
kitƒb 
‘book’
 
 
cafr¤t

(b) Otherwise stress a penultimate heavy (CVC or CVV) syllable:
 
 
b¢tak 
‘your m.s. house’
 
 
bintik 
‘your f.s. daughter’
 
 
darrasni 
‘he taught me’
 
 
mudarris ‘teacher’
 
 
yikallimhum 
‘he speaks to them’
 
(c)  Otherwise stress the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable, whichever 
is separated by an even number of syllables from the closest preceding 
heavy syllable (A), or—if there is no such syllable—from the beginning 
of the word (B):
 
 
ii. Penultimate stress

Two well-documented exceptions to (1cii) are that stress is always assigned to the 
penultimate syllable in the {third person feminine singular} inﬂ ectional form of 
the perfect verb with a V(C) object suﬃ  x (2a) (Abdel-Massih 1975: 26), and in a

5.1 word-stress patterns
81
 
5.1.2 Word-stress patterns in San’ani
San’ani has a stress system superﬁ cially very similar to several other eastern dia-
lects of Arabic, including what we take to have held for Classical Arabic.2 A typical 
peninsula Arabic stress system has the algorithm in (3).
(3) (a) Stress a ﬁ nal superheavy (CVCC or CVVC) syllable.
 
(b)  Otherwise stress the rightmost non-ﬁ nal heavy syllable (up to the antepe-
nultimate).
 
(c) Otherwise stress the leftmost light syllable.
This holds for stress assignment in most types of words in San’ani.
(4) (a) makt¶b 
‘letter’
 
 
darast 
‘I/you m.s. learnt’
 
 
gambart 
‘I/you m.s. sat’
 
(b) madrasih 
‘school’
 
 
tafruuh 
‘women’s party’
 
 
sƒfarat 
‘she travelled’
 
 
zumurjad 
‘emerald’
 
 
migambar ‘sitting’ 
 
 
makƒtib 
‘oﬃ  ces’, ‘libraries’
 
 
misƒlih 
‘launderette’
 
 
katabnƒ 
‘we wrote’
 
(c) katab 
‘he wrote’
 
 
libisat 
‘she wore’, ‘put on’
 
 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’
However, part (a) of the algorithm—assignment of stress to a ﬁ nal superheavy syl-
lable—fails to apply when the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable is CVV or 
ends in the left leg of a geminate consonant. Consider the following examples:
(5) ƒb¶n 
‘soap’
 
makƒt¤b 
‘letters’
 
xuƒf 
‘clasp’
 
mudarris¤n ‘teachers m.’
 
xƒrij¤n 
‘going out m.pl.’
 
sƒfart 
‘I/you m.s. travelled’
 
darrast 
‘I/you m.s. taught’
2 McCarthy (1979b) describes Classical Arabic as having unbounded feet (repeated in Hayes 1979: 
80, 1995: 296). However, scholars do not totally agree on the stress system of Classical Arabic. Wright 
claims the ‘accent is thrown back as far as possible’ in words lacking a penultimate or antepenultimate 
heavy syllable, e.g. masʔalatuhƒ ‘her problem’ (Wright 1971: 27–8). There is some evidence that Clas-
sical Arabic had bounded (binary) feet and that stress did not go further left than the antepenultimate 
syllable (Angoujard 1990: 282–5; Versteegh 1997: 90).

word stress
82
In the examples in (5), the rightmost non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syllable of the word 
is stressed. This stress pattern compares to that of dialects such as Sudanese and 
Cairene in which ﬁ nal superheavy syllables are invariably stressed, irrespective of 
the weight of adjacent syllables:
(6) 
Sudanese 
 
Cairene
 
masƒk¤n 
‘poor pl.’ 
masak¤n 
‘poor pl.’
 
kitƒb 
‘book’ 
kitƒb 
‘book’
 
mudarris¤n ‘teachers m.’ 
mudarris¤n 
‘teachers m.’
 
sƒfart 
‘I/you m.s. travelled’ 
darrast 
‘I/you m.s. taught’
In addition, while the rightmost non-ﬁ nal CVC syllable is stressed unless it falls in 
pre-antepenultimate position, as in maklaf ‘woman’, madrasih ‘school’, makta-
bih ‘library’ but maktabat¤ ‘my library’, the rightmost CVV or CVG syllable is 
stressed even when it falls in pre-antepenultimate position, as in:
(7) 
musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’
 
hƒkaahƒ 
‘like this’
The stress algorithm in (3) is revised for San’ani to take account of the behaviour 
of ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC and non-ﬁ nal CVV and CVG syllables.
(8) 
San’ani stress algorithm
 
(a) Stress the rightmost non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syllable.
 
 
 Examples: makƒtib ‘oﬃ  ces’, asƒm¤ ‘names’, basƒt¤n ‘gardens’, ƒb¶n 
‘soap’, xƒrij¤n ‘going out m.pl.’, dƒriyƒt ‘knowing f.pl.’, mitʔaxxirƒt 
‘late f.pl.’, yiibb¶ ‘they m. love, like’, musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’, 
hƒkaahƒ ‘like this’, sƒfart ‘I/you m.s. travelled’, dawwart ‘I/you m.s. 
looked for’.
 
(b) Otherwise stress a ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC syllable.
 
 
 Examples: darast ‘I/you m.s. learnt’, ʔabsart ‘I/you m.s. saw’, gambart 
‘I/you m.s. sat’, laflaft ‘I/you m.s. collected’, dišmƒn ‘rebel; poor m.s.’, 
banƒt ‘girls’.
 
(c)  Otherwise stress the rightmost non-ﬁ nal CVC syllable up to the ante-
penultimate.
 
 
 Examples: laﬂ af ‘he collected’, maklaf ‘woman’, madrasih ‘school’, 
maklaﬁ h ‘his woman’
 
(d) Otherwise stress the leftmost CV syllable.
 
 
 Examples: katab ‘he wrote’, darasat ‘she learnt’, ragabatih ‘his neck’, 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’.
 
(e)  Stress ﬁ nal CVV in disyllabic adjectives or di- or trisyllabic verbs in the 
imperfect.
 
 
Examples: yif  cal¶ ‘they m. do’, ar¤ ‘fresh’.
In contrast to many other eastern dialects of Arabic, San’ani also exhibits contextu-
ally ﬂ uctuating stress (Rossi 1939: 8; Goitein 1970: xvii; Diem 1973; Naïm-San-
bar 1994). Rossi claims that ‘The position of the stress depends on the emphasis of 

5.1 word-stress patterns
83
the utterance, on the position of the word within the sentence, and on the emphasis 
laid on the word’ (Rossi 1939: 8, translated in Rabin 1951: 103–4). In connected 
speech, stress ﬂ uctuates regularly when used for expressive accent or for emphasis, 
in pre- and post-pause position, when the word is the second term in a genitive 
When a word is repeated, it usually receives diﬀ erent stress in each of the two 
instances for expression or contrast. This is particularly the case when the word 
has the pattern CVC.CVC or CVV.CVC. In accordance with a rhythmic principle, 
the ﬁ rst word is stressed on the initial syllable and the following word on the ﬁ nal 
syllable, as in (9).
 (9) wƒid wƒid 
‘one by one’
 
wa-yif  cal¶ aﬂ ih aflih ‘they have lots of parties’
When a verb takes a consonant-initial object suﬃ  x, the initial syllable of a verb 
with a CVCVC template may be stressed to emphasize the action of the verb:
(10) gad 	arabhƒ ‘he did hit her/he hit her’
 
versus
 
gad 	arabhƒ ‘he hit her’
In post-pause position, there is a tendency for the ﬁ rst syllable of the word to be 
stressed, irrespective of its weight or the weight of the following syllable(s):
(11) (a) Bisyllables: gacƒd, tamƒm, 
alƒ
, ʔusb¶c, yidcaw, marih
 
(b) Trisyllables: yif  cal¶, yiba¶, daras¶
 
(c) Quadrisyllables: balad¤yƒt, yaman¤y¤n
However, when the initial syllable is the imperfect marker for either form II or 
form V verbs, or the participle preﬁ x mu-~mi- before a CVG syllable, the initial 
syllable is not assigned stress in any contextual position:
(12) yibannin¶, yigassim¶
As the second term of a genitive phrase or following the deﬁ nite article, an initial 
CVC syllable or CV syllable is usually stressed irrespective of the weight of the 
following syllable:
(13) yawm xam¤s 
‘a Thursday’
 
yawm i
nayn 
‘a Monday’
 
aš-šaƒb 
‘basil’
In pre-pause position, ﬁ nal CVC and CVV syllables are often stressed as an alter-
native to penultimate or antepenultimate stress. This mirrors the assignment of 
stress to initial syllables in post-pause position:
(14) Final stress Ante/penultimate stress

yuktub ‘he writes’

katab

marih

yidarris¶ 
yidarris¶ ‘they m. teach’
To enhance the prominence of a ﬁ nal stressed CVC syllable, the vowel of this syl-
lable may be either lengthened phonetically (cf. Hayes 1995: 100), as in (15), or 
the vowel of the initial destressed syllable subject to syncope, as in (16).

/marih/

/šikmih/

Where the prominent syllable of a word receives main sentence stress, the vowel 
or sonorant consonant of this syllable may also be lengthened, as in (17).
(17) gad¤ gariyih kab¤:rih 
‘it is a big village’
 
gad jaw an-nƒs kull:uhum ‘the people came, all of them’
5.2 THE THEORETICAL MODEL
The theoretical model I assume is the Metrical Stress Theory of Hayes (1995). The 
central claim of the theory is that stress is the linguistic manifestation of rhythmic 
structure, and that the special phonological properties of stress can be explained 
on this basis (Hayes 1995: 1). Where a language has secondary stress this is deter-
mined generally by a rhythmic principle which creates an alternation of stressed 
and unstressed syllables. The theory has six main aspects which are summarized 
in (18) (Hayes 1995: 2–3).
(18) (a)  Metrical structure is represented by the bracketed grid, which is a hier-
archy of rhythmic beats grouped into a hierarchy of constituents. With-
in the grids there are four layers above the segmental layer: the moraic 
layer, the syllable layer, the foot layer, and the word layer. In phrases, 
there is also a supra-word phrase layer. The grid columns are subject 
to the Continuous Column Constraint: if a mark is placed on the word 
layer for a column, that column will also have marks on the foot, syl-
lable, and moraic layers, as in the representation of Arabic katab ‘he 
wrote’ below. In this and following bracketed grids, the stressed ele-
ment of a foot/word is represented by × and the non-stressed element 
of the foot by a bullet •.

5.2 the theoretical model
85
 
 
 Similarly, where a constituent of a word receives main phrasal or sen-
tence stress, that constituent will also have a continuous column of 
marks on each of the word, foot, syllable, and moraic layers. This 
is exempliﬁ ed in the representation of katab kitƒb ‘he wrote a book’ 
where the ﬁ nal syllable of kitƒb receives both word and phrase stress:
 
(b)  The smallest metrical unit is the foot. A language may either have 
unbounded feet where the parameters of the metrical foot will be the 
entire phonological word, or bounded feet. There are three common 
bounded foot types: the moraic trochee, the syllabic trochee, and the 
iamb. Cairene and San’ani Arabic both have moraic trochee systems.
 
(c)  The basis of the foot inventory is a principle called the Iambic/Trochaic 
Law, which forms part of the theory of rhythm, not of language proper. 
This law determines the set of possible feet and motivates a large 
number of segmental rules that adjust metrical structure.
 
(d)  Metrical structure creation is non-exhaustive. This means that it need 
not exhaust the string of syllables in the word, and that some syllables 
may be left unaccounted for by metrical structure creation.
 
(e)  Many languages impose a ban on ‘degenerate’ feet—that is to say, in 
this case, languages that respect quantity disallow feet consisting of 
just one mora, and languages that do not respect quantity disallow feet 
consisting of just one syllable.
 
(f)  Syllable weight is not a unitary phenomenon; rather, languages dis-
tinguish between syllable quantity and syllable prominence. Quantity 
is represented by mora count, while prominence may be based on a 
number of other properties of the syllable, and is represented formally 
3 The treatment of domain-ﬁ nal consonants is discussed in Section 5.2.4.

with grid columns of varying height. Quantity may be referred to by 
rules of foot construction while prominence may be referred to by other 
metrical rule types, as in end rules and destressing.
5.2.1 The moraic model
The moraic model assumed is one in which short vowels are assigned one mora, 
long vowels two moras, and geminate consonants one mora underlyingly (see Sec-
tion 4.1; Hayes 1989).
In languages in which (C)VC syllables count as heavy, non-geminate consonants 
in the rhyme are assigned a mora at a later stage by the Weight-by-Position condi-
tion (see Section 4.1 and Hayes 1989, 1995: 52):
5.2.2 The iambic/trochaic division
Languages with bounded metrical feet have either iambic or trochaic feet. Iambic 
feet are formed from two elements which contrast in length, while trochaic feet 
are formed from two elements which contrast in intensity. This follows from the 
Iambic/Trochaic Law (Hayes 1995: 80) in (21).
(21) Iambic/Trochaic law
 
(a)  Elements contrasting in intensity form groupings with initial promi-
nence;
 
(b)  elements contrasting in duration naturally form groupings with ﬁ nal 
prominence.
Iambs are asymmetrical binary feet with a weak followed by a strong element, 
while trochees consist of elements which are roughly equal in duration. Iambs can 
be constructed from two light syllables of which the second is stressable:
(22) 
de de, de de, de de
The optimum iambic foot, however, is constructed from a light syllable followed 
by a heavy syllable.
(23) 
de de:, de de:, de de:
Many Arabic dialects spoken in North Africa have iambic stress systems. In 
Cyrenaican Bedouin, katab ‘he wrote’ is footed as in (24) with stress assigned to 
the ﬁ nal syllable.

5.2 the theoretical model
87
Although the majority of Arabic dialects have trochaic stress systems, much of 
Arabic morphology, including many singular nouns and adjectives (see Section 
6.4.2), basic form I verbal nouns, and the most common broken plural patterns 
(see Section 6.6) and the diminutive, is based on the optimum iamb: a light syl-
lable followed by a heavy syllable. The optimum iamb is exempliﬁ ed in aw¤l ‘tall’, 
attested in both Cairene and San’ani:
There are two types of trochaic systems: in the ﬁ rst type, feet are constructed from 
syllables, without regard for length, as in (26).

In the second type, feet are constructed from moras. Since the moraic trochee is 
based entirely on moras and not on syllables, a moraic trochee may be either two 
consecutive light syllables or a single heavy syllable—see (27).
An example of a disyllabic moraic trochee from Cairene and San’ani is katab ‘he 
wrote’:
An example of a monosyllabic moraic trochee is bƒb ‘door’, ‘gate’, in (29).

5.2.3 Degenerate feet and the minimal word
A binary foot consists of either two moras (a moraic trochee), two syllables (a syl-
labic trochee), or a light followed by a heavy syllable or two light syllables (an 
iamb). The question arises over how to deal with sub-minimal elements which are 
left over at the end of a string. These are a single mora (in a moraic trochee system), 
a single syllable (in a syllabic trochee system), or a single light syllable (in an 
iambic system). Sub-minimal feet which survive to the surface are described by 
Hayes (1995: 87) as degenerate feet. Languages diﬀ er in their treatment of degen-
erate feet: if a language bans degenerate feet absolutely, a sub-minimal element 
at the end of a footed string will simply be left unaccounted for in the parse. If, 
on the other hand, degenerate feet are permitted in the language, the sub-minimal 
element at the end of a footed string will be assigned a foot and this foot will be 
stressed. Most languages impose an absolute ban on degenerate feet, but some lan-
guages have a weak ban on degenerate feet and allow them in strong position. The 
prohibition of degenerate feet from Hayes is in (30).
(30) Prohibition on degenerate feet
 
Foot parsing may form degenerate feet under the following conditions:
 
(a) strong prohibition absolutely disallowed;
 
(b)  weak prohibition allowed only in strong position, that is, when domi-
nated by another grid mark.
The treatment of degenerate feet and the size of the minimal word in a language are 
closely related. This is due to a requirement that every word contain at least one 
foot (Hayes 1995: 47). If a language allows sub-minimal content words—that is, 
content words which are smaller than a proper foot—then it may allow stressable 
degenerate feet within larger phonological words.
In general, freestanding, stressable (non-clitic) words in Arabic are minimally 
bimoraic (McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 17–22). Examples include: katab ‘he 
wrote’, bayt ‘house’ (SA), b¢t ‘house’ (CA), kƒm ‘how much’ (CA). Loan words 
which do not meet the minimality condition are generally modiﬁ ed to conform 
to the bimoraic requirement, as in: bƒr ‘bar’ (CA), šƒl ‘shawl’, ƒz (SA) / gƒz 
(CA) ‘gas’. There are a few words in Arabic which are sub-minimal in their non-
suﬃ  xed form but expanded in their suﬃ  xed form. These include ab ‘father’ and ax 
‘brother’. In San’ani, -¶- is added before all but the ﬁ rst person singular possessive 
suﬃ  x, -¤, so ab becomes ab¤ ‘my father’, but ab¶k ‘your m.s. father’, ab¶š ‘your f.s.

father’, and ab¶na ‘our father’; ax becomes ax¤ ‘my brother’, but ax¶k ‘your m.s. 
brother’ and ax¶na ‘our brother’. In isolation, Cairene reﬂ exes of *ab and *ax 
are realized with doubling of the consonant as abb and axx. Once possessive pro-
noun suﬃ  xes are added the consonant is realized as non-geminate and, to com-
pensate, -¶- is added, as in ab¶ya ‘my father’, ab¶k ‘your m.s. father’, ab¶na 
‘our father’; similarly, ax(x) becomes ax¶ya ‘my brother’, ax¶k ‘your m.s. broth-
er’, ax¶na ‘our brother’. In addition, for most modern Arabic dialects, including 
Cairene (Woidich and Heinen-Nasr 1995: 104) and San’ani (Watson 1996: 45), 
monomoraic prepositions ending in /n/ undergo n-gemination before pronoun suf-
ﬁ xes (see Section 8.1.3). Consider the following examples from San’ani.
(31) 
/can + ih/ 
cannih 
‘about him/it m.s.’
 
/min + ak/ 
minnak ‘from you m.s.’
When a possessive suﬃ  x begins with a consonant, n-gemination induces epen-
thesis. The examples in (32) are attested in both dialects:
(32) 
/min + hum/ minn[u]hum 
‘from them (m.)’
 
/can + kum/ 
cann[u]kum 
‘about you m.pl.’
San’ani has a few sub-minimal content words which do not conform to the mini-
mal bimoraicity condition—in addition to ab and ax mentioned above, the words 
yad ‘hand’ and dam ‘blood’. It also has a few sub-minimal non-clitic function 
words which contrast with comparable bimoraic words in Cairene. These include 
kam ‘how many’ (cf. Cairene kƒm), bih ‘there is’ (cf. Cairene f¤), man ‘who’ (cf. 
c

According to the claim made at the beginning of this section, an absolute ban 
on degenerate feet in a moraic trochee system means that a light syllable which is 
not footed at the beginning of a string, or which is left over at the end of a string, 
will remain unfooted. This prediction is borne out in Cairene. In the word kataba 
‘clerks’, the foot parse proceeds from left to right to produce a left-headed foot 
over the syllables (ka.ta). The rightmost syllable (ba) is light, consisting of a single 
mora, and can therefore not support a foot. This syllable remains unfooted since 
Cairene bans degenerate feet absolutely, and main stress is assigned to the head of 
the rightmost foot, the initial syllable ka—see (33).

of degenerate feet in San’ani on the basis of the minimal word is not so clearcut,
however.

In San’ani, a ﬁ nal light syllable which is left over at the end of a string generally 
remains unfooted and will not be stressed, as exempliﬁ ed in gašaat ‘she shivered’ 
in (34).
However, in post-pause position, after the ﬁ rst term of a genitive phrase, or after 
the deﬁ nite article, an initial CV syllable is often stressed in disyllabic or trisyllab-
ic words irrespective of the weight of the rightmost syllable. Thus, in post-pause 
position tamƒm ‘okay’ typically bears initial stress.
This appears to indicate that in San’ani, degenerate feet are permitted in strong pos-
ition in speciﬁ ed prosodic environments.4 I shall return to the discussion of degen-
erate feet in San’ani below when I consider stress ﬂ uctuation in the dialect.
5.2.4 Extrametricality
Extrametricality was ﬁ rst invoked in metrical stress theory to deal with the fact that 
syllables must contain more segments to act as heavy in ﬁ nal position than in word-
internal position (see Section 4.2). This asymmetry is dealt with by proposing that 
ﬁ nal consonants are extrametrical in a number of languages including Cairene and 
San’ani Arabic. Extrametricality is subject to the Peripherality Condition (Hayes 
1981, 1995) in (36).
(36) Peripherality Condition
 
 A constituent may be extrametrical only if it is at a designated edge (left or 
right) of its domain.

4 As in Negev Bedouin Arabic, which has an iambic stress system and which is analysed in Hayes 
(on the basis of data from Blanc 1970) as imposing a weak prohibition on degenerate feet (Hayes 1995: 
228).

5.2 the theoretical model
91
Consonant extrametricality is illustrated by placing the peripheral consonant in 
angled brackets (see also Section 4.2):
The ﬁ nal consonant is syllabiﬁ ed with the rightmost syllable at a later stage in the 
derivation, but because of its extrametrical status it fails to be assigned a mora 
through the Weight-by-Position condition; thus, the syllable in which it is syllabi-
ﬁ ed counts as light (monomoraic) and not as heavy (bimoraic).
Extrametricality accounts not only for cases where the ﬁ nal consonant is extra-
metrical, but also where the word layer rule selects a non-ﬁ nal foot for main stress. 
In this case, the peripheral foot is deemed to be extrametrical. There is evidence 
from many languages, including dialects of Arabic (for instance, Palestinian, Egyp-
tian radio Arabic, Bani-Hassan, Sudanese, and San’ani), that the presence of an 
extrametrical consonant in a peripheral foot does not deprive the foot of peripheral-
ity in its own right (Hayes 1995: 105–6). This is because the extrametrical conso-
nant is contained within the peripheral foot and does not come between the foot 
and the rightmost edge. In (38), the extrametrical  C  is peripheral on the segmental 
layer but contained within the extrametrical foot 〈(× •)〉, which is peripheral on the 
foot layer.
To allow higher level extrametrical constituents to contain lower level extramet-
rical constituents, Hayes proposes the following rule:
(39)  Extrametrical higher level constituents may dominate extrametrical lower 
level constituents.
In San’ani, peripheral feet are eligible for foot extrametricality. In the derivation 
of madrasih, the peripheral (rightmost) foot is rendered extrametrical and is thus 
invisible to the stress rules. At the word layer, a continuous column of grid marks 
is produced by placing a grid mark above the only visible grid mark on the foot 
layer to give the stressed form madrasih ‘school’—see (40).

Foot extrametricality is also subject to the Nonexhaustivity Condition (Hayes 
1995: 58; cf. Prince 1983: 80). The Nonexhaustivity Condition ensures that foot 
extrametricality is blocked from applying where the peripheral foot is the only foot 
in the word, and where extrametricality would exhaust the entire domain of the 
stress rules. In katab ‘he wrote’, consonant extrametricality applies and a bimoraic 
foot is constructed over the two light syllables of the word. The peripheral foot 
constitutes the only foot in the word, therefore foot extrametricality is blocked 
from applying. Stress is assigned to the head of the foot, the leftmost syllable.
5.2.5 Extrasyllabicity
It has been demonstrated that certain consonants fall outside the domain of the syl-
lable and remain unsyllabiﬁ ed until a late stage in the derivation. Since superheavy 
syllables (CVVC, CVCC) in Arabic are generally restricted to domain-ﬁ nal pos-
ition (see also Section 4.3) while non-ﬁ nal syllables must have the structure CV, 
CVV, or CVC, it is assumed that the ﬁ nal consonant, C¹, of superheavy syllables is 
extrasyllabic and is not incorporated into the adjacent syllable:
In contrast to extrametrical consonants, which link directly with the syllable node 
of the peripheral syllable, the extrasyllabic consonant falls into what Aoun (1979), 
Selkirk (1981), and Kager (1995: 376) describe as a degenerate syllable. Thus, 
word-ﬁ nal CVVC and CVCC syllables in languages which do not permit non-
word-ﬁ nal CVVC and CVCC syllables are analysed as two syllables—a canonical

syllable plus a degenerate syllable.5, 6 The role of the extrasyllabic consonant is dif-
ferent from that of the extrametrical consonant: an extrametrical consonant may 
be contained within an extrametrical foot, but an extrasyllabic consonant blocks 
foot extrametricality by virtue of coming between the foot and the rightmost edge 
of the word. An extrametrical foot adjacent to an extrasyllabic consonant would 
violate the Peripherality Condition (36) and result in ‘chained’ extrametricality 
(Hayes 1995: 107), illustrated in (43).
Hayes excludes chained extrametricality by the constraint in (44).
(44)  Extrametricality does not chain; i.e. a constituent followed by an extramet-
rical constituent is not counted as peripheral.
 
5.3 WORD STRESS IN CAIRENE
A metrical analysis of stress in Cairene is fairly straightforward, in spite of the 
apparent complexity of surface forms (see Section 5.1.1). Cairene has a moraic 
trochee system. The foot parse takes place from left to right and degenerate feet 
are forbidden absolutely. In contrast to many other dialects of Arabic, foot extra-
metricality does not apply. Word construction rules assign stress to the head of the 
rightmost foot according to End Rule Right (ERR). The rules of stress assignment 
in Cairene are summarized in (45).

Cairene has a number of unstressable morphemes which are cliticized to the fol-
lowing word (see Section 4.4): these include the verbal preﬁ xes bi- (habitual/
continuous), a- (future), conjunctions wi- ‘and’ and fa- ‘then’, and the negative 
preﬁ x ma. The dialect also has a few sub-minimal function words which are 
stressed only when they take a pronoun suﬃ  x (see Section 5.2.3). These include 
miš ‘not’ and the monomoraic prepositions min ‘from’, can ‘about’, and ﬁ  ‘in’.

5 Logically this means that languages which have ﬁ nal stress if and only if the ﬁ nal syllable is 
superheavy (such as Cairene) do not, in fact, ever have ﬁ nal stress but rather penultimate stress.
6 In many dialects of Arabic, a prosodic diﬀ erence exists between CVVC and CVCC syllables. Sec-
tion 4.4.1.3 looks at word-internal CVVC syllables in San’ani, and Section 5.4.1 compares and consid-
ers in detail domain-ﬁ nal CVVC and CVCC syllables.

Cairene is exempliﬁ ed in the derivation of katabit ‘she wrote’. The foot parse takes 
place from left to right. The two light syllables ka.ta. form a foot. The ﬁ nal syllable 
(with its extrametrical consonant, t) is light and cannot support a foot. Degenerate 
feet are banned absolutely in the dialect, so the ﬁ nal syllable remains unfooted. 
ERR assigns stress to the head of the rightmost foot, the initial syllable.7
Final superheavy syllables are analysed as a bimoraic syllable plus a degenerate 
syllable. The bimoraic syllable forms a canonical foot which is invariably stressed 
according to ERR. This is exempliﬁ ed in darast ‘I/you m.s. learnt’:
In words which lack a ﬁ nal superheavy syllable, a heavy penult is invariably 
stressed. In darastu ‘I/you m.s. learnt it m.’, the ﬁ rst syllable cannot form a foot, 
nor can it constitute the head of a foot with the following bimoraic syllable. The 
heavy penult forms a foot. The ﬁ nal monomoraic syllable remains unfooted. Stress 
is assigned according to ERR to the only visible foot in the word:
A major diﬀ erence between stress assignment in Cairene and that in many other 
eastern dialects of Arabic, including San’ani, Palestinian, Sudanese, and Abha 
Arabic, is in the treatment of peripheral feet. In Cairene, peripheral feet are not 
rendered extrametrical, while in other dialects (including Egyptian radio Arabic, 
according to Hayes’s 1995: 131–2 analysis of data in Harrell 1960) foot extramet-
ricality appears to be at least optional. Lack of foot extrametricality explains the 
failure of the antepenultimate heavy syllable to be stressed in words such as madra-
sa ‘school’, muškila ‘problem’, and maktaba ‘library’. In the derivation of muškila 
‘problem’, lack of foot extrametricality, which would have rendered the rightmost 
foot invisible to stress rules, ensures stress is assigned through ERR to the penulti-
mate light syllable—see (49).

5.3 word stress in cairene
95
Forms such as ʔablak ‘he met you m.s.’ (< /ʔƒbil + ak/) and safru ‘they travelled’ 
(< /sƒﬁ r + u/) have the same underlying heavy–light–light syllable structure as 
madrasa ‘school’. However, in these words the high vowel of the penultimate syl-
lable is deleted and stress assigned to the leftmost syllable. The prosodic diﬀ er-
ence between the two word types lies in the initial heavy syllable: CVV in the 
case of /ʔƒbil + ak/, CVC in the case of madrasa. In words with the template 
CVVCiCV(c) the parse proceeds according to the rules given in (45), with stress 
initially assigned to the penultimate syllable—the head of the rightmost foot:
Unstressed long vowels are reduced in Cairene (see Section 9.1.1). The initial long 
vowel in the leftmost syllable is therefore subject to unstressed long vowel shorten-
ing:
The resulting initial CV syllable can no longer support a foot. The foot parse 
applies again, locating the penultimate CV syllable in the weak element of the 
foot:
The unstressed high vowel in the penultimate syllable is subject to syncope (see 
Section 4.4.2.1), and the output is ʔablak ‘he met you m.s.’

5.3.1 Exceptions to the stress algorithm
The two exceptions to the stress algorithm given in (2), and in particular the stress 
pattern of verbs in the {third person feminine singular} inﬂ ectional form in the per-
fect aspect, have exercised researchers over the years (Broselow 1976; McCarthy 
1979b; Angoujard 1981). Where the {third person feminine singular} inﬂ ectional 
form takes a vowel-initial object suﬃ  x, /i/ of the {third person feminine singular} 
suﬃ  x always falls in a stressed syllable, irrespective of the number and weight of 
the preceding syllables in the word.8 Likewise the light penult is always stressed in 
plurals with the structure CiCiCa or CuCuCa. Since both cases involve the excep-
tional stressing of a light penult, I shall consider these exceptions together.
Without an object suﬃ  x, the {third person feminine singular} inﬂ ectional form 
of the perfect verb is stressed according to the rules given in (45). Verbs with three 
light syllables or a heavy followed by a light syllable are stressed on the initial syl-
lable, as in: 	arabit ‘she hit’ and šƒﬁ t ‘she saw’. 	arabit ‘she hit’ is diagrammed 
in (53).
Verbs with a heavy antepenult and two following light syllables are stressed on the 
penult, as in istacmilit ‘she used’:
When the {third person feminine singular} inﬂ ectional form takes a vowel-initial 
object suﬃ  x (/ak/, /ik/, /u/) stress is invariably assigned to the light penult. In forms 
with four light syllables, stress appears to be placed predictably on the head of the 
rightmost foot:
8 McCarthy (1979a) adds a rule to Cairene grammar which constructs a special foot associating 
the rhyme of -it- with any node immediately following it, thereby placing -it- as the head of a ﬁ nal 
foot. Angoujard (1981: 89–90) attributes an ‘indestructable rhyme’ to the -it- morpheme. Later (1990: 
120–1), he assigns special status to the -it- morpheme reﬂ ected in a three-slotted grid [* * *]. This 
analysis is both adequate and desirable for dialects such as Tunisian where /t/ of the morpheme is gemi-
nated on suﬃ  xation. However, for Cairene, this is a rather ad hoc device which provides a phonological 
explanation for a morphological fact—namely /i/ of the {third person feminine singular} morpheme is 
never deleted, and the syllable in which the morpheme falls always assigned word stress.

5.3 word stress in cairene
97
A form containing three light syllables, however, is also stressed on the penult, 
as in: ramitu ‘she threw it m.’. This is identical to penultimate stress in CiCiCa 
or CuCuCa plurals, as exempliﬁ ed by iriba ‘crows’, sibita ‘baskets’, ubuca 
‘hyenas’, subuca ‘lions’ and tukusa ‘taxis’. Where a {third person feminine singu-
lar} verb + object suﬃ  x contains an underlying long vowel followed by two light 
syllables, the light penult is also stressed. Thus šalitu ‘she took it m.’ (< /šƒlit + 
u/) contrasts with safru ‘they travelled’ (< /sƒﬁ r + u/) and ʔablak ‘he met you 
m.s.’ (< /ʔƒbil + ak/). In these cases, the rules in (45) suggest that stress is assigned 
exceptionally to the weak element of the foot, in violation of the Continuous Col-
umn Constraint:
There are a number of possible ways of dealing with these exceptional stress pat-
terns—but all of them must make reference to the morphology. One possible solu-
tion would be to state that in speciﬁ c lexicalized cases primary stress is assigned to 
the penultimate syllable; an alternative solution would be to state that left-headed 
binary foot construction takes place from right to left if and only if the {third 
person feminine singular} perfect verb + object suﬃ  x or the CiCiCa or CuCuCa 
plural is involved.
Let us consider the consequences of reversing the direction of stress assignment 
exceptionally. Stress would be assigned to ramitu ‘she threw it m.’ as follows. The 
rightmost two syllables mi.tu. form a left-headed foot. No foot is constructed over 
the initial light syllable ra. since it is sub-minimal. ERR applies assigning stress to 
the penultimate syllable:
The form katabitu ‘she wrote it m.’ would be constructed as follows. The right-
most two syllables bi.tu. form left-headed foot. A second left-headed foot is 
formed by the leftmost two syllables ka.ta. There are no stray syllables in the word. 
ERR assigns stress to the head of the rightmost foot, the penultimate syllable:
The form šalitu ‘she carried it m.’ would be constructed according to the rules 
proposed, with reduction of the unstressed long vowel (see Section 9.1.1):

Under a lexical approach, it is assumed that stress assignment in CiCiCa or 
CuCuCa plurals and the {third person feminine singular} perfect verb + object suf-
ﬁ x is driven entirely by lexical factors: primary stress is assigned directly to the 
penult. There are historical reasons to assume that this is the correct analysis. The 
{second} and {third person masculine} singular object suﬃ  xes which are vowel-
initial in Cairene today are consonant-initial in Standard Arabic, and are consonant-
initial in Cairene when suﬃ  xed to vowel-ﬁ nal stems (cf. Section 7.1, Broselow 
1976: 131). It is highly probable that the object suﬃ  xes were consonant-initial in 
all environments at some stage in the development of the language. At this stage, 
the vowel of the {third person feminine singular} morpheme would have been 
realized in a heavy syllable on suﬃ  xation of an object suﬃ  x, as in katabithu ‘she 
wrote it m.’ and ramitki ‘she threw you f.s.’, which contrast with today’s katabitu 
‘she wrote it m.’ and ramitik ‘she threw you f.s.’. Stress would therefore have been 
assigned predictably to the penultimate heavy syllable. I conjecture that this histor-
ical stress pattern persisted after the {second} and {third person masculine} singu-
lar object suﬃ  xes became vowel initial during the development of the language.
Many of the CiCiCa plurals have an alternative and older pattern iCCiCa, as in 
iriba ~ iriba ‘crows’, dirica ~ idrica ‘arms’, and sibita ~ isbita ‘baskets’ (Woidich 
1999: 46). In the iCCiCa pattern, stress is assigned to the light penult according to 
(45). This is exempliﬁ ed in the representation of isbita ‘baskets’ in (60).
As for the {third person feminine singular} verb + object suﬃ  x, it appears that 
this stress pattern was lexicalized and remained after iCCiCa was reanalysed as 
CiCiCa. I further conjecture that this penultimate stress pattern was generalized to 
additional plurals formed directly on the CiCiCa pattern, and to plurals formed on 
the CuCuCa pattern.
5.4 WORD STRESS IN SAN’ANI
Stress assignment in San’ani diﬀ ers in two principal ways from that in Cairene. 
Firstly, while a ﬁ nal superheavy syllable is always stressed in Cairene, a penul-
timate or antepenultimate heavy open syllable (CVV) or syllable ending in the 
left leg of a geminate (CVG) takes precedence over a ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC syllable

in San’ani. Thus, San’ani ƒb¶n ‘soap’ contrasts with Cairene ab¶n; San’ani 
xƒrij¤n ‘going out m.pl.’ with Cairene xarg¤n; San’ani jazzƒr ‘butcher’ with 
Cairene gazzƒr; San’ani mitʔaxxirƒt ‘late f.pl.’ with Cairene mitʔaxxirƒt; and 
San’ani darrast ‘I/you m.s. taught’ with Cairene darrast. Secondly, a heavy syl-
lable is stressed in Cairene if and only if it occurs in penultimate position. If 
it occurs in antepenultimate position, the following light syllable is stressed. In 
San’ani, by contrast, a heavy antepenultimate syllable is stressed: Cairene maktaba 
‘library’ contrasts with San’ani maktabih ‘library’, and Cairene mudarrisa ‘teach-
er f.’ with San’ani mudarrisih ‘teacher f.’ In the latter case, the diﬀ erence between 
stress assignment in the two dialects is attributed to the permission of foot extra-
metricality in San’ani, but not in Cairene. In the former case, the diﬀ erence in 
stress is due to a prosodic diﬀ erence in San’ani between CVV/CVG syllables, on 
the one hand, and CVC syllables, on the other. The rules for assignment of word 
stress in San’ani are summarized below:
(61) (a) Consonant Extrametricality C → 〈C〉  /___]word
 
(b) Foot Construction 
Form moraic trochees from left to right.
 
 
 
 Degenerate feet are permitted in strong 
position [in limited prosodic environ-
ments].
 
(c) Foot Extrametricality 
Foot → 〈Foot〉 /___]word
 
(d) Word Layer Construction 
End Rule Right
As in Cairene, San’ani has a few unstressable morphemes and parts of morphemes 
which are cliticized to the preceding or following word (see Section 4.4). These 
include the copula gad, the verbal preﬁ xes bi- (habitual), ca- (future), the conjunc-
tions wa- and fa-, and the initial syllable in form VII and VIII verbs where stress is 
assigned to the penultimate syllable,9 as in: yinšail ‘he is occupied’, yištail ‘he 
works’ and yiktasib ‘he earns’.
San’ani madrasih exempliﬁ es consonant and foot extrametricality:
The ﬁ nal consonant is rendered extrametrical. The foot parse proceeds from left to 
right. The ﬁ rst heavy (bimoraic) syllable forms a foot. The two following light syl-
lables form a second foot. The rightmost foot is extrametrical since it is peripheral 
and does not exhaust the prosodic domain (see Section 5.2.4). ERR assigns stress 
to the rightmost visible foot.
9 All these morphemes may be stressed in San’ani, however, either for metalinguistic reasons or as 
a result of stress ﬂ uctuation (see Section 5.4.4).

As in Cairene, heavy penults are stressed in words which contain no domain-
ﬁ nal CVVC or CVCC. This is exempliﬁ ed in (63) for ʔabsartih ‘I/you m.s. saw 
him/it m.’.
The ﬁ nal consonant is extrametrical. The foot parse applies from left to right. Two 
feet are formed. The rightmost foot is rendered non-peripheral by the ﬁ nal unfoot-
ed light syllable and is thus protected from extrametricality. Stress is assigned 
according to ERR.
Stems with the template CVC¤ such as ar¤ ‘fresh’, and di- and trisyllabic verbs 
with a long vowel or diphthong suﬃ  x such as yif    cal¶ ‘they m. do’, yijaw ‘they m. 
come’ and tištay ‘you f.s. want’ are stressed on the ﬁ nal long vowel or diphthong. 
Consider the representation of yiktub¶ ‘they m. write’.
A foot is constructed over the initial bimoraic syllable. The medial light syllable 
is skipped because it neither constitutes a foot on its own nor forms a foot with 
the following bimoraic syllable. The ﬁ nal CVV syllable forms a foot. ERR assigns 
stress to the head of the rightmost foot—the rightmost syllable.
One of the issues I address below is the failure of ﬁ nal CVV to be rendered extra-
metrical in trisyllabic words such as yiktub¶, arjul¤, and yif  cal¶ in view of the 
fact that peripheral feet are extrametrical in San’ani subject to the Nonexhaustiv-
ity Condition. To appreciate the peculiarity of yif  cal¶ forms consider the stress 
of trisyllabic words of the template CVCVCVV and the stress of quadrisyllabic 
words ending in CVV.
In contrast to yif  cal¶, the peripheral foot is rendered extrametrical and stress is 
assigned to the head of the rightmost visible foot to give katab¶ ‘they m. wrote’.
Consider now the derivation of the quadrisyllabic word maktabat¤ ‘my library’ 
in (66).

5.4 word stress in san’ani
101
Foot construction creates three binary feet. The rightmost foot formed by a CVV 
syllable is rendered extrametrical and stress is assigned according to ERR to give 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’.
The extrametricality of ﬁ nal CVV in speciﬁ ed prosodic domains is related to 
the unusual behaviour of CVV and CVG syllables, particularly in the environment 
of ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC syllables. In Section 5.4.1 I look at the common account 
of domain-ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC as a canonical syllable plus an extrasyllabic conso-
nant and show that this analysis cannot account for the stress patterns of words 
with ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC and non-ﬁ nal CVV/CVG syllables. I then consider stress 
patterns in suﬃ  xation which demonstrate that stress tends to shift to the right in suf-
ﬁ xed words if and only if no non-ﬁ nal CVV/CVG syllable is contained within the 
word. In Section 5.4.1.2 I adopt Hayes’s syllable-internal two-layer moraic grid 
which enables us to capture the fact that CVC in San’ani is prosodically heavy in 
some environments but not in others. Underlyingly moraic elements are assigned 
a mora at the upper and lower moraic layers, while elements which become moraic 
through Weight-by-Position are assigned a mora at the lower layer only. In Section 
5.4.2 I return to the issue of ﬁ nal CVV syllables and demonstrate that the two-layer 
moraic grid sheds light on the behaviour of CVV-ﬁ nal words: the peripheral CVV 
foot is rendered extrametrical if and only if an adjacent foot comprises two moras 
on each of the moraic layers.
5.4.1 Domain-ﬁ nal CVVC/CVCC
Under the common account of domain-ﬁ nal superheavy syllables, C of a CVXC 
syllable is described as extrasyllabic (Hayes 1995: 106–7, Kager 1995: 376) or 
forms a degenerate syllable (Aoun 1979; Selkirk 1981), as in (67).
The extrasyllabic consonant blocks extrametricality of the adjacent syllable and 
bimoraic foot, CVV or CVC, by depriving this syllable of peripherality (see Sec-
tion 5.2.5). In gambart ‘I/you m.s. sat’, stress is assigned as follows:
A foot is constructed over the heavy syllable .gam. A second foot is constructed 
over the syllable .bar. Foot extrametricality is blocked by the presence of the 
degenerate syllable, and stress is assigned according to ERR.

This type of analysis cannot, however, explain the stress pattern in San’ani 
words where the ante/penultimate syllable is CVV/CVG and the ﬁ nal syllable 
is superheavy. Word stress fails to be assigned to either a ﬁ nal CVVC or a ﬁ nal 
CVCC syllable in these cases: gambart ‘I/you m.s. sat’ contrasts with dawwart 
‘I/you m.s. looked for’ and sƒfart ‘I/you m.s. travelled’; and makt¶b ‘letter’ con-
trasts with jazzƒr and ƒb¶n ‘soap’.
The stress pattern of words ending in CVCC or CVVC in San’ani is dependent 
on whether or not a non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syllable falls in the word. Thus, there 
must be some prosodic diﬀ erence between CVC and CVV/CVG syllables, syl-
lables which in most other dialects of Arabic are prosodically identical. While in 
some languages (although no modern Arabic dialects of which I have knowledge) 
CVC acts as a light syllable, we cannot say that CVC is light in San’ani, since it 
is not treated as light in all environments: in trisyllabic words in which the penulti-
mate syllable is CVC and the initial syllable is CV, CVC is stressed:
(69) 
zumurjad 
‘emerald’
 
migambar ‘sitting’
 
milaxba 
‘smudged’
 
	arabhum ‘he hit them m.’
 
katabtih 
‘I/you m.s. wrote it m.’
If CVC were treated as monomoraic in these cases, stress would be placed on the 
ﬁ rst syllable (which would form a bimoraic foot with the following syllable), as it 
is in words comprising three light (CV) syllables, as in (70).
(70) libisat 
‘she put on, wore’
 
katabat 
‘she wrote’
 
kutubih 
‘his books’
 
bagarih 
‘cow’
Before I propose a prosodic analysis of CVG and CVC syllables in San’ani, I shall 
consider the stress patterns of suﬃ  xed words in Arabic.
5.4.1.1 Stress patterns in sufﬁ xation
In a typical trochaic-type dialect of Arabic, stress shifts to the right when a conso-
nant-initial suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to the word. Stress shift is exempliﬁ ed in the following 
words from Cairene:
(71) katab 
‘he wrote’ 
darras 
‘he taught’
 
katabha 
‘he wrote it f.’ 
darrasha 
‘he taught her’
 
ma-katabhƒš ‘he didn’t write it f.’ 
ma-darrashƒš ‘he didn’t teach her’
In San’ani, by contrast, stress shift fails to take place when the word is stressed in 
its non-suﬃ  xed form on either a CVG syllable or a CVV syllable. Consider the 
examples in (72).

5.4 word stress in san’ani
103
(72) (a) adawwir 
‘I look for’ 
kassar 
‘he broke’
 
 
adawwirhum ‘I look for them m.’ kassarhƒ 
‘he broke it f.’
 
(b) gƒlat 
‘she said’ 
jƒrih 
‘neighbour f.’
 
 
gƒlatlih 
‘she said to him’ 
jƒratnƒ 
‘our neighbour f.’
 
(c) xabƒyir 
‘friends f.’
 
 
xabƒyirhƒ 
‘her friends f.’
Similarly, when a word is stressed in its non-suﬃ  xed form on an antepenultimate 
CVG or CVV syllable, stress does not shift when a suﬃ  x is added:
(73) 
musajjilih 
‘recorder’ 
hƒkaƒ 
‘like this’
 
musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’ hƒkaahƒ 
‘like this [emphatic]’
In the unmarked case, stress does shift to the right, however, when the non-suﬃ  xed 
word is stressed on either a CV or CVC syllable:10
(74) (a) arxa 
‘cheaper’ 
aškal 
‘better’
 
 
arxalih 
‘cheaper for him’ 
aškallih ‘better for him’
 
(b) 	arab 
‘he hit’
 
 
	arabkum ‘he hit you m.pl.’
 
(c) maktabih 
‘library’
 
 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’
Stress also shifts to the right from a CVV syllable where the ﬁ nal syllable of the 
non-suﬃ  xed word is CVVC or CVV:
(75) j¤rƒn 
‘neighbours’ j¤rƒnih 
‘his neighbours’
 
asƒm¤ ‘names’ 
asƒm¤hum ‘their m. names’
5.4.1.2 The representation of CVG versus CVC
Stress shift in suﬃ  xed words fails to apply from a CVG (or CVV) syllable to a CVC 
syllable for precisely the same reasons that domain-ﬁ nal CVXC is stressed when 
the adjacent syllable is CVC but not when it is CVG (or CVV). The asymmetrical 
behaviour of CVC and CVG syllables indicates that at some level these syllables 
are not prosodically identical. Recall that in the moraic model assumed, underly-
ing vowels are assigned a single mora, underlying long vowels, two moras, and 
underlying geminate consonants, a single mora, as in (19), repeated here as (76).
Although non-geminate consonants in the rhyme are assigned a mora at a later 
stage by Weight-by-Position (WP), geminate consonants are moraically distinct

from non-geminate consonants at the level of underlying representation. I assume 
that it is this underlying moraic distinctness which accounts for the asymmetry in 
San’ani between CVC and CVG syllables. The underlying moraic distinctness can 
be captured by adopting a two-layered grid within the syllable, where the height of 
a column depends on the sonority of the segment associated with it (Hayes 1995: 
300, drawing on Prince 1983). Segments which are underlyingly moraic have a 
mora on each of the two layers, while segments which are assigned a mora by WP 
have a mora on the lower layer only:
Processes which treat CVC as heavy refer to the lower moraic layer, while proc-
esses which treat CVC as light refer to the upper moraic layer (Hayes 1995: 300). 
Hayes suggests that the requirements of syllable-external prosody, including foot-
ing and word minima, are characteristically enforced at the upper moraic layer, 
while syllable-internal requirements such as mora population limits are character-
istically enforced at the lower layer (Hayes 1995: 300). In San’ani, however, the 
weight of CVC syllables is entirely dependent on the prosodic environment. I 
therefore conjecture that footing is enforced on the upper moraic layer if and only 
if there are underlyingly bimoraic syllables in a word; if not, footing is enforced 
on the lower moraic layer.
The proposed analysis accounts for the failure of superheavy CVCC syllables 
to be stressed if a non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syllable falls within the word. Consider 
the representations of dawwart ‘I/you m.s. looked for’ and sƒfart ‘I/you m.s. trav-
elled’ in (78).

In these examples, a disparity in sonority between the initial and penultimate syl-
lable exists on the upper moraic layer: the penultimate syllable has a single mora 
while the initial syllable has two moras. At this layer, a foot is constructed over 
the initial syllable, but no foot over the penultimate syllable. In both cases, stress 
is assigned to the initial syllable, the only visible foot. Stress assignment in daw-
wart and sƒfart is similar to that in other suﬃ  xed words which contain non-ﬁ nal 
CVV/CVG syllables. Consider the representations of dawwarnƒ ‘we looked for, 
he looked for us’ and jƒratnƒ ‘our neighbour f.’ in (79).
In these examples, a foot is constructed over the initial syllable and a second foot 
over the suﬃ  x -nƒ. The peripheral foot meets the conditions for extrametricality, 
and stress is assigned to the rightmost visible foot.
When the stressed syllable of a non-suﬃ  xed word is CV or CVC, stress does 
shift to the right on suﬃ  xation of a consonant-initial suﬃ  x. In this case, the

stressed syllable of the non-suﬃ  xed word is equally sonorous to the stressed syl-
lable of the suﬃ  xed word (bimoraic on the lower moraic layer only). Foot construc-
tion scans the upper moraic layer, and since no bimoraic syllables are attested at 
this layer, footing refers to the lower moraic layer. Stress is assigned to the syl-
lable in the stronger position (rightmost non-extrametrical). This is exempliﬁ ed in 
maktabkum ‘your m.pl. oﬃ  ce’ and gambart ‘I/you m.s. sat’, both of which are 
stressed on the leftmost syllable in their non-suﬃ  xed form—see (80a, b).
The parse of maktabkum ‘your m.pl. oﬃ  ce’ and gambart ‘I/you m.s. sat’ is similar 
to that of suﬃ  xed words with two adjacent CVV syllables such as j¤rƒnih ‘his 
neighbours’ and ¤gƒnuh ‘his/its m. windows’, in which the initial and penultimate 
syllables are equally sonorous (in this case, bimoraic on the upper layer). Once 
again, since the initial syllable does not enjoy greater sonority than the penultimate 
syllable, word stress is assigned to the syllable with the stronger (rightmost) pos-
ition:

5.4.1.3 Stress assignment in CVVC-ﬁ nal words
The present analysis does not, however, explain the stress patterns of words with 
a non-ﬁ nal CVV/CVG syllable ending in CVVC. Recall that words such as jazzƒr 
‘butcher’, ƒb¶n ‘soap’, mudarris¤n ‘teachers m.’, and xƒrij¤n ‘going out m.pl.’ are 
stressed on the leftmost CVV/CVG syllable. The reason for this stress pattern, I 
propose, lies in the fact that CVVC and CVCC syllables are not prosodically identi-
cal, a fact which has long been observed for a number of eastern dialects of Arabic 
including Classical Arabic (Bohas 1975 for Classical Arabic; Aoun 1979: 145 for 
Lebanese; Selkirk 1981: 214 for Cairene; Broselow 1992; Broselow et al. 1995, 
1997; Watson 1999c). The analysis below draws partly on work by Selkirk (1981), 
whereby CVVC syllables in Cairene are analysed as a single superheavy syllable, 
while CVCC syllables are analysed as a canonical syllable plus a degenerate syl-
lable, and partly on work by Broselow (1992) and Broselow et al. (1995, 1997).
In 1992, Broselow noted an asymmetry between CVVC and CVCC syllables in 
some dialects of Arabic (notably Sudanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Lebanese, and Gulf dia-
lects). In these dialects, it was seen that while CVVC syllables are not attested mor-
pheme-internally, they are attested in derived environments once subject suﬃ  xes 
(in the case of verbs with the perfect aspect template CVVCVC) and/or object or 
possessive suﬃ  xes (in the case of verbs or nouns with the template (CV)CVVC) 
are suﬃ  xed. Thus, in Lebanese, /kitƒb + na/ is realized as kitƒbna ‘our book’, 
whereas in Cairene and Alexandrian it is realized as kitabna (Broselow et al. 1995: 
129). In Sudanese, /mƒsik + ¤n/ is realized as mƒsk¤n, but as mask¤n in Cairene and 
Alexandrian. The syllable CVCC, by contrast, is never attested word-internally 
in any of these dialects. Similarly, in Standard Arabic, word-internal CVVC syl-
lables are the regular outcome of active participle formation from doubled (ﬁ nal 
geminate) roots (Wright 1971: 26) (case endings in round brackets):
(82) 
mƒdd(un) 
‘stretching’
 
mƒrr(un) 
‘passer-by’
 
fƒrr(un) 
‘fugitive’
 
lƒmma(tun) ‘evil eye’ (examples from Wehr’s dictionary)
Conversely, CVCC syllables are only ever attested word-ﬁ nally in Standard Arabic 
in low-style speech when ﬁ nal vowels and case markers are omitted (ﬁ nal vowels 
and case markers in round brackets):
(83) 
dars(un) 
‘lesson’
 
šarq(un) 
‘east’
 
katabt(a) ‘you m.s. wrote’
 
katabt(u) ‘I wrote’
In the discussion of San’ani syllable structure, we saw that while CVCC syllables 
are restricted to word-ﬁ nal position, CVVC syllables are optional in derived envir-
onments: ‘her book’ may be realized as either kitƒbhƒ or kitƒbahƒ (see Section 
4.4.1.3).

word stress
108
In order to account for word-internal CVVC syllables in derived environments, 
Broselow proposes an analysis whereby the ﬁ nal C is adjoined to the second 
mora of the long vowel (see Section 4.4.1.3). Later laboratory work demonstrat-
ed that the vowel of word-internal CVVC syllables is shorter than that of word-
internal CVV syllables, but longer than that of CVC syllables, thus supporting a 
bi moraic analysis of a three-element rhyme. For a Lebanese speaker, the vowel /ƒ/ 
in kitƒbna (97.8 msec) was shorter than /ƒ/ in kitƒbi (115.4 msec) but longer than 
/a/ in cinabna (65 msec) (Broselow et al. 1995, 1997).
CVVC syllables may diﬀ er from CVCC syllables, however, not only in word-
internal derived environments, but also word-ﬁ nally. In Standard Arabic, CVVC 
syllables may occur at the end of a poetic line and therefore participate in rhyme, 
but CVCC syllables are banned in this position (Bohas 1975, cited in Broselow 
1992: 16). In Cairene, CVVC syllables are attested phrase-ﬁ nally within the utter-
ance, but CVCC syllables induce epenthesis in all but utterance-ﬁ nal position, 
as in (84).
(84) 
kƒn hina ‘he was here’ but kunti hina ‘I was/you m.s. were here’
In Central Sudanese, CVVC syllables are attested word-ﬁ nally (as well as word-
internally), but CVCC syllables are attested word-ﬁ nally only where ﬁ nal gem-
inates are involved—see (85)—or in loan words ending in NC—as in (86) — 
(examples from Hamid 1984: 24).

umm 
‘mother’
 
jidd 
‘grandfather’
(86) 
bumb 
‘bomb’
 
bank 
‘bank’
 
tank 
‘tank’
Nouns which correspond to CVCC nouns in Standard Arabic and in a number of 
other modern dialects are otherwise realized as CVCiC in Sudanese, as in: isim 
‘name’ (cf. Cairene ism), iﬁ l ‘child’ (cf. Cairene iﬂ ), barid ‘cold’ (cf. Cairene 
bard). Verbs in the {ﬁ rst person singular} or {second person masculine singular} 
inﬂ ectional form in the perfect aspect are realized with ﬁ nal -a, as in: katabta 
‘I/you m.s. wrote’ (cf. Cairene katabt).
The stress pattern of words with ﬁ nal CVVC and non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syl-
lables in San’ani is attributable to the permissibility of CVVC syllables in pos-
itions in which CVCC syllables are not attested: just as the ﬁ nal C in CVVC 
syllables is analysed as the coda consonant word-internally in San’ani, it is ana-
lysed as a coda consonant in word-ﬁ nal CVVC syllables. The bimoraic analysis 
is maintained in word-ﬁ nal position, not through the Adjunction-to-Mora rule pro-
posed by Broselow for word-internal CVVC syllables, but through analysing the 
ﬁ nal consonant as extrametrical rather than extrasyllabic. Word-ﬁ nal CVVC is ana-
lysed as single bimoraic syllable with an extrametrical consonant which attaches 
directly to the syllable node, as in (87).

5.4 word stress in san’ani
109
Under this analysis, ﬁ nal CVVC forms a single peripheral bimoraic foot. Com-
bined with the moraic grid proposed above, the foot formed by word-ﬁ nal CVVC 
is eligible for extrametricality subject to the Nonexhaustivity Condition (see 
 Section 5.2.4)—that is, if and only if other bimoraic syllables on the upper moraic 
layer occur in the word. In the derivations of ƒb¶n ‘soap’ and jazzƒr ‘butcher’ 
in (88a, b), two bimoraic feet are constructed on the upper moraic layer. The periph-
eral foot is rendered extrametrical, and stress is assigned to the rightmost visible 
foot.
These examples compare with a word such as makt¶b ‘letter’ in which the penul-
timate syllable is CVC and the ﬁ nal syllable CVVC: the disparity in sonority 
between the penultimate and ﬁ nal syllable is seen on the upper layer where the 
ﬁ nal syllable is bimoraic and the initial one monomoraic. On the upper moraic 
layer, a foot is constructed over the ﬁ nal CVVC syllable, but no foot over the 
penultimate syllable. Foot extrametricality fails to apply since extrametricality 
would render the word footless at the upper layer, and stress is assigned to ﬁ nal 
CVVC—see (89).

5.4.2 Domain-ﬁ nal CVV
The proposed two-layer moraic analysis provides us with a partial explanation for 
the problematic stress pattern of trisyllabic and quadrisyllabic words ending in 
CVV. In words with the template CVCCVCVV, CVCCVV, and CVCVV, stress is 
assigned to the domain-ﬁ nal CVV syllable (see Section 5.4):
(90) yiktub¶ ‘they m. write’
 
yif  cal¶ 
‘they m. do’
 
yištaw 
‘they m. want’
 
ar¤ 
‘fresh’
In verbs with an antepenultimate or penultimate CVV or CVG syllable, however, 
stress is placed on the CVV or CVG syllable:
(91) yiibb¶ ‘they m. like’
 
bazz¶ 
‘they m. took’
 
sƒfar¶ 
‘they m. travelled’
And in quadrisyllabic words and in trisyllabic words with the template CVCVCVV, 
stress is placed on the leftmost light syllable:11
(92) 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’
 
yixtalif¶ 
‘they m. diﬀ er’
 
kutub¤ 
‘my books’
In the case of yiktub¶ forms, foot construction scans the upper moraic layer. A 
foot is constructed over ﬁ nal CVV, the only underlyingly bimoraic syllable. Since 
no other feet are constructed at this layer, ERR assigns stress to the head of the 
only foot—see (93).

The analysis of forms with antepenultimate or penultimate CVV or CVG syllables 
and ﬁ nal CVV, such as bazz¶ ‘they m. took’, is similar to that of words with the 
template CVVCVVC and CVGGVVC. The two-layered moraic grid reveals two 
equally sonorous bimoraic syllables. Two feet are constructed at the upper moraic 
layer rendering the peripheral (CVV) syllable eligible for extrametricality. Stress 
is assigned to the rightmost visible foot according to ERR:
The analysis of words with antepenultimate and penultimate CV syllables, such as 
maktabat¤ ‘my library’ and katab¶ ‘they m. wrote’, considered at the beginning 
of Section 5.4, is no less straightforward. Foot construction scans the upper moraic 
layer and creates two feet. In both cases, the penultimate foot is equally sonorous 
to the ﬁ nal foot—both feet comprise two moras on each of the moraic layers. The 
ﬁ nal foot is eligible for extrametricality, and stress is assigned to the head of the 
rightmost visible foot, the antepenultimate syllable. This is exempliﬁ ed in the rep-
resentation of katab¶ ‘they m. wrote’.

5.4.3 Sufﬁ xed words with pre-antepenultimate CVV or CVG syllables
The two-layered moraic grid on its own is insuﬃ  cient to explain the stress assign-
ment of suﬃ  xed words in which the pre-antepenultimate syllable is either CVV 
or CVG. Where a word with an antepenultimate CVV or CVG syllable takes a suf-
ﬁ x, stress fails to shift from the CVV or CVG syllable in the suﬃ  xed form and 
this word is stressed on the pre-antepenultimate syllable, as in hƒkaahƒ ‘like this’ 
and musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’. This contrasts with suﬃ  xed words in which the 
pre-antepenultimate syllable is CVC, as in maktabat¤ ‘my library’. A two-layered 
moraic grid alone would not allow stress to be assigned further left than the ante-
penultimate syllable:
Forms such as hƒkaahƒ ‘like this’ and musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’ demonstrate 
that a foot constructed over a CVV/CVG syllable is more prominent than a foot 
comprising two light syllables, and that a CVV/CVG syllable will take precedence 
even where this does not constitute the rightmost visible foot. The relative promi-
nence of CVV/CVG syllables can be accounted for by adding a prominence com-
ponent to the grid. A prominence grid was proposed by Hayes (1995: 284) to 
account for the optional stress of initial heavy syllables in words with the template 
VCCVCVCVC such as ankitalaw in Negev Bedouin Arabic. In San’ani, however, 
reference must also be made to the upper layer of the two-layer moraic grid in 
order to prevent the prominence grid singling out non-ﬁ nal CVC syllables as prom-
inent. The prominence grid is constructed on the basis of the following Promi-
nence Projection:
(97) 
Prominence Projection
 
Project a prominence grid as follows:
 
 **: heavy syllables (CVV/CVG)
 
 *: light syllables (CV/CVC)
We then apply ERR to derive the correct results. Consider the derivation of 
musajjilat¤ ‘my recorder’ in (98).

5.4 word stress in san’ani
113
In the majority of Arabic dialects, non-domain-ﬁ nal CVC and CVV/CVG syl-
lables are treated as prosodically identical heavy syllables. In San’ani, however, 
CVC syllables are treated as heavy if and only if not adjacent to a non-ﬁ nal CVV 
or CVG syllable and, in contrast to CVV/CVG syllables, fail to retract stress from 
domain-ﬁ nal CVVC or CVCC. The dual nature of CVC syllables in this dialect is 
accounted for by a two-layer analysis of sonority: underlyingly moraic segments 
have a mora on each moraic layer, while segments which are assigned a mora by 
the Weight-by-Position condition have a mora on the lower layer only. Foot con-
struction scans the upper moraic layer in the ﬁ rst instance, looking at the lower 
moraic layer if and only if bimoraic syllables are not attested at the upper layer. 
This analysis sheds light on the stress of words ending in CVCC: an underlyingly 
bimoraic syllable to the left of CVCC attracts stress since the CVV/CVG syllable 
will form the only foot on the upper moraic layer; where a CVC syllable falls to 
the left of CVCC, by contrast, both syllables are monomoraic on the upper moraic 
layer and bimoraic on the lower layer. The foot parse refers to the lower moraic 
layer and stress is assigned by ERR to the rightmost foot. The two-layer analysis 
also provides an explanation of asymmetrical stress patterns of words which end 
in a long vowel: stress is assigned to the ﬁ nal foot if and only if two binary feet can-

not be constructed on the upper moraic layer. If the word has two equally sonorous 
feet, the foot constructed over the ﬁ nal long vowel is eligible for extrametricality 
and the head of the penultimate foot is stressed according to ERR.12
The failure of domain-ﬁ nal CVVC to attract stress when a CVV or CVG syl-
lable occurs in the word is attributed to the permissibility of CVVC syllables in 
positions in which CVCC syllables are not attested. Following Broselow (1992) 
and Broselow et al.’s (1995, 1997) bimoraic analysis of word-internal CVVC syl-
lables in several Arabic dialects and Selkirk’s (1981) analysis of domain-ﬁ nal 
CVVC as a single superheavy syllable, the domain-ﬁ nal behaviour of CVVC syl-
lables is attributed to an extrametrical rather than an extrasyllabic analysis of the 
ﬁ nal C. Word-ﬁ nally, a CVVC sequence is analysed as a single bimoraic syllable 
which forms a peripheral foot. Where a ﬁ nal CVVC syllable occurs in the same 
word as an equally sonorous CVV/CVG syllable, it is eligible for extrametricality 
by virtue of satisfying both the Peripherality Condition and the Nonexhaustivity 
Condition.
The two-layer moraic grid analysis does not, on its own, provide an account of 
the stress of suﬃ  xed words in which a pre-antepenultimate CVV/CVG syllable is 
stressed. For cases such as these I propose that a prominence component is added 
to the grid as suggested by Hayes for the analysis of optional initial stress in words 
with the template VCCVCVCVC in Negev Bedouin Arabic.
5.4.4 Stress ﬂ uctuation
The word-stress rules discussed above hold for the stress of words in isolation and, 
in the main, for the stress of words which do not have particular prominence within 
the utterance. In contrast to Cairene, however, San’ani is subject to signiﬁ cant 
stress ﬂ uctuation in connected speech. Stress ﬂ uctuation may be due to one of four 
factors: the optionality of foot extrametricality, stress migration within the foot, a 
weak prohibition on degenerate feet, and optional mora extrametricality.13
5.4.4.1 Failure of foot extrametricality
In the majority of Arabic dialects, foot extrametricality either applies or does 
not apply. In Egyptian radio Arabic, foot extrametricality appears to be optional 
(Hayes 1995: 131). In San’ani, foot extrametricality applies invariably when the 
word occurs in isolation, but may fail to apply in connected speech. In words 
with ﬁ nal and ante/penultimate long vowels or a ﬁ nal long vowel and an ante/
penultimate CVG syllable, foot extrametricality excludes the ﬁ nal foot from stress 
assignment, as seen above, and repeated here as (99).
12 More research is needed on the working of the two-layered moraic grid in San’ani. It appears to 
be necessary only where underlyingly bimoraic syllables are attested in a word. When the word ends 
in two short (CV) syllables, as in maktabih ‘library’, it is not invoked (if it were, the peripheral foot 
would constitute the only foot in the word and the penultimate syllable would be stressed).
13 Standard Arabic words in Cairene are argued to have optional Mora Extrametricality, although 
doubts have been expressed about the descriptive validity of Mora Extrametricality (Hayes 1995: 69).

5.4 word stress in san’ani
115
Where foot extrametricality does not hold, however, the ﬁ nal foot is open to stress 
assignment through ERR, and stress is assigned to the ﬁ nal syllable:
In quadrisyllabic words comprising four light syllables or trisyllabic words com-
prising a heavy syllable followed by two light syllables, the two ﬁ nal light syl-
lables form a peripheral foot which is extrametrical in regular word stress, as 
exempliﬁ ed in darasatih ‘she learnt it m.’ and maktabih ‘his oﬃ  ce’. When foot 
extrametricality fails to apply in connected speech, however, stress is placed on 
the head of the peripheral foot by ERR to give darasatih ‘she learnt it m.’ and 
maktabih ‘his oﬃ  ce’;14 see (101).
5.4.4.2 Stress migration
In form VII and form VIII verbs with the template (C)VCCVCVC and words with 
the template CVCVC, stress often shifts from the penultimate to the ﬁ nal syllable 
(see Section 4.4.2.2). This is particularly the case in pre-pausal position. When 
stress shift occurs, the destressed vowel in the penultimate syllable is frequently 
subject to syncope, as in the examples in (102).

In words with the template CVCVCVC, stress may shift from the initial to the

ktabat 
‘she wrote’
In all these cases, stress migrates rightwards to the adjacent syllable within the 
foot and the destressed vowel is optionally subject to syncope (represented in (104) 
as 0).
Hayes notes a similar process of stress migration in his analysis of data from a 
number of other conservative dialects of Arabic (Bani-Hassan Bedouin, Tripoli, 
Bedouin Hijazi, Cyrenaican Bedouin, and the semi-nomadic dialect of al-‘Ajarma; 
cf. Palva 1976: 24) (Hayes 1995: 42; cf. Kager 1995: 387–8). In these cases, how-
ever, stress migration is invariably accompanied by syncope of the destressed 
vowel. For these dialects, Hayes assumes it is the strong vowel which is subject to 
deletion and that strong vowel deletion occasions stress migration.
The examples of stress migration given here for San’ani and in Hayes for other 
conservative dialects of Arabic demonstrate that the direction of migration can 
be predicted from the bracketed grid: stress marks may not move outside a brack-
eted domain. In a language with initially stressed feet, such as San’ani, stress 
migrates to the right; in a language with ﬁ nally stressed feet, such as Cyrenaican 
Bedouin Arabic, stress migrates to the left. In all cases, the theory predicts that 
stress migrates within the foot.
5.4.4.3 Stress of degenerate feet
The status of degenerate feet and the eﬀ ect of pause in San’ani was discussed 
earlier in this chapter. As examples have shown, not all sub-minimal elements 
are parsed as degenerate feet. Degenerate feet are formed only when adjacent to 
pause, following the deﬁ nite article and after the ﬁ rst term of a genitive phrase 
(cf. Section 5.1.2). Consider the following post-pause (105a) and pre-pause (105b) 
 examples.

‘[proper name]’
I assume these stress patterns result from the dialect’s optional weak prohibition 
on degenerate feet, which is stated in (106).
(106) Weak prohibition on degenerate feet
 
 Foot parsing may form degenerate feet only in strong position—that is, 
when dominated by another grid mark.
Rule (106) says that degenerate feet are permitted only when dominated by a grid 
mark of the word layer and thus assigned stress. Degenerate feet which are not 
assigned a grid mark at the word layer are removed. According to Hayes, degener-
ate feet are formed when the foot parse leaves only enough material to form a 
degenerate foot. Thus, in a language in which feet are formed from right to left 
degenerate feet are predicted to be formed at the left edge, and in a language 
in which feet are formed from left to right (as in San’ani) the theory predicts 
that degenerate feet will be formed at the right edge. This accounts for the pre-
pausal degenerate feet in words such as yuxla ‘he mixes’ and aflih ‘party’. The 
latter is exempliﬁ ed in (107).
The foot parse creates a foot over the leftmost syllable; a degenerate foot is con-
structed from the remaining material. ERR assigns stress to the degenerate foot 
which survives to the surface by virtue of being dominated by a word layer grid 
mark.
In words which end in a consonant other than /h/, the degenerate foot may be 
repaired (i.e. made into a canonical foot) through vowel lengthening, as in yuxla: 
‘he mixes’ and ama:d ‘Ahmad’ (see Section 5.1.2). In words which end in /h/—
most notably the /h/ of the feminine suﬃ  x -ih—the vowel of the preceding foot is 
usually deleted when short, to add prominence to the stressed degenerate foot, as 
in škmih ‘lunch party for parturient’ and ﬂ ih ‘party’ (see Section 4.4.2.3).
In post-pause position, initial syllables are often stressed irrespective of their 
weight. I consider assignment of stress to an initial CV syllable in words with 
the template CVCVVC to be a further consequence of both the weak prohibition 
on degenerate feet in San’ani (see (61b)), and the analysis of CVVC as a single 
bimoraic syllable. If this analysis is correct, however, San’ani provides a counter-

example to Hayes’s claim that degenerate feet are constructed at the right edge 
only when the direction of the foot parse is left to right, and at the left edge only 
when the direction of the foot parse is right to left. Hayes proposes that ‘When 
candidates for degenerate foot status are encountered other than at the end of the 
parse, they are skipped over’ (Hayes 1995: 95). San’ani, however, appears to con-
struct degenerate feet not only at the end of the parse, but also at the beginning of 
the parse. The post-pause/pre-pause position is in mirror-image relation, and adja-
cency to pause is a crucial factor in the formation of degenerate feet in this dialect. 
In post-pause position, the initial syllable is placed in strong position irrespective 
of the structure of the following syllable. Consider the representation of tamƒm 
‘okay’.
An initial degenerate foot is formed. The ﬁ nal CVVC syllable forms a second foot. 
The second foot is rendered extrametrical, and ERR assigns stress to the degener-
ate foot.
5.4.4.4 Mora extrametricality
A non-geminate verb in the imperfect aspect with a long vowel suﬃ  x is most likely 
to be stressed on the ﬁ nal CVV syllable, as in yif  cal¶ ‘they m. do’ (cf. (8e)). In 
connected speech, however, the word can also be stressed on either of the other 
two syllables, as in yif  cal¶ ‘they m. do’ and yifcal¶ ‘they m. do’. The derivation 
of the predicted form, which depends on reference to the two-layer moraic grid, is 
repeated here for convenience.
Neither of the alternative forms make reference to the two-layer moraic grid. The 
ﬁ rst alternative, yif  cal¶, is derived as in (110), with extrametricality of the periph-
eral foot.
In the second alternative, stress is assigned to the only light syllable in the word 
to give yifcal¶ ‘they m. do’. Here mora extrametricality occurs rendering the ﬁ nal 
syllable of the word monomoraic. Foot construction creates a foot over the initial

heavy syllable and a second foot over the ﬁ nal two (now light) syllables. Foot 
extrametricality fails to apply. ERR assigns stress to the head of the rightmost foot, 
the penultimate syllable.
5.4.5 Secondary stress
In contrast to Cairene, San’ani exhibits secondary stress in words comprising two 
or more binary feet. Secondary stress is determined by a combination of the rhyth-
mic principle and the stress algorithm: in a word with two binary feet, secondary 
stress is determined purely by the stress algorithm (that is, by foot construction): in 
a three/four-syllable word with a ﬁ nal CVVC syllable and a heavy syllable (CVV 
or CVG), either the ﬁ nal CVVC or the non-ﬁ nal CVV or CVG syllable receives 
main stress (subject to the application or non-application of foot extrametricality) 
while the other heavy syllable receives secondary stress (in the following diagrams 
only the heads of binary feet are marked):
In a word with a simple CVC heavy syllable and a penultimate CVV syllable, main 
stress will be assigned to the penultimate CVV syllable, while secondary stress is

assigned to the simple heavy syllable (CVC), to give yiba ¶hin ‘they m. slaugh-
ter them f.’ (where  denotes a following secondarily stressed syllable):
In words with two disyllabic binary feet, such as katabatih ‘she wrote it m.’ and 
darasatih ‘she learnt it m.’, main stress and secondary stress are determined by 
the stress algorithm, and ﬂ uctuations are accounted for by the optionality of foot 
extrametricality. Main stress is assigned to the initial syllable if foot extrametrical-
ity holds, with secondary stress on the penultimate syllable to give an alternating 
S w s w pattern. When foot extrametricality does not hold, the pattern is reversed 
and main stress is placed on the penultimate syllable with secondary stress on the 
initial syllable to give s w S w, as in (114).

The alternative stress patterns of katabatih ‘she wrote it m.’ are given in (115).
In words with four binary feet, a further supra-foot, sub-word rhythmic level de-
termines the location of secondary stress by creating a sequence of stressed and 
unstressed feet. In a word such as mustašfayƒt ‘hospitals’, in which primary 
stress is invariably assigned to the rightmost foot, secondary stress is assigned to 
the penultimate foot. In a word such as tiliviziy¶nƒt ‘televisions’ with ﬁ nal and 
penultimate long vowels, secondary stress is assigned to the head of the leftmost 
foot if primary stress is located on the penultimate foot, as in (116a). If primary 
stress is assigned to the rightmost foot due to the failure of foot extrametricality, 
secondary stress is assigned to the head of the antepenultimate foot, as in (116b).

5.5 conclusion
121
In Cairene there is no rhythmic level and foot construction appears to serve purely 
as a computational device—it is crucial to determine main stress placement, but 
the feet are not reﬂ ected in secondary stress (cf. Hayes 1995: 119). For Cairene 
either the phonetic and phonological rules do not provide any means of manifest-
ing foot structure, or feet are removed by a phonological rule which Halle and 
Vergnaud term ‘conﬂ ation’ (Halle and Vergnaud 1987: 50). Halle and Kenstowicz 
(1991: 462, repeated in Hayes 1995: 119) provide the following version of con-
ﬂ ation:

5.5 CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have examined the word-stress systems of Cairene and San’ani. 
Both dialects are independently demonstrated to have moraic trochee systems. Dif-
ferences between stress assignment in Cairene and San’ani are partially attribut-
able to the fact that Cairene lacks foot extrametricality. Cairene also invariably 
assigns stress to the penultimate syllable when the perfect verb in the {third person 
feminine singular} inﬂ ectional form takes an object suﬃ  x and in the case of plu-
rals of the patterns CiCiCa and CuCuCa. I argue that these exceptional stress pat-
terns are lexicalized and not derivable from the rules given in (45), and conjecture 
that they are a vestige of an earlier stage in the development of Cairene. Further dif-
ferences between the San’ani and Cairene stress sytems are attributed to a prosodic 
diﬀ erence in San’ani between CVC syllables and CVG/CVV syllables; to stress 
ﬂ uctuation in San’ani brought about by the optional failure of foot extrametricality 
in connected speech, stress migration within the foot, a weak prohibition on degen-
erate feet and optional mora extrametricality; and to a lack of secondary stress in 
Cairene.
I have concentrated on word stress in San’ani for two reasons. First, in phono-
logical literature far less is known about word stress in San’ani than in Cairene; 
and secondly, San’ani poses more challenges for a theory about word stress than 
most other modern dialects of Arabic, particularly in terms of the privilige of word-
internal CVV and CVG syllables, and the degree of attested ﬂ uctuation of stress in 
connected speech.

MORPHOLOGY
Morphology deals with the way in which words are constructed. Morphology also 
accounts for morphological variation—that is, allomorphy. Within a phonologic-
al framework, morphology is important insofar as certain phonological rules are 
sensitive to morphological structure and are restricted to applying within speciﬁ c 
derived morphological domains, while other phonological rules are insensitive to 
morphological structure. For example, coronal plosive voicing in San’ani requires 
no morphological speciﬁ cation and applies whenever a coronal plosive occurs in 
intervocalic or word-initial position (see Section 9.2.7).

Similarly, geminate voiced nonsonorant stops are devoiced in San’ani irrespective 
of whether the geminate is derived (as in the last two examples) or underlying:

By contrast, in both Cairene and San’ani, the anticipatory assimilation of /l/ to a 
coronal obstruent (and optionally to a velar plosive in Cairene) occurs only where 
/l/ belongs to the deﬁ nite article (il- in Cairene, al- in San’ani) (see also Section 
8.2.2).

When /l/ and a contiguous coronal obstruent (or velar plosive in Cairene) belong to 
the same morpheme—that is, to the consonantal root—assimilation does not take 
place, as in the examples in (4).

Similarly, when a coronal obstruent (or a velar plosive in Cairene) is preceded by

does not take place. (5a) provides examples of initial root /l/ followed by inﬁ x

This interaction between the morphology and the phonology can only be repre-
sented by a theory which takes into account the morphological structure of words 
and which states, as part of its tenets, that certain phonological processes only 
apply in speciﬁ c derived environments. Thus, the total anticipatory assimilation of 
/l/ to a coronal obstruent (or velar plosive in Cairene) only occurs when /l/ belongs 
to the deﬁ nite article, and in no other case. In order to appreciate the role of morph-
ology within the phonology of Arabic, we need to posit a satisfactory description 
of Arabic morphology. This is the aim of this and the following chapter.

morphology
124
6.1 THE MORPHEME
The basic unit of morphology is the morpheme. Languages diﬀ er in the means by 
which morphemes are linked into words. In isolating languages such as Classic al 
Chinese, a sentence comprises a sequence of monosyllables, each of which is a 
grammatical unit and few are divisible into smaller units of the same kind (Mat-
thews 1991: 206). Such a language could be said to have no morphology, since all 
morphology is reducible to the domain of syntax. The morphological systems of 
many other languages in which words are clearly divisible into morphemes can be 
predominantly seen as word-syntax. That is to say, morphemes can be added as pre-
ﬁ xes or suﬃ  xes to a basic stem. In this type of system, each individual morpheme 
can usually be identiﬁ ed as an isolatable whole, even where sounds at morpheme 
boundaries may have changed. On the whole, this is the case with English. Con-
sider the morphological composition of the following words (morphemes deline-
ated by square brackets):
(6) (a) [sense]n.[less]neg.adj.[ness]n.
 
(b) [un]neg.[believ]v.[able]adj.
In (6a) the stem of the word is the noun [sense]; the morpheme [less] negates 
[sense] and converts it into an adjective; the morpheme [ness] then converts the 
adjective [senseless] back into a noun. In (6b) the stem of the word is the verb 
[believe]; the morpheme [able] converts [believe] into the adjective [believable]; 
the morpheme [un] then negates the positive adjective [believable], but does not 
aﬀ ect the syntactic class of the word.
However, even in languages which have a predominantly agglutinative morpho-
logical system, it is not always possible to isolate the separate morphemes of what 
appears to be a morphologically complex word. In English, a number of plurals are 
created by ablaut—by changing one of the vowels of the singular, as in (7).
(7) 
 
 
Ablaut also occurs with verb forms in English. The word took comprises the verb 
[take] plus the vowel [u] to represent past tense (Spencer 1991: 49–50). There are 
a large number of other exceptions to the agglutinative morphology of English, 
some of which come from old loan words: the nouns [goose], [tooth], and [foot] all 
take a vestige of earlier German umlaut in the plural to give geese, teeth, and feet. 
These are the only three items in the lexicon which have this umlaut; therefore the 
roots themselves have to be marked with a diacritic to trigger ‘umlaut’ in the plural 
(Spencer 1991: 101).

6.2 root-and-pattern morphology
125
6.2 ROOT-AND-PATTERN MORPHOLOGY
In some languages, a great deal more morphological categories are expressed by 
morphemes which, like the ‘umlaut’ and ablaut examples in English, are not easily 
isolatable into separate phonological forms. In these languages, morphological cat-
egories are expressed by morphemes whose only constant is a ﬁ xed canonical pat-
tern. The most common morphological process of this type is reduplication, which 
is attested in a large number of the world’s languages (Spencer 1991: 150–6). In 
reduplication, part or whole of a basic stem is reduplicated and may be preﬁ xed, 
suﬃ  xed or inﬁ xed in the stem to produce a derived word. In Palan Koryak (Žukova 
1980: 42–3, cited in Spencer 1991: 150), the ﬁ rst CVC unit of the word is redupli-
cated and suﬃ  xed in the reduplicated word:
(8) (a) Stem

wiru 
wiru-wir 
‘seal’
 
 
li 
li-li 
‘heart’
 
 
jie 
jie-ji 
‘mist’
In Samoan (Broselow and McCarthy 1983: 30, cited in Spencer 1991: 151, 154–5), 
the initial consonant and ﬁ rst mora of the metrical foot is reduplicated and preﬁ xed 
to the ﬁ rst consonant of the foot:
 
(b) Stem 
Reduplicated word

taa 
ta-taa

nofo 
no-nofo 
‘sit’
 
 
alofa 
a-lo-lofa 
‘love’
 
 
maliu ma-li-liu 
‘die’
More complicated than reduplication is the Semitic templatic root-and-pattern 
morphology of content words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) and non-minimal 
prepositions and adverbs (as in Arabic cind ‘at, with’, calƒ ‘on, against’, ʔay	an 
‘also’, jiddan ‘very’). In these languages, various morphological distinctions are 
expressed by specifying a ﬁ xed canonical form (a pattern) of the stem which 
does not vary irrespective of the quality of the root consonants or the intercalated 
vowels. The root-and-pattern morphology of Arabic is most commonly described 
using examples of derivational verbs. The triliteral verb form II, which often 
imposes a causative or intensive sense on the basic form I verb, has the stem pat-
tern CVCCVC with a geminate middle radical. In Standard Arabic, the imperfect 
is formed by changing the quality of the rightmost stem vowel and adding an imper-
fect preﬁ x (ʔu- {ﬁ rst person singular}, yu- {third person masculine}, tu- {second/
third feminine singular}, nu- {ﬁ rst person plural}). The passive is formed by a 
change in the vocalic melody.

6.3 NON-CONCATENATIVE MORPHOLOGY
The stem of a content word in Arabic has three discontinuous morphemes: the 
consonantal root, which is the fundamental lexical unit of the language ( McCarthy 
and Prince 1990a: 2); the templatic pattern into which the consonantal root is 
inserted imposing an additional meaning to that of the root; and the intercalated 
vowels—the vocalic melody—which mark variations in, for example, the voice 
(active or passive) in verbs, agentive relations in nouns derived from verbs, and 
singular–plural relations in nouns. In short, the Arabic lexicon comprises the mor-
pheme types in (10), the ﬁ rst three of which are present in basic stems (cf. Section 
6.4.2; Moore 1990: 64).
(10) (a) Templates: the bare prosodic material.
 
(b) Roots: the consonantal melody units.
 
(c) Vocalism: the vocalic melody units.
 
(d) Aﬃ  xes: which may consist of both prosodic and melodic units.
Traditional analyses of morphology in which words are decomposed into a series 
of internal boundary elements that delimit the constituent morphemes are unable to 
account for the discontinuous morphemes attested in Semitic languages.  McCarthy 
(1981) proposes that, on analogy with autosegmental phonology, each morpho-
logical unit is linked by lines of association to some of the phonological material 
in the form. The morpheme is usually represented as µ on the morphemic tier. In 
early Nonconcatentive Morphology, the basic templatic pattern of a word is repre-
sented by a sequence of empty timing tier entities notated as Cs and Vs (cf. Section 
4.1); the consonantal root as a sequence of consonants; and the vocalic melody as 
a sequence of vowels. Association of melody elements with elements of the skel-
etal template is restricted by the Universal Association Convention of phonology, 
repeated from Section 4.1 for convenience:
(11) Universal Association Convention
 
 Associate autosegments and autosegment-bearing units one to one, left to 
right.
The UAC ensures that elements of the consonantal root and the vocalic melody 
associate on a one-to-one basis from left to right to appropriate elements of the 
skeletal template. San’ani wujid ‘he/it m. was found’ comprises the consonantal 
root /w-j-d/, the passive vocalic melody /u-i/, and the skeletal template of the per-
fect aspect, CVCVC, as in (12).

6.3 non-concatenative morphology
127
In order to arrive at a pronounceable string of segments, the morphological tiers 
are linearized by a process known as Tier Conﬂ ation (McCarthy 1986, after 
Younes 1983), through which the C and V melodies are folded onto a single tier:
The combination of the morphemes {‘ﬁ nd’}, {perfect}, and {passive} with no 
additional information for person gives the form wujid ‘he/it m. was found’.
In contrast to stems, aﬃ  xes are represented as combined prosodic and melodic 
units with the consonants and vowels on the same tier since there is no evidence for 
the separation of Cs and Vs in aﬃ  xes (cf. Spencer 1991: 148). Thus, the underlying 
representation of San’ani wujidat ‘she/it f. was found’ is in (14).
In a phonological word comprising a stem and aﬃ  x(es), a pronounceable linear 
string of segments is reached by Tier Conﬂ ation operating ﬁ rst to fold together 
Cs and Vs of the stem, as in (15a), and then to fold in the remaining aﬃ  xes, as 
in (15b).
Association is subject to the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP), initially pro-
posed by Leben (1973) to deal with problems of tonal speciﬁ cation and refor-
mulated by McCarthy (1979a, 1981, 1986) to deal with general tier-internal 
representations:

(16) Obligatory Contour Principle
 
In a given autosegmental tier, adjacent autosegments are prohibited.
Successive speciﬁ cation of identical elements is banned by the OCP: in stems end-
ing in two identical adjacent consonants such as San’ani agg ‘right, possession, 
belonging to’, the consonantal melody is given as /g/. In stems with two identical 
vowels, as in katab ‘he wrote’, the vocalic melody is given as a single vowel, /a/. 
Association of the melody with the skeletal template takes place from left to right 
on a one-to-one basis in accordance with the UAC; where the number of templatic 
positions exceeds the number of melodic elements, the rightmost element of the 
melody spreads rightwards to ﬁ ll any unﬁ lled templatic positions (cf. Section 4.1). 
The representation and association of agg ‘right, possession’ is as in (17).
The representation and association of katab ‘he wrote’ is as in (18).
In contrast to the consonantal melody, the vocalic melody is only partially inde-
pendent of the template and the consonantal melody: /u-i/ marks the passive voice 
in the perfect aspect in Standard Arabic and San’ani; however, in other cases, a 
particular vocalic melody is associated with a particular template: CVVCVC par-
ticiples and plurals of the patterns CVCVVCV(V)C take the melody /a-i/, nouns of 
instrument of the template mV+CCVVC the melody /i-a/ (/u-a/ in Cairene); and 
in nouns of the template CVCC, the vocalic melody is lexically stipulated, /a/, /u/, 
or /i/, as exempliﬁ ed in the San’ani words agg ‘right’, guﬂ  ‘lock’, and tibn ‘straw’ 
(cf. Kenstowicz 1994: 636).
6.4 PROSODIC MORPHOLOGY
In recent years, work in phonology has demonstrated that there was little or no 
evidence for the segment-sized units of CV or X-slot skeleton theory (McCarthy 
and Prince 1990a: 5). Evidence did, however, clearly remain for templatic patterns 
to deal with both reduplication in languages and non-concatenative morphologic-
al systems. Building on work from Prosodic Phonology (Selkirk 1980, among 
others), McCarthy and Prince (1986, 1988, 1990a, 1990b) developed a model of

6.4 prosodic morphology
129
 Prosodic Morphology within which they demonstrate that the categories relevant 
for templatic morphology are precisely those made available by prosodic theory 
in general, including the mora, the syllable, the foot, and the phonological word 
(Hayes 1995: 47). This meant that the notions applicable to the templates were 
now identical to those notions applicable to prosody in general—including stress, 
syllabiﬁ cation, epenthesis, compensatory lengthening, rhyme, and poetic metre 
(McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 3). The three fundamental theses of Prosodic Mor-
phology are summed up in (19).
(19) (a)  Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis. Templates are deﬁ ned in terms of 
the authentic units of prosody: mora (µ), syllable (ª), foot (F), phono-
logical word (
), and so on.
 
(b)  Template Satisfaction Condition. Satisfaction of templatic constraints 
is obligatory and is determined by the principles of prosody, both uni-
versal and language-speciﬁ c.
 
(c)  Prosodic Circumscription of Domains. The domain to which morpho-
logical operations apply may be circumscribed by prosodic criteria as 
well as by the more familiar morphological ones. In particular, the 
min imal word within a domain may be selected as the locus of mor-
phological transformation in lieu of the whole domain (McCarthy and 
Prince 1990b: 209–10).
The prosodic template is read in terms of the Prosodic Hierarchy in (20) (from 
Selkirk 1980).
(20) Prosodic Hierarchy
 
Foot 
F
 
Syllable 
ª
 
Mora 
µ
The Prosodic Hierarchy is read from top to bottom such that each higher element 
contains at least one unit from the element immediately below: thus, the minimal 
phonological word comprises a foot, the minimum foot comprises a syllable, and 
the minimum syllable comprises a mora. The phonological word (
) usually, but 
not necessarily, coincides with the syntactic word (cf. Section 4.4).
6.4.1 The minimal word
Since the word dominates the foot in the prosodic hierarchy, the minimal word will 
be a single foot: in a quantitative trochaic stress system as exhibited by Cairene 
and San’ani, the minimal word is a quantitative (moraic) foot.1
1 In iambic systems, the minimal word will be the minimal iamb, i.e. any iamb which satisﬁ es foot 
binarity. No language can demand a minimal word comprising a light followed by a heavy syllable 
(McCarthy and Prince 1995: 323).

Since (21) is expressed in terms of moraic content and not in terms of syllables, 
the minimal word is predicted to comprise either a single bimoraic syllable, or a 
sequence of two monomoraic syllables (cf. Section 5.2.2), as in (22).
6.4.2 Basic stems
The word stem is an important concept in Arabic, and will be referred to several 
times during the course of this and the following chapters. The stem is deﬁ ned 
here as the bare word prior to the aﬃ  xation of any suﬃ  xes or preﬁ xes, but after 
any stem-internal changes. For example, katabat ‘she wrote’ comprises the stem 
katab and the subject marker suﬃ  x -at; ummak ‘your m.s. mother’ comprises the 
stem umm and the possessive pronoun suﬃ  x -ak; San’ani yibsirak ‘he sees you 
m.s.’ comprises the stem bsir, the subject marker preﬁ x yi- and the object suﬃ  x 
-ak; and San’ani taammam ‘he bathes’ comprises the stem ammam and the form 
V/VI detransitivizing preﬁ x ta-.2 Within the Prosodic Hierarchy, the stem comes 
between the foot and the phonological word. However, the stem may not be inde-
pendently syllabiﬁ able, as in the case of the stem of yibsirak ‘he sees you m.s.’.
An important prediction of Prosodic Morphology is that the basic stems of con-
tent words in Arabic will comprise complete feet—at least one foot and at most 
two feet. Therefore the composition and size of the basic stem is ruled by a com-
bination of two constraints: the Minimal Word Constraint, which ensures that the 
minimal stem is bimoraic (see Section 6.4.1), and the language-speciﬁ c Maximal 
Stem Constraint (McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 25), stated in (23).
(23) Maximal Stem Constraint
 
Templates are maximally disyllabic.
While the stress systems of Cairene and San’ani are trochaic (see Section 5.2.2), a 
large number of basic single-foot words are based on the canonical iambic foot—a

2 In modern Arabic dialects, the {third person masculine singular} form of the perfect verb is usu-
ally isomorphic with the perfect stem. Thus, katab ‘he wrote’ is the same as the stem of katabat ‘she 
wrote’, and San’ani gambar ‘he sat’ the same as the stem of gambarayn ‘they f. sat’.

logical processes are also based on the iambic foot: the diminutive and the most 
productive broken plural patterns (cf. Section 6.6).
The following nominal stem-types are attested in the Arabic dialects under dis-
cussion (cf. McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 32 for Standard Arabic). A word which 
is exclusive to either Cairene or San’ani is followed by the abbreviation (CA) 
or (SA).

Words which comprise more than one foot but less than two, such as the form 
I active participle and the stem of the form III verb, which share the template 
CVVCVC, are shown by McCarthy and Prince to be derived from the basic form 
I verb template, CVCVC, by preﬁ xation of a mora, lengthening the initial vowel 
(McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 29, 1990b: 262). CVVCVC words are analysed as 
a trochaic foot plus a degenerate foot—a monomoraic syllable. The derivation of 
CVVCVC words will be discussed further below.
Following Ratcliﬀ e (1990), I assume that Arabic has two morphological levels. 
Level one, which aﬀ ects the stem of the word predominantly, can be said to 
correspond roughly to the non-concatenative (or inﬁ xal) morphology; and level 
two, which does not aﬀ ect the stem of the word, works predominantly by adding 
aﬃ  xes to the beginning and end of the word stem. As a working hypothesis, level-
one morphology is roughly equivalent to derivational morphology, and level-two 
morphology to inﬂ ectional morphology. However, some level-two aﬃ  xes change 
the class membership of the word from adjective to noun, or from noun to ad-
jective and therefore appear to be part of the derivational morphology. At both 
morphological levels, the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis predicts that morpho-
logical processes will apply to, and involve, authentic units of prosody (the mora, 
the syllable, the foot, or the phonological word).
In this chapter I discuss the level-one morphology of Cairene and San’ani. I 
begin by discussing the verbal morphology, establishing the basic verbal templates 
and then the derivative templates, including nominal deverbal derivatives. Under 
level-one nominal morphology I consider the formation of various broken plural 
types in the dialects.
Level-one morphological processes predominantly aﬀ ect the stem. In a few 
cases, a level-one process involves a preﬁ x or suﬃ  x in addition to a change in the 
stem template or the vocalic melody. In all cases, level-one processes occur prior 
to level-two processes. Level-one processes include the derivation of the internal 
passive (in Standard Arabic and San’ani), triliteral verb forms II to X (II to XV in 
Standard Arabic), quadriliteral verb form II, verbal derivatives including the active 
participle, the passive participle, the fa clƒn adjective in Cairene, nouns of instru-
ment and place, and verbal nouns of derived verb forms; in the nominal morph-
ology, level-one processes include the formation of broken plurals and diminutives 
and the elative. In the dialects, I assume that certain derived templates are the 
result of historical derivations which have since become lexicalized. These include 
most of the derived triliteral verbal templates, since new verbs are formed on very 
few templates. For San’ani, lexicalized derived verbal templates include triliteral 
forms III, IV, VII, VIII, and, possibly, VI and X. Triliteral forms II and V and 
the quadriliteral forms I and II are still actively derived. In Cairene, lexicalized 
derived verbal templates include triliteral forms III, IV, VI, VIII, IX, and X. Triliter-
al forms II, V, and VII and the quadriliteral forms I and II are still actively derived. 
Additional forms involving the preﬁ x sti-/sta- are at least semi-active: many of 
these forms are restricted to uneducated speech or are stigmatized, and sti- is pre-

ﬁ xed to recently-derived quadriliteral verbs, as in stiʔamrik ‘to ape the Americans’. 
In  Section 6.5 I consider the derivation of triliteral verbal forms II to X, some of 
which I assume to be historical.
6.5 LEVEL-ONE VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
The canonical pattern of the Arabic verb is far more restricted than that of the noun: 
with the exception of biliteral verbs (which I deal with below) and form IX, verbal 
stems are disyllabic in both dialects and end in a light syllable (CVC). Diﬀ erences 
between the dialects are attested insofar as certain templates are rare in one or 
other dialect and form IX, indicating colour or defect, is attested only in Cairene:4 
in San’ani, as in many other eastern dialects, the function of form IX has been 
taken over by form II. Very few modern dialects have forms above X. A few North 
African dialects use form XI for colours and defects, as exempliﬁ ed by mƒr ‘to 
become red’ attested in the dialect of the Algerian Jews (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 
69), and Cairene has forms (relatively infrequently attested5) which involve the pre-
ﬁ xation of sti- or sta- to forms II and III to give stifa ccil, stafa ccil, and stifƒ cil (Cuva-
lay-Haak 1997: 110). Form IV is rare in all modern dialects of Arabic (Fischer and 
Jastrow 1980: 70), but more common in San’ani than in Cairene. Due to the weak-
ness of the initial non-radical glottal stop in form IV ʔaf     cal, several form IV verbs 
have been adapted to a form I pattern,6 or replaced by a form II verb (Fischer and 
Jastrow 1980: 46; Cuvalay-Haak 1997: 109). Original form VII (n + I) has been 
replaced by t + I in Cairene as the productive means of forming the passive of form 
I. n + I is attested for very few roots in San’ani (Rossi 1939; Retsö 1983: 147) 
and t + I does not exist. This state of aﬀ airs is partly due to the fact that San’ani 
retains the apophonic passive for some roots whereby passives are produced by 
the vocalic melody /u-i/ or /i-i/ in the perfect and /u-a/ in the imperfect (see Sec-
tion 6.3; Watson 1993b: 91),7 and partly due to the fact that San’ani uses form VIII 
4 Badawi and Hinds (1986) include at least 13 form IX verbs which indicate neither colour or 
defect.
5 Badawi and Hinds (1986) include at least 32 sti-/sta- + II verbs and four sti-/sta- + III verbs. Sti-
/sta- + II/III forms are found in other dialects including Jerusalem, Damascene, and Muslim Tunisian 
(Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 71).
6 In the Yemeni dialect of Ibb, ʔacjab ‘to please’ has been adapted to the form I pattern to give cagab. 
Cairene has both form IV and form I patterns of this verb. Of these, form IV is more prestigious. As an 
active participle, the form I participle cƒgib is used and not mucgib. In Cairene, the historical adaptation 
of a closed set of form IV verbs to form I has led to a set of transitive verbs with the vocalic melody /a/ 
which contrast with form I intransitive verbs with the vocalic melody /i/ (see Section 1.3).
7 Internal passives in San’ani are slightly more common in the imperfect than in the perfect (Watson 
2000: 86; cf. Holes 1998 for Gulf dialects). Forms such as hƒƒ yuʔkal ‘this can be eaten’ and xa 
yugrƒ ‘readable writing’ are more common than ʔukil and gur¤. Internal passives in the perfect are 
regularly found, however, for certain roots, as in: wulid ‘he was born’, kumil ‘it m. was completed’, 
gutil ‘he was killed’, hƒƒ ʔawwal ar¤g zuﬂ iat ‘this is the ﬁ rst road to be asphalted’, wujid ‘it m. was 
found’, summiyat ‘she was called’.

134
(inﬁ x /t/) to derive passives of form I from other roots (e.g. abas ‘to imprison’, 
tabas ‘to be imprisoned’; bƒ c ‘to sell’, btƒ c ‘to be sold’). The inﬁ x /t/ is also used 
in at least one case to derive a passive verb from a denominal verb, namely maga 
‘to cut with scissors’ (cf. maga ‘scissors’), which is passivized as mtaga ‘to be 
cut with scissors’.8 While form VIII is very common in San’ani, it is relatively rare 
in Cairene.
Of the nine derived triliteral verb forms (eleven in Cairene if sti/sta + II and 
sti/sta + III are counted as separate forms), form II is the most frequently attested 
in both dialects. It is the most productive form today (most loan verbs are con-
structed on this pattern), and is much more frequent in modern Arabic dialects in 
general than it is in either Classical or Modern Standard Arabic (Cuvalay-Haak 
1997: 109). In the table of triliteral verb forms in (26), the traditional symbols /f-c-l/ 
denote the three root consonants.

Unlike canonical nouns, the verb forms V–X in Cairene (VII–X in San’ani, with 
a few V and VI instances) have initial consonant clusters which are syllabiﬁ ed 
by prosthesis. For Standard Arabic, McCarthy and Prince analyse the initial con-
sonant of the cluster as linked to an incomplete syllable (McCarthy and Prince 
1990a: 39), which mirrors their analysis of the stem-ﬁ nal extrametrical consonant 
linked to a ﬁ nal incomplete syllable.10 While ﬁ nal C functions as the onset to an 
incomplete syllable, initial C is moraic—see (27).
 8 In other dialects of Yemeni Arabic, including Ibbi, form VIII is the most productive means of 
deriving the passive from a form I active verb, as in: ktatab ‘to be written’ (katab ‘to write’), staraq ‘to 
be stolen’ (saraq ‘to steal’), štarab ‘to be drunk (drink)’ (širib ‘to drink’), xtabaz ‘to be baked’ (xabaz 
‘to bake’).
 9 fucul is rare in Cairene today. It appears to have been considerably more common in nineteenth-
century CE Cairene (Woidich 1995: 279).
10 An incomplete syllable is not the same as an extraprosodic syllable. I assume that domain-ﬁ nal 
consonants in CVC syllables are extrametrical and associate directly with the syllable node of the pre-
ceding syllable at the end of the derivation.

6.5 level-one verbal morphology
135
Evidence for the moraicity of this initial C is seen in the syllabiﬁ cation of the C to 
the right of a prosthetic vowel in dialects which do not allow consonant clusters in 
syllable-onset position. Consider the examples from Cairene in (28).

Epenthesis typically occurs in both dialects after an extrametrical consonant (cf. 
Section 4.4.1.1)—and therefore would be expected to occur after and not before 
the initial C in these derived verb forms if the initial C were extrametrical. Loan 
words with initial consonant clusters in the source language, for example, are typic-
ally syllabiﬁ ed in both dialects by epenthesis to the right of the extrametrical con-
sonant, as in the examples in (29) of English loan words in Cairene and San’ani.

Initial epenthesis in verb forms V–X is explained by the fact that initial C in these 
forms is linked to an underlying extrasyllabic mora (McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 
12), whereas the unsyllabiﬁ ed C in words such as b’lastik (= bilastik) ‘plastic’ is 
not linked to an underlying mora (McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 13). The moraic 
diﬀ erence between these two initial consonant types is accounted for by the Pro-
sodic Morphology Hypothesis, which states that templates are deﬁ ned in terms of 
authentic units of prosody: mora (µ), syllable (ª), foot (F), etc. In Cairene b(i)lastik, 
the initial consonant b is part of the basic word and is therefore not associated with 
a mora—epenthesis to the right of b is required to enable b to be correctly syllabi-
ﬁ ed. In forms V–X in Cairene and VII–X in San’ani, templates are derived by the 
preﬁ xation of the minimal prosodic unit, the mora (27). A mora to the left of a non-
moraic consonant cannot associate with the syllable to its right and is thus associ-
ated with an initial extrametrical syllable. Verb forms II–IV are derived by mora 
reduplication, and the majority of San’ani form V and VI verbs (see Section 6.5.4) 
are derived from form II and III cognates by preﬁ xation of a syllable (ti- or ta-).
The triliteral verb templates in the dialects are bimoraic (form I), trimoraic 
(forms II, III, IV, VII, VIII, and IX) or quadrimoraic (forms V, VI, X)—see (30).
The templates for verbal forms II to X can be viewed as direct or indirect deri-
vations from the basic form I template. The infrequent quintimoraic verb forms 
 stafaccal ~ stifaccal ~ stifaccil and stifƒcil attested in Cairene are derived secondarily

by preﬁ xing sta- or sti- to a trimoraic (form II or form III) stem. The Cairene form 
stafa ccal ~ stifa ccal ~ stifa ccil often has the same or a similar meaning to form V of 
the same root, as in: stiʔatta ‘to result’ (= tʔatta), stiʔaggar ‘to employ, hire’ (= 
tʔaggar), stiaggig ‘to oﬀ er pretexts, make false excuses’ (= taggig), stiattim ‘to 
become inevitable, insist’ (= tattim), staaar ‘to prepare oneself’ (cf. taar 
= passive of aar ‘to prepare, get ready’) and stibarra ‘to have enough of’ (= 
intensive of tbarra). In a few cases, stafa ccal and stifa ccil have the same meaning as 
form X or form VIII of the same root, as in: staragga ‘to hope for’ (= starga) and 
stiraxxa ‘to become loose, slacken’ (= rtaxa).
The derived forms can be divided into two semantic types—those which extend, 
and those which reduce the valence of the underlying verb. In what follows, I con-
sider ﬁ rst an analysis of ﬁ nite verb stems and then examine the derivation of verb 
forms. Within the discussion of derived verb forms, I look initially at those which

extend the valence of the underlying verb, and then at forms which reduce the 
valence of it.
6.5.1 Finite verb stems
To account for the fact that, in contrast to noun stems, ﬁ nite verb stems are disyl-
labic in all forms and always end in CVC in Standard Arabic, McCarthy and Prince 
(1990a: 35) propose that ﬁ nite verb stems end in a light syllable templatic suﬃ  x:
According to this analysis, form I (CVCVC) comprises a base CV plus the ﬁ nite 
verb suﬃ  x, form II (CVCCVC) a base CVC plus the ﬁ nite verb suﬃ  x, form III 
(CVVCVC) a base CVV plus the ﬁ nite verb suﬃ  x, and so on. However, while a 
suﬃ  x may mark a non-ﬁ nite form, it is counterintuitive that a special morpheme 
should mark ﬁ niteness within the stem. My analysis of verb stems diﬀ ers from 
that of McCarthy and Prince. I claim that verbs have light ﬁ nal syllables because, 
unlike nouns which can stand on their own, verbs are incomplete until properly 
inﬂ ected. When properly inﬂ ected, the ﬁ nal syllable becomes heavy in the case 
of consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes and remains light in the case of vowel-initial 
subject suﬃ  xes. This is illustrated in the paradigm of katab ‘to write’ in Cairene, 
as shown in (32).

‘you m.s. wrote’ 
katabtu 
‘you pl. wrote’
 
katabti ‘you f.s. wrote’
 
katabt 
‘I wrote’ 
katabna ‘we wrote’
In the case of ﬁ nal-weak verbs with the stem CVCV, the stem-ﬁ nal vowel in Cai-
rene is realized as long before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes to give a bimoraic 
pre-suﬃ  x syllable.11 This is illustrated in (33) in the paradigm of nisi ‘to forget’.

VIII CtVCV(C), form IX CCVC(C)) or of a trochee plus a degenerate foot (form II 
CVCCV(C), form III CVVCV(C)). However, since non-inﬂ ected ﬁ nite verbs are 
unattested, and since inﬂ ection is achieved through suﬃ  xation in the case of all but 
the {third person masculine singular} inﬂ ectional form, I analyse the verb stem as 
an incomplete form. The light ﬁ nal syllable is necessary in order to accommodate 
consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes. Final C of the stem is moraic in pre-consonantal 
position, but non-moraic in phonological-word-ﬁ nal or in vowel-initial position. 
In fully inﬂ ected forms, verb stems comprise complete prosodic feet when the 
inﬂ ectional suﬃ  x is consonant-initial—a single iambic foot (forms I, VII, VIII) or 
two trochaic feet (forms II, III, V, VI, IX, X). It is only when the inﬂ ectional suﬃ  x 
is null or vowel-initial, and only in the case of the derived forms II, III, IV, V, VI, 
and X, that the stem has the anti-iambic pattern (µµ)(µ), analysed here as a trochee 
plus a degenerate foot (see Section 6.4.2). Consider the representation of a form-I 
stem (34a) and a form-II stem (34b) in pre-consonantal position.
6.5.2 Forms II, III, and IV
Forms II, III, and IV have an initial bimoraic syllable formed by mora preﬁ xation. 
Mora preﬁ xation is analysed here as reduplication of the minimal prosodic unit, 
the mora. Forms II, III, and IV share the fact that they extend the valence of the 
underlying verb: form II is almost always transitive, and is often the intensive or 
causative of form I; form III is usually transitive and often implies participation or 
eﬀ ort; in some cases, it has a similar meaning to a form II cognate, as in San’ani 
zawwa ‘to act hastily’ and zƒwa ‘to be in a hurry, rush (someone)’, jawwab and 
jƒwab ‘to reply’, cawwan and cƒwan ‘to help’, sallƒ and sƒlƒ ‘to console’, and 
najja and nƒja ‘to let (someone) succeed’; in Proto-Afroasiatic, qƒtala was an 
intensive and a variant of qattala (Zaborski 1994, 1997, 1999: 49). The relatively 
rare form IV, more common in San’ani than in Cairene, is always transitive and 
often has an additional causative sense. The reduplicated mora is associated with 
the medial root consonant (C) (form II), with the leftmost vowel (V) (form III), or 
with the vowel of a causative preﬁ x (form IV),12 as in (35).

6.5.3). The medial vowel of the intermediate form *safacal was subject to syncope, and the initial con-
sonant of the preﬁ x weakened in (almost all) dialects of Arabic to ʔ and, in some, eventually to 0.

The mora reduplication which results in lengthening of the leftmost vowel charac-
teristic of form III is also used to derive the active participle of form I verbs, as in 
kƒtib ‘writer’, kƒﬁ r ‘inﬁ del, unbeliever’, ʔƒtil ‘killer’ (CA), gƒtil ‘killer’ (SA).
The mora reduplication which results in medial gemination in the derivation of 
form II verbs is also used partially to derive the noun of profession or habitude 
CaGGaaC (for example, xabbƒz ‘baker’, CA gazzƒr ‘butcher’, baʔʔƒl ‘grocer’), 
and certain nouns of instrument CaGGaaC and CaGGaaCa/ih (e.g. kabbƒs ‘plung-
er, piston’, CA saddƒda ‘plug, stopper’, sallƒka ‘any instrument used for cleaning 
or unblocking pipes’, sammƒca ‘loud-speaker’). The plurals of many lexicalized 
active participles are derived by substitution of medial gemination for vowel 
length, usually accompanied by lengthening of the vowel of the second syllable, as 
in Cairene hƒmil pl. hummal ‘careless person’, rƒgil pl. riggƒla ‘man’, bƒyi  c pl. 
bayyƒca ‘seller, salesman’, kƒﬁ r pl. kuffƒr ‘inﬁ del, unbeliever’ (cf. McCarthy and 
Prince 1990a: 46).
Medial gemination carries with it a sense of intensiﬁ cation in Arabic. Form II 
verbs often involve action on a plural object, or, in fewer cases, action by a plural 
subject (Greenberg 1991), as in Syrian ʔaaf ‘to pick ﬂ ower(s)’ versus ʔaaf ‘to 
pick many ﬂ owers’ (Cowell 1964: 253, cited in Greenberg 1991: 580) and Iraqi 
nigab ‘to bore a hole’ versus naggab ‘to bore many holes’ (Erwin 1963: 65–6, 
cited in Greenberg 1991: 581). In San’ani, form II verbs may imply continuous 
action or action done on several occasions, where the corresponding form I verb 
implies a single action, as in katab ‘to write (once)’ versus kattab ‘to write con-
tinually, keep writing, write all over’. Nominal patterns with gemination of the 
second consonant express an intensive meaning, as in Standard Arabic kurrƒm(un) 
‘very noble’, qudd¶s(un) ‘most holy’, and širr¤r(un) ‘very bad’ (Fischer 1997: 193). 
Where the patterns fƒcil (of the active participle) and faccƒl exist for a single root, 
the faccƒl pattern usually indicates intensiﬁ cation of the fƒcil pattern. This may 
mean that the agent performs a one-oﬀ  action in the fƒcil pattern, but undertakes an 
action repetitively or habitually in the faccƒl pattern. Cairene ʔƒtil ‘killer’ contrasts 
with ʔattƒl ‘a hardened murderer’ and ʔƒi ‘one who cuts’ with ʔaƒ ‘clipper, 
one who shears animals’.

guished by an initial incomplete syllable, represented on the prosodic template as 
a mora linked to an extrametrical syllable, as in (27).
Form VII, common in Cairene but relatively rare in San’ani, usually indicates 
passive or middle voice, as in San’ani šaal ‘to work’, nšaal ‘to be occupied’; 
ga	ƒ ‘to pay a debt’, nga	ƒ ‘to be ﬁ nished’, and Cairene kasar ‘to break’, tkasar 
‘to be broken’; xadac ‘to trick’, nxadac ‘to be tricked’. Form VIII13 usually indicates 
reﬂ exivity, passivity or reciprocity, as in San’ani xalƒ ‘to be through with’, xtalƒ 
‘to be killed’; abas ‘to imprison’, tabas ‘to be imprisoned’, and Cairene gamac 
‘to join’, gtamac ‘to meet’. Form IX in Cairene usually indicates the subject bearing 
or coming to bear a certain colour or, far less commonly, a defect, as in marr ‘to 
become red’, cragg ‘to become lame’. However, a substantial number of Cairene 
form IX verbs indicate the state of being, or the process of coming to bear, some 
characteristic other than colour or defect,14 as in gramm ‘to become large in stat-
ure’, daʔʔ ‘to become salty (food)’, laww ~ layy ‘to become sweet’, ma ‘to 
go bad’, xšann ‘to become rough’, dla cc ‘to become bland, insipid’.
Form VII is derived from form I by the preﬁ xation of an initial mora which is 
ﬁ lled by /n/ in San’ani, and by /t/ in present-day Cairene. Form VIII is derived from 
form I by association of /t/ with an initial mora followed by metathesis of /t/ with 
the initial root consonant. Form VIII metathesis is expressed informally in (36):15
(36) 
tCVCVC → CtVCVC
Form IX is derived by preﬁ xation of a mora which is ﬁ lled by the initial root con-
sonant (cf. form IV above, Section 6.5.2); the ﬁ nal root consonant is geminated to 
accommodate the rightmost mora of the original bimoraic template.
Form X (staf     cal) was originally the reﬂ exive or passive of form IV (ʔaf     cal) 
(McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 38), which in a number of ancient Semitic lan-
guages16 had the form *saf     cal or *šaf     cal (Zaborski 1999: 44). In Arabic dialects

were common at this stage, but have since been replaced by t + I. Badawi and Hinds list a number of 
form VIII/t + I doublets. We may surmise that n + I verb forms were gradually lost along with VIII 
ftacal forms and that t + I verb forms became more predominant to replace both. This may be taken as 
tentative evidence that some aspects of level-one non-concatenative morphology are in the process of 
being replaced by concatenative morphology.
14 Eisenstein (1990) mentions a total of 103 form IX verbs in Standard Arabic of which around 
half describe the state or process of bearing a colour, and only seven describe physical defects. The 
remainder describe activities, states, and processes which relate to neither colours nor defects.
15 This is described by McCarthy (1979a, 1981) as the Eighth Binyan Flop.

Form X is no longer derived actively from form IV. Where form X is derived, it 
appears to be derived from a form I stem to give the estimative of the basic verb. 
Therefore, form X has been reanalysed as sta- + CCVC. As seen above (see Sec-
tion 6.5.1), in Cairene sta-/sti- is now also preﬁ xed to a form II or III or quadri-
literal base to derive additional verb forms.
6.5.4 Forms V and VI
Forms V and VI are derived indirectly from form I. The semantic roles played by 
form V include the medio-passive or reﬂ exive of form II. The main semantic role 
played by form VI is reciprocity where form III indicates participation. In Cairene, 
forms V and VI are derived from forms II and III by preﬁ xation of a mora which 
is ﬁ lled by /t/, as in sammim ‘to poison (someone)’, tsammim ‘to be poisoned’; 
callim ‘to teach (someone)’, t   callim ‘to be taught, learn’; and sƒbiʔ ‘he competed 
with (someone)’, tsabʔu ‘they m. competed with each other’; cƒtib ‘he reproached 
(someone)’, t   catbu ‘they reproached each other’.17
In Standard Arabic, forms V and VI are derived from forms II and III by preﬁ x-
ation of ta-, as in takallama ‘he talked’ versus kallama ‘he spoke (to someone)’. In 
San’ani, the majority of form V and VI verbs are realized with initial ti- (ta- before 
a root-initial guttural) in the perfect, but with t- in the imperfect and the imperative, 
as in taƒkƒ ‘he talked’, yitƒkƒ ‘he talks’, itƒkƒ ‘talk m.s.!’; tila

am ‘he put on 
a face veil’, yitla

am ‘he puts on a face veil’, itla

am ‘put on a face veil m.s.!’. 
Verbs with a root-initial sibilant are realized with t- in both aspects with no vowel 
prosthesis in the perfect (cf. Section 4.3), as in tsaccal ‘he coughed’, yitsaccal ‘he 
coughs’. In a few recently introduced or derived verbs, however, the preﬁ x in the 
perfect is realized as [it] after a consonant or in utterance-initial position, as it is 
in Cairene. These include itzawwaj ‘he got married’ (cf. ta carras ‘he got married’) 
and itma cjan ‘it m. was puttied’ (< macj¶n ‘putty’).18
For forms VII, VIII, IX, and X in Standard Arabic, McCarthy and Prince 
(1990a: 39) analyse the initial incomplete syllable, (ª), as a separate morpheme, 
which they describe as a detransitivizing preﬁ x. The detransitivizing preﬁ x is rep-
resented in (38).
(38) Detransitivizing preﬁ x
 
(ª)
17 The second semantic sense of form VI in Standard Arabic, that of pretending or acting that which 
is implied in the basic verb, adjective or root, has been largely taken over in San’ani by quadriliteral 
verbs with inserted /y/ as Cii (see Section 6.5.6).
18 It may be that the t- form here developed through syncope deleting the preﬁ x vowel in the imper-
fect and the resulting vowelless preﬁ x then being generalized to the perfect. In Cairene, it is probable 
that the form V and VI t- preﬁ x developed through generalization of the moraic t- detransitivizing preﬁ x.

morphology
142
For Cairene and for a few relevant verbs in San’ani the detransitivizing preﬁ x, (ª), 
functions as a morpheme for forms V and VI in addition to VII, VIII, IX, and X. 
For the majority of San’ani form V and VI verbs, the detransitivizing preﬁ x is an 
initial complete syllable, ª, as it is in Standard Arabic.
6.5.5 Form I imperfect template
The imperfect aspect is formed by adding a person preﬁ x and a number/gender suf-
ﬁ x to the verb stem (see Section 6.4.2), as in Cairene:
(39) yi + garrib + u ‘they try’
of verbal preﬁ xes and suﬃ  xes for the dialects are presented in Chapter 7 (Table 4). 
In form I, the template of the imperfect triliteral and ﬁ nal-weak verb diﬀ ers from 
that of the perfect. While the perfect has the template CVCV(C), the imperfect has 
the template CCV(C), as in: katab ‘he wrote’ versus (yi)ktub ‘he writes’ (SA) and 
nisi ‘he forgot’ versus (yi)nsa ‘he forgets’ (CA). Historically, the template for the 
imperfect aspect of form I was derived from that of the perfect through syncope 
of the unstressed medial vowel (Versteegh 1997: 85 for Standard Arabic). Today, 
however, there is no evidence for the synchronic derivation of the form I imperfect 
template from that of the perfect; I therefore assume that, in contrast to the derived 
verbal forms, the stem of form I triliteral and ﬁ nal-weak verbs has two distinct 
templatic patterns: CVCV(C) in the perfect and CCV(C) in the imperfect.
6.5.6 Non-triliteral verbs
Most verbs and their related nouns have three root consonants. A signiﬁ cant 
number, however, have either two or four root consonants. Quadriliteral verbs in 
the perfect invariably take the template CVCCVC in both dialects, thus sharing a 
trimoraic template with the form II triliteral, as in San’ani gambar ‘to sit’, laﬂ af 
‘to collect’, galwaz ‘to screw’ and Cairene cabcab ‘to cram’, catras ‘to resist, balk’, 
and carʔal ‘to hinder’. Some quadriliteral verbs are derived from a nominal or ad-
jectival source or a foreign loan, as in San’ani saynam ‘to go to the cinema’, ancan 
‘to make (someone) San’ani’, timajnan ‘to become mad’ (from majn¶n ‘mad’) and 
Cairene sawdin ‘to Sudanize’. Many other quadriliteral verbs involve reduplica-
tion of a biliteral root (as in laﬂ af ‘to collect’ and cabcab ‘to cram’), reduplication 
of Ciii (as in San’ani bahrar ‘to stare’ and balal ‘to bruise’, and Cairene dahnin ‘to 
make greasy’ and šaclil ‘to kindle, cause to ﬂ are up’), or insertion of an augment-
ing consonant as Cii or Ciii. The principal augmenting consonants in the formation 
of quadriliteral verbs in San’ani are /w/, /y/, and /l/, and to a lesser extent /n/ or /r/. 
In general, /l/, /y/, /r/, and /n/ are inserted as Cii, while the labio-velar glide may be 
inserted as either Ciii or, less commonly, Cii. Quadriliteral verbs derived by means 
of an augmenting consonant usually relate semantically to a biliteral or triliteral 
verb, noun, or adjective which lacks the augmenting consonant, as in San’ani alfƒ 
In (39), yi- indicates {third person} person and -u indicates {plural}. The full set 

6.5 level-one verbal morphology

‘to rinse’, affƒ ‘to clean’; dalhaf ‘to keep pushing’, dahaf ‘to push’; ambal ‘to 
drum’, abbal ‘to drum’; šangac ‘to climb’, šagac ‘to cross a stream’; ʔaynag ‘to 
make someone elegant’, ʔan¤g ‘elegant’; fartaš ‘to spy’, fattaš ‘to inspect’; harwas 
‘to shove something into a small hole’, haras ‘to bury something’; aswal ‘to wash 
up’, asal ‘to wash’. Quadriliterals which relate to a biliteral or triliteral verb or 
noun often have a more speciﬁ c meaning than the basic biliteral or triliteral, as in 
San’ani alfƒ ‘to rinse’ versus affƒ ‘to clean’; aswal ‘to wash up’ versus asal 
‘to wash’; and tigašwa ‘to shiver convulsively’ versus gaša ‘to shiver’; and as in 
Cairene dahnin ‘to make greasy’ versus dahan ‘to coat with oil, paint, etc.’.
Quadriliterals derived through reduplication of a biliteral root tend to have 
a combined diminutive and/or iterative sense where the biliteral implies single 
action, as exemplifed by San’ani šamm ‘to smell’, šamšam ‘to sniﬀ ’; dagg ‘to 
knock’, dagdag ‘to knock several times (with little knocks)’; cass ‘to touch’, cascas 
‘to touch several times, stroke’, and Cairene rašš ‘to sprinkle’, rašraš ‘to sprinkle 
all over or repeatedly’; dabb ‘to bang, thump, hit’, dabdib ‘to make a repeated 
banging, thudding (with feet)’. San’ani quadriliterals with an inﬁ x /l/ as Cii or /w/ 
as Ciii usually imply greater intensity and continuity of action than the related trilit-
eral. Thus, dalkam ‘to hit violently, keep hitting’ contrasts with dakam ‘to hit’, 
dalhaf ‘to keep pushing’ contrasts with dahaf ‘to push’, kaltab ‘to keep writing’ 
contrasts with katab ‘to write’, tigašwa ‘to shiver convulsively’ contrasts with 
gaša ‘to shiver’ and tinagwal ‘to move from place to place’ with nagal ‘to move’.
Quadriliteral verbs usually have at most one derived form through preﬁ xation 
of t- (ti- or ta- in San’ani, cf. Section 6.5.4). For a few quadriliteral verbs, how-
ever, Cairene derives a further form by preﬁ xation of sti-/sta-. This often has the 
same meaning as the basic form I, as in stiargim ‘to hover around’ (= argim), or 
the derived form II, as in stiraxrax ‘to become loose or ﬂ abby’ (= traxrax). While 
the form I quadriliteral shares a template with the form II triliteral, the form II 
quadriliteral shares a template with the form V triliteral, tCVCCVC in Cairene, 
tVCVCCVC in San’ani. As for the relationship between triliteral forms II and V, 
quadriliteral form II often gives the reﬂ exive or medio-passive of the form I verb, 
as in San’ani gaga ‘to cut up’, tigaga ‘to be cut up’; ʔaynag ‘to make some-
one elegant’, taʔaynag ‘to make oneself elegant’; and Cairene carʔal ‘to hinder’, 
tcarʔal ‘to be hindered’; and dahwis ‘to trample on’, tdahwis ‘to be trampled on’. 
Several form II quadriliterals with /y/ in San’ani, however, impose a ‘pretend to’ 
or ‘act as’ sense on the basic triliteral verb or adjective, one of the alternative 
 senses of the triliteral form VI template in Standard Arabic. Examples include 
timaywat ‘to pretend to be dead’ (cf. Standard tamƒwat), timayra	 ‘to feign ill-
ness’ (cf. Standard tamƒra	), tibaylah ‘to act stupidly’ (cf. Standard tabƒlah), 
taxayba ‘to pretend innocence cunningly’, taayag ‘to act miserly’ and tacayzaz 
‘to pretend to refuse’.
Biliteral verbs are in many ways more interesting morphologically than quad-
riliteral verbs, because they involve a number of diﬀ erent templates which are 
unique to them. The dialects have four types of biliteral verbs: deﬁ cient verbs such 
as kal and xad in Cairene, which are derived historically from glottal-stop-initial

stems and which now lack an initial consonant in the perfect; ﬁ nal-weak verbs 
such as nisi and rama in Cairene, nis¤ and ramƒ in San’ani, which lack a ﬁ nal con-
sonant; doubled verbs such as dabb ‘to bang, thump, hit’ in Cairene, in which the 
second consonant of the stem is geminate; and hollow verbs such as Cairene ʔƒl 
(gƒl in San’ani) and šƒl which lack a medial consonant. In this section I consider 
the analysis of ﬁ nal-weak verbs, doubled verbs, and hollow verbs.
6.5.6.1 Final-weak verbs
Arabic dialects have a set of verbs which share a vowel-ﬁ nal stem. These verbs 
are traditionally known as third-weak or ﬁ nal-weak verbs. The stem-ﬁ nal vowel is 
short in Cairene and long in San’ani. In Cairene, the quality of the ﬁ nal vowel is 
identical to that of the initial vowel of the stem, as in: nisi ‘he forgot’ and rama ‘he 
threw’. In San’ani, the leftmost stem vowel of verbs ending in -¤ is most commonly 
/i/, but /u/ where one of the root consonants is a pharyngealized coronal (cf. Sec-
tion 10.5): nis¤ ‘to forget’ and dir¤ ‘to know’ contrast with ru	¤ ‘to want’ and xu¤ 
‘to walk’. Consider the paradigms of CiCi-type (40a) and CaCa-type (40b) ﬁ nal-
weak verbs in San’ani and Cairene.

When the vocalic melody of a ﬁ nal-weak verb is /i/ in Cairene (40a), the stem 
takes a long vowel /¤/ before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes. In San’ani, the 
unsuﬃ  xed stem ends in a long vowel; therefore, the stem of CiCi verbs remains 

6.5 level-one verbal morphology
145
unchanged before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes. In verbs with the vocalic mel-
ody /a/—as in (40b)—the stem in Cairene takes a long mid vowel /¢/ before conso-
nant-initial subject suﬃ  xes, and in San’ani a diphthong /ay/.
Historically, the long vowel/diphthong of the stem goes back to a time when 
ﬁ nal-weak verbs were analysable as two sound consonants and a glide (either *w 
or *y). The underlying glide was not realized word-ﬁ nally due to a constraint on 
stem-ﬁ nal diphthongs in this position. In word-ﬁ nal position, the diphthong was 
replaced by a long vowel—either /ƒ/ or /¤/ depending on the vocalic melody of 
the verb. In a number of dialects of Arabic, including Cairene, the long vowel was 
shortened historically due to a further constraint on word-ﬁ nal long vowels (see 
Section 4.2). The glide element of the root manifested itself in a long vowel or 
in a diphthong to the left of consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes. Thus, Standard Ara-
bic nasiytu (= nas¤tu) ‘I forgot’ is analysed as association of the root /n-s-y/ with 
the template CaCiC (+ tu) and ramaytu ‘I threw’ as association of the root /r-m-y/ 
with the template CaCaC (+ tu). In Cairene, the pre-consonantal diphthong *ay- in 
CaCa stems was subject to coalescence historically, and today has a monophthon-
gal realization /¢/. In San’ani, the original diphthong /ay/ has remained.
Today ﬁ nal-weak verbs are analysed as vowel-ﬁ nal and not as glide-ﬁ nal in both 
dialects: ﬁ nal-weak verbs have the stem CVCV in Cairene and CVCVV in San’ani. 
Before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes, the stem has an allomorph ending in a 
long vowel in Cairene (/¤/ in CiCi stems, /¢/ in CaCa stems). In San’ani, a long 
vowel /¤/ is realized before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes in CiCii stems and a 
diphthong /ay/ in CaCaa stems.
There are three main reasons for considering ﬁ nal-weak verbs to be only histor-
ically linked to ﬁ nal-glide roots. Firstly, although verbs are derived historically 
from both w-ﬁ nal and y-ﬁ nal roots, the glide of w-ﬁ nal roots does not manifest 
itself in inﬂ ectional forms: the verb dacƒ–yad  c¶ ‘to invoke God’ in San’ani, for 
example, is related to the noun dacwih. Before a consonant-initial subject suﬃ  x, 
the perfect stem is realized as dacay-, and not as dacaw- as it is in Standard Arab-
ic. Irrespective of the historical root, the diphthong /ay/ in San’ani and long mid-
vowel /¢/ in Cairene is realized pre-consonantally, and has replaced the original 
*aw- of *w-ﬁ nal verbs. Secondly, the /¢/ variant has at least made a partial attempt 
to squeeze out the /¤/ variant in Cairene—/¢/ is obligatory before consonant-initial 
subject suﬃ  xes in CaCa verbs, but is also a less common variant in CiCi verbs: ‘I 
forgot’ can be realized as either nis¤t or nis¢t (Abdel-Massih 1975: 137; Broselow 
1976: 148). On analogy with ﬁ nal-weak verbs, the diphthong/long mid-vowel is 
now used as an allomorphic adjunct before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes in 
doubled verbs (see Section 7.1.1). Thirdly, there is evidence that coalescence of 
diphthongs which resulted in the pre-consonantal form /¢/ is no longer a synchron-
ic process in Cairene (see Section 2.4.3).
6.5.6.2 Doubled verbs
The stems of doubled verbs end in a ﬁ nal geminate consonant. Consider the fol-
lowing paradigms of the form I doubled verb abb ‘to love, like’ in San’ani and

Historically, doubled verbs were mapped to the same disyllabic bimoraic template 
as triliteral verbs. However, they diﬀ ered from triliteral verbs in that the second syl-
lable of the template was realized only when the verb took a consonant-initial sub-
ject suﬃ  x, as in ababnƒ ‘we loved’. Before vowel-initial subject suﬃ  xes, some 
type of Double Rule took place to produce a geminate ﬁ nal consonant in a mono-
syllabic base (Moore 1990: 81). The Standard Arabic Double Rule is illustrated in 
(20) in the derivation of sadda ‘he closed up’ from *sadada.
According to the Double Rule, resyllabiﬁ cation of the coda mora results in desyl-
labiﬁ cation from the onset just in case the coda mora and the onset are linked to 
the same consonant melody. In dialects of Arabic today, doubled verbs only ever 
exhibit a monosyllabic base, irrespective of whether the subject suﬃ  x is consonant- 
or vowel-initial.
Broselow (1976) argues that doubled verbs in Cairene share the same underly-
ing verbal template as the triliteral verb, while demonstrating that it is no longer 
applicable to vowel-ﬁ nal biliteral verbs (such as nisi and rama), to initial-weak

19 Although forms I and IV of this root are attested, form IV is more common in Modern Standard 
Arabic. It is possible that form I was more common in Classical Arabic, and that it is avoided in Modern 
Standard Arabic due to its association with non-Standard dialect forms. In unvocalized texts, which 
constitute the vast majority of written texts in Standard Arabic, form IV is indistinguishable from form 
I in the imperfect.

verbs (such as kal and xad) or to hollow verbs. Part of her argument for this analy-
sis is that doubled roots in Cairene21 map onto active and passive participle tem-
plates in the same way as triliteral roots:22
The association of the second consonant of a doubled root with two adjacent tem-
platic positions, however, is insuﬃ  cient to claim that the doubled verb shares the 
same underlying template as the sound triliteral verb: spreading of the second con-
sonant to two adjacent consonantal slots is predicted by the requirement that all 
templatic positions are matched with a melody (see Section 4.1). In the derivation 
of active and passive participles, the second root consonant maps onto the syllable 
node of the rightmost syllable, and then spreads to the node of the ﬁ nal incomplete 
syllable:
It appears that the Double Rule became ﬁ rst morphologized and then lexicalized 
in Arabic dialects such that a distinct prosodic template now exists for the  doubled 
verb. The evidence for this is threefold: ﬁ rstly, there is no inﬂ ectional form of 
any doubled verb with a disyllabic stem in the dialects; secondly, while there are 
three vocalic melodies for triliteral verbs in the perfect aspect in both Cairene and 
San’ani (CaCaC, CiCiC, and CuCuC), the doubled verbs have a single vocalic 
melody (CaCC) (Broselow 1976: 160 for Cairene); and thirdly, in Cairene t/n + 
doubled form I verbs and doubled VIII verbs, the base is invariant in the perfect

22 In Standard Arabic, the Double Rule applies for active participles as well as for ﬁ nite verbs. The 
active participle of doubled roots therefore has a medial CVVC syllable, as in: mƒdd(un) ‘stretching’, 
mƒrr(un) ‘passing; passer-by’, fƒrr(un) ‘fugitive’ (cf. Section 5.4.1.3, Watson 1999d). The two dialects 
have a few stative adjectives of this pattern which contrast with active participles used in a verbal or 
adjectival sense: San’ani jƒff (Cairene gƒff ) ‘dry’ contrasts with jƒﬁ f (Cairene gƒﬁ f) ‘drying’.
23 To account for the fact that domain-ﬁ nal CVVC syllables have a diﬀ erent prosodic status from 
domain-ﬁ nal CVCC and CVC syllables, the rightmost C of CVVC is placed between angled brackets 
and attached to an incomplete syllable node.

San’ani provides further evidence that doubled verbs now have a distinct verbal 
template: it has a few verbs with identical second and third consonants which map 
onto a disyllabic bimoraic template in the perfect, and which take the triliteral 
-CCVC stem in the imperfect. These include jiﬁ f–yijfaf ‘to dry intr.’, jinin–yijnan 
‘to go mad’, and umum–yimum ‘to become deaf’. I therefore assume that the 
phonological process which initially produced allomorphic variation in the stem of 
Arabic doubled verbs is no longer active, either as a phonological or as a morpho-
logical process, and that doubled verbs constitute a frozen form mapping onto a 
24 In the less common forms IV and X, the imperfect and active participle template usually takes a 
diﬀ erent vocalic melody from the perfect, as in: form IV ‘to fail to meet an obligation’ ʔaxall (perf.), 
yixill (imperf.), mixill; form X ‘to subjugate’ stazall (perf.), yistizill (imperf.), mistizill (participle); how-

bimoraic, monosyllabic template. The leftmost consonant maps onto the onset of 
the syllable, the rightmost consonant onto the second mora of the template, and 
the vowel to the leftmost mora, as in (47).
6.5.6.3 Hollow verbs
Hollow verbs are traditionally analysed as verbs with a medial glide. In the perfect 
aspect, the quality of the glide is not realized in the {third person masculine sin-
gular} inﬂ ectional form or before vowel-initial subject suﬃ  xes. The glide is real-
ized in certain derived verbal and nominal forms and shows itself in the quality of 
the stem vowel in the imperfect aspect of form I verbs. The verbs šƒf ‘to see’ in 
Cairene and gƒl ‘to say’ in San’ani are hollow verbs with an original medial root 
consonant *w. The labio-velar quality of the original medial consonant surfaces in 
the /¶/ vowel of the imperfect aspect and in the short /u/ vowel of the perfect aspect 
when the verb takes a consonant-initial subject suﬃ  x. Consider the paradigm of 
Cairene šƒf in the perfect and imperfect aspects.

San’ani zƒd ‘to do more, again’ has an original medial root consonant *y. The pala-
tal quality of the medial consonant surfaces in the /¤/ vowel of the imperfect aspect 
and in the short /i/ vowel of the perfect aspect when it takes a consonant-initial 
subject suﬃ  x.

In participles of derived hollow verb forms IV and X, the medial glide is not real-

the passive participle. Consider again examples from Cairene:

Hollow verbs are traditionally said to arise from a restriction on simplex intervocal-
ic glides in verbs. While there are a few nouns of the shape CawaC(un) in Standard 
Arabic, as in xawal(un) ‘passive homosexual’ and awar(un) ‘ox; white leather; 
poplar’, there are no Caw/yaCa verbs and a very few Caw/yiCa verbs which are 
themselves rare in occurrence—these include awira ‘to have its white and black 
strongly delineated (eye)’, awisa ‘to be brave, daring’, and awia ‘to have an 
eye contracted in its outer angle’ (examples from Hava 1915). In modern dialects 
of Arabic, there is evidence that the hollow verbs have become lexicalized and 
are no longer morphologically productive. Thus I argue that hollow verbs have a 
monosyllabic, bimoraic template which is realized as CaaC before null- or vowel-
initial subject suﬃ  xes and as CVC before consonant-initial suﬃ  xes. The quality of 
the stem vowel in the latter case is determined lexically.
Evidence for the lexicalization of hollow verbs is threefold. First, as Broselow 
(1976) points out for Cairene, many deverbal nouns and adjectives of hollow roots 
take a medial /y/, irrespective of whether the original weak consonant of the root is 
/y/ or /w/. In both Cairene and San’ani, form I hollow verb active participles take 
the pattern CƒyiC irrespective of the original root of the word. Cairene šƒf ‘to see’ 
and San’ani gƒm ‘to get up’, which share an original medial radical *w, have the 
active participles šƒyif ‘seeing’ and gƒyim ‘getting up’. Similarly, hollow form VII 
and VIII verbal nouns are formed on the pattern iCCiyƒC, irrespective of the qual-
ity of the original medial glide. Examples attested in both dialects include insiyƒb 
verbal noun of insƒb ‘to pour, ﬂ ow’ (root /s-y-b/), ixtiyƒr verbal noun of ixtƒr ‘to 
choose’ (root /x-y-r/), and itiyƒs verbal noun of itƒs ‘to become perplexed’ (root 
/-w-s/). Secondly, and again as Broselow (1976) points out for Cairene, while the

quality of the medial consonant of hollow verbs is reﬂ ected in the stem vowel in 
inﬂ ected forms of the basic verb, in derived verb forms VII and VIII the quality 
of the stem vowel does not change in the imperfect aspect, nor when the vowel 
is shortened in the perfect. Consider the following examples (prosthetic vowels 
added in forms VII–X):

Thirdly, a number of medial glide roots incorporated into the morphology of 
both dialects have the perfect aspect template CVCVC—with the medial glide real-
ized as a strong consonant. This indicates that any historic restriction on intervo-
calic glides in verb forms in the dialects has now been relaxed. In both dialects, 
‘strong w/y’ verbs are attested with the vocalic melodies /a/ and /i/ (and /u-i/ in 
San’ani). In (53a) are examples from Cairene;29 (53b) provides examples from

it may be found in nineteenth-century CE Cairene texts (M. Woidich p.c.).

6.5.7 Verbal derivatives
Verbal derivatives fall into two classes: those which continue to be actively derived 
in the dialects, and those which have become lexicalized. On the whole, it appears 
that derivational morphology which aﬀ ects the stem directly is, at least in Cairene, 
30 Normally t + I verbs do not have a verbal noun of their own, but take the form I verbal noun.

6.5 level-one verbal morphology
153
beginning to give way to a morphology which involves mainly aﬃ  xal elements. 
Where this is not the case, certain aspects of the derivational morphology have 
been simpliﬁ ed: with the exception of participles derived from the lexicalized hol-
low verbs, very few derived verbs have distinct active and passive participles (cf. 
Aboul-Fetouh 1969: 78).31 In most cases, participles of derived verbs are formed 
by the preﬁ xation of mi- to the imperfect stem. Where Badawi and Hinds (1986) 
list a passive participle alongside an active participle for a verb, it often has the 
Standard-looking preﬁ x mu- (as in murattab ‘salary’, murattal ‘chanted’ from rat-
til ‘to chant’, mursal ‘sent’ from ʔarsal ‘to send’). In some cases, the passive parti-
ciple diﬀ ers from the active participle only in the quality of the preﬁ x vowel (as 
in mitall ‘occupier’ versus mutall ‘occupied’). In addition, while San’ani often 
has diﬀ erent vocalisms for the perfect and imperfect aspect of derived verbs, in 
Cairene the vocalism of the imperfect stem of most verb forms (II, III, V, VI, most 
IX, most X, quadriliteral I and II) is identical to that of the perfect stem (cf. Abdel-
Massih 1975: 162, 187–9). For many derived verbs (VII, VIII, some IX, some 
X) in which the imperfect vocalism diﬀ ers from that of the perfect, the imperfect 
vocalic melody is /i/ throughout (as in itmasak–yitmisik ‘to be grasped’), so that 
these forms exhibit no complex vocalic melody in contrast to cognate forms in 
Standard Arabic.32
 
Lexicalized verbal derivatives include nouns of instrument formed on the 
pattern mif     cƒl (SA), muf     cƒl (CA) (miftƒ ‘key’ (SA), muftƒ ‘key’ (CA), for 
example) and, to a lesser extent, nouns of place formed on the pattern maf     cal, 
maf     cala (CA), maf     calih (SA), or mif     cƒlih (SA) (for instance, mafraj ‘large recep-
tion room’ (SA), misƒlih ‘launderette’ (SA), maktab ‘oﬃ  ce’, madrasa ‘school’ 
(CA)). Verbal derivatives which continue to be actively derived include the par-
ticiples and verbal nouns of most derived verbs. In the following section, I consider 
the derivation of verbal participles and verbal nouns in the two dialects.
6.5.7.1 Verbal participles of form I verbs
Form I is the only verbal form which regularly has both active and passive par-
ticiples. The active and passive participles of form I sound triliteral verbs take 
the same patterns in both dialects: the active participle has the anti-iambic pattern 
CaaCiC (McCarthy and Prince 1990a: 28 for Standard Arabic), and the passive par-
ticiple has the pattern maCCuuC. The template of the active participle is derived 
from that of the ﬁ nite verb by initial-mora reduplication33 (as for derivation of the 
derived verb forms II, III, and IV above).
31 Abdel-Massih presents patterns for passive as well as active participles for sample form VIII and 
X verbs (Abdel-Massih 1975: 188–9). This is probably due to the Standard nature of the verbs involved 
(itaram ‘to respect’ and istacmal ‘to use’).
32 The imperfect vocalic melody in the stem of Standard Arabic derived verbs (excluding V and VI) 
is /a-i/, as in: yudarrisu ‘he teaches’, yusƒﬁ ru ‘he travels’, yaštailu ‘he works’, yastacmilu ‘he uses’. 
The imperfect vocalic melody of Standard Arabic V and VI is /a/, as in: yatazawwaju ‘he gets married’, 
yata	ƒharu ‘he pretends’.
33 McCarthy and Prince’s mora preﬁ xation (1990a: 29).

morphology
154
The consonants of the ﬁ nite verb link with non-moraic positions on the template, 
while the vocalic melody of the active participle /a-i/ associates with the moraic 
slots, delinking the original vocalic melody of the verb. (The linking of the vocalic 
melody shown in progress.)
Verbs with ﬁ nal-weak consonants such as Cairene nisi ‘to forget’ lack a ﬁ nal con-
sonant and therefore fail to associate material with the ﬁ nal extrametrical slot in 
the active participle:
In San’ani, stem-ﬁ nal long vowels are maintained, and the active participle of nis¤ 
‘to forget’ is realized with a ﬁ nal long vowel, nƒs¤. In this case, I assume that mora-
reduplication applies to accommodate the ﬁ nal long vowel, since short ﬁ nal vow-
els are not attested in the dialect:
The passive participle of sound triliteral verbs has the pattern maCCuuC. This is 
an example of a level-one morphological process which combines aﬃ  xation with 
templatic transformation. The passive participle involves preﬁ xation of the syl-
lable mµ- on the prosodic template together with reduplication of the ﬁ nal mora of 
the ﬁ nite template. The vocalic melody of the passive participle, /a-u/, then associ-
ates with the moraic slots of the template. Reduplication of the ﬁ nal mora of the 
ﬁ nite template is attested in other areas of the morphology, including in the deriva-

tion of verbal nouns of some form I and most derived verb forms (see Section 
6.5.7.4). The form I passive participle is derived as follows:
Association of the consonants of the ﬁ nite verb and the passive participle vocalic 
melody /a-u/ with the template takes place as shown in (62).
The passive participle of ﬁ nal-weak verbs is derived as follows: ﬁ nal-weak verbs 
lack a ﬁ nal consonant, therefore the ﬁ nal extrasyllabic slot of the passive parti-
ciple template remains unﬁ lled. In Cairene the long vowel is shortened through 
mora deletion, since Cairene does not tolerate word-ﬁ nal long vowels, and the ﬁ nal 
vowel is realized as [i]: stem-ﬁ nal -u is restricted to loans from Standard Arabic, as 
in Cairene yabdu ‘it appears’ and San’ani yad  c¶ ‘he invokes God’, and loans from 
other languages.
In San’ani, the ﬁ nal-weak passive participle is derived as in Cairene with the excep-
tion that long vowels are attested word-ﬁ nally—thus, word-ﬁ nal vowel shortening 
does not take place—see (64).

The faclƒn adjective is very common in Cairene and in dialects of the Levant. In 
San’ani, it is restricted to loan words from other dialects of Arabic, particularly 
Cairene.34 In Cairene, the faclƒn adjective is generally derived from intransitive 
verbs, and indicates the attaining of a state by the subject.35 The faclƒn adjective is 
another example of a level-one morphological process which involves aﬃ  xation 
as well as templatic change. The fact that there is a templatic change, though small, 
indicates that the faclƒn adjective constitutes a level-one process. In addition, a 
number of faclƒn forms may take a broken plural pattern as an alternative to the 
sound plural ending, as in sakrƒn pl. sakƒra ‘intoxicated, drunk’. Since broken 
plural formation is also a level-one process, and since level-one processes precede 
level-two processes, this indicates that the faclƒn adjective is derived in the level-
one morphology. A semantic reason for considering derivation of the faclƒn ad-
jective to be a level-one process is that a number of intransitive form I verbs take 
the faclƒn adjective as the active participle either alongside, or in place of, the fƒ cil 
active participle. This indicates that faclƒn is derived at the same level as the fƒ cil 
active participle. Consider the examples of faclƒn active participles in (65).
(65) 
tacbƒn 
 ‘tired’ (from ticib ‘to become tired’)
 
xadlƒn 
 ‘numb’ (from xidil ‘to become numb’)
 
daryƒn 
 ‘aware, conscious’ (from diri ‘to become aware’)
 
xawyƒn 
 ‘empty’ (from xiwi ‘to become empty’)
 
xazyƒn 
 ‘shy’ (from xizi ‘to become shy’)
 
kabrƒn 
 ‘increased in size’ (from kibir ‘to increase in size’)
The faclƒn adjective is derived by mapping the consonants of an intransitive verb 
to the consonantal slots of a monosyllabic bimoraic template (a trochaic foot) and 
suﬃ  xation of -ƒn—see (66).

34 The few examples of San’ani faclƒn adjectives include malƒn ‘full’, alƒn ‘wrong’, jamdƒn 
‘ﬁ xed, motionless’ and galgƒn ‘worried’. However, the original forms of the latter two adjectives, jƒmid 
and galig, are more common than the -ƒn variants, and alƒn is probably an import.
35 In Standard Arabic, the faclƒn adjective is principally derived from facila intransitive verbs: 
cašƒn ‘thirsty’ from caiša ‘to be/become thirsty’ and abƒn ‘angry’ from aiba ‘to be/become angry’ 
(Wright 1971: 135–6).

This results in a word comprising two trochaic feet:
The vocalic melody /a/ of the stem (CaCC) could in theory either be lexically speci-
ﬁ ed36 or be acquired by spreading from the -ƒn suﬃ  x. Since -ƒn is attested in other 
areas of level-one morphology, while -¤n and -¶n are not attested at this level, I 
assume that -ƒn is a complex suﬃ  x in both dialects and is not analysable as two 
separate elements—a bimoraic template and the vocalic melody /a/. In Cairene, 
-ƒn is a common form I verbal noun ending where the pattern is CaCaC + ƒn:
(68) xafasƒn 
verbal noun of xafas ‘to thrust down’
 
amaƒn 
verbal noun of imi ~ umu ‘to go bad’
 
ratacƒn 
verbal noun of ratac ‘to indulge oneself’
 
raxaxƒn 
verbal noun of raxx ‘to pour down’
 
zaʔafƒn 
verbal noun of zaʔaf ‘to throw’
-ƒn is attested in other singular nouns derived from triliteral verbs:
(69) 
bunyƒn 
‘structure’ (root /b-n-y/)
 
buhtƒn 
‘falsehood’ (root /b-h-t/)
 
zaraʔƒn 
‘blueness’ (root /z-r-?/)
 
mazazƒn 
‘sourness, tartness’ (root /m-z/)
-ƒn is attested in adjectives and nouns derived from quadriliteral verbs:
(70) 
bahragƒn 
‘decorative head fringes of a bride’ (from bahrag ‘to doll up’)
 
turgumƒn 
‘ dragoman, authorized tourist guide’ (from targim ‘to inter-
pret’)
 
mazlaʔƒn 
‘railway crossing; (naut.) slip’
Finally, -ƒn functions as a suﬃ  x to the monosyllabic broken plural pattern Cu/iCC 
+ ƒn (see Section 6.6), which is derived from a number of diﬀ erent singular pat-
terns (Aboul-Fetouh 1969: 60)—see (71).

6.5.7.3 Verbal participles of derived verbs
Cairene rarely makes any phonological distinction between active and passive par-
ticiples of derived verbs.37 If the semantics of a verb allow it to take both an active 
and a passive participle, it is often the syntactic or pragmatic context alone that 
determines the voice of the participle. On the whole, verbal participles of derived 
ﬁ nite verbs are derived by preﬁ xation of the participle preﬁ x mi- (rarer mu-) to the 
ﬁ nite stem. Where the vocalic melody of the imperfect verb diﬀ ers from that of 
the perfect verb, as in forms IV, VII, VIII, some IX, and some X tokens, mi- is pre-
ﬁ xed to the imperfect stem. Derivation of the verbal participles of derived verbs in 
Cairene is, therefore, an instance of concatenative level-one morphology. Consider 
the examples in (73). In case of alternant patterns, the most common alternant is 
given ﬁ rst (prosthetic vowels added in the perfect of forms V–X).

In contrast to Cairene, San’ani continues to maintain a phonological distinction 
between the active and the passive participles in derived verb forms. The vocalic 
melody of the active participle stem is the same as that of the basic form I active 
participle /a-i/ (see (57)), while that of the passive participle is /a/. Today, the 
vowel of the participle preﬁ x varies between /u/ and /i/ in all derived forms, with 
the realization often depending on the identity of the ﬁ rst consonant of the stem 
(Watson 1993b: 437–44).38 The patterns for derived active and passive participles 
are given in (74).

6.5.7.4 Verbal nouns of derived verbs
Excepting minor diﬀ erences in verbal nouns of some derived weak verbs, the ver-
bal noun templates in Cairene are identical to those of Standard Arabic. The verbal 
noun of form II third weak verbs has been ‘Egyptianized’ and is not taCCiya of 
Standard Arabic,39 but taCCiyya, with y-strengthening (cf. Section 8.1.2). The t + 
I forms do not usually take a separate verbal noun (cf. above).
38 Describing San’ani in the 1930s, Rossi (1939: 30–1) claims the preﬁ x vowel of the derived active 
participle is realized as [u] for forms III, V, VI, and VII, and varies between [u] and [i] in form II.
39 The nominal feminine ending -a is traditionally analysed as compensating for the loss (or non-
realization) of the ﬁ nal weak root consonant (Wright 1971: 118).

As in Standard Arabic and the vast majority of other modern Arabic dialects, most 
verbal nouns (II, III, IV, VII, VIII, IX, X) are formed by lengthening the vowel of 
the ﬁ nal syllable through ﬁ nal-mora reduplication (see (60)).42 Of these, the major-
ity (most III tokens, IV, VII, VIII, IX, and X) have the verbal noun vocalic melody 
/i-a/ (the mirror-image of the active participle vocalic melody). Final-mora redu-
plication is attested in other areas of the morphology: in the derivation of the 
verbal noun of many form I verbs (for example, xur¶g ‘exit, going out’, dux¶l 
‘entry, going in’, dirƒs-a ‘learning’), the passive participle of form I verbs (see 
Section 6.5.7.1), the traditional noun of instrument (miCCaaC/muCCaaC), and 
a large number of de-verbal adjectives and nouns of the patterns CVCVVC and 
 CVCCVVC (for instance, sac¤d ‘happy’, saf¤r ‘ambassador’, sim¤n ‘fat’, sikk¤r 
‘alcoholic’, saffƒk ‘bloodthirsty’). Final-mora reduplication for verbal nouns is rep-
resented in (76).
The form III verbal noun citƒb is derived from its ﬁ nite verb cognate cƒtib ‘to 
rebuke’ through initial-mora deletion and ﬁ nal-mora reduplication, and by associa-
tion of the verbal noun vocalic melody /i-a/ with the moraic slots of the template, 
40 No stem-ﬁ nal -u in the dialects.  
41 No stem-ﬁ nal -u in the dialects.
42 The analysis here diﬀ ers from McCarthy and Prince (1990a: 37), in which they propose setting 
up a monosyllabic bimoraic non-ﬁ nite verb suﬃ  x which contrasts with their monomoraic ﬁ nite verb 
suﬃ  x in (31).

delinking the vocalic melody of the ﬁ nite verb. The latter part of this process is 
represented in (77).
The form IV verbal noun ʔi  cgƒb is derived from its ﬁ nite verb cognate ʔacgab ‘to 
please’ through ﬁ nal-mora reduplication and association of the verbal noun vocal-
ic melody /i-a/:
The form II verbal noun pattern taCCiiC diﬀ ers from that of all other forms in that 
it takes a non-moraic preﬁ x t- which does not constitute part of the ﬁ nite verb, but 
which is reminiscent of the Standard Arabic form V and VI detransitivizing preﬁ x; 
its vocalic melody, /a-i/, is also the mirror-image of that of most other derived ver-
bal nouns; and it fails to exhibit the medial gemination of the ﬁ nite verb. The rep-
resentation of Cairene tab¤s, verbal noun of abbis ‘to conﬁ ne, lock up’ is given 
in (79).
The alternative verbal noun pattern of form III (miCaaCaCa ~ muCaaCaCa) dif-
fers from most other verbal noun patterns in that it does not undergo the ﬁ nal-mora 
reduplication rule. In addition, it takes a preﬁ x mi- or, less commonly, mu-, and 
a suﬃ  x -a. Apart from the fact that the verbal noun vocalic melody /a/ diﬀ ers 
from that of the ﬁ nite verb /a-i/ in Cairene,43 derivation of the form III verbal noun

is an instance of entirely concatenative level-one morphology. Cairene mi  catba 
‘reproach, rebuke’ is derived as in (80).
In Cairene, -a- is subject to syncope in the environment CVVCaCV (see Section 
4.4.2.1), and the long vowel reduced before the resulting consonant cluster through 
CSS (see Section 4.4.1.3) to give, in this case, micatba ‘reproach, rebuke’.
As for form III muCaaCaCa, the verbal nouns of forms V (taCaCCuC) and VI 
(taCaaCuC) also fail to undergo ﬁ nal-mora reduplication, and the template of the 
verbal noun stem is identical to that of the ﬁ nite verb (CVCCVC). In this case, how-
ever, the derivation of the verbal noun is not so obviously an instance of concat-
enative morphology: ﬁ rstly, these patterns have neither the vocalic melody of the 
regular verbal noun patterns (/i-a/), nor the vocalic melody of their ﬁ nite cognates 
(/a-a/ or /a-i/): and secondly, form V and VII verbal nouns begin with a non-moraic 
t, while their ﬁ nite verb cognates begin with a moraic t-:

It appears that form V and VI verbal nouns have either been borrowed directly 
from Standard Arabic, which shares the patterns cited above, or that they have spe-
ciﬁ c derivative patterns taCaCCuC and taCaaCuC into which all form V and form 
VI ﬁ nite verbs are inserted. Since the few form V and form VI verbal nouns tend 
to be high-style lexemes, I assume that Cairene form V and VI verbal nouns are 
lexical borrowings from Standard Arabic.45

45 I assume for Standard Arabic (and for Cairene should it emerge that form V and VI verbal noun 
formation continues to be active) that the vocalic melody associates from left to right within the stem 
of the verbal noun (CaCCuC and CaaCuC), and that the leftmost vowel then spreads into the preﬁ x.
46 With the exception that the preﬁ xed form is realized with a medial long vowel and syncope does 
not remove the following short vowel. While Cairene has patterns ﬁ cƒl and mifacla ~ mufacla, San’ani 
has the patterns ﬁ cƒl and mufƒcala.

The San’ani form II verbal noun xizzƒn is derived from its ﬁ nite cognate xazzan

vocalic melody with the remaining moraic slots of the template:
Form V verbal nouns are also derived from the ﬁ nite verb through ﬁ nal-mora redu-
plication. I then assume that the verbal noun vocalic melody associates from left to 
right within the stem (irrƒk) and that the initial vocalic element /i/ subsequently 
associates leftwards into the remaining moraic slot on the template. This is illus-
trated in the derivation of tiirrƒk from taarrak in (84).

47 The patterns for form II (CiCCaaC) and the form V (tiCiCCaaC) are given in Wright (1971) as

(Wright 1971i: 116).

the form II triliteral verbal noun, and the one for the form II quadriliteral verbal noun is identical to that 
of the form V triliteral verbal noun: afaf ‘to bark’ and aswal ‘to wash up’ have the verbal nouns

6.6 LEVEL-ONE NOMINAL MORPHOLOGY
Under level-one nominal morphology, I consider the formation of broken plurals 
in the two dialects. McCarthy and Prince’s observations for broken plural forma-
tion in Standard Arabic apply largely to the dialects examined here. This process 
conﬁ rms the third thesis of Prosodic Morphology in (19c), namely that ‘mor-
phological operations may be circumscribed by prosodic criteria as well as by 
the more familiar morphological ones. In particular, the minimal word within a 
domain may be selected as the locus of morphological transformation in lieu of 
the whole domain.’ Thus, a morphological operation may select a prosodic unit for 
the locus of morphological transformation which is only a part and not the whole 
of the morpheme to which that morphological transformation applies.
There are a large number of broken plural patterns in Cairene and San’ani. 
When the patterns are considered in terms of foot types, however, they fall into 
three major patterns: iambic, trochaic, and monosyllabic, with an additional ‘other’ 
set (McCarthy and Prince 1990b: 213 for Standard Arabic). In (85a) broken plural 
patterns for Cairene are listed, in (85b) those for San’ani.

been widened to include Ci- and Cu- in /CiCiC + a/, /CuCuC/, etc. In contrast to CuCaaC 
and CiCaaC plurals, very few instances of non-metathesized CaCaaC plurals exist either 
in Standard Arabic or in the dialects considered here. The example McCarthy and Prince 
give of a CaCaaC plural, saaab ‘clouds’ (1990b: 218) is a collective and not a plural, and 
is given as such in Wehr’s dictionary (Wehr 1974). Šabƒb ‘youths’ is given as one of three 
possible plural patterns for šƒbb ‘youth’ in Wehr, but is also listed as a collective.
The key invariant uniting the plurals in the leftmost column is the initial iambic 
sequence CVCVV +. Trochaic and monosyllabic broken plural patterns in col-
umns two and three impose a trochee or monosyllable (CVCC and therefore also 
a trochee) template to which the root associates. Only the ‘other’ patterns fail to 
constitute a metrical foot.
In terms of the occurrence of the various plural types, the monosyllabic pat-
terns are rare in both dialects, as they are in Standard Arabic. CuCC (~ CiCC) is 
almost exclusively the plural pattern of aCCaC adjectives in both dialects, as in: 
asmar–sumr ‘brown’, amar–umr ‘red’, abya	–b¤	 ‘white’ (SA), agrab–gurb 
‘mangy’ (CA); and although CVCC + aan derives the plural from a variety of singu-
lar patterns (see Section 6.5.7.2), the actual number of items involved is relatively 
few. Of the ‘other’ patterns, CuCCaaC and CiCCaaC are generally restricted to lex-
icalized CaaCiC participles, as in kƒtib–kuttƒb ‘writer/s’, ƒkim–ukkƒm ‘ruler/s, 
judge/s’, Cairene rƒgil–riggƒl-a ‘man/men’ and sƒyis–siyyƒs~suyyƒs ‘groom/s’, 
and San’ani jƒhil–juhhƒl ‘child/children’, (cƒyil)–ciyyƒl ‘boy/s’; and the anti-iam-
bic pattern CiCwaC ~ CuCwaC in San’ani derives the plural of a few CaCiiC 
and CaCuuC singulars, as in šar¤–širwa ‘cassette/s’, nag¤l–nigwal ‘mountain 
pass/es’, ar¤g–urwag ‘road/s’, saf¶d–sifwad ‘wooden axle/s’. The trochaic pat-
terns are predictable in some lexical classes in both dialects. Cairene CiCiC-a, for 
example, is the plural pattern today of several CuCaaC and CiCaaC singulars and 
a few CVCVC singulars, as in uƒn–iin-a ‘horse/s’, lisƒn–lisina ‘tongue/s’, 
ligƒm–ligim-a ‘bridle/s’, urƒb–irib-a ‘crow/s’, sabat–sibit-a ‘basket/s’, anaš–
iniš-a ‘snake/s’; and CuCaC, CiCaC, and CiCiC are the plural patterns of many 
CVCC-a/CVCC-ih singulars in both dialects, as in Cairene idw-a–idaw ‘horse-
shoe’, uʔn-a–uʔan ‘injection’, and San’ani nukt-ih–nukat ‘joke’, sufr-ih–sufar 
‘dining table’, li  cb-ih–li  cib ‘game/s’. In contrast to the monosyllabic and trochaic 
patterns, the iambic pattern derives the plural of a very wide range of singulars and 
extents to loan words far more regularly than the other patterns. Examples
appear in (86).

For Standard Arabic, McCarthy and Prince show that the iambic broken plural 
is derived in the following way: the minimal word (a quantitative trochee, Fqu) 
is parsed out from the left-edge of the singular noun and mapped onto an iambic 
template (Fi). The residue of the singular (the portion which remains after Fqu has 
been parsed out) is then added back in the plural template, and remains prosodic-
ally unchanged. In minimal bimoraic nouns and in a few non-minimal nouns and 
adjectives (the marked case), the vocalic melody of the plural is lexically speciﬁ ed 
(as /a/, /i-a/, /u-a/, /u/, or /i/). In a few bimoraic nouns and non-minimal nouns (the 
unmarked case), the vocalic melody of the plural is /a-i/. The unmarked vocalic 
melody of the broken plural is thus the mirror image of the vocalic melody of 
derived verbal nouns (see Section 6.5.7.4).
In the following paragraphs I begin by considering the derivation of an iambic 
plural with a marked vocalic melody from a minimal (bimoraic) singular. I then 
consider derivations of plurals of non-minimal singulars which take the unmarked 
vocalic melody /a-i/. Within this category, I examine plural derivations from singu-

lars which end in a light (CVC) syllable and from singulars which end in a heavy 
(CVVC) syllable. I then discuss plural derivation from singulars with an initial long 
vowel (CVV), and plural derivation from singulars of the pattern CVCVVC. Final-
ly, I look at bimoraic singulars which take the vocalic melody /a-i/ in the plural.
Let us look ﬁ rst at the derivation of the plural of the bimoraic noun malik 
‘king’, attested in both Cairene and San’ani, which has the marked plural vocalic 
melody /u/.
(87) 
 Fqu (mali) is parsed out from the singular and mapped to Fi. The conso-
nants associate with the obligatory onset slots:
The plural vocalic melody (/u/ in this case) is mapped on to the moraic slots of the 
plural template in a ‘feature-changing’ manner, overwriting the original melodic 
material of the base (/a-i/) (McCarthy and Prince 1990b: 245–7):
The residue of the singular, /k/, remains prosodically unchanged and is right-con-
catenated to the iambic foot, yielding mul¶k ‘kings’.

Let us look now at plurals of non-minimal nouns which take the unmarked /a-i/ 
plural melody. In the case of a quadriconsonantal singular with a ﬁ nal CVC syl-
lable, such as Cairene maglis ‘council’ (San’ani majlis), Fqu (in this case, mag/
maj) is parsed from the word and mapped onto Fi.
The vocalic melody associates as follows: /a/ of the melody associates with the 
moraic slots of the iambic template, overwriting the vocalic melody of the singular 
(vacuously in this case, since the melody of the singular is /a/). The residue of the 
parsed-out word, a CVC syllable, remains prosodically unchanged, and is right-
concatenated to the iamb. The remainder of the plural vocalic melody, /i/, associ-
ates with the moraic slots of the residue, overwriting the melody of the singular 
(again vacuously in the case of maglis), to yield magƒlis ‘councils’.
The prosodic parsing-out of the initial two-mora sequence (the minimal phono-
logical word, though not a word in any other sense as it occurs here) of the singular 
explains the fact that the ﬁ rst part of the plural is iambic, while the third syllable 
(if there is a third syllable) remains prosodically unchanged from that of the 
singular. When a quadriconsonantal singular has a ﬁ nal CVC syllable, this syl-
lable is realized as CVC in the plural (with /i/ of the plural vocalic melody 
overwriting the original melodic material of the base), as in maglis–magƒlis 
‘council/s’ (CA), maktab–makƒtib ‘oﬃ  ce/s’, mafraj–mafƒrij ‘reception room/s’ 
(SA), bardag–barƒdig ‘drinking glass/es’ (SA). When the residue of a quadricon-
sonantal singular is CVVC, the ﬁ nal syllable is realized as CVVC in the plural, 
and /i/ of the plural vocalic melody spreads to ﬁ ll the two moraic positions, as 
in garg¶š–garƒg¤š ‘bonnet/s’ (SA), an¶r–ana¤r ‘horse-drawn cab/s’ (CA) and

miftƒ–mafƒt¤ (muftƒ–mafat¤ (CA)) ‘key/s’. In the derivation of mafƒt¤, Fqu 
(mif) is parsed from the word and mapped onto Fi:
The vocalic melody of the original base is overwritten by /a/ of the plural vocalic 
melody.
The residue of the parsed-out word is right-concatenated to the iamb, and is then 
subject to melodic overwriting by /i/ of the plural melody:
In Cairene, stress is assigned to the rightmost heavy syllable, and the leftmost long 
vowel is subject to unstressed long vowel shortening (see Section 9.1.1) to produce, 
in this case, mafat¤. In San’ani, both long vowels are maintained.
When the singular takes a suﬃ  x, such as the feminine -a (-ih in San’ani) or 
the singular -¤ suﬃ  x in San’ani (see Section 7.2.4), the suﬃ  x is overlooked in the 
plural and does not count as part of the residue. This is exempliﬁ ed in Cairene sil-
sil-a pl. salƒsil ‘chain/s’, maktab-a pl. makƒtib ‘library/ies’, madras-a pl. madƒris

muguf-¤ pl. maƒgif ‘sorghum head/s’.
When the consonantism of the parsed-out Fqu is insuﬃ  cient to ﬁ ll the onset 
slots of Fi, the empty onset is ﬁ lled by a default consonant /w/ (cf. McCarthy and 
Prince 1990b: 249 for Standard Arabic). In words such as xƒtam–xawƒtim ‘ring/s’, 
mƒni c–mawƒni c ‘obstacle/s’, ƒrik–awƒrik ‘withers (of a horse)’ (CA), gƒr¤–
gawƒr¤ ‘garry cart/s’ (SA), nƒdam–nawƒdim ‘human being/s’ (SA) and gƒm¶s–
gawƒm¤s ‘dictionary/ies’ (SA), the parsed-out material, Fqu, is a consonant plus 
a long vowel (xƒ, mƒ, ƒ, nƒ, gƒ). The consonant associates with the onset of the 
leftmost syllable. Since the second mora of the singular associates with the second 
portion of a long vowel rather than a consonant, the rightmost onset of the plural 
iambic template cannot be ﬁ lled by the contents of the parsed-out material. To 
adhere to the requirement that syllables take an initial onset, a default consonant, 
/w/, associates with the onset of the second syllable. This is exempliﬁ ed in (95) in 
the derivation of xawƒtim ‘rings’.
Once the residue becomes accessible and melodic overwriting takes place, the 
output is xawƒtim ‘rings’. The Consonantal Default Rule is given in (96), from 
 McCarthy and Prince (1990b: 249):
(96) Consonantal Default Rule
 
0 → w, when required by syllabic well-formedness.52, 53
The derivation of the iambic plural from singular nouns of the pattern CVCV-
VC (+ a/ih) is a particularly interesting case within Prosodic Morphology. This is 
because the two-mora unit which is parsed out from the singular corresponds to 
neither a trochaic foot nor a syllable (McCarthy and Prince 1990b: 249–50). Con-

52 This default rule applies only within the iamb in broken plural derivation. Outside the iamb, a 
separate default rule applies in Standard Arabic inserting /ʔ/.
53 /w/ also functions as a default consonant when sub-minimal stems take a following plural or ad-
jectival suﬃ  x. Thus, San’ani san-ih ‘year’, which takes the {feminine plural} suﬃ  x -ƒt (see Table 7.2), 
is made bimoraic by the addition of -a- plus an onset /w/ to give sanawƒt ‘years’ (cf. also Section 
7.3.2).

In all other cases of iambic broken plural production, the two-mora unit parsed out 
from the singular corresponds to a prosodic constituent of the base—the ﬁ rst syl-
lable (bank–bun¶k ‘bank/s’, maktab–makƒtib ‘oﬃ  ce/s’, xa¯tam–xawƒtim ‘ring/s’). 
When the singular has the templatic pattern CVCVVC, the parsed-out portion 
of the singular—CVCV—cuts halfway into the second syllable (h abiib–abƒyib 
‘loved person/s’, gaziir-a–gazƒyir ‘island/s’). The parsing out of a two-mora unit 
appears to operate on as yet stressless representations: the parsed-out portion is 
neither a syllable nor a foot; moreover, the residue of the base is not a syllable 
either (-VC). McCarthy and Prince cite this as evidence that the parse is achieved 
on moraic structure alone and not on any other prosodic constituent, conﬁ rming 
that the minimal word in Arabic is deﬁ ned in terms of moras and not in terms of 
syllables. Consider the derivation of San’ani madƒyi  c from madƒ c-ah. The initial 
two-mora portion is parsed from the word and mapped onto Fi:
/a/ of the plural melody spreads to the moraic positions in the iamb, in this case

The residue of the parsed-out word lacks a potential onset; therefore, the features 
associated with the rightmost vowel of the plural vocalic melody, /i/, associate with 
the onset of the ﬁ nal syllable once the residue becomes accessible, to give y:54
Finally, let us examine plural formation from bimoraic singulars which take 
the plural vocalic melody /a-i/. McCarthy and Prince (1990b: 246, 250) claim that 
/i/ of the /a-i/ melody associates to the moraic slots of the residue if and only if 
the residue contains moraic material. If the residue contains no moraic material, 
/i/ fails to associate and is subject to Stray Erasure. In this way, they are able to 
claim that the most common plural pattern of minimal singulars, /CaCaaC/, has 
the unmarked plural vocalic melody /a-i/ (McCarthy and Prince 1990b: 250). /a/ 
associates with moraic material within the iamb. The residue, a single consonant, 
is right-concatenated to the iamb. /i/ of the vocalic melody cannot associate due 
to the absence of moraic material in the residue and is subject to Stray Erasure. 
According to this analysis, akƒm ‘judgements’ is derived from ukm as follows:
(101) 
uk 
parse out trochee at left edge

map to iambic template
 
akaa 
melodic overwriting by /a/
 
akaam

Ca- metathesis
However, both Standard Arabic and Cairene and San’ani have a few bimoraic sin-
gulars which take plurals with the /a-i/ plural melody, and we know this because 
the ﬁ nal element of the vocalic melody does surface to the right of the iamb. The 
vowel /i/ is realized as long in San’ani, which does not accept domain-ﬁ nal short 
vowels, and as short in Cairene, which does. Examples of such nouns from San’ani 
include gahw-ih–gahƒw¤ ‘coﬀ ee/s’ and kiliy-ih–kalƒw¤ ‘kidney/s’. Ex amples from 
Cairene include bikr–bakƒri ‘ﬁ rst born/s’, raw-a–raƒwi ‘foam, froth’, raxw–
raxƒwi ‘whiplash/es’ and asw-a–asƒwi ‘pebble/s’. If the ﬁ nal element of the 
plural vocalic melody were subject to Stray Erasure when the residue contained 
no moraic material, each of these examples would be realized without ﬁ nal /i/. 
54 In Standard Arabic, the onset to the residue is ﬁ lled by a glottal stop (cf. McCarthy and Prince 
1990b: 250). The weakness of the glottal stop has resulted in features associated with the [dorsal] vowel, 
/i/, associating with the onset in most modern Arabic dialects.

6.7 conclusion
173
Instead, it appears that /i/ of the plural melody right-concatenates to the iamb when 
the residue contains no moraic material. Under this analysis, Cairene bakƒri is 
derived from bikr accordingly:
(102) 
bik

bikii 
map to iambic template
 
bakaa 
melodic overwriting by /a/
 
bakaar

bakaari 
right-concatenate /i/
In contrast to the predominance of the /a/ vocalic melody in plurals derived from 
minimal singulars, /a/ is an uncommon vocalic melody in plurals derived from 
non-minimal singulars. Cairene has a few y-ﬁ nal non-minimal singulars, usually 
of the pattern CaCiyy-a, which take an iambic plural with the vocalic melody /a/. 
Examples include abiyy-a–abƒy-a ‘young girls’, xaiyy-a–xaƒy-a ‘sin’, sariyy-
a–sarƒy-a ‘company/ies of soldiers’, and raciyy-a–racƒy-a ‘ﬂ ock/s’, ‘herd/s’. The 
claim that /CaCaaC/ plurals have the vocalic melody /a-i/ with /i/ subject to Stray 
Erasure fails to capture the fact that the plural vocalic melody /a-i/ is unmarked 
in the derivation of plurals of non-minimal singulars, but marked in the derivation 
of plurals of minimal singulars; and that the plural melody /a/ is unmarked in the 
derivation of plurals of minimal singulars, but marked in the derivation of plurals 
of non-minimal singulars.
6.7 CONCLUSION
At the beginning of this chapter, I argued that the prosodic morphology of Cairene 
and San’ani should be analysed in terms of two morphological levels. I then 
described a number of level-one processes in the two dialects. In general, level-
one processes equate with the nonconcatenative morphology and level-two proc-
esses with the concatenative morphology. However, I show that a number of 
morphological processes which demand to be analysed as level one involve at least 
a limited degree of concatenation. These include derivation of the form I passive 
participle, the faclƒn adjective, participles of derived verbs, the muCaaCaCa form 
III verbal noun, and form V and VI verbal nouns. In Cairene, aspects of the non-
concatenative morphology appear to be giving way to a concatenative morphology. 
This is seen in the lack of productivity of form VIII (inﬁ x -t-) verbs as opposed to 
the productivity of t- preﬁ x verbs, and the fact that the distinction between the pas-
sive and active participles of derived verbs—historically marked by a diﬀ erence 
in the vocalic melody—is now largely determined by the syntactic or pragmatic 
context. By contrast, the main non-concatenative processes are maintained in the 
more conservative dialect of San’ani.
The sheer richness of Arabic non-concatenative morphology and restrictions of 
space have forced me to limit the coverage of this chapter. Within the section on 
verbal morphology, I have not dealt in detail with the apophonic passive in San’ani. 

morphology
174
Nor have I dealt with the fact that the early loss of the apophonic passive in Cairene 
has left a gap in the non-concatenative system, a gap which has allowed a purely 
vowel-based distinction between a closed list of intransitive and transitive form I 
verbs: in this dialect, a number of form I transitive verbs with the vocalic melody 
/a/ in the perfect aspect have developed from an earlier form IV verb and now con-
trast with intransitive verbs with the vocalic melody /i/; to a lesser extent, intransi-
tive verbs appear to have developed from a basic transitive counterpart. Within 
the section on nominal morphology, I focused exclusively on the formation of the 
broken plural and did not consider the formation of the diminutive, a decision 
motivated by the relative rareness of the diminutive in both dialects and the fact
that the diminutive in San’ani is restricted to a few lexical items and therefore no 
longer productive.

MORPHOLOGY 2
This chapter examines the level-two morphology. In contrast to level-one morph-
ology, level-two morphology is wholly concatenative, involving suﬃ  xes and preﬁ x-
es which are aﬃ  xed to the outcome of level-one morphology. In general, level-two 
morphemes are continuous morphemes which are aﬃ  xed in a linear order to the 
stem or word. One exception to this is the discontinuous negative morpheme 
ma . . . -š in Cairene and mƒ . . . -š in San’ani, which negates verbs, independent pro-
nouns, and preposition + object suﬃ  x phrases. Another arguable exception is the 
imperfect subject markers which are discontinuous for the second and third plural 
and second feminine singular inﬂ ections. However, here we could argue that these 
markers comprise two elements: in the case of the plural markers, a person preﬁ x 
(that is, second (ti-)/third (yi-)) and a plural number suﬃ  x in Cairene (-u ~ -um), 
plural/gender suﬃ  x in San’ani (that is, masculine -¶, feminine -ayn). The set of ver-
bal level-two morphemes comprises the subject agreement aﬃ  xes, object suﬃ  xes, 
future and habitual preﬁ xes, and the negators. Basic nominal level-two morphemes 
comprise the adjectival suﬃ  x -¤, the adverbial suﬃ  x -an (mainly in CA), the femi-
nine singular1 -ih (SA), -a (CA), the dual -ayn (SA), -¢n (CA), the masculine and 
feminine plural endings -¤n and -ƒt, and the possessive pronoun  suﬃ  xes.
Cairene has a far richer level-two nominal and adjectival morphology than 
San’ani, partly because it has a richer supply of native adjectival and nominal suf-
ﬁ xes, and partly because it has been inﬂ uenced by other dialects and languages. 
Cairo has had a very chequered history. In 1835, a severe plague wiped out at 
least one third of its population (Woidich 1997: 192, n. 25). The population loss 
caused by the plague was quickly made up by people from the countryside, mainly 
from the Delta but also from Upper Egypt. These migrants brought with them their 
own dialect features. Since the later nineteenth century, Cairo has attracted a huge 
number of migrants (Woidich 1997: 191–2), leading to further changes in the 
dialect. Over the centuries, Egypt has also been under the inﬂ uence of several 
foreign powers, each of which has left its own linguistic traces. In a few cases, 
these linguistic traces are not simply lexemes but separable morphemes which are 
actively used today in noun and adjective formation. The main foreign separable 
morphemes come from Turkish and include the nominal morphemes -gi, -lik and 
-xƒna and the adjectival morpheme -li.
1 In both dialects, this ending is also used as a nominalizer and in the formation of certain masculine 
plural forms such as ʔasƒtiih (SA), ʔasatza (CA) ‘professors’ (cf. Section 6.6), and makwagiyya (CA) 
‘people who trade in ironing clothes’. For shorthand in Table 7.2, I refer to -a/-ih as feminine.

morphology 2
176
In this chapter I consider ﬁ rst the verbal level-two morphemes, then the basic 
nominal and adjectival level-two morphemes. Within these sections, I also exam-
ine allomorphic variation. Finally, I discuss non-basic nominal and adjectival level-
two morphemes in the dialects.
7.1 LEVEL-TWO VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
Table 7.1 (see pp. 178–9) presents level-two verbal morphemes in the two dialects. 
The morphemes are numbered according to the order in which they are aﬃ  xed to 
the stem. Cairene diﬀ ers from San’ani in that it makes no gender distinction in the 
second and third person plural subject and object suﬃ  xes. San’ani makes a distinc-
tion between the verbal preﬁ x used for the ﬁ rst person (šƒ- or cad- future, bayn- 
habitual/continuous) and that used for all other persons (ca- future, bi- habitual/
continuous),2 whereas Cairene makes no such distinction (a- future, bi- habitual/
continuous for all persons). Cairene diﬀ ers from San’ani in that it may make a 
distinction between the negation of a verb with the future or habitual/continuous 
preﬁ x (in which case the particle miš, far less commonly muš, may be used)3 and 
the negation of a verb which does not have a future or habitual preﬁ x (in which 
case the discontinuous negator ma . . . -š is obligatory, cf. Abdel-Massih 1975: 
146).4

2 In common with a number of other Yemeni dialects spoken in the central region of northern Yemen 
(Behnstedt 1985: 131, 132).
3 Miš ~ muš is obligatory today with the future preﬁ x.
4 Aboul-Fetouh (1969) says that miš may also occur with the bare imperfect or the perfect (as in 
miš yiktib ‘he isn’t writing’ and miš katab ‘he didn’t write’) and that ‘the alternation between ma . . . -š 
and miš is either in free variation or idiolectal’. There is regional variation as well: in the dialect of 
 Shargiyya province, miš + perfect is very common (M. Woidich, p.c.). In contrastive negation and 
rhetorical questions miš may be used with all tenses.

Level-two morphemes are aﬃ  xed to the outcome of level-one processes. Since 
level-one processes result minimally in a minimal phonological word, the Prosod-
ic Morphology Hypothesis predicts that level-two morphemes will be aﬃ  xed to a 
form which is at least the size of the minimal phonological word—a quantitative 
(moraic) foot. In the case of Cairene darasu ‘they learnt’ in (4a), the stem is a disyl-
labic trochee; in the case of abbu ‘they loved’ in (4b), the stem is a monosyllabic 
trochee.

When consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes are aﬃ  xed to the perfect verbal stem, the 
pre-suﬃ  xal stem is minimally one iambic foot, and maximally two (monosyllabic) 
trochaic feet (see Section 6.5.1).
When the pre-consonantal perfect stem exceeds the size of one bimoraic foot but 
is less than two feet, as in the case of hollow verbs (of the structure CaaC) and dou-
bled verbs (of the structure CaCC), the stem is adapted to conform to the complete 
foot requirement. For hollow verbs, the stem was reduced historically by CSS (see 
Section 4.4.1.3) to give a single bimoraic trochee, as in the derivation of Cairene 
sibt ‘I/you m.s. left’.
The process which reduced the pre-consonantal stem of the hollow verb is no long-
er productive, and today the hollow verb stem has two allomorphs: CVC before 
consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes and CaaC before null or vowel-initial subject 
 suﬃ  xes.
The perfect stem CaCC of doubled verbs has the appearance of a monomoraic 
trochaic foot. In Standard Arabic, the doubled verb stem has two allomorphs: 
CaCaC before consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes and CaCC before vowel-initial 
subject suﬃ  xes. It is assumed that the CaCC form is derived from CaCaC by 
some type of Double Rule (see Section 6.5.6.2). In dialects of Arabic today, the 
stem of the doubled verb has a single form—CaCC. When vowel-initial subject 
suﬃ  xes are aﬃ  xed, the geminate consonant is syllabiﬁ ed in the rhyme of the left-
most syllable and as the onset of the rightmost syllable. The pre-vocalic stem is

therefore a monosyllabic bimoraic trochee. This is exempliﬁ ed in Cairene abbu 
‘they loved’.
When consonant-initial subject suﬃ  xes are aﬃ  xed to a doubled stem, the stem can-
not be reduced as it can in the case of the hollow verb. Instead a special allomorphy 
rule exists in all dialects to augment the stem template. On analogy with ﬁ nal-weak 
verbs with the vocalic melody /a/ (see Section 6.5.6.1), a bimoraic adjunct was 
added which was realized historically as *-ay-.
In Cairene, historical coalescence of *-ay- resulted in a long mid vowel /¢/. In 
San’ani, coalescence did not apply at any stage in the development of the dialect 
and the allomorphic adjunct continues to be realized as /ay/. The *-ay- allomorphy 
rule results in a disyllabic unit of two trochaic feet. Consider the representations 
of San’ani abbayt in (9a) and Cairene abb¢t in (9b).
The suﬃ  xed form I doubled verb now shares a double-trochee base with sound and 
ﬁ nal-weak form II and San’ani form III verbs.5

5 The long vowel in form III verbs in Cairene is subject to unstressed vowel shortening when con-
sonant-initial suﬃ  xes are added (see Section 9.1.1). Thus, /sƒﬁ r + t/ is realized as saﬁ rt. Prosodically, 
this changes a double trochaic stem into an iambic stem.

7.1.2 Afﬁ xation of further morphemes
The remaining concatenative morphemes in level-two morphology also aﬃ  x min-
imally to the minimal prosodic word, as exempliﬁ ed in the aﬃ  xation of object suf-
ﬁ xes in Cairene—see (12).
Suﬃ  xation is subject to the additional constraint that a morpheme may not be 
suﬃ  xed to a form ending in a short vowel. In San’ani, short morpheme-ﬁ nal vow-
els are rarely attested, and therefore the constraint on pre-suﬃ  xal short vowels 
applies vacuously. In Cairene, pre-suﬃ  x lengthening takes place on aﬃ  xation of 
a suﬃ  x or clitic to a morpheme ending in a short vowel. Pre-suﬃ  x lengthening is 
represented as mora reduplication (see also Section 8.1.1), as in (13).

In Cairene, when a consonant-initial object suﬃ  x, the negative suﬃ  x, or a prep-
osition plus object suﬃ  x is concatenated to a morpheme ending in VCC, syllable 
structure is maintained through epenthesis, as in abbina ‘he loved us’, yiibbukum 
‘he loves you pl.’, ma yibbiš ‘he doesn’t love’, and abbaha6 ‘he loved her’ 
 (Broselow 1976: 126–7; cf. Section 4.4.1.1). When the pre-suﬃ  xal element ends 
in VVC, the long vowel is subject to CSS to prevent a word-internal CVVC syl-
lable (see Section 4.4.1.3, cf. Section 9.1.1).

6 The epenthetic vowel is realized as [i] in non-harmonic environments and as [u] when the follow-

epenthesis is optional (see Section 4.4.1.3): both abbaytukum and abbaytkum ‘I 
loved you m.pl.’, jarraytalahƒ and jarraytlahƒ ‘I took for her’ are attested. When 
the negative suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to a perfect verb ending in a consonant plus -t of the 
{ﬁ rst person singular} or {second person masculine singular}, no epenthesis takes 
place, resulting in a three-consonant cluster (see Section 4.3); when the negative 
suﬃ  x -š is aﬃ  xed to a verb ending in a geminate consonant, degemination occurs 
(see Section 8.1.6). The aﬃ  xation of the negative suﬃ  x is exempliﬁ ed in (16).

7.1.3 Allomorphy
Level-two verbal morphemes display a limited amount of allomorphy in the dia-
lects. In Section 7.1.3.1, I consider allomorphy in San’ani vowel-initial subject suf-
ﬁ xes. In Section 7.1.3.2, I discuss allomorphy in the object suﬃ  xes.
7.1.3.1 Allomorphy: San’ani subject sufﬁ xes
The perfect aspect subject suﬃ  xes take the forms given in Table 7.1 when aﬃ  xed 
to consonant-ﬁ nal verb stems, and consonant-initial suﬃ  xes are invariant irrespec-
tive of the prosodic structure of the verb stem. In San’ani, however, vowel-initial 
subject suﬃ  xes exhibit allomorphic variation which is dependent on whether the 
stem ends in a consonant or a vowel.
In the case of CiCii stems, the vowel-initial suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed directly to the stem. 
To adhere to the requirement that a syllable take an onset, glide formation takes 
place by which the vocalic matrix of the long vowel is dissociated from the right-
most mora and associates with the onset of the rightmost syllable (see Section 
8.1.4). This is illustrated below in the derivation of nisiyat ‘she forgot’ (cf. nisiy¶ 
‘they m. forgot’, nisiyayn ‘they f. forgot’).
In the case of aﬃ  xation to stems ending in /ƒ/, the long stem vowel is deleted on 
aﬃ  xation of a vowel-initial subject suﬃ  x, as in /ramƒ + ayn/ > ramayn ‘they f. 
threw’ (see Section 8.1.4). The other vowel-initial morphemes also have distinct 
allomorphs after vowel-ﬁ nal stems: {third person masculine plural} has the allo-
morph /aw/ and {third person feminine singular} the allomorph /it/, as in (18).

katab¶ ‘they m. wrote’

Historically, the /aw/ allomorph probably derives from historical coalescence of 
/a/ of the stem and /u/ of the {masculine plural} suﬃ  x, and the [dorsal] vowel in 
the {third person feminine singular} /it/ allomorph may reﬂ ect the quality of the 
lost glide of the verbal stem, *y.
In the imperfect aspect, subject suﬃ  xes which take a long vowel—-¶ {mascu-
line plural} and -¤ {second person feminine singular}—when aﬃ  xed to a conso-
nant-ﬁ nal stem take a diphthong allomorph—/aw/ and /ay/ respectively—when 
aﬃ  xed to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem, irrespective of the quality of the ﬁ nal stem vowel. As 
in the perfect aspect, the ﬁ nal stem vowel is deleted on aﬃ  xation of vowel-initial 
subject suﬃ  xes.

tiktub¤ ‘you f.s. write’
 
yilbas¶ ‘they m. wear’ 
tilbas¤ ‘you f.s. wear’
7.1.3.2 Allomorphy: object sufﬁ xes
In Cairene and San’ani, vowel-initial object suﬃ  xes have a non-vowel-initial allo-
morph when aﬃ  xed to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem. These are listed in Table 7.1 as post-V. 
Thus, while the object suﬃ  x {second person masculine singular} in San’ani is real-
ized as /ak/ when suﬃ  xed to a consonant-ﬁ nal stem, as in absartak ‘I saw you 
m.s.’, it is realized as /k/ when suﬃ  xed to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem, as in lig¤k ‘he found 
you m.s.’. In Cairene, the {second person feminine singular} object suﬃ  x is real-
ized as /ik/ in post-consonantal position, as in šuftik ‘I saw you f.s.’, but as /ki/ in 
post-vocalic position, as in šaf¶ki ‘they saw you f.s.’.
The object suﬃ  xes {second person feminine singular} and {third person mascu-
line singular} are subject to another type of allomorphy in Cairene to the left of the 
negative suﬃ  x. In post-consonant position, {second person feminine singular} has 
the allomorph /iki/ before the negative suﬃ  x, and the ﬁ nal vowel of the pronoun 
suﬃ  x is subject to pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening (see (13)), as in (20).
(20) 
šuftik 
‘I saw you f.s.’ 
ma šuftik¤š 
‘I didn’t see you f.s.’
In post-vocalic position, the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x takes

gular}, the ﬁ nal vowel of the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x is 
subject to pre-suﬃ  x lengthening. Consider the following examples.

7.2 LEVEL-TWO NOMINAL AND 
ADJECTIVAL  MORPHOLOGY
The unmarked number for nouns and adjectives is singular,7 and the unmarked 
gender masculine. Nouns are inﬂ ected for number (dual and plural) and, in certain 
lexemes, for gender (feminine). The nominal level-two morphemes are laid out in 
Table 7.2 and, as in Table 7.1, are numbered according to the order in which they 
are aﬃ  xed to the stem.
In Cairene, a demonstrative or a prepositional phrase with a pronominal suﬃ  x 
may be cliticized to a preceding vowel-ﬁ nal noun in certain phrases and, in such 
cases, induce pre-suﬃ  x lengthening (cf. (13) in Section 8.1.1), as in: bi-nisba 
‘in relation’ versus bi-nisbƒli ‘in relation to me’ and il-ƒla ‘the situation’ versus 
il-alƒdi ‘this situation’ (Broselow 1976: 73).
7.2.1 Afﬁ xation of level-two nominal morphemes
In general, the nominal morphemes aﬃ  x in the order given in Table 7.2 (however, 
cf. Section 7.2.3). Nominal morphemes in the level-two morphology aﬃ  x min-
imally to the minimal phonological word, as is the case with verbal morphemes. 
The constraint on pre-suﬃ  xal short vowels is not restricted to the verbal morph-
ology in Cairene, but also applies whenever suﬃ  xation takes place to a nominal 
morpheme ending in a short vowel. Consonant-initial possessive pronoun suﬃ  xes 
induce epenthesis when aﬃ  xed to stems ending in VCC in both dialects. When 
a consonant-initial possessive suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to a stem ending in VVC, the long 
vowel of the stem is subject to CSS in Cairene, as in: /d¤n + ha/ > dinha ‘her reli-
gion’ and /mƒl + kum/ > malkum ‘your pl. property’. In San’ani, the long vowel 
or diphthong of a stem ending in VVC or ayC or awC is maintained and suﬃ  xa-
tion takes place either with or without epenthesis, as in: /mƒl + hum/ > mƒlhum 
~ mƒluhum ‘their m. land’, /zawj + hƒ/ > zawjhƒ ~ zawjahƒ ‘her husband’, and 
/dayn + hin/ > daynhin ~ daynahin ‘their f. debt’ (see Sections 4.4.1.3 and 7.1.2). 
Consider the example in (22) of the aﬃ  xation of nominal level-two morphemes in 
Cairene.8
7 Collectives/singulatives are an exception to this: for a number of nouns, a singulative is formed 
by adding a suﬃ  x -a or -ƒya in Cairene, -ih or -¤ in San’ani, to a collective (see Sections 7.3.2, 7.2.4), 
for example, mawz-¤ coll. mawz ‘banana’ (SA), tuffƒ-a coll. tuffƒ ‘apple’ (CA), ﬁ gl-a ~ ﬁ gl-ƒya coll. 
ﬁ gl ‘radish’ (CA). When the collective is a verbal noun, the singulative or instance noun is formed 
exclusively by suﬃ  xation of -a in Cairene, -ih in San’ani.
8 When a vowel-initial suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to a noun or adjective ending in -i in Cairene, /i/ is subject to 
pre-suﬃ  x lengthening (see Section 8.1.1) and y-strengthening (see Section 8.1.2, Broselow 1976: 114). 
In San’ani, glide formation takes place before the vowel-initial suﬃ  x.

7.2.2 Allomorphy
In both dialects, allomorphy is exhibited in the {feminine singular} nominal mor-
pheme and in the {ﬁ rst person singular} possessive pronoun.
7.2.2.1 Allomorphy: {feminine singular}
The ending -a in Cairene, -ih in San’ani, which predominantly denotes {feminine 
singular} in nouns and adjectives (cf. n. 1) and as such is also used to derive nouns 
from relational adjectives (cf. (22) and (24)), has two allomorphs: /it/ (CA) and /at/ 
(SA) in the construct state and /a/ (CA) and /ih/ (SA) elsewhere. The second term 
in the genitive construct may be either a possessive pronoun suﬃ  x or a noun. The 
allomorphy characteristic of Arabic dialects today goes back to Classical Arabic 
where the morpheme was realized as [at] plus case ending in all but pre-pausal pos-
ition. In pre-pausal position, it was realized as [ah] with no case ending. This posi-
tional allomorphy is denoted in the Arabic script by a complex symbol: the sign 
for /h/ together with the two superscript dots characteristic of /t/ (ö). The original-

189
ly non-pausal *t allomorph is now restricted in almost all dialects of Arabic to the 
construct state.9 Consider the following examples from San’ani and Cairene.
(25) (a) San’ani marih 
‘woman’
 
 
 
marat aš-šayx 
‘the Shaykh’s wife’
 
 
 
maratih 
‘his wife’
 
(b) Cairene mudarrisa 
‘teacher f.’
 
 
 
mudarrisit muna ‘Muna’s teacher f.’
 
 
 
mudarrisitha 
‘her teacher f.’
The construct allomorph is also used before the dual ending, as in San’ani yaw-
matayn ‘two days’ and Cairene šanit¢n ‘two bags’.10
In Cairene, when a noun with the {feminine singular} suﬃ  x takes a following 
vowel-initial possessive pronoun suﬃ  x or the dual ending -¢n and is preceded by a 
monomoraic syllable, /i/ of the construct allomorph is subject to syncope (see Sec-
tion 4.4.2).
7.2.2.2 Allomorphy: {ﬁ rst person singular}
The {second person singular} and {third person masculine singular} possessive 
pronoun suﬃ  xes are vowel-initial unless aﬃ  xed to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem (see 
Table 7.2). This is similar to the allomorphy described above for the verbal object 
pronoun suﬃ  xes. Thus, ‘your m.s. books’ in Cairene and San’ani is kutubak with 
the possessive pronoun suﬃ  x realized as /ak/, while ‘your m.s. father’ is ab¶k with 
the possessive suﬃ  x realized as /k/. The San’ani {second person feminine singu-
lar} possessive suﬃ  x is realized as /iš/ post-consonantally, as in kutubiš ‘your f.s. 
books’, but as /š/ post-vocalically, to give ab¶š ‘your f.s. father’ and gafƒš ‘behind 
 9 In northern Yemeni dialects spoken between Sa‘dah and Razih, the /t/ allomorph is used in all 
deﬁ nite nouns. The dialect of Farwah has forms such as an-ﬁ rsat ‘the axe’, and the dialect of al-Gal‘ah 
forms such as ag-gamat ‘the old man’ (Behnstedt 1987: 54–5).
10 For Cairene, Broselow claims that the dual is, at least historically, a construct phrase of noun 
plus the numeral itn¢n ‘two’, and argues that this explains the realization of -t- before the dual suﬃ  x 
(Broselow 1976).

realized as /ik/ in post-consonantal position, but as /ki/ post-vocalically, as for 
the object suﬃ  x (see Section 7.1.3.2), to give bintik ‘your f.s. daughter’ but ax¶ki 
‘your f.s. brother’.
A rather more interesting type of allomorphy is exhibited by the {ﬁ rst person sin-
gular} possessive pronoun suﬃ  x. This morpheme has two allomorphs in Cairene 
and three allomorphs in San’ani. In both dialects, the morpheme is realized as a 
vowel when suﬃ  xed to a consonant-ﬁ nal stem.

stem, and the pre-suﬃ  xal vowel is subject to lengthening.

macƒya

‘to me’11
In San’ani, the /ya/ allomorph is attested when the morpheme is suﬃ  xed to a stem 
ending in -ƒ, but not when the stem ends in the -i of sub-minimal prepositions. In 
this latter case, the vowel of the stem is deleted and the /¤/ allomorph is used. Thus, 
while gafƒ + {ﬁ rst person singular} is realized as gafƒya ‘behind me’ and warƒ + 
{ﬁ rst person singular} as warƒya ‘behind me’, li + {ﬁ rst person singular} as l¤ ‘to 
me’ and bi + {ﬁ rst person singular} as b¤ ‘with me’. The {ﬁ rst person singular} pos-
sessive suﬃ  x in San’ani has an additional lexicalized allomorph /n¤/, presumably 
formed on analogy with the {ﬁ rst person singular} object suﬃ  x (see Table 7.1), 
which is only suﬃ  xed to the preposition f¤ ‘in’ to give f¤n¤ ‘in me’.
7.2.3 The -i morpheme in Cairene
The derivational morpheme -i in Cairene (-¤ in San’ani) is typically suﬃ  xed to 
nouns to produce a relational adjective, as in mari/¤ ‘Egyptian’ from mar ‘Egypt’ 
and arbi/¤ ‘west(ward)’ from arb ‘west’. In Cairene, the morpheme is also regu-
larly suﬃ  xed to plural inanimate nouns to denote a professional or habitual noun 
(relating to humans) or a habitual adjective.12 In this dialect, the -i suﬃ  x is a 
11 Negated, the form is realized as ma l¤š.
12 San’ani has a few nouns and adjectives of the type plural + -¤, as in banƒt¤ ‘girl’s’, rijƒl¤ ‘men’s’, 
ciyyƒl¤ ‘children’s’.

7.2 level-two nominal and adjectival morphology
191
very productive means of forming professional or habitual nouns where either the 
faccƒl pattern commonly associated with professional nouns (as in gazzƒr ‘butch-
er’, faƒn ‘baker’) does not already exist, or where it cannot be formed. In a 
number of cases, a plural + i noun or adjective has a faccƒl synonym. Badawi and 
Hinds (1986) list over 140 instances of plural + i nouns or adjectives for Egyptian 
Arabic, the majority of which are attested in Cairene.13 Whether the plural form 
to which the ending is aﬃ  xed is a broken plural or sound feminine plural (that is, 
with the suﬃ  x ƒt) depends on the type of plural taken by the singular noun. Where 
the suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to broken plurals, level-two morphology (the suﬃ  x) clearly fol-
lows level-one morphology (the derived broken plural). Where the suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed 
to a sound feminine plural, however, the ordering of level-two morphemes is reana-
lysed exceptionally, since the -i ending (ordered 1 in Table 7.2) now follows the 
{feminine plural} suﬃ  x (ordered 4 in Table 7.2). Consider the following examples 
of broken plural + -i.
(29) ʔugari 
‘day labourer’ 
from ʔugra pl. ʔugar

pay’

from bib¢h pl. bibehƒt ‘baby’
Plural + -i nouns and adjectives are most commonly formed from the verbal par-
ticiples of derived verbs, the vast majority of which are derived from form II verbs. 
In these cases, the plural is invariably formed by the {feminine plural} suﬃ  x.

13 Two of the examples recorded are adverbs. These are yomƒti ‘daily’ and lelƒti ‘nightly, every 
night’.
14 M. Woidich considers these examples to involve a single suﬃ  x -ƒti (M. Woidich, p.c.). However, 
the existence of a large number of nouns formed from a broken plural plus -i suﬃ  x suggests that -ƒt + 
-i is a more morphologically economical analysis.
15 This has a synonym formed on the faccƒl pattern, bakkƒš ‘bluﬀ er’.

In a very few cases, the plural portion of plural + -i nouns/adjectives is formed 
with the sound feminine plural even though the singular noun pluralizes by means 
of the broken plural. It may be that these examples, and the one in (33), can be 
analysed as involving a single suﬃ  x -ƒti (as suggested by M. Woidich, p.c.) on 
analogy with the {feminine plural} + -i formations given in (31).

7.2.4 A homophonous morpheme in San’ani
The suﬃ  xation of -i in the formation of professional or habitual nouns in Cairene 
has a clear link with the relational sense of the morpheme. Indeed, relational adjec-
tives may function syntactically as nouns in the appropriate context. San’ani, how-
ever, has a morpheme which is homophonous with the relational morpheme, but 
which has a singulative and/or diminutive sense. The ending -¤ is a feature of many 
singular nouns, several of which encompass the sense of smallness or refer to 
small entities.

The diminutive in San’ani, attested in a few lexicalized items, is often marked by 
the suﬃ  xation of -¤ in addition to templatic change.

7.3 ADDITIONAL SUFFIXAL
MORPHEMES IN CAIRENE
Cairene has a number of additional suﬃ  xal morphemes, some of which are due to 
Turkish inﬂ uence and some of which are native. The suﬃ  xes due to Turkish inﬂ u-
ence are derivational and include -gi, -li, -lik, and -xƒna. Of these, -xƒna is origin-
ally Persian and came into Cairene via Turkish. Native suﬃ  xes include -ƒni, -ƒwi, 
-awi, and -ƒya. I ﬁ rst consider suﬃ  xes due to Turkish inﬂ uence.
7.3.1 Turkish sufﬁ xes
The most common Turkish suﬃ  x in Cairene is -gi, which is used predominantly 
to produce a noun of profession or habitude. The plural of -gi nouns is formed by 
suﬃ  xation of the otherwise {feminine singular} morpheme (cf. n. 1) -a to give 
(via y-strengthening, see Section 8.1.2) -giyya. Between them, Badawi and Hinds 
(1986) and Prokosch (1983) record around 130 -gi nouns for Cairene, the vast 
majority of which are still part of the language. The suﬃ  x can be aﬃ  xed to a verbal 
noun, a noun of place or instrument, a singular noun, a collective noun, a plural 
noun, or a verb. -gi is often suﬃ  xed to a singular loan word. In terms of the order of 
morphemes, -gi follows the output of level-one morphology (deverbal nouns, bro-
ken plurals); -gi suﬃ  xation applies to the word stem, overlooking the {feminine} 
morpheme -a, as exempliﬁ ed in words such as ʔidargi ‘good administrator’ from 
ʔidƒra ‘administration’, and tazkargi ‘ticket seller’ from tazkara ‘ticket’. In words 
such as tufagi ‘dealer in art’ from tufa ‘object of worth’ and buagi ‘postman’ 
from bua ‘post’, I analyse the pre-suﬃ  xal vowel as historically epenthetic as it is 
in words such as nawagi ‘given to speaking in elevated language’ (from naw + 
gi). The fact that the epenthetic vowel is not [i], as it is in the rest of the phonology, 
but [a], suggests that -gi words were initially produced at a stage in the history of 
the language when the epenthetic vowel was realized as [a]. Today the morpheme 
has two allomorphs: /agi/ following CC- and /gi/ elsewhere.16 Consider the follow-
ing examples.
16 M. Woidich sees -a- in -agi not as epenthetic but as the result of Turkish words taken wholesale 
into Cairene and only later the two allomorphs -gi and -agi being incorporated into Cairene grammar 
(M. Woidich p.c.).
and šahƒb, for example, are ašwƒg¤, ixlƒ¤, ¤nƒs¤, and ša ƒb¤.

7.3 additional suffixal morphemes in cairene
195
(42) -gi + passive participle (very rare)
 
macgungi [obs.] ‘pharmacist’ from macg¶n ‘paste, electuary’
The suﬃ  xes -lik and -xƒna are aﬃ  xed to singular nouns to denote the place in 
which something is kept or made. Of the two suﬃ  xes, -xƒna is the more common. 
Nouns ending in -xƒna are pluralized by the {feminine plural} suﬃ  x -ƒt. Where 
the pre-suﬃ  xed noun ends in -CC, as in sarg ‘saddle’, syllable structure was pre-
served historically by epenthesis of -a-, as in the case of -gi nouns considered 
above.17 Today the morpheme has two allomorphs: /axƒna/ following a -CC base 
and /xƒna/ elsewhere. Consider the following examples of noun + -xƒna. I do not 
include nouns which have been borrowed in their entirety from Turkish.
(43) ʔadabxƒna 
‘lavatory’
 
axamxƒna ‘chief rabbi’s residence and administrative centre’
 
daftarxƒna ‘archive’
 
sargaxƒna 
‘tackroom’
 
salaxƒna 
‘slaughterhouse’ (from salx ‘skinning’)
 
šafaxƒna

and one in Prokosch (1983).
(44) 
silalik 
‘armoury’
 
salamlik 
‘basement’
 
aramlik ‘women’s quarters’
The suﬃ  x -li is restricted in occurrence. It is generally suﬃ  xed to place names 
to give an adjective with the sense ‘pertaining from’. Badawi and Hinds (1986) 
also have a few examples of -li nouns or adjectives describing habitual character-
istics or profession. Nouns ending in -li are pluralized by suﬃ  xation of -a via 
y-strengthening (see Section 8.1.2), as for -gi. Consider the examples in (45).
(45) ʔazmirli 
‘pertaining to Izmir’
 
budadli

badƒd ‘Baghdad’)
 
šarbatli 
‘vendor of sweet drinks’ (from šarbƒt ‘fruit syrup’)
 
wagbatli 
‘ socially alert, never missing a chance to be courteous’ (from 
/wƒgib + ƒt/ ‘obligations’)
7.3.2 Additional native sufﬁ xes
The additional native suﬃ  xes in Cairene considered here are the adjectival suﬃ  xes 
-ƒni, -ƒwi, -awi and the singulative suﬃ  x -ƒya.
17 M. Woidich analyses -a- in words such as sargaxƒna as the result of a preferred vowel melody to 
which foreign nouns are modelled (M. Woidich p.c.).

morphology
196
The suﬃ  x -ƒni is often aﬃ  xed to nouns ending in a vowel or in -iyya to produce 
an adjective. Suﬃ  xation of -ƒni to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem induces deletion of the stem-
ﬁ nal vowel, as in anƒni ‘selﬁ sh’ from ana ‘I’ and barrƒni ‘outer’ from barra ‘out-
side’ (cf. Section 9.1.2.1). Suﬃ  xation applies directly to the stem and overlooks 
any suﬃ  xes in the noun. This is exempliﬁ ed in ʔiskandarƒni ‘Alexandrian’ from 
ʔiskandariyya ‘Alexandria’. The suﬃ  x -ƒni derives a large number of adjectives 
from foreign place names, as in ʔamrikƒni ‘American’ from ʔamr¤ka ‘America’ 
and alyƒni ‘Italian’ from ʔialya ‘Italy’. It also derives adjectives from adverbs, 
as in barrƒni ‘outer’ from barra ‘outside’, tatƒni ‘lower, under’ from tat ‘under-
neath, below’, foʔƒni ‘upper’ from f¥ʔ ‘up, upstairs’, warrƒni ‘rear, back’ from 
wara ‘behind’, and guwwƒni ‘inner’ from guwwa ‘inside’. In addition, -ƒni 
is used to derive adjectives which have a more speciﬁ c or slightly diﬀ erent 
meaning from cognate adjectives. In this case, suﬃ  xation is to a consonant-ﬁ nal 
stem. Examples include abyaƒni ‘fair-complexioned (males only)’ versus abya 
‘white’, asmarƒni ‘dark-skinned, of dark complexion’ versus asmar ‘dark-skinned’, 
ašʔarƒni ‘blondish’ versus ašʔar ‘blond’, amarƒni ‘reddish’ versus amar ‘red’, 
ƒxir ‘end, latter part’.
The suﬃ  x -ƒwi is also commonly aﬃ  xed to nouns ending in a vowel or in -iyya. 
It is often used to provide an adjective with the sense of pertaining to a place. As for 
-ƒni, suﬃ  xation applies to the word stem overlooking any suﬃ  xes, and suﬃ  xation 
to a vowel-ﬁ nal stem induces deletion of the stem vowel. Consider the following 
words:

basƒwi 
‘pertaining to Tell Basta’
 
anƒwi

azzƒwi

In a few cases, an adjective ending in -ƒwi may be a (usually derogatory) near 
synonym of an adjective with the relational suﬃ  x -i.

The suﬃ  x -awi is used regularly to derive adjectives from sub-minimal stems. The 
sub-minimal stems are usually augmented in their non-suﬃ  xed forms through 
gemination of the ﬁ nal radical. Consider the following examples:
(49) 
damawi 
‘bloody’ (from dam(m) ‘blood’)
 
axawi 
‘fraternal’ (from ax(x) ‘brother’)
 
abawi 
‘paternal’ (from ab(b) ‘father’)
 
yadawi 
‘by hand, hand adj.’ (from yad(d) ~ yad ‘hand’)
 
sanawi 
‘annual’ (from sana ‘year’)
These forms can be analysed as the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis requiring 
a monomoraic extension prior to suﬃ  xation in order to provide the required pre-
suﬃ  xal bimoraic base (cf. Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1). I therefore assume that the 
suﬃ  x comprises two elements—/a(w)/ and /i/. The initial portion is suﬃ  xed to the 
sub-minimal stem to provide a minimal bimoraic base for the adjectival suﬃ  x. The 
default consonant /w/ (see Section 6.6) then provides an onset for the adjectival 
suﬃ  x -i.
The unmarked number for nouns is singular, with the exception of collectives 
whose singulative or unit noun is derived by means of a suﬃ  x. In San’ani, the sin-
gulative suﬃ  x for concrete nouns is -¤ for some nouns (see Section 7.2.4) and the 
{feminine singular} -ih for others. In Cairene, the suﬃ  x is usually the {feminine 
singular} -a, although a number of nouns have the singulative -ƒya. Nouns ending 
in -ƒya are pluralized by the {feminine plural} suﬃ  x. The -ƒya singulative is either 
synonymous with the -a singulative (51a), or it has a diminutive or slightly diﬀ er-
ent sense to the -a singulative (51b). In some cases, -ƒya forms the singulative to 
the exclusion of -a.

7.3.3 Additional sufﬁ xal morphemes in San’ani
San’ani has fewer additional suﬃ  xal morphemes than Cairene, in particular those 
due to foreign inﬂ uence. This is largely due to the fact that the Turks had consider-
ably less inﬂ uence in Yemen than in Egypt. Although foreign morphemes have 
been adapted to the San’ani phonological system, they are rarely productive and 
are found predominantly in frozen forms or borrowings. Words involving -j¤ are 
mainly related to military or defence activity, and include the following (obsolete 
words marked [obs.]):
(53) 
tfakj¤ 
‘gunsmith’ (from Turkish tüfekci)
 
ubš¤ 
‘artillery man’ (from Turkish topçu)
 
n¶batš¤ 
‘sentry, watchman’ (from Turkish nöbetçi)
 
¥daj¤ [obs.] 
‘valet, servant’ (from Turkish odacı)
 
ajzaj¤ [obs.] 
‘pharmacist’ (from /ajzƒ + j¤/)
 
mafraj¤ 
‘idler’ (from /mafra + j¤/)
The last two examples aﬃ  x the Turkish suﬃ  x to an Arabic word, and the remainder 
are probably direct loans from Turkish. While -gi has become part of the morph-
ology in Cairene, -j¤ was never fully adopted in San’ani, and words containing -j¤ 
have largely dropped out of the language. The majority of words with the Turkish 
suﬃ  x -j¤ listed in Rossi’s glossary of 1939 are no longer in use. Nouns ending in 
-j¤ are pluralized by suﬃ  xation of the otherwise {feminine singular} morpheme -ih 
with pre-suﬃ  xal glide formation.
Other foreign suﬃ  xes are less common than -j¤. One obsolete example of a word 
containing the suﬃ  x -xƒnih (= Cairene -xƒna) in Rossi’s glossary is xastaxƒnih 
or astaxƒnih ‘hospital’ (from Turkish hastahane). The suﬃ  x -lak is found in one 
word which is rarely used in the language today, salƒmlak ‘reception room’. The 
suﬃ  x -l¤ is found in one word which is now obsolete, tacahhudl¤ ‘registered let-
ter’.
7.3.4 Additional native sufﬁ xes
The principal additional native suﬃ  xes in San’ani are the mainly adjectival suﬃ  x-

7.4 conclusion
199
es -ƒni, -ƒwi, and -aw¤. The singulative suﬃ  x -ƒyih (= Cairene -ƒya) is not attested 
in this dialect.
As in Cairene, -ƒni is generally suﬃ  xed to nouns ending in a vowel or the fem-
inine suﬃ  x -ih to produce an adjective. On suﬃ  xation, the stem-ﬁ nal vowel is 
deleted and any feminine suﬃ  x is overlooked, as in ancƒn¤ ‘San’ani’ from ancƒ 
and bay	ƒn¤ ‘from al-Bayda’ from al-bay	uh. In a few cases, nouns are formed 
from a noun plus the -ƒn¤ ending; however, in the words concerned it may be that a 
noun-like sense has been imposed by the translator. These include suxaymƒn¤ ‘fog, 
mist’ from suxƒm ‘soot’ and cumƒyƒn¤ ‘fog’ from cumƒ ‘mist’ (from the root /c-m-y/ 
indicating blindness).
The suﬃ  x -ƒwi, which is common in Cairene, is partially taken over in San’ani 
by the relational suﬃ  x -¤ and does not have the alternative derogatory sense dis-
cussed for Cairene above. Thus, while in Cairene faransa is adjectivized by -ƒwi 
(faransƒwi), in San’ani faransƒ may be adjectivized by either -ƒw¤ or -¤, to give 
faransƒw¤ ~ farans¤ ‘French’ (Watson 1996: 30). Of these, -¤ is considered to be 
more typically San’ani than -ƒw¤. As in Cairene, -aw¤ is suﬃ  xed to sub-minimal 
stems to produce an adjective, as in abaw¤ ‘paternal’ from ab ‘father’, samaw¤ ‘sky-
blue’ from samƒ ‘sky’, and damaw¤ ‘blood-thirsty’ from dam ‘blood’.
7.4 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I discussed level-two morphology in Cairene and San’ani. In con-
trast to level-one morphology, level-two morphology is entirely concatenative, and 
level-two processes invariably follow level-one processes. The level-two morph-
ology is considered in terms of verbal and nominal morphology. Most level-two 
processes apply in a ﬁ xed order as given in the tables at the beginning of the rele-
vant sections. In the level-two nominal morphology, however, we see that the suﬃ  x 
-i, normally used to derive relational adjectives from nouns, may be suﬃ  xed to bro-
ken or sound feminine plurals in Cairene to denote a professional or habitual noun. 
Where it is suﬃ  xed to a sound feminine plural, as in sacƒti ‘watchmaker/repairer’ 
(from sacƒt ‘watches’), the ordering of level-two morphemes is reinterpreted, since 
the -i suﬃ  x, ranked as 1 in Table 7.2, now follows the feminine plural suﬃ  x, -ƒt 
which is ranked in Table 7.2 as 4. At the end of the chapter, I consider foreign and 
additional suﬃ  xes in the two dialects, and suggest that the metropolitan social his-
tory of Cairene is reﬂ ected in the elements, and in the semantics, of its richer nom-
inal suﬃ  xal morphology.

LEXICAL PHONOLOGY
This chapter and the ﬁ nal two chapters of the book deal with general phonologic-
al processes. Phonological processes fall into two broad classes: those which are 
sensitive to lexical information and morphological structure, and those which do 
not exhibit such sensitivity. Processes which are insensitive to morphological struc-
ture take place after the elimination of all morphological cues. In a language such 
as English, with a mainly concatenative morphology, morphemic distinctions are 
encoded by means of labelled brackets which are removed at the end of each lex-
ical cycle through Bracket Erasure:
(1) 
The Bracket Erasure Convention
 
Internal brackets are erased at the end of a level.1
 
(Kiparsky 1982: 140; Archangeli 1984b: 4; Kaisse and Shaw 1985: 9)
As seen in Chapter 6, in a mainly non-concatenative morphological system such 
as Arabic, morphemic distinctions are encoded both phonologically, through tier 
segregation, and morphologically, through the marking of morpheme nodes (µ). 
Towards the end of the derivation, morphemic tiers are folded together into a single 
linearized tier by a process known as Tier Conﬂ ation (see Section 6.3).
It has been assumed that with each application of TC, the relevant morphologic-
al information is erased, and that the eﬀ ect of TC is similar to that of Bracket Eras-
ure in languages which exhibit concatenative morphological systems (McCarthy 
1986: 228). A morphologically conditioned rule of Metathesis in Modern Hebrew, 
however, demonstrates that TC does not necessarily erase all morphological infor-
mation (Bat-El 1988): while some phonological processes apply prior to TC, oth-
ers appear to apply after TC but still require access to morphological information. 
Two such processes in Arabic are the anticipatory assimilation of the -l of the 
deﬁ nite article to a coronal (optionally also to a velar plosive in Cairene) and the 
assimilation of t- of the detransitivizing preﬁ x to (a subset of) the coronals (and 
optionally a velar plosive in Cairene). Therefore the erasure of morpheme nodes, 
which eliminates the morphological cue to morphemic distinction, is equivalent 
to the Bracket Erasure Convention and not TC. Phonological processes which 
require access to morphological information apply either before or after TC but 
before the erasure of morpheme nodes. Where a phonological process does not 
1 Borowsky (1986) has claimed that Bracket Erasure applies at the end of the lexical levels, rather 
than at the end of each level. This, however, does not aﬀ ect the argument which follows here, since TC 
occurs within the lexicon but does not erase all morphological information.

8.1  prosodic processes

require access to morphological information, the process occurs after complete 
TC has taken place and morpheme nodes have been erased. Once morphological 
information has been erased, phonological processes may occur within speciﬁ c 
prosodic units: the syllable, the foot, the phonological word, the phonological 
phrase, or the phonological utterance (cf. Nespor and Vogel 1986).
Processes which apply prior to the erasure of morphological information are 
equivalent to the rules of Lexical Phonology which apply within the lexicon: they 
have some link with the morphology; they may have lexical exceptions; they 
are structure preserving insofar as they do not introduce or refer to contrastive 
segments; and they only apply within words (McMahon 1994: 66). Processes 
which lack lexical exceptions, which are not subject to morphological condition-
ing, which introduce or refer to non-contrastive segments, which are exception-
less, and which apply across words as well as within them apply post-lexically 
(cf. Kaisse and Shaw 1985: 4–5; McMahon 1994: 66). In contrast to lexical proc-
esses, post-lexical processes often result in gradient rather than binary outputs: in 
the spread of pharyngealization (see Sections 10.3 and 10.4), emphasis decreases 
towards the end of the domain and may result in a segment which is pharyngeal-
ized at the edge close to the trigger, but non-pharyngealized at the edge away from 
the trigger. Post-lexical processes may also create novel sequences that are disal-
lowed in the lexicon: in Chapter 4, we saw that the San’ani fast speech phenom-
enon deleting unstressed vowels in initial syllables produces unusual clusters of 
consonants, as in ﬂ ih ‘party’ < aﬂ ih (see Section 4.4.2.3). The lexical process 
of degemination and syncope in form II verbs in the same dialect, by contrast, 
results in sequences which are permitted in the lexicon, as in: yilabs¶ ‘they m. 
dress (someone)’ < yilabbis¶ (see Section 4.4.2.2). Finally, speakers judge the out-
puts of lexical processes to be diﬀ erent from the inputs, but the output of postlex-
ical processes to be the same as the inputs: for example, speakers typically judge 
all allophones of voiceless stops to be the same.
In this chapter I consider phonological processes which require access to mor-
phological information. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with post-lexical phonological 
processes. In discussing phonological processes, I consider processes which aﬀ ect 
the prosody and then processes which aﬀ ect the melody.
8.1 PROSODIC PROCESSES
8.1.1 Pre-sufﬁ x vowel lengthening (in CA)
Suﬃ  xes do not aﬃ  x directly to a morpheme with a ﬁ nal short vowel. Where a mor-
pheme ends in a vowel in San’ani, the vowel is invariably long and hence bimoraic. 
In Cairene, however, there are a number of short-vowel-ﬁ nal morphemes. When 
a suﬃ  x is concatenated to a morpheme ending in a short vowel, the vowel of this 
morpheme is lengthened (see Section 7.1.2). Examples of pre-suﬃ  x vowel length-
ening in Cairene are in (2).

When a noun or adjective taking the {feminine singular} suﬃ  x -a is followed by a 
prepositional phrase with a pronoun suﬃ  x, the prepositional phrase is cliticized to 
the a-ﬁ nal word and pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening occurs:

/mawc¶da + bak/ 
mawcudƒbak 
‘promised f.s. to you m.s.’
 
/bi-nisba + li/ 
bi-nisbƒli 
‘in relation to me’
Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening takes place when the demonstrative pronoun da or di 
is cliticized to a vowel-ﬁ nal preposition or to a noun ending in -a, as in (4).
(4) 
/is-sana + di/ 
is-sanƒdi 
‘this year’
 
/cala + da/ 
calƒda 
‘on that m.’
Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening occurs even when the suﬃ  x is not realized phonet-
ically, as in the post-vocalic allomorph of the {third person masculine singular} 
object suﬃ  x:
(5) 
/šƒfu + (h)/ 
šaf¶(h) 
‘they saw him’
 
/maska + (h)/ 
maskƒ(h) 
‘holding f.s. him’
Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening can be seen as resulting from a constraint on the 
weight of pre-suﬃ  xal bases. This is formalized as a negative constraint on mor-
phemes ending in a monomoraic vowel pre-suﬃ  xally:
When a morpheme ending in a short vowel occurs in pre-suﬃ  xal position, viola-
tions of constraint (6) are repaired by lengthening of the pre-suﬃ  x vowel. Pre-
suﬃ  x vowel lengthening is formalized as mora reduplication, repeated in (7) from 
Section 7.1.2.

8.1  prosodic processes
203
Pre-suﬃ  x lengthening is a cyclic rule. That is to say, it is a rule in which the 
derivation proceeds in stages through the repeated application of the same set 
of ordered rules to successively larger, more inclusive strings (Kenstowicz 1994: 
203–4). Cyclic rules are subject to the Strict Cycle Condition in (8) (after Kensto-
wicz 1994: 208, adapted from Mascaró 1976 and Halle 1978), which restricts their 
application to derived environments only.
(8) 
Strict Cycle Condition
 
 A cyclic rule may apply to a string x just in case either of the following 
holds:
 
(a)  The rule makes crucial reference to information in the representation 
that spans the boundary between the current cycle and the preceding 
one.
 
(b)  The rule applies solely within the domain of the previous cycle but cru-
cially refers to information supplied by a rule operating on the current 
cycle.
Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening feeds a further rule of unstressed long vowel reduc-
tion (see Section 9.1.1). Consider the derivation of ma-šafuh¶š ‘they didn’t see 
him’ (square brackets delineate morphemes).

In (9), the vowel subject to lengthening falls within the domain of the previous 
cycle, but pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening refers crucially to information added by 
the current cycle—namely, the suﬃ  x. Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening therefore con-
forms to (a) and (b) of the Strict Cycle Condition.
8.1.2 y-strengthening (in CA)
Pre-suﬃ  x lengthening in Cairene is most apparent when the suﬃ  x or clitic is con-
sonant initial, as in the cases given in (2) and (3) above. Pre-suﬃ  x lengthening is 
not restricted to pre-consonantal position, however, and also occurs on concatena-
tion of a vowel-initial suﬃ  x to a vowel-ﬁ nal morpheme (ending in -i).2 In this case, 
2 The nominal {feminine singular} suﬃ  x -a constitutes an exception to this when it takes a pro-
nominal suﬃ  x. Here, the constraint on short pre-suﬃ  xal vowels is met through allomorphy, with the 
morpheme taking the construct allomorph /it/ (see Section 7.2.2.1).

lexical phonology
204
pre-suﬃ  x lengthening is followed by glide formation and y-strengthening (cf. Bro-
selow 1976: 114–16). When an adjective or noun with the relational ending -i3 or 
the ending -gi or -li (see Section 7.3.1) takes a vowel-initial suﬃ  x, -i is subject to 
pre-suﬃ  x lengthening through mora reduplication, as in (12a). (In this and the fol-
lowing diagrams, where both moras and morphemes are represented, µ above the 
segmental tier represents a mora, and µ below the segmental tier a morpheme.)
After the conﬂ ation of morphemic tiers, mora reduplication leaves the vowel of 
the suﬃ  x without the required onset. In response to the requirements of syllable 
well-formedness, glide formation takes place through association of the leftmost 
vocalic matrix with the adjacent syllable node, and the glide becomes the onset of 
the rightmost syllable (cf. Sections 8.1.4 and 9.1.2.2).
The processes of pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening and glide formation are apparently 
no diﬀ erent here from other cases of pre-suﬃ  x lengthening discussed above and 
glide formation discussed in Section 9.1.2.2. However, in contrast to other long 
vowels which result from pre-suﬃ  x lengthening, the resulting bimoraic vowel is 
resistant to unstressed long vowel shortening. This is exempliﬁ ed in (11), in which 
¤ does not fall in the rightmost heavy syllable.

raic [dorsal] vowel is subject to unstressed vowel shortening.

The lack of shortening of ¤ when an adjective or noun ending in -i is concatenated

unstressed /iy/ which results from /iyi/ through syncope. This is exempliﬁ ed 
in (13).

Scholars of Cairene Arabic generally distinguish high vowels which fail to undergo 
shortening from those which do by representing the former as vowel + glide and 
the latter as long vowels. Broselow (1976: 113) says that the sequence /i:y/ never 
occurs, but rather is always realized as [iyy].4 Thus, yaman¤yƒt ‘Yemenis f.’ is repre-
sented as yamaniyyƒt, while length in the long vowel in f¤l ‘elephant’ is represented 
by a macron. This is a practice I follow in this work. The result of pre-suﬃ  x length-
ening and glide formation is analysed not as a long vowel + glide sequence, but as 
a short vowel plus geminate /yy/. In order to capture this fact, I term the combined 
pre-suﬃ  x lengthening and glide formation process ‘y-strengthening’.5
8.1.3 n-strengthening
The gemination of /n/ in sub-minimal words is arguably another instance of pre-
suﬃ  x mora reduplication (cf. Section 5.2.3). In both Cairene and San’ani, ﬁ nal 
/n/ in a monomoraic function word is geminated before a pronoun suﬃ  x. Gemina-
tion of ﬁ nal sonorants in monomoraic function words is a feature of several other 
modern dialects of Arabic, and also of Standard Arabic before a vowel-initial suf-
ﬁ x. Examples from Cairene and San’ani include the following.
(14) 
/min + hƒ/ 
minnahƒ 
‘from her’ (SA)
 
/min + ha/ 
minnaha 
‘from her’ (CA)
 
/min + ih/ 
minnih

/min + u/ 
minnu 
‘from him’ (CA)
 
/can + iš/ 
canniš 
‘about you f.s.’ (SA)
 
/can + ik/ 
cannik 
‘about you f.s.’ CA
Gemination of /n/ in monomoraic function words is the result of a constraint 
on monomoraic stems in the dialects (see Section 6.4.2), and the requirement 
4 Likewise, the sequence /u:w/ is never realized as such, but rather as [uww]: huwwa ‘he’ is negated 
as ma huwwƒš ‘he is not’.
5 Morphemes ending in -¤ in San’ani are subject to glide formation when concatenated with a 
vowel-initial morpheme, but not subject to pre-suﬃ  x lengthening since the pre-suﬃ  xal vowel is already 
bi moraic.

lexical phonology
206
that  level-two morphemes are aﬃ  xed to a form at least the size of the minimal 
phonological word (see Section 7.1). Before a suﬃ  x, pre-suﬃ  x mora reduplication 
applies to produce a minimal stem, and /n/ of the function word associates both 
with the new mora and with the onset of the following syllable. This is exempliﬁ ed 
in (15) in the derivation of San’ani minnih ‘from him’.
Following TC, gemination of /n/ produces the output minnih ‘from him’. In fast, 
casual speech, gemination of /n/ may fail to apply before consonant-initial suﬃ  xes. 
Thus, the following alternative pronunciations may be heard:
(16) 
minhƒ ~ minnahƒ ‘from her’ (SA)
 
minnƒ ~ minnanƒ ‘from us’ (SA)
 
minha ~ minnaha ‘from her’ (CA)
 
minna ~ minnina ‘from us’ (CA)
The optional failure of n-gemination before a consonant-initial suﬃ  x is due to the 
fact that pre-consonantally, /n/ maintains the mora gained through mora reduplica-
tion, allowing the stem to fulﬁ l the prosodic requirement of bimoraicity.6
8.1.4 *V–V resolution in the inﬂ ection of ﬁ nal-weak stems
Pre-suﬃ  x vowel lengthening in Cairene occurs in all pre-suﬃ  xal environments 
except when a vowel-initial subject marker is suﬃ  xed to the perfect stem of a 
vowel-ﬁ nal (ﬁ nal-weak) verb, or a vowel-initial gender/number suﬃ  x to the stem 
of a vowel-ﬁ nal active participle. The suﬃ  xation of a vowel-initial morpheme to a 
vowel-ﬁ nal stem violates the requirement that syllables take an onset (see Sections 
4.4.1.2 and 9.1.2.3):
Where a ﬁ nal-weak verb or active participle stem takes a vowel-initial suﬃ  x, the 
requirement in (17) is met through one of two complementary repair processes. 
When the verb stem ends in /a/ (/ƒ/ in San’ani), the leftmost vowel is deleted on 
suﬃ  xation (cf. Sections 6.5.6.1 and 7.1.3.1 for San’ani)—see (18).

When the verb stem ends in /i/ (/¤/ in San’ani), glide formation takes place to pro-
vide an onset for the unsyllabiﬁ ed vowel, as in the following examples:

/mƒl¤ + ih/ 
mƒliyih 
‘full f.s.’
 
 
/mƒl¤ + ¤n/ 
mƒliy¤n 
‘full m.pl.’
In Cairene, glide formation takes place through association of the leftmost vocalic 
matrix with the adjacent syllable node, as in (10b) above.
The output of glide formation, *nisiyit, is subject to syncope (see Section 4.4.2.1) 
to give the realization nisyit ‘she forgot’.
In San’ani, glide formation is accompanied by delinking of the rightmost mora 
of the stem template, as in (21).
Deletion of /a/ (/ƒ/ in San’ani) prevocalically is attested in other areas of the 
phonology to resolve the constraint on onsetless syllables (see Section 9.1.2.1). 
However, in neither dialect is it attested elsewhere in the lexicon: when an a-ﬁ nal 
morpheme is concatenated with the {ﬁ rst person singular} possessive suﬃ  x, which 
is vowel-initial post-consonantally, the suﬃ  x takes the glide-initial allomorph, /ya/ 
(see Section 7.2.2.2). Thus, while umm + {ﬁ rst person singular} is realized as

umm¤ ‘my mother’ in San’ani and ummi in Cairene, San’ani amƒ + {ﬁ rst person 
singular} is realized as amƒya ‘my husband’s brother’, gafƒ + {ﬁ rst person singu-
lar} as gafƒya ‘behind me’ and warƒ + {ﬁ rst person singular} as warƒya ‘behind 
me’. In Cairene, an a-ﬁ nal morpheme is subject to pre-suﬃ  x lengthening before 
the glide, to give, for example, /ama + ya/ > amƒya ‘my father-in-law’ and 
/maca + ya/ > macƒya ‘with me’.
The glide formation characteristic of ﬁ nal-weak verb stems ending in /i/ is also 
attested in other areas of the phonology to resolve the constraint on onsetless 
syllables (see Sections 8.1.2 and 9.1.2.2). However, in the lexical component, 
this process only occurs without y-strengthening in Cairene when a vowel-initial 
inﬂ ectional suﬃ  x is aﬃ  xed to the verb stem or active participle of a ﬁ nal-weak 
root. In all other cases, including the inﬂ ection of non-participial ﬁ nal-weak adjec-
tives, the vowel of the pre-suﬃ  xal morpheme is subject to y-strengthening. The 
examples in (19a) compare with those in (22).

8.1.5 Diphthong reduction and n-strengthening (in SA)
In Chapter 4 we saw that the diphthong of the {feminine plural} subject suﬃ  x -ayn 
is reduced to -a- before the negative suﬃ  x -š, and in fast speech the diphthong of 
function words and linking verbs may be reduced and the function word or linking 
verb procliticized (see Section 4.4.1.3). The maintenance of diphthongs in identi-
cal phonological environments where other lexical items are involved, as in bayn 
ancƒ wa-tacizz ‘between San’a and Ta’izz’, indicates that Closed Diphthong Short-
ening is a lexical process which is motivated partly by syllable requirements.
 
Closed Diphthong Shortening also occurs when the {feminine plural} sub-
ject suﬃ  x takes an object suﬃ  x, but in this case it is accompanied by compensatory 
n-strengthening (cf. Section 8.1.3; Watson 1996: 102–3). Examples of diphthong 
reduction and n-strengthening include the following:

‘you f.pl. saw them m.’
 
/ʔabsartayn + ih/ 
ʔabsartannih 
‘you f.pl. saw him’
In contrast to Closed Diphthong Shortening, diphthong reduction and n-strength-
ening is not motivated by the requirements of the syllable—syllabically there is 
no reason for a sequence -aynih to be ruled out in favour of -annih: the sequence 
-aynih is attested in examples such as baynih ‘in it m.’ and daynih ‘his debt’. In 
the perfect of ﬁ nal-weak and doubled verbs, there is a (near-minimal) contrast 
between {third person feminine plural} and {ﬁ rst person plural} when a conso-
nant-initial object suﬃ  x is suﬃ  xed: the diphthong is maintained in the case of 
{ﬁ rst person plural}, but not in the case of {third person feminine plural}. Thus, 
bazzaynƒhƒ ~ bazzaynahƒ ‘we take her’ contrasts with bazzannahƒ ‘they f. take 
her’, and ištaraynƒhin ‘we bought them f.’ with ištarannahin ‘they f. bought 
them f.’.
Diphthong reduction and n-strengthening in pre-suﬃ  xal position is represented 
as delinking of the second element of the diphthong. Diphthong reduction is fol-
lowed by association of /n/ with the freed-up mora:
Following the erasure of morphological information, diphthong reduction and 
n-strengthening produces the output gƒlannih ‘they f. said it m.’.
In fast, casual speech, n-strengthening may fail to take place before consonant-
initial object pronouns (as in the case of monomoraic prepositions—see Section 
8.1.3). The following alternative forms are heard:

8.1.6 Pre-{negative} degemination (in SA)
In San’ani, ﬁ nal geminate consonants in verbs and pronouns degeminate before 
the negative suﬃ  x -š (see Section 4.3). This is in contrast to Cairene where suﬃ  xa-
tion of -š induces epenthesis. Compare the examples in (26).

ma yissiš

mƒ adš

Domain-ﬁ nal syllables can be no larger than CVCC, with the ﬁ nal C licensed as 
extrasyllabic (see Sections 4.3 and 5.2.5).7 Once suﬃ  xation of -š takes place, the 
right-leg of the geminate can no longer be licensed as extrasyllabic: /b/ is delinked 
from the extrasyllabic syllable node, and /š/ of the suﬃ  x associates directly with 
this syllable node in its stead:
Following TC and the erasure of morphemic nodes, pre-negative -š degemination 
produces the realization mƒ abš, represented in (28).
Pre-š epenthesis in Cairene is a purely syllable-driven process, since any sequence 
of three consonants will be broken up by epenthesis (see Section 4.4.1.1), and there-
fore constitutes a post-lexical process. By contrast, although the process is invoked 
in response to a constraint on the weight of the rhyme, pre-š degemination in San’ani 
qualiﬁ es as a lexical process, since degemination occurs only before the negative 
7 With the exception of syllables ending in Ctš (see Section 4.3).

suﬃ  x—when a morpheme ending in a geminate is concatenated with any other 
consonant-initial morpheme, structure is preserved by means of epenthesis, as in: 
yiibbukum ‘he likes you m.pl.’, ubbanƒ ‘our love’, and kullamƒ ‘whenever’.
8.1.7 h-disassociation (in SA)
/h/ has a limited distribution in Arabic. While it does form the initial consonant in a 
small number of relatively rare San’ani content words—including hawir ‘greedy’, 
habb–yihibb ‘to jump up’, harab–yuhrub ‘to ﬂ ee’, and hayl ‘cardamon’—it is 
most frequently attested as the initial consonant of the set of pronouns, including 
personal pronouns, demonstratives, locatives, and presentational particles. In a 
glossary of San’ani Arabic comprising 4,795 headwords and based on several 
hours of recorded monologues and dialogues, only 79 words are listed with initial 
/h/, of which 18 belong to the set of pronouns.
In a number of modern dialects, /h/ of the {third person} dependent pronouns 
is not realized post-consonantally. This is exempliﬁ ed in Central Sudanese 
bi-yaruba ‘he hits her’ versus nƒdƒha ‘he calls her’ (Persson and Persson 1979: 
165). In the Libyan dialect of Siirt, the original initial *h of the independent pro-
nouns is not realized in any phonological environment; thus, ‘he’ and ‘she’ are 
realized as ¶we and ¤ye (Fischer and Jastrow 1980: 53). In San’ani, in common 
with a number of other Yemeni dialects (Watson 1989: 140–1), /h/ of the {third 
person} independent pronoun is not realized when the pronoun is cliticized to the 
particles gad [copula], cƒd ‘still, yet (in negative)’ or miš ‘not’. Examples include 
those in (29).
(29) 
/gad + h¶/ 
gad¶ 
‘he is’
 
/gad + h¤/ 
gad¤ 
‘she is’
 
/cƒd + hum/ 
cƒdum ‘they m. are still’
 
/cƒd + hin/ 
cƒdin 
‘they f. are still’
 
/miš + h¤/ 
miš¤ 
‘not she’
 
/miš + hum/ mišum ‘not them m.’
Deletion of /h/ also occurs when a {third person singular} pronoun is cliticized to 
the question words man ‘who’, kayf ‘how’, kam ‘how many, much’, or ayn ‘where’, 
or to the particle inn ‘that’; /h/ of a {third person plural} pronoun is only deleted 
after ayn and inn in fast, casual speech—see (30).

/man + hum/

/kam + hin/

/inn + hum/ 
innuhum ~ innum 
‘that they m.’
 
/inn + hin/

h-deletion does not occur when the {third person plural} pronoun is an object or 
possessive suﬃ  x, however, even though the object/possessive suﬃ  x is homoph-
onous with the independent pronoun. Consider the following examples:
(31) 
/labbas + hum/ 
labbashum 
‘he dressed them m.’
 
/labbast + hin/ 
labbastahin 
‘I/you m.s. dressed them f.’
 
/bayt + hum/ 
baythum ~ baytuhum ‘their m. house’
 
/malƒbis + hum/ 
malƒbishum 
‘their m. clothes’
 
/min + hin/ 
minnahin ~ minhin 
‘from them f.’
h-deletion also fails to occur in the dialect when /h/ is the initial consonant of a 
morpheme other than a {third person} pronoun, as in the following examples:
(32) 
/cƒd + hilƒl/ 
cƒd hilƒl 
‘the crescent of . . . is still’
 
/inn + hƒnƒ/ 
inn hƒnƒ 
‘that here’
 
/inn + hƒnƒk/ 
inn hƒnƒk 
‘that there’
 
/man + hƒƒ/ 
man hƒƒ 
‘who is that m.?’
 
/man + hƒawlƒ/ 
man hƒawlƒ ‘who are they?’
Yemeni western mountain range, by contrast, pronoun h-deletion has extended to 
include /h/ of the demonstratives and locatives and occurs both post-consonantally 
and post-vocalically (Watson 1989: 138):
(33) 
/min + h¶na/ 
min¶na ‘from here’
 
/bi- + h¶na/ 
b¶na 
‘in here’
 
/man + hƒƒ/ 
manƒƒ ‘who is that m.?’
 
/man + hƒ¤/ 
manƒ¤ ‘who is that f.?’
The fact that h-deletion only occurs when the aspirate is the ﬁ rst consonant of the 
{third person} pronoun and only after a small subset of particles indicates that this 
is a lexical process which requires speciﬁ c morphological information. Deletion 
of /h/ of {third person} pronouns is represented as delinking /h/ from the syllable 
node to the right of speciﬁ c morphemes.

Following TC and the erasure of morphological information, /gad + hum/ is real-
ized as [gadum] ‘they m. are’ with the rightmost consonant of the particle syllabi-
ﬁ ed as the onset of the rightmost syllable:
8.1.7.1 Morpheme-ﬁ nal h-disassociation
The weakness of pronominal /h/ is also seen in the behaviour of morpheme-ﬁ nal 
/h/ in the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x and the homophonous 
nominal {feminine singular} suﬃ  x, -ih. In phonological-word-ﬁ nal position, /h/ 
of the object suﬃ  x is realized irrespective of whether the following word is vowel-
initial or consonant-initial. ‘I saw him in the house’ is realized as ʔabsartih ﬁ  l-bayt 
and ‘I saw him today’ as ʔabsartih al-yawm. Similarly, /h/ is realized when the 
morpheme falls in utterance-ﬁ nal position, as in ʔabsartih ‘I saw him’. Before the 
negative suﬃ  x -š, however, /h/ is deleted. In the examples in (36), the positive form 
is given in the left-hand column and the negated form in the centre column.

gultalih 
mƒ gultališ

In contrast to the examples in (36), stem-ﬁ nal /h/ in verbs is not subject to deletion 
before the negative suﬃ  x: yintabih ‘he pays attention’ is negated as mƒ yintabihš 
and y¶bih ‘he looks after’ as mƒ y¶bihš. This indicates that h-deletion in this case is 
a lexical process which requires the morphological information {third person mas-
culine singular}. Deletion of /h/ of the {third person masculine singular} object 
suﬃ  x is represented as delinking /h/ from the syllable node to the left of the nega-
tive suﬃ  x.
Following TC and the erasure of morphological information, -š of the negative suf-
ﬁ x is syllabiﬁ ed within the preceding syllable.
/h/ of the nominal {feminine singular} suﬃ  x only ever occurs in phonological 
word-ﬁ nal position. The aspirate of this morpheme is phonologically weaker than

that of the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x, and is realized only 
when a word with an initial consonant follows, or in phonological phrase-ﬁ nal pos-
ition. Before the deﬁ nite article or a vowel-initial word, /h/ is subject to deletion in 
all but the most careful of speech. The resulting V–V sequence is then resolved by 
vowel deletion (see Section 9.1.2.1). Compare the following examples:
(38) 
madrasih kab¤rih vs. al-madrasi l-kab¤rih 
‘a/the big school’
 
marih mag¶buh vs. al-mari l-mag¶buh 
‘a/the diligent woman’
 

alƒ
ih ciyyƒl 
vs. 
alƒ
i yyƒm 
‘3 children/3 days’
This can be summarized as a negative constraint on the realization of /h/ of the 
{feminine singular} suﬃ  x in intervocalic position. Voiceless consonants often 
weaken intervocalically in San’ani (see Section 9.2.7). Intervocalic lenition of /h/ 
results in voicing and reduction of frication. Only in the case of /h/ of the nominal 
{feminine singular} suﬃ  x does lenition result in total deletion of the laryngeal fric-
ative. The forms in the right-hand column in (38) contrast with the following forms 
in which an albeit lenited /h/ does surface intervocalically: absartih al-yawm ‘I 
saw him today’ (see above), mušƒbahah ‘similarity’, nƒh¤ ‘okay, good’, and yinta-
bih¶ ‘they m. pay attention’. Thus, deletion of intervocalic /h/ requires the infor-
mation {feminine singular}. In the majority of modern Arabic dialects, including 
Cairene, /h/ no longer constitutes part of the nominal {feminine singular} mor-
pheme. In these dialects, it is probable that deletion of /h/ of the {feminine sin-
gular} morpheme intervocalically became generalized to all syllabic positions 
until the phonological representation of the morpheme was reanalysed as a simple 
vowel, /a/ in some dialects, and /i/ in others.
8.2 MELODIC PROCESSES
The lexical melodic processes considered in this chapter involve total assimilation 
of adjacents. This contrasts with the majority of post-lexical melodic processes 
examined in Chapters 9 and 10, which involve the undergoer assimilating a por-
tion of the matrix of the trigger. I assume, along the lines of Mohanan (1993), that 
an assimilatory situation is one in which two units have conﬂ icting speciﬁ cations 
with the speciﬁ cation of the one overriding that of the other (Mohanan 1993: 89). 
In an assimilation process /tk/ > [kk], for instance, the place feature [dorsal] over-
rides the feature [coronal]. When the speciﬁ cation of X overrides the speciﬁ cation 
of Y, X is said to be the trigger and Y the undergoer (Mohanan 1993: 89).
Assimilation tends to adhere to the notion of dominance. Where X overrides Y, 
X can be said to be dominant with respect to Y. Dominance is manifest in a number 
of areas: certain phonological features are more dominant than others: [sonorant] 
is a weak feature, for example, and the target of assimilation is usually the more 
sonorous consonant. Conversely, the trigger is the less sonorant consonant, and 
sonorants rarely trigger assimilation: in San’ani and Cairene nasal place assimila-
tion, /n/ will acquire the place features of a following obstruent within the phono-

8.2 melodic processes
215
logical word, but rarely the place features of a following palatal or labio-velar 
glide: San’ani yinbac is realized as yi[m]bac ‘he jumps’, but yinw¤ ‘he intends’ is 
usually realized as yi[n]w¤. Place features are also not of equal strength; oral conso-
nants are dominant with regard to non-oral consonants, and in a series of stops /k, 
p, t/, the velar /k/ tends to be more dominant than labial /p/ and dental–alveolar /t/, 
and labial /p/ to be more dominant than dental–alveolar /t/. This indicates that the 
place feature distinguishing /t/ is weaker than the feature distinguishing /p/, which 
in turn is weaker than the feature distinguishing /k/. When an assimilatory process 
involving /k/ and /t/ takes place, it is therefore more likely that /t/ will assimilate 
in place to /k/ than that /k/ will assimilate in place to /t/. Examples of this can be 
adduced from fast speech phenomena in English, where ‘hot cakes’ is realized as 
[hɒkkeyks] and ‘hot potatoes’ as [hɒppəteytowz] (Mohanan 1993: 71), but ‘sick 
toads’ is not realized as *[sittowdz].
Dominance is also linked to the relative position of trigger and undergoer. The 
undergoer of assimilation is more likely to be in the syllable coda than in the syl-
lable onset, and the undergoer of assimilation is likely to be the preceding element. 
Conversely, the trigger is likely to be in the syllable onset and to follow the under-
goer: in nasal place assimilation /n/ assimilates in place to a following obstruent, 
but not to a preceding obstruent. Thus, San’ani tanf¤s is realized as ta[]f¤s ‘pass-
ing wind’, but afnƒn ‘mental or sensual activities’ is realized as af [n]ƒn.
The smaller the domain, the more likely it is that an assimilation process will 
take place. Mohanan expresses this observation in two complementary statements, 
‘The force of attraction is stronger in a smaller domain than in a larger domain’ 
(Mohanan 1993: 93) and ‘A sequence that undergoes place assimilation in a larger 
domain will also undergo place assimilation in a smaller domain’ (Mohanan 1993: 
96). Again taking examples from nasal place assimilation, /n/ always assimilates in 
place to a following consonant within the phonological word, but in careful speech 
may not assimilate across a word boundary; this is exempliﬁ ed in San’ani minayn 
baš¤r ‘from where is Bashir?’ or minaym baš¤r, gadin misƒﬁ rƒt ‘they f. are travel-
ling’ or gadim misƒﬁ rƒt.
Mohanan’s observations can be summed up as in (39).
(39) Dominance in assimilation
 
1.  Certain features are more dominant than others: [−son] is dominant in 
relation to [+son]; in consonants, [dorsal] is dominant in relation to 
[la bial] which is dominant in relation to [coronal].
 
2. The onset is dominant (with respect to the coda).
 
3.  The following element is dominant (with respect to the preceding ele-
ment).
 
4.  The force of attraction is stronger in a smaller prosodic domain than in a 
larger domain.
 
5. The strength of assimilation is
 
 
(a) directly proportional to the dominance of the trigger, and
 
 
(b) inversely proportional to the dominance of the undergoer.

lexical phonology
216
Finally, lexical assimilatory processes involve total assimilation, whereas post-lex-
ical processes are likely to involve partial assimilation and may be gradient. In 
this way, lexical processes are structure preserving insofar as total assimilation 
will never result in a segment which is not part of the underlying inventory of the 
language, whereas post-lexical processes may not be structure preserving. This 
distinction can be appreciated by considering lexical and post-lexical processes 
which involve the same underlying consonants. When -l of the deﬁ nite article 
assimilates to a following palatoalveolar, it assimilates all the root, stricture, laryn-
geal, and place features of the following palatoalveolar. Thus, il-šams ‘the sun’ in 
Cairene is realized as [iš-šams]. When /l/ assimilates to a following palatoalveolar 
postlexically, however, the lateral assimilates the place features of the trigger seg-
ment, but not the laryngeal or manner features: /l/ in ma-daxalš ‘he didn’t go in’ in 
8.2.1 The role of the Obligatory Contour Principle
Many cases of assimilation within both the lexical and the post-lexical compo-
nents take place in response to a violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle (see 
Section 6.3) on a particular autosegmental tier within a particular morphological 
or phonological domain. Yip (1988) and van der Hulst (1988) reached the conclu-
sion that the OCP could apply, not only to identical root nodes, but also to various 
autosegmental tiers below the root node. The principle behind this assumption is 
formalized by van der Hulst (1988: 99) as (40).
(40) The OCP ignores diﬀ erences in dependent information.
Principle (40) is parametrized such that ‘languages choose the hierarchical level 
at which it is relevant’ (van der Hulst 1988: 102). If a language bans adjacent gut-
turals absolutely, [G] [G] will be avoided irrespective of any other feature informa-
tion in the adjacent matrices. The scope or domain of the OCP can be limited, 
however, by statements which restrict its applicability to a particular tier in a 
particular context (McCarthy 1994: 206). The applicability of the OCP on the 
[coronal] tier, for example, may be restricted to adjacents which share the feature 
[sonorant]. The assimilation processes examined in this chapter take place in 
response to a violation of the OCP on the [coronal] tier within a particular mor-
phological domain. In Chapter 9, we will see examples of post-lexical assimila-
tion processes which occur in response to violations of the OCP on the [coronal], 
[guttural], and [dorsal] tiers. Of these, violations of the OCP on the [guttural] tier 
ignore all feature information other than [guttural], whereas the domain of the 
OCP on the [coronal] and [dorsal] tiers is restricted to particular contexts.
8.2.2 Assimilation of -l of the deﬁ nite article
In all known Arabic dialects for which the deﬁ nite article is either /al/ or /il/, -l 
form part of the lexical inventory of the language.
Cairene is realized as a voiceless palatoalveolar lateral, a sound which does not

of the article assimilates totally to the following coronal consonant of the deﬁ ned 
word (cf. Erwin 1963: 92 for Iraqi; Grand’henry 1976: 14 for Central Algerian; 
Haddad and Kenstowicz 1980 for Lebanese; Hamid 1984: 106 for Central Sudan-
ese; Abumdas 1985: 137–8 for Eastern Libyan; Shahin 2000: 18 for Abu Shusha 
Palestinian; Al-Saqqaf 1999: 162-3 for Hadrami; Al-Azraqi 1998: 144 for Abha).

In Cairene, but not in San’ani, -l of the article assimilates optionally to a following 
velar plosive. According to my Cairene informant, assimilation to a velar plosive 
is more likely to occur in fast speech. In careful speech, the forms in the left-hand 
column will be given, while in faster speech the forms in the right-hand column 
will be given.

As in Standard Arabic (Wright 1971: 15) and a number of Peninsula dialects 
including Hadrami (Al-Saqqaf 1999: 162–3), however, -l of the article fails to 
assimilate to a following palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate /j/ in San’ani. The reasons for this 
are probably historical rather than phonological, since present-day /j/ goes back 
to a Proto-Semitic and pre-Classical Arabic voiced velar plosive *g (cf. Section 
1.1.1). Assimilation of -l predictably failed to take place before velar *g, and 
this lack of assimilation persisted in several dialects even after *g was fronted 
historically to a palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate. San’ani contrasts with a number of mod-
ern dialects in which -l does assimilate to a following /j/ or //. These include Cen-
tral Sudanese (Persson and Persson 1979: 29; Hamid 1984: 106), Eastern Libyan 
(Abumdas 1985: 138), and Palestinian (Shahin 2000: 18). The assimilation of -l 
to a coronal plosive or continuant compares with non-assimilation when the initial 
consonant of the noun or adjective is either an aﬀ ricate or a non-coronal.

In both Cairene and San’ani assimilation of -l is clearly a lexical process since 
/l/ within any other morpheme fails to assimilate totally to a following coronal 
obstruent (or velar plosive), although it does assimilate to a following sonorant, 
/r/ or /n/ (see Section 9.2.2). The examples of assimilation in (41), (42), and (44) 
compare with those in (46) in which assimilation fails to take place.

In order to test the productivity of -l assimilation in Cairene further, I gave my 
Cairene informant a set of nonce words with initial coronals or velar plosives. She 
pronounced the words and then deﬁ ned them by means of the article. Coronal-
initial words were pronounced with total assimilation of the article to the following 
coronal. In the case of words with initial velar plosives, my informant explained 
that ‘the /l/ would not be pronounced if you spoke quickly or didn’t think while 
you were speaking’. In word-list readings, however, no assimilation of -l to /k, g/ 
took place. The following forms were elicited:

In view of the fact that a velar plosive is dominant with respect to a coronal, and 
that anticipatory assimilation of -l to a coronal is obligatory while assimilation to 
a velar occurs only in fast, casual speech, I assume that Cairene -l assimilation 
involves two separate processes. Assimilation to a following coronal is motivated 

lexical phonology
220
by an OCP violation on the coronal tier. Assimilation to a following velar plosive 
is motivated by the dominance of the trigger (/k, g/) in relation to the weakness of 
the undergoer (/l/).
8.2.2.1 Assimilation of -l to a coronal
Total assimilation of -l to a following coronal is due to an OCP violation on the 
coronal tier within a speciﬁ c morphological domain. TC occurs prior to assimila-
tion since the coronal consonant of the noun has to be linearly adjacent and visible 
to -l of the deﬁ nite article in order to trigger the OCP violation; however, we have 
also seen that assimilation to a coronal obstruent occurs only in case the undergoer 
is -l of the deﬁ nite article. This indicates that while TC erases the phonological cue 
for morphemic distinction, it is not equatable with the erasure of morphological 
information. Assimilation of -l of the article to a following coronal applies in two 
stages: at stage one, TC acts to fold together the morphemes in a linear conﬁ gur-
ation:
The morpheme nodes are still present at the point of linearization. At stage two, 
an OCP violation is apparent on the coronal tier within a speciﬁ c morphological 
domain. In response to the OCP violation, the root node of the leftmost matrix (the 
matrix associated with /l/) is deleted. The vacuum created by deletion of the root 
node is ﬁ lled by right-to-left spread of the root node of the adjacent coronal. The 
process is represented notationally in (50). (Only immediately relevant features 
represented; given the diﬃ  culties in representing three-dimensional structures two-
dimensionally, in the following diagrams X-slots are used to represent elements of 
the skeletal tier.)

It is only at this point that erasure of morpheme nodes takes place, and the output 
is subject to post-lexical phonological processes. These include the devoicing of 
voiced geminate plosives in San’ani, and, in Cairene, the palatalization of coronal 
stops in the environment of palatal vocoids.
8.2.2.2 Assimilation of -l to a velar plosive (in CA)
The optional assimilation of -l to a velar plosive in Cairene is also a lexical pro-
cess, since /l/ does not assimilate to /k/ within morphemes or across morphemes 
other than the deﬁ nite article + noun/adjective. In this case, however, assimilation 
is not motivated by the OCP, but rather by the dominance of the trigger vis-à-vis 
the undergoer (cf. Mohanan 1993). Following TC, the velar plosive lies to the right 
of the [coronal] lateral. The velar plosive is now dominant by virtue of its position 
(the onset, the following element), its lack of sonority (the less sonorant element 
is dominant), and its place feature ([dorsal] is dominant with respect to [coronal], 
see (39)). In addition, the faster the speech the more likely assimilation will take 
place. Assimilation of -l to a following velar plosive is represented as deletion of 
the root node of the matrix associated with /l/, and right-to-left spread of the root 
node of the dominant feature matrix for /k, g/.

In Cairene, t- of the detransitivizing preﬁ x (see Section 6.5.4) assimilates totally to

such as those in (52a) are attested in other areas of the phonology (see Section

to occur when any other morphemes are involved. The examples in (52b) compare 
with forms such as bi-ts¤b ‘she/you m.s. leave (something)’, bi-t¶m ‘she/you m.s. 
fast’, ma katabitš ‘she did not write’, and bi-tkubb ‘she/you m.s. pour/s’, in which 
total anticipatory assimilation does not occur. This indicates that total assimilation 
of t- of the detransitivizing preﬁ x to a following velar plosive or a coronal sibilant 
is a lexical process.
As for assimilation of -l of the deﬁ nite article, assimilation of t- to a following 
coronal is motivated by an OCP violation on the coronal tier. Again, assimilation 
occurs in two stages. At stage one, TC acts to fold together the morphemes in a 
linear conﬁ guration.
At stage two, an OCP violation is apparent on the coronal tier within a speciﬁ c 
morphological domain. In response to the OCP violation, the root node of the left-
most matrix (the matrix associated with /t/) is deleted. The vacuum created by dele-
tion of the leftmost root node is ﬁ lled by right-to-left spread of the root node of 
the adjacent coronal. The assimilation of t- to a following sibilant is represented 
notionally in (55).

At this point in the derivation, morpheme nodes are deleted, and the resulting con-
ﬁ guration is a geminate sibilant. As for the optional assimilation of -l of the def-
inite article to /k/, the optional assimilation of t- to a following /k/ is due to the 
strength of the trigger in relation to that of the undergoer.
In San’ani, metathesized t- of the detransitivizing preﬁ x in form VIII, and the /t/ 
allomorph of the detransitivizing preﬁ x in forms V and VI (see Section 6.5.4) and 
quadriliteral form II (see Section 6.5.6) assimilates totally to an adjacent coronal

As in Cairene, San’ani t- assimilation is motivated by an OCP violation on the

and only occurs when the coronal trigger shares lack of sonorancy and lack of

8.3 conclusion

8.3 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I have considered prosodic and melodic processes which require 
access to morphological information. The majority of prosodic lexical processes 
apply prior to TC; however, the melodic processes considered here apply after TC 
but before the erasure of morphological information. These observations support 
the conclusion reached by Bat-El on the basis of evidence from Modern Hebrew 
that TC erases the phonological cue for morphemic distinction, but not the morpho-
logical cue. Morphological information is erased in two stages: stage one involves 
the linearization of morphemes through TC, stage two the erasure of morpheme 
nodes. Lexical processes may apply either prior to TC or after TC, but in all cases 
prior to the erasure of morpheme nodes. The melodic processes examined here 
also demonstrate that assimilation in Cairene is more pervasive than in San’ani: 
in the case of the deﬁ nite article, -l assimilates only when the trigger is a coronal 
sonorant, plosive or fricative in San’ani, whereas -l may also assimilate to a velar 
plosive in Cairene. In the case of the detransitiving preﬁ x, t- assimilates to an adja-
cent coronal plosive or interdental fricative in San’ani, but in Cairene may also 
assimilate to a velar plosive or coronal sibilant. The next chapter shows that assimi-
lation in the post-lexical component is also more general a process in Cairene than 
it is in San’ani.

POST-LEXICAL PHONOLOGY
This chapter examines phonological processes which occur following complete 
Tier Conﬂ ation and the erasure of morpheme nodes. These processes do not 
require access to morphological information,1 are purely phonologically condi-
tioned, and may introduce or refer to non-contrastive segments (cf. Kaisse and 
Shaw 1985: 4–5). An example of the introduction of non-contrastive segments is 
nasal place assimilation in Cairene and San’ani where /n/ to the left of a labio-den-
tal /f/ is realized as a labio-dental nasal—a sound which does not constitute part 
of the phoneme inventory. Another example is where the voiced bilabial stop /b/ 
is devoiced in utterance-ﬁ nal position in both dialects and realized as a voiceless 
bilabial stop—a sound which is not attested in the phoneme inventory of either 
dialect. As in Chapter 8, I consider prosodic processes and then melodic processes. 
Under melodic processes, I restrict the discussion in this chapter to local assimila-
tion processes. The long-distance spread of emphasis is examined in Chapter 10 
as part of a wider consideration of the phenomenon of phonological emphasis. 
While prosodic processes outweigh melodic processes in the lexical phonology, 
there are considerably more melodic than prosodic processes in the post-lexical 
phonology.
9.1 PROSODIC PROCESSES
Under prosodic post-lexical processes, I consider the shortening of unstressed long 
vowels in Cairene, the resolution of *V–V sequences in the dialects, and gemina-
tion of a clitic-ﬁ nal sonorant before a vowel-initial phonological word in San’ani. 
The shortening of unstressed long vowels is related to word-stress assignment; the 
resolution of *V–V sequences is a syllable-driven process; and gemination of a 
clitic-ﬁ nal sonorant is motivated by the requirements of the Prosodic Morphology 
Hypothesis. The mainly post-lexical syllable-driven processes of closed syllable 
shortening, closed diphthong shortening, epenthesis, glottal-stop prosthesis, and 
syncope are treated separately in Chapter 4.
9.1.1 Unstressed long vowel shortening (in CA)
In Cairene, long vowels are shortened if unstressed. Thus, with a very few lexical-
1 Although they may refer to structure above the word (Archangeli 1984b: 8).

9.1  prosodic processes
227
ized exceptions, of which ƒlibƒt ‘students f.’ is one, no word has more than one 
long vowel. The few lexicalized exceptions are considered to be frozen high-level 
forms (usually from Standard Arabic), and do not constitute counter-evidence to 
the rule of unstressed long vowel shortening in Cairene.
Shortening of unstressed long vowels takes place in both derived and underived 
environments. In a word with two original long vowels, such as *ƒb¶n ‘soap’, 
stress is assigned to the ﬁ nal CVVC syllable, and the unstressed long vowel is 
shortened, to give ab¶n ‘soap’. Similarly, broken plurals with two long vowels in 
Standard Arabic and in dialects such as San’ani are realized with a ﬁ nal stressed 
long vowel only in Cairene (cf. Section 6.6):

‘two books’
 
/gin¢h + ƒt/
ginahƒt 
‘pounds’
 
/šƒfu + (h)/
šaf¶(h) 
‘they saw him’
Unstressed long vowel shortening acts as a repair process in response to a con-
straint on unstressed long vowels. The repair process is expressed as mora dele-
tion:
When the unstressed long vowel is either of the mid-vowels /¢/ or /¥/, the melody is 
subject to the negative constraint on monomoraic mid-vowels (see Section 3.4.11). 
This holds in all but the most careful speech of educated speakers (Harrell 1957: 
55; Woidich 1999: 26, 49):

post-lexical phonology

Once /¢/ or /¥/ loses its bimoraicity, non-primary [guttural] is pruned. Shortened 
/¢/ is realized as [i] and shortened /¥/ as [u].2 This is exempliﬁ ed in the shortening 
of unstressed /¢/ in /b¢t + ¢n/ > bit¢n ‘two houses’:
9.1.2 Resolution of *V–V sequences
The minimum syllable in Cairene and San’ani is CV—that is, a syllable compris-
ing an onset and a short vowel (see Sections 4.2 and 8.1.4). No syllable may begin 
with a vowel in either dialect. This is expressed as a requirement for syllables to 
take an onset, repeated in (6).
When the morphology concatenates a vowel-ﬁ nal morpheme with a vowel-initial 
morpheme in violation of (6), the ill-formed representation is subject to one of 
the following repair strategies: within the phonological word or clitic group,3 one 
of the contiguous vowels is subject to deletion. Within the phonological phrase or 
utterance, either one of the vowels is subject to deletion, or the features of the left-
most vowel associate with the onset of the following syllable to produce a glide, or 
a glottal stop is epenthesized to form an onset to the unsyllabiﬁ ed rightmost vowel. 
Within the phonological word and clitic group, no optionality exists in either dia-
lect, whereas within the phonological phrase and, more so between phonological 
phrases, the repair process adopted by the speaker is dependent on the speed of

than San’ani, while San’ani exhibits more glide formation.
9.1.2.1 Vowel deletion
When the morphology concatenates a vowel-initial morpheme to the right of a 
 vowel-initial morpheme, vowel deletion occurs to eliminate an onsetless syllable.4

Within the phonological phrase, vowel deletion is the most likely repair process to 
occur in Cairene, and occurs in casual speech in San’ani. Examples include:
(8) (a) Cairene /xall¤ni aš¶f/ 
xall¤n aš¶f 
‘let me look!’
 
 
 
/da illi ana cayzu/ 
da ll ana cayzu 
‘that is what I want’

‘I saw him yesterday’
 
(b) San’ani /xall¤n¤ absir/

/ya cn¤ anƒ/ 
ya cni nƒ 
‘I mean I’
 
 
 
/ašt¤ azrag/ 
ašti zrag 
‘I want blue’
In Cairene, the identity of the deleted vowel in each case can be determined by 
observing the following hierarchy: /a/ takes precedence over /u, i/ and /u/ takes 
precedence over /i/. This is expressed informally in (9).
(9) Cairene vowel hierarchy
 
/a/ > /u/ > /i/
In a morphologically concatenated sequence /a/–/i/ (in either order), the deleted 
vowel will be the weaker vowel /i/, in a sequence /a/–/u/ the deleted vowel will 
be /u/, and in a sequence /u/–/i/ the deleted vowel will be /i/. In order to avoid an 
ad hoc statement such as ‘/u/ is deleted when adjacent to /a/, but not when adjacent 
to /i/’, I assume that the process of vowel deletion has two aspects, one concerning 
the prosody and one the melody. In terms of the prosody, the leftmost vowel of 
the V–V sequence is deleted since the leftmost position is weaker with respect to 
4 The weakness of the glottal stop in glottal-stop-initial words, but in Cairene not in words in which 
the glottal stop is the reﬂ ex of Classical Arabic *q, usually leads to glottal-stop deletion intervocalically 
and subsequent vowel deletion. Similarly, intervocalic h-deletion in San’ani leads to vowel deletion 
(see Section 8.1.5).

the rightmost (cf. Mohanan 1993; cf. Section 8.2); this is expressed as mora dele-
tion on the prosodic template. The moraless syllable node then incorporates the 
following unsyllabiﬁ ed mora into its syllable. Where the vowel associated with 
µii has equal or greater strength than the vowel associated with µi, the matrix of 
the µii vowel simply remains with the newly incorporated mora. This is expressed 
diagrammatically in (10).
Where, on the other hand, the vowel associated with µii has less strength than the 
vowel associated with µi, Dominance in Assimilation (see Section 8.2) assures that 
the more dominant one will override the less dominant vocalic matrix and associ-
ate with the newly incorporated mora:
In the sequence /a/–/u/, as in ana ummak > ana mmak ‘I am your m.s. mother’, the 
stronger vocalic feature [guttural] spreads from the disassociated leftmost mora 
and crowds out the weaker feature [labial]:6
In San’ani, the hierarchy of vowels and of vocalic features is the mirror image of 
that for Cairene: /u/ takes precedence over /i, a/, and /i/ takes precedence over /a/, 
expressed informally in (13).
(13) 
San’ani vowel hierarchy
 
/u/ > /i/ > /a/
Where two vowels of diﬀ erent quality are concatenated, the feature matrix of /u/ 
overrides the matrix associated with /i/, and the feature matrix of either /u/ or /i/ 
overrides the matrix associated with /a/. In San’ani, the phrase anƒ ummak is real-
ized as an ummak with deletion of the matrix associated with /a/ rather than dele-
tion of the matrix associated with /u/, as in Cairene, and in ya  cn¤ anƒ ‘I mean, I’,

the matrix associated with the deleted leftmost mora associates with the remaining 
(rightmost) mora to give ya  cni nƒ.
An analysis whereby the mora associated with the leftmost vowel is deleted 
and the feature matrix of the dominant vowel spreads from a deleted mora, express-
es the independence of the prosody from the melody and demonstrates that fea-
tures are lost if and only if overridden by features further up in the feature 
hierarchy of the language.
9.1.2.2 Glide formation
Within the phonological phrase, vowel deletion may resolve the anomaly of an 
onsetless syllable, as seen above. However, at or above this level in the prosodic 
hierarchy, vowel deletion is not obligatory. In both dialects, when the second word 
receives main sentence stress either glide formation or glottal stop epenthesis may 
apply to create an onset for the onsetless syllable. Of these two repair processes, 
glide formation is more common in San’ani, and glottal stop epenthesis more com-
mon in Cairene.
Whether vowel deletion or glide formation or glottal stop epenthesis take place 
may depend on speed of delivery, but may also depend on lexical considerations. 
For example, the vowel of the {third person masculine singular} object suﬃ  x is 
never subject to deletion in Cairene. In a phrase such as šuftu ana ‘I saw him’, 
vocalic features of the phonologically weaker phoneme /u/ associate with the syl-
lable node of the following onsetless syllable to provide a glide onset, as in šuftu 
[w]ana ‘I saw him’. Glide formation is represented as the feature matrix of the 
leftmost vowel spreading to associate with the syllable node of the following onset-
less syllable:
Similarly, where the rightmost word is stressed, vowel deletion may fail to take 
place in favour of glide formation, as in: iktibu [w]intu ‘you pl. write’.
In San’ani, glide formation often occurs in careful speech, particularly before 
a vowel-initial content word, as in: ʔabsart¤ umm¤ ‘you f.s. saw my mother’ or 
badaʔ¶ yudxul¶ ahl al-bayt ‘the people of the house began to come in’, which are 
usually realized as ʔabsart¤ [y]umm¤ and badaʔ¶ yudxul¶ [w]ahl al-bayt respective-
ly. However, in very slow, careful speech, glide formation may also occur before

vowel-initial function words and morphemes such as the deﬁ nite article al- and the

‘in the house’ can be realized as ﬁ  l-bayt (with CSS; see Section 4.4.1.3) or f¤ [y]al-
bayt. The derivation of f¤ [y]al-bayt is diagrammed in (16).
9.1.2.3 Glottal stop epenthesis
The ﬁ nal repair process invoked when the morphology concatenates a vowel-ﬁ nal 
and a vowel-initial morpheme is epenthesis of a glottal stop (Broselow 1976: 
23–6).7 This is a common process in Cairene, particularly before a vowel-initial 
content word which receives main sentence stress or which appears at the begin-
ning of a phonological phrase. In non-utterance-ﬁ nal position, glottal stop epenthe-
sis only ever occurs in foot-initial position—that is, to form the onset to a stressed 
syllable. Glottal stop epenthesis is represented as association of a syllable node 
with an empty onset (represented as a bullet on the segmental tier). The empty 
onset is then ﬁ lled by the default consonant [ʔ]:
In San’ani, intervocalic glottal stop epenthesis occurs only when a vowel-initial 
word is stressed at the beginning of a phonological phrase, as in: badaʔ¶ yudxul¶ 
[ʔ]ahl al-bayt ‘the people of the house began to come in’, gad¶ [ʔ]amar ‘it m. is 
red’ and g¶l¤ [ʔ]uskut ‘say f.s. shut up!’.
In contrast to the two other repair processes, glottal stop epenthesis is not 
restricted to intervocalic position. Prosthesis of a glottal stop is the only repair 
process available in both dialects when a vowel-initial morpheme occurs in utter-

7 In Watson (1989: 218–28, 1991), the glottal stop is argued to be the default post-lexical consonant 
in Arabic on account of its propensity to deletion in content words (see Section 2.1.11), its insertion to 
the exclusion of other consonants where the prosodic requirements of the language demand an onset, 
and its phonological lack of markedness: in the model adapted here, the glottal stop is distinguished 
by the place feature [guttural] and no other features. In the radical underspeciﬁ cation model of Watson 
(1989, 1991), in which a distinction is drawn between lexical and post-lexical default segments and 
features, the post-lexical glottal stop is underlyingly featureless and [guttural] is the default post-lexical 
feature.

ance-initial position. Vowel-initial morphemes which may occur utterance-initial-
ly are relatively rare in the two dialects. In Cairene, they include: imta ‘when’, the 
ﬁ rst and second person independent pronouns ana ‘I’, inta ‘you m.s.’ etc., the deﬁ -
nite article il-, the relative pronoun illi, the ﬁ rst person imperfect preﬁ x a- (as in 
aktib ‘I write’), a few native content words such as ism ‘name’, abb ‘father’, umm 
‘mother’, and a number of loan words including iksibr¢s ‘express’ and istub ‘stop!’. 
Vowel-initial morphemes which may occur utterance-initially in San’ani include: 
inn ‘that’, the deﬁ nite article al-, the relative pronoun alla¤ ~ all¤ ~ ill¤, the ﬁ rst 
and second person independent pronouns anƒ ‘I’, ant ‘you m.s.’ etc., the ﬁ rst per-
son imperfect preﬁ x a- (as in aktub ‘I write’), and a number of native content 
words and loan words. Vowel-initial words also result from prosthesis of a vowel 
before consonant clusters in the imperative of sound triliteral verbs, in the derived 
triliteral verb forms VII, VIII, IX, and X in both dialects, and in forms V, VI, and 
quadriliteral form II in Cairene (see Section 6.5.4). Utterance-initial glottal stop 
prosthesis is represented notionally in (18) (see Section 4.4.1.2).
In Cairene, glottal stop prosthesis also occurs in careful speech in phonological-
word-initial position, even when the word does not occur utterance initially or post-
vocalically. This can be attributed to the requirements of the Prosodic Morphology 
Hypothesis which states that a phonological word must comprise at least one foot, 
a foot must comprise at least one syllable, and a syllable requires an onset. There-
fore, in order that a phonological word fulﬁ l the requirements of lower units in the 
prosodic hierarchy, a glottal stop may be prosthesized in careful speech when a 
vowel-initial phonological word occurs after a consonant-ﬁ nal phonological word. 
This will occur as an alternative to re-syllabiﬁ cation of the word-ﬁ nal consonant as 
the onset to the following onsetless syllable, as in the following examples (. deline-
ates syllables in the bracketed examples).

šƒf [ʔ]ummi (~ ša.f um.mi) 
‘he saw my mother’
 
katab [ʔ]imtian (~ ka.ta.b im.ti.ƒn) 
‘he wrote an exam’
In careful speech, a vowel-initial noun such as abb ‘father’ will also be subject to 
glottal stop prosthesis to the right of a consonant-ﬁ nal clitic such as the deﬁ nite 
article or a monomoraic preposition.8

9.1.3 Gemination of clitic-ﬁ nal sonorant (in SA)
In San’ani, a glottal stop may be prosthesized in utterance-initial position or inter-
vocalically in phonological-phrase-initial position, but is rarely prosthesized post-
consonantally. When a vowel-initial noun or adjective is deﬁ ned by the deﬁ nite 
article or otherwise preceded by a sonorant-ﬁ nal clitic, the requirement for the 
phonological word to adhere to the prosodic requirements of the syllable is ful-
ﬁ lled by gemination of the clitic-ﬁ nal sonorant.9 Examples of sonorant gemination 
before a vowel-initial word in San’ani include those in (21).

al-lumm

/al + ism/

‘from before’
 
 
/  can + umm¤/ 
cann umm¤ 
‘about my mother’
 
 
/  can + ams/ 
cann ams 
‘about yesterday’
Gemination of the pre-vocalic sonorant is diagrammed as association of the son-
orant directly with the syllable node of the following phonological word. This is 
exempliﬁ ed in the derivation of /al-ibn/ > al-libn ‘the son’:

9 The weakness of the glottal stop in glottal-stop-initial words results in glottal-stop deletion in this 
position, and subsequent sonorant gemination.

9.2 melodic processes

In a few cases, association of /l/ with the syllable node of a following vowel-initial 
phonological word has led to the historical reanalysis of vowel-initial nouns as /l/-
initial:

→ ladƒh 
‘clothes’
 
*akamih → lakamih pl. likƒm ‘hill/s’
 
9.2 MELODIC PROCESSES
With the exception of the assimilation of adjacent gutturals, sonorant coronals, and 
sonorant dorsals, I argue that post-lexical melodic processes involve the undergoer 
assimilating a portion of the matrix of the trigger, even when the process results in 
the undergoer becoming identical with the trigger. This is the case in the assimila-
tion of adjacent coronal sibilants in Cairene and, potentially, place assimilation 
of adjacent coronals. The assimilation of adjacent coronal sonorants, the assimila-
tion of adjacent gutturals, assimilation of adjacent coronal sibilants, pal atalization 
of [dorsal] plosives, labialization of [dorsal] plosives and labialization of [dorsal] 
vowels are motivated by the OCP on one of the [coronal], [guttural] or [dorsal] 
tiers. Palatalization and labialization processes which are not motivated by a viola-
tion of the OCP involve spread of a non-primary feature from the trigger to a com-
patible undergoer. Two processes considered in this section involve the delinking 
rather than the spreading of a feature. Geminate devoicing in San’ani, an instance 
of consonant fortition (see Section 9.2.6), involves the delinking of [voice] from 
doubly-linked plosives and aﬀ ricates, and anticipatory devoicing involves the 
delinking of [voice] from an obstruent which is not followed by a [sonorant].
9.2.1 Nasal place assimilation
Nasal consonants in many languages are homorganic with a following obstruent 
(cf. Booij 1995: 64). In both Cairene and San’ani, underlying coronal nasals assim-
ilate in place to an immediately following consonant. Nasal assimilation of place 
is obligatory within the phonological word, but optional within the phonological 
phrase. Nasals rarely assimilate to a following vocoid (the glides /w, y/), and uni-
versally fail to assimilate to segments lacking an oral place of articulation (the 
primary [guttural]s /h, ʔ, , c  /). To the left of a [labial] or [dorsal] consonant, the 
unmarked nasal is weak in terms of its position (leftmost, the coda), its nasality, 
and its place feature [coronal] (cf. Section 8.2). In this position, the dominant 
place feature of the following consonant spreads from right to left overriding the 
weaker [coronal] feature, which is delinked. This is represented in (24).
Consider the derivations of San’ani jamb ‘side’ and bak ‘bank’:

post-lexical phonology
236
In both dialects, clitic-ﬁ nal /n/ assimilates in place to a following consonant. The 
following forms are attested in San’ani:
(26) 
/min kam/ 
mi[] kam 
‘from how many, much’
 
/min fayn/ 
mi[] fayn 
‘from where’
 
/min matƒ/ 
mi[m] matƒ ‘from when’
Nasal assimilation also occurs across phonological words within the phonological 
phrase. However, in careful speech, assimilation across phonological words may 
fail to occur. This is in accordance with Mohanan’s observations that the larger the 
phonological domain, the less likely the application of a phonological rule (see 
Section 8.2). The alternants in (27) are attested in San’ani.

In Cairene, but not in San’ani, the [labial] nasal /m/ may assimilate the place of a 
following velar plosive, but this process occurs only within the phonological word. 
Here the more dominant [dorsal] place feature of the velar plosive overrides the 
[labial] feature of the nasal: [dorsal] spreads from right to left, and the [labial] 
place feature of the nasal is delinked.
 
The degree to which adjacent consonants assimilate is greater in Cairene than in 
San’ani. In both dialects, place assimilation of adjacent coronals occurs within the 
phonological word. However, while assimilation of adjacent sibilants or adjacent 
coronal sonorants may occur within the phonological word in fast or casual speech 
in San’ani, it will be absent in careful speech and across phonological words. In 
Cairene, assimilation of adjacent coronal sonorants or sibilants occurs in all but the 
most careful of speech, and is usually not restricted to the phonological word. In 
the next section, I argue that sonorant assimilation, sibilant assimilation in Cairene, 
and place assimilation of an unmarked coronal to a marked coronal are motivated 
by an OCP violation on the [coronal] tier (cf. Section 8.2.2–3).
9.2.2 Coronal sonorant assimilation
The coronal sonorants (/n/, /l/, /r/) in Cairene optionally lose their manner of artic-
ulation and totally assimilate to a following coronal sonorant within the phono-
logical word (29a)–(29c) or within the clitic group (29d)–(29e) (Harrell 1957: 43; 
Woidich 1999: 38).

Assimilation of coronal sonorants to adjacent obstruents does not occur post-
 lexically, although it does occur lexically (see Section 8.2.2). The optional assimi-
lation of /n/ to /t/ in /bint/ (= [bint] ~ [bitt]) ‘girl’ and /kunt/ (= [kunt] ~ [kutt]) ‘I 
was/you m.s. were’ in Cairene is restricted to these lexemes and is an isolated, lex-
icalized instance of the weaker sonorant assimilating the features of the dominant 
obstruent. It is assumed, therefore, that assimilation of adjacent coronal sonorants 
is motivated by a violation of the OCP on the [coronal] tier when adjacents agree in 
sonorancy (cf. McCarthy 1994: 206). Thus, the domain of the OCP in this instance 
is limited to [coronal] in the context of [sonorant] (see Section 8.2.1). The OCP vio-
lation is resolved by deletion of the leftmost root node, with right-to-right spread of 
the remaining root node to ﬁ ll the vacuum left by deletion. ʔunna is derived from 
/ʔul + na/ ‘we said’ as in (31).
10 Anticipatory asimilation of /n/ to /l, r/ occurs in a number of other modern Arabic dialects, includ-
ing Omani (Shaaban 1977: 76), Central Sudanese (Hamid 1984: 150–2), and Eastern Libyan (Abum-
das 1985: 136). In the Upper Egyptian dialect of Qift, /l/ assimilates to /n/ within the phonological word 
(Nishio 1994: 32).

Total assimilation of a coronal sonorant to a following coronal sonorant is less 
prevalent in San’ani than in Cairene. In this dialect, the weakest coronal sonorant 
/n/ usually assimilates totally to a following /l/ within the phonological word (32a); 
the more dominant /l/ assimilates to a following /n/ within the phonological word 
in fast, casual speech; however /r/ fails to assimilate to following /n/, and among 
many speakers fails to assimilate to following /l/ (32c). /n/ is not attested to the 
immediate left of /r/ within the phonological word, but clitic-ﬁ nal /n/ assimilates 
to both following /r/ and /l/ in casual speech (32d).

The assimilation of /n/ to /l/ and /r/ is motivated by an OCP violation on the 
[coronal] tier when coronals agree in sonorancy, which is resolved by deletion of 
the root node of the weaker leftmost matrix and right-to-left spread of the root 
node of the dominant matrix. When /l/ is followed by /n/, however, assimilation is 
restricted to fast, casual speech in San’ani because the leftmost matrix (containing 
[lateral]) is dominant with respect to the rightmost (containing [nasal]); when the 
more dominant liquid, /r/, is followed by /n/, assimilation fails to take place. Thus, 
while the dominant segment in Cairene sonorant assimilation is determined solely 
in terms of its position (the rightmost), in San’ani the dominant segment is deter-
mined both in terms of its position (rightmost) and in terms of its feature content.

9.2.3 Assimilation of adjacent sibilants
When two sibilants come into contact within the phonological word or clitic 
group in Cairene, the leftmost sibilant assimilates the features of the rightmost. 
Ex amples given by Woidich (1999: 37) include:
(33) 
z + š > šš /ma xabazš/ maxaba[š]š ‘he didn’t bake’
 
š + z > zz /iš zayyak/ 
i[z]zayyak 
‘how are you m.s.?’
When the leftmost sibilant is emphatic //, however, the features of the dominant 
segment are assimilated by the weaker segment despite the undergoer occupying 
the dominant (rightmost) position:
(34)  + š >  /ma-xallaš/ maxalla[] ‘he didn’t ﬁ nish’
Harrell (1957: 41) implies that the cluster [sš] does occur in careful speech in nega-
tive combinations, although it is more likely to become [šš], and in word-ﬁ nal pos-
ition is usually reduced to [š] (Harrell 1957: 42). Across phonological words, [šs] 
and [sš] may occur, as in: maf¤š sitta ‘there aren’t six (of them)’ and fƒs šihƒda ‘Shi-
hada’s mattock’. However, these clusters are more usually replaced by [ss] and [šš] 
respectively (Harrell 1957: 42). Likewise, the palatoalveolar sibilant of miš ‘not’ 
optionally assimilates to /s/ or /z/ as in miz zayyu ‘not like him’ (< /miš zayyu/) and 
mis sahl ‘not easy’ (< /miš sahl/) (Abdel-Massih 1975: 50), which demonstrates 
that a more marked sibilant may assimilate the features of a following less marked 
sibilant. I assume that the assimilation of sibilants occurs in consequence of a vio-
lation of the OCP on the [coronal] tier when adjacents agree in stridency:
The OCP violation is repaired by deletion of the place features from the leftmost 
matrix. The empty place node is ﬁ lled by spreading of the rightmost matrix:

When a plain sibilant is adjacent to an emphatic sibilant, as in /s/, however, the 
emphatic feature [guttural] of the dominant segment reassociates to the rightmost 
matrix following deletion of the place features from the leftmost matrix. This is 
in line with the observation that phonologically stronger features are dominant 
with respect to weaker features, and thus strong features are less likely to be lost 
than weak features. This analysis is similar to that proposed for vowel deletion in 
Section 9.1.2.1 where the dominant feature matrix occupies the less dominant pos-
ition. Consider the representation in (37).

In San’ani, sibilant place assimilation is attested in casual speech, but only in case 
the rightmost sibilant is dominant with respect to the leftmost. Thus, the mech-
anism of sibilant place assimilation resembles that of sonorant assimilation in 
San’ani—dominancy is determined both in terms of the relative position and in 
terms of the relative strength of the undergoer vis-à-vis the trigger. In mƒ darasš 
‘he did not learn’, the relatively weak /s/ may assimilate the palatality (non-primary 
[dorsal]) of the palatoalveolar sibilant; when the order of the sibilants is reversed, 
however, as in miš sahl ‘not easy’, the dominant palatoalveolar sibilant resists 
assimilation to /s/. Similarly, in mƒ xallaš ‘he did not ﬁ nish’ the more dominant 
pharyngealized sibilant will resist assimilation. As in Cairene, this form may be 
realized as [mƒ xalla], whereby the dominant non-primary [guttural] feature 
from the deleted matrix reassociates rightwards overriding the less dominant non-
primary [dorsal] feature of the palatoalveolar.
9.2.4 Coronal place assimilation
The assimilation of adjacent sibilants is related to a more general process of [coro-
nal] place assimilation attested in both dialects. As in a large number of other lan-
guages, a plain [coronal] stop assimilates the place features of a following marked 
[coronal] obstruent. A plain coronal stop becomes palatoalveolar to the left of a 
palatoalveolar, pharyngealized to the left of a pharyngealized coronal and interden-
tal to the left of an interdental, as in the following examples from Cairene (left-
hand column) and San’ani (right-hand column).

Coronal place assimilation is again motivated by an OCP violation on the [coro-
nal] tier with repair by means of deletion of the leftmost matrix from the place 
node. The place features associated with the rightmost matrix spread from right-to-
left to associate with the vacated place. The anticipatory assimilation of a plain to 
a pharyngealized coronal takes place as in (39).

tion 8.2.3).
When a marked [coronal] is followed by an unmarked coronal stop, the non-
primary feature(s) associated with the deleted matrix may reassociate rightwards

9.2.5 Voicing assimilation (in CA)
In Cairene, an underlyingly voiceless obstruent assimilates [voice] from a follow-
ing voiced obstruent within the phonological word. In casual speech or when adja-
cent obstruents share a place of articulation, voicing assimilation may also occur 
across phonological words (cf. Harrell 1957: 32 ﬀ .; Woidich 1999: 36). Assimila-
tion of [voice] is expressed informally in (42).

Just as non-obstruents do not induce voicing in a preceding obstruent, voiceless 
non-obstruents do not assimilate [voice] from a following voiced obstruent. The 
voiceless gutturals /, h, ʔ/ fail to assimilate [voice] from a following voiced 
obstruent.

While anticipatory voicing has a number of exceptions, anticipatory devoicing 
in Cairene aﬀ ects all non-sonorants, including the primary gutturals. Examples 
include the following (from Woidich 1999: 37):
(47)

c + h >  
/machad/ 
ma[]ad 
‘institute’
In a model in which phonological features are unary and therefore the only active 
laryngeal feature is [voice], anticipatory devoicing appears to be problematic. 
However, in contrast to anticipatory voicing, there is no failure in anticipatory 
devoicing. I assume this asymmetry to result from the interaction of two separate 
processes, as in Lombardi (1991, 1995, 1996). Anticipatory assimilation of [voice] 
is the result of a right-to-left spread process in which [voice] spreads from a voiced 
obstruent to an obstruent which is not speciﬁ ed for voice—see (48).
Apparent anticipatory assimilation of voicelessness, by contrast, is due to a con-
straint on [voice] in non-sonorants when not followed by a tauto- or heterosyllabic 
sonorant. As in Lombardi, the devoicing of voiced non-sonorants is expressed as 
a ‘positive’ condition, rather than as a rule.12 In Cairene, this ‘positive’ condition 
(48)— •
[cons]
[cons]
•
[voice]
12 Observing that obstruents in the syllable appendix as well as the syllable coda are realized as 
voiceless in German, Lombardi expresses the constraint as the licensing of [voice] in obstruents when 
followed by a tautosyllabic sonorant, but not elsewhere (Lombardi 1991). In Cairene and San’ani, 
voiced obstruents occur to the left of sonorant stops as well as vowels, therefore the condition is general-
ized to license [voice] in obstruents to the left of a sonorant.

9.2 melodic processes
247
licenses [voice] in non-sonorants when followed by a sonorant, with no commit-
ment as to the syllable position of the following sonorant:
In all other positions, [voice] is delinked from a non-sonorant. This ‘positive’ con-
dition accounts for the maintenance of [voice] in syllable-onset position, as well 
as in syllable-coda position before a sonorant onset. Thus, apparent anticipatory 
devoicing results not from the spreading of [−voice], but rather from the delinking 
of [voice] from a non-sonorant when not followed by a sonorant. The eﬀ ects of 
(49) will be overridden by right-to-left spread of [voice] (48) when an obstruent is 
followed by a voiced obstruent. Thus it is partly the conﬂ ict between right-to-left 
spread of [voice] and the licensing of [voice] in non-sonorants to the left of sonor-
ants which leads to the apparent asymmetrical position with regard to adjacent 
consonants which diﬀ er in respect to [voice].
[Voice] does not spread from sonorants or from the voiced primary guttural / c/ 
since spread of [voice] (48) is restricted to obstruent triggers, a restriction itself 
due to the relative weakness of the non-obstruent in the syllable onset vis-à-vis the 
obstruent in the syllable coda. The only instance in which / c/ initiates spread of 
[voice] is where the undergoer is //, /h/ or /ʔ/, in which case undergoer and trig-
ger share a primary [guttural] place of articulation. The total anticipatory assimila-
tion of a voiceless guttural to / c/ is expressed as follows:13 adjacent gutturals are 
prohibited absolutely, constituting a violation of the OCP on the [guttural] tier. 
The OCP violation is resolved by deletion of the root node of the leftmost segment 
(cf. Section 9.2.2). The vacuum left by root-node deletion is ﬁ lled by spread of the 
rightmost root node. Thus, /ʔ/ assimilates to / c/ as in (50).

13 This is similar to assimilation of adjacent coronal sonorants discussed in Section 9.2.2. However, 
adjacent gutturals are banned absolutely in both Cairene and San’ani, whereas adjacent sonorant coro-
nals may be attested in San’ani if the leftmost sonorant is dominant with regard to the rightmost.

When the leftmost place matrix is more marked than the rightmost, the marked 
place feature of the deleted matrix reassociates rightwards. In both Cairene and 
San’ani, non-primary [guttural] reassociates rightwards from the pharyngeal in 
pharyngeal–laryngeal sequences. The rightmost matrix then spreads from right to 
left to ﬁ ll the vacuum left by deletion of the leftmost matrix:
The reassociation of marked place features ensures that words such as yuʔ cud ‘he 
stays’ (CA) and ma  chad ‘institute’ are realized as yu ccud and maad.
9.2.6 Voicing, devoicing, and geminate devoicing (in SA)
In a paper published in 1984, Jastrow observed that geminate plosives and aﬀ ric-
ates are realized without voice in San’ani. Thus, /gg/ is realized as [kk], /bb/ as 
[pp], /dd/ as [tt] and /jj/ as [t:š]. Examples include:
(52) 
/agg/ 
a[kk] 
‘right, belonging to’
 
/addƒd/

within morphemes but also across morphemes. In this latter case, the undergoer

may be a geminate which results from a previous assimilation process. The -l of 
the deﬁ nite article assimilates totally to a following coronal stop or fricative (but 
not to the aﬀ ricate /j/) (see Section 8.2.2). When -l of the article is followed by a 
voiced coronal stop, total assimilation takes place and the resulting representation 
is subject to geminate devoicing:
(53) 
/al-dƒyir/ > ad-dƒyir 
a[t-t]ƒyir 
‘the key’
 
/al-dawm/ > ad-dawm 
a[t-t]awm 
‘the dowm fruit’
Jastrow observed correctly that geminate devoicing does not aﬀ ect the sonorants 
/nn/, /mm/, /ll/, /rr/, /ww/, /yy/, or the continuants /zz/, /

/, //, //. We have 
already seen that continuants are less likely to undergo an assimilation process 
than non-continuants. This observation can be generalized to the claim that con-
tinuants are more likely to maintain their underlying feature speciﬁ cation than 
non-continuants. The lack of devoicing of geminate sonorants can be attributed 
to the Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1982), which states that where two rules/
constraints are in conﬂ ict, the more speciﬁ c rule/constraint takes precedence over 
the less speciﬁ c one. The Elsewhere Condition is formulated as follows (from 
Kiparsky 1982: 136):
(54) Elsewhere Condition
 
Rules A and B in the same component apply disjunctively to a form C iﬀ :
 
(a)  The structural description of A (the special rule) properly includes the 
structural description of B (the general rule);
 
(b)  The result of applying A to C is distinct from applying B to C. In that 
case, A is applied ﬁ rst, and if it takes eﬀ ect, B is not applied.
Geminate sonorants fail to devoice because the more speciﬁ c segment structure 
requirement [sonorant] > [voice] overrides the cross-segmental requirement of 
geminate devoicing (cf. Mohanan 1993: 107–8).
Geminate devoicing is partly due to the licensing of [voice] in obstruents when 
followed by a sonorant, and not elsewhere (see Section 9.2.5). It is also due to the 
coordinates of segment strength as laid out by Mohanan (1993: 103), and to the 
principle of Geminate Integrity. I shall consider these three factors in turn.
San’ani exhibits apparent anticipatory devoicing, but a far more limited degree 
of anticipatory voicing than Cairene. Anticipatory voicing does not always take 
place, and the degree of voicing appears to be directly proportional to the strength 
of the trigger, the weakness of the undergoer, the speed of delivery, and the casual-
ness of speech. The least dominant segment is more likely to undergo voicing 
assimilation than the most dominant, and the most dominant segment more likely 
to trigger voicing assimilation than the least dominant. The dominance scale for 
oral place is laid out in (55) (from Mohanan 1993: 91).

In San’ani, a voiceless plosive assimilates [voice] from a following voiced plo-
sive or aﬀ ricate, and, in casual speech, from a following voiced fricative; by con-
trast, a voiceless fricative will only assimilate [voice] from a following voiced 
fricative. Within the set of voiceless plosives, the coronals /t/ and // invariably 
assimilate [voice] from a following voiced plosive or aﬀ ricate, while velar /k/ 
assimilates [voice] in casual speech only. Within the set of fricatives, labial /f/ and 
the non-sibilant coronals almost invariably assimilate [voice] from a following 
voiced fricative, but the sibilants and the velar fricative /x/ assimilate [voice] in fast, 
casual speech only. Examples of voicing assimilation include the following:

Instances in which anticipatory voicing regularly fails to take place include combi-
nations in which the potential trigger is a non-obstruent—that is, a primary [gut-
tural] or sonorant—as in Cairene, or the potential undergoer and trigger diﬀ er in 
continuancy.14 The voiceless gutturals /h/, /ʔ/ and // do not assimilate voice from 
a following obstruent, although they do exhibit total assimilation to a following 
voiced pharyngeal, as in Cairene (see Section 9.2.5). Examples of the failure of 
anticipatory voicing from my data include those in (57).

The observation that anticipatory voicing is more likely to target stops than non-
stops, that coronals are more likely to be aﬀ ected than non-coronals, and that non-
sonorants, but not sonorants, trigger anticipatory voicing accords with (a), (c), and 
14 Haddad (1984, cited in Lombardi 1996: 18–19) observes for Lebanese that while a stop will 
assimilate the voicing value of a following stop or fricative, a fricative will only assimilate the voicing 
value of a following fricative. Thus, /ʔafz/ ‘jumping’ is realized as [ʔavz] (or [ʔaﬁ z] with epenthesis) and 
/lafz/ ‘pronunciation’ as [lavz] (or [laﬁ z] with epenthesis), but /wizk/ ‘victory’ is realized as [wizk] and 
/hiz-t/ ‘I got furious’ as [hizt].

(d) of Mohanan’s generalizations regarding asymmetries in place assimilation, as 
in (58) (Mohanan 1993: 76–7).
(58) Asymmetries in Place Assimilation
 
(a) Coronal asymmetry
 
 
i. If non-coronals undergo assimilation, so do coronals.
 
 
ii. If coronals trigger assimilation, so do non-coronals.
 
(b) Labial–velar asymmetry
 
 
If labials trigger assimilation, so do velars.
 
(c) Stop asymmetry
 
 
i. Non-stops do not undergo (the whole range of) assimilation.
 
 
ii. If non-stops trigger assimilation, so do stops.
 
(d) Sonorant asymmetry
 
 
i. If non-sonorants undergo assimilation, so do sonorants.
 
 
ii. If sonorants trigger assimilation, so do non-sonorants.
In contrast to the asymmetries of voicing assimilation, a voiced plosive is devoiced 
to the left of a voiceless consonant within the phonological word irrespective of 
the strength of the potential trigger vis-à-vis the potential undergoer.

Similarly, when a voiced aﬀ ricate or fricative precedes a voiceless consonant with-
in the phonological word, devoicing takes place irrespective of the dominance of 
the potential trigger vis-à-vis the potential undergoer.

By contrast, anticipatory voicing of a domain-ﬁ nal voiceless obstruent is not attest-

voiced in samsarat baš¤r ‘Bashir’s caravanserai’.

post-lexical phonology

Devoicing of a voiced obstruent in syllable-coda position does not only apply 
before a voiceless consonant. Devoicing also occurs occasionally in the stressed 
syllable of a phonological phrase when the undergoer is followed by a sonorant 
or voiced obstruent. The relatively few instances of obstruent devoicing to the left 
of a voiced consonant can be taken as further evidence that devoicing is a diﬀ er-
ent type of process from anticipatory voicing and has a diﬀ erent motivation. Exam-
ples of unprovoked devoicing include:
(62) 
/ajmal/ 
a[tš]mal 
‘more beautiful’
 
/yibil/

‘he spits out’
Devoicing of word-ﬁ nal voiced obstruents and sonorant stops also occurs in both 
dialects in utterance-ﬁ nal position (Jastrow 1984; Behnstedt 1985; Watson 1993b; 
Naïm-Sanbar 1994 and others for San’ani; Woidich 1999: 34 for Cairene). In 
Cairene, utterance-ﬁ nal devoicing of plosives is usually accompanied by aspira-
tion; in San’ani, utterance-ﬁ nal devoicing is accompanied by pre-glottalization

I assume that anticipatory voicing in San’ani results from the spread of [voice] 
from a voiced obstruent to an obstruent which is not speciﬁ ed for [voice]. As we 
saw above, and in contrast to Cairene, fricatives only assimilate [voice] from a fol-
lowing fricative, and, except in fast, casual speech, stops only assimilate [voice] 
from a following stop. Anticipatory voicing in San’ani is represented notationally 
as right-to-left spread of [voice] to an obstruent undergoer which shares the pres-
ence or absence of [cont] (represented here as [F]) with the trigger.
15 Pre-glottalization is never attested before a ﬁ nal laryngeal or pharyngeal. I presume this to be due 
to the OCP: insertion of a glottal stop to the left of a primary [guttural] violates the OCP on the [gut-
tural] tier; in the unmarked case, a process will fail to take place if the output would violate the OCP.

may be released as ejectives.

9.2 melodic processes

In contrast to Cairene, the voiced pharyngeal fails to devoice before a voiceless 
consonant or otherwise in syllable-coda position; hence devoicing in San’ani is 
attributed to the licensing of [voice] in obstruents, as opposed to non-sonorants, if 
and only if followed by a sonorant (cf. condition (49)). Licensing is expressed as 
the ‘positive’ condition in (65).
When an underlyingly voiced obstruent is not followed by a tauto- or heterosyl-
labic sonorant, [voice] is delinked. The eﬀ ect of this condition may be overridden 
by spread of [voice] from a following obstruent when trigger and undergoer share 
the presence or absence of [cont].
Let us now return to geminate devoicing. I have just claimed that delinking of 
[voice] in response to (65) holds in case the phonological environment for voice 
assimilation is absent. I have also said that geminate devoicing occurs partly in 
response to the condition in (65). These two statements are in conﬂ ict, since 
the presence of the voiced second element of the geminate should override the 
eﬀ ects of condition (65). However, in (62) we also saw that devoicing may occur 
in San’ani in the stressed syllable of an intonation phrase when the undergoer 
is followed by a voiced consonant. Thus, an underlyingly voiced obstruent may 
remain devoiced even when the phonological environment for voice assimilation 
is present. We also saw that anticipatory voicing is far less automatic a process 
in San’ani than it is in Cairene, depending both on the relative dominance of the 
trigger vis-à-vis the undergoer, and on the casualness of speech. At the beginning 
of this section, I also suggested that condition (65) may be one of three factors 
involved in geminate devoicing. The other two factors are the coordinates of seg-
ment strength, and Geminate Integrity.
Mohanan identiﬁ es four coordinates of segment strength (Mohanan 1993: 103)

Increase in segment strength corresponds to:
 
(a) Duration: increase in duration
 
(b) Voicing: voicelessness
 
(c) Sonority: decrease in sonority
 
(d) Oral conﬁ guration: deviation from the position of the neutral vowel
An examination of my San’ani data reveals an asymmetry regarding the frequency 
and degree of geminate devoicing: devoicing of velar /gg/ is more common, and 
far more complete a process, than devoicing of the palatoalveolar aﬀ ricate /jj/, 
labial /bb/, or alveolar /dd/. While devoicing of /dd/ often fails to take place, par-
ticularly in casual, non-emphatic speech, devoicing of /gg/ is almost exceptionless 
and often results in a slightly ejective realization. This is particularly the case when 
the left leg of the geminate falls in the stressed syllable of the phonological phrase. 
Thus, the frequency and degree of devoicing is proportional to the strength of the 
undergoer. This is summed up in (67).
(67) Geminate devoicing in San’ani
 
(a) Only geminates, and hence long segments, are devoiced;
 
(b) only stops are devoiced;
 
(c) only non-sonorants are devoiced;
 
(d)  the greater the deviation from the position of the neutral vowel, the 
greater the degree of devoicing and the more likely it is that devoicing 
will take place.
Given that one increase in segment strength corresponds to voicelessness, gemi-
nate devoicing can be seen as a process which enhances the strength of segments 
which are already strong by virtue of their length. Thus, geminate devoicing serves 
to increase the perceived diﬀ erence between short and long segments in the set of 
non-continuant obstruents.
Part of the motivation for geminate devoicing appears to be the licensing of 
[voice] in obstruents when followed by a sonorant, and not elsewhere. However, 
geminate devoicing involves both the left and the right leg of the geminate, and 
the right-leg of the geminate is followed by a sonorant (a vowel). According to 
the principle of Geminate Integrity, if one half of a geminate undergoes a rule, the 
other half of the geminate undergoes the same rule. If the right leg of the geminate 
cannot undergo the rule, then the rule will not take place (Kenstowicz and Pyle 
1973; Schein and Steriade 1986).
Evidence for the second part of this statement is observed in Persian and in 
Cairene. Persian has a rule changing a syllable-coda /v/ > [w], described by Hayes 
(1986: 332–3) as v-Weakening. Where geminates are involved, however, the /v/ > 
[w] rule fails to take place because [w] is barred from syllable-onset position: /v/ 
in nov is realized as [v] in the syllable onset in nov-i:n ‘new’, but as [w] in coda 
position in now-ru:z ‘New Year’. The left leg of geminate /vv/ in ævvæl ‘ﬁ rst’ or 
qolovv ‘exaggeration’ does not change to [w], however, because the right leg of 
the geminate is in syllable-onset position (Kenstowicz 1994: 412–13). Historically 
in Cairene, the diphthongs *aw and *ay coalesced in pre-consonantal position to 

9.2 melodic processes
255
be reanalysed as /¥/ and /¢/ respectively. Thus, the original forms *bayn ‘between’ 
and *bawl ‘urine’ came to be realized as b¢n and b¥l. Where the glide formed the 
left-leg of a geminate, however, coalescence failed to take place because the right-
leg of the geminate did not satisfy the structural description of the rule by virtue 
of occupying the syllable-onset. As a result, diphthongs were maintained in forms 
such as ʔawwal ‘ﬁ rst’ and miʔayya ‘septic’. These observations suggest the gen-
eral constraint on rule application in (68) (adapted by Kenstowicz 1994: 413 from 
Hayes 1986 and Schein and Steriade 1986).
(68) 
 In order to change the feature content of a segment [A], every skeletal slot 
linked to [A] must satisfy the rule.
[Voice] in obstruents is licensed in syllable-onset position, and San’ani prefers 
voiced obstruents in the syllable-onset (see Section 9.2.7); however, this is a weak 
preference, and does not bar voiceless obstruents in this position. The preference 
for syllable-initial voiced obstruents motivates voicing of underlyingly voiceless 
obstruents only in case the obstruent occurs in phonological-word-initial position 
or intervocalically, and is more likely to apply to coronals than to non-coronals. 
In all other cases, underlyingly voiceless obstruents are realized without voice in 
syllable-onset position. Examples of syllable-onset voiceless obstruents include:
(69) yidalhif¶ 
‘they m. push’
 
sƒ  cah

sa cduh 
‘Sa’da [place name]’
 
ʔƒtƒr 
‘remains’
 
kawkabƒn ‘Kawkaban [place name]’
 
ijtama c¶ 
‘they m. gathered together’
The rule of geminate devoicing overrides the preference for voiced obstruents in 
the syllable-onset due to the weakness of the preference in relation to the motiv-
ations for geminate devoicing—namely, licensing of [voice] in obstruents to the 
left of a sonorant and in no other position (65), the requirement to enhance strong 
segments, and the requirement to enhance the distinction between simplex and 
geminate non-continuant obstruents. Geminate devoicing is diagrammed as the 
delinking of [voice] from a moraic non-continuant which is potentially linked to 
two syllable positions.

9.2.7 Intervocalic voicing (in SA)
The processes considered so far involve a consonant trigger and a consonant under-
goer. Intervocalic voicing, palatalization and labialization, which I consider in this 
and the following two sections, are processes which involve a vocoid trigger and a 
consonant undergoer.
Just as strong segments have a tendency to increase in strength, so weak seg-
ments have a tendency to decrease in strength. In a large number of languages, 
stops lenite intervocalically. Across languages, intervocalic lenition involves 
degemination (as in Malayalam, Mohanan 1993: 101), voicing of voiceless plo-
sives (as in Malayalam and Welsh, Mohanan 1993: 101, 102), frication of voice-
less stops (as in Finnish, Mohanan 1993: 102; Tiberian Hebrew, Kenstowicz 1994: 
35), frication of voiced stops (as in Welsh, Mohanan 1993: 102; Spanish, Kensto-
wicz 1994: 35; and Hadrami Arabic, Al-Saqqaf 1999), and may ultimately result 
in the complete disappearance of the consonant, as in some dialects of Spanish. A 
decrease in segment strength corresponds to the following (cf. (66)):
(71) 
Decrease in segment strength corresponds to:
 
(a) Duration: decrease in duration
 
(b) Voicing: voicedness
 
(c) Sonority: increase in sonority
 
(d) Oral conﬁ guration: closeness to the position of the neutral vowel
In San’ani, consonant lenition is a relatively conservative process and involves 
voicing of intervocalic and word-initial voiceless simplex consonants in casual 
speech.16 In the case of the laryngeal and pharyngeal voiceless fricatives, inter-
vocalic voicing is accompanied by a certain reduction in the degree of frication. 
When the lenited consonant is a plosive, consonant lenition becomes the mirror 
image of devoicing of geminate plosives: in geminate devoicing, the strength of 
the strong (long) segment is enhanced by devoicing; in intervocalic and word-
initial voicing, the weakness of the weak (short) segment is enhanced by voicing. 
Since both intervocalic voicing and geminate devoicing most commonly aﬀ ect 
non-sonorant stops, the combined eﬀ ect of the lenition and fortition processes is 
to enhance the distinction between long and short non-sonorant stops.
Intervocalic and word-initial voicing in San’ani is an optional and gradient phe-
nomenon: among oral consonants, it aﬀ ects coronal plosives more frequently and 
to a considerably greater degree than velar plosives. Hence the weaker the underly-
ing phoneme, the more likely further weakening will take place through voicing. 
Furthermore, if a consonant is voiced word-initially, we can predict that it will be 
voiced intervocalically, since the weaker position is intervocalic. Voicing is also 
16 Lenition of word-initial and intervocalic coronal plosives in San’ani was ﬁ rst observed by Jas-
trow (1984). Jastrow assumed that the emphatic coronal plosive was regularly voiced in intervocalic 
and word-initial position, and that the non-emphatic /t/ began to be voiced on analogy with //. My 
larger data base shows consonant lenition is not restricted to coronals. It also includes laryngeal and 
pharyngeal voiceless fricatives, and, in the appropriate phonological environment, the velar stop /k/ 
and the interdental fricative /	/.

9.2 melodic processes
257
more apparent in fast, casual speech than in slow, careful speech. Where voicing 
targets velar /k/, the interdental fricative /	/ or the sibilant /s/, it does so intervocal-
ically, and at the beginning of an unstressed syllable. Voicing of the weaker coro-
nal plosives // and /t/, on the other hand, occurs at the beginning of a stressed or an 
unstressed syllable. Voicing of the laryngeal and pharyngeal fricatives is restricted 
to intervocalic position. In (72a) are examples of word-initial voicing, in (72b) of 
intervocalic voicing.

In at least one case, the result of intervocalic voicing has been reanalysed as a lex-
icalized form: San’ani speakers claim that the word matkƒʔ ‘arm-rest’ has a medial 
/t/, but that its plural ma[d]ƒk¤ ‘arm-rests’ has a medial /d/. By contrast, a word such 
as fata ‘he opened’, which is realized as fa[d]a, is invariably analysed by speak-
ers as /fata/ with medial /t/ and not as */fada/.
Intervocalic and word-initial voicing is analysed as an assimilation process 
whereby the syllable-onset consonant assimilates [voice] from the adjacent vowel, 
as in (73).
The stronger the obstruent, the more likely it is to resist assimilation of [voice] 
from the following vowel; hence obstruents which form the second part of a conso-
nant cluster fail to assimilate [voice]. Geminates fail to assimilate [voice] from a 
following vowel, because the left-leg of the geminate does not satisfy the structural 
description of the rule, as required by (68). In the case of word-initial obstruents, 
voicing fails to apply if the word is preceded by a word-ﬁ nal voiceless obstruent 
within the phonological phrase.
9.2.8 Palatalization
Palatalization of coronal and, to a lesser degree, dorsal stops occurs in both 
Cairene (Haeri 1997; Woidich 1999: 38) and San’ani. Cairene coronal palatali-
zation has two distinct outputs: weak palatalization, whereby the palatal feature 
manifests as a distinct secondary feature while the primary feature remains apical,

as in /t/ > [t j] and /d/ > [d   j]; and strong palatalization, which involves a switch in 
the place of articulation of the undergoer from apical to post-alveolar, as in /t/ > 
[tš] and /d/ > [].17 In the case of dorsal undergoers, only weak palatalization is 
attested. In San’ani, palatalization of coronal and dorsal stops occurs in fast, casual 
speech and most commonly manifests itself as weak palatalization.
In Cairene, palatalization is triggered by a following /y/, /i/, /i:/, /e:/, or the epen-
thetic vowel [i] (Haeri 1997: 58).

Palatalization is most likely to be triggered by a palatal glide and least likely to be 
triggered by a long mid-vowel /e:/. Word-ﬁ nal /i/ is more likely to trigger palatal-
iza tion than /i:/ (which never occurs word-ﬁ nally) or medial /i/. This discrepancy 
can be attributed to the height of the trigger segment: the higher the palatal trigger, 
the greater its palatality and hence the more likely palatalization of adjacent seg-
ments will occur. Word-ﬁ nal /i/ in bi-yibtidi ‘he begins’ is higher than the 
medial /i/ after /t/. Thus, /d/ in this case is more likely to be palatalized than /t/. 
Haeri ascribes the discrepancy between the palatalizing eﬀ ect of word-ﬁ nal /i/ 
and /i:/ to an observation by Bhat (1974) that unstressed high vowels are more 
likely to trigger pal atalization than stressed high vowels. In Cairene, /i:/ is always 
stressed—unstressed long vowels are subject to shortening—whereas, with the sin-
gle exception of the feminine demonstrative di ‘this’ (Broselow 1976; Haeri 1992: 
174, 1997: 60), word-ﬁ nal vowels are never stressed.
Palatalization in San’ani is far less apparent than in Cairene. Coronal palataliza-
tion occurs only when triggered by a following palatal glide /y/, and usually mani-
fests itself as weak palatalization, see (75a); palatalization of dorsal stops is most 
commonly triggered by a following palatal glide, but may also be triggered by a 
tautosyllabic long palatal vowel /i:/, see (75b). As in Cairene, dorsal palatalization 
only ever results in weak palatalization:

17 Recent sociolinguistic work on Cairene shows strong coronal palatalization to be a feature of 
younger women’s speech (Haeri 1997; Woidich 1999: 38).
18 The probability of strong palatalization in these latter two environments is very small (cf. below, 
Haeri 1997: 65).

9.2 melodic processes
259
In San’ani, /k/ is only palatalized by a preceding /i:/ when the undergoer is tautosyl-
labic with the trigger. Where /k/ is syllabiﬁ ed as the onset of a following syllable, 
as in hƒ¤k al-bint ‘that f. girl’, palatalization fails to occur.
Although the probability of palatalization is greater within the phonological 
word, palatalization also occurs across word boundaries within the phonological 
phrase. In Cairene, palatalization across word boundaries occurs most frequently 
when triggered by a palatal glide (Haeri 1997: 51, 61); in San’ani, palatalization 
across word boundaries may only be triggered by a palatal glide. In fast speech, 
palatalization of /t/ across a word boundary in San’ani often results in a palatoal-
veolar aﬀ ricate, whereas palatalization of /d/ almost invariably results in a weakly 
palatalized apical stop.

Palatalization is dependent not only on the trigger, but also on the potential under-
goer. In both dialects, voiceless /t/ has a higher probability of strong palatalization 
than its voiced counterpart /d/: Haeri’s ﬁ gures (1997: 64) show a .58 probability of 
strong palatalization for /t/ compared with .43 for /d/. In Cairene, geminate /tt/ is a 
third less likely to undergo palatalization than non-geminate /t/ (Haeri 1992: 170, 
1997: 54); in San’ani, the only examples of geminate palatalization I came across 
involve /dd/ in the pronoun add. The relative failure of geminates to undergo 
palatalization can be attributed to the strength of the long segment by virtue of its 
length and accompanying tenseness (cf. Mohanan 1993: 105), since the stronger 
the segment the more likely it is to resist assimilation (see Section 8.2). In Cairene, 
plain /t/ has a higher probability of palatalization than emphatic //, and plain /d/ a 
higher palatalization probability than emphatic //.19 In San’ani, palatalization of 
// is virtually unattested. The probability diﬀ erences between plain and emphatic 
coronals are due to the incompatibility of pharyngeal expansion characteristic of 
palatalization (see Section 3.4.4) with the pharyngeal constriction characteristic of 
pharyngealization (see Section 3.4.7).20
9.2.8.1 The palatalizing feature
The palatalizing feature in the model adopted here is non-primary [dorsal], where 
non-primary [dorsal] is interpreted in the default case as dorsum raising and 
19 Although Haeri does not explicitly mention /n/, the nasal coronal is also subject to palatalization 
(Al-Saqqaf 1999: 95).
20 According to Haeri’s ﬁ gures, // has a higher palatalization probability than /d/. Haeri attributes 
this to variability in the degree of pharyngealization, particularly before /i/ (Haeri 1992: 175–6). Pal-
atalization of // is often accompanied by de-emphasization (see Section 10.4.3). It therefore appears that

 pharyngeal expansion (see Section 3.4.4). Palatalization is a process which applies 
late in the derivation—after the default assignment of non-primary [dorsal] to a 
bare primary [dorsal] vocoid (see Section 3.4.4)—and involves the spread of non-
primary [dorsal] from a vocoid trigger to a stop undergoer. The undergoer of pal-
atalization either shares a primary [dorsal] node with the trigger, or is a primary 
[coronal] stop—the most likely segment to undergo place assimilation according 
to both the dominance scale (55) and the asymmetries in place assimilation table 
(58). I assume that dorsal palatalization is motivated by an OCP violation on the 
[dorsal] tier21 which is resolved by delinking of the leftmost place features. The 
resulting vacuum is ﬁ lled by right-to-left spread of the remaining place features:
Dorsal palatalization triggered by the weaker trigger /i:/ in San’ani occurs only 
where trigger and undergoer are tautosyllabic, expressed as the mirror-image proc-
ess in (78).
the pharyngeal expansion of palatalization may override the pharyngeal constriction of pharyngealiza-
tion in certain environments.
21 The constraint on adjacent dorsals is weaker than that on either adjacent gutturals, which is abso-
lute, or that on adjacent coronals, which depends on the identity of root and stricture features. The 
constraint on adjacent dorsals, weaker in Cairene than in San’ani, results in leftmost matrix deletion 
if and only if one of the adjacent dorsals lacks a non-primary feature. In Cairene, leftmost matrix dele-
tion does not take place in the context of non-primary [labial] unless adjacents share the root feature 
[sonorant] (see Section 9.2.10).

In the present model, there is no representational diﬀ erence between a palatalized 
velar and a palatal stop: both involve primary and non-primary [dorsal]. The diﬀ er-
ence in phonetic interpretation is language speciﬁ c, and within certain languages 
may be speaker speciﬁ c. In Cairene and San’ani, a non-continuant primary [dor-
sal], non-primary [dorsal] is interpreted as a velar with secondary palatalization. 
In other languages, the same phonological conﬁ guration may be interpreted as a 
palatal stop (Watson 1999b; Watson and Dickins 1999). The phonetic ambiguity of 
a single phonological representation either cross-linguistically or within a single 
language is accommodated within the abstract reductionist approach of the theory 
(Selkirk 1993: 74–5). The representation in (79) illustrates this state of aﬀ airs.
Coronal palatalization is represented as spread of non-primary [dorsal] from a [dor-
sal] vocoid to a [coronal] stop:
Spread of non-primary [dorsal] is interpreted in the [coronal] undergoer either as 
the addition of a secondary palatal articulation to a consonant whose main articu-
lation remains unaltered, or as modiﬁ cation of the primary articulation itself to 
palatoalveolar. In representational terms, there is no diﬀ erence between a weakly 
palatalized apical and a strongly palatalized coronal resulting in a palatoalveolar 
aﬀ ricate. Both are represented by primary [coronal] and non-primary [dorsal]. 
Here we see the phonetic ambiguity of a phonological representation within a sin-
gle language: in Cairene, the phonetic interpretation of primary [coronal] and non-
primary [dorsal] appears to be speaker-speciﬁ c; in San’ani, phonetic interpretation 
depends on speed of delivery.

Palatalization processes may involve any or all of pharyngeal expansion, dorsum 
raising, and spirantization (Bhat 1974). Cairene coronal palatalization involves 
all three features (Haeri 1997: 46); spirantization is weak in weak palatalization 
and strong in strong palatalization. I assume the output of coronal palatalization is 
assigned [strident] by default, as in (82).
The aﬀ ricate output of coronal palatalization is distinguished from the palatoalveo-
lar fricative /š/ by the presence of [cont] in the matrix of /š/ and lack of [cont] in 
the matrix of []/[tš].
9.2.8.2 Dissimilation in palatalization
In Cairene, palatalization is considerably less likely to occur when the potential 
undergoer is followed by a sibilant in the same word (Haeri 1992: 172, 1997: 53). 
In a form such as ad¤s ‘conversation, modern, tradition of the Prophet’ or a verb 
negated by -š such as ma rut¤š ‘I/you m.s. didn’t go’, palatalization of the coro-
nal stop occurs very rarely. The failure of palatalization in this phonological en-
vironment is due to dissimilation. Recall that where the morphology concatenates 
adjacent sibilants or coronal sonorants in Cairene, the leftmost sibilant/sonorant 
assimilates totally to the rightmost (see Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.3). This observa-
tion is expressed as a negative constraint on adjacent coronals which share either 
[strident] or [sonorant] (represented in (83) as [F]):

The output of palatalization is assigned [strident] by default. Palatalization of a 
coronal stop in the environment of a sibilant would therefore violate constraint 
(83), expressed as violation of the OCP on the [coronal] tier when adjacents share 
[strident]. In the unmarked case, a process which would result in an OCP violation 
fails to take place. The failure of coronal palatalization can also be attributed to 
the Elsewhere Condition (54) according to which the more speciﬁ c constraint dis-
allowing adjacent coronals which share [strident]/[sonorant] overrides the more 
general process of palatalization.
9.2.9 Labialization of [labial] and [dorsal] consonants (in SA)
Labialization involves the imposition of lip rounding and/or lip protrusion on a 
primary articulation. Labialization in San’ani diﬀ ers from palatalization in that it 
is more likely to take place in a word which has prominence within the utterance, 
whereas palatalization takes place irrespective of the prominence of the word in 
the utterance.
In San’ani, non-domain-ﬁ nal [dorsal] and [labial] consonants are realized with 
lip protrusion and lip rounding to the right of a labio-velar vocoid /u/ or /w/. [Dor-
sal] consonants are also labialized to the left of a labio-velar vowel. [Labial] under-
goers involve stronger lip rounding than [dorsal] undergoers, and the degree of lip 
protrusion and lip rounding is stronger when triggered by a stressed vowel than by 
an unstressed vowel or a glide. In addition, while the few examples of labialization 
triggered by /w/ are perserverative, /u/ triggers both perserverative and anticipa-
tory labialization of [dorsal] obstruents. Predictably, stops undergo labialization 
more readily than continuants—cf. (58c). In contrast to the other assimilation 
processes considered in this chapter, geminate velars and labials undergo stronger 
labialization than non-geminates. This is compatible with the observation that labi-
alization is more likely to take place in a word which is prominent within the utter-
ance. (84a) provides examples of labialization triggered by a preceding labio-velar 
vowel or glide, and (84b) examples of labialization triggered by a following labio-
velar vowel.

Labialization of [dorsal] obstruents occurs irrespective of whether the trigger lies 
to the left or the right of the undergoer, whereas labialization of [labial] consonants 
occurs only when the undergoer lies to the right of the trigger. I attribute this asym-
metry to the involvement of two separate processes: leftmost place feature deletion 
and right-to-left spread of the remaining place features where [dorsal] undergoers 
are involved, and left-to-right spread of non-primary [labial] where [labial] under-
goers are involved. [Dorsal] undergoers share a primary [dorsal] place with the 
trigger, violating the OCP on the [dorsal] tier (cf. Section 9.2.8). To resolve the 
OCP violation, the leftmost place features are deleted below the place node and the 
rightmost place features spread leftwards to associate with the empty place.
When the labio-velar vocoid occurs to the left of the [dorsal] obstruent, non-
 primary [labial] reassociates rightwards on deletion of the leftmost place features, 
as for the reassociation of non-primary place features in coronal (see Section 9.2.4) 
and guttural (see Section 9.2.5) place assimilation, as in (86).
In the case of [labial] undergoers, non-primary [labial] spreads rightwards from 
the trigger to a consonant with a [labial] primary place. Many languages, including 
such diverse ones as Amharic, Wantoat, and Guaraní (Ladefoged and Maddieson 
1996: 356), restrict labialization to back consonants. Other languages have a wider 
range of consonants that are either phonologically or phonetically labialized. In 
San’ani, the only labialized consonants attested are velars and labials. While the 
anticipatory and perserverative labialization of [dorsal] undergoers is motivated by 
a violation of the OCP on the [dorsal] tier, the rightward spread of non-primary 
[labial] targets consonants with a [labial] primary place—the only primary place

other than [dorsal] in the dialect which is compatible with non-primary [labial]. 
Rightward spread of non-primary [labial] is represented in (87).
9.2.10 Labialization of [dorsal] vowels
The processes considered above involve a consonant undergoer assimilating (a por-
tion of) the matrix of an adjacent consonant or vowel trigger. This section deals 
with a process attested in both dialects through which a syllabic undergoer assimi-
lates the matrix of a non-syllabic trigger, namely the realization of monomoraic 
/i/ as [u] in the environment of the labio-velar glide /w/. In Cairene, the vowel 
undergoer lies to the right of the trigger, as in: wi > wu ‘and’, wi > wu ‘mid-
dle’ (Woidich 1999: 38). In San’ani, the process targets non-ﬁ nal [dorsal] vowels 
which are tautosyllabic with the labio-velar trigger—that is, when the trigger is 
either in the onset or the coda of the syllable in which the undergoer lies. Examples 
from San’ani include the following:
(88) yidawwur ‘he looks for’ 
cf. yidarris ‘he teaches’
 
udwuh 
‘tomorrow’ 
cf. badlih 
‘suit’
 
wugif 
‘he stopped’ 
cf. nišif 
‘it m. dried up’
 
wulƒd 
‘birth [party]’ 
cf. bilƒd 
‘country, village’
 
wullƒd 
‘assisting in birth’ cf. gillƒd 
‘imitating’
 
buwwƒn 
‘becoming rich’ 
cf. xizzƒn 
‘chewing, storing’
 
yuwgaf 
‘he stops’ 
cf. yilag 
‘he catches up’
In contrast to the majority of assimilation processes discussed above, /i/ > [u] is 
triggered speciﬁ cally by the labio-velar glide /w/, and not by a set of segments. The 
failure of bimoraic [dorsal] vowels to labialize in the environment of a labio-velar 
glide is due to the strength of the potential undergoer by virtue of its length, and the 
assignment of non-primary [dorsal] to doubly-linked [dorsal] vowels at an early 
stage in the derivation (see Section 3.4.4): the constraint on adjacent dorsals only 
results in deletion of the leftmost matrix when one of the adjacents lacks a non-
primary feature (n. 21). The juxtaposition of /w/ and /i/ constitutes a violation of 
the OCP on the [dorsal] tier (cf. Sections 9.2.8 and 9.2.9) when adjacents share 
[sonorant]. Thus, the restriction on adjacent [dorsal] sonorants is similar to the 
restriction on adjacent [coronal] sonorants discussed in Section 9.2.2, but diﬀ ers 
insofar as the [dorsal] sonorant restriction is limited to the domain of the syllable.

For San’ani, this is expressed as the mirror-image process in (89); for Cairene, the 
trigger lies to the left of the undergoer (where w lies to the right of i, w will be 
linked to a mora).
As in the case of adjacent [coronal] sonorants (see Section 9.2.2), the leftmost root 
node is deleted. When the labio-velar lies to the left of the vowel, [labial] reassoci-
ates with the remaining matrix before leftward spread of the rightmost root node 
to ﬁ ll the resulting vacuum.
9.3 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I have dealt with the major prosodic and melodic post-lexical proc-
esses in Cairene and San’ani. Prosodic processes were shown to be at least par-

processes discussed were viewed in terms of consonant-to-consonant, vowel-to-
consonant and consonant-to-vowel eﬀ ects. The asymmetry of voicing assimilation 
is shown to be due to the interaction of two conﬂ icting processes. After Lombardi 
(1991, 1995, 1996), apparent anticipatory devoicing is attributed to the licensing 
of [voice] in obstruents in San’ani, and in non-sonorants in Cairene, to the left of a 
sonorant. [Voice] is delinked from an obstruent in all other environments. Delink-
ing of [voice] may be overridden, however, by right-to-left spread of [voice] from 
an adjacent voiced obstruent. In San’ani, anticipatory voicing depends on the trig-
ger and undergoer sharing the presence or absence of [cont] and is dependent, to a 
far greater extent than Cairene, on both the relative strength of the undergoer, and 
on the speed and casualness of delivery.
Local melodic processes involving place are due principally to a violation of 
the OCP on a speciﬁ c tier, or to spread of a non-primary place feature from the trig-
ger to a compatible primary feature in the undergoer. The restriction on adjacent 
identical place features, however, is not absolute in all cases, and does not result 
in the same resolution: the weaker the place feature, the greater the restriction on 
adjacents; the stronger the place feature, the more likely the occurrence of adja-
cent identicals. Thus, the restriction on adjacent gutturals is greater than that of 
adjacent coronals which in turn is greater than that of adjacent dorsals. In both 
dialects, adjacent gutturals are banned absolutely, resulting in total assimilation 
through deletion of the leftmost root node and subsequent right-to-left spread of 
the remaining root node. The restriction on adjacent coronals and dorsals, by con-
trast, depends on the identity of other features in the matrix. A violation of the 
OCP on the [dorsal] tier results in leftmost place feature deletion if and only if one 
of the adjacents lacks a non-primary place feature, and the restriction on adjacent 
coronals and dorsals results in deletion of the leftmost root node and spread of 
the rightmost root node if and only if adjacents share the root feature [sonorant]. 
In all other cases, a violation of the OCP on either the [coronal] or [dorsal] tiers 
is resolved by deletion of the leftmost place features and right-to-left spread of 
place features from the remaining matrix. Within this chapter, we have seen that 
the restriction on adjacent coronals is greater in Cairene than in San’ani, and the 
restriction on adjacent dorsals greater in San’ani than in Cairene. Further local and 
long-distance consonant-to-vowel and consonant-to-consonant eﬀ ects are exam-
ined in the next chapter, which considers spread of pharyngealization in Cairene 
and pharyngealization and labialization in San’ani.

10
EMPHASIS
The assimilation processes considered in Chapters 8 and 9 involve a consonantal 
or vocalic undergoer acquiring a portion or the whole of the feature matrix of an 
adjacent trigger. This chapter deals with the local and long-distance spread of non-
primary features from a group of segments referred to broadly as emphatic. The 
presence of a set of pharyngealized coronals attested in the Central Semitic lan-
guages and their eﬀ ect on consonants and vowels minimally within the syllable 
and, in general, maximally within the phonological word is one of the most wide-
ly recognized features of Arabic phonology. Traditionally, these consonants are 
referred to as emphatics and are held to be distinguished from a set of plain coun-
terparts by the presence of a feature described loosely as phonological emphasis. 
In Chapter 3, however, I show that the set of emphatics is not restricted to the 
 pharyngealized coronals. It also includes the uvulars (including the uvular frica-
tives and the uvular stop in dialects for which these sounds are attested phonologic-
ally) and the pharyngeals. These are analysed as the emphatic counterparts of the 
velars and the laryngeals respectively.
The analysis of all the pharyngeal and pharyngealized phonemes as emphatic 
is not new, but follows that of Jakobson (1957), Garbell (1958), and McOmber 
(1996). The analysis also bears similarities with Broselow (1976), for whom the 
pharyngeal and pharyngealized sounds share the feature [+constricted pharynx], 
although the pharyngeals are not described as emphatic as such. The phonologic-
al analysis is supported by Laufer and Baer’s (1988) phonetic study of the oral 
emphatic and pharyngeal sounds in Hebrew and Arabic, in which they conducted 
300 minutes of video recordings from nine Hebrew and Arabic speakers using a 
ﬁ berscope in the upper pharynx and simultaneous audio recordings. Their analysis 
of the audio-visual recordings showed that all the emphatic and pharyngeal sounds 
studied were made with qualitively the same pharyngeal constriction, but that the 
pharyngeal constriction was more extreme and less variable in the pharyngeals 
than in the oral emphatics.
In this chapter, I begin by considering the articulatory and acoustic correlates 
of phonological emphasis. I then consider the phonetic eﬀ ect of spread on vocalic 
undergoers from pharyngeals and pharyngealized oral consonants. In Section 10.4, 
I examine the domain of emphasis in Cairene, the directionality of spread of pha-
ryngealization, and the phenomenon of guttural oﬀ -glides in the environment 
of the pharyngeals. In Section 10.5, I examine emphasis in San’ani, a dialect 
for which emphasis in the pharyngealized coronals has two phonological expo-
nents—pharyngealization and labialization. In this section, I consider the domain 

10.1 the articulatory correlates of emphasis

of emphasis and account for asymmetry in the directionality of spread of pharyn-
gealization, on the one hand, and labialization, on the other.
10.1 THE ARTICULATORY CORRELATES OF EMPHASIS
The Arab grammarians considered emphasis to be a feature inherent in certain oral 
consonants which rendered them distinct from their plain counterparts. According 
to the eighth-century Arab grammarian, Sibawayh, emphasis involved raising the 
tongue dorsum towards al-anak al-a  clƒ ‘the upper palate’ (Sibawayh 1982: 436), 
a place said to lie between the points of articulation for /k/ and // (Giannini and 
Pettorino 1982). Western accounts initially described emphasis in the oral emphat-
ics as velarization—the raising of the pharyngeal dorsum towards the soft palate 
(Nasr 1959a; Obrecht 1968). Later work by Al-Ani (1970), Ghazeli (1977), Dolgo-
polsky (1977), and others (e.g. Broselow 1976; Card 1983; McCarthy 1986, 1994; 
Jarrah 1993) based on the results of laboratory analysis demonstrates that the soft 
palate is not involved in the production of emphasis, but rather that the oral emphat-
ics are marked by constriction in the upper pharynx. In recent work, emphasis in 
the oral emphatics is either described as pharyngealization (due to the presence 
of general pharyngeal constriction) (Dickins 1990; Watson 1999d), or as uvular-
ization (due to upper pharyngeal constriction in the oral emphatics similar to the 
constriction found in the uvular fricatives) (Dolgopolsky 1977; McCarthy 1994; 
Shahin 1997, 1998; Zawaydeh 1998).1 In this model, emphasis is described as pha-
ryngealization and represented by non-primary [guttural] (see Sections 3.4.7–10), 
a feature which encompasses the degrees of pharyngeal constriction attested in all 
the emphatic sub-sets.
Although described phonologically as pharyngealization, emphasis does not 
involve a single articulatory feature; rather, a number of phonetic phenomena com-
bine to create the auditory impression of ‘darkening’ (Harrell 1957: 69; Lehn 1963: 
30–1 for Cairene). In a number of modern Arabic dialects, pharyngealization in 
the pharyngeals is enhanced by labialization and in the pharyngealized oral conso-
nants by labialization and lateral spreading and concavity of the tongue. Of these, 
lip-protrusion or lip-rounding is the most obvious and certainly the most visually 
salient enhancing feature of the emphatic phonemes. It is also not conﬁ ned to mod-
ern dialects of Arabic: in the rendering of religious texts in Standard Arabic, oral 
emphatic consonants have very pronounced lip-rounding (Holes 1995: 56). In a 
number of modern Arabic dialects, the non-ﬁ nal perfect and the imperfect stem 
vowel is realized as either a or u, but never as i, when one of the root consonants 
is an oral emphatic. This is exempliﬁ ed in Lebanese ruxi ‘it m. became cheap’ 
1 Laufer and Baer’s (1988) analysis of 300 minutes of audio-visual recordings, however, contradicts 
the uvularization hypothesis of Ghazeli (1977) and others, showing that constriction for both pharyn-
geals and pharyngealized orals is in the lower pharynx with the narrowest constriction between the 
epiglottis and the pharyngeal wall.

270
(Haddad 1983, cited in Kenstowicz 1994: 42) and the Yemeni dialect of Baraddun 
yigu ‘he cuts’ (Bettini 1985: 121). In a few Arabic dialects, including San’ani 
and Iraqi, labialization is not restricted to the emphatic phoneme or to vowels in 
verb stems, but spreads throughout the phonological word. In Cairene, as in most 
other modern Arabic dialects, the slight lip protrusion or lip rounding apparent 
in the oral emphatics (Lehn and Abboud 1965: 271) is restricted to the emphatic 
phoneme itself (Harrell 1957: 69–70).
10.2 THE ACOUSTIC CORRELATES OF EMPHASIS
Combined with the primary feature, the articulatory features of emphasis in the 
oral emphatics enlarge the oral cavity and decrease the volume of the pharyngeal 
cavity. It is this large, semi-contained oral cavity which endows the emphatic 
consonant and surrounding sounds with the auditory impression of ‘darkness’ or 
‘heaviness’.2 The oral emphatics are typically marked by a compact acoustic spec-
trum through lowering of the upper frequency formants (principally F2) due to 
an enlarged mouth cavity, and raising of F1 due to a reduced pharyngeal cavity. 
Through lacking a primary constriction within the oral tract, the lowering of F2 is 
less marked in the pharyngeals (cf. Hoberman 1985: 223).3
Recent experimental studies show the most signiﬁ cant acoustic correlate of 
emphasis in the oral emphatics to be F2 lowering. This suggests that the most sig-
niﬁ cant articulatory correlate of emphasis is enlargement of the oral cavity. As for 
any cavity, the oral cavity may be enlarged at either extremity of the tract. Like-
wise, the acoustic eﬀ ects of enlargement at one end of a tract tend to be enhanced 
by enlargement at the opposite end (cf. Stevens and Keyser 1989). Enlargement of 
the tract at the pharynx may be enhanced by enlargement of the tract at the lips 
through lip protrusion or rounding, just as enlargement of the tract at the lips in 
labial segments tends to be enhanced by enlargement at the pharynx. Since labi-
alization has the acoustic eﬀ ect of lowering F1, while pharyngealization has the 
eﬀ ect of raising F1, the fact that labialization is an enhancing feature, particularly 
in the oral emphatics, is further evidence that F2 lowering is more signiﬁ cant than 
F1 raising in the identiﬁ cation of emphasis.
10.3 [GUTTURAL] SPREAD
In Chapter 3 and above, I argue that the set of emphatics includes both the oral 
emphatics and the pharyngeals  and c and that emphasis is represented by non-
2 The Arab grammarians typically refer to the pharyngeals and pharyngealized consonants as 
mufaxxam ‘intensiﬁ ed’ or ‘honoured’ (Harrell 1957: 80).
3 According to Laufer and Baer (1988), however, F2 lowering is a signiﬁ cant factor in both the 
pharyngeals and the pharyngealized oral consonants.

10.3  [guttural] spread
271
primary [guttural]. However, [guttural] spread from the pharyngeals does not 
have an identical phonetic eﬀ ect to [guttural] spread from the oral emphatics; also, 
while [guttural] spreads long distance from the coronal emphatics and targets both 
vowels and consonants, [guttural] spread from the pharyngeals is restricted to 
adjacent vowels.
The diﬀ erence in realization of [guttural] spread from each of the emphatic sub-
sets is not, however, reason to avoid describing the pharyngeals as the emphatic 
counterparts of the laryngeals. In this section, I claim that both the domain of 
spread and the phonetic realization of [guttural] spread is predictable from the 
combinatorial feature speciﬁ cation of the trigger. I conjecture that the more con-
tingent the phonetic realization of the non-primary feature on the primary feature, 
the further the non-primary feature will spread and the less speciﬁ c the targets of 
spread will be. In palatalization processes, spread of non-primary [dorsal] from a 
palatal vocoid is local and typically targets [coronal] and [dorsal] plosives speciﬁ c-
ally, due to the fact that the phonetic realization of non-primary [dorsal] is inde-
pendent of the other features of the segment. Similarly, non-primary [guttural] in 
a pharyngeal is not moderated by other place or stricture features of the segment 
and therefore spread of non-primary [guttural] from a pharyngeal trigger is local, 
targeting adjacent short vowels, and in Cairene targeting adjacent long [guttural] 
vowels and the immediately adjacent mora of long [dorsal] vowels optionally.
In the case of the coronal emphatics, on the other hand, the phonetic realiza-
tion of non-primary [guttural] is highly contingent on the primary [coronal] fea-
ture: primary [coronal] adds tension to the tongue dorsum and restricts pharyngeal 
constriction to the upper pharynx, while non-primary [guttural] serves to retract 
the tongue blade from the top of the incisors towards the alveolar ridge (Ali and 
Daniloﬀ  1974; McOmber 1996: 251–2; Zemánek 1996: 4). This feature combi-
nation aﬀ ects both the domain of spread and the realization of emphasis spread. 
While spread of non-primary [guttural] from a pharyngeal typically results in a 
lowered realization of adjacent short vowels and long [guttural] vowels, spread 
from an oral emphatic results in a lowered, centralized realization of [dorsal] 
 vowels and a lowered, retracted realization of [guttural] vowels. This is demon-
strated in the following examples from Cairene. Before a syllable-ﬁ nal pharyngeal, 
/i/ is lowered to [ε] (examples in (1)–(5) from Woidich 1999: 27–8).

X-ray conﬁ gurations of pharyngealized coronals in the environment of both [gut-
tural] and [dorsal] vowels show that the tongue blade is raised towards the alveolar 
ridge, the palatine dorsum is depressed and the pharyngeal dorsum is retracted 
before, during and after the production of the emphatic. These combined phonetic 
eﬀ ects result in the lowered and centralized realization of [dorsal] vowels. The 
lowered, retracted realization of [guttural] vowels in the environment of pharyn-
gealized coronals is also attributable to these phonetic eﬀ ects: retraction of the 
pharyngeal dorsum, depression of the palatine dorsum and raising of the tongue 
blade with slight enhancing labialization increases the volume of the vocal tract 
and acoustically serves to further lower F2. I conjecture that the similar realization 
of vowels in the environment of the uvular stop in Cairene is due to the combined 
phonetic eﬀ ect of the dorsum raising of primary [dorsal] and the dorsum retraction 
of non-primary [guttural] together with perceptible enhancing lip protrusion and 
rounding. The resonance note of the oral and pharyngeal cavities depends not only 
on the position of the tongue but also on the degree of closure at the jaws and the 
lips (Delattre 1971: 133). In the case of spread from the pharyngeals, the tongue 
blade and palatine dorsum play no role in the spread process, hence the degree 

10.4  the domain of emphasis spread
273
of tension in the dorsum is less, and spread of non-primary [guttural] simply low-
ers the adjacent vowel. Acoustically, vowels in the environment of pharyngeals 
are realized with less F2 lowering due, partly, to the fact that labialization in the 
pharyngeals is less apparent than in the oral emphatics.
10.4 THE DOMAIN OF EMPHASIS SPREAD
In both Cairene and San’ani, the extent of emphasis spread is greatest from the pha-
ryngealized coronals and least from the pharyngeals. In these dialects, emphasis 
spread from the pharyngealized coronals may encompass the whole phonological 
word, as in (6) and (25), or spread beyond the word boundary, as in (11) and (26), 
though it may be blocked by non-tautosyllabic [dorsal] vocoids (/y/ or /i/) to the 
right of the emphatic, and may fail to spread into preﬁ xes and suﬃ  xes (Broselow 
1976: 46; Woidich 1999: 45 for Cairene). In Cairene, emphasis spread from the 
uvular /q/ targets adjacent vowels only. In the case of the pharyngeals, emphasis 
targets adjacent short vowels, optionally targets long [guttural] vowels, and in 
Cairene optionally targets the adjacent portion of the adjacent mora of long [dor-
sal] vowels. The diﬀ erence in the extent of spread from the diﬀ erent sub-classes 
of pharyngealized consonants I take again to be a direct reﬂ ection of the contin-
gency relationship between the primary and non-primary feature—the stronger the 
relationship between a primary and a non-primary feature, the longer the muscle 
relaxation time, the longer the dorsum and vocal tract take to return to a neutral 
position, and hence the further pharyngealization will spread within the word. In 
the articulation of pharyngealized coronals, both the corona and the dorsum are 
involved at opposite diagonals of the vocal tract. The tongue is thus stretched 
in two directions. In the articulation of the uvular stop, the dorsum is retracted 
towards the uvula. In the articulation of the pharyngeals, the tongue root is retract-
ed to narrow the pharynx on the front–back dimension (Laufer and Baer 1988: 
163), but neither the dorsum nor the corona is actively involved. Thus the tongue 
is in a lesser state of tension than for either the pharyngealized coronals or the 
uvulars. In this section, I examine the domain of [guttural] spread in Cairene, con-
sidering ﬁ rst spread from the pharyngealized coronals, and then spread from the 
pharyngeals. In Section 10.5, I examine the domain and directionality of emphasis 
spread in San’ani, considering ﬁ rst the spread of [guttural] and then of [labial] 
from the pharyngealized coronals.
10.4.1 Emphasis spread from the primary coronal emphatics in Cairene
From any of the primary coronal emphatics /, , , z/ in Cairene, [guttural] spreads 
bidirectionally within the stem of the phonological word. The minimum domain of 
spread is CV (Broselow 1976: 32) and the maximum domain the entire phonologic-
al word. In the following sets of examples, the underlying emphatic is represented 
by a subscript dot while targets of emphasis are represented by underlining.

Leftwards 
Bidirectional
 
ubyƒn ‘boys’ 
raba ‘he bound’ 
baala ‘onion’
 
iyƒm ‘fasting’ 
mara ‘illness’ 
xaar ‘to make green’
 
arab ‘he hit’ 
abya ‘white’ 
waa 
‘by God!’
Emphasis spread is optionally blocked by non-tautosyllabic [dorsal] vocoids to the 
right of the underlying emphatic. Examples include:
 (7) 
maƒyib ~ maƒyib ‘misfortunes’ 
cf. ma¤ba ‘misfortune’
 
ayyib ~ ayyib 
‘good’ 
cf. iyƒm ‘fasting’
 
ƒib 
‘my friend m.’ 
cf. aƒb ‘friends m.’
 
caaf¤r 
‘small birds’ 
cf. caf¶r 
‘small bird’
 
faya 
‘empty f.s.’
Emphasis may also be blocked by non-tautosyllabic /u/ in suﬃ  xes:
 (8) abu ‘his friend m.’ cf. aƒb ‘friends’
However, emphasis fails to be blocked by a tautosyllabic [dorsal] vowel. The ex-
amples above contrast with the following:
 (9) ¤n 
‘mud’ 
iﬂ  
‘child’
 
tax¤r ‘making green’ 
yi¤ ‘he shouts’
In contrast to rightward spread, leftward spread from a primary emphatic fails to 
be blocked by [dorsal] vocoids within the stem:
(10) 
maƒﬁ z ‘wallets’ 
ʔam¤ ‘shirt’
 
wiil 
‘he arrived’
The domain of emphasis is also aﬀ ected by the structure of adjacent words. Where 
the word preceding a word with an underlying emphatic ends in a stop, this stop 
and in some cases its preceding vowel may be realized with emphasis, see (11a). 
In phrases invoking the name of God, emphasis also targets larger groups of seg-
ments in the preceding word, as in (11b). Similarly, the leftmost consonant of a 
 following word is emphasized when this sequence is syllabiﬁ ed with the preceding 
word, see (11c).
(11) (a) liban daka ‘Frankincense resin’ 
walad aw¤l ‘a tall boy’
 
(b) in šƒ ʔaƒ 
‘God willing’ 
ma šƒ ʔaƒ ‘fantastic!’
 
(c) il-ʔ¥a kb¤ra ‘the room is large’ 
dakata kt¤r ‘a lot of doctors’
The -l of the deﬁ nite article, phonologically part of the preceding word (see Sec-
tion 9.1.2.3), is optionally realized as emphatic together with its preceding vowel 
when it deﬁ nes a word with an emphatic coronal:
(12) 
il-mara ~ il-mara ‘the illness’
When -l of the article assimilates to an emphatic coronal, the assimilated segment 

10.4  the domain of emphasis spread

is realized as emphatic irrespective of whether the consonant to which it assimi-
lates is a primary emphatic or emphatic by virtue of emphasis spread:
(13) 
i-¤n 
‘the mud’ 
i-ub ‘the morning’
 
i-ƒgil ‘the man’ 
ig-gƒ ‘the neighbour’
The preﬁ xes it-, in-, mi- and yi- usually remain unaﬀ ected by emphasis spread as 
does the {third person feminine singular} subject suﬃ  x -it and the homophonous 
allomorph of the nominal {feminine singular} suﬃ  x. The example šaniti ‘my bag’ 
shows that {feminine singular} may be unaﬀ ected by emphasis spread even when 
the vowel of the morpheme is tautosyllabic with the underlying emphatic.
(14) 
minƒb ‘hit’ 
maarit ‘it rained’
 
ubitik ‘your f.s. absence’ yitribi 
‘it m. is bound/tied up’

‘my bag’
 
10.4.2 Emphasis spread from the secondary emphatics
The secondary emphatics /, , m / and /b/ exhibit a limited number of oppositions 
with their non-emphatic counterparts. Oppositions include:
(15) gƒi 
‘my neighbour’ 
gƒri 
‘running’
 
baʔai ‘my cows’ 
baʔari ‘beef adj.’
 
ƒgil 
‘man’ 
rƒgi c 
‘returning’
 
ƒʔid 
‘major’ 
rƒʔid 
‘lying’
 
bƒba 
‘Daddy’ 
 
waa 
‘by God’ 
walla 
‘or’
 
m ayyiti ‘my water’ 
mayyiti ‘my deceased’
In contrast to the four primary emphatics, emphasis spread from the secondary 
emphatics is usually restricted to consonants and [guttural] vowels within the 
phonological word. Since /b/, //, and /m / are extremely marginal and exhibit very 
few minimal contrasts with non-emphatic counterparts, I restrict my statements 
here to //.
Emphasis spread from an // trigger is blocked by a [dorsal] vocoid to the right 
or left of the emphatic. This is exempliﬁ ed below:
(16) Left 
 
Right
 
diƒsa ‘learning’ 
amya ‘ash’
 
inﬁ gƒ ‘explosion’ 
umƒdi ‘grey’
 
sifƒa ‘embassy’ 
ƒgil 
‘man’
Where // comes in direct contact with a [dorsal] vocoid, not only is emphasis 
spread blocked, but the underlying emphatic is itself de-emphasized. The right-
most column in (17a) gives examples with the [dorsal] vocoid to the left, that in 
(17b) examples of the [dorsal] vocoid to the right of the emphatic:
bƒba 
[Coptic month]

(17) (a) sƒ 
‘he went’ 
cf. sƒyir ‘going’
 
 
xadda ‘he stupeﬁ ed’ 
cf. taxd¤r ‘stupefying’
 
 
akba ‘older’ 
cf. kab¤r ‘old’
 
 
sifƒa ‘embassy’ 
cf. saf¤r ‘ambassador’
 
 
t¥ 
‘bull’ 
cf. tirƒn ‘bulls’
 
(b) tigƒa ‘trade’ 
cf. tigƒri ‘trade adj.’
 
 
ʔidƒa ‘administration’ 
cf. ʔidƒri ‘administrative’
 
 
faʔ 
‘poverty’ 
cf. faʔri ‘poor adj.’
Where the {ﬁ rst person singular} possessive pronoun -i is suﬃ  xed, however, // 
is not de-emphasized. Thus gƒi ‘my neighbour’ and baʔai ‘my cows’ contrast 
with gƒri ‘running’ and baʔari ‘beef adj.’. I conjecture that de-emphasization of 
// is a process which is determined early in the derivation. /i/ in gƒri ‘running’ is 
part of the word stem; /i/ in baʔari ‘beef’ is the relational or nisba ending (see Sec-
tion 7.2); /i/ in baʔai ‘my cows’ is the {ﬁ rst person singular} possessive pronoun 
suﬃ  x. As we have seen in Chapter 7, /i/ of the relational suﬃ  x is ordered one in the 
nominal level-two morphology, whereas the homophonous {ﬁ rst person singular} 
possessive pronoun suﬃ  x is ordered ﬁ ve (see Section 7.2; Table 7.2). I assume 
that de-emphasization of // takes place prior to aﬃ  xation of possessive pronoun 
suﬃ  xes. Where de-emphasization fails to take place at this stage, emphatic // sur-
vives to the surface. In contrast to de-emphasization of //, spread of emphasis from 
// is determined purely by the phonological environment.
10.4.3 Analysis
In Cairene, leftward spread from an underlying primary emphatic is unbounded 
within the stem, whereas rightward spread may be blocked by [dorsal] vocoids. 
I assume that in Cairene non-primary [dorsal] is assigned by default to [dorsal] 
vocoids prior to the spread of emphasis. [Dorsal] vocoids block the spread of 
emphasis because the pharyngeal expansion characteristic of non-primary [dorsal] 
(see Section 3.4.4) is incompatible with the pharyngeal constriction of pharyngeal-
ization (see Section 3.4.5). This is expressed as the negative constraint in (18).
This negative constraint usually fails to prevent [guttural] spread under two condi-
tions: ﬁ rstly in right-to-left spread, and, secondly, where the [dorsal] vocoid is 
tautosyllabic with the emphatic trigger. This latter is the case for both the pharyn-
gealized orals and the pharyngeals (cf. (1) and (2)). Assimilation processes are 
more likely to take place in a small domain than in a large domain (see Section 
8.2). Thus, emphasis will tend to spread to a [dorsal] vocoid which falls in the

277
same syllable as the emphatic trigger, but will be blocked by a non-tautosyllabic 
[dorsal] vocoid. The failure of the constraint to hold in right-to-left spread, on the 
other hand, is due to an asymmetry in timing between the primary and non-primary 
articulation where secondary articulations are involved (cf. Ladefoged and Mad-
dieson 1996: 357): in pharyngealization, the pharynx narrows prior to the hold 
phase of the primary articulation. Pharyngealization is thus anchored more on the 
onset of the primary articulation, resulting in the typical anticipatory nature of pha-
ryngealization spread. In the unmarked direction of spread, pharyngeal constric-
tion overrides the segmental requirement of pharyngeal expansion in the [dorsal] 
vocoid. In the marked direction of spread, however, the segmental requirements of 
the [dorsal] vocoid override the cross-segmental requirement of emphasis spread.
The de-emphasization of // in the immediate environment of a [dorsal] vocoid 
is due to the pharyngeal expansion of palatalization overriding the pharyngeal 
constriction of the adjacent secondary emphatic. De-emphasization may also take 
place when the primary emphatics are involved. In Chapter 9, we saw that a fol-
lowing palatal vocoid may palatalize a pharyngealized coronal stop optionally in 
Cairene (see Section 9.2.8). Palatalization in this case is often accompanied by 
de-emphasization, expressed as non-primary [dorsal] overriding non-primary [gut-
tural] of the primary emphatic. Palatalization and de-emphasization of // is dia-
grammed in (19).
In marked cases, the [guttural] feature of the emphatic may remain on spread of 
[dorsal], ensuring that in certain environments the requirements of the segment are 
10.4.4 Spread from the pharyngeals and the guttural off-glide
In contrast to [guttural] spread from a pharyngealized coronal, spread from a pha-
ryngeal is restricted to adjacent [guttural] vowels and tautosyllabic short [dorsal] 
vowels. In each case, spread results in lowering of the vowel. In the case of spread 
to a palatal vowel, I assume that the spreading [guttural] feature overrides non-pri-
mary [dorsal] in the target (cf. above). Examples are repeated for convenience from 
(1), (2), and (4) above. (20a) provides examples of spread to short [dorsal] vowels, 
and (20b) examples of spread to short and, optionally, to long [guttural] vowels.

The long [dorsal] vowels /e:/, /o:/, /i:/ and /u:/, by contrast, are not lowered in 
the immediate environment of the pharyngeals, but are usually accompanied by a 
regressive (21a) or anticipatory (21b) lowered oﬀ -glide (Harrell 1957: 46–8).

The guttural oﬀ -glide in Cairene shares similarities with the well-documented Bib-
lical Hebrew Guttural Lowering described by McCarthy (1994: 211–12).4 In Tibe-
rian Hebrew, Guttural Lowering aﬀ ects any vowel before a tautosyllabic root-ﬁ nal 
guttural. Where the vowel aﬀ ected is short, the entire vowel is lowered; where the 
vowel aﬀ ected is long, only the rightmost mora of the vowel is lowered.

In Biblical Hebrew, [guttural] links to the rightmost mora of the stem from the gut-
tural consonant and is accompanied by de-linking of features from that mora:
In Cairene, lowering is a mirror-image process which aﬀ ects the adjacent portion 
of the adjacent mora rather than the entire mora. I suggest that primary and non-
primary [guttural] link from the pharyngeal to the adjacent mora of a [dorsal]

10.5 ENHANCING FEATURES AND EMPHASIS SPREAD 
IN SAN’ANI
The principal acoustic eﬀ ects of pharyngealization may be enhanced by enlarge-
ment of the vocal tract at the lips. In this section, I show that enhancing features 
may be promoted to compensating features where the enhanced feature, in this 
case [guttural], is weakened perceptually.
Studies have shown that the domain of emphasis is not constant cross-dialectal-
ly. In Abha Arabic (spoken in south-west Saudi Arabia), emphasis rarely spreads 
beyond the adjacent vowel (Younes 1991); in Qatari, emphasis spreads bi-direc-
tionally over the whole word, and where the emphatic is the leftmost segment of 
a word, may also spread leftward across the word boundary (Bukshaisha 1985: 
217–19); in dialects of Palestinian, emphasis spreads bi-directionally within the 
phonological word, but while leftward spread is generally unbounded, rightward 
spread is blocked by a set of opaque segments (Herzallah 1990; Davis 1995); 
in Cairene, emphasis may spread throughout the whole phonological word, may 
spread leftward across a word boundary, but may be blocked by palatal vocoids, 
particularly in suﬃ  xes, and may also fail to spread into preﬁ xes.
These observations indicate that in phonetic terms emphasis is relative and gra-
dient rather than an absolute phenomenon (cf. Harrell 1957: 80), and that emphatic 
phonemes in some dialects of Arabic may be phonetically more pharyngealized 
than in others. Indeed, in many dialects one emphatic consonant in a series (usu-
ally the pharyngealized coronal sibilant) tends to be marked by less pharyngeal 
constriction than the others (Lehn 1963 for Cairene; Ghazeli 1977: 72 for Tunis-
ian; J. Dickins p.c. for Central Sudanese). Some dialects of Sudanese have lost 
emphatic // altogether (J. Dickins p.c.), and in San’ani a number of roots with 
emphatic // in Standard Arabic have been reanalysed with plain /s/ or /z/. These 
include /b-s-r/ < */b--r/ ‘see’ and /z--r/ < */--r/ ‘small’. It is therefore not sur-
prising that the degree of pharyngeal constriction in the San’ani oral emphatics dif-
fers from, and is less than, that in the Cairene oral emphatics.
Unless the oral emphatics are gradually to merge with their plain counterparts, 
as indeed has occurred in Maltese and several peripheral dialects of Arabic—

including Chadian and Cypriot Maronite (Kaye 1976: 50)—weakening of the pha-
ryngeal element will be compensated for by strengthening of one of the enhancing 
features. The most obvious of these is labialization, since this involves expansion 
at the opposite end of the vocal tract. This is precisely the case in San’ani where 
labialization has come to compensate for the relatively small degree of pharyngeal 
constriction in the oral emphatics and spreads from the emphatic phoneme to other 
segments within the phonological word. As a result, emphasis in San’ani has two 
phonological exponents—pharyngealization and labialization. Acoustically, labi-
alization lowers both F2 and F1, while pharyngealization lowers F2 but raises F1 
(see Section 10.2); therefore the requirement of a compact acoustic spectrum for 
the oral emphatics appears to be of less perceptual importance in San’ani than in 
Cairene. In this section, I consider the domain and directionality of spread of pha-
ryngealization and then of labialization from the coronal emphatics.
In San’ani, pharyngealization spreads from right to left within the stem of the 
phonological word:
(25) xƒ 
‘special’ 
mista¤l ‘long, elongated’
 
bƒ 
‘bus’ 
faga 
‘only’
 
manƒug ‘areas, regions’ 
mara	 
‘illness’
 
tsƒga 
‘it m. falls out’
When a word ending in a plosive is followed immediately by a pharyngealized cor-
onal, or where a plosive falls in the same syllable as a pharyngealized coronal in 
the following phonological word, this consonant may also be pharyngealized:
(26) 
ciddat urug 
‘a number of ways’ 
ﬁ rzat a  cduh ‘the Sa’da taxi rank’
 
awgƒt a	-	uhr ‘around midday’
As in Cairene, pharyngealization spreads into the preceding word in phrases invok-
ing God, but does not spread beyond the immediately adjacent word (cf. (11b)).
(27) 
in šƒ ʔaƒh ‘God willing’ mƒ šƒ ʔaƒh ‘fantastic!’
Pharyngealization usually fails to spread into preﬁ xes and clitics, even where these 
are tautosyllabic with the emphatic:
(28) 
b¤-rabba 
‘he is tying’ 
mƒ 	arabš ‘he didn’t hit’
 
yila  c 
‘he goes up’ 
yiull 
‘he/it m. looks out onto’
 
bi-tna		am ‘she arranges’ 
bayn-ala  c ‘I am going up’
Within the stem of the phonological word, pharyngealization also spreads from 
left to right—see (29a)—but may be blocked by non-tautosyllabic /i:/, and fails 
to spread into suﬃ  xes unless they are immediately adjacent to the emphatic trig-
ger—see (29b).

While pharyngealization spreads predominantly from right to left within the stem 
of the phonological word, labialization spreads predominantly from left to right. 
Labialization manifests itself phonologically in the labialization of monomoraic 
[dorsal] vowels such that /i/ is realized in the environment of a pharyngealized 
coronal as [u]:

Unlike pharyngealization, labialization is not restricted to the word stem. It also 
targets all monomoraic [dorsal] vowels in suﬃ  xes (31a) and enclitics (31b):

In emphasis spread in San’ani, the erstwhile enhancing feature [labial] has adopted 
the role of compensatory feature with the result that non-primary [labial] is now 
more active in signalling emphasis spread than non-primary [guttural]. Thus, in 
contrast to Cairene, in San’ani, [labial] has attained the status of a phonological 
feature in the representation of the pharyngealized coronals in San’ani. The repre-
sentation of pharyngealized coronals given in Section 3.4.7 is revised in (32) for 
San’ani to include non-primary [labial].

[Labial] spread targets monomoraic [dorsal] vowels only. Since the only [labial] 
vowel phoneme in the language is also [dorsal], [labial] spread can be said to be 
subject to the following positive condition:
10.5.1 [Labial] spread and transparent segments
[Labial] targets all monomoraic [dorsal] vowels within the phonological word to 
the right of the trigger, irrespective of the identity of the intervening segments. 
Thus, in contrast to pharyngealization, which is blocked by dorsal vocoids to 
the right of the emphatic in several dialects of Arabic (see Sections 10.4 and 
10.5, Herzallah 1990, and Davis 1995 for Palestinian dialects), labialization has 
no opaque segments: all segments other than monomoraic /i/ are transparent to 
[la bial] spread. This includes vowels which are already speciﬁ ed for [labial]—as is 
the case in the word mag¶bih ‘diligent f.s.’, realized as mag¶buh, where [labial] 
targets the ﬁ nal monomoraic [dorsal] vowel, bypassing /u:/:
The transparency of /i:/ to [labial] spread is due to the relative strength of the seg-
ment: stronger segments are more resistant to assimilation than weaker segments 
(see Section 8.2; Mohanan 1993: 91), and one coordinate of segment strength is 
increase in duration (see Section 9.2.6; Mohanan 1993: 103). We have already seen 
two examples of longer segments resisting assimilatory processes which their short 
counterparts are subject to: in San’ani, intervocalic voicing aﬀ ects single obstruents, 
but not geminate obstruents; and in Cairene, a geminate /tt/ is a third less likely to 
palatalize in a palatalizing environment than its short counterpart (cf. Haeri 1997: 
54). Part of the reason that long vowels are less subject to assimilation than their 
short counterparts is the relative tenseness of the vowel: the longer the vowel, the 
tenser it will be (Mohanan 1993: 105). Thus, although some [labial] protrusion is 
apparent on /i:/ in words such as aw¤luh ‘long f.s.’, [labial] spread is simply a pho-

netic process which fails to change the position of the vowel on the front–back axis. 
I assume that, phonologically, non-primary [dorsal] is assigned to [dorsal] vowels 
linked to two moras (see Section 3.4.4), whereas monomoraic [dorsal] vowels in 
San’ani are underspeciﬁ ed for the non-primary feature at the stage at which non-
primary [labial] spreads from an underlying pharyngealized coronal.
The [guttural] vowel /a/ is also transparent to spread in non-ﬁ nal position, as 
illustrated in ƒyum ‘fasting m.s.’, aƒbuh ‘his friends’, maraguh ‘hammer’, and 
aw¤luh ‘long f.s.’. In pre-pausal position, however, /a:/ is realized as [o:] to the 
right of an emphatic, as in allayn¥ ‘we prayed’ and 	arabn¥ ‘we hit’. This is 
attributed to the fact that /a:/ is subject to raising in pre-pausal position5 and real-
ized in non-emphatic environments as [e:], as in: /ʔabsar + nƒ/ > ʔabsarn¢ ‘we 
saw’ and /garray + nƒ/ > garrayn¢ ‘we taught’. The pre-pausal raising of /a/ is a 
feature recognized by the Arab grammarians and attested in a number of modern 
Arabic dialects including several Egyptian dialects (though not modern Cairene) 
and dialects spoken in the Levant. I interpret pre-pausal raising as the appendage 
of non-primary [dorsal] to a [guttural] vowel, as in (35).
The presence of [dorsal] creates the phonological environment for [labial] spread 
in case the phrase-ﬁ nal vowel is preceded in the phonological word by a pharyn-
gealized coronal:

10.5.2 The directionality of [labial] spread
Leftward spread of [labial] is far more restricted than rightward spread. To the left 
of a pharyngealized coronal, [dorsal] vowels are realized as [u] within the stem in 
lexicalized forms:
(37) 
mulgƒ 
‘tongs’ 
cf. 
miftƒ ‘key’
 
ƒmu	uh ‘soured fenugreek’ cf. 
kƒtibih ‘writer f.’
 
nu 
‘half’ 
cf. Standard nif
 
fu		uh 
‘silver’ 
cf. Standard ﬁ 		ah
To the immediate left of a pharyngealized coronal, [dorsal] vowels are usually real-
ized as [u] in derived stems:
(38) 
alaxbu 
‘I get mixed up’ 
cf. agambir ‘I sit’
 
barƒgu 
‘lumps’ 
cf. barƒkis ‘bundles’
 
tiammu	 
‘she closes (eyes)’ 
cf. tidarris 
‘she teaches’
 
yilaggu ~ yilaggi ‘he picks up’
 
yilƒu	 ~ yilƒi	 ‘he observes’
[Labial] spread into the imperfect preﬁ x vowel is common where vowel-ﬁ nal 
stems are involved (Watson 1995b, 1999a: 296), but is otherwise rare even where 
the emphatic is tautosyllabic with the [dorsal] vowel. The examples in (39a) com-
pare with those in (39b).
(39) (a) yu	w¤ 
‘he goes home’ cf. yibn¤ 
‘he builds’
 
 
yuf¤ 
‘he cleans’ 
cf. yiml¤ 
‘he ﬁ lls’
 
 
yuxƒ ~ yixƒ ‘he walks’ 
cf. yidrƒ 
‘he knows’
 
 
yuaff¤ 
‘he cleans’ 
cf. yimall¤ 
‘he ﬁ lls’
 
 
yualf¤ 
‘he cleans’ 
cf. yisaww¤ ‘he does/makes’
 
(b) yila  c 
‘he goes up’ 
 
yi	rub 
‘he hits’
 
 
yiambul 
‘he drums’ 
 
yiull 
‘he/it m. looks out on’
Thus, we have a situation in which left-to-right spread of [labial] is exceptionless, 
whereas right-to-left spread is restricted and optional even when the potential 
undergoer is tautosyllabic with or otherwise immediately adjacent to the trigger. 
As for the directionality of pharyngealization, so the directionality of labialization 
is attributable to an asymmetry in timing between the primary and non-primary 
articulation. In contrast to pharyngealization where the pharynx narrows prior to 
the hold phase of the primary articulation, protrusion of the lips in labialization 
tends to occur on or after the hold phase of the primary articulation (Ladefoged 
and Maddieson 1996: 357–8). As a result, the second formant of a vowel follow-
ing a labialized consonant is lower than the second formant of a vowel preceding a 
labialized consonant resulting in the typical perseverative nature of [labial] spread. 
Therefore, while the unmarked direction of [guttural] spread is right to left, the 
unmarked direction of [labial] spread is left to right.

10.5 enhancing features and emphasis spread
285
10.5.3 The pharyngeals
The pharyngeals in San’ani are articulated with a small degree of labial protru-
sion.6 In contrast to the coronal emphatics, however, labial protrusion in the pha-
ryngeals is simply a phonetic enhancing feature, and does not spread to other 
segments within the word. Among speakers from established San’ani families 
within the old city, evidence of labial protrusion in the pharyngeals is seen in a few 
non-derived stems which have rounded [dorsal] vowels; for other speakers, the 
same stems have non-rounded [dorsal] vowels. Consider the following examples 
(non-labialized forms from speakers outside the old city given in brackets):
(40) 
ulbuh 
‘fenugreek’ 
(ilbih)
 
curus 
‘wedding’ 
(ciris)
 
cušƒ  
‘evening prayer’ 
(cišƒ)
 
cušr¤n 
‘twenty’ 
(cišr¤n)
 
cumwad ‘pillars, columns’ (cimwad)
For established San’ani speakers, there are, however, a large number of stems with 
pharyngeals and adjacent /i/ vowels, including: cind ‘with, at, by’, iss ‘feeling’, 
ilﬁ h ‘entertainment of a guest in family ceremonies’. It seems, therefore, that the 
few stems given in (40) are lexicalized, and that the u vowels here are not the result 
of a synchronic [labial] spread process. There is no evidence of [labial] spread 
from the pharyngeals in derived forms. Consider the examples in (41) (examples 
of [labial] spread from oral emphatics are given in the right-hand column).
(41) 
al-abaših ‘Ethiopia’ 
cf. abaguh ‘layer’
 
matƒif 
‘museums’ 
cf. manƒug ‘regions’
 
ƒmil 
‘pregnant’ 
cf. ƒyum 
‘fasting m.s.’
 
cammih 
‘his paternal uncle’ cf. affuh 
‘his class’
Thus, while [labial] in the pharyngealized coronals has been promoted from the 
status of phonetic enhancing feature to that of phonological feature, in the case of 
the pharyngeals it has not. The pharyngeals are represented with non-primary [gut-
tural], as for the pharyngealized coronals, but without the additional non-primary 
[labial]:
6 In San’ani, emphasis spread from pharyngeals results in a general lowering of adjacent long and 
short vowels, and in the case of long [dorsal] vowels does not produce a guttural oﬀ -glide as it does in 
Cairene. Guttural oﬀ -glides are attested in other Yemeni dialects, however, including dialects spoken 
in and to the south of the province of Ibb.

The slight labial protrusion in the pharyngeals is a phonetic enhancing feature, 
just as lip rounding and labial protrusion is a phonetic enhancing feature in the 
Cairene pharyngealized oral consonants. The fact that the pharyngealized coronals 
in San’ani have an additional non-primary [labial] feature and the pharyngeals do 
not does not mean, however, that the latter should be excluded from the larger class 
of emphatics. Just as diﬀ erent emphatic phonemes may diﬀ er within one dialect in 
the degree of pharyngeal constriction, so one sub-set of emphatics may promote a 
phonetic enhancing feature to the status of phonological feature while another sub-
set does not.
10.6 CONCLUSION
The previous chapters each dealt with a number of related phonological and mor-
phological issues. In this chapter, I focused exclusively on the deﬁ nition and 
description of emphasis and emphasis spread, the complexities of which require 
detailed treatment. Following Jakobson (1957), Garbell (1958), and others who 
expand the notion of emphasis to include the pharyngeals and the uvulars as 
well as the traditional coronal emphatics, I addressed the articulatory and acous-
tic correlates of emphasis, the phonetic realization of emphasis spread in vocalic 
undergoers, the domain of emphasis spread, and the directionality of spread. The 
diﬀ erence in the realization and domain of emphasis spread from the diﬀ erent 
sub-classes of emphatics I attribute to the combinatorial feature speciﬁ cation of 
the trigger segment and to the tension of the dorsum in the articulation of the coro-
nal emphatics. Emphasis spread from the coronal emphatics in San’ani involves 
non-primary [labial] in addition to non-primary [guttural], a feature which serves 
simply as a phonetic enhancing feature in the Cairene emphatics. In contrast to 
[guttural], which spreads predominantly from right to left in both dialects, [labial] 
targets all monomoraic [dorsal] vowels to the right of the emphatic within the 
phonological word, but right-to-left [labial] spread is restricted to immediately 
adjacent [dorsal] vowels within the stem or to the vowel of the imperfect preﬁ x in 
ﬁ nal-weak verbs. The diﬀ erence in the directionality of spread is attributed to an 
asymmetry in timing between the primary and non-primary articulation in second-
ary articulations: while pharyngealization is anchored more on the onset of the 
primary articulation, protrusion of the lips in labialization tends to occur on or after 
the hold phase of the primary articulation. Thus the unmarked direction of spread 
of [guttural] is right to left, while the unmarked direction of [labial] spread is left 
to right.
