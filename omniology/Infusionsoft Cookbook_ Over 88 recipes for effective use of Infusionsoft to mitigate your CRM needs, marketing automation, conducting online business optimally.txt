Preface
Infusionsoft is the premiere all-in-one sales and marketing software for small business. Inside 
this all-in-one tool, beats the heart of a customer database, surrounded by an e-commerce 
platform with automation capabilities flowing throughout. Needless to say there is a lot that 
can be done using Infusionsoft.
This cookbook is designed to help you learn more about the system and get you to the end 
results your business is looking for faster.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Pre-Flight Checks, ensures that you have everything configured to ensure 
maximum functionality. So, even a skilled user should start with this chapter.
Chapter 2, Critical Tools for Mastery, has the tools that are used in many of the recipes. 
Even if you are a skilled user, it would be wise to give this chapter a quick skim to ensure 
that you are familiar with all these tools.
Chapter 3, Attracting Leads and Building Your List, Infusionsoft teaches a three-phase 
framework named Lifecycle Marketing. The first of three phases is Attract, and all the 
recipes in this chapter are designed to help your lead generation efforts.
Chapter 4, Selling Products Online and Getting Paid, explains the second phase of 
Lifecycle Marketing, Sell. This chapter deals primarily with e-commerce selling.
Chapter 5, Selling with a Sales Team, shows that Infusionsoft is a very powerful tool 
for managing a sales force, even if you are the lone salesperson. This chapter focuses 
on selling with a human-managed pipeline.
Chapter 6, Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences, explains the final phase 
of Lifecycle Marketing, Wow. All the recipes in this chapter focus on providing world-class 
experiences for your new customers.

Preface
vi
Chapter 7, Wowing Existing Customers with Great Experiences, extends the final phase 
of Lifecycle Marketing, Wow. All recipes in this chapter are focused around providing 
world-class experiences for your existing customers.
Chapter 8, Administrative – Conquer Internal Chaos, provides some streamlined recipes to 
tame your internal processes. Infusionsoft is often overlooked for its powerful workflow and 
process automation.
Chapter 9, Your Dashboard and Reporting – Make Better Decisions, will empower you to 
search and report confidently because an important discipline in automated experience 
design is extracting performance data and using that to inform improvements.
Chapter 10, Pushing the System with Hacks, is a grab bag of unsupported Infusionsoft 
hacks. These little tactics, when properly executed, can empower some amazing 
automated experiences.
What you need for this book
You will need an Infusionsoft account and an active login. Preferably, a login with admin 
rights to ensure that you have proper permissions to configure all the recipes in this book. 
At the very least, if you are not an admin, you'll want permissions to use the campaign 
builder, as a lot of recipes are implemented from there.
Who this book is for
Intended for those who have at least a cursory understanding of Infusionsoft and already 
know how to use the visual drag and drop builders (campaign builder, e-mail builder, and 
so on). Perhaps you've set up a couple of things already and want to take it to the next level. 
Maybe you are very fluent in the software but lack the high-level strategic understanding of 
how to take your business and automate it for the better. If you are a certified partner that 
has been around for a long time, this book will empower you to provide better results for 
your clients, faster!
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of 
information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, 
dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Click on the name of the 
merge field we want to insert; this will insert a variable that looks like ~xxx.xxx~."

Preface
vii
New terms and important words are shown in bold for example, Infusionsoft. Words that 
you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: 
"Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to the 
Admin column, and click on Settings in the bottom row."
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Introduction
Before any professional caterer leaves for a job, they double-check to ensure that all food 
items and equipment, needed for the specific job, are present. This chapter is intended to 
operate as a double-check of your Infusionsoft before taking off into the recipes contained 
in this book.
The first four recipes are designed to be a good checklist to go through when adding a new 
user; the latter ones are mainly admin or set it and forget it functions.
By ensuring that the following things are set up, you'll be able to get things done faster 
while maximizing the functionality available to you.
For all recipes in this book, we are assuming that the user is logged in to a specific 
Infusionsoft account and has the necessary access permissions.

Setting up your user signature
Each user inside Infusionsoft has their own profile that contains a customizable signature, 
which can be merged into automated communications, such as letters and e-mails. Having 
a user's signature set will save time when configuring those communications.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the person symbol in the upper-right corner of the page and select 
Edit My Profile as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click on the Signatures tab to display the plain text and HTML signatures.
3.	 Configure the user signatures.
4.	 Click on Save at the bottom of the page.

The following screenshot shows a preview of an HTML signature:
How it works...
Every communication sent affords us an opportunity to personalize it with one of the users' 
signatures (such as a sales representative signing off in an e-mail). When this occurs, the 
system will use whatever is set in this area of the user profile. In most cases, you can choose 
which signature type you want to merge—either the plain text or the full HTML signature, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Pre-Flight Checks

There's more...
There are many HTML e-mail signature generators and templates available online. To save 
time, use those as a starting point.
Configuring your calendar
Each user has a calendar that will show any scheduled tasks, appointments, or sales 
opportunities. The calendar settings can be configured to ensure smoother daily operations.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the person symbol in the upper-right corner of the page and select 
Edit My Profile.
2.	 Click on the Preferences tab to display the available user options.
3.	 In the Calendar section toward the middle of the page, we can configure 
the following:


Default Calendar View: This is what is displayed when you click on 
Calendar by navigating—the day when you log in (Day), the Week, 
or the Month


Default Start Hour: This indicates the time when the workday typically 
begins


Default End Hour: This indicates the time when the workday typically ends


Time Zone: This is the local time zone for the user; Infusionsoft assumes 
Eastern Time Zone by default
4.	 Click on Save at the bottom of the page.
How it works...
Depending on your job function, you may rely heavily on the calendar to plan and take action. 
By setting up the calendar to the user's specifications, it ensures that they will have the best 
user experience while performing their daily activities.
There's more...
While looking at a user's calendar, there are visual cues to inform what kind of item is in 
a time slot. A task will be symbolized by a checkmark. An appointment will be symbolized 
by a tiny calendar symbol. A sales opportunity will be symbolized by a $ sign.

The following screenshot shows the three items in a time slot:
Connecting your Facebook account
Infusionsoft can leverage your Facebook account in the following two ways:
f
f
First, you can post an e-mail broadcast, landing page, or web form out to your account
f
f
Second, you can point a Social snippet inside an e-mail to your account and build 
your social network
Connecting your Facebook account to your user profile ensures you can maximize the social 
functions within the program.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the person symbol in the upper-right corner of the page and select 
Edit My Profile.
2.	 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the Social Accounts tab.
3.	 Using the Add an Account dropdown, select Facebook.
4.	 In the pop up message that appears, click on Authorize Account; this will open 
a new tab in the browser.
5.	 Follow the authorization instructions provided by Facebook.
6.	 Back in the browser tab with Infusionsoft, click on Done.
How it works...
Infusionsoft uses Facebook's secure authentication process to connect the user's Infusionsoft 
account with Facebook; technically the system is using OAuth to verify the user.

Twitter account.

Connecting your Twitter account
Infusionsoft can leverage your Twitter account in two ways:
f
f
First, you can post an e-mail broadcast, landing page or web form out to your account
f
f
Second, you can point a Social snippet inside an e-mail to your account and build 
your social network
Connecting your Twitter account to your user profile ensures that you can maximize the 
social functions within the program.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the person symbol in the upper-right corner of the page and select 
Edit My Profile.
2.	 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the Social Accounts tab.
3.	 Using the Add an Account dropdown, select Twitter.
4.	 In the pop-up message that appears, click on Authorize Account; this will open 
a new tab in the browser.
5.	 Follow the authorization instructions provided by Twitter.
6.	 Back in the browser tab with Infusionsoft, click on Done.
How it works...
Infusionsoft uses Twitter's secure authentication process to connect the user's Infusionsoft 
account with Twitter; it uses the same OAuth process as the Facebook connection.

Connecting your Facebook account.
Configuring your company's logo
One of the most common marketing assets used in your messaging is your company's logo. 
To save time while creating messages and stay consistent with your branding, there is a 
Branding Center where we can upload an image to be the company's logo. The system 
uses this logo where appropriate.

Chapter 1
7
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, also inside a specific account, and have the 
appropriate access permissions.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, 
navigate to the Admin column, and click on Branding Center as shown 
in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click on the Logos tab.
3.	 In the Default Logo section, click on Edit in the lower-right corner of the logo preview.
4.	 From here, you can either:


Select an existing image from the file box using the dropdown


Upload your logo using the Add New Image button
5.	 Click on the Save button.
How it works...
Infusionsoft understands that a company's logo can be leveraged in many different ways. In 
other areas of the software where a logo is contextually relevant, it will pull from this area of 
the Branding Center.
The size of logo uploaded determines how it is displayed. Avoid using really large images to 
save time when configuring e-mails; having a 600 px width is a good size.

Pre-Flight Checks
8
There's more...
There are three locations where a logo might show up:
f
f
As a Logo snippet inside the drag & drop builder
f
f
On hosted pages (such as the opt-out screen)
f
f
On sign-in pages
When we upload a default logo using the mentioned recipe, the system automatically sets 
that for the three logo locations. If you want to further customize the logo for each of these 
locations, there is an Edit button that allows you to go through a similar process as the 
recipe mentioned earlier.
It is very important to use the formal Logo snippet while creating e-mails and other messages 
in the drag & drop builder. This ensures that updating your company's branding is easy. All we 
do is upload a new logo to the Branding Center, and the next time anything is sent containing 
a Logo snippet, Infusionsoft will use the new one. If we don't use the Logo snippet, but 
instead use a different method, such as an Image snippet, and our logo changes, we'll have 
to manually go into each individual e-mail, one by one, and update it to the new Logo. Using 
the Logo snippet is a huge time saver that also creates scalability.
There are other areas of the Branding Center that can help to save you a ton of time as well. 
It is here that we can create the default layouts for different objects in the system, such as 
e-mails, landing pages, and web forms. At the very least, create a branded Campaign Email 
template. This way, when we are cooking up the recipes in future chapters, every time we 
create a new e-mail, it will pull in our branding and we can begin writing immediately.
Configuring the CAN-SPAM address block
Legally, every e-mail that comes from an Infusionsoft e-mail server must contain the address 
of the company sending it and a link for the recipient to unsubscribe from future mailings. It 
is important to ensure that the address we set is real and can receive physical mails to 
protect the business legally should any disputes arise.

How it works...
This is the specific area designed to set the CAN-SPAM address block for all e-mails sent by 
Infusionsoft. This ensures that all e-mails being sent are legally compliant with the CAN-SPAM 
laws. Otherwise, a user would be at legal risk if they experience excessive spam complaints.
There's more...
While the Company and Phone fields are available, they are not required. Only the address 
fields highlighted in orange are required.
In the Email section beneath the Address Block section of this page, there are some 
miscellaneous settings we might want to familiarize ourselves with. In particular, we can set 
the default opt-in (confirmation) and opt-out links to save time while creating e-mails. This is 
also where we would go to find the action trigger to cook the Building a Vaynerchuk opt-out 
recipe found in Chapter 7, Wowing Existing Customers with Great Experiences.
Creating new users
As a small business grows, there is a need to add more users to Infusionsoft.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to 
the Admin column, and click on Users as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1

2.	  Click on the green Add Users button:
3.	 Provide the new user's first name and e-mail address. You can also give them full 
system access by clicking on the switch to make them an admin.
4.	 Click on Send Email Invitation:
How it works...
After completing the preceding recipe, the new user will receive an e-mail invitation to log in 
to Infusionsoft. The new user will then need to follow the instructions to claim their invitation.
There's more...
From the list of users we see in the first step of this recipe, you can resend the user invite 
e-mail if someone is having difficulty locating the original invite e-mail.
Each Infusionsoft account has a certain number of available user licenses. However, next 
to the Add Users button, there is also a green Add Partner button. If we are working with 
an Infusionsoft Certified Partner and we want to give them access to our account without 
taking a user license, we can add their Infusionsoft ID there.
The number of user licenses is based on how many active users exist. Therefore, if we need 
to add a user but have no more licenses, we have the option to deactivate a user to free 
up space.

Introduction
Now that we've ensured the user configuration is complete, we can begin to learn about the 
critical tools for mastery of automation experience design. The recipes in future chapters 
assume an understanding of the fundamental tactics introduced in this chapter.
There are two types of Infusionsoft users, and they use different tools for their needs.
www.allitebooks.com

Critical Tools for Mastery
14
The first type and target audience for this cookbook are the builders. These are the users 
who design and implement the automated experiences. These are the types of folks that 
would take a recipe out of this cookbook and use it for their business.
The second type of user is the end user. End users are the sales representatives and 
administrators who work daily with Infusionsoft. Often, they use things created by a 
builder are used by end users to stay organized, grow sales and save time.
Understanding both user types is critical in building a powerful automated experience. 
Therefore, mastery of both tool types is essential.
Creating custom fields
At its core, Infusionsoft is a CRM (short for Customer Relationship Management) system. 
In other words, it is a database of humans that contains information about their interactions 
with a business.
In this database, there are common pieces of information that all businesses would need 
to know about an individual: first/last name, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, 
and so on. There are even more interesting pieces of data as well, such as the person's 
birthday or their spouse's name.
However, there are pieces of data a business might need to collect that don't exist out of the 
box. Take a dog trainer for example. They might want to store a dog's name on the dog owner's 
contact record.
This recipe will show you how to create a custom data field on a contact record. A custom 
field can be merged into a communication or a task, submitted on a form, used as a search/
report filter, and used to route automation logic.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to 
the Admin column, and click on Settings in the bottom row:

Chapter 2
15
2.	 In the Custom Fields section at the top of the page, click on Go.
3.	  Click on Add next to the dropdown menu at the top of the page:
4.	 Give the custom field a name and select Custom Fields type from the 
dropdown menu.
5.	 Click on Show Advanced Options...; this will cause a submenu to be displayed.
6.	 Select a tab where we want the new custom field to be displayed on the 
contact record.
7.	
Select a header where we want the new custom field to be displayed on the 
contact record.
8.	 Click on Save This Field.
How it works...
This recipe is accessing the database table for a person's contact information. The tab/
header chosen will control where the custom field shows up while viewing a contact record.
There's more...
A properly leveraged custom field can make both setup and the automated experience more 
powerful. Remember that a custom field can be merged into a communication or a task, 
submitted on a form, used as a search/report filter, and used to route automation logic. As we 
are creating and bumping into challenges, custom fields are a powerful tool in our back pocket.
There are many different types of custom fields besides a Text field. While creating a custom 
field, always choose the type closest to the type of data being stored. For example, if we wanted 
to store lifetime customer spend, we would want to create a Currency type custom field.
This is important for two reasons. First, when using a custom field to route automation logic, 
the field type helps with context. Infusionsoft understands what a date on the calendar is, and 
hence you can configure logic to say if before a specific date. Had we used a Text field to store 
the date instead, that kind of rule can't be created.

Critical Tools for Mastery
16
Similarly, when using a custom field to filter a search/report, the search parameters also 
understand the context of the field type. If we have a Whole Number type custom field that 
holds how many times someone has made a purchase, we could create a contact search 
saying show me all those whose purchases are more than 5.
When it comes to controlling automation logic based on human input, a Yes/No type, Radio 
type, or Dropdown can greatly reduce human error.
In step 3 of this recipe, we'll see a full list of all custom fields previously created. If we have 
more than one tab, there will be a blue arrow on the right-hand side that allows you to adjust 
the display order. Similarly, if there is more than one header within a tab, we will see the blue 
arrows as well. If you have more than one custom field in a header, we will also see the blue 
arrows. This is to organize how the custom fields display when looking at a contact record.
There are several places elsewhere in Infusionsoft where you can create a custom field 
on the fly. It is recommended to create a custom field first using this recipe as this ensures 
full control of the custom field generation.
It is important to realize that we can only have 100 custom fields per record type. This recipe 
describes how to create a custom Contact field. If we adjust the dropdown next to the Go 
button in step 2, we can create custom fields within other record types. For example, a sales 
representative might want a Time Zone dropdown inside an opportunity record to help them 
plan their calls for the day more efficiently.
Since there is a limit, conserve the custom fields only for situations where we have no other 
option. Also, we can often cut down on custom field bandwidth by spreading out the needed 
fields across different record types. For example, if we need four fields for a purchase, explore 
whether we can put two on the order record and two on the contact record.
While talking to the database directly through the API, often we'll need to find the names of 
the custom fields in the database, as these are different to their display names. To find these, 
in step 3 of this recipe, there is a Show database names link toward the top-right corner of 
the page. This will open a popup window with the database names of our custom fields.

We can sometimes save our precious custom fields by leveraging campaign merge fields. 
See the Using campaign merge fields recipe later in this chapter.
Using merge fields
Merging contact information into an automated communication can be an extremely powerful 
tool to create a relevant, personal experience for the recipient. It can also ruin the customer 
experience if not properly implemented. As a tool itself, it thrives on context and so merge 
fields always need to be used strategically.

Chapter 2
17
While this recipe specifically covers how to insert a merge field into an e-mail, the concept 
extends to any object with merging capabilities (tasks, letters, and so on).
Getting ready
We need to edit an e-mail inside a campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Place the cursor where we want to merge some information.
2.	 Next to the Subject line, click on Merge; this will open a tool palette:
3.	 Click on the merge field category containing the field we want to insert.
4.	 Click on the name of the merge field we want to insert. This will insert a variable 
that looks like this: ~xxx.xxx~.
How it works...
Before Infusionsoft sends the e-mail, it will replace any of these merge field code with 
the appropriate data. For example, ~Contact.FirstName~ becomes Bob, Joe, or Mary. 
This all depends on the contact record that caused the e-mail to be sent:
There's more...
There are more merge types available than just basic contact information. We can merge 
information from the user managing the relationship: the owner of the contact record. This 
can be handy when sending an automated e-mail from the user. We can also merge the 
custom field, referral partner, general company, and date information, such as the day of 
the week.

Critical Tools for Mastery
18
If any campaign merge fields have been created, they will show up at the bottom of the merge 
tool palette.
If the merge palette is getting in the way, we can move it by clicking and dragging the top of 
the palette.

To learn how to merge opportunity record information, see the recipe Merging custom 
opportunity fields into e-mails in Chapter 5, Selling with a Sales Team. To learn how to merge 
credit card record information, see the recipe Updating a soon-to-be-expired credit card 
automatically in Chapter 6, Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences.
Using campaign merge fields
Sometimes, there is information that needs to be merged into a communication or process 
that is the same for all contacts that flow through a campaign. The date and location of 
an event is an example of this kind of information because that information is fixed for all 
contacts flowing through the campaign. A campaign merge field is the tool we can leverage 
for this kind of data.
Getting ready
We need to be inside a campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Campaign dropdown in the upper-left corner of the page and select 
Merge Fields...:

Chapter 2
19
2.	 Click on the green Add Merge Field button.
3.	 Give the new field a label. This is what will be displayed in the merge tool palette. For 
example, if this field were to hold the date of an event, the label could be event date.
4.	 Give the new field a value. This is what will be merged into a communication 
or process. For example, if the date of an event is January 1, the value can be 
January 1st.
5.	 Click on the save icon (floppy disk) in the right column to add the field to 
this campaign.
How it works...
Similar to how a regular merge field works, when Infusionsoft generates a communication or 
process, it will insert the value of the campaign merge wherever the merge code is present.
There's more...
Campaign merge fields can be found at the bottom of the standard merge menu; this menu 
will not be displayed if no campaign merge fields have been configured:
Campaign merge fields are very useful to build a reusable campaign. A great example of this is 
a recurring event. We can create an event date, an event time, and an event location merge 
field within the campaign. The next time we have the same event, we just have to update 
those fields and republish the campaign. There is no need to drill down into the individual 
campaign steps to display that information.

Critical Tools for Mastery
20
In general, any time there is an important piece of information that is the same across 
multiple campaign assets, we should consider using a campaign merge field.

This recipe only shows how to create a campaign merge field. To learn how to insert it into a 
communication or process after creation, see the previous recipe Using merge fields.
Using campaign links
Quite often in a marketing, e-mail we will set the same URL multiple times, sometimes across 
multiple e-mails too. A campaign link is the tool we can leverage for these kinds 
of links to ensure easy maintenance and reusability.
This recipe has two parts: creating the campaign link and inserting it into an e-mail.
Getting ready
We need to be inside a campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Campaign dropdown in the upper-left corner of the page and 
select Links...:

Chapter 2
21
2.	 Click on the green Add Link button.
3.	 Give the new link a name. This is what will be displayed in the campaign link 
dropdown when setting a link in an e-mail.
4.	 Give the new link a destination URL. This is where contacts will go when they 
click on this campaign link.
5.	 Give the new link a description. Be sure to provide enough context behind why 
we are creating the link and how it is used.
6.	 Click on the Save button in the right column to add the link to this campaign.
7.	
Click on the Close button at the bottom of the Campaign Link menu to close it.
8.	 Go through an e-mail in this same campaign.
9.	 Highlight the text you want to connect to this Campaign Link.
10.	 Click on the Link button in the center of the Format toolbar; this will open the 
Link Options menu:
11.	 Change the Link to: dropdown to Campaign link:

Critical Tools for Mastery
22
12.	Select the campaign link you want from the second dropdown that appears:
13.	Click on the green Insert/Update button.
The following screenshot shows the name and URL of the Event Registration Page 
campaign link:
How it works...
Whenever someone clicks on a campaign link in an e-mail, Infusionsoft first checks the 
value of the campaign link and then redirects the recipient to that location.
There's more...
Campaign links are great for reusable campaigns or when a particular URL may change over 
time. For example, we could use a campaign link that points directly to a PDF on your server 
and use that to deliver the PDF in an e-mail. If we ever want to update the PDF, we simply have 
to update the campaign link URL and not update every link within each e-mail individually.
This could also be used to close a shopping cart. We can create a Sales Page campaign link, 
which takes people to a checkout URL. Then use the campaign link in every e-mail that is 
asking for the order. After the promotion is over, we can update the campaign link URL to 
a cart-closed page and republish the campaign. The next time someone clicks on a link in 
those old e-mails, they will be taken to the cart-closed page as the campaign link has 
changed since they originally received it.

Chapter 2
23
Merge field variables will properly work in the URL of a campaign link. This can be a really 
handy trick in certain scenarios.
Creating tags for database segmentation
The more targeted and relevant our marketing is, the more effective it will be. In order to 
segment the database so we can be targeted and relevant, Infusionsoft uses tags. A tag can 
be thought of as a specific list or specific segment of people within your database.
We can apply or remove a tag manually from an individual or a group of individuals. 
A campaign can automatically apply or remove a tag as well.
Besides segmentation, a tag can route automation logic or filter a search/report. 
They can also be used as a goal within a campaign to start or stop it.
In short, understanding how to create a tag is a critical skill for automated experience design.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate 
to the CRM column, and click on Settings in the bottom row:
2.	 Click on Tags in the left-hand side menu:

Critical Tools for Mastery
24
3.	 Click on the green Add Tag button:
4.	 Give the tag a meaningful name.
5.	 Add the tag to a tag category by selecting one from the Category dropdown or 
type a new tag category in the Other field.
6.	 Give the tag a proper full sentence description. If it helps, answer the question, 
What do we know 100% about contacts with this tag?
7.	
Click on the green Add Tag(s) button at the bottom of the page.
How it works...
This recipe directly modifies the database table for tags so that Infusionsoft and its users 
can use them.
There's more...
When adding new tags, we can create multiple tags by separating the names with commas. 
For example, if we created a new tag and named it Widget 1, Widget 2, the system would 
create a Widget 1 and a Widget 2 tag.
The name and category of tag are displayed when looking at a contact record. Keep this in mind 
when naming tags to ensure things make sense for the end user. If a tag means something 
very precise, we definitely want to denote this in the description. However, keep in mind that 
the name and category are the only context an end user receives from a tag and both will be 
truncated if they are too long. Infusionsoft will display the first 16 characters of each before 
adding an ellipsis to indicate that the name is too long to fully display. Err on the shorter side 
for tag names and categories and be long-winded in the description.
There are other areas in Infusionsoft where you can create a tag on the fly. It is recommended 
to follow this recipe always when creating a tag to ensure proper categorization and 
description; it is a good habit for easy-to-admin automation.

Using internal forms for workflow
An internal form is just like a normal web form, but it can only be submitted by a user 
inside Infusionsoft. While creating process workflows, especially task-based workflows, 
a well-placed internal form can create a time-saving experience for the Infusionsoft user, 
thus improving productivity.
Many of the recipes in this book leverage internal forms, so understanding the experience 
of submitting one is a key to building a great workflow.
Getting ready
We need to look at a full contact record, not in My Day.
How to do it...
1.	 Scroll down to the Tasks section of the contact record.
2.	 In the Form Submissions section, select the form we need to submit on the 
Internal Forms... dropdown and click on the Fill Out button:
3.	 Fill out the form with the information it requires.
4.	 Click on the green Save button at the bottom of the form.
How it works...
Submitting an internal form will update the contact fields provided by the user and trigger 
any associated automation.

Critical Tools for Mastery
26
There's more...
When adding a new contact, we can also fill out an internal form, which can also 
trigger automation.
If there is a date type field on the internal form, the user should place their cursor in the date 
field and press i on the keyboard; a popup of keyboard shortcuts will be displayed as follows:
These Quick Date Keys work anywhere in the system where a formal date field exists. End 
users who deal with lots of dates can greatly improve productivity by learning the shortcut 
keys they would most commonly need.

An internal form can also be submitted from the My Day view. See the recipe Working daily 
out of My Day later in this chapter. To learn how a task can drive an Infusionsoft user to an 
internal form, see the recipe Creating great user experiences with tasks later in this chapter.
Using note templates for workflow
A note template is like a big red AUTOMATION button. Any time we need to automate or track 
something and we aren't sure how to do it, we can create a note template. Applying a note 
template can trigger an e-mail, a task, the application of a tag, and so on.
Many of the recipes in this book leverage note templates, so understanding the experience 
of applying one to a contact record is a key to building a great workflow.

Chapter 2
27
Getting ready
We need to look at a full contact record, not in My Day.
How to do it...
1.	 Scroll down to the Tasks section of the contact record.
2.	 In the Notes section, select the note we need to apply using the Note Template... 
dropdown and click on the Add Note button:
How it works...
Applying the note will add the predefined information to the contact's note history and trigger 
any associated automation.
There's more...
If we click on Add Note without selecting a note template from the dropdown, a pop-up 
window will open. The user can manually type a note, select a template, or do both from 
here. Selecting a template from here will trigger the automation tool upon Save even if the 
user makes edits to the information that gets populated.

A note template can also be submitted from the My Day view. See the recipe Working daily out 
of My Day later in this chapter. To learn how a task can drive an Infusionsoft user to apply a 
note template, see the recipe Creating great user experiences with tasks later in this chapter.

Creating great user experiences with tasks
Not everything can be automated. There are certain activities that are too precise or too 
costly to automate. For example, making an outbound phone call to a new lead or adding 
a new customer to a third-party membership site. In these cases, an Infusionsoft user can 
be assigned a task.
A task is a key tactic in the human-machine interaction within Infusionsoft. When the 
automation cannot go any further and needs human intervention, empowering the end user 
to quickly take action and tell the automation machine to continue is a key skill towards 
designing productive automated experiences.
Since creating a great experience with tasks requires understanding the context in which 
the tasks will be performed, for this recipe, let's assume that we have a campaign model 
that looks like this:
In plain English, when a lead comes in through the website, a human is tasked with calling 
them and filling out an internal form to push the lead ahead. Specifically, the user needs to 
submit the Lead - Initial Call form.
This recipe will build a task for this specific purpose.
For simplicity, we are assuming that the Task to Call sequence only contains a Task step and 
the same person will be performing these calls:

Chapter 2
29
In a real-world application, there would most likely be more inside that sequence, such as 
tagging or e-mails.
Getting ready
The name of the internal form that needs to be filled out by the user should be finalized. We 
should be inside the Task step that is instructing the user to fill out an internal form.
How to do it...
1.	 Using the Type dropdown, select Call.
2.	 In the Title field, name it New Lead Call- –Contact.FirstName.
3.	 In the Body field, put Call - –Contact.FirstName – at –Contact.Phone1– 
to see if they qualify. Submit Internal Form "Lead - Initial 
Call" after you have made the call.
4.	 Using the dropdown for Assign to (backup), select the user who will be assigned 
the task.
5.	 Using the dropdown for Priority, select 1. Critical:
6.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to set this Task step as Ready.
7.	
Continue to build the campaign toward publishing.

Critical Tools for Mastery
30
How it works...
When a lead submits the opt-in form on the website, this task is created. Infusionsoft merges 
the information and assigns the task. All the information the end user needs to perform the 
task is in the task body, and the user is told explicitly what to do after the call has been made. 
This should allow the end user to focus and quickly call through new leads.
There's more...
While this recipe is telling the user to submit a specific internal form, we can also tell the user 
to apply a specific note template (or templates if there are multiple possible outcomes).
The name of the goal itself inside the campaign is what will be displayed for the end user 
while looking at the dropdown menus for internal forms or note templates. Using a naming 
convention, such as including Lead - in front of all internal forms associated with the lead 
development process, can further enhance productivity because the end user can find those 
items faster as they will be grouped.
This recipe assumes that the user making the calls has received the proper training to 
perform the phone call. We could have also included a script inside the task body. This 
would further systematize how those new lead calls are performed.
Selecting the most accurate task type ensures the best possible end user experience 
and tracking. Not only is it valuable for administrative reporting, the type is also leveraged 
in the My Day view and Infusionsoft's mobile app for contextual interactions around tasks.
We can create our own custom task types by navigating to CRM | Settings | 
Task/Appt/Note Settings:
The task title can be used as a search filter in the administrative task note reports, but not 
the task body. This can be leveraged for better administrative reporting by adding in naming 
conventions to the task title. For example, prefacing every new lead task's title with [LEAD] 
empowers an admin to easily find tasks with that in the title.

Chapter 2
31
If you set a time for the task, that is when the task will show up on the user's calendar 
inside Infusionsoft. Selecting the most accurate priority ensures the best possible end 
user experience because they are used for visual cues in My Day. Priority can also be 
used to filter administrative task reports.
Installing campaign templates from the 
Marketplace
Some of the recipes in the following chapters can be implemented faster by using the prebuilt 
campaign templates as a starting point for the strategy's framework.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and have the appropriate 
access permissions.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation, go to the Marketing column, and click on 
Campaign Builder, as follows:
2.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on the white Get Campaign Templates 
button; this will open up the campaign Marketplace.
3.	 Search for the campaign we need to install using the search box in the upper-right 
corner of the page.

Critical Tools for Mastery
32
4.	 Hover over the campaign listing we need to install and click on the white Install 
button in the lower-right corner as follows:
How it works...
Infusionsoft's platform has a campaign publishing tool, which gives the ability to export/
import campaigns between applications. Infusionsoft also curates a library of publicly 
available campaigns on the Marketplace part of its platform. This recipe is leveraging the 
publishing tool to pull from this public repository of campaign templates and installing the 
chosen template into our specific Infusionsoft application.
There's more...
Most campaign templates come with launch instructions. Think of it as the recipe for that 
particular model. Even if we don't fully understand what is being done, by following the steps 
impeccably, we can confidently implement the campaign as it was intended.
Infusionsoft regularly releases new campaign models into the Marketplace. Each campaign 
solves for a specific problem, so keeping a finger on the pulse of new releases can potentially 
speed up implementation.
Quite often during implementation, we'll run into common structures, for example, a web form 
to purchase, which is used in most online launch models. These common structures are most 
likely in a campaign template somewhere, so becoming familiar with the library can give you a 
head start on different models.
Connecting web forms together
There are many reasons to create a multistep web form experience. As a conversion 
optimization tactic, progressively collecting information can help you identify the hottest 
leads while the automation handles those who drop off.

Chapter 2
33
Getting ready
We need to be inside a campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out two web forms, as shown here:
2.	 Open the second web form.
3.	 Add a hidden e-mail field to the form, leave the Field Value completely empty, and 
click on Save. Be sure to delete a visible Email field as well if one is present:
4.	 Click on the Settings tab toward the top-left corner of the page and verify the 
Auto-populate Form setting is checked.
5.	 Click the Code tab and copy the web form URL from the Use the Hosted 
Version section.
www.allitebooks.com

Critical Tools for Mastery
34
6.	 Click Back to Campaign in the top-left corner of the page and open the 
first web form.
7.	
Click the Thank-you Page tab at the top-left corner of the page.
8.	 Change the Thank-you Page to Display dropdown to Web address:
9.	 Paste the web form URL into the second form we collected in step 5.
10.	 Check the box to pass the contact's information:
How it works...
Upon successful submission of the first form, the contact will be redirected to the second form 
and the contact's information is magically passed to the second form so they don't have to fill 
out the same details twice.
A form will check to see if someone is already in the database based on their e-mail address. 
By passing the contact's e-mail between the two forms in the background, Infusionsoft can 
track who is filling out each form without having the user input their e-mail every time.
There's more...
In order to autopopulate the hidden e-mail field on a form, the form must be presented using 
JavaScript or a hosted version of the form. Both of these versions contain JavaScript, which 
takes care of this for us. If you embed the form on your site using the HTML code, passing the 
contact information will not populate the hidden field unless we write custom code to do so.

Chapter 2
35
Setting a form as a thank you page also works on order forms. This is how we can create 
one-click upsells and other post-purchase experiences.
Once we have a contact's e-mail address, we can chain as many forms and landing pages 
together as we want. We just have to make sure that each form in the process is sending 
the contact's info to the next in line, and that the receiving form has a hidden e-mail field 
autopopulating. This is a useful tactic in breaking up the online experience of a long intake 
form, such as one that an attorney or doctor would use.
Most of the time it makes sense to add a sequence between the different steps of a multistep 
form experience to recover those who don't make it through the first time. When setting a link 
in an e-mail, you can point directly to the hosted version of a web form or landing page (as 
long as the form's settings allow for autopopulation). This makes it easy to drive contacts 
back to a form if they fall out during a multistep process.

different variations of this recipe.
Chaining campaigns together
More often than not, when one campaign ends or reaches a certain point, another separate 
campaign has to respond accordingly.
A master builder not only has a clear strategy to chain campaigns together, they also leave 
plenty of breadcrumbs for others to follow and understand what is occurring.
For this recipe, let's assume that when Campaign A (sales promo) ends, we want to trigger 
Campaign B (prospect nurture) to start.
Getting ready
We need to create a tag in a Functional category that will be used to chain together the 
campaigns. Once that is created, we need to be inside Campaign A.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the sequence in Campaign A where we want to trigger Campaign B.

Critical Tools for Mastery
36
2.	 Add a new Apply/Remove Tag process to the sequence's flow at the appropriate 
point. In the example here, we are triggering Campaign B after the last e-mail in 
the Campaign A sequence:
3.	 Apply the functional tag that is being used to chain the campaigns together:
4.	 Leave a canvas note explaining what campaign this tag application is impacting:
5.	 Exit out of Campaign Builder and go into Campaign B.

Chapter 2
37
6.	 Drag out a new Tag goal and connect it to the sequence we need to start.
7.	
Name it to indicate that it is triggered by Campaign A. In the following image, 
we are assuming that the form for Campaign B already existed prior to the start 
of this recipe. The bottom chain is the result of this recipe:
8.	 Double-click the Tag goal and configure it for the functional tag being applied in 
Campaign A:
9.	 Finish building the campaign and publish.
How it works...
When a contact reaches the step that applies the functional tag in Campaign A, the Tag goal 
in Campaign B will be triggered, effectively chaining Campaign B to Campaign A.

Critical Tools for Mastery
38
There's more...
We can have the same tag being listened for across multiple campaigns, such as, an Escape 
Hatch tag goal that we add to the end of every prospect marketing campaign. When a contact 
unsubscribes, the trigger can apply this Escape Hatch tag, effectively ending outbound 
marketing from any campaign with the hatch built-in:
Since a Tag goal is used to chain campaigns together, they can also be used to stop 
sequences, as in the preceding Escape Hatch tactic.
This recipe can also be modified to control behavior within the same campaign. For example, 
for auto-tagging from a link, click on an e-mail to start another sequence without stopping the 
main sequence of e-mails:
Remove any functional tags using a remove tag step within the resulting sequence to keep 
contact records clean. A functional tag should not be used for database segmentation.
Leaving notes isn't mandatory for functionality; however, it empowers others to perform 
maintenance without our presence.

Working daily out of My Day
To close out this chapter, we are going to explore the task completion workflow that an end 
user would experience in their daily responsibilities. Understanding this end user context 
helps us design automation that can truly streamline processes and boost productivity.
For this recipe, we are focusing on the workflow of someone who receives tasks to call new 
leads and must indicate the results via a note template or internal form. The recipe will take 
us through one call task.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in as the user assigned with the call tasks and in the working view of 
My Day. This can be accessed from the Home icon in the main navigation, as shown here:
How to do it...
1.	 Click the task title from the list of tasks on the left-hand side of the screen, as 
shown here:

Critical Tools for Mastery
40
2.	 The task information and contact information will load in the right-hand side 
of the screen:
3.	 Perform the task as instructed and fill out any internal forms and/or apply any 
notes indicated.
4.	 In the left pane, check the box to the left of the task title to mark it as completed:
How it works...
My Day aggregates the tasks assigned to the logged in user. The interactive view on the right-
hand side of the screen allows for most contact management functions without having to load 
separate web pages for each contact. This allows the user to quickly complete a list of tasks. 
The automated experience creator heavily influences how fast a user can be by providing the 
right amount of context and guidance for pushing along the automated experience.
There's more...
There is a setting in the user preferences where we can set My Day as the home page 
upon login.

Chapter 2
41
If the logged in user has the appropriate permissions, they can edit the task by clicking on the 
pencil icon in the upper-right corner of the right-hand pane. This is great for pushing up due 
dates to follow up on task completion attempts. This ensures that a task can be addressed 
without being completed, and it will disappear from the list of tasks on the left. When the due 
date comes around again, it will show up on the list of tasks in the left pane.
Often, a user should push up the due date if they cannot complete a task. Include instructions 
in the task body to guide the user and maintain a pseudo-pipeline.
The left-hand panel will show (if any such tasks exist) OVERDUE tasks, tasks due today, and 
tasks with no due date, which are known as SOMEDAY tasks:
The user can adjust which contact fields are displayed in the right-hand pane using the gear 
icon, as shown in the following image:

Critical Tools for Mastery
42
Depending on the nature of the task, displaying only the relevant fields can speed up 
productivity and enhance the focus:
A task's priority is indicated with a visual queue on the right-hand side of the task's title. 
An orange flag indicates the task being critical, a yellow flag indicates that the task is 
essential, and no flag means that the task is non-essential.
For certain task types, a visual queue will be displayed to the left of the task title. 
For example, a call type displays as a phone icon, as shown in the following image:
If a task is connected to a task completion goal for more automation, we might want to 
include that context in the body of the task, so the user is careful to execute the task as it 
was designed. This is especially true when task completion will trigger an immediate e-mail.
When a user must fill out an internal form or apply a note template, it is recommended to 
instruct the user to finish those actions first, then mark the task as completed.
Any scheduled appointments assigned to the current user for today will be displayed on 
the top of the left-hand pane. Clicking on the appointment will load the right-hand panel. 
Instructions can also be included in an appointment's body, just like a task:

Chapter 2
43
There is a quick-add task and an appointment button to the right of the APPOINTMENTS/
TASKS headers, so the user can add new things without leaving My Day.
When adding a task or appointment using the quick-add, assigning it to a contact is not 
required. If this is the case, a person icon will not be displayed to the right of a task/
appointment title in the left-hand pane.
Not all task fields are present in My Day, including custom task fields. If those are needed, 
they can be merged into the task itself upon creation or accessed by opening the full task 
view from the Tasks tab of the interactive view:
A plausible campaign model for the scenario presented in this recipe is as follows:

Filling out an internal form or applying a note template can be performed following the same 
recipes as in Using internal forms for workflow or Using note templates for workflow directly 
from within My Day. The only difference is how you access the form or notes section.

44
For example, we can access internal forms using the forms symbol in the toolbar of My Day:
This is how we access the Notes section in the My Day toolbar:

Attracting Leads and Building Your List

Creating a Contact Us form
Every website needs to have some method for people to make general inquiries. This is 
particularly important for service-based businesses that operate locally. If a website is missing 
a simple Contact Us form, that means good leads from our hard-earned traffic are slipping 
away. Fixing this hole in our online presence creates another lead channel for the business.
Getting ready
We need to be editing a new campaign and have some manner of getting a form on our site 
(either ourselves or via the webmaster).
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new, web form goal and sequence.
2.	 Connect them as shown in the following image and rename all elements for 
visual clarity:
3.	 Double-click on the web form goal to edit its content.
4.	 Add four fields to the form:


First Name


Last Name


Email


Phone (can be left as optional)
The following screenshot shows these four fields:

Chapter 3
47
5.	 Create a custom Text Area field for inquiry comments.
6.	 Add this custom field to the form using the Other snippet and leave as optional:
7.	
Click on the Submit button to change the call to action.
8.	 Change the Button Label button to Please Contact Me! and select Center 
alignment; click on Save.
9.	 Add a Title snippet above all the fields and provide some instruction for the visitor:
10.	 Click on the Thank-you Page tab at the top-left of the page.

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
48
11.	 Remove all elements and replace with a single Title snippet with a confirmation 
message for the visitor:
12.	Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the form 
to Ready.
13.	Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and open the 
connected sequence.
14.	 Drag out a new Task step, connect, and rename it appropriately:
15.	Double-click on the Task step and configure it accordingly. Don't forget to merge in 
any appropriate information or instructions for the end user:
16.	 Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the task 
to Ready.

Chapter 3
49
17.	 Click on Back to Sequence in the upper-left side of the page.
18.	Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the sequence 
to Ready.
19.	Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and publish 
the campaign.
20.	Place the Contact Us form on our website.
How it works...
When a website visitor fills out the form, a task is created for someone to follow up with 
that visitor.
There's more...
For a better experience, add a request received e-mail in the post-form sequence to establish 
an inbox relationship. Be sure to respect their e-mail preferences as this kind of form 
submission isn't providing direct consent to be marketed to.
This out of the box recipe creates a dead end after the form submission. It is therefore 
recommended that you drive traffic from the thank you page somewhere else to capitalize 
on visitor momentum because they are very engaged after submitting a form. For example, 
we could point people to follow us on a particular social network, an FAQ page on our site, 
or our blog.
We can merge any captured information onto the thank you page. Use this to create a 
personalized experience for your brand voice:
We can add/remove form fields based on our needs. Just remember, a Contact Us form is 
for general inquiries and should be kept simple to reduce conversion friction; the fewer fields 
the better.
If we want to segment inquiries based on their type, we can use a radio button to segment 
inquiry types without sacrificing a custom field because the form's radio buttons can be used 
within a decision node directly coming out of the form.

Building a lead magnet delivery
A lead magnet is exactly what it sounds like: it is something designed to attract new leads like 
a magnet. Offering some digital resource in exchange for contact information is a common 
example of a lead magnet.
A lead magnet can take many different forms, such as:
f
f
PDF
f
f
E-book
f
f
Slideshow
f
f
Audio file
This is by no means an exhaustive list. Automating the delivery and follow-up of a lead magnet 
is a simple and very powerful way to save time and get organized. This recipe shows how to 
build a mechanism for capturing interested leads, delivering an online lead magnet via e-mail, 
and following up with people who download it.
Getting ready
We need to have the lead magnet hosted somewhere publicly that is accessible via a URL and 
be editing a new campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new web form goal, link click goal, and two sequences.
2.	 Connect them as shown in the following image and rename all elements for 
visual clarity:

Chapter 3
51
3.	 Create a Campaign Link and set it as the public download URL for the lead magnet.
4.	 Double-click on the web form goal to edit its content.
5.	 Design the form to include:


A Title snippet with the lead magnet's name and a call to action


A first name and e-mail field


A call to action
The form should look as follows:
6.	 Set a confirmation message driving the visitor to their e-mail on the thank you page:
7.	
Mark the form as Ready, go Back to Campaign, and open the first sequence.
8.	 Drag out a new Email step, connect, and rename it appropriately:

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
52
9.	 Double-click on the Email step and write a simple delivery message. Make sure the 
download link(s) in the e-mail are using the campaign link. For best results, thank 
the person and tease some of the information contained in the lead magnet:
10.	 Mark the e-mail as Ready and go Back to Sequence.
11.	 Mark the Sequence as Ready to go Back to Campaign.
12.	Double-click on the link click goal.
13.	Check the download link within the e-mail and go Back to Campaign:
14.	 Open the post-link click goal sequence.
15.	Drag out a Delay Timer, an Email step, and connect them accordingly.

Chapter 3
53
16.	 Configure the Delay Timer to wait 1 day then run in the morning and rename the 
Email step:
17.	 Double-click on the Email step and write a simple download follow-up. Make sure it 
furthers the sales conversation, feels personal, and gives a clear next step:
18.	Mark the e-mail as Ready and go Back to Sequence.
19.	Mark the sequence as Ready and go Back to Campaign; publish the campaign.
20.	Place the lead magnet request form on our website.
21.	 Promote this new offering across social media to drive some initial traffic.

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
54
How it works...
When a visitor fills out the lead magnet request form, Infusionsoft immediately sends them 
an e-mail with a download link for the lead magnet. Then it waits until that person clicks the 
download link. When that happens, Infusionsoft waits one day then sends a follow-up e-mail 
addressing the download behavior.
There's more...
If the lead magnet is less than 10 MB, we can upload it to Infusionsoft's file box and grab a 
hosted URL from there. If the lead magnet is more than 10 MB, use a cloud-based file-sharing 
service that offers public URLs such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box.
Leveraging a campaign link ensures updating the resource is easy, especially if the link is 
used in multiple places. We can also use a campaign merge field for the lead magnet title 
to ensure scalability and easy duplication of this campaign.
It is important the word Email is present in the form's Submit button. This primes them for 
inbox engagement and creates clear expectations for what will occur after they request the 
lead magnet.
The download follow-up should get a conversation going and feel really personal. This tactic 
can bubble up hot clients; people appreciate it when others pay attention to them. For a more 
personal experience, the lead magnet delivery e-mail(s) can come from the company and the 
follow-up can come directly from an individual.
Not everyone is going to download the lead magnet right away. Add extra reminder e-mails 
into the mix, one at three days and then one at a week, to ensure those who are genuinely 
interested don't slip through the cracks.
Add a second form on the backend that collects addresses to ship a physical copy if 
appropriate. This would work well for a physical print of an e-book, a burned CD of an audio 
file, or a DVD of video content. This builds your direct mail database and helps further 
segment those who are most engaged and trusting. We can also leverage a second form to 
collect other information like a phone number or e-mail subscription preferences.
Adding an image of the lead magnet to the page containing the request web form can boost 
conversions. Even if there is never a physical version, there are lots of tools out there to create 
a digital image of an e-book, CD, report, and more.
This recipe is using a web form. We can also leverage a formal landing page at the 
beginning if desired.
Although we can tag those who request the lead magnet, we don't have to because a 
Campaign Goal Completion report can show us all the people who have submitted the 
form. We would only need to tag them in instances where the goal completion needs to be 
universally searchable (for instance, doing an order search via a goal completion tag).

Maximizing social sharing of your e-mails
Infusionsoft makes it easy for e-mail recipients to share an e-mail on their social networks 
via the Social snippet. Being able to capture leads from these social shares is an esoteric 
function of Infusionsoft that is extremely powerful when used properly.
This recipe has two parts:

Second, we will connect this web form to an e-mail so the form displays when the 
e-mail is shared socially

We need to be editing a new campaign and have an e-mail prepared that we wish to use with 
social sharing.
How to do it...
Here we would be building a web form. to do so:

Add a Spotlight snippet and provide some context for the form. Remember, whoever 
sees this will have arrived here from a social share of an e-mail:
8.	 Click on the Thank-you Page tab at the top-left of the page.
9.	 Remove all elements and replace with a single Title snippet with a confirmation 
message for the visitor:

Chapter 3
57
10.	 Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the form 
to Ready.
11.	 Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and open the 
connected sequence.
12.	Configure the necessary tag and/or field updates so the contact is on your 
broadcast list.
13.	Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the 
the sequence to Ready.
14.	 Click on Back to Sequence in the upper-left side of the page.
15.	Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the 
sequence to Ready.
16.	 Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and publish 
the campaign.
Here we would be connecting the web form to the e-mail. To do so:
1.	 Open the e-mail you wish to use with social sharing.
2.	 Add a Social snippet to the e-mail, and ensure the Sharing Options are not
 selected and Labels are Off; click on Save:

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
58
3.	 Add a Title snippet and provide a call to action to share:
4.	 Click on the Layout & Style button in the upper-right side of the Format toolbar to 
open the Layout and Style sub-menu:
5.	 In the Layout menu, turn on the Social Sharing Layout.
6.	 Type the name of the form we set up in the first part of this recipe and select it:
7.	
Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the e-mail 
to Ready.
8.	 Click on Back to Sequence in the upper-left side of the page.
9.	 Click on the Draft button in the upper-right side of the page to change the sequence 
to Ready.
10.	 Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and publish 
the campaign.
11.	 Send the e-mail we configured earlier.

Chapter 3
59
How it works...
At the end of creating the web form section, we have a published web form. That enables 
the form to be selectable from within the Layout menu's Social Sharing Layout setting of an 
e-mail. Now, whenever someone shares the e-mail socially, their friends/followers will see the 
e-mail and the form:
There's more...
We can preview the e-mail to see what the social share will look like.
This tactic should only be used where it makes sense. Newsletters and other content-rich 
e-mails bode well. It is also important to avoid using social sharing in general on e-mails 
that include sensitive information.
Treat a socially added opt-in like a normal new subscriber and add a welcome e-mail to 
the sequence. Encourage a social follow since they are on social media already.
This tactic can be used during a launch to boost virality. In that case, we should create a 
unique web form for every e-mail that could potentially be shared socially. This ensures a 
highly customized experience for each share and more transparent reporting on which 
e-mails convert the best socially.
Fair warning: If we choose this tactic, we will want to lay out 
the campaign model(s) adeptly to avoid an unmanageable 
structure of web forms.

Attracting Leads and Building Your List

Consider tagging socially opted-in contacts with a special tag so we can isolate those who are 
socially active and we can leverage this subset of our list strategically. For example, send the 
first launch e-mail to these contacts and include a heavy call to action for social sharing. Then, 
send the first launch e-mail to the rest of your list a little while after the social shares have 
begun to permeate, in essence, amplifying the social proof.
We can also use social share links for link click goals within a campaign. This can be used to 
create a game layer powered by social sharing. Tell people they will get something for sharing 
the e-mail socially and automate the delivery using the post-link click sequences.
Alternately, we use link click goals on social sharing to deliver surprises and hidden rewards 
for social engagement. Don't tell people they will get something and really reward those who 
are truly engaged with our message.
We can have multiple Social snippets within a single e-mail. Embed multiple sharing 
opportunities throughout the e-mail's content to boost sharing rates; track which ones are 
performing best using link click goals.

Collecting leads from in-person events
In-person events are frequently chaotic. Having an easy-to-access lead capture form can 
provide confidence that each new connection we make will be properly added to our database.

12.	Drag out a new Task step, connect, and rename it appropriately:
13.	Double-click on the Task step and configure it accordingly. Don't forget to merge in 
any appropriate information, context, or instructions for the end user:

17.	 Click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left side of the page and publish the 
campaign.
18.	Bookmark the form URL on our smartphone or laptop for easy access during 
the event.
How it works...
When we are at a live event and get a new lead, we can access the form on our phone quickly 
and enter their information. By building this habit we ensure there is a follow-up task for each 
new lead when we come home from the event and nobody slips through the cracks.
There's more...
Set the form width to 350 px for a better mobile experience.
Add other things besides a task into the sequence to streamline the follow-up. There are 
many other things that may need to happen with a new event lead such as tagging, sending a 
welcome e-mail, or starting another campaign.
To cut through the promotional haze of a live event, send a follow-up e-mail the day after the 
event is over or the following Monday.
Add more fields to the form per the business needs. Add radio buttons or checkboxes to 
be used in a decision node post-form. This can be used to assign owners, add to specific 
promotions, and tag for segmentation.
For easy distribution to company reps, shorten the form's URL using Bit.ly or another service. 
We can also e-mail the form URL and have them bookmark it.
Create a unique form for every event and use a hidden lead source field on the form. Populate 
the hidden field with a lead source for the event to enable easy Return On Investment (ROI) 
calculation in the future.
The smartphone app Snap by Infusionsoft can make data entry easy for new connections you 
make. In that case, we will want to start this campaign with a tag that is applied from within 
the app.

Leveraging offline media for lead generation
Despite the proliferation of the Internet and smartphones, offline media can still be an 
extremely powerful lead generation channel. Strategically placing a URL somewhere within a 
letter, billboard, and so on gives us the ability to collect leads automatically.
Strategy is all based on context, so for this recipe, let's pretend we are going to be generating 
leads for a charity using a flyer that has already been designed.

How it works...
When people see the flyer and are intrigued, having a short and simple URL makes it easy for 
them to take action. Driving them directly to an opt-in ensures hot leads can bubble up quickly.

Chapter 3
67
There's more...
Set the form width to 350 px for a better mobile experience.
Add other things besides a task into the sequence to streamline the follow-up. There are many 
other things that may need to happen with a new lead such as tagging, sending a welcome 
e-mail, or starting another campaign.
Since we are switching messaging channels from offline to online, we need to make sure 
the branding on the form matches the branding of the offline media. Interested leads should 
never have any doubt they are on the right web page.
We can extend the form into a multi-step form for further segmentation and data collection. 
For example, if we are a home service business, we could ask for someone's address on the 
thank you page of the initial opt-in to help with scheduling appointments.
In general, the thank you page should never be a dead end. Drive new leads back to your 
website, to a social channel, or even to call you immediately. Make sure wherever we send 
them is mobile friendly!
The form's messaging should match the call to action on the offline media as much as 
possible. Even if there is a main call to action on the offline media, this recipe can work well 
as a secondary response mechanism for those not quite ready.
For added mobile friendliness, create a QR code for the form URL and place on the offline 
media in addition to the shortened URL.
To track the ROI of things like flyers and posters, pass through a lead source ID in a hidden 
field in the form's URL before shortening it. For example, if a flyer's lead source ID is 123, by 
appending ?inf_field_LeadSourceId=123 to the form's URL, Infusionsoft will assign 
that lead source to all people coming from that specific flyer. This enables us to drive different 
versions of offline media (each with their own lead sources) to the same form and track how 
each is performing.
Has the offline media already been printed? Still want to use this recipe? Get serious about 
lead generation and print out white label stickers with the shortened URL and place them on 
the media. It won't be pretty, but it will provide additional lead generation possibilities.

Creating a simple referral request
Social proof is very persuasive. People tend to trust their friends and family more about a 
buying decision than anything else. Having a system to ask for referrals from your existing 
customers is a great way to lower customer acquisition costs because referrals are normally 
easier to close.
Getting ready

How it works...
When an employee wants to ask a customer for a referral, all they have to do is apply the 
Admin - Ask for Referral note to the contact record. This delivers an e-mail pointing to a referral 
collection form. When the form is submitted, it is creating a new contact record. This is why we 
uncheck the auto-population setting to ensure that the customer providing the referral doesn't 
get confused when they arrive at the form. If the setting was left on, they would see their own 
information in the My Friend's fields.
There's more...
In order to link to a hosted web form (or landing page), the form must be published at least 
once. This is why we published the campaign mid-recipe.
We can change this recipe to start with a tag goal and automate it from other campaigns. 
For example, triggering this campaign after a positive survey response.
We can use the admin task/note reporting to track which employees are asking for the most 
referrals. The note will be assigned to the user who applied it.
Collecting an e-mail address for a referral and e-mailing without permission would violate 
Infusionsoft's Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP). However, we can call the referral and get their 
permission to e-mail directly.
On the thank you page of the form, we can also link back to the form again so people can do 
multiple referrals.

Building an automated Twitter offer
Twitter has an ad product called a Lead Generation Card where users can redeem offers 
directly from within their feed. This sends their name, username, and e-mail to whomever 
is running the offer. Infusionsoft has built-in integration that makes it easy to automatically 
follow up with new leads acquired in this way.
However, a Lead Generation Card is not an ad by itself. It has to be attached to a promoted 
tweet. Meaning you can use the same Lead Generation Card across many different ads.
Similar to a strategy, an offer is all about context. For this recipe we are going to pretend that 
the offer on the Lead Generation Card is for the user to redeem an e-book.

Double-click on the Email step and write an e-book delivery message. Make sure the 
download link(s) in the e-mail are using the campaign link. For best results, thank the 
person and tease some of the information contained in the e-book:
8.	 Mark the e-mail as Ready and go Back to Sequence.

10.	 Double-click on the link click goal.
11.	 Check the download link within the e-mail and go Back to Campaign:
12.	Open the post-link click goal sequence.
13.	Drag out a Delay Timer, an Email step, and connect them accordingly.

book it resides in a URL that looks like: https://ads.twitter.com/
accounts/~Twitter.Hash~/cards.
4.	 Click on the blue Create Lead Generation card button:
5.	 Provide a short description of the offer, the image to be used, and the call to action:

8.	 Give the card a name, agree to the terms, and click on Create Card:
9.	 Verify the card was submitted successfully on the next page. We may also wish to check 
the Historical Performance view of the campaign to verify the goal was triggered.
10.	 Back at the main campaign dashboard, start a new Leads on Twitter campaign:

Attracting Leads and Building Your List

11.	 In the Creative section, there is an option to load this Lead Generation Card:
How it works...
When a Twitter user redeems the offer from the Promoted tweet, Twitter posts their user 
information directly to Infusionsoft, which triggers the offer delivery sequence.
There's more...
Remember that even though this recipe used the example of an e-book, the Twitter goal can 
be used to deliver any offer. The magic is in pushing the user's e-mail into Infusionsoft and 
starting some type of automation.
For maximum effectiveness, use a unique web form as the fallback URL for each Lead 
Generation Card. This way, we can customize the experience and address if their device 
doesn't work with the offer:

Chapter 3
81
The following is an example fallback web form:
We can also add a destination URL where the user will be directed to when they redeem 
the offer:
Add a Facebook custom audience pixel to your destination URL page. If someone uses 
Twitter, they might also use Facebook. That would lay the groundwork for a multi-channel 
social campaign.

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
82
Point the destination URL to a hosted landing page to create a two or more step collection 
process. Since the user's e-mail will not be passed to the destination URL, remember to 
collect the e-mail address again on the landing page; label the e-mail field as Confirm Your 
Email Address for a smoother experience:
For faster implementation, connect a new Twitter goal to an existing offer sequence:
The download follow-up should get a conversation going and feel really personal. This tactic 
alone can bubble up hot clients just because someone is paying attention to them. For 
a more personal experience, the offer delivery e-mail(s) can come from the company and 
the follow-up can come directly from an individual.
Not everyone is going to download the offer right away. Add extra reminder e-mails into the 
mix, one at three days and then one at a week, to ensure those who are genuinely interested 
don't slip through the cracks.

Chapter 3
83
Not every display platform shows all elements of the Lead Generation Card. Within Twitter 
there are ways to view how the ads will look on different devices. At a minimum, there will 
always be the image and the call to action button. Including the offer in a text overlay on the 
ad image ensures all users regardless of device will see your offer.
Adding the offer itself into the Lead Generation Card's image can boost conversions. Even if 
there is never a physical version, there are lots of tools out there to create a digital image of 
an e-book, coupon, report, and so on. If we Google stuff like "e-book cover generator", we can 
find those tools. These digital renderings can also be used in the offer delivery e-mails.
Although we can tag those who redeem the Lead Generation Card, we don't have to because 
a Campaign Goal Completion report can show us all people who have submitted the form.

Twitter Leads campaign from the Marketplace. For a recipe that delivers an offer using a web 
form or landing page, see the Building a lead magnet delivery section earlier in this chapter.
Growing your social media following
In this age of technology, relationships are king. The more channels we can connect with 
someone, the greater the potential for a relationship. By intentionally asking people to follow 
us, we can systematically build more communication channels to the database.
For this recipe, let's pretend we want to invite people to follow us on Twitter.
Getting ready
We need to have a social profile URL and be editing a new campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new tag goal, link click goal, and one sequence.

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
84
2.	 Connect them as shown in the following image and rename all elements for 
visual clarity:
3.	 Create a campaign link and set it as the social profile URL.
4.	 Create a functional tag to trigger the campaign.
5.	 Double-click on the tag goal and configure it for this functional tag; click on Save:
6.	 Open the connected sequence, drag out a new Email step, connect, and rename 
it appropriately:

Chapter 3
85
7.	
Double-click on the Email step and write a simple follow request. Make sure the follow 
links in the e-mail are using the social URL campaign link. For best results, thank the 
person and provide a reason why they should follow us on that particular channel:
8.	 Mark the e-mail as Ready and go Back to Sequence.
9.	 Mark the sequence as Ready to go Back to Campaign.
10.	 Double-click on the link click goal.
11.	 Check the social link within the e-mail and go Back to Campaign:

Attracting Leads and Building Your List
86
12.	Publish the campaign.
13.	Apply the functional tag from other campaigns where it is appropriate to invite 
someone to follow on social media.
How it works...
When the functional tag is applied to a contact record, an e-mail goes out driving them to our 
social profile. From there, the hope is they will add our profile. The link click goal allows us to 
track engagement.
There's more...
Not everyone is going to follow you right away. Add extra reminder e-mails into the mix but not 
too often to avoid list burnout. Doing another reminder in one month and then three months 
later is harmless. Make sure those reminders are configured in the link click goal as well so 
the series stops when they click to view our social profile.
By leveraging a campaign link this will ensure that updating the social URL is easy; especially 
if the link is used in multiple places. This also ensures you can copy the campaign easily for 
other social channels.
Set up two versions of this recipe: one for new leads and one for new customers. This will 
allow us to further target the follow request.
Add a delay timer to send during (or NOT during) normal business hours to create a more 
personal experience.
Use the proper lingo for the specific channel in the e-mail's call to action (for example, 
Like us on Facebook instead of Follow us on Facebook).
Build an I don't use Twitter link in the P.S. and tag those people. This creates an anti-list you 
can use strategically in other places:

Chapter 3
87
Keep these e-mails short because they are just driving them to your social profile quickly, not 
keeping them in their inbox.
Although we can tag those who click to the social profile, we don't have to because a 
Campaign Goal Completion report can show us all people who have clicked. There are only 
two times we would need to tag. First is, if the click will trigger some other sequence without 
stopping the current one, the tag can fire a tag goal. Tagging on click is also how we can 
segment a campaign based on engagement. We can configure a decision node to check for 
certain tags and respond accordingly.
Adjust this recipe by using a note template at the start instead. This can be particularly effective 
if using with a sales team and the e-mail comes directly from the sales representatives:
Create a task to check and verify a follow from the link click goal. Point that task to an internal 
form with a radio button to confirm whether or not that person followed. This allows us to 
segment based on their social activity:

Building an inbound phone call lead capture
Having a system to reliably collect and distribute leads from inbound phone calls is critical for 
a well-oiled sales machine. This is also very important for any print media where the call to 
action is to call the company because it ensures easy ROI tracking.
The context behind why someone might call is important, so for this recipe let's pretend 
people are calling in to schedule a free consultation from an ad.
Getting ready
The ad needs to be finished and we need to be editing a new campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new web form goal, and two sequences.
2.	 Connect them as shown in the following image and rename all elements for 
visual clarity:
3.	 Double-click on the web form icon in the lower-left corner of the web form goal to

20.	Publish the campaign.
21.	 Run the ad.
How it works...
When someone calls in from the ad, the phone rep fills out the Lead - Print Ad Inbound Calls. 
Based on whether the caller scheduled or not, the proper automated follow-up is delivered.
There's more...
This recipe can easily be modified for a variety of inbound phone call outcomes.
We can add/remove form fields based on our needs. Just remember that this form is being 
used for inbound phone calls.
Use different phone numbers to track different ad versions. There are many different services 
out there that provide trackable phone numbers for this purpose. If we are using trackable 
phone numbers, add a lead source field to the form and create a unique lead source per 
phone number. Then make sure our phone reps are properly tracking which number was used 
using those lead sources. This will enable easier ROI reporting.

Chapter 3
93
We can add a Create Opportunity step if the inbound call is for lead generation going to 
a sales representative:
Sometimes we have a group of users to whom we want to distribute opportunities. In these 
situations, use a round robin step first to assign an owner. Check the user guide to learn 
how to set up a round robin.

Creating a PPC lead generation funnel
Having a progressive funnel allows the hottest leads to move at their own pace while normal 
leads can be nurtured and bubbled up over time. Pay Per Click (PPC) can be very expensive 
but those costs can be minimized over time using a progressive funnel.
For this recipe, let's pretend we are a service-based company (like a plumbing business) 
running PPC ads so people can request a service call.

How it works...
When someone clicks through the PPC ad, they can begin requesting a service call by 
submitting their name and e-mail. The next page asks for their phone number and the last 
page asks for their time of day preference. When someone goes through all three steps, a 
higher-priority task is created to show up on the calendar at either 8 am or 1 pm. If someone 
only provides a phone number, a task is created to call them. If someone doesn't submit their 
phone number initially, in 15 minutes a reminder e-mail automatically goes out driving them 
back to share their phone number.
There's more...
Although this recipe is functional, in real life we would intentionally design all forms/steps to 
match the brand and voice. Especially when it comes to a PPC ad, the look and feel of the ad 
image must match the first step's look and feel for optimal conversions. The visitor should 
have no doubt they are in the right place after clicking.
We built backwards in this recipe to minimize clicking back and forth between web forms.
Don't leave a dead end on the Step 3 thank-you page. This can easily be extended to an 
order form for a one-time offer, a social media nudge, or something like a newsletter opt-in.
We can add/remove form fields based on our needs but the first step should always just 
collect a name and e-mail as this is the minimum required for follow-up. We can collect all 
the other information we want in future forms. If anything, we can add a third question on 
the first step that begins segmenting the visitor, such as the service type request.
Track PPC and ROI by appending ?inf_field_LeadSourceId=xxx to the end of the Step 
1 form URL and adding a hidden lead source field; where xxx is the lead source ID for the 
specific ad. This only works with the JavaScript or hosted version of the form because the 
auto-populating code using URL queries is present in those versions.
Setting up web analytics
Infusionsoft has some built-in web tracking that creates anonymous visitor profiles per 
device. When someone opts in through a web form, if there is a visitor profile for that device, 
Infusionsoft will merge their visitor activity into the contact record. This allows us to dig deeper 
into the browsing behavior of our database.
This recipe shows how to find the web analytics tracking code so it can be placed on 
your website(s).

Introduction
The second phase of Lifecycle Marketing is Sell. This chapter concerns itself with different 
tactics to sell products and collect payments online.
Setting up your merchant account
The best way to collect payment for our goods and services using Infusionsoft is to connect 
a merchant account, so we can accept credit cards.
There are many different providers in the world, and Infusionsoft works with a handful of 
them. The setup is similar for all providers, and the only difference is the specific credentials 
each one uses. After completing this recipe, we will be able to collect payment through 
the shopping cart and order forms.

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
106
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to 
the E-Commerce column, and click on Settings:
2.	 Click on Merchant Accounts in the menu on the left-hand side:

Chapter 4
107
3.	 Select your merchant account provider from the dropdown to the right of the page; 
this will open a pop-up window:
4.	 Input your account credentials and click on Save:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
108
5.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to 
the E-Commerce column, and click on E-Commerce Setup:
6.	 In the Payment section, click on Payment Types:
7.	
Check the box next to Process Credit Card Payments, as follows:

Chapter 4
109
8.	 Select the merchant account we set up earlier from the dropdown and click on the 
green Save button in the lower-right corner of the page:
How it works...
When someone checks out using the shopping cart or an order form using this account, the 
merchant account will process their credit card payment.
There's more...
Remember to switch to Live Mode when we are done testing and want to begin transacting 
real currency.
It is recommended that you test the account credentials after step 4 by clicking on Click Here 
in the Test account column; this opens a pop-up window. This function attempts to charge a 
valid credit card 1 penny and then refund 1 penny. A success or fail message will be shown 
to indicate a proper setup: Please note that not all merchant types support this small a test 
transaction, so this function may fail even with the proper credentials. In this case, running a 
test order for $1 should do the trick to test a proper setup:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
110
We can change the currency type by going to the same menu as we did in step 2 and selecting 
Orders. There is a Billing section where we can choose the local currency. This controls 
which currency symbol is displayed inside the application:
See Infusionsoft's Help Center for provider-specific setup instructions.
We can only use one merchant account with the shopping cart, but order forms can 
select which merchant account to use. This means multiple order forms can use multiple 
merchant accounts.
Certain merchant accounts have a Transactional Email setting. Transactional e-mail means 
it will send the receipt version of each payment via e-mail from the merchant. These e-mails 
are often plain text and visually boring.
We can also set up a PayPal account from the same screen we used in step 7.

Chapter 4
111
Infusionsoft has its own payment gateway, which is fast and easy to set up from the same 
screen we used in step 7.
Creating products and subscriptions
Now that our merchant account is set up, we can lay the foundation for the different types of 
selling available. Whether we are selling products through the shopping cart, order forms, or 
opportunities, having the products and/or subscriptions configured unlocks the selling power 
of Infusionsoft.
This recipe has two versions. The first version is for a single purchase product such as 
a consumable, a one-off service, or a digital asset. The second version is for a recurring 
purchase product such as a program subscription or monthly service.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the Infusionsoft symbol in the upper-left corner of the page, navigate to 
the E-Commerce column, and click on Products.

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
112
2.	 Click on the green Add a Product button in the upper-right corner of the page:
3.	 Give the product/subscription a name, keep the product type as Product, and click 
on Save:
The single purchase version of this recipe
1.	 Add a short description and a price:
2.	 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Save.

Chapter 4
113
The recurring purchase version of this recipe
1.	 Add a short description and set the price as the subscription price.
2.	 Click on the Subscription Plans tab, check the Subscription Only box, 
and click on the green Save button at the bottom of the page:
3.	 After the page reloads, click on the Subscription Plans tab again and set the 
subscription terms:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
114
4.	 Click on Add, and once the plan displays at the bottom of the page, click on the 
green Save button:
How it works…
Anytime an order is created inside Infusionsoft, manual or automated, the line items for the 
purchase can make use of these different products.
There's more…
Setting the subscription cycles to 0 means there is no end date for the subscription; 
it will bill the customer until they cancel.
We can turn on inventory tracking and notifications in the main E-Commerce | Settings menu:

Chapter 4
115
This setting enables a tab on products where we can set inventory levels and a low 
inventory notification:
While we don't have to use products/subscriptions for manually created orders, in doing so, 
it also empowers per-product reporting and helps standardize our offerings. It also saves the 
end user time while creating the order's line items.
This recipe gives us a bare-bones product that can be used in an order form or the shopping 
cart. For a better customer experience, add a product image. These show up on order forms 
and in various places around the shopping cart:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
116
The long description of a product is only relevant if we are using the shopping cart function; 
order forms do not display this information.
Certain products may have different options that can be configured by the customer, for 
example, the text for a personalized monogram. There are two types of product options: fixed 
and typed. The first type is an option with fixed selections such as the size of a shirt. The 
second type is text like the previous monogram example. We can have no more than three 
options per product.
Product options should only be used on shopping carts as a customer 
cannot select product options on an order form.
The following screenshot shows the various constraints for fixed product options:

Chapter 4
117
For typed product options, there is a significant amount of constraints that can be imposed to 
ensure proper submission types:
Categories are helpful to organize the storefront. They can also be used for discount promotions.
If we want to hide certain products from the shopping cart, because those products are only 
sold on an order form, we can hide a product from the product listings using the shopping cart 
options in the Product Information tab:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
118
Clicking on the Edit button displays a menu where you can choose to hide this product listing 
from the storefront by checking the Is hidden in cart checkbox:
We can sell as a single-serve product or subscription using one listing; simply configure both 
those elements of the product. For example, the full price of a product can be $100 or there 
could be a two-month subscription for $50. This is similar in function to a payment plan, but 
there are some technical differences. Using a subscription version of a product as a payment 
plan will create multiple order records; one for each time a payment of the plan is charged. 
Using a formal pay plan will keep the product in one order. One final consideration when 
choosing between the two: a payment plan can natively bake in a finance charge, whereas this 
would have to be calculated and added to each cycle in a subscription version of a product.

We can have more than one subscription type per product (for example, annual or monthly). 
In that case, we set the price on the Product Information tab as what will be displayed in  
the storefront for the product.
Building order forms
An order form is a special type of web form that collects credit card information securely 
and, in most cases, processes a payment.
This recipe has two parts. First, we are going to create a theme for our order form. The 
theme is the visual skin of the order form. Next, we are going to create an order form 
using this theme.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account. This recipe assumes 
that a merchant account has already been connected.

8.	 Scroll down and click on Make Active on the theme we want to use:
9.	 Click on the Thank-you Page tab at the top of the page.
10.	 Configure a confirmation message a customer will see upon successful order 
and click on the green Save button:
11.	 Click on the Settings tab at the top of the page.

124
12.	In the Notifications section, check the box and enter an e-mail address that will 
receive successful order notifications; click on the green Save button at the bottom 
of the page, as shown in the following image:
13.	Click on the Links tab at the top of the page to get the order form's URL.
How it works...
When someone visits the order form and submits with correct billing information, a contact 
record is created with an order associated to the product(s) being sold and any relevant 
payments are attempted.
There's more...
We can save time in the future by starting at part 2 and using the previously created theme.
Certain order form themes support PayPal as well.

Chapter 4
125
In part 1, we can preview the theme by hovering over the listing and clicking to preview:
Selecting a two-column layout in part 1 enables another custom HTML area to the right of 
the main order form themes.
If we are comfortable with CSS, we can heavily customize the order form's theme by using the 
Edit CSS tab in the theme setup:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
126
There is a setting on the order form to prevent people from adjusting item quantities. 
This can be useful while selling bundles or products that don't make sense to be sold in 
multiple quantities:
There is an option in the Settings tab to disable promo codes on the order form. This can 
allow us to prevent shopping cart promo codes from being used where they shouldn't be.
In the Settings tab, we can explicitly tell an order form to use a particular merchant account. 
By default, the shopping cart's configured merchant account is used.
The custom header HTML area of an order form is useful for holding the sales copy. This way, 
the order form can operate as a sales page in addition to the point of sale:

Chapter 4
127
Any purchase goals associated with products being sold on the order form will be triggered 
upon successful purchase. This is how we can do automated follow-up based on the 
product purchase.

this chapter.
Implementing an automated cart abandon 
follow-up
When selling products online, people may fall out during the checkout process and not 
complete their order. This is just something that comes with the territory, which is similar 
to the fact that people will unsubscribe from your lists occasionally.
By implementing an automated follow-up when people fail to complete their purchase, 
we can recoup sales that would have otherwise never occurred.
Getting ready
We need to edit a campaign that is driving traffic to a live order form for a purchase.
In the context of this recipe, we are assuming that the campaign model starts off looking 
like this:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
128
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new link click goal, sequence it, and connect/rename it, as shown here:
2.	 Double-click on the link click goal and select all links in all sales e-mails that are 
pointing to the order form; click on Back to Campaign:
3.	 Double-click into the cart abandon sequence and connect a Timer and Email step, 
as shown here:

Chapter 4
129
4.	 Double-click on the Email step and write a message to recover the sale:
5.	 Mark the e-mail as Ready and click on Back to Sequence in the upper-left corner 
of the page.
6.	 Mark the sequence as Ready and click on Back to Campaign in the upper-left 
corner of the page.
7.	
Publish the campaign.
How it works...
When someone clicks the order form from any of the sales e-mails, the link click goal sees 
this behavior and adds them to the abandon sequence. If the purchase doesn't come through 
before the timer, the recovery e-mail is delivered.

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
130
There's more...
If we want to implement a cart abandon follow-up without stopping the primary sequence, 
we can autotag on a link click and use that to trigger the cart abandon follow-up:
We can add extra e-mails to the abandon sequence if we want to extend the recovery process. 
In these e-mails, we can address common objections, add extra purchase bonuses, deliver 
a discount code, and so on.
While the recovery e-mail is automated, for best results, it shouldn't feel automated. Rather, 
it should "just happen" to show up at the perfect time. It is recommended to encourage people 
to reply, so we can close the sale individually for those who bubble up.

campaign from the Marketplace.
Collecting failed automated billing attempts
When using payment plans or selling subscriptions, it is critical to have a failed billing recovery 
process in place to ensure that money isn't slipping through the cracks.
Infusionsoft has billing triggers available that can automate based on a failed payment 
attempt to streamline this process.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.

Chapter 4
131
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation menu and go to E-Commerce | Settings:
2.	 Click on Billing Automation in the menu on the left-hand side:
3.	 Using the Triggers (by type) drop-down menu, select When a credit card autocharge 
attempt is made and click on Add Trigger; this will open a pop-up window, as follows:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
132
4.	 Configure the trigger as follows:


Set the When an autocharge option to Fails


In the And this is option, check the LAST failure


Also, select the product we want to recover payment on
5.	 In the Actions section mentioned later, add an action to apply a failed billing tag 
that is specific to the product we want to recover payment on:
6.	 Click on Save Trigger.
7.	
Go to the Campaign Builder and add a new campaign.
8.	 Drag out a tag goal, note the template goal, and a sequence; connect as seen in the 
following image and rename accordingly:

Chapter 4
133
9.	 Double-click on the tag goal and configure it for the tag we applied in the billing 
trigger; click on Save:
10.	 Double-click on the note template and configure Description and Creation Notes; 
click on Save:
11.	 Double-click into the sequence, drag out a Tag step, a Task step, and connect as 
shown in the following image; rename accordingly:
www.allitebooks.com

134
12.	Double-click on the Tag step and configure it to remove the tag, which starts this 
recovery campaign; click on Save:
13.	Double-click on the Task step and configure with instructions to recover the payment. 
Make sure that the exact name of the note template is present in the task body:
14.	 Mark the task as Ready and click on Back to Sequence on the upper-left side of 
the page.
15.	Mark the sequence as Ready and click on Back to Campaign on the upper-left 
side of the page.
16.	 Publish the campaign.

Chapter 4
135
How it works...
If the last payment attempt for the product fails, the billing automation trigger will apply the 
campaign tag, which creates a task for a user to recover the payment. The note template 
makes it easy to report on which payments are being recovered.
There's more...
We can add a failed payment notification e-mail into the recovery sequence to let the 
customer know about the situation and to expect a phone call.
While this recipe assumes that the final payment attempt has failed, we can easily create 
a unique billing fail tag for each attempt and build a cascading structure to try and recover 
each failed attempt. This can provide further insight into the effectiveness of our 
recovery process:
We can also set up a billing trigger for when a payment is successful and when the previous 
attempt failed. This can save man-hours in the instances where a card fails and then it 
becomes successful on future attempts:

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid
136
In this case, we want to end the recovery campaign with a successful payment tag:
When setting up the billing trigger, if we do not select any product specifically, it will fire for a 
failed attempt on any product. However, it is always recommended to create a unique trigger 
and a recovery campaign because we can customize the messaging for that specific product. 
This also makes it easier to report on different product recovery initiatives.
Infusionsoft also has a membership site product named CustomerHub. One of the features 
is that customers can manage their own orders and subscriptions. This could be used to 
implement a similar recipe that is completely automated.

from the Marketplace.
Creating a one-click upsell
An easy way to boost revenue is to present another offer immediately after a successful 
purchase. When we allow that additional purchase to be made with a single click, it capitalizes 
on the excitement and momentum of their previous purchase; having the customer submit 
another form would introduce unnecessary friction.
For this recipe, we are going to first create a payment plan, then create an action set to 
generate the upsell product order, and finally connect it all within a campaign. Once this 
is done, we'll connect the one-click upsell to the order form.

When a customer successfully places an order using the order form, they are taken to the 
landing page, which presents the one-click offering. The hidden field on the landing page is 
being pre-populated because we are passing it from the order form's thank you page. If they 
accept the offer (also known as submitting the landing page), Infusionsoft will create another 
order for the upsell product for that contact.

Selling Products Online and Getting Paid

There's more...
Don't forget to add any other fulfillment steps for the upsell order!
If we do not select a payment plan when setting up the action set, Infusionsoft doesn't know 
which merchant account to autocharge while creating the order. If this happens, the order will 
be created and the payment will have to be collected manually at a later time.
Orders created via the action set do not charge immediately but rather are run in batches every 
six hours or so. If we need to control access or fulfillment based on a successful payment, we 
can create a billing automation trigger that applies a tag to advance the campaign:
Setting the Date Range Criteria in the payment plan for dates in the past ensures that the 
plan will not display in the shopping cart or on order forms.

Building a one-click upsell or downsell chain
Similar to the previous recipe, we can create a series of one-click offers for additional upsell 
or downsell opportunities. This is a great strategy when we have a variety of complementary 
products/services that enhance the original purchase.

Chapter 4
147
Since this recipe is simply an extension of the previous recipe's strategy (and to avoid a 
needless duplication of steps), we are going to begin with that existing structure and build 
from there.
The strategic context of this recipe is to offer a payment plan on the initial upsell product if 
the customer declines the original upsell and offer a higher ticket item if they do choose the 
original upsell.
Getting ready
In addition to being logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account, we also need to

42.	Click on the Code tab and copy the code from the Javascript Snippet option 
for the web form.
43.	Mark the web form as Ready and click on Back to Campaign in the upper-
left corner of the page.
44.	Double-click on the original landing page created in the previous recipe.
45.	Delete the original decline link beneath the Submit button.
46.	Add an HTML snippet beneath the Submit button.
47.	 Paste in the code from the Javascript Snippet option for the decline web form 
and click on Save:

Chapter 4
153
48.	Publish the campaign.
How it works...
When a customer successfully places an order using the order form, they are taken to the first 
landing page, which presents the first one-click offering. The hidden e-mail field on the landing 
page is being prepopulated because we are passing it from the order form's thank you page. 
The decline button is actually a web form that also has its hidden e-mail field populated; we 
have embedded a second form within the landing page:
If they accept the offer (also known as submitting the landing page), Infusionsoft will create 
another order for the upsell product for that contact and redirect them to the second landing 
page (which has its hidden field populated). If they submit this second landing page, another 
order will be created.
If they decline the original upsell offer, they are actually submitting a web form, which 
will redirect them to the downsell landing page, that will also have the hidden e-mail field 
populated. If they choose the downsell offer, Infusionsoft will create another order for the 
downsell offering.
There's more...
Don't forget to add any other fulfillment steps for the second upsell order or the 
downsell order!
This strategy can be extended to create a chain of different upsell or downsell offers 
depending on the different offers a customer accepts or doesn't; there is no upper limit 
for how deep the offer chain can go. In this case, it is highly recommended to lay out the 
campaign model for clarity and to leave ourselves plenty of canvas notes for comprehension.

Introduction
As we mentioned earlier, the second phase of Lifecycle Marketing is Sell. Whereas the 
previous chapter dealt with selling online, Infusionsoft is also a very powerful tool to sell 
with a sales team.
The campaign model in the final recipe, Building a long-term prospect nurture, could be 
used for either type of selling.

Selling with a Sales Team
156
Setting up a sales pipeline
A pipeline is a clearly defined process flow with specific measureable milestones (or stages). 
A sales pipeline is a set of defined sales stages that sales reps can use to manage their 
leads/prospects.
Infusionsoft has a very easy to use pipeline module known as Opportunities. Although 
the sales milestones will vary from business to business, for this recipe, we are going to 
be building a sales pipeline with the following sales stages:
f
f
New Opportunity: Lead has been identified as someone who should be contacted
f
f
Contacting: Sales rep has made one attempt to get voice-to-voice communication, 
but did not reach the lead
f
f
Engaging: Sales rep has established conversation but the lead has not yet been 
determined as qualified to proceed down the pipeline
f
f
Qualified: Sales rep has determined that the lead has a budget and authority to 
spend it; lead is now a prospect
f
f
Quote Sent: Sales rep has delivered the prospect a quote for the potential sale
f
f
Quote Finalizing: Sales rep is adjusting the details of the quote with the prospect
f
f
Quote Accepted: Prospect has given verbal or written acceptance of the proposed 
quote
f
f
Deposit Secured (Win): Prospect has paid the initial deposit and is now a paying 
customer
f
f
Lost: Lead/prospect is not going to become a customer at this time
This recipe contains two main parts. First, we are going to build the sales stage definitions. 
Then we are going to configure the pipeline settings for the stages that were just created.

How it works...
This recipe lays down the foundation for any pipeline by first declaring the sales stages and 
then configuring the key sales milestone options. The stages and options configured here 
will control how users interact with opportunity records.
There's more...
When creating a pipeline stage, the order determines how the stages displayed in the 
dropdown present to a sales rep working inside an opportunity.
When creating a pipeline stage, Target # Days is helpful for the sales rep when working 
inside an opportunity to see how soon they should be trying to advance a lead/prospect:
When creating a pipeline stage, the probability is used to determine weighted revenue 
forecast reporting. In effect, it is the chance a lead/prospect has of becoming a customer 
based on the sales stage they are currently in. For example, if we set the probability of a 
stage as 50, this means a prospect in that stage who is considering a $1,000 dollar 
product has a weighted revenue of $500 (50 percent of $1,000).
After a pipeline stage has been created, we can click on the Checklist link to open a 
pop-up menu:

Chapter 5
161
This allows us to create stage-specific steps that display when a person is in that opportunity 
stage. Be wary as there is no automation available for steps or searchability:
The only way to look at these is through the Sales History tab at the bottom of an 
opportunity record.
For sales that have an involved or complex fulfillment process (for example, solar panel 
installation), we can add extra stages after the win stage to manage the customer 
fulfillment experience.
We can create custom fields for opportunity records to store critical information or data 
that needs to be reported.
Win or loss reason is an available search option for opportunities. This is great for tracking 
trends and innovating. Requiring the win/loss reason forces the user to choose a reason 
when moving to a win or loss stage and setting the Win & Loss Stages empower certain 
types of sales reports.
In order for a user to be assigned opportunities, they must be part of the group chosen in 
the first dropdown of the Viewing Opportunities options toward the bottom of the Opportunity 
Defaults page. Users can be added to different groups through the Users menu in the 
main navigation:

Working sales opportunities
No matter what kind of process pipeline has been created, the act of "working" an opportunity 
record is the same every single time. By building this workflow into our habits, it ensures that 
nobody slips through the cracks and that there is a very clear digital paper trail of the actions 
taken to work the opportunity.
Getting ready
In addition to being logged into Infusionsoft and inside a specific account, we need to be 
looking at an opportunity record.
How to do it...
1.	 Beneath the Next follow-up action: section, click on the + Add a note about your 
last action link:

Chapter 5
163
2.	 In the What did you do? section, leave concise notes about the action that was taken 
to forward the opportunity:
3.	 Check the Do you want to change it? box beneath the notes we just left.
4.	 Leave notes for our future self about what needs to occur next. The more detail 
and context we can provide the better:
5.	 Using the calendar dropdown, select the date we plan to perform the action we 
just declared:

Selling with a Sales Team
164
6.	 Using the dropdown, select the time we plan to perform that action; click on the blue 
Save button at the bottom of the workflow box:
7.	
If it is appropriate, using the Sales Stage dropdown in the middle of the page, select 
another stage that reflects the current status of the opportunity; click on the green 
Save button:
How it works...
When a user performs this recipe on an opportunity record, the system will:
f
f
Update the opportunity's entry on the assigned user's calendar
f
f
Leave a note in the contact record
f
f
Run any automation associated with a stage move (if a stage change is saved)
There's more...
An opportunity will show up on the assigned user's calendar at next action date and time. 
It will also show up in the Calendar Items widget on the following dashboard:

Chapter 5
165
The note created in the contact record allows us to track what happened and what was 
supposed to happen. This is why leaving impeccable and highly contextual notes in the next 
action is recommended:
To use revenue forecast reporting, the products and/or subscriptions being sold must first 
exist as products in the E-Commerce section already. From there, two things must occur:
f
f
The user must select a closing date on the General tab; the Commit to Forecast? 
checkbox is optional and can be used to filter forecast reports:

Selling with a Sales Team
166
f
f
The user must add items using the Product / Subscription Plans tab; this will add an 
opportunity value in the header next to the title:
If we are tracking the products/subscriptions being sold, we can also generate an order 
directly from within an opportunity:
f
f
Using the dropdown next to the green button group, select Create an Order:
f
f
In the pop-up menu that displays, click on Process; if a merchant account is also set 
up, we can choose a credit card (or add a new one) to immediately run the charge:

Chapter 5
167
This will create an order record for the products/subscriptions listed on the opportunity 
record. If no credit card is used to process the order, Infusionsoft will create an order with a 
balance due.
If the shopping cart is set up with a merchant account, a user can send the prospect a unique 
link via e-mail for them to check out for the items listed in the Products / Subscriptions tab. 
This is known as a Buy Now link:
f
f
Using the dropdown next to the green button group, select Send Buy Now:
f
f
This will open a pop-up window with a pre-populated link in an e-mail that can 
be customized
Clicking on a Buy Now link and purchasing through it are both available automation triggers. 
These can be found in CRM Settings under Opportunity Defaults. Use these to create highly 
relevant automation such as sending the sales rep a Super Hot Lead, call right now e-mail if 
they don't buy in 15 minutes or some other type of follow-up:
For faster next action date selection, it is recommended to get familiar with the date shortcut 
keys. For users who work mainly in the opportunity record, the habit of using these can greatly 
increase productivity. If we place our cursor in a date field and press I on the keyboard, it will 
display a list of shortcut keys. There is a reasonable amount of logic behind each key press so 
feel free to study up. For example, adding a month to the date is M and subtracting a month is 
H because the last letter of month is h. Also, the lower-left corner of the QWERTY keyboard is 
Monday through Friday.

Using round robins for sales teams
Anytime there is more than one user working opportunities, creating a round robin can 
assist in the automated assignment of new opportunities.
For this recipe, we are going to build a round robin for two sales reps that automatically 
assigns new opportunities one at a time when someone has submitted a web form on 
our website.

Chapter 5
169
Getting ready
In addition to being logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account, we need:
f
f
Both sales reps' user accounts created
f
f
A campaign with the website's web form
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and click on Settings in the CRM column:
2.	 In the left menu, click on Round Robins:

Selling with a Sales Team
170
3.	 In the upper-right of the page, click on the Add Round Robin button:
4.	 Give the round robin a name, click on the One record per round option, and click 
on the green Save button:
5.	 Type 1 next to the two sales reps who are in this round robin; click on the green 
Save button:

Chapter 5
171
6.	 Navigate to the campaign containing the web form on our website and open the 
sequence connected after the web form goal:
7.	
Connect a Create Opportunity step; rename appropriately:
8.	 Double-click on the Opportunity step.
9.	 Configure the Starting Stage.
10.	 Using the second dropdown on the far right, select the round robin we just created:

Selling with a Sales Team
172
11.	 Finish configuring the opportunity's Next Action Date and Next Action Notes 
options with the proper context for the sales rep to take action; click on the green 
Save button:
12.	Mark the sequence as Ready and publish the campaign.
How it works...
When someone fills out the Contact Us form on the website, Infusionsoft will create a 
new opportunity assigned to the first user in the Sales Reps round robin. The next time 
someone fills out the form, it will go to the second user.
There's more...
Be careful about automatically assigning opportunity owners using a round robin. In order 
for the user to actually view the record, they must be in the user group that is configured 
inside the Opportunity Defaults in the CRM settings.

Chapter 5
173
There is a second logic option for a round robin that is based on ratio. This allows for a 
"weighted" assignment giving more new opportunities to users than others:
To streamline the sales process, opportunities can be created with certain products 
and/or subscriptions pre-populated as the possible sale. These interest bundles can be 
configured in the CRM settings:
The option beneath the Interest Bundle dropdown can be used to prevent duplicate 
opportunities from being created. An opportunity is considered active if one exists in the 
stages defined as so in the CRM settings. If this is checked, a new opportunity will only be 
created if another opportunity doesn't already exist in one of those active stages:

Selling with a Sales Team
174
Since an opportunity record will display on the user's calendar, we can use Next Action Date 
to empower future sales automatically; leads will magically "appear" in a sales rep's pipeline. 
We could have also used a Delay Timer of 60 days then created the opportunity with Next 
Action Date of 0 for the same effect. The difference would be having the opportunity hit their 
pipeline immediately with a future date, or having the opportunity hit their pipeline at day 60:

Saving time with FAQ workflows
Quite often in business, there are Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that must be 
answered. A novel way to save time, get organized, and grow sales is by automating those 
types of e-mails.

Chapter 5
175
Normally, each time one of those questions is asked, someone has to manually type the 
answer and send it. A savvier business may have a swipe file of common answers that can 
be copied/pasted to save time.
This recipe leverages the power of a note template to automatically trigger a pre-authored 
e-mail answering a common question.
Getting ready
We need to be logged into Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and inside the 
campaign builder.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new note template goal, a new sequence, and connect; rename accordingly:
2.	 Double-click on the note template goal and configure with the appropriate context; 
click on the green Save button:

Selling with a Sales Team
176
3.	 Double-click into the sequence and drag out a new Email step; rename accordingly:
4.	 Double-click into the e-mail and write the answer to the frequently asked question:
5.	 In the upper-right of the page, click on Draft to change the e-mail to Ready; 
click on Back to Sequence.
6.	 In the upper-right of the page, click on Draft to change the sequence to 
Ready; click on Back to Campaign.
7.	
Publish the campaign.

Chapter 5
177
How it works...
When someone asks the frequently asked question, a user can simply apply the FAQ note 
template to automatically send the e-mail and save time while also leaving a clean digital 
paper trail.
There's more...
There may be certain times where following up on an FAQ can be beneficial, but also a very 
low-priority to-do. If there are any links within the automated e-mail, we can leverage a link 
click goal to provide a world-class experience:
The name of the note template goal will display for the end user. To group similar note 
template types, use prefixes so they are easy to find:
The Action and Type dropdown options available when setting up the note template can be 
configured in the CRM settings. This can be useful for reporting on certain note behavior.

Selling with a Sales Team
178
By default, the user who applies the note template is credited as applying the note in the 
contact record. However, we can change who the note is assigned to in the note template 
configuration. The same functionality exists within a Note step inside a sequence as well:
When configuring a note template, we can also trigger an e-mail notification to a user every 
time the note template is applied:
Think of a note template as a big red automation button. When we need something 
automated that we know Infusionsoft can do (send an e-mail, HTTP Post, and so on) but aren't 
quite sure HOW to trigger the automation, a note template is a quick fix.
Although this recipe is for an FAQ specifically, this tactic can be used for any type of common 
automation. Some common prefixes for names are:
f
f
ADMIN - : For notes related to administrative automation
f
f
CUSTOMER - : For notes related to customer automation
f
f
FINANCE - : For notes related to financial automation
f
f
LEAD - : For notes related to lead development automation
f
f
SALES - : For notes related to sales automation

Sending automated appointment reminders
Scheduling an appointment with someone is useless unless the appointment actually occurs. 
We can improve our chances of the appointment occurring by sending automated reminders 
leading up to the appointment date.
This recipe is about building a workflow tool that can easily be operated after a user has put 
the scheduled appointment in their appropriate system of existence (online calendar, offline 
calendar, mobile device, and so on).
Getting ready
We need to be logged into Infusionsoft and inside a specific account. Also, inside the 
campaign builder we should have:
f
f
A custom Date type field for the scheduled appointment
f
f
A custom Text type field for the appointment time
How to do it...

How it works...
When someone submits the LEAD - Schedule Appointment internal form, the system will 
send an immediate confirmation e-mail and then schedule an e-mail reminder for the 
morning before the appointment.
There's more...
As of this writing, a custom Date/Time field is not usable in a Field timer; this is why 
we needed to separate the appointment date and time into two custom fields.
Although it won't work in all cases, keeping a low-key friendly tone for these e-mails 
can encourage a conversation before the appointment. If the e-mails look or sound too 
automated it won't be an enjoyable experience.
To help with appointment stick rates, include appointment-specific instructions or other 
resources that would be helpful in the initial confirmation e-mail. We can get really fancy 
by tracking click behavior on those resources with a link click goal and provide a more 
intimate pre-appointment experience:
Voice broadcasts can also help with appointment stick rates if used strategically. They can 
also be a very handy reminder when someone needs to bring certain items to a meeting:

Selling with a Sales Team
184
As long as the date is stored within the contact record, this tactic can be extended for 
sending reminders around any critical date. The system comes out of the box with a 
birthday and anniversary date on the contact record that can be used to provide 
world-class customer experiences.
Although it doesn't display in the form builder, with the Date type field for appointment, 
the end user will have a calendar picker available and all the keyboard shortcuts work.
To minimize wasted time from missed appointments, we can include an I need to reschedule 
link in the reminder e-mail and use a link click goal to create a task to reschedule. For a great 
end user experience, include the exact name of the internal form that needs to be submitted 
upon a successful reschedule in the task body:
There are certain third-party plugins that can generate a "humanized" date to merge into 
communications besides the formal MM/DD/YYYY presentation. These plugins can be found 
in the Infusionsoft Marketplace.

Merging custom opportunity fields into 
e-mails
It is possible to merge opportunity field information into an e-mail communication.
For the context of this recipe we are assuming a sales pipeline with a stage named 
Appointment Scheduled and we are going to send an e-mail with the opportunity's 
next action date and time when a prospect is moved into that stage.

How it works...
When a sales rep moves an opportunity into the Appointment Scheduled stage, Infusionsoft 
will immediately send an e-mail merging in any inserted opportunity information from that 
specific opportunity record.
There's more...
The Pipeline Automation trigger will fire every time the stage move conditions are met. 
For this recipe, every time the prospect is put in the Appointment Scheduled stage from 
some other stage, the e-mail will be sent.
This functionality can be handy when using custom opportunity fields to store critical 
information about the potential sale or complex fulfillment data.
Although it won't work in all cases, keeping a low-key friendly tone for these e-mails can 
encourage a digital conversation between voice-to-voice interactions. If the e-mails look 
or sound too automated, it won't be a good experience.
We can also automate when someone moves out of a pipeline stage. This can be useful for 
controlling automated campaigns. For example, turning off a long-term nurture campaign 
when someone leaves an In Long Term Nurture stage. The recommended tactic is to set 
up a Pipeline Automation trigger that applies a functional tag associated with a tag goal in 
the long-term nurture campaign.
Someone can have multiple sales opportunities throughout the course of their lifetime, 
hence a contact record can potentially have more than one opportunity associated with it. 
The Pipeline Automation triggers are able to pull information from the opportunity that 
triggered it, no matter how many opportunities exist. This is also why we cannot merge 
opportunity information into a campaign builder communication. The campaign builder 
operates at the level of contact record and, as of this writing, is not able to distinguish 
which opportunity specifically triggers a stage move goal.

Chapter 5

This recipe can be used to easily send a branded Buy Now e-mail because that is an available 
opportunity merge field. In that case, we would need to set up a sales stage for the purpose 
of triggering a Buy Now e-mail.
If we create a new e-mail template from the Billing Automation triggers, we have credit card 
information that can be merged into an e-mail. This is primarily used to provide credit card 
update functionality. The Update merge fields operate similar to a Buy Now link except the 
link will drive to a page where the recipient can update a Credit Card record:

Setting up lead scoring
For organizations that are opportunity heavy, it can sometimes be hard for sales reps 
to know whom they should reach out to first. This is especially true when a sales rep 
has a large number of opportunities with a next action date for today.
To help identify which prospects are the most engaged, and so should be reached out 
to first, Infusionsoft has the ability to do lead scoring.
For the context of this recipe, we want to be scoring leads based on the following activity:
f
f
Form submissions
f
f
E-mail opens
f
f
Link clicks
f
f
E-mail unsubscribes
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and at the bottom of the CRM column, 
click on Settings.
2.	 In the Contact & Company Settings menu on the left of the page, click on Scores:

Selling with a Sales Team
194
3.	 In the Name & Status section, give our lead scoring rules a name and make sure 
lead scoring is turned on:
4.	 Set a value of 50 for how many points equals 5 flames:
5.	 In the Rules section at the bottom, click the options to configure a rule for if a 
contact's activity contains Web Form Submission; award 25 points:
6.	 Hover to the right of the row containing the rule and click on the + sign to add a 
new rule:

Chapter 5
195
7.	
Configure this new rule for if a contact's activity contains Email Open; award 5 points:
8.	 Click on the + sign to add another rule and configure it for if a contact's activity 
contains Link Click; award 10 points:
9.	 Click on the + sign to add another rule and configure it for if a contact's activity 
contains Email Unsubscribe; award -100 points; click on the green Save button 
at the bottom of the page:

Selling with a Sales Team
196
How it works...
As a contact engages with our marketing through different types of behavior, Infusionsoft 
will award points based on the rules outlined. The total number of points is then weighted 
against the value set for 5 flames to determine a contact's lead score. For example, since the 
maximum points in this recipe is set to 50, if a lead has 30 points, they will display 3 flames 
on their record. Looking at this contact's record, in the upper-right of the General tab it will 
look like this. The Score is also displayed in the right side of the page when looking at an 
opportunity record:
There's more...
Web Form Submission, Email Open, and Link Click award lead score points for each unique 
instance of that action. For example, if someone opened two different e-mails, they would 
receive twice the points. However, if they opened the same e-mail multiple times, they would 
only receive points for the first open of that e-mail.
When designing your lead scoring rules, be sure to leverage negative engagement types 
(like we did with the Email Unsubscribe) to push weak leads to the bottom. This is where 
tag-based lead score rules can become very handy.
We can also assign lead scores based on specific tags being applied. Multiple tags in a 
rule are using OR logic:

Chapter 5
197
In other words, it doesn't matter if someone has one or more of the potential tags as they 
will only receive the lead score points once. If we need points for each tag, we would need to 
create a unique rule for each tag.
For dynamic lead scoring (sometimes known as a decaying lead score), we can have lead 
score points expire after a certain number of weeks:
The name we configure at the beginning of this recipe is how it will display when filtering 
contact or opportunity records:

The Update recent activity option enables lead score transitions to be shown in the Recent 
Activity widget on a user's dashboard:

For how to automate based on a certain lead score being achieved, see the next recipe, 
Automating based on lead score achievement.
Automating based on lead score 
achievement
Once we have lead scoring set up, we can also automate based on a contact achieving a 
certain lead score.
For this recipe, we are going to send the opportunity owner, in this case a sales rep, an e-mail 
notification when one of their leads achieves the highest lead score possible (5 flames).
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and inside a new campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a lead score goal and a sequence; connect as shown in the following image 
and rename accordingly:

Chapter 5
199
2.	 Double-click on the lead score goal to configure it.
3.	 Configure the goal for when the score increases to 5 flames; click on the green 
Save button:
4.	 Double-click into the sequence and add a new e-mail step; rename accordingly:
5.	 Double-click into the e-mail to edit it.
6.	 Configure the e-mail to come from a no-reply address and to the owner using the 
available merge fields:

7.	
Compose a message with information that the sales rep needs to act 
upon immediately:
8.	 In the upper-right of the page, click on Draft to change the e-mail's status to 
Ready; click on the Back to Sequence button in the upper-left of the page.
9.	 In the upper-right of the page, click on Draft to change the sequence's status 
to Ready; click on the Back to Campaign button in the upper-left of the page; 
publish the campaign.
How it works...
As a contact engages with our marketing through different types of behavior, Infusionsoft will 
award points based on the rules outlined. When the contact reaches the lead score configured 
in the lead score goal, the assigned user will receive an immediate e-mail with instructions to 
reach out to the contact.

Chapter 5
201
There's more...
The ~Contact.EditPage~ merge field used in the preceding example will populate as a 
link to the contact's record. Upon clicking, the user will need to log in if they are not already, 
and be taken right to the person's record. This allows for proper pipeline management even 
on the go.
If we are using expiring lead score points, a contact's score may fluctuate up and down 
over time. If we need to make the lead score automation happen repeatable with a looping 
structure that sandwiches a sequence between two lead score goals, configure with the 
same settings:
We can also configure a decreasing lead score goal for early risk detection and 
re-engagement:
For more advanced lead score automation, we can develop a pyramid-shaped model that 
ascends up to 5 flames, and then descends down to none. This way, we can create a 
personalized experience as someone's lead score fluctuates up and down. Jordan Hatch, a 
world-renowned Infusionsoft expert, is credited with discovering this particular structure.
The left side of the pyramid is modeled as follows:

Building a long-term prospect nurture
To close out this chapter on selling with Infusionsoft, we are going to implement a strategy 
ensuring that if someone is not ready to buy now, they don't slip through the cracks and 
become a totally lost prospect. After all, just because they don't buy now, doesn't mean they 
can't in the future.
The high-level strategy behind a long-term prospect nurture is to reach out every once in a 
while with a small bit of value and make it easy for the person to request a phone call.
For the context of this recipe, we are going to be building a six-month nurture that delivers 
three quality online resources. Of course, this recipe is easy to extend longer depending on 
the nature of our customer's buying cycle.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and inside a new campaign. 
In addition to this, we are assuming:
f
f
An In Long Term Nurture stage exists
f

1.	 Drag out two stage move goals, a link click goal, and two sequences; connect as 
shown in the following image and rename accordingly:
2.	 Create a campaign merge field for the title of each nurture resource:
3.	 Create a campaign link with the URLs of each nurture resource:

click on the Back to Sequence button in the upper-left of the page.

30.	Using the menu on the left of the page, select each nurture e-mail and select 
the link in the P.S. on the right of the page. Make sure all e-mails with a P.S. 
are being tracked and click on Back to Campaign:

31.	 Double-click the notify owner sequence and add a new e-mail step; rename 
accordingly:

address and to the owner using the available merge fields:
33.	Compose a message with information that the sales rep needs to act 
upon immediately:

36.	Double-click on the second stage move goal and configure for when moving out of the 
In Long Term Nurture stage; click on the green Save button:
37.	 Publish the campaign.
How it works...
When a user moves a prospect's opportunity into the In Long Term Nurture stage, the prospect 
automatically receives communications for the next six months. In each communication, the 
sales rep is providing them with something of extreme value while also making it easy for the 
prospect to request a call. If the prospect requests a call by clicking the link in the P.S. of each 
e-mail, the sales rep is automatically notified and can continue working the opportunity. To 
ensure a great customer experience, whenever their opportunity stage is moved the nurture 
sequence is automatically stopped.

Chapter 5
213
There's more...
Add a P.P.S. link to allow people to drop out if they are no longer interested:
Use a link click goal to track this behavior so we can notify the owner to move the opportunity:
If we can, mix up the types of resources we share. Different people respond to different 
kinds of content so make sure we have a healthy mix of written word, spoken word, videos, 
and presentations.
Mix up the time of day you deliver the resources. Feel free to experiment with sending on 
weekends since these e-mails should be pure valuable content. Remember, the high-level 
strategy is to make it easy for people to bubble up. It is entirely possibly that your offering 
would only be seen when they check their e-mail over the weekend because they are 
overwhelmed during the week.
Mix up the communication channels. As long as the Return On Investment (ROI) is there, 
we can send direct mail pieces at certain steps in the nurture. In that case, make sure 
there is still an easy mechanism for the prospect to respond to the mail piece.
This strategy can also be initiated from other mechanisms besides opportunity stage moves. 
An internal form, a note template, an API goal, or a tag goal can just as easily trigger this 
nurture campaign.
This strategy can also be expanded for customer nurture as well. In that case, we may also 
choose to use a purchase goal to trigger the campaign.

The third phase of lifecycle marketing is Wow. This chapter concerns itself with different

There is a general flow to the recipes and, while each can stand by itself, a new business 
would be advised to start at the top and work their way down.
If a small business were to implement every recipe in this chapter, I feel very strongly that 
their business would not only earn more per customer, but the costs to acquire a customer 
would go down because the automated systems would support a completely delightful 
experience—an experience they would surely tell their friends about.

Segmenting by last purchase date
When we can segment our customer database based on someone's most recent purchase, 
it unlocks an entire world of automation potential.
This information can be used to plan promotions, automatically switch paths, or simply 
enhance an existing report for a deeper layer of insight.
This type of segmentation cannot easily be performed retroactively, so the sooner a 
business implements this recipe, the sooner they begin building their lake of data.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and in a new campaign. 
We also need to have:
f
f
The shopping cart configured or a live order form
f
f
The last purchased segments we want to track created as tags, for example


Last purchased -> within 30 days


Last purchased -> within 30-90 days


Last purchased -> within 90-180 days


Last purchased -> within 180 days-1 year


Last purchased -> over 1 year ago

2.	 Double-click on the first purchase goal and configure it for Any Purchase; 
click on Save:
3.	 In the lower-left corner of the second Purchase goal, click on the green symbol 
to open the goal settings.
4.	 Using the This goal can be achieved by... dropdown, select Any Contact; click 
on Save:
5.	 Double-click on the second purchase goal and configure it for Any Purchase; 
click on Save:

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
218
6.	 Double-click into the sequence and add two Tag steps:
7.	
Double-click into the first Tag step and configure it to apply the first purchase 
segment tag; click on Save:
8.	 Double-click into the second Tag step and configure it to remove all the other 
purchase segment tags; click on Save:

Chapter 6
219
9.	 Drag out a new Start Timer, Delay Timer, and two Tag steps.
10.	 Double-click on the timer and configure it to wait as long as the first segment and 
then run on any day at 12 AM; click on Save:
11.	 Double-click into the first Tag step and configure it to remove the first purchase 
segment tag; click on Save:

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
220
12.	Double-click into the second Tag step and configure it to apply the second purchase 
segment tag; click on Save:
At this point, we may want to leave canvas notes to track the 
different segments.
13.	Repeat this Start - Delay - Tag switching structure for each of the remaining 
purchase segments:

Chapter 6
221
14.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
15.	In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish 
the campaign.
How it works...
The first time someone makes a purchase, they are tagged with the first purchase segment 
and then the tags switch as time passes. If they make another purchase, the second purchase 
goal will pull them out of the sequence and then the first purchase goal will add them back 
into the sequence. When this happens any previously applied tags will be removed and the 
first purchase segment tag is reapplied. To ensure that this always happens, we set the 
second purchase goal as an entry point.

This timer is tracking any purchase. We can easily modify this model to time-specific product 
purchases and re-purchases.
The magic of this recipe lies in the fact that we can sandwich a sequence between two of 
the same goals and create a looping effect. We can also create loops with:

Building a new customer welcome campaign
Anytime a customer receives their product or is delivered a service, we have an opportunity 
to make them feel appreciated and increase the chances of future business. By making that 
appreciation known over time, we greatly increase the chances of future business.
While a welcome campaign can use many different communication channels, for this recipe, 
we are only going to be contacting the customer via e-mail.

How it works...
When a customer makes a purchase through the shopping cart (or using an order form), they 
receive an immediate thank you e-mail. One week later, they get another e-mail with more 
resources, and one month after their purchase, they are invited to follow on a social channel.
There's more...
Don't forget to add any Tag steps to switch out a contact's tags! For example, we may want to 
remove specific prospect tags and apply customer tags.
Don't forget to include any necessary fulfillment information in the initial welcome e-mail or 
fulfillment tasks in the sequence. For example, if there is a physical product being shipped, 
we may want to include some expectations around estimated delivery times.
Depending on the specific business, we may want to communicate at different frequencies 
than this recipe. For example, an annual service may wait a full quarter after the initial 
welcome e-mail.
This recipe is a generic new customer welcome that will work for a majority of products/
services. For maximum effectiveness, add extra steps based on the company's strategic 
objectives. For example, a business that relies heavily on repeat purchases could have a 
welcome that lasts a year and provides a special offer or discount for another purchase. 
Or, for a business that relies heavily on word-of-mouth referrals, we might introduce a social 
invitation much earlier.
If our business is not using the shopping cart or order forms, we can trigger this campaign 
manually with a note template.

Creating a customer satisfaction survey
When we understand how satisfied (or not) a customer is, we can adjust the customer 
experience to ask for a testimonial/referral or take steps to make things right. One way to 
acquire this information is with a customer satisfaction survey.
A customer satisfaction survey can be requested for each purchase, after a general period of 
time (for example annually) or a customer interaction. It all depends on the specific business.
For the context of this recipe, we are creating a survey for a recently purchased product.

32.	In the upper-right side of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
33.	In the upper-left side of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish 
the campaign.
How it works...
When a customer clicks through to the web form from an e-mail, their e-mail address will 
prepopulate in the hidden field, so when they submit their feedback, Infusionsoft knows who 
is submitting the form. If they are satisfied, we automatically ask for a testimonial. If they are 
neutral, we automatically inquire into what wasn't working. If they are not satisfied, someone 
is tasked with contacting the customer to make things right.

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
236
There's more...
We can easily drive traffic from other campaign e-mails to this survey using Hosted web 
form links:
We can add-on an invite sequence that is triggered via tag to standardize how surveys are 
administered. This makes it easy to request a survey from any campaign; just apply the 
functional tag when it is time to ask for feedback:
We can also use a full landing page instead of a web form for a richer survey experience.

Chapter 6
237
Rather than providing a dead end, use the momentum from a form submission to drive 
customers somewhere on the thank you page:
For a more human experience, add a Delay Timer before any of the automated e-mails:
The logo shown in the preceding example is one of the select special characters supported by 
the form builder. They can be accessed from the Insert tab at the top of the toolbar.
Add an internal form after the Not Satisfied sequence to track the resolution of 
unsatisfied customers:

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
238
We may choose to add tags for their current satisfaction status. Tagging can create more robust 
automation experiences by providing an opportunity for campaign switching using decision 
nodes looking for certain tags. However, if the satisfaction-level tagging is only being done 
for reporting, we can keep the database lean and use campaign reporting instead:
We can add a general survey link into the footer of our standard customer e-mail template to 
create a steady stream of feedback over time.
Asking for testimonials automatically
Social proof is one of the most persuasive tools for marketing. When potential customers can 
read about another customer's experience in their own words, it greatly increases trust in our 
products or services.
Having a system to automatically ask for testimonials can provide us with a steady stream of 
social proof that can be used throughout our marketing efforts.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and in a new campaign. In 
addition to this, we also want to have a functional tag created to trigger the testimonial request.

them accordingly:

How it works...
When another campaign applies the functional starting tag, the customer receives two e-mails 
asking for a testimonial. If someone provides a testimonial from the first e-mail, the second 
request e-mail will not be delivered.

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
246
There's more...
We can use a custom Text Area field, which provides a larger space to write:
Include a checkbox, so people can opt-out of having their testimonial published:
Use this checkbox to segment which testimonials are okay to use in your marketing and follow 
up accordingly:
We can also use a full landing page instead of a web form for a richer testimonial 
collection experience.

Chapter 6
247
Rather than provide a dead end, use the momentum from a form submission to drive 
customers somewhere on the thank you page:
Out of the box, this recipe will only ask for a testimonial once unless the functional tag is 
automatically removed. This automated removal means another campaign could trigger 
the sequence again in the future.
Setting up a birthday collection mechanism
When we have a person's birthday on file, it enables us to build goodwill by providing timely 
birthday messages. Combined with other data it can be used to provide a more targeted 
experience. For example, if we have the birthday of someone who is not yet a customer, 
we might send them a birthday discount in an attempt to get that first purchase.

customer receives two e-mails asking for their birthday. If they haven't provided their birthday 
by the beginning of the New Year, at the start of the next year, they receive a reminder to 
share it. When someone does provide their birthday, they are tagged accordingly, so this 
data can be leveraged to segment in other areas, such as a campaign or a report.

How it works...
When another campaign applies the functional tag, the person will receive an e-mail on the 
morning of their birthday every year. At any point, a user may apply the note template to 
cancel any scheduled birthday messages.
There's more...
The removal and reapplication of the functional tag fires both tag goals at the same time. 
However, due to the mechanics of the builder, the second tag goal will trigger the first tag goal 
(the stopping goal), which will take them out of the sequence as Done. Next, the first goal will 
trigger (the start goal) and, since they are Done with the sequence, they will re-enter and thus 
be scheduled for next year's birthday e-mails.
We reapply the tag one day later. Otherwise, if we tried in the same day, the sequence steps 
would be skipped because the "next birthday" would be in the past and the loop would only 
run once.
This recipe can be an easy extension to the previous birthday collection recipe. Simply apply 
the birthday schedule tag in the post web form sequence:

Chapter 6
265
To create a more unique experience, do birthday promotions at odd times. For example, 
we can do a low-cost half-birthday gift:
Use the last purchase tags for a highly targeted birthday e-mail experience:

Wowing New Customers with Great Experiences
266
We can also choose to remove the functional tag if a user applies the note template; just 
add a sequence after it and remove the tag. This recipe leaves the tag on to prevent other 
campaigns from adding them again in the future. A tag apply step will not fire a tag goal if 
the contact already has the functional. Removing the functional tag creates the possibility 
that someone will be re-added to the birthday e-mails after we manually stopped them.

Introduction
This chapter concerns itself with different tactics to Wow your existing customers.
There are two main reasons you want to completely to blow your existing customers socks off. 
First, it is much cheaper to make another sale to an existing customer compared with acquiring 
a brand new customer. Second, and similarly related, is that customers tell their friends 
about your customer experience no matter what. Their experience will come into conversation 
organically at some point in their life. You might as well do your best to ensure that when they 
inevitably talk to their friends, they only have the finest things to say about your business.

Updating a soon-to-be-expired credit card 
automatically
Collecting overdue payments can be expensive and time consuming. An innocent reason 
for the card on file to fail is simply that it has expired. By automatically giving customers 
the opportunity to update a card, we can provide a better customer experience and lower 
operating costs.
This recipe is primarily intended for companies that sell using subscriptions or payment plans.

How it works...
When a customer has a card on file that is scheduled to be billed in the future, 30 days before 
that card's expiration an e-mail will be sent. The update link in the e-mail allows the customer 
to update the credit card record on their own and prevent automated billing interruptions.

Chapter 7
273
There's more...
Credit card merge fields are available because we are editing an e-mail within the context of a 
credit card expiring trigger:
The billing trigger considers the card's official expiration date as the first day of the following 
month after expiration. For example, if a card expires in January 2015, and the trigger is set 
for 7 days, it will be delivered 7 days before February 1st.
We can also apply a tag in the expiration trigger to trigger a campaign:
Since billing triggers deal with e-commerce experiences, Infusionsoft knows which credit card 
record it should be pointing to through the update link. However, the campaign builder is not 
able to discern which credit card record caused the tag to be applied. This means the update 
links will fail if manually typed into a campaign builder e-mail; any follow-up should be using 
other channels:

There are some esoteric yet very powerful automation triggers available to track update 
e-mail interactions. In the E-Commerce settings, under the Order Settings menu, there 
is an Orders section:
Just above the Notifications section midway through the page, we have an automation 
trigger for when someone clicks on an update link and when someone successfully 
updates their card:
If we configure those triggers to apply a tag, we can automatically control card 
expiration campaigns:
We can create a follow-up sequence using more than one billing trigger or tag. In this case, 
we want to make sure to remove any functional tags immediately, so the campaign will 
always fire for any expiring card:

Re-engaging inactive e-mails in your 
database
Just as a gardener is used to trimming away leaves from their flowers, list attrition is part of 
the e-mail marketing game. There are lots of people that say, The money is in the list. While 
this is partially true, the money is actually in the relationship with the list.
When we are talking about an e-mail list, especially if that is the main communication 
channel, it is critical to regularly find inactive e-mail addresses and attempt to get them 
engaging again.
This is important for two reasons. First, it obviously helps the bottom line to have an active 
e-mail list. Second, it helps with inbox placement with the major ISPs. Spam filters are getting 
more advanced and when lots of e-mails are sent but never opened or clicked (among other 
things), it can cause a high junk folder placement.
For the context of this recipe, we are targeting people on the general newsletter list who 
haven't clicked anything in the past 120 days.

Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign. 
We also need to have a functional tag created to trigger the re-engagement; we are also 
assuming a tag for the newsletter segment of the database exists.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a tag goal, a link click goal, and three sequences. Connect and rename 
accordingly The decision node will appear after connecting the form to the 
second sequence:
2.	 Double-click on the tag goal.
3.	 Configure it for the functional tag and click on Save:
4.	 Double-click into the Still Interested sequence.
5.	 Add a tag step, three Email steps, and three Delay Timers. Connect and rename 
them accordingly:

6.	 Double-click into the Tag step and configure it to remove the functional tag. 
Click on Save:

Double-click into the first e-mail step and write a message thanking the person for 
being on the newsletter, addressing their lack of activity and then asking them to 
indicate if they want to continue or not:

run on a weekday at 8 AM. Click on Save:
15.	Double-click into the second e-mail step and write a message thanking the person for 
being on the newsletter, addressing their lack of activity again, and asking them to 
indicate if they want to continue or not. We also need to configure the two thank-you 
page links, as we did in steps 8 to 12:

17.	 Double-click on the second Delay Timer and configure it to wait one week and then 
run on a weekday at 4 PM; click on Save:
18.	Double-click into the third e-mail step and write a message addressing their lack 
of activity again, alerting them that we will automatically remove them and then 
asking them one last time to indicate if they want to continue or not. We also 
need to configure the two thank-you page links, as we did in steps 8 to 12:

run on a weekday at 8 AM; click on Save:
21.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
22.	In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign.
23.	Double-click on the Stay on List goal.
24.	 Using the list of e-mails on the left, click into each e-mail and select the appropriate 
links in each e-mail; click on Back to Campaign:

30.	In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
31.	 In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish 
the campaign.
How it works...
When the functional tag is applied to a contact, they are added into a three e-mail 
re-engagement campaigns that run over 3 weeks. If they never click on anything, at the 
end of those 3 weeks, they will automatically have the newsletter tag removed. If they 
click on any of the options, they will immediately stop receiving those e-mails.
There's more...
This campaign can be run manually by a user for a group of contacts periodically, or it can 
be used in conjunction with other campaigns that are timing inbox engagement.
If possible, we would want to segment out prospects from customers and deliver a slightly 
different message to each group:

Building a Vaynerchuk opt-out
The strategy behind this recipe was inspired by a gentleman named Gary Vaynerchuk; hence, 
his name is used.

Chapter 7
285
His idea was, after people have opted out from e-mails, to call them on the phone, apologize, 
and listen. This kind of experience, when done properly, can actually have people ask to 
re-join the list.
It is very easy to build a mechanism like this using Infusionsoft.

How it works...
When someone opts-out from the database entirely and they have a phone number on file, 
Infusionsoft will create a task for someone to call that person and find out what happened.
There's more...
We are using inverse logic to check for the presence of a phone number. In plain English, 
the rule says if there are NO empty fields, run the actions.
Take this experience to the next level by creating an internal form that users should complete 
after making the call. This can empower further segmentation based on the different 
outcomes, such as rejoining the list or provided valuable feedback.
Setting up a basic referral partner program
Infusionsoft has a built-in referral partner (affiliate) module on certain versions of the software. 
This makes it easy for a business to track who is referring whom. Also, if orders are being 
recorded inside Infusionsoft as well, it empowers the automatic calculation of commissions.
There are two components that must be set up before we start adding referral partners:
f
f
Commission program: This is where we tell Infusionsoft how much to pay out for 
specific products and subscriptions
f
f
Referral tracking links: This is where we can set up different URLs for our referral 
partners to promote

Chapter 7
291
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account. For this recipe, we are 
also assuming the following:
f
f
We already have a product created that we want to pay 50 percent commission on
f
f
We have at least one URL that referral partners can drive traffic towards
How to do it...
1.	 In the upper-left corner of the page, hover over the navigation and in the CRM 
column, click on Referral Partners:
2.	 When the page loads, hover over Referral Partners in the menu and click on 
Commission Programs:

Commissions, type the product we need commissions for and select it when it 
appears; use the Subscription Plan section if we are paying commissions on a 
recurring product:

10.	 Hover over Referral Partners in the menu and click on Referral Tracking Links:
11.	 Towards the right of the page, click on the green Add a Referral Tracking Link button:

Chapter 7
295
12.	Give the link the following:


A name; this will be visible to referral partners


A short code


The web address where referral traffic should redirect to


Select the programs that can use this particular link
13.	Click on the green Save button.
How it works...
When a referral partner is added to the IS Cookbook program, two things will happen. 
First, when they log in to the referral partner backend, they will be able to generate their own 
trackable link to the landing page provided. Second, if someone clicks through that link and 
eventually purchases through an order form or the shopping cart, the referral partner will 
receive commissions for that order.

Wowing Existing Customers with Great Experiences
296
There's more...
For most business models, we only want to pay a referral partner for traffic they provide 
towards a certain product (or family of products). There are certain instances where we 
would want to pay the referral partner for anything we sell to someone. In these cases, 
we can set the default commissions:
Certain products and subscriptions warrant a full commission payout even if there is a 
payment plan. For example, a high-priced consumer good that gets paid over 6 months. 
In these cases, we have an option when setting a commission override to award commission 
as soon as the order is created, regardless of when the actual payments arrive:
Since a referral partner can be in multiple commission programs, the priority helps 
determine the commissions when a referral partner is getting paid for the same product 
in two different programs. For example, if a referral partner receives 50percent of Widget 
A sales in one program, but 25 percent of Widget A sales in another program, the program 
with the highest priority is what gets paid out. In this case, the lower the priority number, 
the higher it is (that is, a program priority of 1 will pay out over a program priority of 3):

Chapter 7
297
As a business grows its network of referral partners, it is entirely possible for someone to click 
through more than one partner's links. In this case, who gets the sale credit? The answer to 
this question is actually a CRM setting. Under the Referral Partner Defaults submenu, there 
is a dropdown where you can assign which referral partner gets credit in these situations:
Just under this First referring and Latest referring setting, there is a setting that empowers 
an extra tab of information on the contact record:

Wowing Existing Customers with Great Experiences
298
When we select Referral history and cookies and save the page, this adds another tab to the 
second row of the contact record:
Infusionsoft supports a nested referral partner network up to grandparent level. In other 
words, with three levels, if a referral partner can recruit another partner, and THAT partner 
gets someone under them too, the original partner can potentially receive commissions:

Chapter 7
299
Promotional Resources are optional. If configured, they will display when the referral partner 
is logged in to the backend portal. This allows us to provide to our referral partners prewritten 
e-mails which can be used for promotions, banner ads, and pages inside the backend portal 
that can contain nearly anything. For example, we could create an e-mail template, a related 
banner ad and then create a page explaining how the referral partner should structure those 
resources for maximum effectiveness:

recipe early in Chapter 4, Selling Products Online and Getting Paid.
This recipe simply lays the groundwork for a referral partner program. While we can manually 
add referral partners, the next recipe, Building a referral partner sign-up form, allows people 
to add themselves to our programs and effectively automate the process.
Building a referral partner sign-up form
Once our referral partner commissions and links are set up, we can begin manually adding 
referral partners and sending them their login information.
However, we will save a bunch of time if we give people a web form where they can sign 
themselves up to be a referral partner.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign. 
We are also assuming that a commission program has been created already.

Referral Partner record and connects it to their contact record. When the system sends the 
welcome e-mail, it will merge in the information from this Referral Partner record.

subdomain is the correct app name.
The login URL is https://APPNAME.infusionsoft.com/Affiliate/.

Introduction
Infusionsoft isn't only great for taking someone from a new lead and turning them into a 
raving fan, but it can also be used for different administrative functions.
The recipes in this chapter are very helpful for maintaining a clean organized database and 
systematizing critical business processes.

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
308
Reconciling hard bounced e-mail addresses
When an e-mail bounces, this means it was not delivered for one reason or another. There 
are different kinds of bounces for different situations. A hard bounce means the e-mail 
address flat out doesn't exist. Think of it like a Return to Sender when trying to send 
something in the post to an address that doesn't exist.
There are many reasons why a once-valid e-mail address stops working. However, just 
because an e-mail stops working doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and continue a 
relationship with the person.
Unfortunately, most businesses don't place a high priority on contacting and recovering a 
working e-mail address. This can result in false list statistics. For example, if we have 100 
people but 15 are hard bounced, we really only have 85 people who can be reached via 
e-mail. Not only does this bad data throw off reporting, it can also lead to a bloated and, 
effectively, useless database.
The good news is that with Infusionsoft, we can automatically catch e-mails when they hard 
bounce and assign a task to someone to contact the person to collect a working e-mail.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign. 
We also need to have a functional tag created.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a tag goal, an internal form goal, and a sequence; connect and rename 
them accordingly:

Chapter 8
309
2.	 Double-click on the tag goal and configure it for the functional tag; click on Save, 
as follows:
3.	 Double-click into the sequence and add a task and a Tag step:
4.	 Double-click into the Task step and configure it with instructions for someone to 
contact the person and collect a working e-mail address:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos

5.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the task as Ready and 
click on Back to Sequence in the upper-left corner.
6.	 Double-click into the first Tag step and configure it to remove the functional tag; 
click on Save:
7.	
In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
8.	 In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign.
9.	 Double-click into the internal form.
10.	 Add a Title snippet and provide some instructions for the user who will be submitting 
the form.
11.	 Remove all fields except for an Email field:
12.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the internal form as Ready.
13.	In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish 
the campaign.
14.	 After the campaign has been published, in the upper-left corner of the page, click on 
Back to List.

Chapter 8
311
15.	Hover over the main navigation menu and in the Marketing column, 
click on Settings:
16.	 In the Template Settings menu on the left-hand side, click on Email Status 
Automation, as follows:
17.	 Using the Choose Trigger Type dropdown, select When an email bounces and click 
on Add Trigger. This will open a pop-up window, as shown in the following image:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
312
18.	Configure the trigger for when the bounce type is field to hard bounce and set the 
and the email has bounced dropdown to at least 1 time:
19.	Using the Actions dropdown beneath the trigger criteria, select Add/remove tag:
20.	Configure the action to apply the functional tag and click on the green Save button:

Chapter 8
313
21.	 Click on the Save Trigger button to close the window, as shown here:
How it works...
Whenever Infusionsoft sends an e-mail and it returns as a hard bounce, the functional tag 
will automatically be applied, which triggers the recovery campaign. When a user submits the 
internal form to update the e-mail address, the bad e-mail on file will be overwritten.
There's more...
There are many different bounce types, and we can create different experiences depending 
on the situation:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
314
Not all contacts will have a phone number on file. To make sure we don't waste time, 
we can make the functional tag application based on a rule that checks for the presence 
of a phone number:
The rule itself would need the following configuration:

Tracking e-mail engagement levels
When we can segment our database based on someone's engagement with your e-mails, 
it unlocks an entire world of automation potential.
This information can be used to plan promotions, automatically switch paths, or simply 
enhance an existing report for a deeper layer of insight.
This type of segmentation cannot easily be performed retroactively, so the sooner a 
business implements this recipe, the sooner they begin building their pool of data.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign.
We also need to have some tags created:
f
f
Three tags to track the engagement levels: hot, warm, and cold
f
f
One functional tag that will trigger/reset the previously mentioned engagement tags
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out two tag goals and a sequence; connect and rename them accordingly:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
316
2.	 Double-click on the first tag goal and configure it for the functional tag, which will 
start the tracking; click on Save:
3.	 In the lower-left corner of the second tag goal, click on the purple symbol to open 
Goal Settings.
4.	 Using the This goal can be achieved by... dropdown, select Any Contact and click 
on Save:

Chapter 8
317
5.	 Double-click on the second tag goal and configure it for the same functional tag as 
the first tag goal; click on Save:
6.	 Double-click into the sequence and add two Tag steps, as follows:
7.	
Double-click into the first Tag step and configure it to apply the Hot engagement tag; 
click on Save:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
318
8.	 Double-click into the second Tag step and configure it to remove all the other 
engagement tags and the functional tag; click on Save:
9.	 Drag out a Delay Timer and two new Tag steps:

Chapter 8
319
10.	 Double-click on the timer, configure it to wait 30 days, and then run on any day at 12 
AM; click on Save:
11.	 Double-click into the next Tag step and configure it to remove the Hot tag; click 
on Save:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
320
12.	Double-click into the last Tag step in the chain and configure it to apply the Warm tag; 
click on Save:
13.	At this point, we may want to leave canvas notes to track the different segments, 
as follows:
14.	 Repeat this Delay - Tag switching structure for the remaining Cold tag, as shown in 
the following image:

Chapter 8
321
15.	On the upper-right side of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready.
16.	 On the upper-left side of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish the 
campaign.
17.	 In our other e-mails throughout Infusionsoft, anytime there is a meaningful link that, 
when clicked, means the person is engaged, apply the functional tag:
How it works...
The first time someone clicks on a link that auto-tags them with the functional tag, they are 
tagged as Hot and then the tags switch as time passes. If they click on another link that 
applies the functional tag in the future, the second tag goal will pull them out of the sequence 
and then the first tag goal will add them back into the sequence. When this happens, any 
previously applied tags will be removed and the Hot tag is reapplied. To ensure that this 
always happens, we set the second tag goal as an entry point.
There's more...
In this recipe, we are switching tags every 30 days. However, depending on the business, 
we may want to extend or shorten the tag-switching cycle.

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
322
These tags can be used in conjunction with lead scoring to help sales representatives 
find out who is the most active and thus should be contacted first:
We may also want to add a Super Hot tag that is only present for a short period of time. Again, 
this can help sales representatives find out who is in front of their e-mails right now and 
therefore might be a great person to call right now since we know they are active:
Tracking engagement levels is a pretty good stat for the dashboard. All we have to do is create 
a saved contact search for each tag and then put them into a Custom Statistics widget on 
the dashboard:

Those are the kinds of employees that can cause all sorts of problems in many different 
areas of the business.
In fact, even considering them for an interview is a big waste of time.
Fortunately, with Infusionsoft, we can create a simple hoop for a new applicant to jump 
through to make sure that they can follow basic instructions. The idea behind this recipe 
is to position the initial application submission as a two-step process, where the applicant 
has to confirm their e-mail address in order to reach step two.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a web form, a landing page goal, an e-mail confirmation and two sequences; 
connect and rename accordingly:
2.	 Double-click on the Task to Contact sequence at the end of the chain.

49.	In the upper-left corner of the page, click on Back to Campaign and publish the 
campaign.
How it works...
When someone applies, they will submit the first web form, which sends them an e-mail 
confirmation. Upon confirming their e-mail address, they will receive an e-mail immediately 
linking them to the part 2 landing page. We will only receive a task to contact the applicant 
if they complete part two, thus saving us time interviewing people who cannot follow 
basic instructions.
There's more...
We can extend this recipe to fully systematize the hiring process with some additional 
internal forms after the part 2 landing page.

If we are hiring for different positions, we can clone this recipe and create a hiring funnel for 
each position being offered.

Creating a true e-mail preferences center
The e-mail subscription management options available out of the box with Infusionsoft are 
limited because they do not show current subscription status.
Traditionally, Infusionsoft users use tags to track someone's e-mail subscription. However, 
if we use a custom field to track subscription status, we can build a web form that operates 
like a true e-mail preference center.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a new campaign. 
In addition to this, we also want to have a dropdown-type custom field created to track an 
e-mail subscription status with two values: Yes and No.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a web form and rename it accordingly:
2.	 Double-click on the web form to edit it.
3.	 Remove all fields from the form.

Chapter 8
335
4.	 Add a Logo and Title snippet; update the text to indicate that this is an e-mail 
preference center:
5.	 Using the Field Snippets tab, drag out a Hidden field.
6.	 Using the Which Field dropdown, select Email; leave the field value empty and 
click on Save:
7.	
Using the Field Snippets tag, drag out an Other field.

336
8.	 Using the Which Field dropdown, select the custom field we are using to track this 
particular e-mail subscription; mark the field as Required and click on Save:
9.	 Click on the Submit button to change the call to action.
10.	 Change the button label to Update My Preferences, center align the button, and 
click on Save:

Chapter 8
337
11.	 Our web form should now look like a basic subscription management page as follows:
12.	At the top of the page, click on the Thank-you Page tab.
13.	Modify the thank you page content to indicate that the contact has just updated 
their preferences:
14.	 At the top of the page, click on Settings.
15.	Verify that Auto-populate has its option selected:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
338
16.	 On the upper-right side of the page, click on Draft to mark the form as Ready; on the 
upper-left side of the page, click on Back to Campaign.
17.	 Publish the campaign.
18.	The next time we send a newsletter, include a link to this Hosted web form in the 
footer:
How it works...
When someone clicks on the link to manage their e-mail preferences, the form will 
prepopulate the contact's e-mail in the hidden field as well as the current value for the 
subscription custom field. If they make any changes and submit the form, their record will 
reflect their preferences.

Chapter 8
339
There's more...
If we have more than one subscription, we can include them all on the preference form. 
However, we may want to strategically create one preference form per subscription, depending 
on the business:
We can add extra options to the dropdown values to give further communication control or 
allow people to select their preferred frequency:

Using lead sources to track ROI
There is a fairly popular John Wanamaker quote floating around the Internet that reads 
as follows:
"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which 
half."
What he is referring to is his inability at the time to track which marketing assets were 
providing a return on the investment.
Fortunately, thanks to Infusionsoft, we can track the cost for different lead sources, 
which can be used for native Return On Investment (ROI) reporting right in the software.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation, and in the Marketing column, click on Lead 
Generation:

Chapter 8
341
2.	 In the Lead Sources section, click on Create Lead Source:
3.	 Give the new lead source a name and a description and then click on the green 
Save button at the bottom of the page:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
342
4.	 After the page reloads, click on the Expenses tab at the top:
5.	 Click on the Add Expense button:
6.	 Log the cost for this particular lead source and click on Save:

Chapter 8
343
7.	
We will now see this cost in the Recent Expenses section at the bottom of the page:
How it works...
When someone has this lead source on their contact record as well as an order recorded, that 
will populate in the ROI reports:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
344
There's more...
The ROI reports can be found in the Marketing reports:
When contacts have this lead source, the Expenses tab will give an overview of the number 
of contacts and cost per contact in the upper-right corner of the page:
It is recommended to take full advantage of the Category, Vendor, Medium, and 
Message/Content fields in the lead source. This empowers better reporting and deeper 
insights. This is particularly helpful when we have different variations of marketing 
messages as it allows us to quickly see which ones are performing best:

Chapter 8
345
When a lead source is no longer relevant, we can set it as Inactive. This prevents future 
contacts from being added to the lead source accidentally by an end user; inactive lead 
sources are not visible when manually selecting a lead source for a contact. This can keep 
our list of lead sources clean while retaining all historical data for reporting:
If a certain lead source has a fixed monthly expense, we can create a recurring expense that 
will add to the cost progressively each month until the end date. This allows us to create a 
rolling ROI since the expense is dynamic over time:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
346
We can add a hidden Lead Source field to any web form or landing page to ensure that new 
contacts will be properly sourced:
We can also drive different traffic sources to the same web form/landing page and 
dynamically pass different lead sources through the URL. This way, it is easy to test different 
variations of a particular marketing message without having to create a unique web form/
landing page for each variation.
To do this, we need to have a hidden Lead Source field with an empty value. Then, when 
linking to the web form/landing page, we can append ?inf_field_LeadSourceId=xx 
to the URL where xx is the lead source ID.
This only works when driving traffic to the JavaScript version of a web 
form or a hosted landing page because those have a built-in function 
to prepopulate form fields from URL parameters.

Managing campaign model variations with 
versioning
An esoteric function of the campaign builder is the ability to save different campaign model 
configurations. This can be helpful when reusing common elements of a campaign but other 
elements change. For example, seasonal promotions or a product launch.
It is also helpful when innovating and improving an existing model. It allows us to safely 
make changes to the model that can be rolled back if necessary.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and in a particular 
campaign.
For this example, we are going to show how a product that is only sold twice a year, 
during the winter and during the summer, can be easily updated for the season.
The campaign model we are going to start with looks like this, and we will be updating it for 
the winter season:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
348
How to do it...
1.	 Using the Campaign dropdown in the upper-left corner of the page, click on 
Save Version:
2.	 Click on OK on the confirmation message dialog box:
3.	 Update the campaign model with the changes we need; be sure to retain any 
sequence content that we will want to reuse in the future.

Chapter 8
349
4.	 Using the Campaign dropdown in the upper-left corner of the page, click on Save 
Version.
5.	 Finish the campaign. Publish and use it.
6.	 When it is time for the summer season, using the Campaign dropdown in the upper-
left corner of the page, click on Restore Version:
7.	
Click on the version we want to restore; this will restore the campaign model for the 
summer version:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
350
How it works...
Saving a campaign version takes a snapshot of the campaign model structure, including all 
the structures within a sequence. When we restore a campaign, it loads this structure as it 
was when the version was saved.
There's more...
Campaign versioning does NOT include the sequence step content; it only includes the 
sequence layout. For example, if we make changes to an e-mail's content and then restore 
to an older version, it will restore the sequence layout but still retain the current e-mail 
(assuming that the same e-mail object is in the older version). This is why it is recommended 
to disconnect but not delete any sequence content that we plan to reuse. Cloning sequences 
can be very handy in these situations.
A campaign version is generated automatically whenever a campaign is published. We can 
tell which versions were automatically created because they will be accredited to the system 
instead of a specific user.
There is a similar restoration function available within an Email step:
When using the Revert Changes function, it will restore the e-mail content to whatever was 
present upon first opening the e-mail; this was the last saved state for the content. Please 
be aware that previewing an e-mail does save the e-mail content on the backend so it can 
be displayed. Hence, if you have previewed an e-mail since opening it, the Revert Changes 
function will restore the content to the last time it was previewed.

Adding groups of contacts to a campaign 
sequence
Most campaigns start when someone performs a particular action such as filling out a web 
form. However, there are certain situations where we need to manually add a group of contacts 
to a particular campaign sequence, such as a product launch to the existing list of customers.
Getting ready
We need to have a campaign already published and a list of contacts we want to add into it.
How to do it...
1.	 Perform a contact search for the group of people we want to add into the campaign.
2.	 Using the Actions dropdown, select Start/Stop a Campaign Sequence:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
352
3.	 Using the dropdown menus, select the Campaign and the specific sequence within 
the campaign we want to add this list of contacts to:
4.	 Click on the Process Action button.
How it works...
This function adds the list of contacts to the campaign sequence specified, thus launching the 
campaign.
There's more...
This function can also be used to stop a specific campaign entirely, we just have to select Stop 
in the first dropdown:

Checking for duplicate contact records
Ideally, every human will only have one contact record in the database. In the real world, this 
doesn't always happen. This can lead to strange experiences such as an existing customer 
receiving a promotion for a product they have already purchased. Needless to say, this doesn't 
enhance customer experience.
Fortunately, Infusionsoft has a built-in function to check for duplicate contact records.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and in the Admin column, select Data Cleanup:
2.	 Click on Check for Duplicate Contact Records:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
354
3.	 On the screen that explains how duplicate checking works, click on the green 
Next button at the bottom of the screen; it is recommended to stop and read how 
duplicate checking works.
4.	 Using the radio options, select Check all records. (May take a long time). and click 
on the green Next button:
5.	 On the next page, scroll down and ensure that all Stages are checked and 
click on Next.
6.	 On the alert that displays, click on OK to begin the deduping process:

Chapter 8
355
7.	
As the deduping occurs, we will see a status bar; this may take a while depending on 
the amount of contacts being checked:
8.	 When the deduping is done, we will get a confirmation message:
How it works...
This function uses the built-in deduping logic inside Infusionsoft to generate a list of contact 
records it believes may be duplicates.
There's more...
It is highly recommended to perform a duplicate check (and reconcile any duplicates found) 
after importing a list of contacts to minimize spam complaints from accidentally sending the 
same e-mail multiple times to a single person.

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
356
It is recommended to check for duplicates periodically, say every quarter. To save system 
resources, we can only check records that haven't been checked already:
We can further speed up the duplicate checking process by searching across fewer fields. 
In particular, unless the business makes heavy use of phone numbers or addresses, 
we can perform a satisfactory duplicate check just against an e-mail alone:

To learn how to merge duplicate contact records discovered by this function, see the next 
recipe, Cleaning up duplicate contact records.
Cleaning up duplicate contact records
The previous recipe will only return a list of contacts the system thinks may be duplicates. 
It is still necessary to merge any duplicate records found.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft , inside a specific account, and have already 
performed a duplicate check.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and in the Admin column, select Data Cleanup:

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
358
2.	 Click on View Duplicate Contact Records:
3.	 On the duplicate results screen, in the left column, click on Manual Merge.
4.	 This will display three columns. The left and right columns will show the available 
data in the duplicate records.
5.	 The center column consists of the data that will be merged into the resulting contact 
record. We can click on the arrows either side of this column to move data:

Chapter 8
359
6.	 When we have selected the data to be merged into the resulting contact record, at 
the bottom of the page, click Merge & Return to Search:
7.	
On the alert that displays, click on OK to merge the records and return to the list of 
potential duplicate contacts:
How it works...
This function takes the two contact records and merges them into one with the data that was 
selected. It will merge all associated data, including tags, notes, orders, and so on.
There's more...
Occasionally, we will have good information for the same field such as two working phone 
numbers. To avoid losing data, it is recommended that we copy the good data into our 
clipboard and then after the merge, place the data in another field (for example, Phone 2). 
The Merge & View Contact button at the bottom of the page makes this very easy.
There are certain instances where a contact record is actually not a duplicate. For example, it 
is very possible to have two different John Smiths in the database. In this case, we can click 
on Mark as Not Duplicates to keep the two records separate and prevent them from being 
flagged as duplicates in the future.

Administrative - Conquer Internal Chaos
360
If a lot of duplicates are found, there are ways to automatically merge contact records in bulk:
The Merge Duplicate Contact Records By Overwriting Old Data With New Data option will 
overwrite any fields on the older record (based on when it was created) with the fields from 
the newer record. The Merge Duplicate Contact Records By Only Adding New Data, Not 
Overwriting Old Data option will only fill in fields that aren't present in the older record. For 
example, if both records have an e-mail address but the old record doesn't have a phone 
number and the new one does, the phone number will be in the merged record while retaining 
the older e-mail address. While these functions are convenient, for the most reliable data 
integrity, it is preferred to perform the manual merge as outlined in this recipe.

Collecting W-9 forms from referral partners 
automatically
To close this chapter, we're going to explore how to automatically collect necessary tax 
documents from our referral partners. Since the author is American, this recipe is going to 
be for a U.S. tax form, but the recipe will work for any tax document in any country.
Specifically, we are going to be collecting a W-9 form.

Chapter 8
361
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft , inside a specific account, and inside a new 
campaign.
We also need to have a functional tag created to trigger this particular campaign.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag out a new tag goal, note goal, and sequence. Connect and rename 
them accordingly:
2.	 Double-click on the tag goal and configure it for the functional tag; click on Save:

8.	 Configure the link for a direct download to the W-9 form and click on Insert/Update; 
this can easily be found by searching online:

click on Back to Sequence.
10.	 Double-click the first Delay Timer, configure it to wait 1 week, and then run on any 
weekday at 8 AM; click on Save:

Chapter 8
365
11.	 Double-click on the second e-mail step and write a reminder message about the W-9 
form and include another call to action to download the form and send it back:
12.	Configure the download link with the W-9 form URL, as we did in step 8.
13.	In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the e-mail as Ready and 
click on Back to Sequence.

14.	 Double-click the second Delay Timer, configure it to wait 1 week, and then run on any 
weekday at 8 AM; click on Save:
15.	In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the sequence as Ready 
and then click on Back to Campaign.
16.	 Publish the campaign.
How it works...
When the functional tag is applied to a referral partner's contact record, they will automatically 
receive an e-mail asking for the tax form. If a user does not apply the Admin note indicating 
that the form has been returned, the referral partner will receive a reminder e-mail after 
one week.
There's more...
To fully automate this process, it is recommended to apply the functional tag after someone 
signs up to be a referral partner.
At its core, this recipe is a document collection strategy, which means that it can be used to 
collect any type of document, not just tax forms.

Introduction
In the book A Scandal in Bohemia, Sherlock Holmes states that:
"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to 
twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."
At its core, Infusionsoft is a database, which means our business is swimming in an ocean 
of valuable data. The purpose of this chapter is to empower us to fish for meaningful insights 
that we can use to drive business decisions. This way, we can make informed and educated 
decisions as opposed to just guessing.
Creating a saved search or report
One of the most valuable skills we can develop as an Infusionsoft user is knowing how to 
properly search for and display meaningful data. There are two ways we can search through 
the database. We can do a direct query on the different tables (contacts, opportunities, 
orders, and so on) or we can use the built-in reports that come out of the box.
The good news is that no matter which method we use, the process to search, display, and 
save such data is the same. Hence, while this recipe will demonstrate a specific search 
example, we can extend these ideas to any data inquiry.
Specifically, this recipe will search for a group of contacts with a specific tag and then save 
it for quick access in the future.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation menu and in the CRM column, click on Contacts. 
If a previous search is displaying when the page loads, click on the Start Over 
button at the top of the list, as follows:

3.	 In the tabs at the top of the search options, click on Columns:
4.	 The Custom Columns: box on the left-hand side is the data that will be displayed 
upon performing the search. To show more data, select the data field we want to see 
in the box on the right-hand side and click on the << symbol between the boxes:

9.	 Give this search a name and click on the green Save button:
10.	 The next time we want to access this saved search, we can use the dropdown in the 
upper-right corner of the page:
How it works...
The search filter criteria and data fields selected make up a saved search or report. From 
here, we can use this saved search to customize our dashboard, send automated e-mails to a 
user with the search results, or run mass actions.

There's more...
The word report is sometimes a misnomer when searching for data inside Infusionsoft. 
The list of contacts we generated in this recipe could colloquially be referred to as a newsletter 
subscribers report, but in actuality, it is just a straight database query. Reports, formally, are 
ways to manipulate data (such as an opportunity stage move conversion percentages) or 
access data that isn't a standard record type (such as a campaign's performance). It is an 
important skill for an Infusionsoft user to know when to do a search and when to use a 
formal report. For example, if we wanted to find a report of all the sales opportunities that 
are overdue, we would simply do an opportunity search with the Next Action Date criteria 
for dates in the past.
We can raise a direct query on the following record types:
f
f
Contacts
f
f
Companies
f
f
Opportunities
f
f
Referral Partners
f
f
Orders
We can also perform a search on e-mail broadcasts by clicking on any option in the 
Marketing menu and then hovering over Email & Broadcasts:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
376
We can also perform a search on subscriptions by clicking on any option in the E-Commerce 
menu and then hovering over Orders:
The different reports for the various sections of Infusionsoft can be accessed by hovering 
over the main navigation menu and clicking on the Reports link in the footer of each section. 
Searching and saving these reports functions in the exact same way as doing a direct 
database query. It is highly recommended to spend some time becoming familiar with the 
different reports available for the different sections.
When selecting the data fields to display, we can control the order they display by using the 
arrows to the right of the field:

Chapter 9
377
We can also select how the data should be sorted upon search by using the dropdowns at the 
bottom of the Custom Columns tab:
After the search has been performed, we can typically click on the data header to sort by that 
column; certain data types don't have this sorting functionality:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
378
If we have a search that we plan to access often, after saving it, we can use the Options 
dropdown to add it to our favorites:
Clicking the Add to Favorites... option will open a pop-up window where we can configure 
how it will be displayed in the Your Favorites menu:

Chapter 9
379
Upon clicking Save, we will be able to quickly access it from the Your Favorites menu in the 
navigation:
By default, any saved searches or reports can only be seen by the user that created them. 
However, there is a Share/Unshare... option that allows us to share what we create 
with other users:
After performing a search or a report, depending on the record type being queried, we will 
have a list of actions that can be performed on a group for records. It is highly recommended 
that you become familiar with the different actions available for the different record types.

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions

For example, these are the available actions when searching contact records:

Note how some of the options change if we do an opportunity search that consists of specific 
actions related to certain sales pipeline functions:

Adding custom statistics to your dashboard
Now that we know how to create saved searches and reports, we can add those directly to our 
dashboard. However, there are certain situations where seeing the full details is unnecessary.
This recipe is going to cover how we can take a saved search or report and display it as a 
statistic on the dashboard for faster consumption.
As with the previous recipe, while we are going to cover a specific example, the process 
to create a custom statistic is the same regardless of the search or report being used.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and have a saved 
search available.
How to do it...
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the navigation, hover over the house symbol and click 
on Dashboard:

Chapter 9
383
2.	 In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, click on Add Widgets:
3.	 To the right of the Custom Statistics option, click on Add to Dashboard, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
4.	 Using the second dropdown, select the record type containing the saved search, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
384
5.	 Using the third dropdown, select the saved search we want to display, as follows:
6.	 Give the stat a meaningful title and click on Save:

Chapter 9
385
7.	
This will display the custom statistic based on the saved search:
How it works...
The Custom Statistics widget loads the saved search in the background and then displays a 
count of the number of records found. This will work for any saved search or report.
There's more...
By default, the Custom Statistics widget performs a count of the records. However, there are 
four other types of statistics that can be leveraged:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
386
If we choose one of the other options, we will also have to select which data field we want to 
perform the calculation on:
This is one way to easily keep track of vital e-commerce data:

Chapter 9
387
We can have as many Custom Statistics widgets on our dashboard as we want. To keep 
them organized, we can rename the different widgets using the Rename function at the top 
of each one:
If we are running calculations on a saved report, we will have to select the Saved Report radio 
button when configuring the statistic in order for the relevant reports to be selectable:
A Custom Statistics widget can have up to 10 stats per widget.

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions

We can use the same search or report for more than one statistic:

Configuring your dashboard
Now that we know how to create saved searches/reports and how to create custom statistics 
from those, we can now learn how to configure our dashboard.
Infusionsoft's dashboard can be extremely powerful when we configure it for critical business 
information. It should be thought of as ground control for our business, displaying important 
metrics and vital signs.
Since every business is different, this recipe is going to cover the different functionality 
available to set up and organize our dashboard.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.

How to do it...
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the navigation, hover over the house symbol and click on 
Dashboard.
2.	 In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, click on Change Layout.
3.	 Select the dashboard layout we want to use by clicking on Use This. It is 
recommended to use the biggest layout, so we have the most room to display critical 
information:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions

4.	 To organize the different widgets, we can drag and drop the widget's title for better 
placement:
5.	 To add more widgets, we can click on Add Widgets in the upper-right corner of the 
page and then click on Add to Dashboard:
How it works...
The dashboard can contain a variety of widgets to provide valuable insights into our business.
There's more...
Each dashboard is configured at the user level. When adding a new user, it is recommended to 
log in with them and help them configure their dashboard for their roles and responsibilities. To 
save time, as the admin, we can build any relevant saved searches or reports and share them 
with different users before doing this. See the There's more... section of the first recipe in this 
chapter to learn how to do this.
If we want to display the details of a particular saved search or report, we can use the 
Saved Search or Saved Report widget:

Chapter 9
391
We can also add a saved search or report directly to our dashboard when we save it:
If we are using fulfillment lists that are going to a user, we need to use the Fulfillment Jobs 
widget for those jobs to display and be properly worked:
It is recommended to add every widget to your dashboard, so we can become familiar with 
how each one operates. While we won't necessarily use every widget, and we can delete 
them afterwards, it is a wonderful learning exercise to become fully versed in the dashboard's 
capabilities.

Setting a user's default start page
There are many different options that can be configured for each user. One of the lesser 
known abilities is the option to set which page displays upon logging in. This can be a massive 
time saver, especially for those users who log in multiple times a day.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the navigation, hover over the person symbol and click on 
Edit My Profile, as follows:
2.	 In the tabs at the top of the page, click on Preferences:

Chapter 9
393
3.	 In the Misc section, next to the Default Start Page setting, select the radio button for 
what we want to display upon login; click on Save at the bottom of the page:
How it works...
This setting controls what a user will see upon logging in.
There's more...
We can make any main navigation item display upon loading by selecting the My Nav (top link) 
option. This will load whichever menu option is configured at the top of the My Nav section of 
the navigation:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
394
If we want a page to load that is not available in the main navigation, we can select the 
custom option and configure it for the URL of the page we want. To do this, go to the page we 
wish to load upon login and then set the Custom option as everything after the .com in the 
URL.
For example, if we wanted the subscription search to load upon login, we would set the 
custom value as /app/nav/link?navSystem=nav.accounting&navModule=order&na
vLink=search-subscription:
Automating saved search or report delivery
There are certain scenarios where receiving a saved search or report automatically via e-mail 
can be beneficial. For example, a saved search for all opportunities with a Next Action Date of 
today.
One of the most esoteric functions of a saved search/report is the ability to automate the 
sending of it to a user on a particular schedule.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and looking at an existing 
saved search or report.
How to do it...
1.	 Using the buttons at the top of the search/report, click on Options and then Email 
saved search.... This will open a pop-up window:

Chapter 9
395
2.	 In the list box of days, select the day(s) we wish to receive the automated e-mail. Hold 
the Ctrl key and click to select multiple days:
3.	 Click on the green Save button.
How it works...
On the morning of the days that have been selected, the user will receive an e-mail with the 
saved search/report results.

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
396
There's more...
To prevent inbox bloat, we can select Yes on the Only Send When Results Found option. This 
will ensure that an automated e-mail is only sent if the particular search/report returns results 
for that day. For example, if we want a saved search of opportunities with Next Action Date in 
the past, but there are none, this would prevent a useless e-mail from being delivered.
This function is performed per user, so if we want more than one person to receive it, each 
user must have access to the saved search/report and perform this recipe.

Building the perfect sales rep dashboard
Opportunities inside Infusionsoft are, in the author's opinion, one of the most powerful tools 
available to not only drive sales, but provide valuable insights into what it is working and what 
isn't in the sales process.
In order to ensure that nobody slips through the cracks, there is a particular configuration of 
the dashboard for a sales rep that ensures that they can start their day off with focus and 
work the leads that need attention today.
While nothing can ever be perfect, this configuration ensures that a sales rep's dashboard can 
act as a very reliable ground control for them to see exactly how their pipeline is operating.
For this recipe, we will be creating two saved opportunity searches and then configuring the 
dashboard.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account, and should already have 
our opportunity stages configured.

How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and, in the CRM section, click on Opportunities:
2.	 Search with the following criteria:


Search | Stage: All stages selected except win/loss


Search | Owner: Current user
The Search Criteria window will look like this:

9.	 In the Misc Criteria tab, modify this search by setting the Next Action Date Custom 
Interval as 365 days ago and/or -1 days after today and then scroll down and click 
on the green OK button:
10.	 When the search loads (and it may be empty), click on the Options dropdown above 
the results and also click on Save As...; this will open a pop-up window:

Chapter 9
401
11.	 Name the search Overdue Opportunities, select all the users who will be 
working on opportunities, and click on Save:
12.	After the search saves, hover over the house symbol in the upper-right corner of the 
navigation and click on Dashboard:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
402
13.	Using the Add Widgets button in the upper-right corner of the dashboard, add the 
following widgets:


Calendar Items


Pipeline Stages


Tasks
14.	 At the bottom of the Pipeline Stages widget, click on Settings and configure it to 
show only our user's stats, the relevant sales stages, rename it as My Pipeline, 
and then click on Save:
15.	Using the Add Widgets button in the upper-right corner of the dashboard, add two 
Saved Search or Saved Report widgets.

Chapter 9
403
16.	 Configure both widgets for the two saved searches we created earlier in the recipe:
17.	 Click and drag the widgets to organize the dashboard, as shown in the following 
screenshot:

Your Dashboard and Reporting - Make Better Decisions
404
How it works...
Every morning, the sales rep can log in, and the Calendar Items widget will show any 
opportunities with a next action date of today. This should be their focus. Upon completing 
those, they can work on any tasks that may be assigned to them and catch up on any 
overdue opportunities. By following this workflow impeccably, it ensures that no leads will 
ever slip through the cracks.
The right column acts like a 10,000-foot view into the state of their current pipeline.
There's more...
Each sales rep will need to configure their own dashboard. This is why we created the searches 
and shared them with other users, it saves them from setting up the searches on their own. 
A sales rep can follow this recipe starting at step 12 once the searches have been saved.
The Overdue Opportunities saved search is looking for next action dates that are -1 day after 
today, in other words, anything due yesterday or before. Using negative numbers as criteria 
in searches/reports (assuming that the search field is looking for a whole number) is a very 
handy tool to have in our back pocket.
Tasks and opportunities will both show up on a user's calendar. Even though we are showing 
tasks, it is recommended to only use these for secondary or auxiliary action items; the 
opportunity's next action date should always contain the next primary thing that needs to 
occur. For example, if an appointment is scheduled, we can set the next action date as the 
actual appointment and then create a one-off task to send the meeting invitation.

move ahead in the campaign. They did not achieve a goal further down the line, and 
they didn't automatically flow into another sequence. This is the orange number seen 
in the Performance view.

Introduction
Everything in this chapter is officially unsupported and should any of the recipes in this 
chapter break, Infusionsoft support cannot help you!
Sorry for yelling, just wanted to make it clear that the recipes in this chapter are definitely use 
at your own risk. Now, while these hacks have been working for a while, there is no guarantee 
that they will continue to work. For all of these, we'll absolutely want to test thoroughly after 
configuring to ensure that it still works on our implementation.

Pushing the System with Hacks

When these masterful tricks are wielded properly, they can create world-class automated 
experiences, the kinds of thing that will cause our peers to inquire "How did you do that?".
Creating a custom confirmation link inside 
campaign builder
When confirmation links (formerly known as double opt-in links) were introduced to the 
campaign builder, the functionality was heavily restricted to prevent abuse of the new 
confirmation system. Primarily, the ability to control what the link text actually says, and 
what contacts see upon confirming, were both uneditable.
This hack uses a legacy merge field to insert custom confirmation links into a campaign 
builder e-mail.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and in the Marketing column click on Settings:
2.	 In the Marketing Settings menu on the left-hand side of the page, click on 
Automation Links:

Chapter 10
419
3.	
In the Confirmation Links section, click on the Create Confirmation Link button.
This will open a pop-up window:
4.	
Give the new confirmation link a meaningful name:

Pushing the System with Hacks
420
5.	 Scroll down the page and in the Link Text field, type the text you wish to be 
hyperlinked when the recipient receives the confirmation e-mail. Then click 
on the green Save button:
6.	 When the page reloads, make note of the confirmation link ID in the window's URL. 
Once we have the confirmation link ID, we can close the window:

Chapter 10
421
7.	
Go into an e-mail step within campaign builder.
8.	 At the appropriate point in the e-mail, manually type in the merge field ~OptIn_xx~ 
where xx is the confirmation link's ID:
9.	 Finish the e-mail and mark it as Ready, mark the sequence as Ready, and publish 
the campaign.
How it works...
When a contact receives this e-mail, they will see a working confirmation link in place of the 
merge field, containing the text we set in step 5 hyperlinked.

422
There's more...
To quickly check whether we have entered the merge field properly, we can preview the e-mail 
using the Email dropdown in the upper-left corner of the e-mail builder. If the confirmation link 
text displays properly, the link has been properly configured:
If we wish to automate based on a contact clicking on this confirmation link, we are unable to 
use a link click goal: it will not track legacy links. However, when configuring the confirmation 
link after we have the link ID, we can configure an action to apply a functional tag:

Chapter 10
423
From there, we will want to add a tag goal to remove the contact from the custom 
confirmation sequence:
Using the tactic mentioned earlier, we can create an automated confirmation follow-up 
in case the contact doesn't confirm their e-mail address right away:
We also have some control over what a contact sees upon confirming their e-mail address. 
After we have the link ID, we can click on the Confirmation Page Appearance tab at the top 
and customize the experience:

While this confirmation page does support HTML, it is a direct violation of 
Infusionsoft's acceptable use policy to automatically redirect from this page 
using a code snippet. This kind of behavior will get an Infusionsoft app shut 
down quickly, so its not worth the risk!
The Header Color option changes how the required confirmation text displays to the contact:

more customization.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation, and in the Marketing column, click on Settings.
2.	 In the Marketing Settings menu to the left of the page, click on Automation Links.
3.	 In the Update / Opt-out Links section, click on the Create Update / Opt-Out button. 
This will open a pop-up window:
4.	 Give the new opt-out link a meaningful name:

5.	 Scroll down the page, and in the Link Text field, type the text you want the unsubscribe 
link to be hyperlinked with in an e-mail, and click on the green Save button:
6.	 When the page reloads, make note of the opt-out link ID in the window's URL. 
Once we have the opt-out link ID, we can close the window:
7.	
Go into an e-mail step within campaign builder.
8.	 At the appropriate point in the e-mail, manually type in the merge field ~OptOut_xx~ 
where xx is the opt-out link's ID:

9.	 Finish the e-mail and mark it as Ready, mark the sequence as Ready, and publish 
the campaign.
How it works...
When a contact receives this e-mail, they will see a working unsubscribe link in place of the 
opt-out merge field, containing with the text we set in step 5 hyperlinked.
There's more...
To quickly check if we have entered the merge field properly, we can preview the e-mail using 
the Email dropdown in the upper-left corner of the e-mail builder. If the opt-out link text 
displays properly, the link has been properly configured:
If we wish to automate based on a contact opting out, then when we're configuring the opt-out 
link, after we have the link ID, we could configure an action to apply a functional tag:

Triggering automation from an e-mail open
Tracking e-mail opens is directly impacted by the recipient's e-mail software, because tracking 
an open can only occur when an e-mail's HTML is loaded.
Not all e-mail software loads the full HTML automatically, so automating based on an e-mail 
open is not super reliable.
Despite this instability in the automation confidence, automating based on e-mail opens can 
still be leveraged by another legacy merge field hack.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account. We also want to have a 
functional tag created for the e-mail open.
How to do it...
1.	 Hover over the main navigation and in the Marketing column click on Settings.
2.	 In the Marketing Settings menu to the left of the page, click on Automation Links.
3.	 In the Automation Link section, click on the Create Link button. This will open a  
pop-up window:
4.	 Give the new link a meaningful name:

5.	 Scroll down the page and click on the green Save button:

10.	 Take note of the automation link ID in the window's URL; once we have the link ID, we 
can close the window:
11.	 Go into an e-mail step within campaign builder.
12.	Using the Snippets tab at the top of the e-mail editor, add an HTML snippet:
13.	In the HTML Code snippet box, type in <img src="~Link-xxxx~" width="1" 
height="1" /> where xxxx is the link's ID. Click on Save:

Pushing the System with Hacks
432
14.	 Finish the e-mail and mark as Ready, mark the sequence as Ready, and return to the 
campaign canvas.
15.	Drag out a new tag goal, rename it and connect it to the sequence containing the 
e-mail we just wrote:
16.	 Double-click on the tag goal and configure it for the functional tag, then click on Save:
17.	 Publish the campaign.
How it works...
When a contact receives this e-mail and their e-mail client loads the full HTML, the functional 
tag will be applied, automating based on the open. This hack places an automation link as the 
source for a 1x1 image in the e-mail. When the image is loaded, it simulates a click, which is 
how we connect the open to a tag application.

To the best of the author's knowledge, this hack was originally discovered and shared with the 
community by Tyler Garns.

Automating based on an e-mail open can be used to strategically ensure important messages 
get read:
In these cases, since it is possible that someone has opened the e-mail previously, we have to 
carefully craft our copy for both people who had opened it, and people who hadn't.
Here is an example of how the login reminder e-mail can read:
When written this way, even if someone already has the recipient's  information, it just seems 
like a nice gesture.
Automation based on e-mail opens should be used carefully because of this lack of 
confidence. If we must have confidence in the automation, a link click goal is more reliable.

If we wish to have a series of e-mails that have automation based on opens, we will want to 
set up each series e-mail with its own open automation structure to ensure clean reporting 
and easy maintenance/improvements:
Sending form submissions to different thank 
you pages based on custom fields
When campaign builder was introduced, it provided the ability to use merge fields on the 
form's thank you page.
This hack uses a simple piece of JavaScript to pull information from a customer merge field 
and redirect based on the fixed possible values.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and a campaign with a web 
form or landing page. We also want to have:
f
f
A custom field created that has fixed values (dropdown, radio button, Yes/No, and so 
on) to control the redirect. In this example, we have a custom dropdown type called 
Subscription2 with two possible values: No and Yes.
f
f
A URL for each different thank you page.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the web form or landing page and go to the Thank-you Page tab.
2.	 Add an HTML snippet.
3.	 In the HTML snippet, write the following and make sure to use the proper merge 
field value and page URLs. Click on Save:

Chapter 10
435
How it works...
This code is a simple switching mechanism. It pulls the value of a custom field with fixed 
values and then checks it against the possible values. When it finds a match, it stores the 
proper URL and then redirects the page to said URL. If no match is found, there is a default 
fallback URL to ensure nobody gets lost.
There's more...
To the best of the author's knowledge, this hack was originally discovered and shared with 
the community by Todd Meyer.
Depending on the person's Internet speed, they may see the form's thank you page briefly.
Any merge field can be used to control the switch, not just custom fields. However, when 
using field types that don't have a fixed number of values, there is a risk someone doesn't 
redirect to the right place.

If we wish to redirect to another page that has the contact's e-mail prepopulated in the 
background of another web form / landing page, we can add an e-mail merge field to the 
redirect URL:
Adding a calendar dropdown to date type 
fields on forms
When a user is filling out an internal form inside Infusionsoft, and they are populating a date 
field, the system shows a calendar picker.
However, if we place a Date type field on a web form, the contact must enter the date in a 
specific format, otherwise it doesn't properly capture the information.
This hack uses a simple piece of JavaScript to add a calendar picker to Date type fields on a 
web form or landing page.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and inside a campaign with 
a web form or landing page. We also want to have a Date type field we wish to use (either a 
default one or custom field).
In this example, we have a custom Date field type named Appointment Date.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the web form or landing page with the date.
2.	 If the Date field isn't already on the form, add it.
3.	 Add an HTML snippet.
4.	 In the HTML snippet, write the following and make sure to use the 
proper merge field value. Click on Save:

How it works...
This code uses a built-in calendar picker from an online Google library and associates it with 
the Date type field.

To check whether we entered the code properly, we can use the test function in the upper-
right corner of the page:
Hiding order forms until a link is clicked
A typical online form goes from a sales page to an order form. This means that someone on 
the sales page has to click a link and then wait for the order page to load. In a world where 
attention is becoming a super rare commodity, page load speed can impact sales.
This hack takes page load speed out of the equation by having the sales page and order 
form all in one. However, when the page loads for the first time, only the sales page portion 
displays. Once someone clicks on the call to action link, the order form reveals itself.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft and inside a specific account. In addition to this, 
we need to have:
f
f
A working order form
f
f
The sales page copy
How to do it...
1.	 Open the order form, and in the tabs at the top, click on HTML Areas:

Chapter 10
439
2.	 In the Custom Header area, write the following, then click on Save:
3.	 Beneath the custom code box, click on Preview and verify that the order form is 
hidden until the link is clicked, as follows:
4.	 Replace the placeholder Your Sales Page HTML with your actual sales page HTML 
and finish configuring the order form.

Pushing the System with Hacks
440
How it works...
This code takes the content and IMAGE sections of the page (order form and logo 
respectively) and hides them upon page load using jQuery. There is also a small function 
that says whenever the element with the name #show is clicked, it should display those 
hidden sections. Finally, the Cart Button link is given the ID #show and points to the anchor 
in the page where the order form starts.
There's more...
This is how the experience works. First, the page loads and we just see the sales page:
After clicking, the theme's logo and order form display:
There are a lot of different parameters for the .show() function in jQuery. This can be used 
to adjust the time to display and other neat things.
Using images as form submit buttons
If we want to spice things up a bit with a really fancy call-to-action button, we can use an 
image as the submit button on a web form or landing page.

Chapter 10
441
This hack uses a simple piece of JavaScript to adjust the CSS of the submit button on a web 
form or landing page.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and inside a campaign with 
a web form or landing page. We also want to have a hosted URL for the image.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the web form or landing page.
2.	 Add an HTML snippet.
3.	 In the HTML snippet, write the following and make sure that the width and padding-
left are set to the image's actual width and that the height is the image's actual 
height. Click on Save:
How it works...
This code adjusts the CSS properties of the submit button by using the image as the 
background image.

For extra impact, use an animated .gif as the call-to-action button.

Making any text a social sharing link
The social sharing snippets in the e-mail builder are powerful ways to give recipients an easy 
way to share an e-mail to their networks. However, we have no control over how these share 
buttons display visually.
This hack uses a hidden system merge field to construct the same link built by those snippets.
In this recipe, we are going to create a link that acts as a Twitter share.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and inside a campaign with 
an e-mail that we wish to insert a social share link into.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the e-mail.
2.	 Highlight the text we wish to make a social sharing link and click on Link in 
the toolbar.
3.	 Set the URL as https://appname.infusionsoft.com/app/
socialShare/~EmailSent.Id~/~EmailSent.PartialHash~/T and click 
Insert/Update.
How it works...
The link we manually build the same link that the system generates on the backend from a 
Twitter social share snippet.
There's more...
To create a social share link for Facebook or Google+, change the end of the link 
to F or G respectively.
This can also be used to link an image as a social share button, which means we can use 
custom graphics for social share calls to action.

Making any link an unsubscribe link
Even with the ability to customize an unsubscribe link, sometimes there are situations where 
the way they display doesn't work, or we wish to use an image as the unsubscribe link.
This hack leverages the same system merge fields as the previous recipe to build an 
unsubscribe link.
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and inside a campaign 
with an e-mail into which we wish to insert the unsubscribe link. In addition to this, we need 
to have a custom unsubscribe link created, and know the link's ID.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the e-mail.
2.	 Insert the unsubscribe link's merge field (more information about this merge in the 
See also section of this recipe).
3.	 Send the e-mail to yourself as a test.
4.	 When it comes in, hover over the link.
5.	 Note the first set of numbers after the link's ID in the URL; this is what we need:
6.	 Right-click on the link and copy the link's URL.
7.	
Open a text editor and paste the link's URL in it. Keep this open.
8.	 Go back to the e-mail into which we wish to insert the unsubscribe link.
9.	 Highlight the text we wish to make an unsubscribe link and click on Link in 
the toolbar.

Pushing the System with Hacks
444
10.	 Set the URL as https://appname.infusionsoft.com/app/optOut/xx/
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/~EmailSent.Id~/~EmailSent.PartialHash~ where xx 
is the unsubscribe link's ID and yy is the hash string we identified in step 5 
(use the text editor to easily copy/paste this value). Then click on Insert/Update.
How it works...
The link we manually built is the same link that the system generates on the backend from 
an unsubscribe link.
There's more...
This can also be used to link an image as an unsubscribe button, which means we can use 
custom graphics for unsubscribe calls to action.
This hack can also be used for update only type unsubscribe links.

function upon right-clicking is different depending on which browser you use.
In Internet Explorer, the specific function name is:
In Firefox, the specific function name is:

In Chrome, the specific function name is:
Once we have built this link, we can save time in the future by storing it somewhere easy 
to retrieve, such as Evernote. Then, the next time we need it, we can jump immediately to 
step 10 and copy/paste it in.

Creating an evergreen sales funnel with an 
expiring offer
When it comes to automated experience design, few things compare to the amazing power of 
an evergreen sales funnel with an expiring offer. We open the cart when someone reaches a 
certain point within a campaign and then close the cart after a fixed period of time. This tactic 
for driving urgency is extremely powerful.
The idea behind an evergreen sales funnel is that the cart opens and closes with respect to 
each individual, as opposed to a classic launch where it opens and closes for everyone at the 
same time.
This hack leverages a merge field behind a link where the field value is dynamic.

Pushing the System with Hacks
446
For this example, we are going to assume that after someone opts in, the cart is open for 7 
days and then closes:
Getting ready
We need to be logged in to Infusionsoft, inside a specific account and inside a campaign. In 
addition to this, we need the following:
f
f
A live sales page/order form
f
f
A cart closed page
f
f
A custom Text field to hold the cart URL
f
f
All sales e-mails written
How to do it...
1.	 Open the sequence, in this example we have three sales e-mails before the 
cart closes:
2.	 Open the first sales e-mail.
3.	 Somewhere in a text object, insert the merge field for the custom field holding 
the URL.
4.	 Highlight the cart URL merge field and copy/cut it:

Chapter 10
447
5.	 Highlight the call-to-action in the e-mail and set the web address as the custom 
field value. Click on Insert/Update:

Pushing the System with Hacks
448
6.	 For all call-to-action links in this e-mail and the others in the sequence, set the 
destination as this merge field.
7.	
Back to the sequence, add a Set Field Value step and rename appropriately:
8.	 Double-click on the Set Field Value step to configure.
9.	 Using the Field Value dropdown, select the custom field for the cart URL:
10.	 Set Field Value as the Cart URL for the active sales page/order form, as follows:

Chapter 10
449
11.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the step as Ready and 
then go Back To Sequence.
12.	At the end of the e-mail flow, add a Delay Timer and another Set Field Value step. 
Rename it appropriately:
13.	Double-click the timer and configure it so that the cart will close at the 
appropriate time:
14.	 Double-click on the Set Field Value step to configure.
15.	Using the Field Value dropdown, select the custom field for the cart URL.
16.	 Set the field value as the URL for the cart closed page:
17.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click on Draft to mark the step as Ready.
18.	Finish the campaign and publish.

Pushing the System with Hacks
450
How it works...
When someone enters the sequence, the cart URL custom field is populated with the value of 
the active sales page. This way, when someone clicks on the e-mail, they will be able to make 
a purchase. After the 7 days, the cart URL field is populated with the value of the cart closed 
page. Now if someone clicks, they will find that the offer has expired.
There's more...
Since the links in every e-mail are pointing to the custom field value, whenever someone 
clicks, they will go to whichever URL is set at that moment in time. Hence, when the cart is 
open, they can purchase because the field value is pointing to the active sales page. When 
the cart is closed, they will see the closed page because the field value is pointing there. 
Even if they go back to old e-mails when the cart was open, because the field value is still 
pointing to the closed page, they still cannot redeem the offer.
We may wish to change the cart URL back to the cart closed URL in the sequence after the 
purchase goal.
This hack only changes the URL inside the Infusionsoft database; there is nothing to stop 
someone from looking back in their browser history and finding the active sales page even 
after the cart has closed.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book, Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL 
Management, in April 2004, and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing highly focused 
books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting and 
customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books give you the 
knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using to get the job done. 
Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have seen in the past. Our 
unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, giving you more of what 
you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern yet unique publishing company that focuses on producing quality, cutting-edge 
books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For more information, 
please visit our website at www.packtpub.com.
Writing for Packt
