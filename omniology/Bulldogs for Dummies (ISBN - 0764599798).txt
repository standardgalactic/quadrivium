Author’s Acknowledgments
When I was young (okay, not so young) and foolish, I thought writ-
ing a book was a solo act. Now that I’ve written a few, I know writing
is the work of an ensemble. 
Special thanks to everyone at Wiley, with huge thanks to Acquisitions
Editor Stacy Kennedy, Project Editor Natalie Harris, and Copy Editor
Carrie Burchfield. You are all fantastic. Another huge thank you goes
to Jennifer Joseph, health chair of the Bulldog Club of America,
whose technical advice was invaluable.
More thanks go to Glenn and Kathy Rea, Bulldog people extraordi-
naire. Glenn was always available to “talk Bulldogs” and let me sift
through hundreds of photographs, so I could pick my favorites for
this book.
Thanks also to Lon DiSunno, Anthony Ficarotta, Dorothy Wysaski,
DVM, and Christine Dresser, DVM, for their help. I’d like also like to
say thank you to Amy Munion, DVM, and the staff at Pet Haven
Animal Hospital.
Thanks and cyber hugs to those on the Dog Writers Association of
America e-mail list for general advice, answers to specific questions,
and moral support.
Thanks to all the breeders, judges, handlers, and exhibitors over
the years who generously shared what they knew, all for the love
of dogs.

Introduction
T
he title pretty much tells you what this book is about: Bulldogs.
My instructions for writing this introduction include the phrase
“what the topic is all about.” That phrase reminds me of the won-
derful BBC series As Time Goes By. One of the characters on the
show wrote a book titled My Life in Kenya, and people constantly
asked him what the book was about, to which he replied, “My life in
Kenya.” So the answer to what this book is about is Bulldogs.
I suppose that the next question is how is the book about Bulldogs.
Well, you won’t find a how-to manual, with step-by-step training
instructions within these pages, but you get a good overview of the
Bulldog — history, development, and temperament.
Why may be the next inquiry. Why write this book? That question
can be summed up in one word: Roscoe. Roscoe, as a stocky red
and white Bulldog puppy, captured my heart. All puppies are usu-
ally adorable, so the allure wasn’t that, although Roscoe certainly
was adorable. He reminded me of an animated parson’s table —
short, stocky, and squarely built. Roscoe didn’t belong to me but to
a neighbor, but he seemed to like me or at least to find me an inter-
esting person worthy of examination. 
The neighbors had an older Labrador Retriever as well as Roscoe,
and he soon established the boundaries with Roscoe. The dogs
stayed in their own yard with their owners with no fence. (They
weren’t allowed outdoors unsupervised.)
Anyway, whenever I came home from the grocery store, the minute I
pulled into my garage, Roscoe would trot over, oblivious to the com-
mands from his owner to return. Bulldogs are very single minded,
and Roscoe seemed to feel that it was his duty to accompany me as I
walked from the car to the house with bags of groceries —back and
forth, three or four round trips, until all the groceries were inside.
Roscoe never wandered off to explore the yard, and he never went
home until I was finished. After the groceries were inside my house,
Roscoe and I walked over to his house together. I said goodbye and
went home, and Roscoe stayed where he belonged. How can you not
love a dog like that?

More about why. My friend was shopping at a flea market and
bought me a small book: The Complete Bulldog: A complete book of
guidance and authoritative information regarding the Bulldog, by
Walter E. Simmonds, written in 1926. The book is less than one
hundred pages but seems to capture the essence of this stocky,
wrinkly breed. I hope I’ve captured some of that same essence in
this book.
About This Book
Anthony Ficarotta, a Bulldog lover, once said to me, “Anyone who
knows everything is stupid.” So keeping that in mind, I won’t say
that this book tells you everything you ever wanted to know about
Bulldogs, but I think that it comes very, very close. I tell you about
personality and temperament, about history and health. I give you
suggestions about finding a Bulldog to join your family and ways to
train and feed your Bulldog. I describe ways to keep your Bulldog
safe and happy.
If you’re thinking about getting a Bulldog, this book helps you
choose a puppy, and if you already have a Bulldog, Bulldogs For
Dummies helps you and your pet live happily ever after.
Conventions Used in This Book
In terms of conventional usage, nothing too unusual stands out.
Organizations that are commonly abbreviated are also spelled out
the first time I use them.
I use italics for emphasis and for key terms.
Boldfaced words highlight the key words in bulleted lists.
Monofont is used for Web addresses.
Another point about Web addresses: When this book was printed,
some Web addresses may have extended to two lines of text. If
that’s the case, no extra characters were added (such as a hyphen
or spaces) to indicate the break. So if you use one of these
addresses, just type the address exactly as you see it in the book,
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.

I hope you read every single word in this book, but it’s not
absolutely necessary. You can get lots of basic information and
never read any text preceded by the Technical Stuff icon. Some of
the Technical Stuff isn’t that technical, and some of it is interesting,
but none of it is a must. Sidebars are another part of the book you
don’t have to read. Sidebars aren’t critical to the text. They contain
bits of trivia and other nonessential text. They may also contain
odd scraps of information that I’ve discovered after 30 years with
dogs. I think that a lot of good reading resides in the sidebars, but
you can skip them and not miss anything essential to your Bully’s
welfare. Sometimes you may even want to skip complete chapters
that aren’t relevant to you. 
Foolish Assumptions
Making assumptions is almost always foolish, and I haven’t made
many except to assume that you, the reader, are interested in
Bulldogs. You may have your first puppy, or you may have had
Bulldogs for years. You may not even have a Bulldog yet but are
reading this book to discover all you can before you bring home
your first Bully puppy.
I have not assumed much, but I have pretended a lot. When writing
about how to choose a puppy, I’ve pretended that you don’t have
one and have never gone through the selection process. Later, I
pretend that you have small children. I pretend that you have
other pets and that you don’t have a veterinarian yet. Even in non-
fiction, I can use make-believe.
For my final assumption, I am going to assume that by pretending,
I’ve covered the topic of Bulldogs thoroughly for you.
How This Book Is Organized
Bulldogs For Dummies has five parts, and each stands alone, so you
can quickly find the section that interests you right now. You don’t
have to read this book in order. Within each part, chapters deal
with different aspects of that “part.”
Introduction
3

Part I: A Bully for You
In this part, I discuss the Bulldog breed and how it developed over
the years. I describe the original function of the Bully and what
Bulldogs are like today. I also compare the different origins of the
breed, from the English Bulldog (the one covered in this book) to
the French and American Bulldogs. You also find the standard for
the breed. Then I talk about getting a puppy versus an older dog
and where to find the Bully of your dreams: a breeder, a pet store,
or a rescue organization.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog
Before you bring your puppy home, do some shopping. Nothing is
more fun than picking out those special food and water dishes, the
perfect bed, the collar, and the lead. I give you suggestions to help
you with your selections and also information on introducing your
puppy to your home, family, and other pets. I also provide both
indoor and outdoor safety tips for your pup.
One chapter is strictly about food, and if your Bully spoke, he’d tell
you to start with that chapter. Dog food has come a long way from
the days when dogs were fed table scraps. The food chapter may
help you decide on the best nutrition for your dog.
Another chapter deals with grooming information. You may think
that grooming isn’t needed with your short-haired Bully, and coat
care is minimal, but those lovely Bulldog wrinkles need attention,
as well as nails, ears, and tail.
Part III: Training, Working, and
Traveling: The Busy Bulldog
Bulldogs are pretty mellow dogs, but even the calmest dog still needs
training. In this chapter, you find information on housetraining your
Bulldog, including crate training, paper training, and litter training.
Then I go over the basics like walking on a lead, sitting, and staying. 
If you want to do additional training, you can read about showing
your dog, competing in obedience or agility, or visiting hospitals and
schools with your Bully. You may read the advice on how to enjoy
travel with your dog and what to do if the unthinkable happens and
your dog is lost.

Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog
Healthy
This part deals with the best ways to give your Bulldog a long and
healthy life. I provide pointers on choosing a veterinarian and dis-
cuss various vaccinations and common diseases. You can also find
information on acupuncture, holistic medicine, homeopathic care,
and chiropractic care.
Common Bulldog health problems are covered in this part, and a
chapter on first aid for dogs may be helpful for you too.
Finally, a special-care chapter for your older Bulldog is included.
Your Bully may need a little more TLC as he ages. You may need a
box of tissues.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part is included in every For Dummies book, and this section
is the part that I always read first. Bulldog resources, ten reasons
not to breed your Bully, and ten of the most important things to do
for your dog are right at your fingertips.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the cute little graphics you find in the left margin. When a
paragraph has something special to say, the icons alert you to the
paragraph. Icons indicate special tips, potentially dangerous items
or information for your Bulldog, items to remember, and technical
information.
This little icon lets you know that a shortcut or an easier or better
way to do something may exist.
Just what it says. These paragraphs are bits of information to
remember to help keep your Bully happy and healthy.
If you don’t read anything else, read these warnings! This icon
alerts you to potential threats to your dog’s health and safety.

You can skip these sections if you want to. Technical stuff can be
very interesting, but you don’t need to know it to raise, and live
with, your Bulldog successfully.
Where to Go from Here
Remember the joke about the two-ton gorilla? The question is
“Where does a two-ton gorilla sleep?”, and the answer is “Anywhere
he wants!” Reading this book is like that. Where do you go from
here? Anywhere you want to! That’s the beauty of the parts of a For
Dummies book: You don’t need to start with Part 1, Chapter 1, and
go straight through to the end. You can read that way, of course,
but you can also skip around. If you’re trying to decide whether a
Bulldog is the right dog for you, start with Chapters 1, 2, and 3. If
you already have your puppy and need information on housetrain-
ing, turn to Chapter 9. If you’re concerned about health issues, read
Chapters 13 and 14. Want to read the official American Kennel Club
(AKC) standard? Start with Chapter 2. More interested in what and
how to feed your Bully? Read Chapter 7.
Or if you’re like me, look at all the pictures first and then read all
the cartoons!
Wherever you start, you’re going to start appreciating the wonder-
ful Bulldog in all his wrinkly glory. I enjoyed writing the book; I
hope you enjoy reading it.

W
hat makes the Bulldog the way he is? What don’t
you know about the breed that you would like to
know? Is a Bulldog right for you? In this part, I ask you to
consider your lifestyle and help you determine whether
the Bulldog is the breed for you. Discover the Bulldog’s
history and read about his physical build and tempera-
ment. If you decide that it’s a Bully and nothing else for
you and your family, I give you ideas on where to ﬁnd your
puppy and how to choose the one who’s right for you.

Chapter 1
Bulldog: A Tough Name 
for a Big Softy
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your Bulldog
 Caring for and feeding your Bulldog
 Being active with your Bulldog
Just the name “Bulldog” conjures up an image of a real tough
guy, and when you put a picture of the dog with the name, you
get an image of a real tough dog. Bulldogs are stocky, sturdy dogs
with a solid, foursquare stance and a face that says, “Bring it on; I
can take it.” All those wrinkles and that pushed-in nose give an
impression of gruffness and a ready-to-fight attitude. No wonder
the Bulldog is the mascot of the United States Marines!
The English Bulldog was unofficially adopted as the Marine Corps
mascot during World War I, when the German army reportedly
nicknamed the attacking Marines Teufelhunden, meaning “Devil
Dogs.”
Yet in spite of that face and sturdy body, today’s Bulldog is a
sweetie — a real softie with no hard feelings toward anyone.

Transitioning from the Bull Baiter
to Loving Companion
Bulldogs weren’t always big softies. Originally, the Bulldog was
bred for the sport of bull-baiting in England. The fanciers of the
sport molded a Bulldog to perform specifically for bull-baiting.
The Bulldog who fought a bull in the ring needed to be a certain
build and to have fighting qualities. Breeders worked diligently to
mold the fighter that became the bull baiter. The fanciers wanted a
dog built low to the ground to make it harder for the bull to get his
horns underneath the dog. If the bull lifted the Bulldog on his
horns, the dog would be thrown across the stadium.
Plus the dog needed to be sturdy and well muscled to withstand
the occasional toss. Many early Bulldogs were smaller and lighter
than the Bullies of today. The nose needed to be set back from the
front of the muzzle and needed to turn up, so that when the dog
had a good grip on the bull’s nose, the dog’s nose wouldn’t be
buried in the bull’s face. The dog would be able to breathe without
ever letting go of the bull. The Bulldog’s distinctive wrinkles were a
sought-after feature because they channeled the bull’s blood away
from the dog’s eyes and nose.
The breeders also wanted a dog who was determined and wouldn’t
quit. In bull-baiting, people placed bets on how long the dog would
face the bull. Horrible stories circulated about handlers who
maimed their dogs to show that the dogs, even on two or three
legs, would keep going after the bull.
When bull-baiting was finally outlawed, the Bulldog’s future looked
grim. But fortunately, many people admired the Bulldog’s tempera-
ment, and breeders set out to preserve and perfect the Bulldog by
breeding out any viciousness but keeping the tenacious side of the
dog’s personality.
The result is today’s Bulldog — fierce looking on the outside and a
marshmallow on the inside. (See Figure 1-1.) But remember that
your Bully’s marshmallow interior can turn to granite if you ask
him to do something he doesn’t want to do. A Bulldog has retained
his spirit of determination and steadfastness. You can’t argue with
a Bulldog. Read more about the transition of the Bulldog and bull-
baiting in Chapter 2.

adult Bulldog.
Getting to Know the Bulldog
The Bulldog is a member of the American Kennel Club’s (AKC)
Non-Sporting Group (see Chapter 2).The non-sporting group
mostly includes dogs who may have had a specific job once upon a
time but who are now considered great companion dogs. When
you think about the Bully’s role, that’s not such a bad job descrip-
tion. Being a friend may be the most important job a dog can have.
So your Bully is a companion. Although plenty of Bulldogs compete
in performance events (see Chapter 11), just as many are content
to be low-maintenance buddies. Bullies are good with children and
enjoy a walk with the family or a game of tag or hide-and-seek.
They’re not enthusiastic about playing fetch, but they certainly
don’t mind watching you get the ball.
Be aware of the fact that your Bulldog can’t be your jogging com-
panion. He isn’t built for that, and his breathing (see Chapter 14)
doesn’t allow for wind sprints. The Bulldog is also highly suscepti-
ble to heat stroke, so beware of hot summer days. 
Chapter 1: Bulldog: A Tough Name for a Big Softy 11

You can’t force a Bulldog to do anything. He’s bred to be single-
minded and unyielding to rough handling. Also, fighting with your
Bully can aggravate breathing problems, if they exist, and can lead
to a serious emergency. Coax your Bully with kind words and tasty
treats.
Caring for and Feeding 
Your Bulldog
A Bulldog isn’t high maintenance, but she does need more care than
you may think. The Bully doesn’t have a lot of thick, fluffy undercoat
to worry about, but Bulldogs do need care (see Chapter 8). Pay
attention to particular parts of your Bully’s body:
 Hair: Those tiny, short hairs shed, but the coat isn’t the
biggest concern with Bulldogs.
 Wrinkles: Wrinkles are the biggest issue concerning the
Bulldog. Make sure your daily routine includes cleaning the
wrinkles and drying them thoroughly to prevent rash, infec-
tion, or other skin problems.
 Skin: Bulldogs are prone to skin ailments and allergies. Check
for hot spots and bald patches (see Chapter 14 for more infor-
mation on Bully ailments).
 Feet: Trim your Bully’s foot fur, and check between those toes
for any sign of interdigital cysts. Interdigital cysts are pus-filled
growths between the toes and are frequently caused by
ingrown hairs. Check out Chapter 14 for information on deal-
ing with these cysts.
Part I: A Bully for You 
12
Why non-sporting?
The Bulldog is too large for the toy group, and he definitely isn’t a terrier — he’d
never fit down the burrow of any small animal. The Bully isn’t a sight or scent hound
and doesn’t have the endurance for chasing game, even if he wanted to. The Bulldog
doesn’t herd sheep or cattle, so that eliminates the herding group. He’s not a sport-
ing dog. He doesn’t flush or point birds, and he can never retrieve a duck from a
pond. He doesn’t fill the bill as a dog to pull a cart or guard a flock or help fight crime
as a policeman’s pal. The non-sporting group categorizes all dogs that don’t fit in
any other class.

 Ears: Keep the ears clean and dry.
 Tail: Don’t forget your dog’s tail. The base of some Bulldog
tails fits into a sort of pocket of flesh, and that needs to be
kept as clean and dry as the wrinkles. A dab of petroleum jelly
in the pocket helps prevent irritation.
Bulldog care includes other functions, besides keeping the body
groomed, that you need to perform to ensure a healthy pet:
 Regularly visit your veterinarian. Keep your vaccinations up
to date, and consult your veterinarian if your dog is sick. Even if
the sickness turns out to be something minor, it’s always better
to be safe than sorry. (See Chapter 13 for more on your vet.)
 Make sure that your dog has identification. Attach her
license and rabies tags to a buckle collar. You may also want
to include a tag with your name and phone number. Consider
getting your Bully microchipped as another form of ID. (See
Chapter 5 for more information on identifying your Bully.)
 Watch what you feed your Bulldog. Control her weight, and
don’t let her get too heavy. An overweight dog has even more
trouble breathing and may develop hip problems and arthri-
tis. Extra weight puts extra stress on her heart and lungs, too.
Extra pounds can aggravate any existing problems and may
cause others (see Chapter 7).
No matter what you feed your Bulldog, keep her fit and trim
and healthy.
Keeping a Bulldog healthy can cost more than other dogs’ health
care. Surgery can be expensive because of certain procedures that
are protocol for the Bulldog. Bullies may have small tracheas and
elongated palates. When your dog has any kind of surgery, she may
be in danger during the recovery period. At that time, she isn’t
fully awake, and the soft palate can fall over the opening of the tra-
chea, cutting off the air supply. You pay extra for someone to sit
with your dog, making sure that she can breathe.
Figure out your budget. Make sure that you can afford a Bulldog.
The purchase price of the dog is just the beginning. Even if you
don’t include crates, beds, toys, baby gates, and fencing for the
yard, you still have to buy food and pay for regular trips to the vet-
erinarian, corrective surgeries, and emergencies.
Know that your Bulldog comes with a price tag. Don’t be scared off
by the costs; one dog costs a family roughly $6,000 over the life-
time of the dog.
Chapter 1: Bulldog: A Tough Name for a Big Softy 13

Showing Your Bulldog
No matter what you do together, remember that your Bully is a
member of your family for life. The love and companionship make
owning a Bully worth your time and money. Your Bulldog may be
your child’s best friend, your special cuddle buddy, or the family
trophy winner — or even all three!
If you decide that you want to experience the excitement of showing
your dog, you can choose among some of the following activities:
 Conformation: You may want to show your dog in conforma-
tion, which some people describe as a beauty contest for
dogs. The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an example
of a conformation show.
 Obedience: You can try obedience. In obedience, at the basic
level, your dog is judged on how well he walks by your side
(heels), sits, downs, and comes when called. At advanced
levels, your dog must also retrieve and jump high and broad
jumps.
No matter what you decide to try with your dog, teach him
some basic commands. Even if you never go beyond Sit,
Down, and Stay, these commands can help make daily living
more enjoyable. Chapter 10 tells you how to train and work
with your Bulldog to help him become a perfect gentleman.
 Rally: The relatively new sport of rally may attract you. Rally
judges the same behaviors as obedience, but in rally (see
Chapter 11) you perform the behavior posted on each sign on
the course, not the commands of a judge.
 Agility: If your Bully is athletic, agility may be just the activity
you’re looking for. An agility course consists of several jumps,
a teeter-totter, a tunnel, an elevated dog walk, and an A-frame,
and your dog must run the course in a specific amount of
time.
 Tracking: Last, you can compete in tracking — it’s just what it
sounds like. Your dog follows a track with a specified number of
turns and must find one or more specific articles on the track.
For more information on showing your Bully, see Chapters 2 and 11.

S
o you want to know a little more about Bulldogs? I’m glad
you asked, because the Bully is an incredibly interesting dog,
with an interesting history to match. In this chapter, I go over that
history.
You may not realize that several different Bulldog breeds are avail-
able, which is a bit confusing for some people looking for their first
Bulldog (see Figure 2-1). The Bulldog that is the subject of this
book was once called the English Bulldog, and some people still
refer to the Bulldog as the English Bulldog, even though the
American Kennel Club (AKC) dropped the “English” part of the
name over 80 years ago. The United Kennel Club (UKC) refers to
the breed as the English Bulldog. A breed called the Olde English
Bulldogge also exists. This breed is not the same as the Bulldog or
as the UKC’s English Bulldog. For purposes of recognition, when
the Bulldog is referenced (without other origins) in this chapter,
it is the English Bulldog. In this chapter, I acquaint you with the
breed standards for the dog so you’ll know one when you see one.
I also give you a little information about showing your Bully. And
finally, I give you a little more information on the French Bulldog
and the American Bulldog, which you can also see in Figure 2-1.

Figure 2-1: Three different Bulldog breeds: Bulldog (A), French Bulldog (B),
and American Bulldog (C).
Bull-Baiting to Bulldog Hugging
The origins of the Bulldog are vague. One source suggests that the
Bulldog developed from a cross of three different breeds: the Pug,
the Mastiff, and a breed of Spanish dog. Pugs were probably used,
along with other breeds, to set the current Bulldog type after bull-
baiting was banned. The screw-shaped tail of today’s Bulldog prob-
ably came from the Pug.
What is known is that the butchers in the old days used dogs to
manage the herds of cattle and to chase and worry specific ani-
mals before they were butchered. Besides being considered enter-
tainment, bull-baiting before an animal was butchered was thought
to make the meat more tender. A BBC radio report stated, “There
was a widespread mistaken belief that torturing the bull before
slaughtering it would make the meat tender. Butchers were some-
times required to have a bull baited before killing it. A refusal to do
so could lead to the butcher being fined.”
The sport of bull-baiting was brutal and cruel to both the bull and
the dogs. But by the time the practice of bull-baiting was outlawed,
it had produced a dog of such courage and determination that
some people didn’t want to see it disappear. For details on how
breeders created Bulldogs to be perfect bull baiters, see Chapter 1.

In fact, the British thought so highly of the dog’s personality that
the dog has become the symbol of Britain. In 1875, the Bulldog
Club was incorporated in England to promote and protect the
breed, and the Bulldog Club of America was founded in 1890 and
incorporated in 1904 for the same purpose.
Breeders worked to eliminate the ferocious side of the Bulldog’s
temperament while keeping his looks and his determination. 
Picturing the Bulldog
The English Bulldog, also just called the Bulldog, is a heavy, low-
built dog with lots of wrinkles on his face; a short, pushed-in nose;
a gentle temperament; and plenty of determination.
Figure 2-2 shows the basic anatomy of a Bulldog, giving an idea of
a Bulldog’s proportions. Figure 2-3 shows how the Bulldog should
appear from the front and back, and Figure 2-4 shows how the
Bulldog shows the distinctive pear shape, easily seen from above.
Beyond the general appearance of the Bulldog, formal standards
exist for the purpose of preserving the Bulldog breed. These stan-
dards, known as breed standards, serve as a blueprint for what fea-
tures and characteristics the ideal dog should have.

These standards are promoted through breed and kennel clubs for
the maintenance and welfare of the Bulldog breed. Three organiza-
tions oversee breed standards for the Bulldog: the American Kennel
Club (AKC), the Kennel Club (UK), and the United Kennel Club
(UKC). In the following sections, I go over the specific details of the
Bulldog standard used by each group.
If a Bulldog breed club exists in your area, this group can also be
an excellent source for information on Bulldogs, showers, and
breeders.

Perusing the pedigree
A dog’s pedigree is a family tree, telling you who his mother, father,
grandmother, grandfather, and the rest of his ancestors were. Get a
three-generation pedigree when you get your puppy.
The dogs listed on the top half of the pedigree are your puppy’s
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. The dogs listed on the
bottom half are the mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother.
The pedigree also tells you which dogs are champions, indicated
by the ch in front of their names. If a dog earned performance
titles, he will be listed with initials after his name. An example is
CD, which stands for Companion Dog. See Chapter 11 for the vari-
ous championship titles.
Some pedigrees tell you what color each dog is. The pedigree may
also note whether a dog is DNA tested. Many breeders submit
proof of their dog’s DNA to the AKC as a form of identification.
AKC Bulldog breed standard
Founded in 1884, the AKC is one of the nation’s leading not-for-
profit organizations devoted to the study, breeding, exhibiting,
and advancement of purebred dogs. The AKC operates the world’s
largest purebred-dog registry and is a strong advocate and sup-
porter of purebred dogs, responsible dog ownership, and canine
health. The AKC advances the integrity of breeding and sport of
purebred dogs.
The AKC’s mission also includes
 Maintaining a registry for purebred dogs and preserving its
integrity
 Sanctioning dog events that promote interest in breeding for
type and function of purebred dogs and sustaining this process
 Taking necessary actions to protect and continue the sport of
purebred dogs
In its operations, the AKC focuses on serving “The Fancy — the
dedicated breeders, exhibitors, judges, handlers, and other partici-
pants and enthusiasts who make the sport of purebred dogs so
rewarding and enjoyable.” Visit the AKC at www.akc.org.
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with the Bulldog Package 19

General appearance
The perfect Bulldog must be of medium size and smooth coat with
heavy, thick-set, low-swung body, massive short-faced head, wide
shoulders, and sturdy limbs.
The general appearance and attitude should suggest great stability,
vigor, and strength.
The disposition should be equable and kind, resolute and coura-
geous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacific
and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the
expression and behavior.
Size, proportion, symmetry
 Size: The size for mature dogs is about 50 pounds; for mature
bitches, about 40 pounds.
 Proportion: The circumference of the skull in front of the ears
should measure at least the height of the dog at the shoulders.
 Symmetry: The points should be well distributed and bear
good relation one to the other, no feature being in such promi-
nence from either excess or lack of quality that the animal
appears deformed or ill-proportioned.
 Influence of sex: In comparison of specimens of different sex,
due allowance should be made in favor of the bitches, which
do not bear the characteristics of the breed to the same
degree of perfection and grandeur as do the dogs.
Head
 Eyes and eyelids: The eyes, seen from the front, should be sit-
uated low down in the skull, as far from the ears as possible,
and their corners should be in a straight line at right angles
with the stop. They should be quite in front of the head, as
wide apart as possible, provided their outer corners are
within the outline of the cheeks when viewed from the front.
They should be quite round in form, of moderate size, neither
sunken nor bulging, and in color should be very dark. The lids
should cover the white of the eyeball, when the dog is looking
directly forward, and the lid should show no haw.
 Ears: The ears should be set high in the head, the front inner
edge of each ear joining the outline of the skull at the top back
corner of skull, so as to place them as wide apart, and as high,
and as far from the eyes as possible. In size they should be
small and thin. The shape termed “rose ear” is the most 
Part I: A Bully for You 
20

desirable. The rose ear folds inward at its back lower edge,
the upper front edge curving over, outward and backward,
showing part of the inside of the burr. (The ears should not be
carried erect or prick-eared or buttoned and should never be
cropped.)
 Skull: The skull should be very large, and in circumference, in
front of the ears, should measure at least the height of the dog
at the shoulders. Viewed from the front, it should appear very
high from the corner of the lower jaw to the apex of the skull
and also very broad and square. Viewed at the side, the head
should appear very high and very short from the point of the
nose to occiput. The forehead should be flat (not rounded or
domed), neither too prominent nor overhanging the face.
 Cheeks: The cheeks should be well rounded, protruding side-
ways and outward beyond the eyes.
 Stop: The temples or frontal bones should be very well defined,
broad, square and high, causing a hollow or groove between
the eyes. This indentation, or stop, should be both broad and
deep and extend up the middle of the forehead, dividing the
head vertically, being traceable to the top of the skull.
 Face and muzzle: The face, measured from the front of the
cheekbone to the tip of the nose, should be extremely short,
the muzzle being very short, broad, turned upward and very
deep from the corner of the eye to the corner of the mouth.
 Nose: The nose should be large, broad and black, its tip set
back deeply between the eyes. The distance from bottom of
stop, between the eyes, to the tip of nose should be as short
as possible and not exceed the length from the tip of nose to
the edge of underlip. The nostrils should be wide, large and
black, with a well-defined line between them. Any nose other
than black is objectionable and a brown or liver-colored nose
shall disqualify.
 Lips: The chops or “flews” should be thick, broad, pendant
and very deep, completely overhanging the lower jaw at each
side. They join the underlip in front and almost or quite cover
the teeth, which should be scarcely noticeable when the
mouth is closed.
 Bite/jaws: The jaws should be massive, very broad, square
and undershot, the lower jaw projecting considerably in front
of the upper jaw and turning up.
 Teeth: The teeth should be large and strong, with the canine
teeth or tusks wide apart, and the six small teeth in front,
between the canines, in an even, level row.
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with the Bulldog Package 21

Neck, topline, and body
 Neck: The neck should be short, very thick, deep and strong
and well arched at the back.
 Topline: There should be a slight fall in the back, close behind
the shoulders (its lowest part), whence the spine should rise
to the loins (the top of which should be higher than the top of
the shoulders), thence curving again more suddenly to the
tail, forming an arch (a very distinctive feature of the breed),
termed “roach back” or, more correctly, “wheel-back.”
 Body: The brisket and body should be very capacious, with
full sides, well-rounded ribs and very deep from the shoulders
down to its lowest part, where it joins the chest. It should be
well let down between the shoulders and forelegs, giving the
dog a broad, low, short-legged appearance.
 Chest: The chest should be very broad, deep and full.
 Underline: The body should be well ribbed up behind with
the belly tucked up and not rotund.
 Back and loin: The back should be short and strong, very
broad at the shoulders and comparatively narrow at the loins.
 Tail: The tail may be either straight or screwed (but never
curved or curly), and in any case must be short, hung low,
with decided downward carriage, thick root and fine tip. If
straight, the tail should be cylindrical and of uniform taper. If
screwed, the bends or kinks should be well defined, and they
may be abrupt and even knotty, but no portion of the member
should be elevated above the base or root.
Forequarters
 Shoulders: The shoulders should be muscular, very heavy,
widespread and slanting outward, giving stability and great
power.
 Forelegs: The forelegs should be short, very stout, straight
and muscular, set wide apart, with well-developed calves, pre-
senting a bowed outline, but the bones of the legs should not
be curved or bandy, nor the feet brought too close together.
 Elbows: The elbows should be low and stand well out and
loose from the body.
 Feet: The feet should be moderate in size, compact and firmly
set. Toes compact, well split up, with high knuckles and very
short stubby nails. The front feet may be straight or slightly
out-turned.
Part I: A Bully for You 
22

Hindquarters
 Legs: The hind legs should be strong and muscular and longer
than the forelegs, so as to elevate the loins above the shoul-
ders. Hocks should be slightly bent and well let down, so as to
give length and strength from the loins to hock. The lower leg
should be short, straight and strong, with the stifles turned
slightly outward and away from the body. The hocks are
thereby made to approach each other, and the hind feet to
turn outward.
 Feet: The feet should be moderate in size, compact and firmly
set. Toes compact, well split up, with high knuckles and short
stubby nails. The hind feet should be pointed well outward.
Coat and skin
 Coat: The coat should be straight, short, flat, close, of fine tex-
ture, smooth and glossy. (No fringe, feather, or curl.)
 Skin: The skin should be soft and loose, especially at the
head, neck and shoulders.
 Wrinkles and dewlap: The head and face should be covered
with heavy wrinkles, and at the throat, from jaw to chest, there
should be two loose pendulous folds, forming the dewlap.
Color of coat
 The color of coat should be uniform, pure of its kind and 
brilliant.
 The various colors found in the breed are to be preferred in
the following order:
1. Red brindle
2. All other brindles
3. Solid white
4. Solid red, fawn or fallow
5. Piebald
6. Inferior qualities of all the foregoing
 Note: A perfect piebald is preferable to a muddy brindle or
defective solid color. Solid black is very undesirable, but not
so objectionable if occurring to a moderate degree in piebald
patches. The brindles to be perfect should have a fine, even,
and equal distribution of the composite colors. In brindles
and solid colors a small white patch on the chest is not con-
sidered detrimental. In piebalds the color patches should be
well defined, of pure color, and symmetrically distributed.

Gait
 The style and carriage are peculiar, his gait being a loose-
jointed, shuffling, sidewise motion, giving the characteristic
roll.
 The action must, however, be unrestrained, free, and vigorous.
Temperament
 The disposition should be equable and kind, resolute and
courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should
be pacific and dignified.
 These attributes should be countenanced by the expression
and behavior.

Note
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
UKC Bulldog breed standard
With 250,000 registrations annually, the UKC is the second oldest
and second largest all-breed dog registry in the United States. The
UKC was founded in 1898 by Chauncey Z. Bennett, who wanted an
emphasis on the total dog, meaning a dog that looks and performs
equally well. Bennett encouraged breeders to breed for intelligence
and working ability as well as good conformation. The UKC was
conceived for the purpose of emphasizing each breed’s individual
working qualities and ensuring that those qualities continue to be
linked with the breed’s characteristic appearance.
The UKC recognized the English Bulldog in 1935. The Bulldog, as
preferred by the UKC, is a shorter, squattier version of its progeni-
tors. Regardless, the Bulldog has endeared itself to many because
of its loving, gentle temperament. For further information, visit
www.unitedkennelclub.com.
General appearance and characteristics
 The ideal English Bulldog is massive, of medium size and has
a smooth coat, a heavy, thick-set, low-slung body, wide shoul-
ders, sturdy limbs and a short-faced head.
 General appearance, coupled with attitude, suggests great 
stability, vigor and strength.
 The English Bulldog has an equable and kind disposition; and
is resolute and courageous. The characteristic demeanor is
one of peace and dignity. These attributes are evident in their
expression and behavior.
 When comparing both sexes, due consideration is to be given
to bitches, as they do not bear the breed characteristics to
the same degree as the males.
 All points of the standard are well distributed and bear good
relation one to the other. No feature is so prominent or so
lacking that it makes the animal appear deformed out of pro-
portion.
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with the Bulldog Package 29

Head
 The skull is very large. The circumference, taken in front of
the ears, measures at least the same as the height of the dog,
measured from the shoulders to the ground. When viewed
from the front, the head is very broad and square, and
appears very high from the corner of the lower jaw to the
apex of the skull.
 In profile, the head appears very high and very short from the
occiput to the point of the nose. The forehead is flat, never
rounded or domed; and never too prominent nor overhanging
the face.
 The well-defined temples (frontal bones) are broad, square
and high, causing the stop, a hollow, or groove, between the
eyes.
 The broad, deep stop extends up the middle of the forehead,
dividing the head vertically, being traceable to the top of the
skull.
 The well-rounded cheeks protrude sideways and outward
beyond the eyes.
 The extremely short face is measured from the front of the
cheekbone to the tip of the nose.
 The very short muzzle is turned upward and is very deep
from the corner of the eye to the corner of the mouth.
 The distance from the bottom of the stop (between the eyes)
to the tip of the nose is to be as short as possible, and does
not exceed the distance measured from the tip of the nose to
the edge of the under lip.
 The massive jaws are broad and very square. The undershot
lower jaw projects considerably in front of the upper jaw and
turns up.
 The thick, broad, pendant flews, referred to as the “chops,”
are very deep. They completely overhang the lower jaw at
each side. In front, they join the under lip, almost or quite cov-
ering the teeth, which are scarcely noticeable when the mouth
is closed.
Teeth
 A full complement of large, strong, white teeth meet in an
undershot bite.
 The canines are wide apart; and the incisors are in an even,
level row.
Part I: A Bully for You 
30

Eyes
 The very dark eyes are quite round and moderate in size;
never being sunken nor bulging. When the dog is looking
directly forward, the lids cover the white of the eyeball. There
is no haw showing.
 Viewed from the front, the eyes are situated low down in the
skull, as far back from the ears as possible. They are quite in
front of the head and as wide apart as possible, provided that
their outer corners are within the outline of the cheek, when
viewed from the front.
 The corners of the eyes are in a straight line at right angles
with the stop.
Nose
 The large, broad nose is black in color. Its tip is set back
deeply between the eyes.
 The wide, large nostrils are also black in color.
 Very serious fault — Nose color other than black.
 Disqualification — Brown or liver-colored nose.
Ears
 The small, thin rose ears are set high on the head.
 The front inner edge of each ear joins the outline of the skull
at the top back corner of the skull, placing them wide apart
and as far apart from the eyes as possible.
 Very serious faults — Erect ears; prick ears; button ears;
cropped ears.
Neck
 The short, very thick neck is deep, strong, and well-arched.
Forequarters
 The very heavy, muscular shoulders are widespread and slant
outward, providing stability and great power.
Forelegs
 The short, very stout forelegs are straight and muscular. They
are set wide apart, their well-developed calves presenting a
bowed outline.
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with the Bulldog Package 31

 The legs themselves are not curved or bandy, nor are the feet
brought too close together.
 The low elbows stand well out, and loose, from the body.
Body
 The brisket and body are very capacious, and very deep from
the shoulders down to the lowest part.
 The very broad chest is deep and full.
 The brisket is well let down between the shoulders and the
forelegs, causing a broad, low, short-legged appearance.
 The sides are full.
 The body is well-ribbed-up behind, and the ribs are well-
rounded.
 The belly is tucked up; not rotund.
 The backline is short and strong. It is very broad at the shoul-
ders and comparatively narrow at the loins. There is a slight
fall in the back, its lowest part being close behind the shoul-
ders. From there, the spine rises to the loins, then curves
again more suddenly to the tail, to form the breed characteris-
tic wheel back.
 The top of the loins is higher than the withers.
Hindquarters
 The strong, muscular hind legs are longer than the forelegs,
contributing to the elevation of the loins above the level of the
shoulders.
Hind legs
 The short lower legs are straight and strong.
 The stifles turn slightly outward and away from the body,
causing the hocks to approach each other and the hind feet
to turn outward.
 The slightly bent hocks are well let down, providing length
and strength from the loins to the hock.
Feet
 The compact, firmly set feet are moderate in size.
 The compact toes are well split up and have high knuckles
and short, stubby nails.
Part I: A Bully for You 
32

 The front feet may be straight or slightly turned out.
 The hind feet should be pointed well outward.
Tail
 The short tail is hung low, and has a thick root, a decided
downward carriage and a fine tip. It may be straight or
screwed, but never curved or curly.
 A straight tail is cylindrical and is tapered uniformly.
 A screw tail has well-defined bends or kinks that may be
abrupt or even knotty, but no portion of the tail may be ele-
vated above the base or root.
Skin
 The skin is soft and loose, especially at the head, neck and
shoulders.
Wrinkles and dewlap
 The head and face are covered with heavy wrinkles.
 There should be two loose, pendulous folds forming the
dewlap at the throat, from the jaw to the chest.
Coat
 The short, straight coat lies flat and close, and is smooth,
glossy and of a fine texture.
 There are no fringes, feathers, or curls.
Color
 Coat color is uniform, pure, and brilliant.
 The various breed typical colors are to be preferred in the fol-
lowing order:
• Red brindle
• All other brindles (Note: To be considered perfect,
brindles are to have a fine, even, and equal distribution
of the composite colors.)
• Solid white
• Solid red
• Fawn or yellow
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with the Bulldog Package 33

• Piebald
• Inferior specimens of all the foregoing (Note: A perfect
piebald is preferable to a muddy brindle or a defective
solid color. Solid black is very undesirable, but black is
not so objectionable if occurring, to a moderate degree,
in piebald patches.)
 Note: A small white patch on the chest is acceptable in
brindles and solid-colored dogs. Color patches on piebalds
are expected to be well-defined, of pure color, and symmetri-
cally distributed.
Weight
 Weight for mature dogs is approximately 50 pounds.
 Weight for mature bitches is approximately 40 pounds.
Gait
 Movement style and carriage are distinctive to the breed. It is
a loose-jointed, shuffling, sideways motion, causing the char-
acteristic roll.
 However, action is free, vigorous, and unrestricted.
Disqualifications
 Unilateral or bilateral cryptorchid
 Viciousness or extreme shyness
 Brown or liver-colored nose
 Albinism
The French and American Bulldogs
Though similar to the more common English Bulldog, the French
and American versions do display some important points of differ-
ence. Refer back to Figure 2-1 to see how the various Bulldog
breeds differ in appearance.
The French Bulldog
The French Bulldog looks like a miniature Bulldog with bat ears.
The English produced some toy Bulldogs in the mid-1800s, but
they didn’t become popular, and many were sent to France. In
Part I: A Bully for You 
34

France, they were crossed with other breeds and called French
Bulldogs. The breed was a popular pet of Parisian prostitutes and
then became popular with fashionable ladies who considered it
daring to have a prostitute’s dog.
At first, the French Bulldog had two ear types: the rose ear and the
bat ear. American breeders championed the bat ear, and the French
Bulldog Club of America was founded in 1898 to further the breed.
The French Bulldog and the Bulldog are two separate and distinct
breeds, but the standard for the French Bulldog is similar to that of
the English Bulldog. According to the standard, the Bulldog’s chest
should be “very broad, deep, and full.” In the French Bulldog stan-
dard, the chest “is broad, deep, and full.” Tail, topline, and permis-
sible colors are also similar.
The American Bulldog
The American Bulldog is recognized by the UKC but not by the
AKC. The American Bulldog — used as a cattle and hog dog —
is a more athletic version of the Bulldog. The American version is
a great companion as well. As far as body type, the American
Bulldog still has a large head but a well-defined stop and more
muzzle than a Bulldog. Ears may be drop, semi-prick, rose, or
cropped.
American Bulldogs range in height from 20 to 27 inches, depending
on whether the dog is male or female. A male weighs 75 to 125
pounds, a female 60 to 100 pounds. A Bulldog male weighs about
50 pounds, a female 40 pounds. The American Bulldog has a
topline that slopes slightly from the withers to the tail; a Bulldog
has the distinctive roach or wheel back.
The American Bulldog is protective and may be used as a guard
dog, whereas the Bulldog prefers a snooze on the couch.

 Discovering the ins and outs of Bullies
 Owning a Bulldog: What does it really cost?
B
ulldog puppies are adorable, and adult Bullies have an engag-
ing seriousness in their wrinkled faces, but looks alone aren’t
reason enough to run right out and purchase a Bulldog. Before you
commit to ten years of Bulldog care, take a minute to consider
whether a Bulldog is what you really want. This chapter provides
key facts to keep in mind before taking the step of getting a Bully of
your own.
The Bulldog Point of View
Bulldogs possess behavioral quirks specific to their breed that
require you to take some time to think about how good the match
would be before you get one. If any of the traits mentioned in this
chapter doesn’t fit in with your lifestyle or with what you expect
from your dog, consider getting a different breed. However, a
Bulldog may be perfect for you if the following list represents
your behaviors and the kind of dog you want:
 Couch Potato is your middle name.
 Grooming isn’t on your list of fun things to do.
 You leave for much of the day.
 You want a companion to hang out with after a hard day’s work.
Bulldogs love to be with their families, but they also like to snooze
the day away. You can go off to work and know that your Bully isn’t
desperate for an afternoon game of fetch. And when you return
home, your pal will be waiting for a snuggle on the couch.

When you come home and plop down on the couch, you may notice
that your Bully has left behind a present for you. You have dog hair
all over your black pants! A Bulldog’s short and smooth coat sheds
much more hair than you may imagine, and your Bulldog sheds year
round, but you won’t have the hours of combing, brushing, and trim-
ming maintenance that you would with many longer-coated breeds.
Do pay attention to his wrinkles, though; you can easily manage a
little touch up during your evening TV time on the couch. See
Chapter 8 for tips on grooming your Bulldog.
Recognizing that Bullies 
aren’t athletes
You must realize that your Bulldog is your companion; she isn’t an
athlete. In fact, Bulldogs are predisposed for lounging around.
If you want a dog to keep you company in your active lifestyle, con-
sider a different breed. The Bulldog isn’t built for speed, and even
if she wanted to run, jump, and play for extended periods of time,
she just can’t. Her short, pushed-in nose doesn’t allow airflow like
active dogs, and an elongated soft palate and small trachea further
hamper a Bully’s breathing. High heat and humidity also make
Bulldogs unhappy, and hot conditions can affect their health.
Overheating poses a real danger for a Bulldog.
If you expect to spend a day paddling around the lake with your
Bully, you may need to reconsider. Drowning is a major cause of
death in Bulldogs. As one breeder says, “They swim like a rock.”
A Bulldog’s temperament slows her down, too. Bulldogs want to
please themselves. They aren’t driven to work, and they don’t act
on command to please their owners.
Integrating Bullies with 
children and animals
If you have children, trust that your sturdy Bulldog can take a bit
of rough play and is gentle enough in nature not to snap at your
kids. With that said, supervise your child and dog at all times. You
don’t want either to get too rough. Teach your children to be
gentle with any dog. Be aware that the Bulldog is powerful, and
small children may get knocked over during playtime.
Never leave any dog unattended with a baby. Babies make fast,
jerky movements and high-pitched noises. Instinctively, dogs like
to catch and kill critters that make these movements and sounds.
Part I: A Bully for You 
38

If your Bulldog joins other pets in the family, he tends to fit in just
fine. Bulldogs generally get along with other dogs, but to be on the
safe side, choose a dog of the opposite sex to the one in residence.
Same-sex dogs may get along at first, but after the puppy reaches
sexual maturity, jealousy and territorialism can present trouble.
Same-sex dog fights can be very serious, and once the dogs have
decided they don’t like each other, they’ll always need to be sepa-
rated. Spaying and neutering your Bulldog often eliminates some of
this behavior (see Chapter 14).
Bulldogs adjust appropriately to cats if raised with them. Perform
introductions gradually, and don’t leave the pets alone together
until you’re sure that everyone gets along.
Rabbits, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, and other small pets top
the list of prey for a Bulldog. Use caution, because it’s the Bulldog
instinct to catch and kill these critters. Keep smaller pets out of
harm’s way when you can’t supervise interactions.
Examining the Cost of Ownership
Bulldogs require investments of both time and money, so make
sure you’re vested in the process. The following list provides time
and money issues to consider before getting your Bulldog. I don’t
give exact cost figures — cost can vary depending on where you
live — but you’ll get the general idea:
 A Bulldog puppy costs between $2,000 and $3,000.
 All dogs need regular veterinary checkups, and over the
course of your dog’s life, he’ll need vaccinations, medicines,
and possibly surgeries (see Part IV).
 Bulldogs love to chew and seem to have a preference for dry-
wall. Their sturdy jaws can do serious damage to kitchen cabi-
nets and furniture. If your adult Bully suffers from separation
anxiety, the loneliness may manifest itself in destructive chew-
ing. Consider crate training to alleviate some of these prob-
lems. (Head to Chapter 9 for crate training suggestions.)
 Surgical procedures may cost more for a Bulldog than for
most other breeds. Bullies need constant supervision in
recovery. Their elongated soft palates and enlarged tonsils
may block airways and cause suffocation during recovery.
During this period, some veterinarians charge extra for the
time needed to sit with the Bulldog. Ask your veterinarian
ahead of time whether there’ll be an extra charge.
Chapter 3: Deciding on a Bulldog 39

Careful breeding is reducing the incidence of some of the
Bulldog’s conditions. Most Bulldogs are sensitive to the pre-
anesthetic acepromazine, and most vets familiar with the breed
avoid this anesthetic. The largest issue is that Bulldogs take far
less of most anesthesia than other dogs their weight. Finding a
Bulldog-savvy vet can save both lives and pocketbooks.
 Your Bulldog requires time but not excessive amounts. Make
sure you have the time to housetrain and walk and play with
your Bulldog before you bring him home. Schedule time for
cleaning face wrinkles and clipping nails, too.
 Don’t forget the things that all dogs need: daily meals, dishes,
toys, bedding, and other items that you think are essential for
your Bulldog’s well-being! (Check out Part II.)
Also understand the problems your Bulldog faces as a result of his
build. Consider where he’ll live. Be prepared to make adjustments
and sacrifices to keep him happy and healthy. Do your homework,
and run your budget, and then go find the Bulldog of your dreams.

Upon entering a small country store, a stranger noticed a sign stating, “DANGER!
BEWARE OF DOG!” posted on the glass door. Inside, a Bulldog slept on the floor
beside the cash register. The man asked the store manager, “Is that the dog folks
are supposed to beware of?”
“Yep, that’s him,” came the reply.
The amused stranger inquired, “That certainly doesn’t look like a dangerous dog to
me. Why in the world would you post that sign?”
The owner responded, “Because before I posted that sign, people kept tripping
over him.”

someone who is just a phone call away when you have a
question or a problem? If you’re looking for a support system,
someone who helps you do your best for your Bully for his entire

In this chapter, I give you advice on finding a good Bulldog breeder.
I also have some advice for you if you decide to go to a pet shop,
and I let you in on some information about adopting older dogs, as
well as hints for picking a healthy puppy. I also tell you a bit about
registering your dog and making sure you get a pedigree.
Picking Your Pup
No matter where you get your Bulldog, finding a healthy one is
important. Your dog is going to be part of your family for around
eight to ten years. If you start with a sick puppy, he may never be
healthy, and you’ll incur veterinary bills right away and possibly
for the dog’s entire life. Ask about the parents of your dog and
what their health is like. Meeting the parents or the mother gives
you an idea of what your puppy may be like. Any adult you meet
should be friendly, not shy or fearful.
A puppy needs to stay with his mother and siblings until he is at
least 7 weeks old. If the breeder or pet store is selling younger 

puppies, find another place to get your dog. Some breeders feel
that eight weeks is ideal; others like to keep the puppies for 12
weeks, making sure that the puppies have all their shots and start-
ing them on crate training and housetraining.
Ask to see the puppy area. The surroundings should be clean, well
lit, and near household activity. The puppies must be healthy. If
the breeder brings out individual puppies and refuses to show you
where the litter lives, find another breeder.
Here are some things to look for in a puppy:
 You want a healthy puppy. If the puppy is lethargic or has a
running nose or gunk in his eyes, don’t let your sympathy
make your decision.
If the puppy is dirty and has open sores, leave him behind.
 Choose an active puppy (see Figure 4-1) and one who has
clear eyes and a healthy nose.
 Ask for the health records for the puppy. An updated shot
record and worming history should be provided, as well as
the pedigree. Ask whether the parents were tested for any
health problems.
 Ask the age of the puppy. If he was taken from his mother and
littermates too early, he may develop socialization problems
later on.

healthy, and playful pup.

Finding a Bulldog Breeder
Serious, responsible breeders help you select just the right puppy
for your family and always provide assistance for you and your
dog. You can find a breeder in several different ways:
 Visit the Bulldog Club of America’s Web site at www.thebca.
org. You can locate breeders in your state or in nearby states.
Be prepared to expand your search if you can’t find a breeder
close to you. Most breeders are also happy to recommend
someone else if they’re not expecting a litter soon or don’t
have puppies.
 If you’re friend owns a Bulldog, ask him where he found his
dog. Ask whether he’s happy with his dog and the breeder.
Your friend can make the introductions and recommend you
to the breeder.
 Attend a dog show near you. Buy a catalog listing the owners
of all the dogs entered at that show. Watch the Bulldog judg-
ing. Talk to some of the handlers about Bulldogs.
Talk to handlers after the dog show. Before the judging, limit
your conversation. The handler may be too preoccupied to
have a long conversation. She may be watching the judging
pattern or trying to get her dog to be alert and happy before
entering the ring. After the show, ask the handler whether you
can speak with her. Most people are happy to answer ques-
tions about their favorite breed.
How do you know that breeders at shows or on Web sites are
responsible? Well, you don’t, but odds are that if they’ve joined the
national club and shown their dogs, they take the time to do the
job right. Unlike many breeds, where producing a litter is relatively
easy, Bulldogs are all bred by using artificial insemination, and the
puppies are delivered by C-section. A lot of thought and money go
into every litter.
No matter where you find your breeder, be prepared to wait for
your puppy. Producing a litter of Bulldog puppies is an expensive,
time-consuming process, and the litters aren’t very large. Breeders
you talk to may already have a waiting list.
Even if you think that you’ve found a breeder, take the time to talk
with him. If the breeder seems more interested in making a sale
than in helping you understand and care for a Bulldog, maybe he
isn’t the right breeder after all. Take the time to find a breeder you
like and trust. Believe me, your best friend for the life of your
Bulldog is your breeder.
Chapter 4: Finding the Best Bulldog for You 43

Facing the firing squad
After you’ve found your breeder, the questioning process begins.
Whether the breeder has puppies at the moment, she’ll still ask
you questions — a lot of questions. You may want to reference
Chapter 5 to prepare to answer some of the following questions.
A friend of mine is a breeder. Here are the questions she asks of
potential Bulldog owners:
 How did you hear about me?
She wants to know whether someone she knows referred you
to her. If she knows the person, she can ask opinions of you as
a potential owner.
 If you own or have owned a Bulldog, where did you get
your dog?
If you’ve owned a Bulldog previously, you know what you’re
getting into. If you rescued your dog, you may need more
information from her about how to raise and train a puppy.
 What books, if any, have you read about the breed?
She doesn’t want one of her puppies to go to someone who
just wants a Bulldog on a whim, and she wants you to know
what to expect if you own a Bulldog.
 What are your expectations for your dog? Describe what
you want in a dog.
She wants to make sure that a Bulldog suits your lifestyle. She
knows that a Bulldog can’t keep up with a jogger, and you may
be disappointed if you want a dog that’s eager to play all day.
 Do you prefer a male or a female puppy? Are you willing to
take a puppy of the opposite sex? If not, what creates the
preference?
If you’re not firm about your preference, the breeder may
match you with the best puppy for your family, no matter
what the sex.
 Are you interested in an older puppy or an adult?
Sometimes breeders keep puppies to see whether they dis-
play show potential. The puppies that don’t make the grade
are still good pets, and one of them may be perfect for you (if
you aren’t interested in showing your Bulldog).
 Tell me about your household. Do you have a spouse, part-
ner, or roommates? Children? Their ages?
Part I: A Bully for You 
44

The breeder wants to make sure that everyone in the family
welcomes the puppy. The breeder needs to feel that children
are old enough to understand how to play properly with a
puppy.
 Do any family members suffer from allergies?
The heartbreak from falling in love with a puppy and then
having to give her up is overwhelming. The breeder wants to
prevent this heartache if she can.
 Who is responsible for the care and training of your pet?
No breeder wants a puppy to be neglected. No matter how
responsible your children are, an adult is ultimately responsi-
ble for the care of the puppy.
 Would you characterize your family as the “outdoors type”
or “homebodies”?
Again, the breeder wants to make sure that the Bulldog is, in
fact, the right breed for you.
 Have you had a dog before? Do you have other pets (dogs,
cats, birds, fish)? Please tell me about your pet-owning 
experience.
She wants to hear that you’re committed to spending the time
and energy to care for a Bulldog.
 Have you researched a veterinarian, or have you used a vet
in the past? If so, please provide the name, address, and
phone number.
The breeder is concerned about her puppies and wants to
make sure that you have a veterinarian lined up.
 Do you live in a house, townhouse, condo, or apartment?
How large is your yard, and what type of fencing do you
have? Please describe, including height.
Bulldogs can live happily in any style of home, but the breeder
wants to know how you handle housetraining. If you have a
yard where your Bully can run loose, make sure that the yard
is secure and keeps your Bulldog safe.
 Do you have a pool?
Many breeders don’t sell a Bulldog to a family with a pool.
Bulldogs may love the water, but they’re not good swimmers.
Some Bullies can’t swim at all.
 If you rent, does your landlord allow you to have a dog?
Please provide landlord contact information.
Chapter 4: Finding the Best Bulldog for You 45

Typically, a breeder doesn’t let a dog go to a home where he’s
not allowed. She doesn’t want one of her puppies returned or,
worse, taken to a shelter.
 In what rooms inside your home will your dog be permit-
ted? How do you plan to keep your dog out of certain parts
of your home if necessary?
Making some rooms off limits is okay.
 Have you thought about housetraining a puppy and han-
dling an adult dog? Where will your dog go to eliminate?
How will you clean up?
More questions designed to make you think. A puppy isn’t an
impulse purchase. Think about what getting a puppy means in
terms of time and effort.
 How many hours each day will your dog be left alone? Do
you have a secure place to leave your pet while you’re away
from home? Where will your pet sleep at night?
Your breeder doesn’t want your dog left out unattended all
day or put in the basement or garage. Depending on the
weather, certain ailments like heat stroke or frostbite can
befall your dog. Leaving your dog out in the yard also pro-
vides an easy target for dognappers.
 Can you devote the time needed during the critical first few
months to teach manners and expose your puppy to many
new experiences?
Training and proper socialization are important elements in
a puppy’s development into a secure and happy adult 
companion.
 Do you know where you can go for obedience training or
socialization?
Don’t worry if you say no. Your breeder has suggestions if you
want to take a class.
Don’t be put off by the questions. The breeder wants to ensure
that you know what you’re getting into by choosing a Bulldog. The
kind of home environment and the thought process put into pur-
chasing a Bulldog are other factors that breeders want to know.
She needs to be reassured that your home makes a great place for
one of her beloved puppies.
Questioning the questioner
Prepare a list of questions for your Bulldog breeder, too. Below are
some sample questions to ask. Any reputable breeder will be able
Part I: A Bully for You 
46

to answer these questions. If you aren’t satisfied with the answers
or some questions can’t be answered, tuck your tail and run:
 How long have you been breeding? Is breeding a business
or a hobby? How often do your dogs produce a litter?
No breeder makes a living breeding Bulldogs if breeding is
done correctly. If she says that breeding is her business, look
for another breeder. If a breeder produces a few litters, she’ll
be able to tell you what to expect as your puppy grows.
 Is a Bulldog right for me?
The breeder wants all her puppies to go to permanent homes.
Asking this question gives her a chance to ask a few questions
of her own and to talk about the negative aspects of owning a
Bulldog.
 May I see the pedigree and registration form?
You especially want to see the pedigree if you’re thinking of
showing. Pedigrees also ensure that you’re getting a purebred
Bulldog. A registration slip accompanies each puppy, so you
can register your dog.
 May I receive a health record?
Your breeder provides a health record (or at least she should)
with each puppy. The record shows what vaccinations your
pup has received and the dates the puppies were wormed.
 What happens if I can’t keep the dog?
Most reputable breeders can take back one of their dogs at
any time, but the terms may vary from breeder to breeder.
Read your contract. If you return a puppy within the time
period allowed for a veterinary check, you may get a refund of
the purchase price. If a problem such as temperament devel-
ops later, breeders frequently offer to replace the puppy with
another one. If you’ve had your Bulldog for a few years and
now circumstances prevent you from keeping her, your
breeder may be able to take her, and you can have some
peace of mind, knowing that your dog lives in a good home.
But if this last scenario is your case, you don’t get a refund.
You may think that not getting your money back is unfair at
first, but the breeder now has another dog to care for (and the
costs incurred by that dog), and depending on the dog’s age,
your dog may not find a new home.
Chapter 4: Finding the Best Bulldog for You 47

Deciphering breeder contracts
After you’ve settled on a breeder, read the contract that the
breeder has drawn up. Contracts can protect both you and the
breeder, but make sure that you read the contract carefully before
you sign. The contract may be as simple as a statement listing the
dog, his pet or show quality, and instructions agreed on for care
(such as agreeing to spay or neuter the puppy). Detailed contracts
outline further evaluations of the dog to determine whether the
Bully can be shown, the breeder can use a male as a stud, or the
price was adjusted because the breeder wants a puppy back if you
ever breed.
If you could turn back time
The contract may also state that if for any reason you can’t keep
the dog, the Bully returns to the breeder. Breeders do have this
clause to prevent dogs they’ve bred from ending up in shelters or
rescues. Don’t be afraid to admit that you made a mistake or that
you can’t afford the dog. Breeders rather take the dog back than
see him suffer in a shelter.
Registration stipulation
The contract may also state whether the puppy is under a limited
registration. Breeders use limited registration to make sure that a
pet isn’t bred. Offspring from a limited-registration dog may not be
registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC).
Part I: A Bully for You 
48
Surfing for Bulldogs
You may be tempted to look online for your Bulldog puppy. An online search may
give you the names of breeders whether you look at the American Kennel Club (AKC)
Web site or the Bulldog Club of America (BCA) site. You may even find individual
breeders who aren’t on either list. Some sites even sell puppies. You may get a good
puppy online, but how do you know before it’s too late? You’re unable to see the
parents; and even the puppy is a mystery until he arrives on your doorstep. Pictures
can’t tell you about the puppy’s personality or whether he’s healthy. Don’t you want
to know how your Bully was raised?
I trust certain breeders to send me a puppy sight unseen, but generally, I’d want to
see the puppy and the mother before I’d buy a dog. Consider the money you may
spend to purchase your dog. You want to go to a reputable breeder and visit your
puppy before he comes home. You’ve invested in your Bully; now protect your
investment.

Health guarantees
The contract may include health information, or the health guaran-
tee may be a separate document. The health guarantee gives you a
specific amount of time — usually 48 hours — to take your puppy
to a veterinarian for a health check. If a problem occurs within that
time frame, the breeder may refund your purchase price. Breeders
may also offer a replacement puppy if a major problem develops
within the first year. Make sure that you understand the offerings
in the contract before you take your puppy home.
Puppy co-ownership
Some breeders don’t sell a puppy outright but insist on co-
ownership. The breeder and you share custody of your Bulldog
until one or more of the following events occur:
 Your Bully earns a championship title. Think about the time,
the money, and the drive it takes to go to dog shows until
your dog finishes. If you can’t personally get the dog finished
with his show circuit, is the breeder willing to show him? Who
pays the expenses? Are you willing to be separated from your
dog for six months to a year while he’s being shown? Leaving
your Bulldog with the breeder until your dog earns a title may
be tough — it can mean months without seeing your dog!
 Your Bully breeds, and the breeder gets a puppy. If the
breeder sells you a puppy at a reduced price and retains co-
ownership until she gets a puppy back, make sure that you
understand what is involved in breeding a Bulldog. That “bar-
gain” puppy you got may cost you more in the long run than a
puppy you pay full price for. See Chapter 18 for information
and costs associated with breeding.
Co-ownerships can and do work, but know what you’re getting into
before you sign the papers. You may want that cute Bully puppy so
much that you’ll agree to anything right now, but you may be sorry
a year from now.
Perusing Pet Shops
A cute Bulldog puppy and the instant gratification are hard to
resist when you’re able to scoop that puppy up and take him
home, with no questions from a breeder and no waiting for a litter.
Still, many of the same criteria apply no matter where your dog
comes from.
Chapter 4: Finding the Best Bulldog for You 49

You aren’t able to meet either of the puppy’s parents, which means
that you don’t have an idea of temperament or size. Generally, pet-
shop Bulldogs are leggier and thinner than the Bulldogs that come
from a breeder.
A puppy from a pet shop may cost more than a puppy from a
breeder, and you lack the benefit of the breeder’s experience. No
one is available to call when you need advice. Whether your Bully
has a major health problem or you can’t keep your dog for any
reason, the pet shop won’t take him back.
Adopting an Older Bulldog
If you want an older dog, consider a dog from an animal shelter or
from a Bulldog rescue group. The advantages to an adult dog seem
endless:
 Your adult Bully may already be housetrained, and even if he
isn’t housetrained, he can train faster than a puppy and wait
longer between trips outside.
 An older dog doesn’t need the concentrated effort a puppy
needs. Your dog still craves love and attention, but if you
don’t have the time or energy to deal with a puppy’s training
and socialization, an older Bulldog may be perfect for you.
 Older Bullies already “speak English.” They understand the
words you use, even if they don’t always obey!
 Your dog is beyond the chewing stage. He is grateful for a soft
bed and less likely to want to destroy it. He may not be as
eager as a puppy to turn your good shoes into chew toys.
 Don’t worry that an older dog won’t bond with you. It’s amaz-
ing how quickly that bond can form.
The disadvantage of getting an older dog is inheriting all his bad
habits. You may not know what his life was like before you got him.
The Bulldog Club of America (BCA) makes this statement about
rescue on its Web site: “A majority of our rescues have social, emo-
tional, behavioral, and health issues. If you aren’t able or willing to
deal with a not-so-perfect Bully, your wait may be a long one. Many
rescued Bulldogs are dog aggressive and have trust issues. Some
aren’t suitable for placing with children. Rarely does a happy, well-
adjusted Bulldog end up in our care. If you aren’t committed to
dealing with housebreaking issues in an adult dog or to provide
obedience training, you may not really want to take on a rescued
Bulldog.”
Part I: A Bully for You 
50

You can still get a potentially wonderful dog from rescue, but you
have to be willing to work to get that wonderful dog. The same
determination to save a Bully by adopting from a shelter or apply-
ing to a rescue organization ought to be applied to turning your
Bully into a cherished family member.
Take some extra time in training your dog new habits. An old dog
can learn new tricks!
Considering shelter dogs
The Bulldog is a popular breed, so you may find one at your local
shelter. Getting a dog from a shelter costs less than getting a puppy.
Spay or neutering fees, along with up-to-date shots, are included in
the adoption fee. Many shelters now foster their strays, sending
them home with volunteers to monitor behavior around other dogs,
cats, and children.
Some shelters keep a list of names of people who want a specific
breed. See whether your shelter provides this service. Otherwise,
call at least once a month. If possible, visit the shelter in person.
Shelters rely on volunteer help, and frequent turnover may mean
that the volunteer who said that she’d call you no longer works
there.
Contacting Bully rescue groups
Dogs end up in rescue for a variety of reasons: owner death, family
unwilling to care for pet, or serious health or behavior problems.
Rescue workers work diligently to place Bulldogs in appropriate
homes. Rescue personnel do everything possible to make a good
match. They want the rescued dogs to go into permanent homes.
Workers can usually tell you how the dog reacts to other animals
and to children. Typically, dogs from rescue organizations are
spayed or neutered and have all their shots. Many breed rescue
groups have dogs available in each state. Vets, local animal shel-
ters, and pet-supply stores often have information on how to con-
tact these groups, and many can also be found on the Internet.
Registering Your Puppy
When your breeder registered the litter with the AKC (see Chap-
ter 2), she received an individual registration form from the AKC
for each puppy. You receive that form when you purchase your
dog. Fill out the form, including your puppy’s name, and send the
form to the AKC with the registration fee.
Chapter 4: Finding the Best Bulldog for You 51

You can also register online. Previously, the litter owner had to enter
the dog’s information before the new owner could register the dog
online. Now the AKC registration forms include a PIN number that
allows the new owner to register the dog quickly online.
Two types of registration are available: full and limited. A full regis-
tration indicates that the dog’s offspring may be registered with the
AKC. A limited registration renders any offspring ineligible for regis-
tration. Limited registration may be changed to full registration at
any time, but only the breeder may make the change.
The purpose of limited registration prevents a fault from being
passed on if the breeder doesn’t feel that the dog meets the breed
standard. A contract may call for the buyer to spay or neuter, but
the limited registration ensures that owners aren’t able to register
the offspring of their dog.
Limited registration also means that the dog isn’t eligible for AKC
conformation events but is eligible for all other AKC sports, such
as obedience and agility.
The AKC serves as the primary registry for Bulldogs in the United
States. Pups sold with a Fédération Cynologique Internationale
(FCI) registration are imports who may be eligible for AKC registra-
tion, but at a cost of around $100 extra. Many importers are profit
driven, and the health and family history of the pup are often hard
to verify. Also, many imported puppies are taken from their moth-
ers too early, which may set the puppies up for behavioral prob-
lems. Unless you’ve visited the breeder and had a chance to
inspect the breeding facilities and go through your checklist of
breeder questions, buyer, beware.
You don’t have to register your Bulldog, but I recommend it. If
you decide to compete in any of the performance events, your dog
needs to be registered. If you own an unregistered purebred Bully,
submit a form and pictures of your dog to the AKC. If the AKC agrees
that your dog is a purebred, the club assigns an Indefinite Listing
Privilege (ILP) number that allows you and your Bully to compete
in all performance events. You may not compete in conformation.
Registering your puppy in the beginning is faster and easier, though.
Registries ensure that both a dog’s parents are the same breed.
Saying that a Bulldog is AKC registered isn’t a guarantee of quality.
You need to rely on the breeder for that.

T
his chapter helps you prepare your home for the new arrival.
Use the information contained here as a checklist to ensure
that you have everything needed for your Bulldog before he sets
foot in his new home. Having everything prepared in advance
makes the transition less stressful for both you and your dog, so
you can both enjoy your Bully’s homecoming.
Making the Outdoors Safe 
for Your Bulldog
Before you bring your Bully home, take a look at your yard. If it’s
already fenced, you’re a step ahead. Make sure that the fence you
have can keep your Bully safe. You want to make sure that your
puppy can’t escape or get his head stuck in the fence. Fences with
gaps large enough for a puppy to wiggle through need extra re-
inforcement near the ground to cover the gaps.
Choosing traditional fencing
If you don’t have a fence, think about your long-term needs. A
chain-link fence is easier to care for than solid wood but doesn’t
give you or your property privacy. Sadly enough, you need to think
about your community. People, including small children, and other
dogs may tease or annoy your dog. A solid fence may also prevent

your dog from being stolen because dognappers can’t see what’s
behind the fence. Solid PVC fences are maintenance free and give
you privacy. However, PVC fences are probably the most expensive
of all the fence types.
Whatever kind of fencing you choose, make sure that it’s high
enough. Bulldogs aren’t noted for a lot of fence jumping, but your
fence needs to keep other dogs out as well as keep your Bully in. A
fence height of 5 feet is the minimum I would consider, but assess
your neighborhood. Just remember that your neighborhood can
change. Having a higher fence installed initially is cheaper than
paying for a total replacement later.
Opting for invisible fencing
Invisible fencing is an increasingly popular type of protection for
your dog. Installation requires a buried wire around your property.
The confining concept is simple: Your dog wears a collar, and when
he nears the buried boundary, an audible tone warns him. If he
continues to the border, he receives a mild shock from the collar.
Because Bulldogs generally aren’t crazy about mild shocks and
noises they don’t like, this routine of bells and shocks trains your
dog to stay in his yard. 
Have a reputable company install your invisible fencing. These
companies don’t just install the wire and give you a collar; they
also work with you to train your dog properly, so he respects the
boundaries.
Invisible fencing has its drawbacks. Although your dog is kept in
his yard, other loose dogs can enter your property, as can people.
Bulldogs maintain a sweet and even temperament, but that doesn’t
mean that they won’t defend their territory from a stray dog or cat.
You don’t want strangers teasing or, worse, stealing your dog. You
also run the risk of accidental pregnancy if your female Bully isn’t
spayed. Any male dog in the neighbor can access your female
Bully. My vote is for a real fence.
Safeguarding Your Home
Puppies are like small children. They want to explore every inch of
their world, and in the process, they want to taste everything. Like
a small child, your Bully puppy puts everything in her mouth.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
56

Protect your belongings and your dog with a little thought before
the puppy arrives. Look around the rooms at puppy level. Remove
or block off anything that poses a danger or can be destroyed.
Safety is your responsibility — put dangers out of your puppy’s
way. Don’t let him sample anything that may cause harm or death.
Here are some important safeguarding standards to consider:
 Crate your puppy when you can’t watch her or when you’re
going out. If you do nothing else to puppyproof your house,
do this.
 Protect your dog from the electrical cords in the house.
Make cords as unreachable as possible. Tape down long cords
that are reachable. A chewed lamp cord is a deadly hazard for
your puppy.
 Use childproof locks on cupboards in your kitchen or bath-
room that have loose doors. Especially consider locks for
doors under sinks where cleaning supplies are stored.
No matter how well you puppy proof your house, your curious
puppy will find and destroy something. You can have a perfect
house, or you can have a puppy. There are some common-sense
things you can do to protect your household items from your pup.
Some examples are:
 If you own fragile collectibles, put them on high shelves on
sturdy bookcases. Puppies can bump into tables and book-
cases when they play. If the coffee table is covered with tempt-
ing items for your puppy, remove the temptations from sight.
 An oriental rug with tasty-looking fringe is a fun toy in the
mind of your Bully, but don’t leave her alone with the rug. I
suggest rolling up the rug for a few months. Aside from ruin-
ing the look of that expensive rug, a puppy can swallow fringe
and incur serious intestinal problems that require surgery.
 Got a priceless antique chair? Protect the rungs. Puppies love
chair rungs. Chairs make wonderful teething toys. Puppies are
also fast. I own a chair with rungs that is now decorated with
teeth marks. I would have bet money that the most recent
puppy was never alone with that chair.
 Make a spare room off limits to the puppy, and put rare furni-
ture, special rugs, or other precious items in the room until
the puppy is older. You can purchase baby gates to protect
the closed-off rooms.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Bulldog 57

Examining Crates: All-Purpose
Doggy Dens
Contrary to popular opinion, a crate isn’t a jail cell. Some people
see a crate and see bars. Dogs, on the other paw, see a crate as a
den — a safe place to take a nap or get away for a while. If you’ve
had a dog before, you know that dogs frequently hide under chairs,
tables, or even beds for their naps. A dog may even squeeze
between a sofa and the wall. Think den when you shop for a crate.
Most puppies adjust quickly to crates. Some crying and whining at
night is normal, so grit your teeth, and remember that this, too,
shall pass. As long as you’re feeding your puppy well, keeping her
warm and dry, and letting her out for potty breaks, let her cry.
She’ll stop eventually, honest.
Although most dogs quickly adjust to crates, occasionally a dog will
not adapt to crating. I had a dog who seemed to have panic attacks
when she was crated for long periods of time and another who
didn’t mind sleeping in a crate, but the door needed to be open.
Fortunately, neither of these quirks started until after housetraining.
If you have a dog who objects to the crate after a reasonable try,
don’t force the issue. She can always hide under the bed for privacy
or sleep with you in the bed, if that is acceptable. Remember that
after you allow her to sleep with you, cuddling is a hard habit to
break for your dog. See Chapter 9 for information on crate training.
Numbering the advantages
Purchasing a crate for your Bully provides him with a comfy den
and also benefits you. Take a look at the following list, and see
whether you can be persuaded to give crates a chance:
 A crate gives your puppy a snug place of her own.
 Traveling is easier with a crate. When you’re visiting Aunt
Betsy, your dog is safe and snug, and your aunt’s furniture and
rug are free from dog hair.
 Crate training prepares a dog for any time when she may
need to stay overnight at the veterinarian. A vet visit can be
stressful, but if your Bully’s used to a crate, chances are she
may relax and fall asleep, even in a strange place. When I
board my dogs, I frequently request that their crates go in
the indoor kennel run with them.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
58

 Crates are small, easy-to-clean areas. If your puppy has an
accident in the crate, the mess is a snap to clean. Wire crates
frequently have a removable tray that makes cleanup even
easier.
Deciding on the den
Crates are moderately expensive, but they can last a long time,
depending on the aggressiveness and activity of your puppy when
housed in the crate. Talk to your breeder about the right size of
crate for your Bulldog. Here are a couple things to keep in mind
about crate size:
 Your dog needs to be able to stand up in the crate, turn around
easily, and lie down stretched out. Cramped crates can make
your Bulldog uncomfortable and unhappy.
 On the other hand, a crate that is too large isn’t the cozy den
your dog wants, and the vastness may encourage him to sleep
at one end and turn the other end into his bathroom. 
You may even want two or three crates — one for the car, one for
the family room, and one for the bedroom. Crates make wonderful
bedside tables.
Plastic
Plastic crates or pet carriers provide more protection when travel-
ing with or shipping your Bully. In the event of an accident, plastic
crates play an even more important role in keeping your dog safe, as
they’re usually very durable and offer more impact resistance than
other types of crates. Plastic crates also allow ventilation and func-
tion well at home in the air conditioning or heat (see Figure 5-1).
Wire
If you aren’t much of a traveler or don’t plan on shipping your
Bulldog out of town, wire crates (my preference) are a good stay-at-
home hostel for your puppy. In winter, cover the top and sides of the
wire with a blanket or a custom-made cover to create a cozy den,
and in warm weather, flip the sides up to provide air circulation.
Solid metal
Stay away from solid metal crates with your short-nosed pup.
Solid metal crates tend to hold heat, and your Bulldog can become
overheated.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Bulldog 59

Figure 5-1: The versatile pet carrier can be used as a dog bed, dog crate, and
travel crate.
Buying Beds for Bulldogs
Beds come in wonderful colors and fabrics, and coordinating your
dog’s bed with your other household furnishings can be fun. Bed
selections range from foam and beanbag beds all the way to real
innerspring mattresses. Many beds are made specifically to fit
crates. Look for a bed with protective covers that contain any
doggy dribbles and accidents. 
The main thing to keep in mind when selecting a bed is durability.
Of course, your Bulldog’s comfort is important, but you don’t want
to get him a bed that he can destroy in a matter of minutes. When
shopping for a dog bed, no matter what kind you decide on, make
sure it’s tough enough to stand up to your Bully!
If you choose a foam bed, make sure that the cover surrounds the
foam completely. If your Bully can reach the foam, he can eat it.
Then it’s goodbye bed, hello emergency surgery.
You may want to save the expensive mattress until your puppy is
an adult. Many puppies chew on whatever is available, and I’ve
seen beautiful wicker beds reduced to a pile of twigs.

Collars and Leads and
Harnesses, Oh My!
Leads and collars help keep your puppy under control when you’re
out in public. Remember, not everyone loves dogs, so if you have
control of your dog, you’re less likely to scare other people. You
can also keep your Bully from harm or pull him away from some-
thing he shouldn’t be into when he’s on a collar and lead.
Collars
Collars come in a wide assortment of colors with matching leads. A
simple, flat nylon collar works well as a first collar. Adjustable col-
lars are good investments because as your puppy grows into adult-
hood, he will need his collar let out; adjustable collars prevent
multiple runs to the nearest pet store for a bigger collar.
If you want a permanent, more expensive collar for your Bully, wait
until he’s full grown.
Here are a few specialty collars you may see in the stores:
 Buckle collar: The buckle collar is often considered “daily
wear” for dogs. It’s a good bet for growing Bulldogs because
it’s easy to adjust the size of the collar as the dog grows.
Buckle collars also stand up well to hard use and stay on
Bulldogs well (see Figure 5-2A).
 Slip collar: The slip collar is a type of training collar designed
to tighten around the dog’s neck when the dog pulls too hard
on the leash. Some dogs respond well to slip collars, although
other dogs continue to pull so much that they are in danger of
choking themselves (one of the reasons why these collars are
also called choke collars). Consider using this type of collar
when training your Bulldog (see Chapter 10), but don’t use it
for daily wear (see Figure 5-2B).
 Prong collar: There are a variety of training collars out there,
depending on the dog and what he’s being trained to do. For
Bulldogs, the prong collar is fairly common, especially for
Bullies that are stubborn and undisciplined on a lead (see
Figure 5-2C). The prong collar looks a bit intimidating to some
people, but properly fitted and used, it won’t hurt your Bulldog
and will help you better communicate to him what you’d like
him to do. Work with a trainer to help get the right collar for
your Bulldog and to learn how to use it (see Chapter 10).
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Bulldog 61

 Martingale collars. These look a bit like a figure eight. The
larger loop has a metal ring at each end, through which the
smaller loop passes. The lead attaches to this smaller loop,
and that loop draws the large loop closed. It prevents the
collar from slipping over the dog’s head but will close only to
the size of the larger loop so that the dog can’t be choked by
the collar (see Figure 5-2D).
Slip collars, prong collars, Martingales, and other types of training
collars should never be left on your Bulldog when he’s not training.
They can injure your Bulldog if he’s unsupervised and gets into
mischief while wearing them.
Figure 5-2: Four different dog collars: buckle (A), slip (B), prong (C), 
and martingale (D).
Leads
Leads come in various lengths, but for training and walking 6 feet
is the most useful length. Purchase a practical nylon lead to match
your puppy’s collar (if you want) or a cotton lead if you can find
one. Many times cotton leashes are 40 feet long and may not be the
most sensible for training.

62

Leather leads
Leather leashes are a good choice. Leather is long lasting and
looks good on your dog. After the leather is broken in, it will be
supple and soft in your hand. Make sure to acquire the thinnest
lead you can. The wider the lead, the less flexible it can be.
Chain leads
For some strange reason, chain leads are still on the market, and
people buy them. You may think that a chain lead means your dog
is strong and powerful and shows everyone that you need a heavy-
duty leash to control your dog. In fact, chain leads are horrible to
use. These leads come with a little plastic or leather loop for your
hand, but the loop is just a handy way to make sure that you and
your dog stay connected. Most of the time, whether walking your
dog or training him, you need one hand on the actual lead — the
chain.
Chains are hard, unyielding, and bulky, and if your puppy makes a
sudden lunge forward, the chain may rip the skin off the palm of
your hand.
Retractable leads
If you live near a wide-open field or park where you can walk your
dog, you may want to use a retractable lead. Your dog may enjoy
the extra 15 to 25 feet of wandering room. I find these leads awk-
ward and annoying, but many people love the freedom for their
dog. Remember to reel your dog in at the approach of other dogs
or people.
Keep your dog close when you’re crossing a street. If your dog
gets too far ahead on a retractable lead, he may be in harm’s way. I
recently heard about a dog who was hit by a car and killed because
the owner let her dog walk ahead on a retractable lead.
Harnesses
A harness is another option but not one I recommend. Bulldogs are
strong, determined dogs, and a harness gives them a chance to
pull you along wherever they want to go. You don’t have the con-
trol over a dog in a harness — the dog controls you. A collar and
lead are a better choice.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Bulldog 63

Toying Around
Toys are some of the most delightful items to shop for. You can
spend all day looking at toys. The options are endless. Playful extras
for your dog come in all shapes and sizes. And size is one of the first
factors you need to think about. A toy that is too big is better than
one that is too small. Amazingly enough, dogs consider swallowing
just about anything, and you don’t want playtime to end in tragedy.
So when in doubt, go bigger.
Here are some facts on a few of the more popular dog toys:
 Tug-of-war toys are popular and teach your dog to grip, but
be careful. Bulldogs are bred to hang on and never let go. Play
at a level suitable to your puppy. Also, if you’re considering
advanced obedience with your Bully, don’t play tug-of-war
at all.
 The Kong is made of hard rubber and meant to keep your
puppy occupied for hours. By stuffing cheese, peanut butter,
or dog biscuits in the center of the Kong, you can amuse your-
self while your Bully tries to extract the food from the Kong. If
you’re planning to be away from the house for a few hours,
distract your puppy with a Kong. Kongs are also a great chew-
ing workout for your puppy. Cubes and balls that release food
when your dog knocks the toy around are alternatives to
Kongs.
 Plush toys may have larger plastic noisemakers buried deep
within their stuffing, but a determined dog can quickly disem-
bowel a toy to reach the squeaker. The part of the toy that
makes the noise is hard and may, if swallowed, become stuck
in your dog’s esophagus or block his intestine. Remember to
supervise play with noisemaker toys until you know how your
dog reacts to them.
Cutting out the squeaker in toys can prevent accidental swal-
lowing. One of my dogs insisted on gutting his toys to reach
the noisy part, so I finally starting cutting the squeakers out of
toys before I gave them to him. I must admit that desqueaking
ruins some of the fun but is much safer. You can also buy regu-
lar stuffed animals without the squeaker mechanism.
You don’t have to buy all your dog’s toys. Puppies play with almost
anything. Here are some homemade toys your dog will love:
 Give your dog a plastic gallon milk jug, and watch him bat it
around and bite it. 
 A whole carrot provides some fun as well as chewing exercise. 
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
64

 If your puppy is teething, sacrifice an old washcloth. Wet the
cloth, put it in a plastic bag, and place it in the freezer. After
the washcloth is frozen, take it out of the bag, and let your
puppy gnaw on it. 
 You can do the same thing with a tennis ball in an old sock.
Put the tennis ball in the sock, knot the sock to keep the ball
in place, wet the entire thing, and freeze.
 Knotted socks also make great toys for playing fetch. The
socks are easy to throw and retrieve. Sock toys are also easy
to wash and cheap to replace. The only problem may be that
your puppy can’t discern between your good socks and your
bad socks. Look at the situation this way: Your puppy is going
to chew, whether he’s ever seen a sock before or not. I know,
you’re not supposed to turn items of clothing into dog toys
because dogs don’t know the difference between the play
sock and your good socks. But you control the situation.
Puppies can teach you to be neat and tidy. Don’t leave your
good socks or other unmentionables lying around to be
chewed. Then use your old socks that would normally go in
the trash as recycled puppy toys.
Gauging Grooming Tools
When you’re on that shopping spree, remember to look for the
grooming tools needed to keep your dog neat and tidy. Chapter 8
goes into more detail about how to groom your Bulldog and tells
you exactly what you need.
Evaluating Food and Water Bowls
Choices abound in the area of doggy dishware. The following sec-
tions go over the three main types of dog bowls.
While you’re shopping for your dog’s dinnerware, consider a doggy
placemat for the bowls. Mats wipe clean and prevent water and
food from scattering all over your kitchen floor. Mats also come in
all kinds of wonderful designs.
Stainless steel bowls
Stainless steel bowls are relatively inexpensive and indestructible
dishware that can be thoroughly cleaned. Many stainless steel
bowls also have rubber on the bottom to prevent skidding. Wash
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Bulldog 65

these bowls in the dishwasher regularly to ensure the cleanest
dishes for your Bully.
Plastic dishes
Plastic dishes are cheaper than stainless steel but don’t provide
the durability of the stainless steel models. Plastic is also harder to
clean and may retain stains and odors, and plastic may irritate your
Bully’s sensitive face and lips. Additionally, when your Bulldog has
finished his dinner, he may decide to finish off his bowl, seeing that
it is a dandy teething toy.
Ceramic bowls
Ceramic bowls may tempt you with the vast array of colors and
sizes with wonderful designs and clever sayings. Ceramic is heavy
enough to prevent spilling. It is breakable, so be careful. If you
decide on ceramic bowls, make sure that the paint and glaze are
lead free.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
66
Preventing spills in the crate
Consider these for your dog’s crate instead of a bowl:
 Water bottles: These bottles clip on the side of wire crates, and your dog licks
the end of the tube to make the water flow. The benefits include spill prevention
and cleanliness of the water. Water bottles are also great when traveling. Big
dogs may have a hard time getting all the water they need with a water bottle,
but for a short trip, the bottle is ideal. The bottle can also be perfect for your
Bully puppy.
 Stainless steel buckets: If you want to help prevent spills when your dog grows
up, attach a small stainless steel bucket to the side of the crate. Some bowls
also fasten to crates, and plastic crates frequently come with small bowls
attached to the door.

Bringing Your Bulldog Home
In This Chapter
 Picking up your Bulldog
 Showing your Bulldog the house
 Meeting other family members
 Setting up a schedule
 Detecting possible problems and sensible solutions
You chose the perfect Bulldog, and now the time has come to
pick him up and bring him home. Remember, this process is
new and strange for your Bully. Imagine how you’d feel if someone
picked you up, took you away from your home and family, and set
you down in a strange place where you didn’t know the language.
This chapter gives you the ins and outs of introducing your Bulldog
into his new home and family and preparing yourself for things your
Bulldog may do when he’s exposed to his new life for the first time.
Bringing Home Bully
You don’t want to be rushed, so plan to pick up your Bulldog on a
weekend, when no one works or has school. If the timing is right,
and you can pick your Bulldog up at the start of a vacation, that
situation is even better. The exception to the vacation situation is
Christmas. Many breeders won’t even let people take puppies
during the holidays. (See the sidebar “Christmas isn’t the season
for a new pet.”)

Whenever you pick up your Bulldog, take along a small crate (or
size-appropriate carrier) or a cardboard box for the ride home.
Line the carrier with newspapers or a towel or two. If you’re bring-
ing home a puppy, you should get the following from the breeder:
 Your puppy’s three-generation pedigree
 A health record for your Bully
 Food for two or three days
 A toy or two (optional)
You should also expect that your breeder will give you support.
Knowing that you can call your breeder whenever you have a ques-
tion or problem is important. Support gives you peace of mind, as
well as help when you need it.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
68
Christmas isn’t the season for a new pet
Christmas is the worst time to get a dog. Puppies make a great gift idea, and you
can picture your children’s faces when they open a box filled with the adorable
puppy with a cute bow around his neck. Greeting cards and holiday commercials
show puppies in stockings and under the tree, making the puppy seem like the ideal
gift. Even though the family may be home, the trouble with the Christmas season is
too much excitement and activity. The puppy may be overwhelmed and, in all the
rush, ignored.
A housetraining schedule may be virtually impossible to establish, and your new
dog may find it hard to adjust to his new place filled with friends and relatives. Your
Bully needs a chance to be quietly introduced to the immediate family and to get to
know the rooms of the house. Also, the chances of “excitement urination” increase
with the addition of many people to meet and play with.
Besides not having an established schedule, the more people in your house, the
more the chance exists that your puppy may be given “just a tiny piece” of cheese,
turkey, or candy. A puppy’s digestive system is sensitive, and with strange foods
and strange people in a strange place, your puppy can have diarrhea or an upset
stomach causing vomiting. The puppy doesn’t need the added stress, and neither
do you at this already-busy time of the year.
If you think that a dog is the perfect holiday surprise, take a picture of the dog for
under the tree. Give a fancy gift certificate or a collar and lead. Wrap up a book on
dog care, and plan to pick up the dog after the New Year. This presentation will make
your entire family happier.

Giving Your Bully the Guided
House Tour
Note the word guided in the header above. Don’t just open the
door of the house and let your Bulldog roam unattended. Your pup
will have plenty of time later to have a little adventure on his own.
For now, remember that everything is totally new to him. He needs
guidance:
1. Give your puppy a “pit stop” in the yard before taking
him into the house.
When you get your Bulldog home, make the first stop the
yard. In a new or strange environment, even adult dogs
may need to heed the call of nature. If you’ve chosen a spe-
cific area of the yard you want to use as a doggy bathroom,
be sure that is where you set him down when you first
come home.
2. Take him in to his food and water dishes.
Have a bowl of water waiting for him. Show him the bowl,
and give him a chance to have a drink. Put a few pieces of
kibble or a small spoonful of canned food in his bowl. Don’t
worry if he doesn’t eat it. Sometimes puppies won’t eat at
first. Remember, this time can be stressful. The bite of food
is just to let him know that this spot is where he dines in
the future.
3. Take him to his crate, and put him inside.
If he’s already used to a crate, you may want to shut the
door for a few minutes and let your Bulldog relax. If you’re
not using a crate, put the puppy in the box or room where
he’ll be sleeping, and let him explore.
4. Return the pup to the yard. 
Although showing the dog around may not have taken long,
now is a good time to take your dog back outside. Your
puppy may have gone when you set him down in the yard
before you brought him into the house, but puppies don’t
have control of their bladders yet, and excitement can
make them have to go.
If he relieved himself earlier, return to that spot in the yard.
Returning to that spot helps your puppy smell where he
went before and reminds him of what he’s there to do. If he
goes, tell your Bully how wonderful he is. If you have a
treat in your pocket, give it to him. Then you can go back
into the house for further introductions.
Chapter 6: Bringing Your Bulldog Home 69

Getting to Know the Kids
If you have children, chances are you don’t need to make formal
introductions because they went with you when you picked up the
puppy. Still, follow these basic rules for interaction between chil-
dren and puppies:
 Teach your children to approach any animal quietly and
slowly. No running and no grabbing.
 Teach your children to be gentle. A puppy isn’t a toy. Children
should gently stroke the puppy — soft pats, not hard thumps.
Don’t pull ears or tails or legs.
 Supervise interactions with younger children at all times.
Young children may not understand about being gentle.
 Never leave a baby alone with any dog. Puppies can nip;
nails can scratch; and a baby isn’t a dog’s toy any more than
a puppy is a baby’s toy.
 Educate your children on how to pick up and hold a puppy.
Don’t grab the dog around the middle and haul her around.
Slip a hand under the puppy’s chest and hold the hindquar-
ters with the other hand. Hold the puppy gently but firmly
against your chest. If a child is too small to hold the puppy,
supervise a cuddle session with the child sitting down and the
puppy in her lap.
 Remember that puppies, like small children, need naps.
Your children may want to play with the puppy all the time.
Make sure that you allow rest periods when your puppy can
have an uninterrupted nap in his crate.
 Depending on the age of your children, enlist them in the
care of the puppy. Kids can take the puppy out and give him
his meals as part of their chores. Taking care of an animal is a
good way to teach responsibility.
Just remember that the ultimate responsibility belongs to the
adult. The puppy needs regular outings, meals, and fresh
water. Providing dog care is up to you if your children fail to
provide it. Your dog shouldn’t suffer when children forget
their dog duties.
Meeting the Other Pets
If you have other pets, make proper introductions. You want your
puppy and your other pets to get to know one another with a mini-
mum of stress for everyone involved, especially you!
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
70

Here are some tips for introducing your pup to other dogs:
 Supervise the meeting in the yard — not in the house. The
yard is a bit more neutral.
 If you have multiple dogs, let them meet the new addition one
at a time.
 Be careful and cautious in the beginning, but don’t leash the
resident dog. Sometimes a lead, especially if it gets pulled
tight, can make the leashed dog more aggressive or protective
than if he’s left loose.
 Older dogs have different reactions to a puppy, and you need
to know the personalities of your dogs. My male has always
joyously greeted new puppies. One of my females considered
all puppies hers to discipline as needed. Another of my girls
just generally loved all other dogs, and still another was just
amazed and bewildered at the small size of the newcomer.
If you have an adult cat or cats who aren’t used to dogs, take the
introductions slow, and be careful. You don’t want your puppy’s
first experience with a cat to be a scratched nose.
One idea is to find a friend with a cat-friendly dog and invite your
friend and dog over to the house before you bring home the puppy.
Although the cat may hide, this process helps her get used to the
idea of a dog.
When you finally bring your puppy home, put the cat in a room
and close the door. Let the puppy and the cat get to know each
other by sniffing at the crack under the door. When you let the cat
out, make sure that the puppy is in his crate or in an exercise pen.
Let the cat approach at her own pace, and encourage her to sniff
around the crate. The cat shouldn’t be threatened, therefore allevi-
ating potential problems. The other advantage of crating your dog
for the meeting is the cat won’t run and the puppy won’t be
tempted to chase.
Don’t rush things. When you finally let your animals meet without
a barrier, keep the following tips in mind:
 Hold the puppy for the initial nose-to-nose hello.
 If everything seems friendly, put the puppy down, and let the
animals interact. Continue to watch them.
 Don’t let the puppy bother the cat when she’s eating or in the
litter box.
Chapter 6: Bringing Your Bulldog Home 71

 Also, don’t let the cat wander over to the puppy when he’s
eating. Keep them separate during meals so squabbling over
food doesn’t occur.
 Make sure that the cat always has a way to escape the atten-
tions of the puppy. Cats can easily bound over a baby gate
into a safe room or leap up to a kitchen counter if that’s
allowed. Eventually, your cat and dog may become best
friends.
Your cats and dogs can become bosom buddies, but when it comes
to smaller pets, hamsters and guinea pigs are likely to become
lunch. Dogs are predators, and they look on small, rapidly moving,
squeaky animals as prey. Occasionally, you may read of a dog and a
guinea pig cuddling, but that situation is rare. Safeguard smaller pets
and birds by putting their cages up high so your dog can’t reach
them. If relocating the cage isn’t possible, make sure that your dog is
never left alone in the same room as the smaller critters. If you let
your bird or smaller pet out for playtime, put your dog in his crate,
or shut him in another room. No reliable way exists to teach a dog
not to chase (or kill) one of these smaller animals.
Setting Up Your Puppy’s Schedule
Your puppy thrives on a schedule. Housetraining schedules are
covered in Chapter 9, including suggested feeding and play times,
as well as nap times. Play is vital but equally essential is rest. Help
your children set a schedule for playing with the puppy and then
putting the puppy in his bed or crate and letting him sleep. Post
this schedule on the refrigerator door beside the housetraining
schedule. With younger children, set a timer or alarm clock so
playtime and naptime are observed.
Surviving the First Night
Although most puppies adjust quickly to a crate, your puppy may
cry at bedtime the first few nights in his new home. Whining is
understandable and natural. After all, you’re new; the house is
strange; and other, unfamiliar animals may be walking around. Your
puppy is away from his mom and his littermates and the people he
knew for the first eight weeks or so of his life. The surroundings
even smell different to your dog.
Here are some tips on how to make the first night with your new
dog a little more calm and stress free:
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
72

 Make sure that your puppy is well fed. Even a small meal
before bedtime can help your dog fight the late-night tummy
grumbles that may wake him and keep him from sleeping
soundly.
 Before bedtime, take your puppy outdoors. A final pit stop
ensures that your puppy isn’t crying because he has to go.
 Give your puppy a snuggly, soft dog toy to curl up with.
Remember your favorite stuffed toy when you were a child
and how it comforted you? Your puppy can get comfort out of
a toy as well.
 Make sure that your puppy has soft bedding. Provide enough
padding to make a nest and to keep your dog warm. A warm
environment is more conducive to dozing off than a cold, hard
crate bottom.
 Wrap an alarm clock that ticks in an old shirt or a towel.
Place the clock in the crate. The ticking sounds like a mother’s
heartbeat and can calm your jittery puppy.
After you’ve made sure that the puppy is well fed, dry, warm, and
comfortable, if he is still crying, harden your heart, grit your teeth,
and endure. Don’t take your puppy out of the crate and into your
bed unless that’s where you intend to let your dog sleep for the rest
of his life. I had a puppy once who was fine in his crate during the
day, but at bedtime, his cries were pathetic and loud. Twenty min-
utes passed each night for about a week before he settled down,
but it finally happened, and now he’s very attached to his crate.
Tackling Problems
before They Start
Have you heard the saying, “An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure?” It’s a concise way of saying that sometimes it’s
easier to stop a problem before it starts. Try to think about what
will happen in the future based on what’s going on now. For exam-
ple, the idea of sharing your bed with your adorable puppy may
appeal to you. Before you invite him to share your pillow, think
about what he’ll be like full grown. If you’ll want 60 pounds of dog
snuggling next to you, fine. If not, don’t start. The same goes for
being on furniture or begging at the table. What you start now, be
prepared to continue for the life of your dog.
Be firm and consistent in all your dealings with your puppy; call
your breeder if you have specific questions about behavior or
development; and memorize your veterinarian’s phone number.
Chapter 6: Bringing Your Bulldog Home 73

Follow those suggestions, and you should live through your Bully’s
puppyhood without acquiring too many gray hairs.
Examining the crate size
If, in spite of your closely followed housetraining schedule, your
puppy consistently has accidents in his crate, consider whether
his crate may be too big. Dogs generally don’t want to go where
they sleep, but if a crate is too big, a puppy can easily have a sleep-
ing area at one end and a bathroom area at the other. Insert a
divider into the carrier, or invest in or borrow a smaller crate so
your puppy has enough room for sleeping but not enough room for
a bathroom corner.
Throwing up
Is your puppy frequently regurgitating his food? He may be playing
excessively too closely to feeding time. An excited, full puppy may
need to empty his stomach. If your puppy is fine otherwise —
active, playful, and with no temperature — the food he eats may be
too rich for your puppy’s stomach. Not every food is perfect for
every puppy, and the food that his littermates thrive on may not be
right for your pup. Gradually change over to another food, over the
course of about a week. If problems persist, see your veterinarian.
Getting a grip
Nail clipping shouldn’t be a problem yet, but start now to get your
puppy used to having his nails clipped. Handle his feet every time
you pick him up. Hold a paw for a few seconds. See Chapter 8 for
more specific instructions on nail clipping.
Bulldogs are determined dogs, but they aren’t built for struggles.
Although you may be able eventually to get an adult of another
breed to stop fighting you when you’re cutting nails or holding a
foot, a Bulldog won’t stop. This struggle can lead to shortness of
breath (for your dog and maybe you too) and threaten your dog’s
health. Use patience and perseverance, but never use force with
your Bulldog, and don’t fight with your Bulldog over something for
so long that he is gasping for air.

W
hen you first get your Bulldog, you may feed him whatever
your breeder recommends or has been using. But you may
consider another food as your puppy grows and his lifestyle
changes. You may also find that your dog is allergic to ingredients
in some food.
Cruise the pet food section of your local supermarket or pet super-
store, and you quickly realize that feeding your dog can become
complicated. The cuisine in these stores includes dozens of
choices. Foods are divided into selections for puppies, adults,
active dogs, and seniors. Overweight dogs can enjoy chow and
treats especially for them, and even the dog with a little plaque
problem has a meal to help clean his teeth.
Ultimately, you decide how and what to feed your Bulldog. This
chapter helps you make an informed choice.

or what brand you go with; that’s a matter of personal choice.
Ultimately, what matters is knowing what is going in your dog. To
get an idea of what’s going into your dog, you need to pay careful
attention to the label on the food that you buy. This section gives
you some pointers on what to look for.

Listed in the first five ingredients of your dog’s food should be an
animal-based protein source: beef, chicken, or lamb. Ideally, one of
those proteins should be in the first position, because this position
generally indicates the main ingredient. Dogs eat just about any-
thing, but they’re primarily carnivores, so you want to make sure
that your Bulldog’s food consists mainly of meat.
Your dog’s food may contain ingredients called meat byproducts.
Meat byproducts may not sound appealing to us, but they’re
loaded with vitamins and minerals for your dog. These additives
don’t include hair, horn, teeth, hooves, feathers, or manure.
Another tip on discovering the right food for your dog includes
understanding preservatives. Preservatives, chemical or natural,
are substances added to foods to keep them from spoiling. You
may want to avoid chemical preservatives in favor of natural
preservatives, like vitamin E. But remember that natural preserva-
tives don’t last as long as chemical preservatives. They tend to
break down when exposed to light and air. If you prefer a food with
natural preservatives, buy smaller quantities, and store the food in
a cool, dark place.
Dog food manufacturers don’t have to list preservatives that are
already in the products they purchase to make the dog food. A
food that is called “preservative free” means that the manufacturer
hasn’t added a preservative. Preservatives may still be in the food.

The American Association of Feed
Control Officials (AAFCO)
The American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is the governing body
for all animal feed products and sets guidelines and procedures for pet food man-
ufacturers. This organization provides a system for developing laws, regulations,
standards, and enforcement policies for the manufacture, labeling, distribution, and
sale of animal feeds.
The Agriculture Department of all 50 states of the United States requires AAFCO
compliance with regard to manufacture and labeling. This labeling compliance pre-
vents false claims or statements, meaning that whatever is in your dog’s food is on
the label. A manufacturer must list the ingredients, in order, from the largest amount
to the smallest. Preservatives, if any, must also be documented. Please remember,
though, that the AAFCO regulations apply to quantity, not quality. You decide about
the quality of the protein in your dog’s food.

Another factor to consider when purchasing dog food is the filler,
which is what the manufacturer uses to bulk up the food. Not only
should the food be mostly meat instead of filler, but also some dogs
are allergic to certain fillers because the fillers often consist of addi-
tives that dogs aren’t designed to eat. Here are some common fillers:
 Corn is a cheap filler and frequently used in dog foods. I avoid
corn because my male is allergic to it.
 Wheat and soy grains are also popular but may also cause
problems due to allergies.
 Rice causes fewer allergic reactions and has become popular
for that reason.
What you do depends on your dog’s reaction to a particular food.
Making the Choice: Dry,
Canned, or Semimoist
When I started sharing my home with dogs, the accepted wisdom
was that after you found the right food, you should never, ever
change — a good food was a good food and should never be
switched for any other food. I know that this system still works for
a lot of dog owners. For example, if you look at the University of
Missouri’s Web site, it states, “Dogs aren’t people and are perfectly
content to eat the same food every day.” The Web site also states
that you shouldn’t change foods: “Pick one type and one brand and
stick with it.” If you buy into this philosophy, you can see that the
food that your dog eats is going to be an important decision. In this
section, I go over three of the basic categories that dog food falls
into.
Dry food is a popular choice among dog owners. This selection is
easy on your pocketbook, has a long shelf life, and gives your dog
something to chew. If you decide to leave food out for your dog all
day, dry food doesn’t spoil in the bowl. Even if your Bulldog
inhales his food with barely a thought for chewing, dry food is less
apt to stick to teeth and cause dental problems.
But although dry foods are a popular purchase selection for
humans, dogs love canned food. To your Bulldog, canned food
smells good and tastes even better. This type of nourishment may
have a larger proportion of meat than dry food, although canned
food probably still contains fillers. Canned food generally sells at a
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 77

higher price than dry. After opening a can, refrigerate the food, and
use it within a day or two. Don’t leave canned varieties out all day
in your dog’s bowl because the food spoils quickly. Canned food
also sticks to the teeth more easily and can cause dental problems.
Mix canned and dry foods to stretch the canned food and give your
dog a yummy meal. Canned food also gives you a method to hide
any medication you may need to give your dog. Your Bully will enjoy
the treat and have no idea he’s being medicated at the same time.

78
The diet of variety
Some breeders, through general reading and online discussion, suggest that feed-
ing the same food all the time isn’t the best option for your dog. Feeding the same
food all the time means that the digestive system produces the enzymes needed to
process that one particular food. If another food is given, the system can’t handle
it. For example, wild deer can starve to death in a hard winter even if humans pro-
vide food because the food isn’t what they’re used to, and deer can’t digest it.
Another argument is that longtime vegetarians may become ill if they eat meat, not
because the meat is bad, but because their systems aren’t used to dealing with
meat. That’s why if you need to switch dog foods, gradually mix the new food with
the old. This mixture gives your dog’s system time to adjust to the change.
Veterinarian Wendy Blount suggests feeding a variety of foods. Wendy practices in
Nacogdoches, Texas, and is residency trained in Small Animal Internal Medicine. Her
areas of interest in addition to internal medicine are nutrition and herbal medicine.
Dr. Blount combines dry and canned foods, never feeds the same food more than
two days in a row, and frequently adds fresh food as well. She offers several rea-
sons for this model: “The National Cancer Institute suggests that we [humans] need
a varied diet of fresh (nonprocessed) foods to prevent cancer. Yet we recommend
a steady diet of a single brand of processed foods for pets. And then we add to their
diets minute amounts of carcinogens. And cancer is the number-one killer of dogs.
How much sense does that make?”
Dr. Blount also notes, “Human medical research tells us that overexposure to cer-
tain antigens may precipitate food allergies in some predisposed individuals —
many veterinary dermatologists agree and recommend rotating the diet for healthy
dogs.”
And finally, Blount says, “Feeding a variety of wholesome foods may compensate
for individual variations in needs and/or unknown deficiencies in particular com-
mercial foods.”

The last option for dog food is the most expensive of the three
choices: semimoist food. This food is frequently formed into attrac-
tive shapes for humans (because your dog doesn’t care what it
looks like), so it looks like ground beef or a hamburger patty. Food
coloring gives the cuisine a meaty look. Read the label. Prominent
animal proteins and vitamins may abound, but so do sugar and
preservatives, and possibly flour, which all help the patty stay
shaped. Avoid any food that doesn’t look healthy for your Bully.
With skin allergies being a common problem in Bulldogs, adding
variety to your dog’s diet may be the answer. Check with your vet-
erinarian if you want to try diet variety with your Bully. For more
on this option, see the sidebar “The diet of variety.”
Cooking for Your Bulldog
The majority of dog owners make their food selection from the
wide variety of prepared brands, but some people cook for their
dogs, preparing their meals from scratch. If you decide that this
option is best for you, remember that your dog’s diet must still be
balanced. Cooking up some chicken and rice may help your dog
recover from an upset stomach, but the concoction isn’t a bal-
anced diet, and neither is a big, meaty bone, no matter how much
your dog enjoys it. You have to make sure that any diet you feed
your dog still contains the proper proportions of protein, fat, car-
bohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Consult an animal nutritionist
to make sure that the meals you cook for your dog supply the
nourishment he needs.
Discover all that you can about this method of feeding. If you
decide to cook for your dog, make sure that you have the time to
commit. Cooking from scratch isn’t a short-term project; your dog
can live for the next ten years — are you going to cook the entire
time? Think about storage space for ingredients and for prepared
food. If you cook up a big batch of food, make sure that your
freezer has room to hold the extras.
Many people who cook for their dogs use a meat base, such as
ground beef or turkey. A pressure cooker reduces bones to mush,
ensuring that your dog gets the calcium that bones supply. Add
potatoes or oatmeal and vegetables of your choice. Add vitamin
and mineral supplements after the food is cooked. An Internet
search turns up dozens of books that contain specific recipes, and
www.boxerlife.com/basics.htm lists cooking information and
recipes.
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 79

Considering the BARF Diet (No,
It’s Not as Gross as It Sounds)
Some Bulldog owners prefer feeding raw-food diets, like the Bones
and Raw Food or Biologically Appropriate Raw Foods (BARF) diet.
Most people don’t ride the fence when it comes to feeding raw.
People are either totally against it or totally in favor of it. Proponents
of raw food say that their dogs are healthier, with clean teeth and
gleaming coats.
The presence of bacteria in uncooked food presents the most
widely critiqued aspect of the raw method. Some people say that
the dog’s system takes care of these bacteria and that the dog’s
short digestive system doesn’t let the “bad stuff” stay in the body
long enough to do any harm.
If you decide to feed raw food, remember that your dog’s diet must
still be balanced. You may also add supplements. Suggestions vary
as to types of supplements, but most raw diets include vitamin
supplements and fish oil or flaxseed oil. The Holistic Guide for a
Healthy Dog, (Howell Books) by Wendy Volhard and Kerry Brown,
DVM, gives detailed information on proper foods and necessary
supplements for a natural diet; and Switching to Raw: A Fresh Food
Diet For Dogs That Makes Sense, by Susan K. Johnson (Birchrun
Basics), is an easy-to-understand book about how to feed raw.
Feeding raw definitely takes more effort than opening a can or
pouring some kibble from a bag. A general feeding pattern should
include the following:
1. Feed raw, meaty bones each morning.
2. Feed a variety of foods at night.
3. Alternate among organ meat, muscle meat, and 
vegetables.
Vegetables need to be processed in a blender or food processor
before you feed them to your dogs. The blending helps break up
the cellulose. Dogs don’t produce enzymes that digest cellulose, so
unless you break the vegetables down, they pass through the dog’s
system untouched. If you decide to add grains, like rice or oatmeal,
to your dog’s diet, cook them first. Cooked potatoes may also be
added for variety. You don’t need to cook every day. Make up a big
batch of your vegetables or grains, and freeze in individual portions.
You need freezer space and a source for your raw foods as well. In
larger cities, pet-supply shops may stock frozen raw bones, turkey
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
80

necks, tripe, and packages of raw meat mixed with vegetables. If
this option isn’t available to you, find a good butcher.
Jean Hofve, DVM, offers suggestions for feeding raw at her Web site
(www.littlebigcat.com). Yes, the site is primarily about cats,
but you can find information about dogs as well. Dr. Hofve recom-
mends pounding or grinding bones to alleviate the dangers of bone
splinters and the difficulty in digesting the bone, especially for
puppies.
An alternative to raw meat and bones is to cook chicken legs in a
crock pot. Cover the legs with water, and cook on low for 24 hours.
The extended cooking time reduces the bones to mush. Check to
make sure that no pieces of bone remain, and cool before feeding.
Ask your veterinarian for his opinion. If he is against a raw diet, but
you intend to feed raw, have your veterinarian run a blood scan on
your Bulldog before you start the raw diet. Repeat the scan every
six months. This monitoring allows your veterinarian to regulate
the effects the diet has on the health of your dog. You don’t want
the issue of food to be the reason you lose a veterinarian who
understands Bulldogs.
When to Feed Your Bully
You’ve decided to feed your Bulldog a premium kibble, a quality
canned food, or a homemade diet. You’ve talked to your breeder,
your veterinarian, and possibly a nutritionist. Now you need to
decide when to feed your dog. Most breeders suggest feeding twice
a day, no matter which meal method you choose. With an older
dog, feeding twice daily gives him a chance to get more out of each
meal because as a dog ages, his digestive system may not be as
efficient. Remember that feeding twice a day means splitting the
daily ration, not doubling it. You don’t want an overweight dog.
An advantage to feeding at specific times is that if your dog isn’t
feeling well, skipping a meal is frequently the first sign that some-
thing is wrong with your Bully. With regular meals, you know right
away if your dog isn’t eating. If you have multiple dogs, being able
to separate them and watch over mealtime ensures that all dogs
get the proper nutrition and portion.
You may like the idea of free feeding — measuring out your dog’s
daily allowance of food and letting him choose the time to eat. For
some households, this procedure works just fine. I can hardly
imagine a Bulldog leaving morsels for later after he’s found the
food, but I suppose that it’s possible.
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 81

Free feeding doesn’t work with home-cooked meals, the BARF diet,
or the canned-food diet. The food gets dried out and crusty and
provides a cozy home for bacteria, which can lead to illnesses in
your dog
If you have two or more dogs, free feeding doesn’t work because
you never know who is really getting all the food. One dog or the
other may dominate and get more of, if not all, the food. Also, if
you free-feed, medicines or supplements are harder to regulate for
each dog because with multiple dogs, you need to make sure that
the right dog gets the added ingredients.
Whatever you decide to feed your Bulldog, make sure that he
always has access to fresh, clean water! Because Bulldogs may
overheat, water is especially important. Change the water in your
dog’s bowl at least twice a day, and remember to wash the bowl.
Water isn’t clean and fresh if it keeps going into a slimy bowl.
Giving Your Bully Doggy Treats
No matter what kind of diet your Bully follows, a time will come
when you want to give him a treat. All my dogs get a dog biscuit at
bedtime, as well as one whenever they go out. After breakfast, each
one gets a carrot stick. I carry treats in my pocket when I walk my
female so I can practice sits and downs. At lunchtime, the dogs line
up for their bite of cheese, and when we have pizza, they expect to
share the crusts.

The luxury of liver treats
People who show their dogs frequently use cooked liver to get their dogs to look
alert and happy in the show ring. Whether you show your dog or not, liver makes a
great and healthy treat. Liver contains no sugar, flour, or preservatives, and you can
freeze the extra, thawing just what you need.
You can make liver treats in two different ways.
1. Put your liver in a microwave-safe dish.
2. Cover the liver with a paper towel.
3. Microwave for 3 minutes on high.
4. Turn the liver piece(s) over, and cook for an additional 3 minutes on high. 
The result is a lot like shoe leather.

Special treats for dogs abound. The store shelves line with all
kinds of goodies, from hard biscuits to soft, bone-shaped treats to
all kinds and shapes of rawhide chews. Rawhide chews, however,
must be approached with some caution, as discussed in “Looking
at Chew Toys,” later in the chapter. Breeder advice is no rawhide
for your Bully.
Sharing People Snacks 
with Your Bully
It’s fun to give our dogs little bits of people food now and then, and
most dogs can make you believe that they’re starving when food is
around. Sharing is fine within reason. Just remember a few point-
ers when sharing snacks with your Bully:
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 83
5. Cut the leather — I mean, liver — into small pieces, and use for training or for
the occasional treat.
A second way to prepare liver treats is by using garlic. Dogs love garlic, and the
smell tempts even the fussiest of eaters — not that there are many fussy Bulldogs.
1. Rinse the liver.
2. Put the meat in a pan of cold water.
3. Bring the water to a boil.
4. Boil for 20 minutes.
5. When the liver has finished boiling, place it on a cookie sheet.
6. Sprinkle the meat with garlic powder.
7. Bake in the over for 20 to 30 minutes at 300 degrees.
8. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven.
9. Let the liver cool completely.
10. Cut the meat into bite-size pieces.
11. Store the leftovers in the freezer.
12. Make sure to thaw the liver treats before giving them to your dog.
For easy cleanup, cover your cookie sheet with aluminum foil, and put the liver on
the foil. When the liver has cooled, you can remove the foil and just toss it in the
trash.
Remember: Don’t overfeed liver treats. Too much liver can cause loose stools.

 Limit treats to no more than 10 percent of your dog’s total
diet. If your dog is gaining weight, cut back on the treats, and
add a bit of exercise. Dogs soon discover when their behav-
iors produce treats, so try cutting the size of the treat in half.
Adding exercise is harder with a Bulldog than, say, a Labrador
Retriever. You don’t want to stress your dog or get him over-
heated, but maybe you can work in another trip around the
block.
 Pay attention to the kind of treats you’re giving your dog. A
bit of lean turkey at Thanksgiving is fine, but don’t overdo the
generosity with the rich gravy and spicy stuffing. A spoonful
of pumpkin is a healthy treat, but pumpkin pie isn’t.
 Share your popcorn. When you make popcorn for an evening
snack, set aside a helping that is unbuttered and unsalted for
your dog.
 Add vegetables to the diet. Carrots make a tasty chew toy, or
throw a few green beans on top of your Bully’s food. You’ve
given him a treat with no fat and fewer calories.
 Give your dog some pupsicles. Most dogs love the occa-
sional ice cube. Get your Bulldog used to munching ice
because the cool cubes can help keep him from overheating
on a hot day.
When your Bully is behaving, pop out a pupsicle, and watch
his eyes light up. After your Bulldog adjusts to munching on
cold cubes, alternate pupsicles and regular ice cubes. For
details on how to create these treats, see the sidebar “Making
pupsicles.”
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
84
Making pupsicles
One of my friends encourages the ice cube habit by making what she calls 
“pupsicles”:
1. Mix a can of low-sodium chicken or beef bouillon with a can of water (use the
same can the broth came from).
2. Pour broth mixture in ice cube trays, and freeze.
3. Cover with aluminum foil to prevent heavy freezer burn.
You can also use dry bouillon cubes. Just reconstitute according to directions, mix
with water, and freeze.

What Not to Feed Your Bully
In addition to all the fun foods you can share with your Bully,
another list exists of foods that your Bully should never ingest. I
know that your Bully buddy can be convincing, but never, ever give
your Bulldog any of the following items:
 Alcohol: Don’t give your Bully alcoholic beverages. A drunken
dog isn’t funny, and even small amounts of liquor can result in
alcohol poisoning, which can lead to death.
 Chocolate: Chocolate contains theobromine, which can be
fatal. The darker the chocolate, the greater the danger.
The American Animal Hospital Association notes that 2 to 3
ounces of baking chocolate can kill a medium-size dog. And 1
to 11⁄2 pounds of milk chocolate can have the same effect.
Don’t panic if you drop a chocolate chip on the floor or your
dog steals an Oreo, but keep that box of holiday chocolates
out of reach of your dog, and be extremely careful with baking
chocolate.
 Coffee and tea: Both contain caffeine and theobromine.
 Macadamia nuts: Don’t serve these treats to your dog. Eating
too many Macadamia nuts can cause paralysis. Symptoms
include a mild fever and an upset stomach. Depending on the
size of the dog and how many nuts he eats, within 12 to 24
hours, his back legs become paralyzed. The front legs are
either unaffected or minimally affected, but the back legs no
longer work. Within 72 hours, the dog is fine, as though noth-
ing ever happened.
The good news —the paralysis goes away without lasting
effects. The bad news — some dogs may be euthanized
because they’re misdiagnosed as having a severely injured
disc, particularly among breeds where injured discs fre-
quently occur. So keep the Macadamia nuts away from your
Bully, or better yet, switch to cashews, which don’t harm your
pooch. I had a dog who managed to reach and devour an
entire bowl of cashews. She suffered no ill effects.
 Nicotine: Tobacco products are deadly, so make sure that
your Bulldog doesn’t eat any cigars, cigarettes, snuff, or chew-
ing tobacco.
 Onions: No one wants a Bulldog with onion breath, but that’s
not the only reason to keep your dog away from onions.
Onions can cause hemolytic anemia. Symptoms of this type of
anemia include pale mucus membranes, loss of energy, and
lack of appetite. Your dog may also feel the cold more and try
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 85

to find a warm corner. The dog may have a fever or a faster
heart rate. Treatment may include a blood transfusion and/or
vitamin B-12.
 Xylitol: Xylitol, an artificial sweetener, can cause a sudden
drop in blood sugar, resulting in depression, loss of coordina-
tion, and seizures.
Looking at Chew Toys
Dogs enjoy a chewing workout now and then, but be careful what
you offer your Bulldog. If you give your dog a real bone, make sure
that it’s fresh and raw. Never give your dog any kind of cooked
bone, because bones can splinter and cause serious intestinal
damage. Make sure that the bone is large enough for your dog as
well. A dog can easily swallow a small bone that may get stuck in
his throat or cause an upset stomach. If you want to give your dog a
real bone, stay with him while he enjoys it so you can intervene if a
problem arises. Another disadvantage of real bones is that they’re
messy. You aren’t going to want to let your dog have a real bone on
the living room carpet.
If you have more than one dog, bones may cause a fight. Dogs get
possessive of bones, so if you have multiple dogs, make sure that
you feed bones separately to prevent problems.
Nylon bones are an alternative to raw bones because they don’t
break or splinter. Small shreds of nylon that your dog may swallow
pass harmlessly through the digestive tract. Nylon bones also get
bristly at the ends, acting a bit like a toothbrush as your dog chews,
removing plague buildup. Nylon bones don’t stain carpet or floors,
and dogs are less possessive of a nylon bone. Again, make sure that
the size fits the dog.
Hard rubber toys, especially the kind with a place to hide cheese
or peanuts (Kongs), may also give your dog chewing exercise, but
be careful that your dog doesn’t bite off large chunks of the toy
and swallow them. Different dogs treat toys differently. Supervise
your dog until you know what kind of a chewer he is.
Rawhide comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but for Bulldogs,
rawhide is dangerous. Bulldogs tend to chew and soften rawhide
and then pull more into their mouths, never actually biting off a
piece. When they swallow, this long piece of rawhide can become
impacted in the intestines (or bowel), causing problems. Take the
end of a rawhide and pull it away from your Bulldog, and you’re
apt to pull a piece 12 inches or longer out of his mouth. Stay away
from rawhide.

Special Diets for Your Bulldog
The important concept to remember is that not all foods are right
for all dogs. If your Bully has large, smelly stools, look for another
food. If a food is causing a minor problem, trial and error can help
you find a better food. Your friend’s recommendation for her
Bulldog may give your dog diarrhea. If your dog’s reaction to food
is frenzied scratching and chewing at himself, loss of weight, and
skin and coat problems (coat is dull and dry), he may have food
allergies, and you need to visit the veterinarian. Your vet may put
your dog on a one-protein food, like duck or venison, and then
gradually move to foods with another ingredient or two until the
cause of the allergy is determined.
Remember that your dog needs to be happy, healthy, and hungry
for more of what you’re feeding. If your Bulldog’s coat is shiny and
glossy; if his stools are firm and small, with no obnoxious odor;
and if he is healthy, the food you chose is doing its job. Don’t be
afraid to ask questions, and do some research to find the ideal
meal for your Bulldog.
You may have seen the senior pet foods on the shelves in your
local grocery store, supercenter, or pet store. Senior foods are for-
mulated to help control weight in an older dog whose metabolism
has slowed with age. Stores may also carry “light” foods for less
active dogs, no matter what their age. If you decide to switch to a
food for seniors, pay attention to your dog’s skin and coat. Some
dogs develop dry, flaky skin because of the reduced amount of fat
in the food. Mixing a senior food with a regular food may help, or
you may need to add a tablespoon or so of oil to your dog’s food to
help keep his skin moisturized.
Many reasons exist for why your dog may not be able to eat regu-
lar dog food or even a meal you prepare yourself. Fortunately,
many dog food companies produce specific canned and dry diets
especially formulated for specific illnesses and diseases:
 Cancer: Dogs with cancer typically need a food with a moder-
ate amount of fat, moderate to high protein, and low carbohy-
drate, with increased amounts of omega fatty acids.
 Diabetes: If your dog has diabetes, he may need to switch to a
diet high in complex carbohydrates. Ask your veterinarian for
a recommendation.
 Heart disease: Dogs with heart problems may benefit from
diets low in sodium.
Chapter 7: Feeding Your Bulldog 87

 Kidney disease: As dogs age, kidney problems may trigger
special dietary needs. Except in acute kidney disease, a low-
protein diet is no longer considered ideal. What does seem to
help kidney disease is less phosphorous in the diet, and low-
protein foods are also usually lower in phosphorous than reg-
ular diets. Contrary to popular belief, high-protein diets don’t
cause kidney damage.
For a dog with kidney disease, your veterinarian may recom-
mend canned food over dry because canned food contains
more water, and the more water your dog gets, the better. If
you still prefer to feed dry, add as much water to the food as
you can and have your dog still eat it. Adding water to the
canned food is a good idea, too.
 Liver disease: Put a dog with liver disease on a low-protein
diet.
 Pancreatitis: A dog diagnosed with pancreatitis needs a food
low in fat.
 Staining: Staining is a common complaint from Bulldog
owners. Tear stains and saliva stains (pink or red staining
of the neck, face, or feet) may derive from your Bully’s diet.
Feeding a different brand of food may help. Chicken- and
turkey-based diets seem to cause fewer issues than lamb
or beef, but the individual dog’s metabolism plays a role.
If you’ve been feeding your dog a homemade diet, and he now
needs a special diet, you can still make meals instead of buying
the commercial product. Visit www.2ndchance.info/homemade
diets.htm for recipes for special diets for dogs with heart, kidney,
urinary tract problems, diabetes, obesity, and allergies.

 Bathing your Bully
B
ulldogs aren’t difficult to groom; you don’t need a lot of fancy
brushes, combs, or clippers. But Bulldogs still need occasional
grooming — all dogs benefit from brushing and baths. Grooming
time also allows you to check your dog for cuts, scrapes, or unusual
bumps. Regular clipping of nails and checking of eyes and ears can
catch any little problems before they become big problems.
Proper grooming keeps your dog an appreciated member of the
family (and a better smelling one to boot). Grooming equals good
health, and the time you spend grooming your dog helps to form a
bond between you and your Bully.
Brushing Your Bulldog
Brushing removes dead hair and skin, spreads oil throughout the
coat, and stimulates blood flow.
Bulldogs don’t have elaborate coats or thick fur, so you don’t need
a lot of different types of brushes to brush your Bulldog com-
pletely and thoroughly. To brush your Bulldog properly, however,
you need the following items:
 Squirt bottle for water: Spritzing your dog’s coat before
brushing keeps the hairs from breaking. Add a dash of
Listerine to help clean the coat.

 Bristle brush: Boar’s bristle brushes are expensive, but they
last forever.
 Curry comb: This comb’s stubby rubber nubs loosen and
remove head hair.
Brush from the nose to the tail. It’s best to have your Bulldog
standing when you’re brushing him, especially if you’re getting him
ready for a show and want his coat to look as nice as possible (see
Chapter 11, and also the sidebar in this chapter, “Putting your
Bully on the table”). When your Bulldog is standing, certain por-
tions of him are more easily reached. However, if your Bully isn’t
going to a show and prefers to recline during the brushing process,
that’s perfectly okay.
To brush your Bully:
1. Spritz him lightly with water from your squirt bottle.
2. Use the curry comb to work through his fur to remove
loose and clumped hair.
3. Use the bristle brush to brush away all the loose hair. 
Don’t forget to brush his legs and tail!
Your bed makes a wonderful grooming surface. I recently discov-
ered this fact because the weather was way too hot outside to set
up the grooming table. We have a fairly high bed in our bedroom,
and we keep a sheet over the bedspread because one of our dogs
sleeps with us. The dog needed grooming, so I hoisted my boy up
on the bed and brushed away.
The bed provides a big surface for both you and your dog. You can
sit on the edge of the bed and easily groom his feet. The bed also
offers a soft platform to encourage your Bully to roll over on his side
for brushing. That is virtually impossible on a grooming table with-
out ending up in an argument. After grooming your dog, pull off the
sheet, shake the hair in the trash, and throw the sheet in the washer.
Make sure that you use a rubber mat or some other type of non-
skid surface for a base when grooming your Bully. You don’t want
your dog to panic because he can’t grip a smooth surface, and you
don’t want him sliding off.

Getting the Skinny on Skin Care
The Bulldog breed tends to be more susceptible to skin problems
than other breeds. Problems range from dry, flaky skin to serious
allergies to mange. A dog with fleas may end up with hot spots. But
Bulldogs’ face wrinkles require the most attention and care in the
grooming process.
Wrinkles are beautiful
Wrinkles give a Bulldog his characteristic look and add to his
charm, but these face folds need to be kept clean and dry. Some
dogs’ wrinkles need cleaning only a couple of times a week, but
other dogs need their wrinkles cleaned every day. Because air
can’t get into the bottoms of the wrinkles, skin in the fold can
become red, raw, and infected. If you notice a smell or any goop
in the wrinkles, you need to clean them more often.
Use a damp cloth, cotton balls, or baby wipes. Baby wipes with
aloe are a good choice because the aloe soothes the skin and helps
moisturize, or you can mix water and dog shampoo. If you use
shampoo, mix a tiny drop of it in a cup of warm water, and use a
cotton ball to dab the wrinkles with the solution. Afterward, make
sure that you rinse the wrinkles well to prevent further irritation.
No matter what you choose to clean your dog’s face, make sure
that you thoroughly dry the wrinkles when finished. Use some
petroleum jelly in the deep wrinkles to soothe the skin and add a
moisture barrier.
Popular drying agents like powders or cornstarch aren’t recom-
mended for Bulldogs because they can clump on and irritate the
skin.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 91
Putting your Bully on the table
At the top of my shopping list is a grooming table. The older I get, the more I don’t
want to kneel to do anything. A grooming table also helps you control your dog. He
can’t easily scoot away from you during the grooming process if he’s on a table.
Planning on showing your Bully? Then you need a grooming table. If you don’t plan
to show, you may not need a specific grooming table, but do think about what you
can use in your own home: a rubber mat on top of the clothes dryer, a work bench
in the basement or garage, a sheet on top of your kitchen table.

When wrinkles appear raw or irritated, use a general antiseptic
ointment or a diaper-rash cream to treat the area. And while you’re
taking care of the wrinkles, put a dab of petroleum jelly, vitamin E,
or Bag Balm on your Bully’s nose to help maintain the softness.
Acne — not just for teenagers
Your Bulldog doesn’t have to be a teenager to get acne. Wrinkles
make a lively place for bacteria to grow, and this growth may result
in pimples on your dog’s face and chin. Plastic dishes can also
cause this problem, so I recommend using ceramic or stainless
steel. Most of the time, minor breakouts respond to gentle washing
and a daily treatment of antibiotic cream. You can also use a prod-
uct called Oxyio, available in most drugstores. Acne that doesn’t
seem to go away merits a visit to your veterinarian. He may pre-
scribe an oral antibiotic for your dog to help clear up the problem.
Alleviating skin allergies
If your Bully has skin problems — redness, flakiness, itchiness —
for no apparent reason that you can think of, he may have aller-
gies. Canine allergies — just like human allergies — stem from
foods, molds, and pollens and cause itchy skin. Discomfort can be
seasonal and chalked up to “something in the air.” Continuous irri-
tations can result from a number of reasons, but your dog’s food is
the most likely culprit.
If you suspect that your Bully’s skin problems are due to allergies,
make a trip to the veterinarian. He may run tests to pinpoint the
cause of your dog’s discomfort, or he may suggest a food made of
all one product. These special diets have just one ingredient, like
duck. Then, by gradually adding other foods, you can determine
the exact cause of the allergy. Allergy food testing is a lengthy
process, and fortunately, most dogs don’t need to go this route.
Halting hot spots
A flea-saliva allergy in your dog may drive him to continuous biting
and scratching, which can create hot spots. Hot spots are red, weep-
ing sores caused by dogs biting their own skin. I use a triple antibi-
otic salve on hot spots, and the ointment seems to work. When hot
spots don’t get better within a few days or continue to get larger,
check with your veterinarian.
You also need to manage the flea infestation in your dog. For more
on controlling fleas, see “Making fleas flee” in Chapter 14.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
92

Managing mange
Mange, a persistent, contagious disease of the skin causing inflam-
mation, itching, and loss of hair, poses another skin problem in
Bulldogs. If you suspect that your dog has mange, take him to the
vet right away to determine what’s causing the mange and what
treatments are needed.
Two types of mange, both caused by tiny mites, may affect your dog:
 Sarcoptic mange: Symptoms accompanying Sarcoptic mange
include intense itching and, with advanced cases, skin lesions
and hair loss. Treatments are done internally with a prescrip-
tion of ivermectin and externally with sulfur dips to help ease
the irritation. Using a monthly flea and tick preventative effec-
tively protects your pet against mange-causing mites. Make
sure to disinfect the dog’s bedding thoroughly or simply
throw it away.
 Demodetic mange: The second type of mange passes from
the mother to her puppies and affects puppies between the
ages of 3 and 10 months. With Demodetic mange, you may
notice hair loss around your dog’s eyes, lips, or forelegs.
Extreme cases include hair loss at the tips of the ears. A spe-
cial shampoo may be recommended, and ivermectin comes
in handy again. Demodetic mange, if not widespread on the
dog’s body, may go away on its own. If the mange spreads sig-
nificantly beyond small, localized areas, treatment can last up
to one year. Veterinarians diagnose Demodetic mange through
skin scrapings, but this type of mange doesn’t cause the itch-
ing that Sarcoptic mange does.
Bringing up the rear
Your dog’s tail doesn’t need much attention, but on some Bulldogs,
the tail sits in a pocket that can harbor bacteria. If your dog has a
tail pocket, meaning that there’s a thick fold of skin surrounding the
base of his tail, make a special effort to keep that pocket clean and
dry with daily wiping. For a tight tail pocket, you may need to use
cotton balls instead of a washcloth or a baby wipe. After washing
the tail pocket, make sure to dry it thoroughly. Rub a bit of antibi-
otic cream in the pocket for added protection. A bit of petroleum
jelly acts as a moisture barrier, just as it does for wrinkles. If the tail
seems irritated or infected, your veterinarian can give you an anti-
fungal ointment, as tail infections are frequently yeast infections.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 93

Puppy Pedicures
If you walk your dog on paved roads or cement sidewalks, you may
be one of the lucky few who never need to clip or grind his dog’s
nails. Otherwise, like the rest of us, include nail care in your
grooming routine.
If, for some reason, you can’t deal with trimming or grinding your
dog’s nails, hold your head high, and take your Bully to a groomer
for his pedicure. No matter how those nails get short, make sure
trimming happens. Long nails spread your dog’s foot (splaying)
and make walking difficult.
Cutting the nails
Nail trimming doesn’t rank high on your Bulldog’s list of most pop-
ular events for dogs. However, your Bully doesn’t feel pain when
you clip his nails unless you accidentally cut the quick (a tiny vein
that runs through the center of your dog’s nails), so don’t let your
dog tell you otherwise.
From the puppy stage, start trimming and get your Bully used to
having his feet handled, even when you’re not preparing to do the
nails. Hold a paw in your hand. Give your pup a treat, tell him he’s
wonderful, and then let him go so that he associates paw handling
with happy moments.
You need to buy a pair of special nail clippers intended for dogs.
You get what you pay for, so invest in a good set. Ask your breeder
or your veterinarian for recommendations.
When you do start to clip the nails, use sharp clippers, and cut
quickly. Do one foot at a time in the following pattern: Trim nails,
give treat, release to play, repeat pattern. The pattern helps your
dog release the anxiety associated with trimming. The break time
allows you to recoup between trimmings, especially if you’re wor-
ried about hitting the quick.
Cut nails where they curve around to a point to avoid the quick. (If
the thought of hitting the quick terrifies you, take off tiny amounts
of the nail at first.) See Figure 8-1 for proper placement of the cut
for nail trimming. If your dog has white nails, you can see the
quick, which somewhat resembles a smaller, dark nail inside the
actual nail, and avoid cutting it. If your dog has black nails, you’ll
need to make an educated guess, but the general rule is never cut
the nail past the pad of the foot. With regular trimming, the quick
shrinks, and over time, the risk of hitting the quick lessens.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
94

Figure 8-1: Where to trim your Bulldog’s nails to avoid cutting the quick.
If you do happen to hit the quick, use a bit of styptic powder (avail-
able at your local pet-supply store or at a drugstore) to stop the
bleeding. If you plan to trim your Bulldog’s nails yourself, purchase
styptic powder to have on hand in case of bleeding. If bleeding
occurs, coat the end of the nail generously with styptic powder,
and keep the paw elevated until the bleeding stops.
Grinding the nails
If, for whatever reason, you just can’t cut the nails yourself, don’t
feel bad. I can’t either. I can rip fleas apart with my nails, clean
oozing wounds, and scoop out eye and ear gunk, but I just can’t
clip nails. However, I can grind nails.
A grinder is a motor-driven tool with an abrasive round drum.
Think of a small version of a power sander, and you have the idea.
The grinder acts as a file and grinds away the unwanted nail. Many
dogs who hate having their nails cut don’t mind the grinder at all,
and when using a grinder, the risk of cutting the quick is elimi-
nated. (Ask your breeder to recommend a grinder.)
Get your dog used to the grinder gradually. Turn on the grinder
when you’re grooming your dog, so he gets used to the motor’s
noise. Hold a paw against the handle of the grinder, and let him feel
the vibration. When your dog seems comfortable with the noise

Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 95

and shaking of the tool, try a nail. Just as recommended with nail
cutting, grind one set of nails at a time, and take a break. Give
treats (offer a variety of treats). In no time at all, your Bulldog 
quietly lets you grind his nails without a fuss.
The “Eyes” Have It
Generally, the grooming process doesn’t include regular eye care.
But occasional dust and dirt particles from the outdoors cause eye
irritations. To rinse out your Bully’s eye(s), squirt a mild eye solu-
tion in the eyeball. Pet-supply stores carry many brands of eye solu-
tions, or ask your vet to recommend one. Eye problems greater
than the minor particle in the eye should always be referred to a
vet. A scratched or swollen eye with seeping requires a veterinar-
ian’s examination.
Tear stains, on the other hand, can be treated at home. Your
Bulldog’s tears run down his face and can leave stains. Not all
Bulldogs get eye stains, but if yours does, the discoloration isn’t
harmful to your dog. If you’d prefer your Bulldog’s face stain free,
check with a groomer or your veterinarian for stain-removing prod-
ucts, or try these helpful products and concoctions:
 Boric acid or ointment: Gently rub the stain with a piece of
cotton soaked in boric acid, or use a dab of boric acid oint-
ment, which you can find in most drugstores.
 Hydrogen peroxide and cornstarch: Make a thin paste of
hydrogen peroxide and cornstarch. Apply carefully to the
stain, let dry, and then brush off. Apply daily.
 Tear stain remover, diaper rash cream, and medicated body
powder: Clean the tear-stained area with the tear stain remover
dry. Apply a thin layer of diaper rash ointment, and dust with
medicated powder. Tears tend to roll off instead of staining
the face.
Ears to Good Health
Make checking and cleaning your dog’s folded-open ears another
part of your grooming routine. Potential infections grow anyplace
where air can’t freely circulate, so it’s best to keep your Bully’s
ears clean to prevent problems. You can buy ear-cleaning products
or use a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide. Gently clean the
earflap and just inside the ear.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
96

Never, ever push and poke into the inner ear of your Bulldog; you
can seriously injure him.
Ear mites, while not common, can be a problem with regard to ear
health, as they can cause redness, swelling, and bleeding from con-
stant scratching. Pay attention when your dog shakes her head or
scratches at her ears. These indicators relay messages of potential
problems. If you suspect a problem with your dog’s ears, schedule
a visit with your veterinarian.
The Whole Tooth and Nothing
but the Tooth
Tooth decay plagues humans more than dogs, but that doesn’t
mean that dogs aren’t susceptible. Bulldogs can develop plaque,
which, if not removed, hardens to tartar. Possible complications
from tartar include abscesses of the gums. Or the bacteria from
abscesses can circulate in your dog’s system and lead to pneumo-
nia or heart, liver, or kidney problems.
Brusha, brusha, brusha
If you start cleaning your dog’s teeth when he’s a puppy, he’ll soon
get used to the routine. Toothbrushing may not be your favorite
activity to share with your dog, but statistics show that 75 percent
of all dogs have some kind of periodontal problem by the age of four.
So include your Bulldog’s mouth and teeth in every health check.
Your veterinarian can give you recommendations on what prod-
ucts to use on your dog’s teeth and can show you the proper way
to keep your Bully’s teeth clean. To brush your dog’s teeth, you
can use:
 Gauze wrapped around your finger
 Pretreated wipes
 Smaller plastic brushes that fit over your finger
 Special dog toothbrushes
Most veterinarians and pet-supply stores also sell special pastes
that come in a variety of flavors for brushing your dog’s teeth. Make
sure that you use a paste made especially for dogs; never use human
toothpaste for your dog’s dental care.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 97

Professional cleaning
Eventually, your veterinarian may recommend a professional clean-
ing for your dog’s teeth. This procedure entails anesthetizing your
dog so that the vet or technician can remove tartar buildup and
clean and polish your dog’s teeth. If cracked or broken teeth are
found, they can be pulled during the procedure.
Not all dogs are alike, of course. Some dogs may need their teeth
cleaned every six months; others may go their entire lives without
a professional cleaning. Your veterinarian checks your dog’s teeth
during the annual checkup, but if you ever notice the following
problems, contact your vet:
 Different breath or more intense breath than normal
 Excessive drooling
 Lack of desire to chew on toys or bones
 Pawing at the mouth
 Trouble eating hard food
When treating older dogs, veterinarians usually recommend blood
tests before the cleaning to ensure the dog’s safety under anesthe-
sia. The blood tests may help your veterinarian detect other health
problems as well.
Bathing Your Bully: Water,
Water Everywhere
Your Bulldog may not need a bath often, especially if you keep him
clean with regular brushings and wrinkle cleanings, but one day
your dog and your bathtub will need to meet. Unless you have a
large stationary laundry tub in your basement, use your own tub
as the designated bathing area. Get organized, gathering every
item you need before you find and heave your dog into the tub.
Preparing the bathing area
Before you start your Bulldog’s bath, collect the following supplies:
 Baby wipes: Used for cleaning wrinkles.
 Cotton balls or swabs along with commercial ear-cleaning
solution: If you haven’t already cleaned your Bully’s ears on
the grooming table, choose bathtime as the time to do it.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
98

 Dog shampoo: Don’t use human shampoo, no matter how
much you like the smell — the pH balance in shampoo differs
for dogs.
 Flexible spray nozzle, pan, or pitcher: Attach the spray
nozzle to the faucet, or use a pan or pitcher to pour water
over your Bully. (Spray nozzles are easier to use and get all
the soap out of your dog’s coat.)
 Grooming apron or an old sweatshirt: This is for you to
wear. Be prepared to get wet. Your dog will shake one or more
times, and you will get wet.
 Hair dryer: Use either a special dog dryer or your own.
Remember to set the dryer on low or air only.
 Rubber mat: Prevents the dog from slipping in the tub.
 Stack of towels: Get more than you think you need. Use a
couple to kneel on, or get a pillow or a rubber pad to protect
your knees.
After you’ve gathered all your supplies and before you put your
dog in the tub, run the water to the desired temperature — warm
enough to be comfortable but not too hot. If you try to place your
pooch in the tub and the water runs too hot at first, you may scald
your dog’s paws, and cold water may shock your dog into a panic.
Test the water temperature on the inside of your wrist, just as you
do a baby bottle of formula. When in doubt, go cooler rather than
warmer.
Preparing your pup
Now go get the dog. Bathtime usually ranks at the bottom of any
dog’s list of favorites. Inevitably, your Bulldog sees right through
your loving voice and desire to pick him up for a simple cuddle and
knows to run and hide.
So you may have to put him on a lead, pick him up, or lure him with
treats to get him into the bathroom with you. But after you have
him cornered and you’re both in the bathroom, close the door. If
you own other pets, you don’t want them wandering in and distract-
ing you or the dog, and after you suds up your Bully, you don’t want
him escaping to spread suds and water throughout the house.
Ideally, avoid shampoo near your dog’s face, and clean the face
separately. Before you hoist your dog into the tub, you may want
to protect his eyes and ears:
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 99

 Some groomers recommend a drop of mineral oil in the eyes
to protect Bulldogs against soap, but others feel that the oil
just spreads the soap.
 Put cotton in your dog’s ears to prevent water and soap from
leaking in the ear canal. Cotton works if you can keep your
dog from shaking her head vigorously and dislodging the
cotton. So try the cotton if you want to, but if your dog per-
sists in shaking, just be careful around the ears. Use a damp
cloth to wipe the ears clean, and don’t use any shampoo at
all around the ears.
Because of your Bulldog’s short, upturned nose, water can easily
trickle into the nose and from the nose into the lungs. A Bulldog
can easily drown in a small amount of water. If you’re using a spray
nozzle, be careful not to get water in your dog’s nose.
Washing your Bulldog properly
Now you’re ready to begin bathtime:
1. Lift your dog into the tub.
No matter how low your tub, don’t allow the dog to climb in
on his own. Bulldogs slip easily and may hurt themselves.
2. After he’s in the tub, wash the face wrinkles first.
Use water only, and clean his face and earflaps. If you pur-
chased special ear cleaner, use that now.
3. Wet your dog all over.
4. Squirt shampoo on your hand, and begin to lather your
dog.
Scrub gently, paying close attention to dirty spots and 
sensitive areas of the body.
5. Rinse your dog thoroughly.
Rinse. Repeat. Rinse again; rinse a third time. And rinse
again. Leaving any trace of soap on your dog causes skin
irritation and itching.
6. Rinse him some more.
Drench areas around the tail, especially if your dog has a
pocket for his tail. Thoroughly douse your dog with water
behind the elbows, between the toes, and on his stomach.
Use some vinegar in the final rinse to get rid of any soap
scum and leave your Bulldog’s coat shiny and squeaky
clean.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
100

7. Let your dog shake off.
I prefer letting him shake while he’s in the tub. You’d be
amazed at how much water a dog can shake off. Hold up a
towel (or close the shower curtain), and let your Bully shake
that water in the tub instead of all over your bathroom.
8. Lift your dog from the tub.
Don’t let him scramble out on his own.
9. Dry your dog thoroughly.
Use a couple of towels to get him as dry as possible. Then
finish drying in one of two ways:
• When bathing in the summer, your Bulldog can air dry.
• Follow a winter bath with a thorough drying that may
include the use of a hair dryer. You don’t want your
Bully to chill.
If you opt for a hair dryer, and you don’t own a spe-
cial dog dryer, use the lowest setting possible. The
“air only” setting (if it’s an option on your dryer)
offers the best experience for your dog. Bulldogs
have very sensitive skin, and you can easily burn
your dog with too high a dryer setting.
Never cage-dry your Bulldog. Cage drying involves putting your
Bully in a crate with a dryer blowing hot air into the crate. Bulldogs
overheat in cage-drying situations.
After you clean and dry your dog, you may want to keep him
indoors to enjoy his clean, shiny coat. After he’s outdoors, the
odds increase that he’ll head straight for the nearest mud puddle.
Removing the sticky stuff
You may occasionally find that your dog gets into something that
you can’t easily get off. Here are some helpful household products
to remove the goo:
 Baby oil. Rub a small amount of baby oil on your fingers and
then rub into the stain.
 Hairspray. Soak hairspray on the spot and then peel or pick
off the sticky goop.
 Ice cubes. Use an ice cube to freeze the sticky spot. The sub-
stance becomes brittle and flakes off your dog’s coat. Be care-
ful not to hold ice too long on any one area.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Bulldog 101

 Nail-polish remover. Soak a cotton ball with nail-polish
remover and then apply to the sticky spot.
 Peanut butter. Try applying peanut butter on gooey 
substances.
All these ideas work, although my favorites include the ice cubes
and peanut butter. No matter what method you choose, make sure
that you protect your dog’s eyes and wash and rinse the spot(s)
completely. These products may cause skin irritations if left on
too long.
Part II: Living with Your Bulldog 
102
Bathing in a pinch
Your Bulldog desperately needs a bath, but you’re out of dog shampoo. What do you
do? Make your own. Try the recipes and hints below to get you out of those sticky
situations when shampoos and removers aren’t readily available.
Homemade shampoo
16 ounces Dove liquid dishwashing detergent
16 ounces water
16 ounces apple-cider vinegar
4 ounces glycerin
Combine ingredients in an old shampoo bottle (or large cup), and swirl together. You
can leave out the glycerin (which you probably don’t keep on hand), but in that case,
reduce the amount of soap. You can make shampoo for now and save some for later.
If you don’t want a large quantity, keep the recipe proportions the same but reduce
the amounts.
Recipe adapted from www.abigslice.com.
Oatmeal shampoo
If your Bulldog suffers from dermatitis, try making a shampoo that includes oatmeal.
1 cup oatmeal
1 cup baking soda
1 quart warm water
Mix oatmeal and baking soda, and pour into water. Oatmeal shampoo makes a
soothing rinse for your ailing Bully.

If your dog gets stuck with gum, tree sap, or road tar, remove all or
most of the substance before trying one of the items from the pre-
vious list.
Grooming allows you to notice anything out of the ordinary going
on with your dog, from lumps and bumps to rashes or areas of hair
loss. Use this time to check for external parasites as well. See
Chapter 14 for more information on parasites.

U
nless you plan on living outdoors for the entire life of your
Bulldog, you need to housetrain your pup — that is, teach
him where to “go.” This chapter deals with the different ways to
train your puppy to be reliable in the house and get your Bully to
do his business outside rather than inside. Be patient and consis-
tent, and housetraining may be easier than you thought.
Wait and get a puppy when someone can be around to train him. If
you anticipate that your puppy may spend most of the day alone
during the first few weeks that you bring him home, with no one to
let him out or help him understand housetraining, pick a time to
bring home your Bully when schedules allow for potty breaks for
your pooch.
Housetraining 101
A regular, consistent schedule helps train your puppy quickly.
Have a handy-dandy schedule to follow (see “Working out a train-
ing schedule,” later in this chapter), but remember that you’re not
dealing with a machine. That means that, although you may be fol-
lowing the schedule, your puppy follows his feelings (or urges).
Be prepared to make a few schedule changes to compensate for
your puppy’s individual quirks, but as soon as you settle on your
schedule (the sooner, the better), stick to it like glue. Puppies (and
adult dogs) like routine, and if your training methods are consis-
tent, your puppy achieves the routine he wants, and housetraining
runs more smoothly.

Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
108
Remember the following consistency tips when housetraining your
Bulldog puppy:
 In the beginning, always use the same door to go out to the
yard. Make sure that everyone in the family uses the same
door. By using this method, when your puppy is old enough to
let you know that he wants to go out, he’ll always go to the
same door.
 Use the same area of the yard. This trick helps your puppy
discover the smell of urine and know that he’s come to the
right place. Dogs rely on their sense of smell, so use this sense
to your advantage. Just make sure that the area you choose in
the yard is really where you want him to go.
Some friends of mine got a puppy in the winter and got in the
habit of taking him out on the deck and letting him go in 
the snow. As the weather warmed up, the snow receded, and
the dog, having been trained to the snow, followed the snow
line across the yard, each day having to go farther and farther
before he would go. The deck seemed like a good idea at the
time, but because dirt wasn’t available to catch and hold the
scent, the dog was convinced he had to go only on the snow.
 Keep your puppy warm and cozy at night. If your puppy
gets cold, he may wake up, and if he wakes up, he may have
to go out.
 No matter where your puppy goes, as long as it’s outside,
praise lavishly. Your neighbors may think that you’re crazy,
but make a huge fuss over your puppy when he goes. Give
him a treat. Play with him after he goes — but not before.
Puppies can be easily distracted, and if you take him outside
and start to play, he may forget to go until he’s back inside.
 Always go out with your puppy. After he’s trained, you can
open the door and let your Bulldog out in your securely fenced
yard, but right now, you need to go with him so you can guide
him to the right spot and praise him for doing what he does.
Initially, always take your puppy out on a lead. Puppies run
fast and can scoot under a bush or a porch before you know it.
If you’re ready to leave for work, you’re not going to appreciate
having to get on your hands and knees to retrieve your puppy.
Besides, if he’s on a lead, you can keep him in the proper area
and focused on the job at hand.
 Remember that during potty training feeding time plays an
important part in the schedule. As your dog gets older, you
may decide that you like the idea of free feeding — putting
down the daily amount of food and leaving it for your dog to
enjoy whenever he feels like it. This feeding option is your

choice, but while your Bully is a puppy and until he’s house-
trained, feed scheduled meals. This procedure helps you
know when he’s likely to need a trip outside. Also, regulate
treats. Too many treats or too much variety may lead to a
touch of diarrhea. Bulldog puppies truly can’t control diar-
rhea, and that means extra cleanup for you.
Working out a training schedule
No matter what method you decide to use when you housetrain
your puppy, a schedule makes the process easier on everyone. A
schedule means that every family member knows what to do and
when, and your puppy also quickly learns the schedule. You may
even want to write the schedule down and post it on the refrigera-
tor so everyone has a reminder of what’s next.
Puppies are small. That means that the rest of their body parts are
small too — including their bladders. Puppies can’t physically hold
as much for as long as an adult dog. Puppies also need to learn
control. A schedule helps them discover that control.
Puppies already have a built-in schedule. They need to go to 
the bathroom when they first wake up; they need to go 10 to 20
minutes after eating; and they need to go after a play session.
Considering that your dog’s a puppy, she may also have to go any-
time in between, but these times present a starting schedule for
your refrigerator door.
Your schedule should fit your family, of course, but may look some-
thing like this:

If your puppy sleeps soundly overnight, sleep in until 7:00 a.m. If
you go to bed before 11:00 p.m., though, be prepared to get up in
the middle of the night.
The sample schedule may look like a lot of trips out, and it is, but
remember that the fewer accidents your puppy has in the house, the
faster she knows that she needs to go outside when nature calls.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
110

Also, make up the schedule that fits your family’s lifestyle. If no one
comes home at noon, see if your schedule can be changed to accom-
modate the noon break, or recruit a neighbor. The same goes for the
3:00 p.m. outing. If you don’t have children, see whether someone in
the neighborhood can help. If everyone leaves the house by 8:00 a.m.
and no one returns until 6:00 p.m., you won’t be able to use a crate to
train your puppy, and you may try to use one of the other methods.
Keep up this routine until your puppy stops making messes in the
house and starts letting you know regularly when he needs to go
out. This regular notice happens before the puppy reaches 6 months
of age, but keep in mind that many puppies go through a “relapse”
period before they’re 1 year old, where they start having accidents
in the house again and need to be retrained. Don’t get discouraged:
It’s all part of the growing-up and maturing process that all puppies
go through. As long as you’re persistent and patient with your train-
ing, your puppy can become successfully housetrained.
Watching for the warning signs
Recognize the signs that your puppy is getting ready to go. Generally,
adult dogs are more apt to add these variations to the process.
Puppies frequently don’t realize that they have to go until they really
have to go. Still, any of these activities may give you a clue that the
time’s come to pick up your puppy and get outside now.
Look for these signals:
 The preliminary dance: Generally, your dog performs a prelim-
inary “dance” — usually quite short — before he needs to go.
 The sniff and circle: Most dogs tend to sniff a bit and circle
before they actually go.
 The back-and-forth pace: Your Bully paces back and forth;
usually, the length of the area paced gets shorter and shorter
until he finally goes. When outside, he may get close to a
shrub or tree.
 The whine: Another indicator — the whine. Listen for it!
Sometimes the whine can be subtle. When your dog is a puppy,
the whine can be a warning that he needs to go to the bath-
room. As dogs get older and we condition our ears to the
whine, we allow the noise to go on longer. Don’t ignore your
puppy’s cry for a bathroom break.
 The stance: Some dogs even like to stand by the door when
they have to go out. They don’t bark, whine, or make a sound.
If you haven’t seen your pup in a while, look for the stance at
the back door.
Chapter 9: Housetraining Your Bulldog 111

Considering and Conquering 
Crate Training
Unless you’re lucky enough to be home with your dog all day, you
probably need to set up a “bathroom break” system for your dog
for  when you’re away. If some member of the family can reliably let
your puppy out at regular intervals, use a crate for housetraining.
Crate training includes definite advantages. For starters, your
puppy prefers not to go where he sleeps. Second, if your puppy
does have an accident in his crate, he’s confined the mess to a
small, contained, easy-to-clean area, not in the middle of the living
room rug.
Dogs quickly establish routines; and if you follow a schedule of
times when your puppy runs around and times when he’s in the
crate, he soon knows to “hold it” until he goes out. See the section
“Working out a training schedule,” earlier in this chapter, for a
schedule that gives you information on when to crate your dog.
The disadvantage of crate training is that someone must regularly
be available to follow the schedule you’ve set.
A crate is a tool, not a way to ignore your puppy. A young dog
can’t wait for more than four hours before he has to go to the
bathroom. To make him wait longer means that he may pee in his
crate, and after that becomes a habit, housetraining your puppy
can be even harder.
Preparing for Paper Training
If crate training just isn’t feasible because of time constraints, you
may opt for paper training. Choose a room or an exercise pen to
confine your pup to one area. A laundry room or bathroom works
well because of the typical linoleum flooring, or you can mark off
part of your kitchen.
Be aware that your puppy may decide that linoleum is a wonderful
teething toy. I’ve never understood how dogs can get any kind of
grip on a smooth linoleum floor, but believe me, they can.
Cover the entire floor of the chosen area with several layers of
newspaper. You may want to put down a piece of plastic first to fur-
ther protect your floor in case any waste products soak through
the paper. If the area is large enough, include your puppy’s crate in
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
112

the space, with the door open, as a place for him to rest. Supply
water and several toys.
When you clean the area, remove the top couple of layers of paper,
leaving the lower layers. Enough scent remains to tell the puppy
where to go. You may want to take a section of soiled paper out to
the yard and stake it down so your puppy understands where to go
outside. After several days, cover a smaller area of the floor. If your
puppy consistently uses the paper instead of the uncovered part of
the floor, reduce the newspaper coverage again. Continue this
process until you’ve removed all the paper. Don’t try to rush the
process. You don’t want your puppy going on the exposed floor.
Take the process slowly and easily until you know that he under-
stands about going on the paper.
During this time, continue to take your puppy to his outdoor toilet
area when you’re home. By the time you’ve reached the stage
where no newspaper remains on the floor, your puppy should be
both old enough to hold it and make the connection that he needs
to be outdoors when he has to go. He isn’t ready for the run of the
house yet, but he’s well on his way.
Going Indoors Rather Than Outdoors
You may want to train your puppy to go inside. If you live in an
apartment on the tenth floor and you’re six blocks from the nearest
park or dog run, inside potty training is another option. Keeping
your Bully inside doesn’t mean that that you don’t have to train.
Just because your dog is an indoor dog doesn’t mean that you want
him using your entire apartment as one big doggy bathroom.
Papering the floor
Paper train your puppy by using the same techniques mentioned
in “Preparing for Paper Training,” earlier in the chapter, except that
you never totally eliminate the papers. Decide on where you want
your dog to always use the bathroom, and follow the above
method, ending by leaving enough paper to always accommodate
your dog. To help define and contain the papers, add a small
wooden or plastic frame.
Padding the tile
Puppy pads, which remind me of disposable diapers, are an alter-
native to papers. Pads are flat with a plastic backing and scented
Chapter 9: Housetraining Your Bulldog 113

to encourage dogs to use them as a potty area. Place them on the
floor, just as you would a newspaper. Unlike with newspaper, you
need only one layer.
If you think that you’d like to use pads for your Bully, large wash-
able pads are available for training. Pads come in different sizes: 
2 x 2, 3 x 3, and 4 x 4 (all measured in feet). I recommend one of the
larger sizes for a Bully. Pads are washed after each use and then
air-dried. You need four or five pads at the minimum so that you
have some to use when others are drying. The 3 x 3 pad runs about
$35, and the 4 x 4 is about $55. Although this option is certainly
more expensive than newspaper, the reusable factor is a great
touch. Each pad can be washed approximately 300 times.
Boxing the mess: Litter boxes
Dog litter presents another choice for your indoor dog. Dog litter is
different from cat litter, so if you decide to go for litter, make sure
that you buy dog litter. Dogs, especially males, tend to use their
hind legs to scratch and scuff the dirt — or, in this case, the litter —
after they’ve used the bathroom. Cat litter flies all over the place,
whereas the special dog litter doesn’t fly around as much.
Train your puppy to use a litter box in the same way you train to
use paper:
1. Place the litter box in your puppy’s enclosure.
2. Put papers all over the floor.
3. Cover the papers with a thin layer of litter.
4. Gradually reduce the area covered by paper and litter,
closing in on the litter box.
Using a crate also works for litter-box training. Follow the schedule
at the beginning of the chapter, except that instead of taking your
puppy outdoors, take him to the litter box. Remember that the
litter box isn’t a play area. Leave your puppy in the box for a few
minutes, but if he starts playing or digging, put him back in his
crate for a while and then try again.
If you plan to use a litter box, keep the container clean. As needed,
scoop the litter and waste, and add fresh litter. At least once a
week, empty the litter box, scrub it clean, and refill with fresh litter.
Unlike when you clean up an accident, an ammonia-based cleaner
is fine. After all, if the ammonia attracts your dog to the litter box,
that’s where you want him to go. See “Cleaning Up after Bully,”
later in this chapter.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
114

Teaching Your Bully 
to Go on Command
After you housetrain your dog, you may occasionally need your pup
to go to the bathroom quickly and on command, even if he’s not at
the door asking to go out. For instance, you may be going out for the
evening and want to make sure that he’s empty and comfortable
while you’re gone. Or when pouring rain keeps your dog from want-
ing to go outside, you need to be able to tell your dog to go.
Although some dogs never catch on, most dogs eventually make
the connection between a word or phrase and the act of urinating.
Start by choosing whatever expression you like: “Go potty,” “Do
your business,” or any saying you’re comfortable with.
I’ve read that you shouldn’t use the phrase “Hurry up” because if
you’re in the house and you’re telling a family member to hurry up,
your dog may think that you’re asking him to lift his leg. I happen
to use “Hurry up” or “Hurry and go,” and so far, I’ve never had a
problem indoors, but still consider the warning.
When you take your puppy out, use the phrase you’ve chosen.
When he goes, praise him. Use the phrase every time, and eventu-
ally, the idea sticks.
Chapter 9: Housetraining Your Bulldog 115
The battle of the sexes
The potty command works better with females, who are apt to be fussier about
where and when they go, than with males. Walk most boys anywhere near a tree
or bush, and they seem more than willing to take the hint. Boys don’t usually care
where they go.
Female dogs, on the other hand, can be picky. If human, they’d carry little tissue
toilet-seat covers with them. I once walked a female puppy for 45 minutes in the
pouring rain. We were in a strange place, so her scent was nowhere to be found.
Remember, nothing can be done when this situation happens. You can’t yell or jerk
the lead or do anything negative. You can plead with your puppy, but I know from
experience that does no good at all. You have to keep walking and get soaked and
work on teaching your puppy to go on command. Believe me, when she finally went,
an abundance of enthusiastic praise poured out of me!

Cleaning Up after Bully
Sadly, after a puppy does his business, his owner then has busi-
ness of her own: cleaning up.
Cleaning up indoors
No matter what method you use to housetrain your puppy, acci-
dents occur, which means cleaning time for you. A consistent
schedule for feeding, playtime, naps, and walks helps reduce the
number of accidents.
1. Start by removing as much of the mess as you can.
On carpeting, pick up solid waste.
2. Blot the area with paper towels.
If your puppy wets, fold several paper towels and place
them over the spot.
3. Step on the towels, and rock your foot back and forth to
blot up as much liquid as possible.
Repeat, repeat, and repeat until the paper towel comes up
dry. Owning stock in a paper-towel company may make you
feel better about the number of paper towels you use.
4. When most of the liquid is blotted up, apply your cleaner
of choice, and follow the directions.
To save some money, use old rags or cloth towels to sop up acci-
dents and messes. You may want to run the washer immediately to
prevent the stinky rags from lying around.
Never use ammonia-based cleaning products to clean floors. No
matter how thoroughly you clean and rinse, an odor residue
remains, and ammonia is a base component of urine. The trace of
ammonia odor in the cleaner may be undetectable to you, but you
can bet that your puppy smells it, and he will return to the scene of
the crime. The market sells dozens of products designed specifi-
cally to deal with dog-accident stains and odors. Oxygen-based
cleaners also work well. In a pinch, use white vinegar and club
soda to help with stains. If the accident occurs on linoleum or tile,
wipe up the problem and then use a cleaner.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
116

Cleaning up outdoors
Figure outdoor cleanup into your duties as well. No matter how
much you love your dog, you’re not going to want your yard to be
one big litter box, and no one loves stepping in what the dog’s left
behind. If you want to enjoy your yard, or if your children play in the
yard, invest in a set of pooper scoopers — long-handled implements,
with one half being a bit like a dustpan and the other side having
either a rake-type head or a flat blade like a small shovel. Scoops
make quick cleanup possible without having to bend over. Then
deposit the waste in a lined trash can or into a doggy septic system.
A doggy septic system is easy to install. Just dig a hole anywhere in
your yard (preferably out of the way) and place the system in the
hole. These systems depend on enzymes that turn the waste into
liquid that leaches away into the ground. The cost of one of these
systems runs between $40 and $70.
The drawback to septic systems for dogs is that they don’t work in
cold weather because the ground is frozen.
Chapter 9: Housetraining Your Bulldog 117
Are you your dog’s maid?
Many books tell you to never let your dog see you clean up. Supposedly, cleaning
up after your pet teaches your Bully that you’re his maid. I’m not clear on the rea-
soning here. First of all, I am my dog’s maid. I’ve yet to see him wash his bedding,
sweep up hair, or wash his own bowls. And I’ve never noticed that watching me
clean up makes him go in the living room instead of outside.
I put my dogs elsewhere if one of them has an accident, but the reason isn’t because
I don’t want them to watch. While you clean up after a puppy, you can’t watch the
puppy, and believe me, your dog doesn’t need much time to get into trouble or to
leave another puddle or pile while you’re cleaning up the first one. Put your pup in
his crate so you can concentrate on cleanup.
If an adult dog has an accident for some reason, I’m not happy. I hate coming home
from dinner at a wonderful restaurant and having to clean up a mess. So I get the
dogs out of the way. I’m not in a good mood, and I don’t want to take my frustration
out on the dogs. And dogs being dogs, they like to know what you’re doing down on
your hands and knees. They like to get their heads and paws right in your space to
check everything out (because being on the floor naturally means that you want to
play). I don’t need their help at that point, nor do I want to play. So they get shut in
another room or put outside until I’ve cleaned up, and I can take a deep breath and
be happy to see them again.

Using the bag system for pickup
If your yard is small, and you choose to walk your puppy, you still
need to pick up the puppy’s waste. Carrying a set of pooper scoop-
ers with you on a walk isn’t practical, so carry plastic bags for
cleanup. Recycle the plastic sleeves that cover your newspaper,
plastic bread bags, and plastic bags from the grocery store. You
can also purchase small bags, called scrap bags, at the store that
easily stick in your pocket.
When your dog goes, take out a bag and put your hand in it; pick
up the waste; and then pull the bag forward, over your hand and
the waste (turning the bag inside out). Tie the bag closed, and
throw it in the trash.
If you’re reusing bags from the grocery store or newspaper, make
sure that they’re free of holes before you use them or take them
with you on a walk. Do I need to say why? Yuck!
You may want to take an opaque bag from the grocery to put the
individual waste bags in. I don’t know about you, but our walks can
get long, the dog can go several times, and I prefer not to be seen
swinging multiple sacks of excrement in my hand. The grocery bag
at least masks the mess until you get home.
Although this system may gross you out at first, trust me, it
becomes second nature, and you don’t have a choice. If you have a
dog, part of your responsibility includes cleaning up after him. No
one else wants the job, and if you’re walking in a public area, no
one should have to worry about stepping in your dog’s business.
Also, think about your neighbors. Leaving little “surprises” in their
yards isn’t the way to build rapport.
Try to walk your dog to a neutral area before he goes, or if that
isn’t possible, steer him to the grassy area between the sidewalk
and the street instead of letting him wander onto a neighbor’s
lawn. Even if you pick up, your neighbor may not want your dog
going on her property. If none of these options are convenient, stay
in your own yard until your Bully has gone; then go for the exercise
part of your walk. (But still, don’t forget the bags.)
If the bag method truly bothers you, even with the protection of
the opaque bag, use disposable cardboard kits with small handles.
The contraption works like a small scoop, and the handles close
and seal the box for throwing away. The disposable kit costs more
and isn’t as handy as stuffing a few bags in your pocket, but the
choice is yours.

Chapter 10
Mastering Good Manners
and Basic Commands
In This Chapter
 Adjusting to a collar and lead
 Teaching basic commands
 Attending puppy classes and day care
 Contacting the professionals
You don’t need to have a champion obedience dog, but your
dog should know basic good manners. Many untrained dogs
are unhappy, and usually, so are their owners. Dogs are pack ani-
mals and rule followers. A dog with no understanding of the rules
is confused and unsure of himself. He may try to make his own
rules or lead the pack, which in this case is your family.
A Bully with good manners knows when, if ever, she’s allowed to get
on the furniture, to beg at the table, and so on. Your dog should also
know to let people go through doors first. The more rules your dog
knows, the more secure she’ll be, knowing that you’re in charge.
This chapter covers basic training tips; how to solve problems; the
importance of socialization and getting your dog out to meet other
people and dogs; and, if you face a difficult behavior problem,
when and where to seek professional help.
A Few Things to Keep in Mind
While Training
For general socialization, take your puppy places. Carry her into
the bank with you. The tellers may pet her and even give her
treats. Go to a mall, and take a walk around outside (most malls
ban dogs from inside). People think that puppies are cute, and

Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
120
someone may want to pet her. Give her treats. If you don’t have
children, find children in your neighborhood who may like to play
with your puppy for a while.
Here are a few general tips that you can apply to all the training
ideas in this chapter:
 Always stop on a positive note. If your dog isn’t “getting” the
new lesson, go back to a command she knows how to do. If
your dog always sits promptly, end the lesson with a sit. Give
a treat and a lot of praise, and go back to training when you’ve
both rested.
 Don’t be afraid to try commands because you don’t think they
work. With practice and plenty of treats, you can train your
Bully to obey your commands.
 During training time, stuff your pockets full of treats, and
always have treats on hand for rewards. You don’t want to ask
your Bully to do something and then go find the treats. He
may forget why he’s getting the treat.
 Think of a release word to let your dog know that he can stop
whatever you had him doing. Make your release word happy
and short. Many people say “Okay” or “All right.” Whatever
you use, be consistent. Don’t say “Okay” one day and “That’s
fine” the next.
Following the Leader: Lead 
and Collar Training
The first step in training your Bulldog is getting your little darling
used to wearing a collar. At first, purchase an adjustable, flat,
buckle nylon collar because this type of collar is inexpensive, and
your puppy soon outgrows it. For more on buying collars for your
dog, see Chapter 5.
Collaring the culprit
Your Bulldog needs to be comfortable wearing a collar because a
collar and lead keep you connected to your Bully when you go for
a walk, to the vet, or to the bank. A Bulldog (at least at full size) is
too big for a cute little tote bag. If you want to go somewhere with
your Bully, you will both be more comfortable if your Bulldog
moves under his own power. Also, the collar is an excellent tool for
grabbing your Bully when you need to.

Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 121
To start out, buckle the collar loosely around your Bully’s neck
(that is, the collar must be tight enough to not fall off your dog, yet
not be so tight that it presses into his neck), and let him get used
to it. At first, make sure that you supervise your pup. He may want
to wriggle out of the collar by rubbing or scratching it off. You
don’t want him to get stuck on a piece of furniture without anyone
around to release him. After your Bully adjusts to the piece of
fabric around his neck, feel free to leave the collar on all the time.
Attach your dog’s rabies tag and identification tag on his collar. If
you lose him, the ID tag may assist in bringing him home.
Being gentle but firm with the lead
After your puppy accepts the collar, attach a lightweight lead to
the collar, and let your pup drag the leash behind him. Keep an eye
on him during this process to prevent the lead from catching on
nearby objects, getting tangled, or being chewed by your dog.
When your puppy finally gets used to the lead, pick it up by the
end. Start moving away from your pup, calling her as she comes.
Keep the lead loose, and don’t drag your dog. Encourage her to
walk with you by using treats and a lot of praise. Keep training ses-
sions short and positive. Your first walk may be just down the
driveway, but those first steps are a beginning.
Be patient. Don’t fight with your dog. Just remember to have a
pocketful of treats and to set aside a lot of time. When you start
getting impatient, stop any lesson instead of continuing a battle of
wills with your pup.
Knowing the Basic Commands
Having a dog with manners is a bonus. The basic commands, like
Sit, Come, Down, and Stay, can make living with your dog more
pleasant. You can teach the basic dog commands, but not every
method works with every dog or for every owner/trainer. If you
don’t fully understand a particular method, or you’re not comfort-
able, you can’t teach your dog effectively.

I have a “haunch” you can 
teach your Bully to sit
The Sit command is one of the easiest and most useful commands
to teach your young Bulldog. Encourage your Bully to sit by using
food. Find his favorite treats, and get your Bully’s attention.
1. Take a treat, and show it to your dog.
2. Tell him to sit.
3. Move your hand back over his head.
He follows your hand and the treat back, tipping his nose
up and sinking down on his haunches.
If you hold the treat too far above your dog’s head, your
Bully stands up and tries to reach the goody or stands on
his hind legs. This error in technique may teach your dog
the wrong command or to put his paws up on you for the
treat. You want him to sit, so keep your hand low.
4. Praise him, and give him the treat.
5. Repeat this process several times. 
6. Then end the session.
Work on Sit four or five times during the day, keeping sessions
short and treats plentiful, and always end on a positive note.
Before long, your Bully is eagerly sitting whenever you give the
command. The Sit command can easily be worked into your every-
day routine. Tell your Bulldog to sit, and you can
 Easily snap on his lead instead of trying to catch him as he
bounces with delight at the prospect of a walk.
 Check his ears for dirt.
 Lift a paw and clean off mud. This command comes in handy
when bringing in your Bulldog from the rain.
 Put his food bowl down. Having your dog work for his supper
never hurts. Food is an excellent motivator.
Come to me, my Bully!
Come is another of the basic commands. You don’t always want to
go get your Bulldog when you need him. You’d like to say his name
and the command, Come, and have him respond reliably. Begin
teaching Come almost immediately. Here are your first steps:
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
122

1. Call your puppy in a happy, excited tone of voice.
2. Back away from him.
3. Odds are good he bounds after you.
4. Pet and praise him, and give him a treat.
You can practice this feat under different circumstances:
 At mealtimes, call your Bully. His reward is his bowl of food.
 After he’s used to a collar and lead, work with him on the lead.
Again, call him in a happy tone, and run backward away from
him. When he comes, reward him.
 As you enjoy walks together, and your Bully is beginning to
understand the command Come, call him when he is dis-
tracted, sniffing a bug, or just wandering in the grass. Say his
name; call him; and give the lead a gentle tug. Don’t haul, jerk,
or drag him. Encourage him with your voice and with treats.
When you’re at the point where your Bully comes to you in the
house and on a lead, start practicing in the yard. To begin:
1. Leave the lead or a long rope attached to the collar.
2. Call your pup.
3. If he comes, praise him, and let him go back to whatever
he was doing.
You don’t want him to think that when he comes to you,
playtime is over. Coming to you is just a break and a
chance for a cookie.
4. If he doesn’t come at first, pick up the trailing lead; give a
gentle tug, and repeat the command.
After he comes, praise him, and let him go back to what he
was doing.
Don’t ever call your dog for unpleasant news. (If you want to punish
him, go to where he is.) Don’t call him to give him medicine. Don’t
call him for a bath. Don’t call him because you’ve just found one of
your good shoes that he’s partially eaten. If he is digging a hole in
the middle of your prized petunias, call him, and when he comes,
pat and praise him. Don’t punish him because he’s destroyed your
flowers. Punishing at this point turns into punishing him for coming.
Praise him for obeying, and replant the flowers later.
Call your Bully for dinner or a walk. Call him for a grooming ses-
sion if he enjoys being brushed. Call him for no reason at all, and
give him a treat when he obeys. If you’re patient and consistent,
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 123

and never call your Bulldog for unpleasantries, your dog comes to
you whenever you call, no matter what he’s doing.
Teaching the Down command
Before working on this chapter, I checked seven training sources
and came up with five different methods for teaching the Down
command, and they all work. Many people combine methods to
find one that works for both them and their dog.
Some methods require some form of physical manipulation, like
pulling or pushing, and with a Bulldog, the struggle may turn into a
contest of wills and strength.
Because food keeps a lesson happy and doesn’t result in a physical
battle, I use it to teach the Down command. Here’s how I like to
teach Down to my Bullies:
1. Start with your dog in a Sit.
2. Show your dog the treat.
3. Move your hand slowly down in front of your dog and
slightly away, giving the Down command.
4. With luck, your dog slides into a Down.
5. Make sure to praise and reward him.
I’ve seen this method work, but with dogs with short legs, I’ve also
seen them pop right back up. They follow the treat all right, but
only their head is down. If your Bully pops up like a jack-in-the-box,
don’t despair, and don’t give him the treat. Keep the treat in your
closed hand on the ground. Your puppy may paw or nibble at your
hand, but don’t give in. Eventually, when all else fails, your puppy
briefly lies down. As he starts to lie down, give the command
Down, and quickly give him the treat.
Teaching the Stay command
Another helpful command is the Stay command. The command Stay
is often the most difficult for a dog to grasp. Young puppies have a
difficult time because their attention spans are short. Puppies dis-
like sitting for any period of time, let alone for long stretches, and
they prefer to be up and playing with you. Understanding your
puppy’s fidgety nature helps you gain more patience for this part of
training. To start the Stay command, follow these simple steps:
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
124

1. Attach the lead to your dog’s collar.
2. Have your Bully sit on your left side.
3. Hold the lead in your right hand.
4. Lean over, and extend your left hand and arm in front of
your dog’s nose, with your palm facing the dog.
5. Give the command Stay.
6. Step in front of your dog.
7. Return to your dog’s side.
8. Praise, and give treats.
Gradually increase both the distance between you and your dog
and the amount of time you stay in front of him. If your dog breaks
his Sit, return to him, and gently replace him in the Sit with no
additional commands.
Don’t rush this process, and always return to his side before you
praise him. Some dogs are wonderful at the Stay until you move;
then they think that they can move as well.
When your dog improves at the Stay on the lead, he can try train-
ing without the lead. If you’re planning to compete in formal obedi-
ence, start returning to your dog on his left instead of his right and
walking around him to get back into position by his right shoulder.
Your dog should maintain his Sit until you release him.
Combining the Down and 
Stay commands
After your dog sits and stays, he can work on Down and Stay.
Follow the same procedure as above, but with your dog on a Down.
Here’s what to do:
1. Attach the lead to your dog’s collar.
2. Have your Bully Down on your left side.
3. Hold the lead in your right hand.
4. Lean over, and extend your left hand and arm in front of
your dog’s nose, with your palm facing the dog.
5. Give the command Stay.
6. Step in front of your dog.
7. Return to your dog’s side.
8. Praise, and give treats.
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 125

Your dog should catch on quickly because the steps are the same,
except that your dog is lying down. The Down and Stay commands
combined can be a magical combination. Here are some of the
benefits:
 A dog who obeys these commands is less likely to be ken-
neled when company arrives or when he may otherwise be
in the way.
 If you’re frantically trying to get Thanksgiving dinner ready
(or any other dinner, for that matter) and on the table, Down
your dog in the corner and tell him to Stay. You can work with-
out worrying about tripping over the dog.
 If you’re bringing in the groceries from the car (and some-
times in the rain), and your Bully is happy to see you, but she
is making you trip, say hello to your pup and then give the
Down and Stay commands. Finish bringing in the groceries.
Make sure to reward her for obeying the command.
 If your dog runs across the road, you may not want to use the
Come command. Having her come to you means that she has
to cross the road again, putting her in danger of getting hit.
But you don’t want her to get even farther away. Give the
Down command, and your well-trained Bully drops to the
ground. Tell her to Stay; then you can cross the road at a safer
time, and snap the lead on your dog’s collar.
In an age of fenced yards and leashed walks, the danger of a
dog’s running out into traffic is less, but accidents happen.
Your dog can slip out an open door, and even your stocky
Bulldog may reach the street before anyone can catch her.
Wait for me!
Wait is another command I like: a smaller, softer form of Stay and
less formal. Wait is a temporary command and doesn’t need a
formal release. Because the command isn’t formal, a particular way
to teach Wait doesn’t exist. Wait means calm down a minute, and
be patient.
Here are a couple of ways to start teaching your Bully the Wait
command:
 If your Bully loses a treat under the table or couch.
My dogs frequently knock dog biscuits under furniture and
can’t reach them. I can, but not with the dogs’ heads between
me and the furniture. If you’re trying to retrieve the dog biscuit
from under the couch, your dog discovers that if he doesn’t
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
126

wait, he doesn’t get the treat. Give him a firm but gentle push
to get him out of the way and say, “Wait.” Retrieve the cookie,
and tell him “Okay.”
 If you’re trying to leave the house.
Use the Wait so your dog doesn’t go through the door with
you. If your dog’s on a lead, say “Wait” as you go through a
door, restraining him so he has to wait for you to go through
the door first.
Some trainers argue that putting your dog on a Sit or a Down–Stay
accomplishes the same goal as Wait. They’re right! But sometimes I
just prefer a less formal command.
Leave It!
Leave It can be a bit harder to teach to a Bulldog, whose instinct
is to hang on forever, but it can be done. Teaching your dog to
Leave It or Drop It is useful when she has something you wish she
didn’t have.
The best way to enforce Leave It is to offer to trade your dog
what’s in her mouth for something she wants more. Use tasty
treats you know that your dog loves. Wait until she has an item in
her mouth, like a toy or a ball. Say “Leave It” or “Drop It,” and show
her the treat. When she spits out the toy to get the treat, praise her
and give her the goody. Repeat this exercise throughout the day,
and she quickly catches on that the command means that she’s
getting a tasty treat.
I can’t live without this command. The Leave It command can save
your sock or shoe from being chewed; and if your dog knows the
Leave It command, when the day comes that your Bully picks up
something dead and disgusting, you won’t have to pry her jaws open;
she willingly gives the carcass up without a fight. Give the command,
and she spits it out by herself. Remember to give her a treat.
One of my females once tried to bring a dead chipmunk into the
house. Fortunately, I saw what it was and gave her the Leave It
command before she made it indoors. She dropped the chipmunk
and then followed me inside for her treat. On a less gruesome note,
I quickly trained my male dog to leave another dog’s stuffed toy in
exchange for a dog biscuit. He was happy, and the toy lasted longer
because he didn’t have a chance to disembowel it.
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 127

Mixing up your training
When your dog understands the Stay command, start mixing up
your training. Go back to his side, and at other times, call him from
the Stay. Use the Down–Stay when you’re working in the kitchen or
when the family is eating. Down is a comfortable position and a
way to teach your dog manners.
Put your dog on a Sit–Stay before walking in- and outdoors and
before he gets fed. Have your Bully sit before someone pets him.
Having your Bulldog work for treats or other rewards is good prac-
tice. This process helps him know that you’re the leader of the pack.
Training your dog can be fun. Incorporate Sit and Down into a
game of hide-and-seek. Put your dog on a Stay, and go into another
room before you call him. Playing games adds fun to the training
and mixes things up. Your Bulldog learns how to stay whether or
not he can see you or whether you’re in a specific room or in a line
with other dogs at an obedience class.
Conquering Common 
Behavior Problems
No dog is perfect, but with training and patience, you can get any
dog close! Don’t despair if your dog bothers people by jumping up,
begging, or barking, but do address the problem. You can teach
your dog to behave. If you don’t have the knowledge or what you
try doesn’t work, don’t give up. Find a professional to help. Just
like you contact a doctor when you’re sick or have a broken bone,
contact a professional dog trainer or behaviorist if you have a
problem with your dog. For more on finding help, see the “Finding
Help” section, later in the chapter.
I beg you: No begging!
Begging is like water torture. The first few drops seem like nothing
at all, but eventually, the water has you screaming. Puppies are so
darn cute that when they look at you with those big, pleading
brown eyes during dinner, you want to give them a tiny bite of your
sandwich. Resist, my friend; resist! Harden your heart — and
resist. What is cute once in a puppy paves the way for continual
daily begging for the life of your dog, and after you start, you can’t
explain to your dog that begging is okay when the family is at the
table but not when a dinner party arrives.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
128

Canines are hard-wired to return to a spot where they receive food.
Researchers discovered that when a wolf caught a rabbit at a spe-
cific spot, he revisited that spot dozens of times in the hope of
catching another rabbit. Similarly, you can create a monster in
your own home. Give your Bully a bit of food from the table once,
and he will return to the scene again and again.
Make a household rule to never, ever feed your dog from the table,
and follow through. If you feel that your dog has to have a sliver of
the Thanksgiving turkey, put the food in his bowl away from the
dinner table.
If you never feed your Bully from the table and he still sits next to
you, staring soulfully into your face, ignore him. If you can’t com-
fortably ignore him, put him at a distance and use that Down–Stay
you practiced, or put him in his crate.
Begging isn’t limited to the table. If you have snacks while you’re
watching television, your Bully wants his share. Sharing a handful
of popcorn is okay, but after you start, your Bully will always be
there, so think about the repercussions of sharing before you do it.
Begging can also develop accidentally. One morning I threw a hand-
ful of Cheerios on the floor, and I enjoyed watching the dogs act like
mini vacuum cleaners. The show was fun, so I threw more Cheerios
on the floor the next morning. By the third morning, I wasn’t even
having cereal, but that didn’t stop the dogs from expecting theirs. A
handful of Cheerios became part of the morning routine.
Moving can break bad habits, but you can’t move every time your
dog starts an annoying habit. We broke the Cheerios habit when we
moved. We were in a strange place, and the dogs had never been
given Cheerios there, so they didn’t expect them. So if your dogs
have some bad habits that you’ve created, and you’re moving in the
near future, be thankful, and think twice this time before you scatter
that handful of cereal or let your dog lick the ice cream bowl.
Jumping isn’t always joyful
Bulldogs aren’t known for being bouncy and jumpy, but in case
your dog is a jumper, think about stopping the habit. Watching
your dog jump for joy when you arrive home may make you feel
happy. But you may not be quite so happy when you’re all dressed
up to go out, and your dog jumps up with muddy paws, ruins your
nylons, or gets tiny white hairs all over your blue slacks. The jump-
ing up doesn’t seem as cute as it once did.
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 129

Even if you never mind your Bulldog jumping up on you, your visi-
tors may not find the habit quite so endearing. Bulldogs are solid,
heavy dogs, and your dog can knock over a child or an older
person and cause injury.
First, make sure that everyone in the family understands that
jumping isn’t allowed. You’re never going to break the habit if half
the family lets your Bully jump; then your corrections and efforts
confuse him. Your dog doesn’t understand why jumping up is all
right sometimes and not always.
Start teaching your Bully not to jump by ignoring him. When you
come home, and he jumps up to greet you, turn sideways to him,
and totally ignore him. Don’t pet him or talk to him or push him off
you. Eventually, he figures out that jumping up isn’t getting him the
attention he wants. When he stops jumping, use the Sit command,
and pet him.
If you’re expecting company, tell your guests ahead of time to
ignore your dog and pet him only when he’s in a Sit position. Pretty
soon your dog realizes that jumping is a totally worthless activity.
After you’ve trained your Bully not to jump, you can train him to
jump up on command. If you’re practicing agility or doing tricks in
the back yard, jumping up can be a fun part of these activities. But
always remember to begin with no jumping as the rule.
Digging up the yard
The good news is that Bulldogs aren’t terriers, who are notorious
for digging. For even more good news, the word on the street is
that Bulldogs aren’t diggers. The bad news is that young dogs may
still dig. Bulldogs may also dig holes to lie in to keep cool. Unless
your Bully is a determined digger, you may want to patiently fill in
the occasional hole and wait for him to mature. Monitor the dig-
ging so your dog isn’t digging up and eating bulbs, many of which
are toxic to dogs.
If you’re simultaneously trying to preserve your lawn and have a
dog, and your particular puppy does enjoy some excavation time,
consider giving your dog his own digging spot. Think of the spot as
a sandbox for dogs. Mark off an area with low boards; add some
sand or dirt; and introduce the spot to your dog. You can make the
introduction by burying dog biscuits just under the sand’s surface
or putting a few drops of bacon grease on “the digging spot.” Before
long, your dog figures out that the box makes a great digging place.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
130

If you don’t want to create a special area, you need to watch your
dog whenever he’s out. If he starts to dig, tell him no and offer a
ball or toy in exchange. Bulldogs don’t generally get too upset with
a verbal reprimand, but know what your own dog can tolerate. My
parents had a dog who was digging up a storm, and they firmly
said, “No digging.” Their tone of voice really upset him, and for the
rest of his life, they had to spell the word “digging,” or he looked
like he had just been scolded.
Keeping the peace: No barking!
Bulldogs aren’t known as barkers. They were never guard dogs or
watchdogs, so barking wasn’t bred into them. But if your Bully is a
barker, his barking can lead to problems with neighbors and com-
plaints that your dog is the noisy one on the block.
Figuring out the distractions
If your Bulldog does bark when you’d rather he didn’t (or the neigh-
bors rather he didn’t), take a look at the reasons for the barking:
 Animals: If your backyard has rabbits, squirrels, or other
furry friends, maybe the distraction of other animals is what
is making your dog bark. Give your dog something to do, and
he’s less apt to bark at activity on either side of your fence.
 Boredom: If your dog is left out in your yard for extended
periods of time, he may be barking because he’s bored. Give
him something to concentrate on, and when he’s finished, he
may take a long nap. Ideally, don’t leave your Bulldog outside
so long that he has to resort to barking to entertain himself.
 People: If he’s barking at people, consider a solid fence. Dogs
aren’t as apt to bark at what they can’t see. If children pass by
your home, make sure that they aren’t teasing your dog
through the fence.
 Separation anxiety: If your dog barks when he’s left alone in
the house, he may have separation anxiety. Leave him with a
Kong, a heavy rubber toy stuffed with peanut butter or
cheese. (For more information on Kongs, see Chapter 5.)
Videotapes of solitary dogs have shown that they’re the most
anxious during the first 10 to 15 minutes of being left alone. If
your dog has an occupier during those minutes, chances are
he’ll be fine the rest of the time.
 Traffic: Your Bully may like to bark at passing traffic. Certain
cars make noises that can make your Bully bark wildly. You
can manage this noise by looking for ways to incorporate
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 131

sound insulation into your house. For example, thick fabric
drapes help reduce noise more than blinds or thin drapes do.
 Weather: Don’t leave your dog outside during weather
extremes. Your Bully may be telling you that he is too hot or
too cold.
Barking in the house
If you leave your Bully inside the house all day, and his bark can
wake the dead, try the following routine to lessen the barking:
1. Go through your normal schedule of getting ready to
leave the house.
2. Go out the door.
3. Count to ten.
4. Go back in you house.
5. Leave again.
6. Gradually extend the amount of time you’re gone.
7. Return if your dog starts barking; otherwise, extend the
time.
This process is time consuming. The procedure may take you days
or even weeks to train your dog not to bark when he’s alone. But
believe me — your neighbors will thank you.
When the doorbell rings, and your dog barks, tell your Bully to
bark just as he starts barking. Then praise him and give him a
treat, or if you’re clicker training, click and treat. Before long, he
expects the treat and may even stop barking before you praise and
give him the treat. Start adding the word “Quiet,” “Stop,” or what-
ever word you’ve chosen as the command to stop barking.
If none of these tips works, and your neighbors still say that your
dog barks incessantly, contact a professional trainer for advice.
Finding Help
Don’t hesitate to get help if you feel that you need it, whether the
problem is minor or major. The sooner you get help, the more likely
the problem can be treated and corrected or kept from escalating
into a bigger problem. Discover the ways in which you can get help
to ensure that your Bulldog is a well-mannered companion.

132

Basic obedience classes are offered in most communities. Local
shelters frequently offer classes. Personally, I find classes a way to
discover new information. A class translates what I’ve read into a
visual display, and because the instructor expects progress each
week, I train regularly.
The earlier you start socializing and training your dog, the better.
Many puppy socialization or kindergarten classes admit puppies
before they’ve received all their shots. To find a class, check veteri-
nary offices, local kennels, or your area humane society. If you
can’t find a class, start the basics at home, and remember that all
training methods require patience and consistency.
Puppy classes
If your Bulldog is generally good, but you need help teaching him
or need a way to socialize him, enrolling in a puppy class may be
the solution. Puppy kindergarten classes aren’t the same as formal
obedience lessons. Puppy classes combine play with socialization.
In class, your puppy realizes how to interact with other dogs and
people. One simple exercise at puppy kindergarten consists of
people sitting on the floor in a circle with the puppy in the middle.
The people take turns calling the puppy and giving him a lot of
pats and praise. The puppy understands to trust people and to let
them willingly touch him.
Day care
If you discover that your Bulldog’s behavior problems relate to
your puppy’s lack of play time, consider doggy day care two or
three times a week. Day-care centers provide supervised play for
your dog and give your puppy something to do when you’re not at
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 133
Clicker training
Clicker training was first used with sea mammals. Handlers used metal clickers to
communicate. You can’t put a collar and lead on a dolphin! The system involves pos-
itive reinforcement and shaping of an animal’s behavior. Every time the animal per-
forms an action approximating what the handler is looking for, the handler clicks
and treats. The animal soon associates the click with getting a goody and offers
behaviors in an attempt to hear that click. The book Dog Training For Dummies con-
tains information on this and other types of training.

home. Day care is another way to socialize your Bully with other
people and animals to alleviate barking and behavioral problems.
Obedience classes
For older dogs, obedience classes help teach the basic commands.
Classes in your area may be at the YWCA or YMCA, at your local
shelter, or at a boarding kennel. Trainers may have their own facili-
ties, or a local kennel club may offer classes. Many boarding ken-
nels know of classes, even if they don’t offer them, or you may find
a class posted on a bulletin board at your veterinarian’s office or at
a pet-supply store.
Professional trainers
If you’re dealing with a specific problem, you may want a profes-
sional trainer to come to your home to work with you. A dog who
barks constantly needs some attention at home instead of in an
obedience class. Professional trainers may be listed in the phone
book, or again, you may find them on a bulletin board. If you have
doggy friends, ask them for recommendations. They may know
someone who specializes in working with individuals.
Doggie Psychology 101: Hiring 
an animal behaviorist
If your dog has a problem that goes deeper than excessive energy or
lack of basic training, call out the big guns. If your dog is aggressive
or overly fearful, you may not be able to overcome the problem
without professional help. First, make sure that your pup doesn’t
have any physical problems. A dog in pain may snap or bite or try to
avoid human contact, and these actions can be confused with
having a behavior problem.
If your trip to see a veterinarian rules out a physical problem, you
need to figure out what is wrong with your Bully. Let me just say
that this behavior is highly unlikely from a Bulldog, but exceptions
do exist. At this stage, help is right around the corner. That help is
in the form of an animal behaviorist.
An animal behaviorist may be compared to a psychologist or psy-
chiatrist for people. A trainer may also be a behaviorist, but just
because someone has been training dogs for 20 years doesn’t
make him a behaviorist. A trainer may be able to help you, but if
you need a behaviorist, talk to your veterinarian and see if she can
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
134

recommend someone. Other dog people in your area may also
have suggestions.
Finding a behaviorist can be tricky because national standards for
certification don’t exist. When you contact a professional, ask for
credentials, and get references. If possible, talk to former clients of
the person you’re considering. You can also get help finding a behav-
iorist (in the unlikely event that your Bulldog’s behavior warrants
this level of professional help) in your area at any of the following
professional associations:
 American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB):
For information on the AVSAB, go to www.avma.org/av.sab.
The AVSAB is a group of veterinarians who share an interest in
understanding, teaching, and treating behavior problems in
animals. The AVSAB is committed to preserving and improv-
ing the human–animal bond wherever it exists. Members
range from those who are casually interested in animal behav-
ior to board-certified specialists.
The AVSAB has two levels of membership. The first level is
open only to veterinarians. The affiliate membership is open
to others who have been approved by the executive. Affiliate
members must have a PhD in animal behavior or a closely
related field and be currently active in research and/or prac-
tice of applied animal behavior.
 International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants
(IAABC): The IAABC is yet another organization you can con-
tact. Its Web site is www.iaabc.org. The IAABC’s goal is 
conveyed in its mission statement: “To assist companion 
animals and educate their humans to interrupt the cycle of
inappropriate punishment, rejection, and euthanasia of ani-
mals with resolvable behavior problems.”
Lynn Hoover, president of IAABC, notes that members have
diverse backgrounds, but all have “the knowledge, skill, and
ethics base” needed to work with both dogs and their families
and to collaborate with the family veterinarian.
 Animal Behavior Society: Visit www.animalbehavior.org,
the site for the Animal Behavior Society. This group is a profes-
sional organization for the study of animal behavior. The soci-
ety recognizes that “animal behaviorists can be educated in a
variety of disciplines, including psychology, biology, zoology,
or animal science. A professional applied animal behaviorist
has demonstrated expertise in the principles of animal behavior,
in the research methods of animal behavior, in the application of
animal behavior, principles to applied behavior problems, and
in the dissemination of knowledge about animal behavior
through teaching and research.”
Chapter 10: Mastering Good Manners and Basic Commands 135

Classifying behaviorists
Before making a decision on a behaviorist, take a look at the profes-
sion requirements and the educational background of the position.
A dog trainer who decides to call herself a behaviorist may have
trained hundreds of dogs, but that doesn’t make her a behaviorist,
any more than the newspaper’s advice columnist is a psychiatrist.
Behaviorists can be certified at two levels: Associate Applied Animal
Behaviorist and Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist.
Associate Applied Animal Behaviorist
An Associate Applied Animal Behaviorist’s education must include
a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in a bio-
logical or behavioral science, with an emphasis in animal behav-
ior. Undergraduate and/or graduate coursework must include 21
semester credits in behavioral-science courses, including six
semester credits in ethnology, animal behavior, and/or compara-
tive psychology, and six semester credits in animal learning, con-
ditioning, and or animal psychology.
The applicant must have a minimum of two years of professional
experience in applied animal behavior and must demonstrate the
ability to perform independently and professionally in applied
animal behavior. The candidate must also include personal evi-
dence of independent studies, data analysis, formulation, and test-
ing of hypotheses and professional writing.
An applicant must also show experience working interactively with
a researcher, research assistant, or an intern. This collaboration
must include working on a particular species with a Certified
Applied Animal Behaviorist prior to working independently with
the species in a clinical animal-behavior setting.
Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist
The Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist category has more rigor-
ous educational and experience requirements than the Associate
Applied Animal Behaviorist category.
A certified Applied Animal Behaviorist must have a doctoral
degree from an accredited college or university in a biological or
behavioral science, with an emphasis in animal behavior. The
degree must include five years of professional experience or a doc-
torate from an accredited college or university in veterinary medi-
cine, plus two years in a university-approved residency in animal
behavior. Three additional years of professional experience in
applied animal behavior are also required. Any of these degrees
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
136

must include the same coursework requirements as the Associate
Applied Animal Behaviorist degree.
The applicant must also demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the
literature, scientific principles, and principles of animal behavior.
Candidates must document original contributions or original inter-
pretations of animal-behavior information and show evidence of
significant experience as a researcher, research assistant, or intern
working interactively with a particular species with a Certified
Applied Animal Behaviorist prior to working independently with
the species in a clinical animal-behavior setting.

Showing and Showing Off
Your Well-Trained Bulldog
In This Chapter
 Becoming a canine good citizen
 Understanding disciplines for fun and for show
 Showing your Bully in conformation
 Performing in obedience, agility, and tracking events
 Spreading the love around: Therapy Bulldogs
You and your Bulldog can enjoy many activities together. This
chapter highlights some events that you can accomplish with
your well-trained pet. Note the word “well-trained.” These fun
activities also mean a lot of work. You need to train your Bulldog to
pass the exercises in the Canine Good Citizen test and in obedi-
ence competition. A conformation dog show may look easy, but
you need to coach your Bulldog for that, too.
Becoming a Canine Good Citizen
The title of Canine Good Citizen (CGC) is one of the easiest titles
that your well-trained Bulldog can earn, and after your Bully passes
the test given by a certified tester, you can proudly put CGC after
her name. This notation tells everyone that your dog is, indeed, a
good citizen. All dogs benefit from training, and earning a CGC
means that your dog has the manners she needs when you have
visitors or when you go somewhere with her. A CGC title may mean
that your dog can stay in a motel room with you because the desk
clerk knows that your dog behaves.

Preparing for the CGC test
Most of the things you need to teach your Bulldog for this test you
can do yourself, but some kennel clubs offer classes just for the
Canine Good Citizen test. You may want to see what’s available in
your area. I find that a class helps me because the instructor
expects a certain amount of progress each week, so I can’t put off
the training.
Preparing your Bulldog for the CGC test also gives you an idea of
whether you want to continue with more formal obedience.
Bulldogs aren’t the easiest dogs to train in obedience, but you and
your Bulldog can do it. Plus the two of you get to spend quality
time together.
Although you can certainly train your Bulldog yourself at home,
joining a class has the advantage of following someone who can
help you with problems and familiarize your Bulldog with other
people and dogs.
If you decide to join a class, take your time finding one that’s right
for you and your Bully. Consider whether you want to use clicker
training. Clicker training uses positive reinforcement through a
clicker and food. When your dog does what you want, you mark
the behavior by clicking and giving a treat. Some trainers use a
combination of food rewards and corrections. See Chapter 10 for
more information on training.
To find out about reputable classes of any sort, ask friends who
have dogs, or contact your local kennel club. Sometimes boarding
kennels, local YMCAs, and local humane societies offer classes. See
whether you can visit a class before you sign up. People train dogs
by using many different methods, and you want to make sure that
you’re comfortable with whatever method your instructor uses.
If an instructor yells at or hits any dog, run — don’t walk — from
the class. Yelling and hitting only confuse the dog and may make a
dog aggressive or fearful. A first-rate instructor knows how to train
without raising her voice or her hand.
Classes usually run eight to ten weeks. After you and your pooch
master the basics, you usually can take an advanced class for com-
peting in obedience trials. If your class instructor doesn’t offer
such a class, she can likely recommend someone who does.

Taking the CGC test
When you’re ready to have your dog tested, you notice that the
American Kennel Club (AKC) wants your dog and you to be good cit-
izens. Before taking the Canine Good Citizen test, you have to sign
the Responsible Dog Owners’ Pledge. This pledge states that you
agree to take care of your dog’s health, safety, exercise, training, and
quality of life. You also agree to be responsible for cleaning up after
your dog in public places and never letting your dog infringe on the
rights of others.
After you sign the pledge, you and your dog are ready for the test.
The CGC test has ten steps; here they are:
 Your dog must allow a friendly stranger to approach. In this
test, the evaluator walks up to you and your dog to greet you,
ignoring your dog. Your dog must show no sign of resentment
or shyness and must not break position or try to go to the
evaluator.
 Your dog must sit quietly and allow the person to pet him.
With your Bully sitting at your side, the evaluator pets him on
the head and body. You can talk to your dog during this exer-
cise. Your dog may either sit or stand, but he must not show
shyness or resentment.
 Your dog must allow someone to groom him. You supply the
brush or comb, and the evaluator runs it lightly over your
dog’s body. The evaluator also examines your dog’s ears and
gently picks up each front foot.
 You must take a walk with your dog on a loose lead. This
test isn’t a formal heeling exercise, so your dog doesn’t need
to be on your left side and doesn’t need to sit when you stop. 
 You must walk your dog through a crowd. You and your Bully
have to walk around and closely pass at least three people.
Your dog may show interest in the strangers but continue to
walk with you without being overly exuberant or shy. Your dog
shouldn’t jump on people in the crowd or strain on the leash.
 You must ask your dog to sit and stay down; then you must
leave your dog and return to him. In this exercise, the evalu-
ator replaces your leash with a 20-foot-long line. You can leave
your dog in a Sit or a Down position for the Stay command,
and you can issue more than one command to Stay.
 You must call your Bully, and he must come when called. You
walk 10 feet from your dog, turn to face him, and then call him.
 Your Bulldog must behave politely around other dogs. You
and another handler, each with your dogs, approach each
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 141

other, stop, shake hands, exchange pleasantries, and continue
on for about 10 feet. The dogs should show no more than
casual interest in each other, and neither dog should go to the
other dog or his or her handler.
 Your dog also tests on how he reacts to distractions. In this
test, two distractions take place. Because many people who
have their dog tested for the CGC are also interested in therapy-
dog work, the distractions are frequently wheelchairs or a
person using crutches or a walker. To test how well your dog
recovers from being startled, the evaluator may throw the
crutches to the ground or knock over the walker.
 You must tie up your dog or hand him to someone to hold,
and go out of sight for three minutes. Your dog can move
about but must not whine, bark, or pull to go after you.
If, at any time during the testing, your dog growls, snaps, bites,
attacks, or attempts to attack a person or another dog, he fails
the test.
When you and your Bulldog become official Canine Good Citizens,
you may want to do more obedience training. The following sec-
tions give you some ideas of more ways to show off and have fun
with your Bulldog.
Exploring Conformation Shows 
for Your Bulldog
Conformation shows originally began as a way to evaluate breed-
ing stock, so judges look at each dog and how closely he conforms
to the official breed standard. (The breed standard describes the
ideal dog; see Chapter 2 for breed standards.) Even if you bought
your Bulldog as a pet, you may think about the fun you can have
showing your dog in the conformation ring.
You’ve probably seen parts of dog shows on television, and if that
looks like fun to you, talk to your breeder and other Bulldog lovers
about your Bully’s potential as a show dog. If people who know the
breed say that your dog isn’t show quality, don’t feel bad; your dog
is still your best buddy, and you can do other activities as a team.
If your dog is show quality, you can enter your dog in shows and
earn points toward a championship.
Show-quality dogs compete for championship points. To earn a
championship from the AKC, your dog has to win 15 points.
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
142

Depending on the number of Bulldogs competing, you earn between
1 and 5 points at any given show. Winning 3, 4, or 5 points is called
winning a major. You need to win at least 2 majors under 2 different
judges as part of your 15 points. If your dog accumulates more than
15 points but still hasn’t won 2 majors, he isn’t a champion.
If you decide to enter your dog in a conformation show, ask your
breeder for help, or find someone in your area to be your mentor.
The breeder or a mentor helps you enter shows and gives you
advice in several areas:
 Deciding what to take with you to shows
 Determining what judges may like your dog
 Filling out entry forms
 Handling your dog in the ring
 Revealing grooming tips, too
 Wearing the appropriate attire
Understanding conformation classes
Conformation shows have six classes, and each class is divided by
sex. Male dogs only compete against other male dogs, and female
dogs compete against only other female dogs. Here are the six
classes:
 The puppy class, which further divides into puppies 6 to 9
months and 9 to 12 months
 Dogs 12 to 18 months
 Novice (open to all dogs who haven’t yet won three blue 
ribbons)
 American Bred for dogs bred in America
 Bred by Exhibitor for dogs bred by the person showing
 Open (for all dogs, regardless of who’s showing them, where
they were born, or how many wins they’ve had)
The winners from each class compete for Winners Dog (the award
for the males) or Winners Bitch (the award for the females). The
Winners Dog and Winners Bitch earn championship points.
The final step — the judging for Best of Breed. The Winners Dog and
Winners Bitch return to the ring with any champions entered, and
from these dogs, the judge selects the Best of Breed.
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 143

Figure 11-1 gives a more graphic representation of how an AKC dog
show, in particular, progresses from classes to Best in Show.
Figure 11-1: The progression of an AKC dog show from breed classes to Best 
in Show.
Dogs who are already champions don’t compete in the regular
classes. They enter the Best of Breed class and compete against
the Winners Dog and Winners Bitch. The Champions don’t earn
any more points, but when dogs are “specialed” (entered after
they’re champions), the goal becomes earning group placings and
Best in Show wins. The more wins, the higher the dog’s standing in
national rankings. A high standing adds prestige to the kennel and
gets more people to want to use the dog at stud, and the breeder
can ask for a higher stud fee. For winning bitches, their puppies
have more value.

If your dog wins Best of Breed, he continues to group judging.
Group judging consists of seven groups: working, sporting, terrier,
toy, nonsporting, hound, and herding. The Bulldog is in the non-
sporting group. Your dog joins all the other breed winners from the
nonsporting group (see Chapter 2). All group winners are then
judged a final time, and one dog wins Best in Show.
Scoring your Bulldog
The point system is part of the official breed standard (see 
Chapter 2) and shows you how a Bulldog scores in the ring. This
point system guides a judge in his evaluation of your dog. Judges
place a heavy emphasis on the head, which counts for 39 points,
and on the body and legs, which add up to another 39 points.
Other parts of the dog deserve attention, but this point schedule
shows how important the head and body are in an ideal Bulldog.
For a complete rundown on how dogs are scored, see the sidebar
“Scale of points.”
Junior Showmanship
If your child wants to show your Bulldog, Junior Showmanship is
designed to give younger handlers a chance to compete.
Junior Showmanship divides into two classes: novice and open.
Junior competitors who haven’t won three first-place awards with
competition components compete in the novice class. Juniors who
have won three first-place awards with competition present com-
pete in the open class. Classes divide further into junior and senior
classes. Junior classes are for boys and girls who are at least 10
years old and under 14 years old on the day of the show. Senior
classes are for boys and girls who are at least 14 years old and
under 18 years old on the day of the show.
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 145
Westminster
Two Bulldogs have won Best in Show at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club
Dog Show. The first Bulldog, Ch. Strathtay Prince Albert, won in 1913 and was the
first nonterrier to win. Ch. Strathtay Prince Albert beat almost 200 other Bulldogs to
win Best of Breed before going on to win his group and, ultimately, Best in Show.
The second Bulldog to achieve this honor was Ch. Kippax Fearnaught in 1955. John
Rendel of the Times called him “a picture of power,” and the judge said he was “the
best Bulldog I’ve ever seen.”

The dog who the junior shows must belong to the junior or to a
member of the immediate family and must be eligible for show in
regular conformation or obedience classes. Bitches in season can’t
be shown.
Showing a dog requires 
more than the dog!
Showing your dog isn’t cheap. Entry fees are around $25, but you
also have to pay for your transportation, meals, and hotel room.
You don’t want to waste your money, so make sure that you and
your dog are ready to show.

Preparing your dog for competition
To ensure that you and your Bully are ready for competition, check
into handling classes, where you discover the correct speed for
your dog as he moves around the ring and how to wear your arm-
band (on the left arm). At class, you study the various patterns a
judge may use as he evaluates your dog. A judge may ask you to
move your dog in a triangle, an L, or a simple Down and Back.
Classroom practice helps alleviate mistakes in the show ring. Most
local kennel clubs offer inexpensive handling classes that usually
range in price from $3 to $10 a session.
Although handling techniques vary a bit among breeds, some meth-
ods are basic. For example, you need to know how to get your
Bulldog to stack — stand solidly — and hold still while the judge
looks him or her over. Also, your dog must allow a stranger — the
judge — to run her hands over him and to open his mouth to check
his bite (although some judges ask the handler to show the bite).
Your dog must trot around the ring with you so that the judge can
observe his gait. Never stand between your dog and the judge.
In conformation, judges examine low-built dogs on a table to make
evaluating them easier. Because Bulldogs can be too big to put on a
table, judges may request a ramp, which raises your dog to a com-
fortable height for the judge. To prepare for this possibility, get
your Bulldog accustomed to walking up a slight incline and stand-
ing quietly on a narrow platform. Most handling classes don’t have
a ramp, so build your own at home.
The more you practice, the more comfortable you and your dog
become in the ring. Before you take the plunge into a real show, try
to attend some matches. Matches run like shows, but they’re
smaller and more informal, and don’t offer any points. Entry fees
run from $5 to $10. A match gives your dog, and you, an idea of
what a show is like and gives you practice — without spending a
lot of money.
Grooming your dog beautiful
Conformation shows are sometimes called beauty pageants. In the
conformation event, judging is based on your dog’s build and how
he moves; however, having him look his best never hurts.
Bulldogs need minimal grooming, but make sure to clean your dog.
Trim his nails, and brush his coat. No judge wants to run her hands
over a dirty dog. Take pride not only in your dog’s structure but
also in his appearance. For details on how to groom your dog prop-
erly, see Chapter 8.
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 147

What to bring to the show
Dog, check. Self, check. But what else do you need to bring with
you to the show? Well, many people take a grooming table and a
box of supplies to a show, but if you groomed your Bully that
morning or the night before, you may not need much more than
your dog and his show lead.
Show leads are typically thin and light so the handler can easily
bunch it up into his hand. The presentation is better than having a
heavier lead dangling from the hand or flapping in the breeze. A thin-
ner collar allows more of your dog’s neck to be seen. The lighter
equipment makes for a cleaner, more elegant look and also implies
training and control because you’re using such light equipment.
Don’t forget the bait — the food tidbits you use to keep your dog
alert in the ring. Also, don’t forget a lot of water for your little guy

Dressing for success
When you dress for a competition, comfort is key. You have a long day ahead of you,
and not wearing the right clothes or shoes makes the day even longer. These few
hints keep you comfy all the livelong day:
 At spring or fall shows, wear layers. A sweater that keeps you comfortable in
the morning may roast you by afternoon.
 Carry a raincoat in your car, no matter what the weatherman says!
 Make sure that you wear comfortable shoes that have nonslip soles. And
remember: High heels are always a mistake!
Now on to the clothing specifics of the events. In conformation, the attire tends to
be more formal. Men typically wear sports coats and ties, and women wear dresses,
although a pantsuit is acceptable. In extremely hot weather, men can shed their
coats, especially if the judge takes off his coat. For women, a pantsuit is accept-
able. No matter what you wear, try to wear a color that contrasts with your dog’s
coat. For instance, if your dog’s coat is red or dark brindle, avoid wearing red, bur-
gundy, or any other color that hides your dog’s color.
In obedience, attire is a bit more casual, but men still frequently wear jackets and
ties. Women prefer wearing slacks and rarely wear skirts or dresses in obedience
events. Unlike conformation competitions, handlers try to match the colors of their
dogs in these events. After all, if the judge can’t see clearly where the dog ends and
your slacks begin, maybe she won’t notice your dog’s crooked Sit!
The agility competition is the most casual event as far as dress goes. In the case of
warm weather, competitors wear shorts. Because your dog works away from you
in agility, matching or contrasting your dog’s coat doesn’t matter.

or gal. I take at least a gallon of water a day. If the weather is hot,
and you attend an outdoor show, take more water, both for wetting
your dog down and for him to drink. Don’t assume that water is
available at the show site.
Take beverages and maybe a picnic lunch for yourself. Food ven-
dors sell concessions at most shows but not always, and the food
generally consists of hot dogs and hamburgers. If you stay at the
show through your dog’s dinner hour, pack his food as well.
In hot weather, you may want to bring ice packs for your dog or a
special coat you can wet down that helps keep him cool. Tuck the
ice packs under a towel, and let your dog lie on them or curl around
them. Any dog can suffer from the heat, but the short-faced Bulldog
is even more susceptible.
Never, ever leave your Bulldog in a closed car, even on an overcast
day. Even on a cloudy day, a car’s interior temperature can soon
climb to a killing temperature. Take your dog with you to get your
armband. If you need a bathroom break, find someone to hold
your dog.
Tackling Obedience Trials
If you and your Bulldog complete a basic obedience class and
enjoy working in obedience, think about trying for the Companion
Dog (CD) title. The CD title is one of several obedience titles based
on progressive levels of training.
Many of the exercises for the CD test are similar to the ones in the
CGC test, though they’re more structured. Each exercise contains
definite patterns; you give only one command and can’t talk to your
dog otherwise. Some of the exercises are performed with your dog
off lead. Although you can train your dog at home, an obedience
class helps if you decide to enter competitions. Additionally, a class
can help your dog get used to the long Sits and Downs in a line with
strange dogs.
Receiving your Companion Dog title
All obedience titles are earned at obedience trials, which are usu-
ally held in conjunction with conformation shows. You fill out your
entry form and include the entry fee, which is around $25.
To earn a CD title, you and your Bulldog need to get qualifying rib-
bons under three different judges. A qualifying score in obedience
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 149

earns 170 out of a possible 200 points, with the dog scoring at least
half the possible points in each exercise. The exercises include
 Heel on lead and figure eight (40 points): During the heeling
exercise, the judge gives you instructions, such as forward,
right or left turn, fast, slow, normal, and halt. You and your
dog must execute each command, with the dog always on
your left in the heel position. For the figure-eight test, two
stewards form “posts” 6 feet apart, and you and your dog
move around them in a figure-eight pattern.
 Stand for examination (30 points): The stand for examination is
just that — you must remove your dog’s lead, leave him stand-
ing, and move away while the judge lightly touches your dog.
 Heel off lead (40 points): In this exercise, you and your dog
execute instructions given by the judge off the lead. These
commands include forward, right or left turn, fast, slow,
normal, and halt. Your dog must always remain on your left
side in the heel position.
 The recall (30 points): On the recall, you put your dog in a Sit,
tell him to Stay, walk about 35 feet away, and turn to face your
dog. When the judge gives you a signal, you call your dog,
who should move eagerly toward you and sit in front of you.
When the judge signals again, you command your dog to Heel,
and he should do so.
 The long Sit (30 points): The long Sit is a group of exercises in
which all the dogs and handlers competing line up in a row.
All handlers put their dogs in a Sit, tell the dogs to Stay, and
then move across the ring and turn to face the dogs. In the
long Sit, your dog must remain seated until you return to him
in one minute.
 The long Down (30 points): The long Down is another group
exercise in which all the dogs go in a Down position. The han-
dlers instruct their dogs to Stay, move across the ring, and
turn to face the dogs. In the long Down, the dog must remain
lying down for three minutes.
Group exercises are a good reason to join a class. A class helps
your dog get used to other dogs, and your instructor may use dis-
tractions to help teach the dogs not to move until given the com-
mand. If your dog can handle classroom distractions, he may be
fine in the ring.

Earning your Companion 
Dog Excellent title
If you and your Bully work well as a team in obedience and have
won the necessary three qualifying ribbons to be awarded a CD,
you may want to work toward the Companion Dog Excellent (CDX)
title. To do so, you need to qualify with three different judges.
If you decide to pursue a CDX, have your veterinarian examine
your dog first. Bulldogs, unlike other breeds, have lax joints, and
unstable joints may lead to jumping injuries.
In CDX competition, your dog performs versions of the exercises
he’s already mastered for the CD title:
 Heel and figure eight off lead (40 points).
 Recall exercise (30 points): At the CDX level, as your dog
moves toward you, he must drop into a Down at your signal.
Then you call your dog again, and he finishes the recall.
 Long Sits (30 points): The long Sit lasts for three minutes, but
this time, you leave the ring — out of sight of your dog. You
have no way of giving your Bully the evil eye if he looks like
he’s going to change position!
 Long Downs (30 points): The long Down lasts for five minutes,
and once again, you leave the ring — out of your dog’s sight.
So far, the CDX exercises extend from the ones you and your dog
have already mastered for the CD title. But now you add a few new
tasks to the list of required exercises:
 Retrieving on the flat (20 points): In this exercise, your dog
waits at your side while you throw a dumbbell and then, at
your command, retrieves the dumbbell.
 Retrieving over a jump (30 points): The AKC regulations state
that the minimum jump height for Bulldogs is “the nearest
multiple of 2 inches to 3⁄4 the height of the dog at the withers.”
The regulations also state that the minimum jump height is 
8 inches. So your Bully probably has a 12-inch jump.
 The broad jump (20 points): This jump is twice as long as the
height of the high jump. If your Bulldog jumps a 12-inch high
jump, he needs to jump 24 inches in the broad jump.
Your Bulldog may not see the point in going over a jump at all.
Many Bulldogs seem to enjoy just going through a jump rather
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 151

than over it, even though the jump is possible, as seen by your
dog’s jump on the couch everyday at home.
Slowly teach your dog to jump consistently. Start your training
with low jumping, getting your Bulldog used to jumping on com-
mand. Keep the jump low until your dog is comfortable, and raise
the height gradually. Pushing your dog can lead to injury and may
make him refuse to jump at all. With the broad jump, start small
and work up to the required width.
Striving for the Utility Dog title
Many handlers and their Bulldogs have gotten the CD title, and
several have gotten the CDX, but not too many have earned the
Utility Dog (UD) title. One reason may be that the tests for this title
involve more jumping, and another reason may be that the title has
a scent test and a retrieve test. In both tests, the dog must pick up
an article and return with it to his handler. A Bulldog can be
trained to retrieve and, even with his short nose, detect your
scent. But many Bulldogs don’t want to give up what they have in
their mouths. Bulldogs were bred to hold on and never let go, no
matter what. A long time has passed since they’ve had to get a
death grip on a bull’s nose, but that instinct to hang on is still
there. Teaching a Bulldog to let go can be a challenge. Still, if you
like challenges, enjoy obedience, and won’t consider any breed
other than a Bulldog, here’s what you and your pooch need to do
to earn a Utility Dog (UD) title:
 Signal exercise (40 points): During the signal exercise, all
commands to your dog are hand signals. As you’re heeling,
the judge issues several commands, including “stand your
dog” and “leave your dog.” When the judge signals to down
your dog, have your dog sit from the down position and then
“come” and “finish,” all by using hand signals.
 Scent discrimination, metal article (30 points), and scent dis-
crimination, leather article (30 points): In this exercise, your
dog has to select the one article out of nine that has your
scent on it. You supply these articles — five metals and five
covered in leather. The articles have a dumbbell shape, and
each has a number.
The judge indicates which article number to use for your scent,
and the remaining articles are placed on the ground. While you
and your dog have your backs to the articles, you place your
scent on either the metal or the leather article — whichever the
judge indicates. The judge takes that article by using tongs or
his clipboard and places it with the other articles on the
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
152

ground. At his signal, you and your dog turn toward the arti-
cles, and you send your dog to retrieve the scented article. You
repeat the process with the remaining article.
 Directed retrieve (30 points): In the directed retrieve, while you
and your dog have your backs to the steward, she drops three
white gloves in a line. Next, you turn to face the row of gloves,
and the judge indicates which glove your dog has to retrieve.
You can purchase sets of three Bulldog-size gloves from ven-
dors at dog shows or order them through catalogs. When I
first got into dogs, I thought that handlers had to buy two
pairs of gloves and throw one away, which seemed a real
shame. I also wondered how anyone knew what size glove to
buy. What a relief when I found out that they came in various
sizes and in sets of three!
 Moving stand and examination (30 points): For this exercise,
your Bulldog heels beside you until the judge gives you the
command to stand your dog. Without stopping, you command
your dog to Stand while you continue to walk ahead another 10
to 12 feet, where you stop and turn to face your dog. The judge
examines your dog; then you call your dog to the heel position.
 Directed jumping (40 points): The exercise has two jumps:
the high jump (a solid jump identical to the one in CDX com-
petitions) and the bar jump (a single bar on two upright
poles). You send your dog away from you, and at the com-
mand to sit, your dog should turn to face you and sit. When
the judge indicates either the high jump or the bar jump, you
direct your dog to do the designated jump. You repeat the
process for the second jump.
Considering even greater Bulldog
obedience challenges
The title of Utility Dog Excellent awards the dogs who receive a
qualifying score in both Open B and Utility B classes at ten separate
competitions. The Open B class exercises are those listed above for
the Companion Dog Excellent title. The Utility B class exercises are
the exercises for the Utility Dog title. As with all obedience titles, a
Bulldog needs a qualifying score of 170 out of a possible 200.
If you and your dog are both happy with obedience, the next chal-
lenge is earning an obedience trial championship, or OTCH. This
competition’s award points are for the number of dogs you defeat
in either Open B or Utility B classes, and you need 100 points to
earn the OTCH. You win points only if you come in first or second
in your class, and under three different judges, you must win a first
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 153

place in Open B over six dogs or more, a first place in Utility B over
three dogs or more, and another first place in either class under
the same conditions.
So far, no Bulldog’s earned an OTCH. Maybe yours will be the first!
Competing in Agility: Yes, 
Bullies Can Do It!
If the structure of obedience doesn’t appeal to you or your Bulldog,
consider agility. In agility events, your dog competes in running
timed obstacle courses. Though they may not seem built for it,
Bulldogs can and do compete in agility.
Three major organizations offer agility competitions:
 The American Kennel Club (AKC)
 The United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA)
 The North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC)
Each organization has its own set of rules and regulations, and
they change periodically. Each organization also has three levels of
competition. The AKC has Novice, Open, and Excellent; the USDAA
has Starters/Novice, Advanced, and Master; and the NADAC has
Novice, Open, and Elite. The AKC also has Jumpers with Weaves
(JWW), a course with no contact obstacles (no dog walk, A-frame,
or teeter-totter). The JWW contains jumps and weave poles and
may have open and/or closed tunnels. Titles in JWW include
Novice, Open, Excellent, and Master Excellent. You can also go on
to win agility championships.
If you worry about dog injuries or stress, you can enter the AKC
preferred class, which includes 12-inch jumps rather than 16-inch
jumps and an added 5 seconds to the time allowed to complete the
course. NADAC also offers a 12-inch jump for Bulldogs. The USDAA
doesn’t offer these jumps, and in fact, if your Bulldog is over 16
inches at the withers, his jump height is 22 inches.
Because agility is a challenging and complex sport, the best advice
is to put in the time at the novice level, making sure that your dog
always touches the yellow contact area of the A-frame, teeter-totter
and dog walk, so that missing that area doesn’t become a problem
at advanced levels. Waiting a bit and not pushing your dog too hard
is a good idea, because you want to give a young dog plenty of time
to finish growing and be in good physical condition. Agility is a
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
154

demanding sport, especially for Bulldogs. Waiting until your dog is
18 months to 2 years old before actually competing is a good idea,
because your dog needs time to get conditioned, to build up stam-
ina, and to mature (Bulldogs take between 2 and 3 years to fully
mature). Your dog must be at least 12 months old before he can
compete in an AKC agility event. To compete in a NADAC or a
USDAA competition, your dog must be at least 18 months old.
An agility course presents different obstacles for your dog to com-
plete in a specific order and in a certain amount of time. The main
obstacles in an agility course are
 A-frame, where the dog goes up one side of the A and down
the other.
 Dog walk, which is a sloping board that leads up to another
level board, which the dog walks across, and then another
sloping board down that leads to the ground.
 Seesaw.
 Four types of jumps:
• Broad jump
• Panel jump, which looks like a wall
• Bar jump
• Tire or window jump
 Pause table, where, at the judge’s direction, you must instruct
your dog to sit or down for the count of five.
 Open tunnel. 
 Closed tunnel, or chute, which consists of an open, rigid entry
area and an expanse of cloth for the exit; the fabric has no
support, so the dog must push through it to exit.
 Weave poles, which is a row of poles through which a dog
“weaves,” going between two poles, coming back through the
next two, and so on. Weave poles aren’t part of an AKC-novice
course.
The A-frame, the dog walk, and the seesaw are all contact 
obstacles — that is, they all have a contact zone where the obstacle
touches the ground and are usually painted yellow. The dog must
touch this area as he gets on and off the obstacle to ensure that the
dog doesn’t injure himself by leaping on or off the obstacle.
Agility competitions can be fun for you both as long as you don’t let
your dog overheat. Many agility events have kiddie wading pools
for cooling off the dogs, but make sure that you still carry plenty of
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 155

water and ice. You also may consider investing in a special jacket
that you soak in water and put on your dog to cool him off.
Do you want to know what to do with the ice? Carry ice to cool
water; wrap ice in a towel, and put it in the crate with your dog;
and offer ice to your dog to chew.
Sniffing Out the Fun in Tracking
Tracking isn’t a competition usually associated with Bulldogs, but
Bulldogs can earn tracking titles. Fewer than ten Bulldogs in the
United States have attained tracking titles. However, a trainer in
the Netherlands trains all her Bulldogs to track and says that they
enjoy it. She says that a Bulldog works only if he likes what he’s
doing, so you have to make training fun, not work. Another road-
block is your Bulldog’s shorter nose, so your dog may never reach
the proficiency needed to do search and rescue. But if tracking
sounds like fun to you, give it a try.
The AKC offers tracking tests and supplies a booklet of the rules
and regulations. Tracking tests, like obedience tests, have entry
fees, and tracking clubs organize the tests. Find someone in your
area who tracks; subscribe to the AKC Gazette for a listing of
events; or go to the AKC Web site, www.akc.org.
Tracking tests a dog’s ability to follow a particular scent. Variable
Surface Tracking (VST) includes pavement as well as other sur-
faces, such as gravel and grass. As with obedience titles, tracking
has various levels of titles. Each level is based on the number of
turns in the trail, the length of the trail, and how long the scent has
aged before the dog starts to track it. (Aging is the amount of time
between when the trail is laid and the dog is allowed to start track-
ing.) To complete any tracking title, two judges must certify that
your dog has successfully completed the track for any given trail.
For all tracking titles, you need a harness and a tracking lead,
which must be between 30 and 40 feet long.
Tracking titles include
 Tracking Dog (TD): For the TD title, a dog follows a track
that’s at least 440 yards long, has 3 to 5 turns, and has been
aged at least 30 minutes and no longer than 2 hours. The track
can’t cross any paved area or body of water and has two start-
ing flags — one at the beginning of the track and one 30 yards
from the first one to indicate the direction in which the track
was laid. The first flag lets you know where your dog picks up
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
156

the scent. The second flag lets you know that you and your
dog are moving in the right direction. At the end of the track is
a glove or wallet, which the dog must indicate in some way.
The dog may pick up the article, may sit or lie down, or other-
wise show that he has found the article.
 Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX): Your dog must have a TD title
before he can compete for a TDX. For the TDX title, your dog
must traverse a track at least 800 yards long, containing 5 to 7
turns, and aged at least 3 hours and no more than 5 hours.
Two cross tracks cross the main track, and two obstacles — a
stream, a fence, a bridge, a lightly traveled road, a gully —
must also be in a TDX track. Along the way, your dog needs to
find four articles.
 Variable Surface Tracking (VST): VST tracking tests your
dog’s ability to track over changing surfaces. A dog must
already have a TD or a TDX title to compete for a VST title. In
this test, the trail crosses three different surfaces, with one
being vegetation and the other two a combination of concrete,
asphalt, gravel, sand, hardpan, or mulch.
 Champion Tracker (CT): A dog gets the Champion Tracker
title (CT) when he earns all three tracking titles.
Rallying Around!
Rally is a new sport based on obedience commands, but Rally is less
structured than obedience trials. Handlers can talk to their dogs, pat
their legs, and otherwise encourage their dogs without penalty. You
can’t touch your dog, but you can use hand signals. The dog walks
on the left, but perfect “heel position” isn’t required. Each dog-and-
handler team’s time is recorded in case the points end in a tie.
In obedience, a judge gives the commands, but in Rally, signs
(between 10 and 20) direct you. After the judge gives the command
“Forward,” you’re on your own to complete the exercises. Judges
allow handlers a 15-minute walk-through of the course without their
dogs so they know which commands the course includes.
Bulldogs compete at three levels of competition: Rally Novice,
Rally Advanced, and Rally Excellent:
 In the Rally Novice class, the dog remains on lead at all times,
and the team completes between 10 and 15 stations.
 In the Rally Advanced class, all exercises are judged off lead,
and exercises contain between 12 and 17 stations, including
at least 1 jump. The jumps are the same as those used in
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 157

obedience, broad, high and bar jumps. Dogs less than 15 inches
at the withers jump 8 inches; dogs measuring between 15 and
20 inches jump 12 inches; and dogs measuring over 20 inches
jump 16 inches.
 In the Rally Excellent class, again, the dogs are off lead, except
for the “honor” exercise. During the honor exercise, one dog
either sits or Downs at the judge’s direction and remains in
that position while another dog-and-handler team completes
the course.
The course consists of 15 to 20 stations and at least 2 jumps. A
handler at the Rally Excellent level may not clap or pat his leg to
encourage his dog, but multiple commands are still permitted.
A minimum score of 70 points, out of a possible 100, qualifies. A
team may lose 3 to 10 points, or even receive a nonqualifying
score, for handler error. The total deduction depends on the fre-
quency and severity of the error.
A one-point deduction occurs for each of the following:
 Being out of position
 Delaying or resisting responding
 Having a tight lead
 Interfering (on the dog’s part) with the handler’s forward
motion 
 Sitting poorly
 Touching a jump, pylon, post, or person
In the case of the following incidents, a three-point deduction occurs:
 Barking excessively
 Giving a loud command or intimidating signal
 Knocking over a post or pylon
 Lacking control
 Repeating a station
A 10-point deduction is taken for
 Hitting a jump
 Performing a station incorrectly
Part II: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
158

A judge may also deduct one to ten points for lack of teamwork.
Nonqualifying (NQ) scores include
 Being substantially out of position/not completing the honor
exercise
 Eliminating in the ring during judging
 Failing to attempt a station
 Failing to meet minimum requirements
 Having an unmanageable dog
 Knocking off the bar from the uprights and/or using a jump as
an aid in going over
 Maintaining a consistently tight lead
Working with Your Bulldog 
as a Therapy Dog
If you refer to your Bully as a couch potato, and you aren’t compet-
itive enough to enjoy any formal events, consider having your dog
become a therapy dog. Therapy dogs visit healthcare facilities. A
dog may do as little as sit and be petted, or a dog may be actively
involved in patient care. Throwing a toy for a dog to retrieve can
be part of physical therapy. A therapy dog may also visit schools.
Children love to read to dogs, and dogs love to be read to, and they
never care if a child makes a mistake. Therapy dogs also visit sur-
vivors after a disaster. The dog doesn’t find victims but offers com-
fort to the victims and to the rescue workers as well. Disasters add
stress to life, and the presence of a calm, loving dog can help
people cope. Bulldogs make great therapy dogs because they’re
calm and because they love people.
Therapy dogs and their handlers traditionally visit nursing homes
and hospitals, but your dog may be the perfect canine for a visit to
the local school. Most Bulldogs are calm and steady with children.
If you don’t have children of your own, make sure that children
don’t frighten your dog. Many schools have programs where chil-
dren can read to a dog. The reading program gives the child prac-
tice and supplies a listener who doesn’t criticize them.
Although you can make nursing home, hospital, and school visits
with a “regular” dog, some organizations, like Therapy Dogs
International and the Delta Society, register therapy dogs. For more
information, check out their Web sites: Delta Society,
Chapter 11: Showing and Showing Off Your Well-Trained Bulldog 159

www.deltasociety.org, and Therapy Dogs International, www.
tdi-dog.org.
To become a registered therapy dog, your Bully has to pass a test
similar to the Canine Good Citizen test. The test includes exercises
with a person using a wheelchair, crutches, a walker, or all three.
If one of these organizations certifies your dog, he gets a special ID
tag for his collar, and you may get a laminated wallet card to show
as proof of his certification. The agency also may provide insur-
ance coverage for visits in case your dog accidentally harms some-
one and may offer guidelines for taking your dog to hospitals or
other healthcare facilities.
One drawback to having Bulldogs as therapy dogs is that people in
wheelchairs or beds can have a difficult time reaching them. Plus
Bulldogs’ weight makes putting them in someone’s lap nearly
impossible. So that your Bully can provide a little TLC, consider
teaching him to put his front paws up on the side of a wheelchair
or bed, but always check with the facility manager first for permis-
sion to do so.
Whether your dog is registered with an agency or not, take proof of
vaccinations with you when you make your visit. You may not need
the proof, but sometimes administrators want to make sure that
your dog has his necessary shots, especially rabies. Make sure that
you’ve cleaned your dog and trimmed his nails. Trimming your dog’s
nails is important: Remember, older people have delicate skin, and
your pooch’s nails can easily bruise or tear their skin. Make sure
that your dog is clean; no one wants to pet or smell a dirty dog!

On the Go: Taking, Leaving, 
or Looking for Bully
In This Chapter
 Exploring your traveling means 
 Packing the vacation bags
 Leaving Bully at home
 Knowing what to do if you lose your Bulldog
You want your Bulldog with you, but you need to know the best
way to travel with him. Don’t worry — I give you the overview
on transporting your Bully, packing for him, and finding great desti-
nations he’ll love accompanying you to. I also tell you what to do
when you have to leave your Bully behind. And this chapter con-
tains tips on what to do if the unthinkable happens and your
Bulldog gets lost.
Investigating Your Travel Options
Many methods of transportation exist to move us from point A to
point B. How you decide to reach your vacation destination is up
to you. The most popular methods of travel are probably by car or
plane. But whatever you decide, consider your Bulldog’s comfort
when making plans.
Traveling by car
If your Bulldog isn’t used to riding in a car, now’s the time to accus-
tom him to it. Some dogs equate riding in a car with going to the
veterinarian’s office. They resist getting into the car, and they’re
not happy after they get in. They may whine, bark, or even throw
up. It’s hard to blame them. I wouldn’t be happy about a car ride,
either, if the trip always ended at the doctor’s office.

If your car has leather seats, place an antiskid mat underneath a
blanket to prevent your Bully from sliding around when you slam
on the breaks or accelerate. Sudden movement and slipping can
injure your Bully.
When your Bully’s in the car, either put him in the crate or attach
the harness. Whatever means of restraint you use, offering more
treats aids in the process. To get your Bulldog used to riding in the
car, try these steps:
1. Start slowly, and be patient.
2. Open the doors on each side of the car.
3. Coax your Bully in the car with food and then out the
other side.
4. Don’t try to restrain him or keep him in the car.
5. When he’s willingly going through the car, shut the door
on one side.
6. Invite him in with food and then let him out again.
7. If he’s happy to stay in the car for a bit — great — but
don’t shut the door yet.
After your Bulldog is happy hanging out in the car for a while, take
a car ride or two, but make the trips short. Follow these easy steps
to ease your Bully into taking those car trips:
1. Take your dog for a short drive around the block.
2. Give your Bully a treat, and let him out of the car.
3. Gradually increase your drive time.
4. Drive your dog to a park and then go for a walk.
5. Drive up to a bank drive-through window where dog bis-
cuits are given.
If you take your Bully places that are fun and where your pup gets
treats, eventually, your Bulldog will understand that not all trips
lead to the veterinarian’s office.
Remember, you absolutely, positively can’t leave your dog in a
closed car while you go sightseeing. Even with the windows down,
a car in the summer can get dangerously warm for a Bulldog. If
you’re planning on crating your dog, the crate will get even hotter
while you’re away having fun. Parking in the shade is no guarantee
of coolness either, because shade moves, and your car may soon
be in the sun.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
162

Using a crate
If your dog is crate trained, have him ride in a crate in the car (if
you have a big-enough car). Your Bully is safer and more comfort-
able in his crate. Many times, crates have water or food dishes
attached, so your Bully can have a refreshing snack on your trip.
Also, your dog’s crate likely has his scent on it; this scent can
lessen the frightening factor of the car and make your dog more
willing to take a trip. Depending on the type of interior you have 
in your vehicle, your Bully’s mess may be easier to clean if he’s
confined to a crate. If he gets sick, urinates, or defecates, these
messes will be limited to a small crate instead of in your back seat.
Using a harness
If you haven’t crate trained your Bully, or if you drive a compact
car, consider investing in a seat harness — you don’t want your
Bully flying through the air or escaping from the car into traffic if
you have a car accident.
Airbags are as dangerous to a dog as they are to a small child.
Don’t let your dog ride in the front seat, even with a harness.
Securely fasten your Bully in the back seat.
Traveling in the air
If you’re flying to your vacation destination and still want your
Bully to go with you, plan ahead. Think about where you’re going
and what the weather is like. Most airlines fly dogs only if the desti-
nation’s temperature is under 85 or over 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
All airlines are different, and the rules change frequently, so make
sure that you get all the information you need well before your
planned flight. Besides the limits based on temperature, some air-
lines have a limit as to how many dogs they accept on a particular
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 163
Sightseeing with your Bully
Part of the fun of a car trip can be stopping to visit roadside attractions, but sight-
seeing can be harder if you brought the dog along. If you take your Bully along, plan
your trip to include dog-friendly sights as well.
If you absolutely can’t leave your dog at home, some theme parks and attractions
have kennel facilities. You can enjoy the park, and your dog can stay safe and cool.

flight. In addition, many airlines have different rules for Bulldogs
than for other breeds. Make sure that you specify that your dog is
a Bully.
Bulldogs can become dangerously stressed during air travel. Have
your veterinarian rule out elongated soft palate, stenotic nares,
and small-trachea problems before you schedule a flight. Dogs with
restricted airways should not fly. (For more on these issues, see
Chapter 14.)
Riding in cargo
People with smaller pets have the option of taking the dog in the
cabin with them, but unless you’re traveling with a Bulldog puppy,
your Bully’s crate isn’t going to fit under the seat, and he won’t be
allowed to fly in the cabin. Plan your route carefully. Plane trans-
fers are harder on your dog, and a chance exists that she can get
lost en route.
An overnight flight (red-eye flight) lessens the risk of overheating
and may also be less chaotic.
If you decide to fly with your dog, you need to abide by a few rules
to ensure your Bully’s safety:
 House your Bully in an airline-approved crate. Plastic
models are better than metal because metal tends to absorb
more heat; remember that heat is especially dangerous for a
Bulldog.
 Tape a label on the crate that lists your destination, name,
address, telephone number, and dog’s name. You may also
want to include your veterinarian’s phone number. If you have
a cell phone, be sure to include that number on the label.
 Place absorbent bedding in your Bully’s crate. Shredded
paper under fleece is a good choice because fleece is comfort-
able for your Bully, and liquid that your dog expels runs
through the fleece and is absorbed by the paper shreds.
 Don’t feed your dog for at least 12 hours before the flight.
A little urine is easier to clean up than feces.
 To keep your Bully cool, freeze water in your dog’s water
dish, and place the dish in the crate. Your dog can either lick
the ice or drink the water as the ice melts. Frozen water pre-
vents spilling and keeps your Bully cool on the flight.
 Don’t tranquilize your dog before a flight. If your dog gets hot,
he may be too woozy to compensate for the heat by panting.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
164

 Run a bungee cord over the door of the crate to keep the
door from opening if the crate is dropped or bumped.
Luggage shifts, and items fall over. You don’t want your Bully
wandering around the cargo section of the plane while the
plane is in flight. 
Dropping off and picking up your passenger
Make sure that you understand exactly how and when your dog 
is loaded on the plane, and where and when you can pick her up
when the flight lands. Be polite, but be persistent. If you don’t 
actually see your dog board the plane, ask the gate counter agent
to call the ramp to make sure that your dog is on board.
Pick up your Bulldog promptly at your destination. If you don’t get
your dog in a reasonable amount of time, ask about the delay. Ask
again. Ask before your plane has taken off. Having your dog with
you is the point of the trip, not having him fly to another city with-
out you.
Packing for Your Pooch
Packing your Bully’s bag for your vacation is just as important as
packing your own bags. The first item in your dog’s travel bag
should be his shot record. If you’re crossing state lines, leaving the
country, or staying in a state or federal park, you may be required
to show proof of your dog’s vaccinations, particularly the date of
his most recent rabies shot. Here is a list of items you should have
with you when traveling with your Bulldog:
 Medication: If your Bulldog is on any kind of medication, take
enough for the trip. If you plan to be away during the time for
your Bully’s monthly heartworm medicine, don’t forget to take
that medication too.
Even if your own home is flea and tick free, the place that you
are going may not be. Ask your veterinarian for a preventive
flea medication.
 Food and water: Think about the long the trip, and take food
and water for your pal (and for yourself too, if you want). 
• Make sure to pack your dog’s regular food. Don’t take
the chance that your dog’s brand of kibble isn’t available
everywhere. Carry enough food for the entire trip.
• Carry a food dish and a water dish. This will make
Bully feel more at home.
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 165

• Bring water from home. This prevents doggy tummy
upsets from unfamiliar water. If your trip is so long that
carrying enough water is impractical, mix water from
home with water on your travels so your dog gets used
to changes gradually.
• If you’re traveling in the summer, bring a cooler with
ice to help keep your Bully cool and happy. Freeze
plastic jugs of water to have both ice and water as the
ice melts.
 Toys: Pack your dog’s favorite toy. Travel is stressful. Making
sure that your Bully has his teddy bear each night helps him
adjust.
 Towels: Take extra towels. Dogs always find the patch of mud
or the puddle in the parking lot. Take more towels than you
think you need.
 First-aid kit: Take a small first-aid kit. Pack a few basics like
disinfectant, gauze pads, and antibiotic cream. Make sure that
you pack an extra blanket in the car. For information on first-
aid kits, see Chapter 15.
Bulldog-Friendly Places to Stay
If you already have a destination in mind, you still need to know
how to find a good place to stay. Whether you’re looking to camp
or stay in a hotel, the following sections give you some good tips
for making the experience a good one for all involved.
Finding a pet-friendly motel
If you’re going to take your dog with you on vacation, you have to
plan ahead. Although many motels happily welcome dogs, many
more don’t. Make your reservations well in advance, and make
sure that your dog will be an accepted guest at the hotel where
you want to stay. After a long day of driving, you don’t want to be
turned away from your motel.
The AAA publishes a guide called Traveling with your Pet, which
lists thousands of pet-friendly places to stay. But if your favorite
resting place isn’t in the book, give it a call and find out what the
policy is regarding pets. If you’re camping, check with camp-
grounds about their policies too.
Sometimes, smaller places that aren’t part of a chain allow a dog if
he’s crated or has had obedience training. Find out the policies of
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
166

the hotels in the area you are staying. Never be afraid to ask. What
can it hurt?
Many motels and hotels charge a fee for a dog. Find out about the
fees ahead of time so the extra money isn’t a shock.
Protecting your pooch in the room
Crating your dog while he’s in a motel room alone is a good idea.
Even the best-trained dog may be anxious in a strange place, and
sometimes anxiety can mean a chewed chair leg or a puddle on the
carpet. Also, when your dog is safe in his crate, he can’t acciden-
tally escape if the room door is opened. A crated dog means that
housekeeping can enter safely, too. Your dog may be the biggest
lover in the world, but a stranger doesn’t know that. 
If you’re leaving your dog in the room while you go sightseeing or
out to eat, turn on the television or radio. The noise helps calm
your dog and masks outside distractions that may make your dog
bark.
Cleaning your room yourself
When you stay at a hotel, you may expect your room to be clean
and tidy when you return from a day of fun in the sun. To make
your stay happy for everyone involved — you, your dog, house-
keeping, and the management — you may want to consider clean-
ing your room yourself.
Try these tips to keep the peace:
 Put out the “Do not disturb” sign.
 Make your bed yourself.
 Travel with a sheet so you can cover the bedspread. Dog hair
on a bedspread is hard to remove, and believe it or not, hotel
bedspreads aren’t washed between guests.
If you don’t want to carry a sheet, ask housekeeping for one.
They’d rather launder an extra sheet than have to clean the
bedspread. The sheet also keeps the spread clean if your
Bully’s paws are a bit dirty.
 Bring your own towels. If your Bully gets dirty or muddy, use
the towels you packed. Don’t use the hotel’s towels.
If you’re staying more than a night or two and need clean
towels for yourself, talk to the front-desk staff. You can proba-
bly arrange to leave the hotel’s dirty towels in the corridor
and have clean ones dropped off.
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 167

 Stay at a place where the room door opens to an indoor corri-
dor instead of directly outside. If your dog gets out the door,
he’s still in the building.
 Keep a piece of plastic under your dog’s food and water
dishes to prevent carpet stains.
If you’re staying anywhere more than a night or two, leave a tip for
housekeeping on the first day. Tipping makes the staff more recep-
tive to working around your dog.
Camping with your Bulldog
A wonderful way to combine a vacation and your love of dogs is 
to go to a dog camp with your Bully. The number of dog camps is
growing, so a camp may be within driving range of where you live.
Dog camps generally offer dorm-style accommodations, and activi-
ties are doggy-based. Camps differ but may offer classes on obedi-
ence, agility, herding, animal massage, first aid, and nature walks.
Some may have a pond or lake for swimming. You can participate
in events like a costume parade or bobbing for hot dogs. Craft
classes may give you a chance to make a dog collar or lead for
your Bully.
Whatever is offered, the atmosphere at camp is dog friendly and
leisurely, and human food is generally excellent and one of the
attractions — no charred hot dogs around the campfire (although
a campfire may happen one night). The dog camp I attended had
hearty breakfasts of pancakes, bacon, sausage, and eggs, and
lunches and dinners were superb. Dogs, much to their regret, keep
to their regular kibble.
More Great Vacation Spots 
for You and Bully
Besides dog-friendly camps and hotels (see the previous section),
a fun getaway for Bulldogs is anyplace with water. Bulldogs love
water, but unfortunately, most of the breed swim like a rock. In
addition, Bulldogs’ upturned noses make drowning a real danger.
With those warnings out of the way, a vacation on the shores of a
small lake or near the ocean may be just the getaway you’re look-
ing for. Your Bully loves walks along the shore, cooling his tootsies
in the waves or wading a bit. Keep your dog on a lead so you can
keep him out of deep water.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
168

Don’t let your Bulldog drink salt water. Salt water causes your dog
to be violently ill. Let your Bully play in the ocean, but don’t let
him drink the water.
Dog-friendly bed-and-breakfasts make a relaxing getaway and gen-
erally offer more freedom for your dog, as well as more lawn area.
If you travel a lot or want to go only where your dog is welcome,
check out Doggone — “The newsletter about fun places to go and
cool things to do with your dog.” This publication prints six times
a year and lists a variety of places you can visit with your Bully.

fun.com, or call 888-DOGTRAVEL.
Leaving Your Bully Behind
Sometimes, taking your Bulldog on your vacation just isn’t practi-
cal. A trip through the Southwest in July is definitely not Bulldog
friendly. A trip to Europe is probably better without the added
worry of your dog. And sometimes, even on a short trip, you want
to stay out late, sleep in, and spend hours touring the area without
thinking about feeding or walking your dog or worrying about his
comfort.
Whether you’re boarding your dog or hiring a pet sitter, leave the
number for your veterinarian, as well as a contact for long-term
care should something happen to you. And tell your veterinarian
about the arrangements. See whether the office will bill you if
either the kennel owner or the sitter takes your dog in for treat-
ment. Planning ensures that your dog gets the care he needs, and
questions about fees and payments won’t arise.
Boarding your Bully
A boarding kennel can make your vacation not only dog free but
also worry free. Just like your dog’s crate isn’t a jail cell, a boarding
kennel isn’t a jail. Think of a kennel as summer camp. Sure, you
may see wires and locked doors, but those cages mean that your
dog isn’t wandering loose and getting into trouble. 
You need to check out kennels to make sure they’re up to your
standards and will take great care of your beloved Bully. Here are
some tips:
 Visit the kennel without your dog. Look at the fencing. 
The fence should be in good repair, with no holes or pieces 
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 169

of protruding wire. I prefer a kennel where the lower half of
each pen is solid for more separation, but I wouldn’t rule out a
kennel with chain link to the floor if I liked everything else
about the place.
 Make sure that all the dogs have fresh water available and
clean food bowls. The place should be clean. A kennel may
smell a bit doggy but not like urine or feces. The pens should
be picked up and the outside play area clean.
After you have toured the facilities, ask some questions about what
you saw and what you expect from the kennel:
 What’s the playtime policy? Some kennels put dog-friendly
dogs together for a bit of playtime. Ask what criteria staff
members use to determine how the dogs get along. If you
don’t want your dog to be part of a playgroup, say so.
 What kind of food do you serve? Most kennels feed quality
food that agrees with most of the dogs they board. If your dog
is on a special diet, or you don’t want his food changed, ask
about supplying your own food. An extra charge may be
assessed. Kennel owners are happy to meet the needs of their
clients, but remember that you may have to pay for the duties
that take more time or if you need storage space.
 Will you be able to give my Bully her medication? If your
dog is on medication, let the kennel operator know. If your
dog has any condition that needs watching, tell the manager.
Write out any special instructions, and give the kennel staff
more information rather than less.
Leave your veterinarian’s number in the case of an emergency.
 What is the kennel policy if a veterinarian is unavailable?
What’s the kennel’s backup plan? When I leave a dog at a
kennel, I always state that I want any problem treated aggres-
sively. I’d rather pay for a trip to the veterinarian that was
unnecessary than have something happen to my dog because
I told the kennel operators to “wait and see.”
 Can I bring in bedding and toys for my dog? Most kennels
let you supply these items for your dog. I suggest washable
towels. Some dogs get nervous in a kennel, and they demon-
strate their anxiety by chewing on their bedding. I’ve seen
expensive wicker beds turned into matchsticks. Save the
plush foam bed for home, and send towels to the kennel.
 What are your hours of operation? Be clear on the charges
and on the hours for dropping off and picking up your
Bulldog. Some kennels offer pickup and delivery service, so
ask about that if you’re interested.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
170

 Does your staff prefer one breed over another? Make sure
that the staff likes Bulldogs. Some people may dislike or fear
certain breeds. Make sure that the staff understands what a
Bulldog needs and is willing to accommodate those needs.
To make the boarding-kennel stay a bit easier on everyone, try out
these simple tips:
 Ease your dog in by boarding her overnight or just for a
weekend. A “trial run” gives your dog a chance to experience
the kennel and the people who are in charge, yet she’s home
again fairly soon. The younger the dog, the more easily she
adapts to the kennel environment, so whether you’re planning
a vacation anytime soon, think about boarding your dog.
Waiting until your Bulldog is older makes the boarding experi-
ence more traumatic for her (and maybe for you too!).
 Supply a record of your dog’s vaccinations. Some kennels
also require a bordatella, or “kennel cough,” injection before
you can leave your dog for boarding. There are over 100
strains of kennel cough (infectious tracheobronchitis), but the
ones most commonly seen are caused by an airborne virus
that can spread rapidly in a kennel environment. Dogs with
kennel cough develop a dry, rasping cough that lasts about 2
weeks. The disease isn’t life threatening in a healthy dog, but
there is a risk of secondary infection, like pneumonia, which is
minimized by a course of antibiotics.
Hiring a pet sitter
An alternative to a boarding kennel is a pet sitter. With a pet sitter,
your dog stays in her own home, and the sitter comes at specified
times to feed, walk, and play with your Bully. Some sitters even
spend the night at your home. The sitter’s presence in and out
makes your home look lived in, and many times a pet sitter also
brings in the mail and waters your plants.
Choosing a pet-sitting business
Organizations, such as Pet Sitters International and the National
Association of Professional Pet Sitters provide reputable sitters,
but you can find sitters who don’t belong to these organizations.
The key is to find a reputable pet sitter. Don’t think that everything
will be fine because the neighbor’s teenage daughter has volun-
teered to look after your dog. That method may be a cheap way
out, but remember, you get what you pay for.
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 171

If you choose a pet-sitting business, the business should be
bonded and carry insurance. Levels of service are based on how
many times you need a sitter to visit your home and the needs of
the dog/owner. A diabetic dog who needs insulin shots and six
walks a day costs more to pet-sit than a young, healthy dog who
goes out only three times a day.
Calling on Bully lovers
If you don’t trust the neighborhood teenager, and the professional
pet sitter is too expensive, an in-between pet sitter may be right up
your alley (and budget).This sitter is usually a pet lover who has
found sitting an enjoyable way to make some extra money. 
Avoiding stranger anxiety
No matter who you select for pet sitting, the person should visit
your home once or twice before you leave for vacation. Ideally, the
sitter should also visit when you’re still in town but not at home.
Dogs react differently when you let someone into the house versus
when someone comes in and you’re not home. Make sure that your
Bully recognizes the sitter as a friend.
Alleviating misunderstandings
The pet sitter should also know what the rules are. Put instructions
in writing to prevent misunderstandings. If your dog is allowed on
the couch, fine. If not, let the sitter know. If you limit treats for your
Bully, tell the sitter. Give the sitter whatever information helps her
give your dog the best care. If you never walk on a certain street
because of a loose dog, let her know.
Knowing What to Do If 
You Lose Your Bulldog
Whether you’re on a trip or at home, be prepared for the worst and
have an action plan in case your Bulldog goes missing. In the event
that your dog gets lost, he should always have proper identifica-
tion. But no matter what methods you use for identification, if your
dog should become lost, don’t rely on tags, tattoos, or microchips
alone to get your dog back. You need to make an effort to track him
down.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
172

Identifying Bully 
If your Bully gets lost, his identification is all he has to link him
back to you. I recommend that everyone have her pet both tagged
and microchipped. Why two methods of ID? Well, if your Bully ends
up a mile from your home, your neighbor can bring him right home
or give you a call. On the other hand, tags can come off collars, and
collars themselves may come off your dog. If your dog ends up in 
a shelter, and he’s microchipped, he can be scanned and returned
to you.
Taking tags into consideration
Tags are an easily visible means of identification. You have your
Bully’s rabies and license tags, so why not add one with your name
and contact information?
Tags come in many different styles, even ones that glow in the
dark. Most pet stores can order tags for you, and some even carry
vending machines that allow you to custom-make dog tags on the
spot. Most identification tags minimally list your phone number
and may also include your address and/or your name. Many pet
owners also put their dog’s name on the tag.
Some people discourage identifying your pet by name; stealing
your dog becomes easier because thieves can call your dog by
name. You make the judgment call. If a thief is close enough to 
your dog to read her tag, he is also close enough to snap on a 
lead or pick up your dog, and he doesn’t need to call her.
If you’re traveling with your dog a long way from home for your
vacation, make up an additional ID tag for your dog to wear, with
your vacation address and phone number. 
Here are some tips for making sure the information on your tag is
as useful as it can be:
 Cylinder tags hold a piece of paper with your information and
are handy if you move around a lot or travel with your dog,
because you can change the information to reflect your local
address.
 If your dog is staying home, make another tag with a local 
contact — the pet sitter or a friend who can pick up your 
dog if he is found.
 Include your cell-phone number on your dog’s tag. Typically,
with today’s technologies, cell-phone numbers rarely change
because they’re used in all parts of the country. Listing a 
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 173

cell-phone number ensures the best possible contact number
in the event that your dog becomes lost.
 Many people also put the word reward on the dog tag. The
idea is that the finder may be more inclined to call the owner
than to keep the dog or dump him at the pound. Be aware that
just because someone calls saying he has your dog doesn’t
mean that he does. Money should never change hands until
the dog is returned. If you suspect fraud or that your dog is
being ransomed, contact local law enforcement.
Microchipping your dog
One of the most effective ways to identify your dog is with a
microchip, which costs about $45. Microchips never fade or
stretch, like tattoos, and can’t fall off, like a tag. 
The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice; the vet inserts the
device just under the skin between your dog’s shoulder blades.
Special scanners can read the chip’s information, which includes the
registered agency and your dog’s individual number. A veterinarian
or shelter worker calls the agency for your contact information.
Although different companies supply microchips, most veterinari-
ans and animal shelters have scanners that can read the information
on all chips. Ask your veterinarian about the microchip on your first
visit. Tips on locating a good veterinarian are in Chapter 13. 
Microchips have the advantage of being permanent. They can’t get
lost or become unreadable. The disadvantage is that a scanner is
needed to detect and read the chip, and many people don’t know
about microchips. Although most veterinarians’ offices and animal
hospitals and shelters have scanners that can read the chips from
the three major chip systems, the scanners are no use unless your
lost dog is brought to one of these places to be scanned.
The paperwork that comes with a microchip includes contact
sources in the case that your information changes. A fax number,
e-mail address, and regular mailing address are included. If your
contact information changes, use one of those methods to keep
your info up to date. If your Bully is lost, you want your current
location on file with the registering agency.
Tattooing your Bully
Many breeders tattoo their dogs, so your Bulldog may come to you
with a tattoo. Before the rise of identity theft, many people used
their Social Security number as the identifying tattoo. Now the
number is usually your dog’s registration number or a randomly
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
174

chosen number (usually chosen by your breeder) that is stamped
on all of your Bully’s information.
A tattoo can prevent dog thieves from selling your dog to a
research laboratory but may not help if your dog is lost in the
neighborhood. The idea behind tattooing is that someone picks up
your dog; recognizes the tattoo; and takes your puppy to a shelter,
vet, or breeder who can research the number and return your dog
to you.
Keep in mind that most people don’t know to look for a tattoo as
an identifier when it comes to dogs. Also, tattoos can fade and
stretch as your puppy grows. Only one of my dogs came with a
tattoo, and that dog’s veterinarian records reflected the number
tattoo; but as she’s grown, the tattoo has stretched and faded. So
this method may not be the most reliable way to identify your dog.
Looking for a lost Bulldog
Be aggressive. Do everything you can to let people know that your
dog is lost and that you are the owner. Make up posters of your
dog. If you have a scanner, a printer, and a computer, you can make
your own posters, complete with a picture. Otherwise, have the
local copy shop make the posters for you. Put posters on area bul-
letin boards, in veterinarians’ offices, and at local stores. The fol-
lowing tips suggest items to include on your “Lost” poster:
 Choose the best picture of your Bulldog for your poster. 
Use a sharp black-and-white image of your dog. Keep a good
photo of your Bully on hand in case of an emergency. Try to
get an easily identifiable picture of your dog. If you have a
dark brindle Bulldog, try to take a picture of him against a
light background. If your Bulldog is mostly white, find a dark
background.
Keep up-to-date photos on hand.
 List your phone number and the general area where the dog
was lost. For instance, in the vicinity of Green Park or
between Maple and Elm Streets.
 State the dog’s sex and age. Listing the age as an approxima-
tion with a description like “puppy” or “older dog with gray
muzzle” may be more helpful than stating a specific age.
 Mention that your dog may be wearing a collar. Describe the
collar, including the color. The collar may have come off or
been taken off, but this info is still important to include.
Chapter 12: On the Go: Taking, Leaving, or Looking for Bully 175

 List the colors of your dog. This is especially important if
your photo is black and white. If your Bulldog is brindle, you
may want to say “brown and black,” mention the striped pat-
tern, or say “mostly brown” on the poster. Not everyone
knows what brindle is.
 Offer a reward. But don’t specify the amount on the poster.
Posters are an excellent way to get the most information out to the
public. There are other ways to get the word out that your dog is
missing:
 Go door to door. Ask your immediate neighbors to keep an
eye out for your dog. Leave them a poster.
 Recruit children. They probably cover more territory on foot
than the adults in your neighborhood do, and they may be
more apt to notice a dog.
Don’t actually encourage children to try to catch your dog.
Ask them to come to you and lead you to the dog, or to tell
their parents and have them call you. A lost dog is frequently
a frightened dog, and you don’t want him chased farther
away. You also don’t want to run the risk of your dog’s biting
someone out of fear.
 Call area veterinary hospitals. A chance exists that your dog
was hit by a car and taken to a veterinarian. Call repeatedly.
 Check with your local animal shelter. Go in person, and look
at the dogs. Don’t rely on phone calls, and don’t rely on
having someone at a shelter call you.
• Leave your name and phone number, of course, but
also check in person. Notes can be lost, and shelter per-
sonnel may change. Hard as it may be to believe, the
person you talk to may not know what a Bulldog is. He
may have seen your dog and thought that she was a
mixed breed.
• Go look at the dogs claimed as strays. Go look at least
every other day.
• Show the staff pictures of your dog.
• Visit distant shelters. If another shelter is 20 or 30 miles
away, visit it too. Dogs, even Bulldogs, can travel amaz-
ing distances. In addition, if someone picked up your
dog and dropped her off again or lost her, she can end
up even farther away.
Part III: Training, Working, and Traveling: The Busy Bulldog 
176

 Run an ad in the lost-and-found column of your local news-
paper. Ask your area radio stations to announce your ad.
Many newspapers and radio stations are happy to run these
kinds of public-service announcements at no charge.
 Notify your breeder.
 Check with Bulldog rescue.
 Notify your local Bulldog or kennel club. Bulldog enthusiasts
can be helpful resources, and if they see a stray Bulldog, 
they can contact the correct authorities to help you get your
dog back. Dog people are generally eager to help other dog
people.

F
inding a reputable veterinarian and starting a vaccination
schedule are the first steps to ensuring that your Bulldog 
has a long and healthy life. There are many different vaccinations
available to protect your dog; your and your veterinarian will
decide together just which ones your dog will need. This chapter
also deals with alternative care, allergies, and internal and external
parasites that can affect your pet’s health. There’s information on
holistic care and massage therapy, as well as how to protect your
Bully from fleas and ticks.
Choosing a Veterinarian
Many choices exist today for your Bulldog’s care. As you may have
read in other chapters, choices abound for all categories: feeding,
training, and even playing. Medicine is no different. Ideally, you
want to choose a veterinarian before you pick up your puppy. Your
breeder may also want to know who your vet is or if you have made
the effort to look for one before you get your pup. You can just flip
through the yellow pages and pick a name you like, but the results
may be better if you take a little more time and care to select your
veterinarian and weigh your options. You and your veterinarian
work together to keep your Bulldog healthy for several years, and
you want to have a good working relationship.

Making an informed decision
Depending on the area where you live, your choices of vets may be
limited. Assuming that you have choices, consider the following
list when choosing a veterinarian:
 Who do you know who owns a Bulldog? If your breeder lives
in your area, ask her what vet she uses and why. Ask other
your local Bulldog club and dog people, and especially try to
talk to other Bulldog owners.
 Do you want to take your dog to a multidoctor or a single-
doctor facility? Taking your dog to a small practice may mean
that the veterinarian knows your dog better, but if an emer-
gency arises and your vet isn’t available, the interim doctor
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
182
Counting the cost of veterinarian care
Many times people complain about the cost of a veterinary visit. So far, dog medicine
is still cheaper than human medicine, but like people medicine, veterinarian medicine
advances all the time. Veterinarians work hard to prevent illness as much as they do
to cure it, and your vet may try to find the underlying cause of a problem and not just
treat symptoms. This research into your Bulldog’s condition may mean that the vet
needs to take measures beyond a regular visit: blood tests, x-rays, and maybe even
a trip to a specialist. You should ask your veterinarian for explanations and alternative
solutions, and you can always seek a second opinion, but don’t skimp when it comes
to your Bully’s health.
Some veterinarian offices offer payment plans for procedures that cost hundreds or
thousands of dollars. Before you arrange for procedures for your Bully, ask your vet
about payment options.
There are numerous pet health insurance companies that offer policies to cover some
bills and emergencies. The AKC offers one now as well, and when puppies are reg-
istered with AKC, they are now automatically eligible for two months of free trial cov-
erage. Plans vary as to what is covered, and most (if not all) will not cover what they
consider to be congenital, hereditary, or breed-specific illness. However, they can
really help defray the costs of injuries and acquired illness. Some will even cover
cancer. All are applicable to broken bones, swallowed foreign bodies, poisoning, and
more. As an unexpected emergency and subsequent bill may mean deciding between
treatment or the agonizing decision to euthanize or give up a pet, veterinary health
insurance is a very important consideration for most pet owners.
Your Bulldog will never ask for a pair of high-priced sneakers (although she may chew
on a pair or two). You won’t need to pay for an expensive wedding or for college tuition.
Your car insurance won’t go up because of your dog, and she’ll never beg you for a
car. Be thankful that veterinary medicine has advanced, and pay the bill.

won’t know your Bully. In a multidoctor practice, you may not
always see the same veterinarian, but if an emergency occurs,
the on-call veterinarian has access to all your dog’s health
records.
 Can you find a veterinarian who understands the potential
problems of the Bulldog breed? These veterinarians are
more aware of what to look for when they’re examining your
puppy.
 How far are you willing to drive? A highly recommended vet-
erinarian may practice 50 miles away, and you may not mind
the drive for scheduled visits, but if your Bully has a serious
problem, will that drive mean the difference between life and
death?
Considering drive time doesn’t mean that you should go to
the veterinarian right next door if you don’t like or trust him.
Try a veterinarian somewhere in between the two extremes.
Alternatively, you can choose to have a backup veterinarian
(one you’ve seen once or twice and can use in emergencies).
 What kind of emergency coverage is offered? In a multiple-
veterinarian practice, doctors likely have staggered hours. If
only one veterinarian practices, how are vacations and off
hours handled?
 Is the staff friendly? Is the waiting room clean? If possible,
visit different veterinarians’ offices. Ask how they handle
emergencies, and find out what their hours are. When I need a
veterinarian, I want to know that the staff believes me when I
say that I have an emergency and not try to give me an
appointment in three days.
 Are you willing to go through trial and error? It may not be
possible to find the perfect veterinarian (if the perfect vet
exists) without some trial and error. Friends may recommend
a particular practice, but you just don’t feel comfortable
there. No matter how highly recommended a practice is, if
you don’t feel comfortable, don’t stay.
 What complaints have you heard? If someone complains
about a veterinarian, consider the complaint. Was it a one-
time incident or something chronic, like a dirty exam room?
Questioning your veterinarian
You need to be comfortable with how your veterinarian treats your
Bulldog, and waiting for an emergency is not the time to search for
a doctor you like. Depending on your Bully’s level of care, you may
want to ask some of the following questions at your next visit:
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 183

 What shots do you recommend?
 How frequently do you give shots?
 How do you place referrals?
Most vet referrals tend to be for traditional specialists, such
as orthopedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, and oncology.
You should not only be appreciative when a veterinarian
makes a referral, but also should actually insist on it or seek
one on your own if your regular vet is floundering with an
issue. (See the section “Finding a Specialist,” later in the chap-
ter.) Owners need to be advocates for their pets’ health!
 Do you practice alternative approaches to veterinarian 
medicine?
• Do you use acupuncture or homeopathic remedies?
• If not, can you recommend practitioners should I con-
sider alternative forms of medicine?
• If you’re a strong believer in alternatives to traditional
Western veterinary practices and the veterinarian
you’ve selected is totally against them, find another
practice. 
Selecting Alternative Medicine
While some pet owners feel that traditional veterinarian medicine
is the way to go, others may choose a more holistic approach to
solving the ailments of their Bullies.
Holistic medicine approaches the prevention and treatment of dis-
ease through examining the whole of your Bully (not just the part
that is wrong with her) and her physical and social environment.
Our society is accustomed to synthetic drugs that stop symptoms
quickly. But in many cases, problems recur because they are
merely suppressed, not cured. Holistic methods seek to cure prob-
lems, not just treat the symptoms. This therapy results in a more
permanent solution and a healthier pet. Holistic medicine
embraces different categories under its approach:
 Acupuncture
 Applied kinesiology
 Behavior problems
 Chiropractic
 Contact Reflex Analysis

Homeopathic care
Homeopathy follows the theory that like heals like. Homeopathic
practitioners compare the theory of homeopathy with vaccines;
“like” substances, weakened or killed germs, are used to prevent
the disease the germs would cause if the germs were full strength.
The like substances are diluted in several stages for safety and to
prevent side effects, yet the substance is still powerful enough to
act as a healing agent. Homeopathic remedies come in tablets,
powders, granules, liquids, and ointments.
Homeopathic treatment consists of highly individualized plans of
healing based on genetic history; personal health history; body
type; and present status of all physical, emotional, and mental
symptoms.
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 185

There are 235 homeopathic veterinarians listed at the American
Holistic Veterinary Medicine Association Web site, www.ahvma.
org. but this list is only for those belonging to the AHVMA. Many
other veterinarians may also apply homeopathic treatment or com-
bine it with traditional Western approaches to healing.
Consult your veterinarian or find a homeopathic veterinarian if you
think this approach is right for your dog. “Do it yourself” treatment
can do more harm than good.
Chinese herbal medicine
A doctor may have “TCM” listed after her name, indicating that she
practices traditional Chinese medicine, including use of herbs in
treatment. Herbal medicines may be gentler and safer than syn-
thetic compounds when correctly used.
Don’t dash off to the drugstore or health-food store and give your
dog herbals just because herbs are “natural.” Consult a veterinar-
ian who understands the correct way to use herbs to heal.
Chinese medicine also uses certain herbal treatments. Herbs are
pungent, sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Pungent herbs help with cir-
culation. Sweet herbs relieve pain and slow progression of dis-
eases. Sour herbs are used to solidify. For example, if your dog has
diarrhea, a sour herb would be prescribed. Salty herbs soften hard-
ened tissue and are used for constipation. They may also help with
muscle spasms and enlarged lymph glands. Bitter herbs are used
with kidney-related diseases.
Acupuncture
More veterinary practices are going beyond traditional Western
medicine to treat pets. Acupuncture is one of those practices that
is gaining acceptance. Acupuncturists have treated animals for
about 2,000 years and humans for more than 4,500 years.
Acupuncture is the process of stimulating acupoints on the skin by
using hair-fine needles and is said to improve healing.
Acupoints are areas on the skin that contain concentrated levels of
nerve endings, lymphatics, and blood vessels. Acupoints are iden-
tified by their lower electrical resistance and are usually located in
small depressions detectable by trained acupuncturists.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
186

Studies have shown that acupuncture increases blood flow, lowers
heart rate, and improves immune-system function. Acupuncture
also prompts the release of neurotransmitters such as endorphins,
the body’s natural painkillers, and smaller amounts of cortisal, an
anti-inflammatory steroid. This release of natural painkillers
lessens the need for pain medication.
Additionally, acupuncture frequently treats chronic conditions 
like arthritis and allergies. Epilepsy may also be helped by
acupuncture, as well as skin conditions and side effects from
cancer.
Besides using acupuncture to treat specific conditions, “alarm
points” on the body help indicate what is wrong with your Bully.
No reaction may occur when an alarm point is stimulated, but if 
a problem with a specific organ exists, stimulating the alarm 
point may cause a reaction from your dog. He may try to bite.
Many acupuncturists use acupuncture to complement Western
medicine. Doctors diagnose based on Western medicine and then
use acupuncture to help ease pain and hasten healing. An acupunc-
turist may also encourage an owner to manipulate acupressure
points at home between treatments. Acupressure is acupuncture
without the needles.
To understand more about acupuncture or to find a veterinarian in
your area who practices acupuncture, the International Veterinary
Acupuncture Society lists certified veterinary acupuncturists by
state at its Web site, www.ivas.org.
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 187
The healing power of plants
Bach flower essences are often mentioned along with herbal and homeopathic
treatments. In the 1800s, English doctor Edward Bach began studying the healing
properties of various plants. He eventually identified 38 flowers and trees with spe-
cific healing properties for emotional and behavioral problems, such as shyness,
fear, and anxiety.
Rescue Remedy is a mixture of five of the single Bach flower essences and is effec-
tive in cases of shock, collapse, and trauma. Many holistic veterinarians recom-
mend Rescue Remedy as a part of your dog’s first-aid kit. Check your local
health-food store for this product.

Finding a Specialist
A time may come when neither a general-practice veterinarian nor
a holistic vet can help your Bully. You may need to take your dog
to a specialist. Specialists practice in all medical fields, but
common ailments that befall Bulldogs can be covered by a chiro-
practor and a masseuse.
Chiropractic care
Chiropractic treatment is the manipulating of the spine and con-
nected bones. Chiropractic theory states that when the spine 
and bones are even slightly displaced, nerves become irritated.
Chiropractors gently push the bones back into their correct places.
If your Bulldog is extremely active (well, as active as he can be), the
occasional chiropractic adjustment may be just what he needs. If
you and your Bully practice agility, you may want to seek chiroprac-
tic care more often as a preventive measure against back pain and
problems. Even a couch-potato Bulldog may benefit from an adjust-
ment if he lands wrong jumping down from his comfy nest.
Many people take their dogs to chiropractors for humans if a vet-
erinarian does not offer the service. If you choose this course of
treatment, make sure that your regular veterinarian has examined
your dog first to make sure that no other cause, like a tumor, may
be pushing on your dog’s spine and causing his pain.
For more chiropractic information, visit www.animal
chiropractic.org, the Web site of the American Veterinary
Chiropractic Association.
Massage therapy
Although massage therapy may not be considered a medical treat-
ment (although it is in my book), it is a wonderful way to relax
your dog. Linda Tellington-Jones developed a method of massage
called the Tellington Touch or Touch, in which repeated massage
movements generate specific brain-wave patterns that help your
Bully who is suffering from anxiety, especially following injury or
surgery. The calming effect of the massage helps promote healing.
Your dog doesn’t have to be suffering from injury or recovering
from surgery for you to give him a massage. A massage can soothe
tired muscles and just plain feels good. Besides relaxing your dog,
massage may strengthen the bond between you and your Bully.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
188

When massaging your dog, pay attention to how he reacts. If your
techniques seem to annoy or hurt your dog, stop! This tip may
seem obvious, but you may love massage so much that you forget
to make sure that your dog does too. If he whines, growls, or
twitches, he may be trying to tell you that he doesn’t like what
you’re doing. When you are pulling him out from under the bed for
the daily massage, think about the moment you read this, and
reconsider who benefits from that massage.
Massage is no substitute for veterinary care. Even after massage
sessions, if your Bully consistently limps or is in pain, make an
appointment with your veterinarian.
While you may not feel comfortable with every type of alternative
to traditional veterinary care, you may come to appreciate a veteri-
narian who tries many different treatments to provide the best pos-
sible healthcare to his patients. Many alternatives are, in fact,
complementary to traditional medicine. If your veterinarian does
not use any complementary systems, ask for referrals if you feel
that may help your Bulldog.
Knowing Your Vaccinations
A few years ago, “vaccination facts” would have been a no-brainer.
Veterinarians vaccinated for just about everything that had a vac-
cine, and the shots were given every year. Combination vaccines
were the norm, usually including five or six different vaccines in
one shot. Ouch! Veterinarians gave the combination shot and
rabies shot during the same office visit as well.
Circumstances are a bit different now. Veterinarians are moving
away from combination shots that include vaccines against distem-
per, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, and Parvovirus. Many
vets vaccinate only against distemper and Parvovirus and give the
required rabies shot, giving other vaccinations based on what may
be needed for a specific dog in a specific area. Veterinarians now
may also split up the visits for shots.
A rabies shot is required by law in every state. While some states
require the shot every year, others only have a once-every-3-years
policy. Check with your veterinarian to find out the regulation in
your state.
Talk to your veterinarian about her methods of vaccination and for
what diseases she inoculates. Many veterinarians vaccinate young
dogs or dogs who travel frequently, such as show dogs, every year,
while older or stay-at-home dogs may receive vaccinations only
once every 3 years.
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 189

Giving vaccinations at more than one appointment doesn’t
mean that your veterinarian is trying to get more money from
you. Multiple visits may mean that your vet is concerned
about your Bulldog and wants to prevent problems that may
arise from multiple-vaccine shots. A mild reaction can be
swelling at the site of the injection. If your dog has an allergic
reaction, he may itch or have hives, his head and face may
swell, or he may vomit or have diarrhea.
Administering puppy 
and booster shots
Depending on the age of your Bulldog puppy, he may have already
received his first set of vaccinations. Schedule an appointment
with your veterinarian so you can get your Bully’s shots within the
time frame of your breeder’s health guarantee — typically, within
48 hours of bringing your puppy home.
Currently, many veterinarians give the first set of shots at 8 weeks,
then 12 weeks, 16 weeks, and annually. Some veterinarians may
recommend shots at 18 to 20 weeks and then annually. Check with
your breeder to see what, if any, shots have been given to your
puppy.
Some dogs have an allergic reaction to shots. The first time your
puppy gets a vaccination, stay at the veterinarian’s office for a
while to see if your Bulldog is going to have a reaction to the shot.
If he does, the staff is available to counteract the reaction.
Warding off diseases
What exactly are the diseases your dog may be vaccinated against?
While many diseases and ailments may befall your Bulldog, you
need to be proactive in your dog’s care and vaccinate against cer-
tain viruses to help keep your Bully healthy for years to come.
Bordetella
Bordetella, or kennel cough, presents in over 100 varieties, and the
bordetella vaccination protects against only a few varieties. If you
plan on leaving your Bulldog at a kennel while you are on vacation
or for any reason, most boarding kennels require the bordetella
vaccination before your Bully can stay there. If you’re traveling a
lot or showing, you may also want to vaccinate against bordetella
because kennel cough is highly contagious. If you decide that you
want your dog to have this shot, keep in mind that even with the
shot, your Bully may still develop kennel cough. Treat kennel
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
190

cough with antibiotics, and while any disease is cause for concern,
kennel cough is not usually serious. If your dog has a dry, hacking
cough and has recently been around other dogs, he may have
kennel cough. Check with your veterinarian.
Coronavirus
Coronavirus causes weeklong diarrhea and is contagious. Diarrhea
may be orange-tinted and have a strong odor. This disease, while
rarely fatal, causes dehydration. Talk to your veterinarian about
the need for this shot. A healthy, mostly indoor Bulldog may never
need this shot, but the vaccination is advisable for a show dog or a
Bulldog who regularly encounters many other dogs.
Distemper
Distemper, which has a low recovery rate, is a dangerous and
highly contagious virus. The threat for distemper is greatest for
Bulldogs under 6 months of age and over 6 years of age. Symptoms
include vomiting, coughing, and fever; the disease typically ends in
death.
Hepatitis
A Bulldog with a mild to moderate case of hepatitis will have a
fever and be lethargic. He may also be reluctant to move and have
abdominal tenderness and pale mucous membranes. Bulldogs usu-
ally recover anywhere from 1 to 5 days after showing symptoms. In
severe cases, your Bulldog may vomit, have diarrhea, and develop
a cough. Sudden death may result. The virus spreads through the
feces and urine of dogs.
Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is a bacteria frequently transmitted through the
urine of rats and mice. Symptoms include vomiting, fever, and a
reluctance to move. Signs of renal failure may also exist. With renal
failure, your dog may urinate more frequently, as the kidneys work
harder and less efficiently, or your dog may stop urinating altogeth-
er. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to your veterinarian
immediately. Severe cases of leptospirosis can be fatal. Protect
your Bulldog against leptospirosis if you live in an area of exposure
to urine of rats and mice; otherwise, you may be able to skip this
shot. The leptospirosis vaccine in combination shots seems to
increase the risk of a reaction in dogs, but a newer type of vaccine
has been developed that causes less reaction and can be given as a
separate shot. Consult your veterinarian.
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 191

Lyme disease
The deer tick spreads Lyme disease, a disease that causes lethargy,
loss of appetite, and lameness. The disease can be treated with
antibiotics. Some vaccination recommendations depend on where
you live or what you’re doing with your Bulldog. Lyme disease is
more prevalent in the East. If you live in the East, you may want to
have your dog vaccinated. Ask your veterinarian if this disease is a
problem in your area.
Parvovirus
Parvovirus (Parvo) is another potentially fatal disease, particularly
if the symptoms include vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Your Bully
may show signs of a fever, lethargy, and depression. A dog with a
mild case of Parvo may recover, but young puppies are highly sus-
ceptible and generally don’t survive. 
Early shots are important in the prevention of this fatal disease.
Rabies
The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system of Bulldogs
and spreads through saliva. Common carriers in the wild include
bats, foxes, raccoons, and skunks. Rabies is considered a fatal dis-
ease. After symptoms appear, a cure is not an option. Only vaccina-
tion, which is required by law for all dogs, prevents rabies.
Mulling Over Medicines
A time may come when your veterinarian will prescribe some form
of medication for your Bulldog. Usually, the dosage will be in pill
form. If it’s an antibiotic, make sure that you give it all, even if your
dog seems to have completely recovered. Using all the medicine
ensures that the infection doesn’t have a chance to flare up again.
Each day that you are giving the antibiotic, also give your Bully 
a spoonful of yogurt that contains active cultures. Antibiotics,
besides going after the “bad guys,” also destroy beneficial bacteria
in your dog’s intestines. The yogurt’s active cultures will help
replenish the good bacteria in your dog’s system.
Pills are one of the easiest forms of medication to give a Bulldog.
Many dogs gulp down a pill all by itself or if it’s just lying casually
on top of their food. If your dog is a bit more discriminating, wrap-
ping a bit of food around the pill will make it acceptable. The food
(anything that your dog eats quickly) can be almost anything that
hides the pill:
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
192

 A pat of butter
 Canned food
 Cream cheese
 Hot dogs (Stuff the pill inside the hot dog)
 Yogurt
Peanut butter may not be the ideal choice for covering a pill.
Peanut butter sticks to the elongated soft palate of your Bully, and
the peanut butter may be hard to remove or cause choking issues
for your Bulldog.
Liquid medications can be a bit harder unless they’re flavored to
appeal to your dog or are neutral enough to be accepted when
mixed with your dog’s food. If mixing with food doesn’t work, pull
your dog’s lower lip out to the side to make a pocket, and squirt or
pour in the liquid. Quickly close your dog’s mouth, keep it shut,
and gently stroke his throat until he swallows. You may need a
helper for this project.
An eye problem requires drops or an ointment or both. The best
way to approach the eye is from the rear:
1. Straddle your Bully.
2. Stand pigeon-toed so that your feet are under your dog.
This stance prevents your Bully from backing out between
your legs.
3. Tip your dog’s head back slightly.
4. Squeeze the drops into the inner corner of the eye.
Chapter 13: Knowing Your Veterinarian 193
Dealing with dehydration
Severe vomiting or diarrhea can leave your dog dehydrated, and your veterinarian
may suggest Gatorade or Pediolyte to replace the fluids your dog has lost. These
fluids are fine suggestions except that in my experience, your dog won’t like either
one. Try them, by all means, but don’t be surprised if your Bully turns up his nose
even further.
My dogs consider ice cubes a treat, so I give those. If your dog won’t crunch up
enough ice cubes to do any good, offer chicken or beef bouillon. Besides the liquid
of the bouillon, the salty taste may send them to their water bowl. Water drained
from a can of tuna fish may flavor a bowl of water enough to get your dog drinking.

If you need to apply salve, follow the same procedure, except that
you should start at the outer corner of the eye. Slightly pull the
lower lid away, and put in the salve. Then hold the eye closed for a
few seconds so that the salve will melt and spread over the surface
of the eye.

Bulldog Health Issues
In This Chapter

B
ulldogs are a unique breed and experience health issues 
that are common to the breed. This chapter highlights breed-
specific conditions and how to recognize them, as well as address-
ing general health.
Generally, any problem that lasts longer than 24 hours needs a 
trip to the veterinarian. Also, any problem that gets progressively
worse over several hours — such as loss of appetite, weakness, 
or fever — needs attention from your veterinarian.
The longer you have your Bulldog, the better you’ll be able to tell
whether a stomach upset just requires some cooked meat and rice
to correct it or whether you need your veterinarian, but when in
doubt, make the appointment. Bulldogs are sturdy dogs, but com-
pared to a human, they don’t weigh much. A dog can “go downhill”
much faster than a human with a comparable health problem.
Spaying or Neutering Your Bulldog
After vaccinations (see Chapter 13), spaying or neutering is likely
the first major health issue you’ll have to address with your
Bulldog. For various reasons, spaying or neutering is a good idea if
you don’t plan to either show or breed your Bulldog. Breeding is
not for the faint of heart no matter what the breed, but with

Bulldogs, it is even harder. If you’re thinking about breeding, skip
to Chapter 18 immediately.
When a dog has an operation to become sterile, no matter what
the gender, the animal is neutered. With a female, the removal of
the ovaries is a spay. With a male, the removal of the testicles is
castration. Commonly, though, while the term spay is still used with
females, neutering applies to the operation performed on males. So
I’m using the terms spaying and neutering as opposed to spaying
and castrating.
Neither spaying nor neutering is particularly hard on a healthy
young dog. Spaying takes longer because the surgery is performed
abdominally. Neutering is easier and quicker because the testicles
are external. If you’re concerned about appearance, ask your 
veterinarian about a vasectomy, which is a more complicated 
operation.
Before any surgery, make sure that your veterinarian knows that 
a Bulldog may have problems breathing after the operation when
the ventilating tube has been removed but the dog is not yet fully
conscious.
When your Bully is neutered, he is first anesthetized; then an 
incision is made at the base of the scrotum, and the testicles are
removed. When a female is spayed, a short incision is made in the
abdomen. The veterinarian draws out the ovaries and uterus, ties
off the blood vessels, cuts the uterus and ovaries free, and stitches
up the incision.
With both operations, most veterinarians want to keep your Bully
overnight to make sure that your dog recovers fully from the anes-
thetic. About ten days after the operation, you’ll return to the vet-
erinarian to have the stitches removed.
With a spay incision especially, keep an eye on it. If you notice any
redness or puffiness, call your veterinarian. It can be a sign of infec-
tion. Also, keep an eye on your dog, and make sure she doesn’t try
to remove the stitches herself before it’s time.
Watch your Bully’s weight after spaying or neutering because the
metabolism does change a bit. None of my females ever gained any
weight after being spayed, but after neutering, my male did start to
gain weight. Cutting back his food by about half a cup got him back
to his normal weight.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
196

What to know about male Bulldogs
Sometime between 6 months and 2 years, your male dog becomes
sexually mature. (It may take a Bulldog 4 years to reach full physi-
cal maturity.) He’ll start to exercise his authority a little more
around the house (and the neighborhood):
 He may become more aggressive toward other males.
 He will definitely become more interested in females, espe-
cially females in season. Around such a female, he will pay
more attention to her than to you. Because of this attraction,
if an intact male gets loose, he’s more apt to wander farther
from home than a neutered male.
 He’ll lift his leg to urinate more frequently on walks as a way
to let other males know that the neighborhood is his territory.
 He may also start marking the house with his urine, which can
be a hard habit to break.
Intact males are more apt to suffer from prostatic hypertrophy,
which is a benign enlargement of the prostate. Neutering prevents
prostate problems, may curb aggression toward other males, and
may end marking in the house.
Some neutered males may continue to mark, but if marking is a
problem, neutering is definitely worth a try. My male was con-
stantly marking the furniture, and I went through rolls and rolls of
paper towels and tried every cleaning product available. I was told
that his behavior patterns were set and that it was unlikely that
neutering would have any effect on his marking at all. When he was
6, I brought a female home, and not wanting to deal with keeping
him away from her when she was in season, I had him neutered.
He’s never marked since.
What to know about female Bulldogs
If you have a female, look for her to come in season sometime
between 6 months and 18 months. After her first season, she will
cycle about every 6 months after that. Ask your breeder about the
females in her pedigree, so you’ll have a rough idea of what to
expect.
A female is in season for 21 days but is receptive to a male for only
3 to 5 of those days. Females produce a bloody discharge while in
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 197

heat, and how much discharge you see will vary, but you may want
to keep your female in a room without carpeting while she’s in
season. If you also own a male, you may want to board your
female. Keeping the two separate can be difficult, as males are per-
sistent, and 3 weeks can seem like an eternity.
If you have a fenced yard and let your female out unattended, make
sure ahead of time that your fence has no holes or gaps and is high
enough to prevent any wandering males from jumping in. All the
boys in the neighborhood will be interested, not just other Bulldogs.
If you’re walking your Bully, keep a grip on the lead, and be alert to
the approach of any romantic males.
With females, besides the benefits of no unwanted litters, a spayed
female has less chance of getting mammary tumors if spayed
before her third season. After that, the incidence of tumors is not
much different. Spaying also eliminates the risk of Pyometra, which
is relatively common in Bulldogs and which can be life threatening,
as well as other possible infections of the reproductive system.
Alleviating Canine Allergies
Allergies commonly occur, and you should keep an eye out for
these sensitivities in your Bulldog. When you’re checking your dog
for fleas and ticks, look at his skin as well. Allergies cause itchy
skin, so check for red patches, scratches, or anything that isn’t
clean healthy skin.
Dogs, just like people, can be allergic to food, mold, and pollen. If
your dog seems to present problems during certain seasons, the
allergy can be “something in the air.” If the irritation continues, try
checking other sources
Figuring out food allergies
Your dog’s allergic reactions may derive from his food. If your
Bully’s reaction is not too severe, you may have time to try differ-
ent foods. Look at the grain in your dog food, and switch to a food
with a different grain. Corn, wheat, and soy grains most generally
cause allergy problems.
If your dog’s condition worsens or is severe, make a trip to the vet-
erinarian, who may run a series of tests and also suggest a food
made of all one product. These special diets have just one ingredi-
ent, such as duck, and by gradually adding other foods (a lengthy
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
198

process, but a necessary one), you can eventually determine the
cause of the allergy. See Chapter 7 for more information on food
allergies and options.
Flea saliva
Your dog may also be allergic to flea saliva. If a flea has bitten your
Bulldog, the bite may become irritated through biting and scratch-
ing from your dog. Prolonged agitation may cause a raw, red, oozy-
looking spot called a hot spot.
Hot spots generally can be treated with a triple antibiotic oint-
ment. If the spot does not get better or is left untreated, an infec-
tion can occur and then a trip to the vet will be inevitable.
Mold, pollen, fungus
Dogs, like people, can be allergic to airborne particles, such as
pollen and mold and fungus spores. It can be hard to determine
just what particular plant is causing the problem, other than to
observe what time of the year your dog is bothered and what
plants are in your area at the time. Talk to your veterinarian about
whether or not your Bully may need an antihistamine. 
Whether or not an allergy of any kind exists, if your Bully is contin-
ually licking or biting an area on his body, he may develop a hot
spot, and you may want to get him checked out.
Preventing External Parasites
Depending on where you live and the time of year you get your
Bully, you may already have encountered fleas or ticks. 
Making fleas flee
Fleas are nasty little critters, and if your dog is allergic to flea
saliva, they can make your pet miserable. Be aggressive when fight-
ing fleas. In northern areas, where winter arrives with a lot of cold
weather, expect a short break. If you live in a warmer climate, you
face a year-round battle, but desert areas are virtually flea free.
The flea generally seen on dogs is a cat flea and is not native to this
continent but is originally from Africa. It is becoming resistant to
many flea-control products on the market.
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 199

If your dog is scratching, and you suspect fleas, check any white
areas of fur and push the hair against the grain, or turn your dog
over and check toward the hind legs, where the fur is thinner.
When you push the hair away from the body, you may see a flea or
two running for cover. If you don’t see any fleas, check for small
flecks of flea dirt. If you can’t tell if what you’re looking at is flea
dirt or just a bit of regular dirt, collect some on a piece of paper or
a paper towel, and wet it. If it turns red, it’s flea dirt. Flea dirt is flea
excrement, and it turns red from the blood it’s been enjoying from
your dog.
If you don’t see anything on your dog but still suspect fleas, run a
flea comb through your dog’s coat. Flea combs have very fine,
closely set teeth that trap fleas and flea dirt. 
Fighting fleas with medicine
After you’ve determined that your dog has fleas, the war has
begun. If your dog has a heavy infestation, start with a bath using a
flea-fighting shampoo. Wash all bedding, as that is where the fleas
lay their eggs.
If you decide to use a topical flea preventive, your veterinarian can
help you choose the one for your dog. Many different products are
sold on the market and through your veterinarian that can help
you eliminate fleas:
 Program: Ingested monthly, this medication may be used
safely with other flea-control products. Program acts as a
birth-control method for fleas. The flea absorbs the medica-
tion from the blood of your dog, and Program prevents a
cocoon from forming, so the flea larvae never develop into
adults.
 Frontline: This topical preventive for fleas also fights ticks for
17 days.
 Advantage: I use Advantage, another monthly topical preven-
tive, and have had good luck with it.
If heavy infestation occurs, bathe your dog with a flea-fighting
shampoo before trying the topical medications. For your home,
you should consider hiring an extermination company that special-
izes in fleas.
If you’d like to fight the fleas with fewer chemicals, try feeding your
Bulldog garlic several times a week. You can buy garlic capsules,
and most dogs love garlic, even if it doesn’t repel the fleas. You can
have too much of a good thing, however, so don’t overdo the
garlic. 
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
200

Keeping the house and yard clean
Daily vacuuming works just as effectively as any spray in keeping
the flea population down in the house. You can cut up a flea collar
and put it in the vacuum bag to help kill the fleas. Also, change the
vacuum bag frequently (when the bag is half full) to prevent a flea
colony from growing in the bag. Wash your dog’s bed, where most
of the flea eggs accumulate, frequently. Combing your dog with a
flea comb also helps trap the unwanted guests.
Help keep your yard flea free by planting marigolds. You can also
use diatomaceous earth inside and out. Diatomaceous earth helps
dehydrate the fleas.
Avon’s Skin-So-Soft control bugs, even though the product was not
invented as a bug repellent. Don’t overdo it, but a light application
helps control the blood-sucking pests. Be sure to monitor your dog
in case he reacts to the Skin-So-Soft. Exchanging fleas for a rash is
not the point in eliminating fleas.
Flea collars tend to keep your dog’s neck free of fleas but don’t do
much over the rest of the body. You can, however, cut up a flea
collar and put it in your vacuum bag to help kill fleas that you suck
up. Change the vacuum bag frequently, or you’ll end up with a flea
colony in the bag.
Getting ticked off
Ticks may be a problem in your area. If you take long walks in tall
grass or through brush, the likelihood of picking up ticks increases
(for both you and your dog). Most ticks are relatively small, and
you may find them on your dog by touch faster than by sight. Ticks
feast on your dog’s blood and create a large, dark bump buried in
his fur. The bump is actually the tick itself.
Checking your dog regularly for ticks prevents further health prob-
lems for your dog. Don’t leave ticks on your dog. Ticks can be hard
to find even on a short-coated dog like the Bulldog, so be patient
and thorough. If you don’t think that you can get the tick off prop-
erly or just don’t want to try, make an appointment to visit the vet-
erinarian so he can perform the procedure.
Place a touch of rubbing alcohol on the tick to shut down the
oxygen supply, and the tick may back out of your dog on its own.
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 201

You can remove ticks gently with tweezers, being extremely careful
not to leave the head behind. Follow these procedures:
1. Grasp the tick with the tweezers where the mouth parts
enter the skin.
Don’t use your fingers.
2. Pull steadily and slowly until the tick comes away from
the dog.
Dispose of the tick so that it can no longer affect your dog
or your family.
3. Wash the site after the tick has been removed.
Never use a cigarette or burning agents to extract a tick.
Undoubtedly, you would get the tick’s attention, but you are also
apt to burn your dog.
Four types of ticks can affect your dog: the Rocky Mountain wood
tick, the American dog tick, the brown dog tick, and the deer tick.
All of these ticks, with the exception of the deer tick, are the size of
a watermelon seed. The deer tick is the size of a freckle. The Rocky
Mountain wood tick is a more robust, husky tick with a rounded,
thicker body.
The following diseases or conditions are spread by ticks:
 Rocky Mountain spotted fever: This disease is spread by the
Rocky Mountain wood tick; this tick has been found in almost
every state and in Canada. Symptoms can include fever,
lethargy, vomiting, refusing food, and skin rashes.
 Tularemia: Highly infectious, tularemia is also considered a
potential biological-warfare agent. Tularemia occurs naturally
throughout the United States. Most cases have been reported
from the central states of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.
There has been a decline in the number of cases over the past
several decades. This disease is spread by the American dog
tick.
 Tick paralysis: Certain ticks can cause a progressive paraly-
sis, which is reversed upon removal of the tick. Recovery is
usually complete. The paralysis isn’t caused by a disease
pathogen but by a toxin produced by the tick. Paralysis
begins in the extremities of the body with a loss of coordina-
tion. It progresses to the face, with corresponding slurred
speech and, finally, shallow, irregular breathing. Failure to
remove the tick can result in death by respiratory failure.
Most cases of tick paralysis are caused by the Rocky
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
202

Mountain wood tick in northwestern states. The American
dog tick has also been known to cause tick paralysis.
 Human ehrlichiosis: This is a human disease that can also
affect dogs. The disease causes fever, nausea, vomiting, rash,
and weight loss. This is carried by the brown dog tick and the
deer tick.
 Human babesiosis: This disease causes hemolytic anemia.
The disease is most dangerous to puppies. Attachment to
people is uncommon. Babesiosis is a malarialike illness
caused mainly by Babesia microti, a protozoan parasite of red
blood cells. Signs and symptoms include fever, fatigue, chills,
sweats, headache, and muscle pain, beginning usually 1 to 6
weeks after the tick bite. This is carried by the brown dog tick
and the deer tick.
 Lyme disease: This disease is spread by deer ticks. Ask your
vet if this presents a concern in your area. You can obtain a
vaccine for Lyme disease. Symptoms include a rash, usually
spreading outward from the tick bite; muscle stiffness; and
lethargy.
Ear mites
If your Bully is scratching his ears constantly, or rubbing his head
along the carpet or a piece of furniture, make an appointment with
your veterinarian, and have him check your dog’s ears. Because
ear mites can live on other areas of the body as well as the ears,
you may need to dust your Bulldog with flea powder or have him
sprayed or dipped for 3 to 4 weeks, which covers the 3-week life
cycle of the mite. Ear mites are more common in cats than in dogs,
so this problem may not occur for you and your Bully.
Mange
Two types of mange exist that can affect your Bully, and tiny mites
cause both types. Sarcoptic mange is most noted by intense itch-
ing, and as the mange advances, skin lesions and hair loss occur.
Sarcoptic mange is treated externally with sulfur dips and inter-
nally with ivermectin. Revolution, a monthly flea and tick preven-
tive, is also an effective treatment. Treatment lasts 3 weeks, and
your Bulldog’s bedding should be thoroughly disinfected or
thrown away.
Demodetic mange is passed from the mother to the puppies and
affects puppies between the ages of 3 and 10 months. Demodetic
mange is diagnosed by examining skin scrapings. This form of
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 203

mange doesn’t cause the intense itching that Sarcoptic mange
does. With Demodetic mange, your dog may experience hair loss.
Your veterinarian uses ivermectin to treat Demodetic mange and
may also recommend a special shampoo. If the mange isn’t wide-
spread, it may go away on its own, but if it spreads beyond small,
localized areas, it may need up to a year of treatment. Bulldogs
with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to
Demodetic mange their entire lives.
Guarding Against 
Internal Parasites
You can’t see an internal parasite by rubbing your dog’s fur the
wrong way. Your veterinarian wants to do a fecal check once or
twice a year to check for whipworms, hookworms, tapeworms, 
and roundworms. Heartworms require a blood test, and tapeworm
segments are usually evident with the naked eye.
Tapeworms
Tapeworms are the least harmful, but most common, of all the
types of worms that may infest your Bulldog. One of the ways your
dog can get tapeworms is by swallowing a flea, so controlling the
flea population prevents tapeworms in your dog. Tapeworm seg-
ments look like tiny grains of rice in your dog’s stool, so check
periodically for this evidence of tapeworms. If you never treated
for tapeworm, your dog would survive, but any parasite takes
nourishment away from its host, so your dog would want more and
more food.
Hookworms
Hookworm eggs pass through feces and can live in the soil. They
also pass from a mother to her puppies. Instead of maturing, the
larvae live in the female and then pass to the puppies through
their mother’s milk. Hookworms feed on the blood of their host
and can cause fatal anemia in puppies. Untreated adult dogs will
become anemic, and the constant irritation from the worms can
cause gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the bowel, which may
cause diarrhea and lessens the amount of nourishment the dog 
can get from food.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
204

Roundworms
Roundworms, like hookworms, can contaminate the soil, and the
eggs are highly resistant to adverse conditions. Roundworms live
in soil for years. Most puppies are born with these worms because
the larvae live in the mother but don’t infect her. Even if your
female Bully tests negative for roundworms, her puppies can still
have them. Roundworms in puppies can cause death from intes-
tinal blockage, and if the worms migrate to the lungs, they may
cause pneumonia. Adult dogs may have diarrhea and abdominal
pain, and may suffer from dehydration. 
Whipworms
Whipworms can cause a deep inflammation of the colon. If your
Bulldog has periodic bouts of diarrhea, with blood and mucus pres-
ent, whipworms may be the culprit. Left untreated, your Bully will
become dehydrated, and the inflammation of the colon will become
worse. He may suffer abdominal pain, become anemic, and lose
weight. Once again, contaminated soil is to blame, and the bad news
is that after you have whipworms in your soil, paving the entire yard
is about the only way to solve the problem. Protect your Bully with
periodic fecal checks.
Heartworms
Heartworm is a deadly parasite that doesn’t show up in fecal
checks but requires a blood test. This parasite can kill or incapaci-
tate your dog, and the cure can be almost as bad as the disease, 
so preventing heartworm is better than having to cure it.
Heartworm larvae develop in mosquitoes and enter a dog’s blood-
stream when a mosquito bites the dog. These larvae then move 
to the chambers on the right side of the dog’s heart. Once in the
heart, the worms mature and produce microfilariae, which circu-
late in the blood until another mosquito picks them up after feed-
ing on the dog. Adult heartworms can completely fill the heart
chambers. An infected dog may tire easily and develop a cough.
The annual blood test by your vet detects the presence of microfi-
lariae. Talk to your veterinarian about a monthly heartworm pre-
ventive for your dog. Some medications prevent only heartworm;
some also include chemicals that kill other worms, such as hook-
worms. A shot is also available that is effective for up to 6 months.
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 205

If you live in an area with a short mosquito season or no mosqui-
toes at all, you may opt not to give your Bully any medication, but
just have him tested every 6 months to see if he’s infected.
If your dog does contract heartworm, the first step in the cure is 
to get rid of the adult worms, which involves arsenamide injected
intravenously twice a day for 2 or 3 days. Your vet can do this for
you or show you what you need to do. The worms in the heart 
die slowly and travel to the lungs through the bloodstream. The
worms gradually disintegrate in the lungs. The worms must be 
poisoned slowly, because if all the worms were killed immediately,
simultaneous embolism can prove fatal to your dog. Even killing
the worms slowly stresses your Bulldog’s lungs and may cause per-
manent damage. Enforced rest for 4 to 6 weeks following treatment
is usual to help your Bully recover.
Recognizing Skin Problems
Bulldogs are very susceptible to skin problems, so if you notice
your dog scratching or licking, or if you observe any hair loss, red-
ness of skin, or a rash, have your veterinarian check your dog
before the problem gets worse. Most skin problems can be cured
or kept under control with medications, especially if they are not
allowed to spread. Check with your vet to make sure your dog’s
skin problems aren’t being caused by parasites or allergies, dis-
cussed earlier in the chapter.
Hot spots are raw, oozy round patches of skin and are created when
your dog bites and licks a bug bite or an itchy spot. These spots
need to be treated before they become infected. Hot spots are not
limited to Bulldogs but are common enough to cause problems. 
Use a dab of triple antibiotic cream, available at any drugstore, on
hot spots. If the spot doesn’t clear up in three or four days, see
your veterinarian, who may want to prescribe an oral antibiotic.
For more information, also see Chapter 8.
Taking Care of Interdigital Cysts
Interdigital cysts may be caused by almost anything that gets
caught between a dog’s toes and starts to work its way into the
skin, but Bulldogs are quite likely to get interdigital cysts because
of the short hairs between their toes. These short hairs can get
bent backward into their roots, and the irritation to the skin results
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
206

in a cyst, frequently filled with pus. The cysts can be painful, and
you may notice your Bulldog limping, or constantly licking or
biting his toes. There is a danger of bacterial infection if the cyst 
is left untreated.
Check with your veterinarian if your Bully gets a cyst. With time,
your veterinarian may recommend ways to treat the cyst at home,
and once you’ve dealt with a few of the cysts, you’ll get to know
how to deal with them yourself and when you need to have your
dog looked at by a professional:
 Many Bulldog breeders soak the infected paw in warm water
with Epsom salts or with an antibiotic solution added.
 Soak the paw for about 10 minutes. If your Bulldog won’t
agree to have one paw in a pan of water, use the bathtub. 
The treatment won’t do any harm to the other paws.
 After drying the paw, apply an antibiotic ointment to the cyst.
Some people use Preparation H, which seems to help.
Some breeders pop small cysts before they have time to grow to a
size that irritates the dog, but if you think that’s what you want to
do, make sure the area is clean, and watch closely for infection.
Knowing the Truth about Bulldog
Breathing Problems
Bulldogs have the unfortunate reputation for having breathing
problems, associated with small tracheas, elongated soft palates,
or stenotic nares. Not all Bulldogs have breathing problems.
Conscientious breeders are working hard to correct these prob-
lems. However, your Bully may be affected by one or more of 
these problems, and it’s a good idea to understand them and 
to know what you can do to help your dog breathe easier.
Elongated soft palate
The soft palate is the soft extension of the roof of the mouth that
forms a flexible barrier and prevents food and water from going up
the nose when your Bulldog swallows. (See Figure 14-1.) Fold your
tongue back in your own mouth, and you can feel your soft palate.
In many Bulldogs, this soft flap extends back into the throat and
can fall into the larynx when the dog breathes in. If your Bully
becomes excited or stressed and is breathing hard, the soft palate
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 207

gets longer and swells. Then your Bully is faced with the vicious
cycle of trying harder and harder to get air, and the airway becom-
ing more and more blocked. 
Figure 14-1: An elongated palate makes it harder for your Bulldog to breathe.
This phenomenon is why heatstroke is such a danger (and I men-
tion it so much), even when you may not think the weather is hot.
The soft-palate problem is also why you shouldn’t get into battles
of will with your Bulldog. Bulldogs are bred to be tenacious and
determined, but that can work against them because they won’t
give up and continue to fight. If you are trying to work with your
Bully to get him to do something, like let you cut his nails, don’t
keep struggling. The struggle can cause greater problems.
The elongated soft palate can be surgically corrected. Laser sur-
gery makes the process quick, and less bleeding and swelling
occurs with laser surgery than with other methods. Talk to your
veterinarian about whether she recommends this surgery for your
Bulldog.
Elongated-soft-palate surgery sounds simple but is actually quite
an art form, and complications can be dangerous. Owners should
seek out a veterinarian with a history of performing the surgery
successfully and with the desired results.

Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
208

Small trachea
Besides the breathing problems caused by an elongated palate,
Bulldogs may have extremely small tracheas, sometimes only the
size of a pencil in diameter. Breeders are working to correct this
problem, so your Bully may have a trachea that is normal for his
size and weight, but you should be aware that it may be a problem.
Carry a little squirt bottle filled with lemon juice and water. Lemon
juice cuts the phlegm that can build up in your dog’s throat as a
result of the elongated soft palate and the small trachea.
Stenotic nares
Stenotic nares is the technical term for pinched nostrils, and most
Bulldogs are born with this condition. The opening of their nostrils
is narrow, and the separating cartilage is soft. So when the dog
breathes, the cartilage closes in, further decreasing the size of the
opening for air. Your veterinarian can easily remove a small piece
of the wall of each nostril so your Bully can breathe easier.
Being overweight
Breathing problems increase the heavier your dog is. Don’t let your
Bully get overweight. Bulldogs are no more prone to being over-
weight than another dog, but because Bulldogs are more laid back
than many breeds, they may not get the exercise they need to burn
the food they are given. Extra pounds aren’t good for any dog. You
should be able to feel your Bully’s ribs when you run your hands
down his sides. If you can’t feel them, it’s time to cut back on a
snack or two. 
Handling Heatstroke
I mention heatstroke in Chapter 15, on first aid, but it’s here (and
throughout the book) too because various situations can lead to
your dog’s overheating, and heat can kill your Bully.
All dogs cool off by panting. By breathing quickly, Bulldogs
exchange the hotter air in their lungs for the cooler outside air. The
air moving over the tongue also helps in the cooling process, and
this process allows for some heat exchange. The tongue is full of
blood vessels close to the surface, and the cooler air hits the blood
vessels and cools the blood that is then sent to the rest of the body.
This process of panting eventually cools the entire body. 
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 209

Some Bulldogs cannot exchange air as fast as other dogs because
of their narrow tracheas and the shape of their noses. When heat-
stroke occurs, they begin to pant more rapidly. This panting may
add stress, which can cause swelling of the throat, making panting
less and less effective as a way for your Bully to cool off.
Bulldogs are cute puppies, and the attention you get when you
take your Bully out in public may be nice, but use common sense
when you care for and travel with your Bully:
 Put some ice cubes in your Bully’s water dish. He’ll enjoy fish-
ing them out, and the ice keeps him cool.
 Give your Bully frozen treats instead of regular dog treats
from time to time. Freeze meat-based broth in ice cube trays,
and pop one out for a treat a couple times a day.
 Never leave your dog outside unattended on a hot day. Your
dog may love to go with you in the car, but if it’s a hot day,
leave him at home. Even with the windows down, a car in
summer can be too hot for a Bulldog.
 During the summer months, carry a squirt bottle of water
with you.
 Invest in a cooling jacket for your Bully.
 Don’t take your Bully to the beach. (You can return his water
wings now.)
 Don’t go jogging with your Bully. You can take your Bully for
walks, and I hope you do, but be aware of his panting and
level of energy.
 Monitor his activity. For instance, if he has a favorite toy, take
it away from him before he gets too warm playing.
If your Bulldog is panting or slobbering excessively, has diarrhea
or is vomiting, or if he’s collapsed, heatstroke can be the cause.
Move your dog to the shade, and soak him with cold water. Give
him small amounts of water to drink. If your dog is unconscious,
get him to the veterinarian immediately.
Eyeballing Eye Problems
Your Bulldog may live his life and never have an eye problem, or he
may have one or more of the following. Knowing what to look for
and taking prompt action with a veterinary visit will help protect
your Bully’s vision and prevent discomfort. 
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
210

Eyelid issues
Eyelid problems are the most common eye problems in almost
every breed, and fortunately, they are the easiest to correct if
caught early. They can be very painful, though, so prompt atten-
tion is necessary.
All those lovely wrinkles that give a Bulldog his special look may
also be the cause of two types of eyelid problems: entropion (the
inward turning of the lower eyelid) and ectropion (the outward
turning of the lower eyelid). Fortunately, both of these conditions
are easily corrected with surgery.
Entropion eyelids
With entropion, the eyelashes rub against the cornea. The cornea
becomes severely irritated or damaged as the chronic abrasion
wears away the corneal surface. In some cases, deep ulcers form in
the cornea, even to the point of rupturing its surface. This damage
quickly leads to inner eye infections and potential blindness. After
diagnosis, surgery is the only treatment.
Several different surgery techniques are available, but typically, a
small incision is made below the lid and a small portion of skin is
removed, and when the two sides of the incision are sutured, the
incision pulls the border of the lid downward into a normal posi-
tion. Antibiotic ointments may be applied if infections are present.
In rare cases, the upper lid can also be affected to some extent.
One or both eyes may be involved. Most dogs with entropion
squint and have a reddened, inflamed eye. Because of the pain
involved, dogs tend to scratch the eye, possibly doing further
damage. Left untreated, severe eye infections may develop.
Ectropion eyelids
Ectropion describes a condition where the lower lids are loose,
causing a drooping of the eyelid’s margins. The lower lids actually
turn outward. With ectropion, part of the inner eyelid is exposed
and can become inflamed. Also, ectropion, if not corrected, can
reduce the amount of tears produced. As the lower lid sags down-
ward, the underlying conjunctiva is exposed. An eyelid pouch
forms, allowing pollens, grasses, dust, and so on to accumulate
and rub against the sensitive conjunctiva — a consistent source of
irritation for your Bully — leading to increased redness of the con-
junctiva and occasional watering of the eye, which then spills out
over the lower lid and face.
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 211

Many Bulldogs live normal lives with ectropion. However, some
develop repeated eye infections due to the collection of air parti-
cles. The risks are minor except in severe cases, where secondary
eye infections may develop. Some Bullies require no treatment;
however, if eye irritations develop, medical attention is advisable.
Mild cases can be treated with eye drops or salves to alleviate irri-
tations and/or infections when they occur. In severe cases, a surgi-
cal procedure is preferred, which removes excess tissue, thereby
tightening the lids and removing the abnormal pocket.
Cherry eye
Cherry eye is a condition in which a gland attached to the third
eyelid — the membrane that covers the eye sideways — gets
inflamed and becomes a red, swollen mass in the inside corner 
of the eye. The cure used to be removing the third eyelid, but
removal frequently led to dry eye, so now, the membrane is 
tacked back into its correct position.
Because of the shape of a Bulldog’s head, only a board-certified
ophthalmologist should perform this surgery.
Dry eye
Dry eye is just what it sounds like. The eye, for whatever reason,
doesn’t produce tears. The condition can lead to blindness if 
not treated, and the treatment is usually eye drops and either
Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus. Some dogs will need eye drops for 
the rest of their lives; some will begin producing their own tears
again, and the drops can be stopped. See Chapter 16 for more
information.
Getting Hip to Hip Dysplasia
Hip dysplasia is the abnormal development of the head of the femur.
Instead of fitting properly in the socket of the hip joint, the femur fits
loosely and may come out of the socket altogether. Considerable
swelling and ruptured ligaments may occur. A dog with hip dysplasia
may develop arthritis in the joints and may also be lame and in pain.
Hip-replacement surgery is an option. In many breeds, breeders
have their dogs x-rayed to determine the quality of the hips. The 
x-rays are studied and given a rating by either the Orthopedic
Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by the University of Pennsylvania
Hip Improvement Program (PennHip).
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
212

Most Bulldog breeders do not x-ray hips, and it is likely that your
Bulldog will have hip dysplasia. Bulldogs hips are generally dys-
plastic on x-rays, but this rarely causes clinical problems for the
dog. The Bulldog’s unique musculature supports the hip in a way
that is not seen in most other breeds. Most rear-leg lameness in
Bulldogs will originate in the knee or stifle, and owners and vets
should not be led astray by the hips’ appearance on x-rays.
Because one of the signs of hip dysplasia can be a rolling gait,
many people believe that this is what gives the Bulldog his distinc-
tive gait. In fact, Bulldogs have such a gait because of their general
build. The wide, heavy front and the narrower, lighter hindquarters
give the Bully his distinctive gait, not badly formed hip joints.
It Hurts When I Sit! Ingrown Tails
If your dog has an ingrown tail, the tail grows backward and down.
This awkward growth creates a deep pocket and can be painful and
infected. If your dog has an ingrown tail, you’ll need to pay special
attention to keeping the area clean and dry. In severe cases, the tail
is amputated.
The tail end of the discussion: The standard for the Bulldog says
that the tail may be either straight or screwed, but breeders dis-
agree and say that the tail should be straight. The reasoning is that
the tail is an extension of the spine. Says one breeder–veterinarian,
“If the tail isn’t wagging, the spine isn’t normal.”
Speaking of Spines: 
Hemi-vertebrae
Hemi-vertebrae are vertebrae that are malformed, looking more
like triangles than blocks. A Bulldog may have malformed verte-
brae and be just fine, but some will start to have trouble walking at
around 5 months old and will eventually not be able to walk at all.
Patellar Luxation
Patellar luxation is the partial or complete dislocation of the
patella, or kneecap. The kneecap normally fits into a groove in the
thigh bone. The kneecap may slip out of the groove because the
Chapter 14: Recognizing and Tackling Bulldog Health Issues 213

groove is malformed, which can be hereditary, or the kneecap may
slip as the result of a fall or a blow to the leg. When the kneecap is
out of the groove, your dog will limp. The kneecap may pop back
into the groove on its own, or your veterinarian may be able to
push it back. Severe cases will require surgery. Left untreated, your
dog can develop osteoarthritis in the joint.

ccidents happen, and you should always be prepared to help
your Bulldog if he needs it. The odds are good that you won’t
need most of the information in this chapter, but think of the facts
as a safety net. (It’s nice to know that the net is there, even if you
never need it, rather than not have it at all.) Discover common
first-aid issues and what supplies you should keep on hand in case
of an emergency.
Your dog may generally be healthy, but any dog can get ill or be
hurt. With time and practice, you’ll soon be able to tell what is a
minor problem that can wait or that you can treat yourself, and
what needs an emergency run to the veterinarian or the nearest
pet hospital. I personally am a member of the better-safe-than-
sorry club, and if there’s any doubt at all, we see our veterinarian.
I’d rather pay for an unnecessary trip to the veterinarian than
make the wrong decision and be sorry.
Your veterinarian isn’t always just treating your dog. With my first
dog, I called the veterinarian much more than I do now. Once, when
I had called after hours, my veterinarian said, “The dog can wait
until morning, but can you?” He understood my concern and was
willing to make the trip to his office to meet me if it would help me. 

I’m better about emergency calls, but I’d rather err on the side of
caution. For instance, if one of my dogs has a touch of diarrhea or
has thrown up once or twice, I may just stop all food for a day and
then feed cooked ground meat and rice for a day or two. The
starch in the rice helps “dry up” the diarrhea, and the diet is bland,
so it doesn’t further irritate the colon. This mixture usually does
the trick, but if the diarrhea continues or vomiting lasts for more
than 24 hours, I head to the veterinarian.
Keeping Your Kit Stocked: 
First-Aid Supplies
Many dog first-aid supplies are the same as human first-aid items,
so one first-aid kit can work for both you and your Bulldog.
Whether you have a separate first-aid kit for your dog or just keep
supplies in a bathroom drawer, you should have some basic items
available for emergencies. If you travel frequently with your dog,
keep a few supplies in your car as well. At first glance, the follow-
ing list looks daunting, but you probably have many of these items
already. They just may not all be in one location. Centralize these
items for your emergency kit:
 Activated charcoal. Give orally if your dog has eaten some-
thing poisonous. The charcoal helps neutralize poison. Don’t
mash up charcoal briquettes — they’re not the same thing.
Check with your pharmacist for the proper kind of charcoal.
 Adhesive tape and vet wrap. Vet wrap is sold in pet-supply
catalogs, or your veterinarian can sell you a roll. The wrap
holds bandages or splints in place and doesn’t stick to your
Bully’s coat.
 Antibiotic ointment. Use for scrapes or cuts.
 Artificial tears. Apply to eyes for eye irritations.
 Benadryl. This drug works for allergic reactions. Give 1 mil-
ligram per pound of body weight of your dog.
 Children’s aspirin. Use for fever or pain. Give 1 tablet per 10
to 15 pounds of body weight.
Use only aspirin for your dog. Do not use ibuprofen or aceta-
minophen. Ibuprofen causes kidney damage and gastric ulcers.
 Cotton balls.
 Gauze. Roll of gauze and various sizes of gauze pads.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
216

 Hemostats and/or tweezers.
 Hydrocortisone ointment. Apply to bug bites or rashes.
 Hydrogen peroxide. Use it to clean and disinfect wounds. It
may also be used to induce vomiting, so if you’ve got a large
bottle of hydrogen peroxide, you can eliminate the syrup of
ipecac.
 Kaopectate. Helps control diarrhea. Give 1 teaspoon per 5
pounds of body weight every 1 to 3 hours.
 Pepto-Bismol. Have your dog ingest to alleviate both vomiting
and diarrhea. Give 1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of body weight
every 4 hours.
 Rubber gloves. Do I need to explain why?
 Scissors.
 Syringes. Stock 3-, 6-, and 12-centimeter syringes for admin-
istering medication. They come in cubic centimeters or 
milliliters.
 Syrup of ipecac. Give by mouth to induce vomiting.
 Thermometer.
 Vet’s phone number. An index card with your veterinarian’s
phone number and the number of your local emergency clinic.
 Veterinary first-aid manual.
If you prefer holistic medications, consider adding these items to
your first-aid kit:
 Aloe vera. Helps relieve pain and itching from hot spots,
insect bites, and other skin irritations. Besides being non-
toxic, should your dog try to lick the aloe off, it also has a
bitter taste, so licking may be discouraged. Licking can slow
healing.
 Arnica gel. Use for sprains and bruises.
 Calendula gel. Apply to scrapes and wounds. Promotes 
healing.
 Cayenne pepper. Apply to the site of bleeding to stop blood
flow.
 Comfrey ointment. Use for minor scrapes and wounds.
Chapter 15: Familiarizing Yourself with Fido First Aid 217

Knowing the First-Aid Basics
Whether your Bulldog gets sick or injured, you should know some
first-aid basics so you are prepared to deal with emergencies as
they arise. Knowing how to take your dog’s temperature, for exam-
ple, and knowing what is a normal temperature can help you deter-
mine whether your dog is ill. Here are some aspects of first aid that
every Bulldog owner should know:
 Your Bully’s normal temperature should range from 100 to 
102 degrees. If the temperature goes above 104 or below 100,
call your veterinarian. Buy a rectal thermometer, and take
your Bulldog’s temperature sometime when you don’t need
to. Don’t be afraid to insert the thermometer; you can’t hurt
anything. Your dog may not like it, but the process won’t 
hurt him.
 Practice taking your dog’s pulse. If you know how, if there’s an
emergency, you’ll know just what to do and will be less apt to
panic. Use the femoral artery on the upper rear leg, where the
leg joins the body. Find the top bone — the femur — of your
dog’s leg. Move your fingers forward, and you should be able
to feel the artery. If you’re not sure or have trouble on your
own, ask your veterinarian to show you during a regular
exam. If your veterinarian helps you, make a note of what is
normal for your dog so you’ll have a number for comparison
in an emergency. The normal pulse rate for a dog is between
80 and 140, and the smaller the dog, the higher the number.
 When a Bulldog is hurt or frightened, he may snap blindly at
any touch, even yours. With many dogs, a simple muzzle
keeps you safe and makes treating your dog easier, but with
Bulldogs, muzzles are not an option. Even if you can put one
on a Bulldog, muzzles restrict breathing (especially if your
Bully is injured).
The best alternative to the muzzle is a common blanket or
newspaper wrapped around your dog. Have the wrapping
extend beyond the dog’s head. This extension keeps your
dog’s jaws away from you but won’t interfere with his 
breathing.
 If your dog’s injuries are severe, transport him on a blanket or
a board, especially if you suspect damage to the spinal cord.
Get help if you can, and try to shift the dog all at once onto
the blanket or board. Call your veterinarian, and give her a
brief description of your dog’s injuries.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
218

 Any injury is scary, and you may want to get to the vet as fast
as you can, but take the time to call the office and let them
know that you’re on the way. You may think that calling the
doctor’s office is a waste of time, but in fact, the phone call
can save time. Your call gives the staff the lead time they may
need to prepare for the emergency, and it lets them know just
what type of problem they may be facing.
Consider taking a course in animal first aid. Many Red Cross
branches offer such courses. Having some basic knowledge can
help you aid your dog until you can get to your veterinarian’s
office. Basic knowledge also helps keep you calm.
In an emergency, panic is a natural response, but you need to stay
calm for the sake of your dog. The voices in your head may be
screaming and telling you to hurry, but resist. Slow down. Take a
moment to think about the best course of action. Improper han-
dling and reactions can result in further injury to your dog. A vet
once told me that the first thing to do in an emergency is take a
deep breath. It’s good advice.
What To Do if Your 
Bulldog Gets Hurt
We don’t always act rationally or competently in an emergency.
Knowing what may happen and the proper way to react can
improve the odds on doing the right thing when our dog gets hurt.
A head wound produces a lot of blood, but the wound itself may 
be superficial, is not the first thing to worry about. A broken bone
can be ugly but won’t necessarily be life threatening. This section
deals with possible problems from the most serious down to “not
so bad.”
Handling injuries from 
auto accidents
Your Bully is not the fastest runner of all the breeds, but occasion-
ally he may get out the front door or get loose from his leash, and
the risk of getting hit by a car exists. You must remain calm in this
emergency situation. Cuts and lacerations can look awful and pro-
duce a lot of blood, but they are likely to be the least life threaten-
ing. Ignore the blood, and focus on what is important.
Chapter 15: Familiarizing Yourself with Fido First Aid 219

Artificial respiration
First, check to make sure that your dog is breathing. If your Bully is
not breathing, you need to start artificial respiration:
1. Extend your dog’s neck.
2. Clear any mucus from his mouth.
3. Pull his tongue forward.
4. Breathe into his nose, closing your mouth tightly over his
nose.
5. Breathe for 3 seconds; rest for two.
6. Continue until your Bully is breathing on his own or until
you get to the hospital.
You can also use the compression method of respiration, but
beware of internal injuries. Place both your hands on your dog’s
side, near the last ribs, and press down. Release quickly. Plan on 12
compressions per minute. If you have help, someone can drive you
to the veterinarian’s office while you continue artificial respiration.
Don’t want to use the compression method of artificial respiration.
Stick with breathing through your dog’s nose.
Circulation
After respiration, consider circulation. Your dog may be in shock.
Shock is usually characterized by loss of blood pressure, dimin-
ished blood circulation, and inadequate blood flow to the tissues.
Your Bully’s breathing can be shallow and irregular, and his pulse
may be fast and faint. Pale gums, lips, and eyelids are signs of
shock.
Your dog may also feel cool to the touch. Check his temperature.
Wrap your Bully carefully in a blanket, jacket, coat, or even news-
papers — anything to keep him warm.
Never use a heat pad or heat lamp to warm your dog, because if
your dog is unconscious, he won’t be able to move away from the
heat if he is too hot. Even if he’s not unconscious, if he’s in shock,
his circulation is poor, and in both cases, the exterior heat source
can cause burns.
Pale lips and gums may also be signs of major blood loss. Look for
external wounds that may need a pressure bandage. If you don’t
have a bandage, use a towel or, if necessary, your hand. Keep your
dog in a horizontal position or elevate the hindquarters slightly.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
220

A tourniquet stops blood flow, but because it does, the tissue
below the tourniquet starts to die. Never use a tourniquet unless
you are certain that without it, your pet will die. Tighten the tourni-
quet only enough to stop the bleeding, and get to the veterinarian
immediately.
If you suspect that your Bulldog has sustained injury to his head,
neck, or back, you must try to stabilize him:
 Try not to move him any more than is absolutely necessary.
 Slide him onto a board, a piece of cardboard, or a blanket.
 Try to move him all at once.
 Use gauze strips to secure your Bully to the board for the trip
to the veterinarian.
Pantyhose work really well if you don’t have a roll of gauze.
Broken bones
Broken bones are likely if your Bully’s been hit by a car. If you think
that your dog has a broken leg, try to splint it to hold it in place.
There are several materials that work well as a splint:
1. Protect the leg with some kind of padding.
2. Use sticks or pieces of wood as your splint.
If wood is not available, roll a newspaper or a magazine
around your dog’s leg.
3. Tie the splint in place with strips of gauze, vet wrap (if
you have it), nylons, or a kneesock.
4. Extend the splint beyond the joints on either side of the
break.
5. If the bone is protruding, don’t try to push it back into
place.
a. Cover the protrusion with gauze.
b. Stabilize the area as well as you can.
6. Get your Bully to the hospital or vet.
If you think that your dog has broken or cracked ribs, bandage
gently to help hold the ribs in place. The operative word is gently.
You don’t want to restrict your dog’s breathing, which may already
be labored.
Chapter 15: Familiarizing Yourself with Fido First Aid 221

Puncture wounds
If there’s a puncture wound or any kind of wound that penetrates
the chest cavity, try to make it airtight. Plastic wrap or even a plas-
tic bag is a good way to seal the area.
If whatever made the wound is still protruding from your Bulldog’s
body, do not remove the object. Leave the foreign body in place,
and let your veterinarian remove it. Pulling the object out can
cause more damage and bleeding. Stabilize the object if you can 
so it doesn’t continue to injure your dog.
Eye injuries
Check your Bulldog’s eyes for signs of injury. Are there surface
cuts or lacerations? If the eyelid is bleeding, use a gauze pad to
gently hold the lid in place, but again, remember to be gentle. Too
much pressure can cause more damage. If you see blood inside
your Bully’s eyeball, proceed directly to a pet hospital or your 
vet’s office.
If your dog’s eye has actually come out of the socket, keep the eye
moist during your trip to the vet. Use artificial tears, contact-lens
fluid, plain water, or cod-liver or olive oil. Apply the liquid every 15
minutes.
Outward signs of injury may not be evident if your Bully gets hit by
a car, but severe internal damage may be a problem. Even if your
dog looks just fine, get to your veterinarian immediately!
Fighting doesn’t solve 
anything, boys!
A dog fight is generally more frightening than dangerous. Everything
you read about fights tells you never to try to get between the dogs
who are fighting, but in real life, people try to stop dog fights all the
time. You can reach in and try to pull the dogs apart, but the odds
are good that you’ll be bitten. In the heat of battle, even your dear,
sweet pet can bite you. Try using different items to break up the
fight:
 A broom or broom handle. Use it to pry the dogs apart
rather than hit them.
 A chair. Again, use it to pry the dogs apart, and try to avoid
hitting them.
 A hose. Squirt the dogs with water.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
222

If the dogs continue to go after each other, if you have help, you
and the other person can each grab the hind legs of a dog and pull
the dogs apart. You’re less apt to get bitten with this technique.
Puncture wounds are the most typical wounds you’ll see from a
dog fight. Clean the wounds with hydrogen peroxide, but don’t
bandage. Check with your veterinarian about getting an antibiotic.
She may want to see your dog, or she may just give you the medi-
cine. Either way, keep an eye on the wounds to make sure that they
don’t get infected.
Dog fights can kill long after the fight is over. Sometimes the fight
that leaves little bleeding is the most dangerous. A dog can suffer
severe bruising and muscle damage without any real lacerations.
Dogs sometimes die of shock or organ failure due to the damaged
tissue’s breaking down and overwhelming the kidneys. Dogs can
become critically ill hours later or even the next day. If the dog
seems ill, depressed, or in pain, go to a vet immediately, or in the
middle of the night, find a pet hospital.
Poisoning
Getting hit by a car is not the only way your Bully can become
injured. Your puppy may like to stick his nose in every corner he
finds, and eventually he may find the wrong corner and eat some-
thing he shouldn’t eat. You need to be ready to act to protect your
Bulldog. The Cheat Sheet in this book contains information on stuff
around the house that can poison your Bulldog, and removing
these things from your home goes a long way toward keeping your
Bully safe.
If you suspect that your Bulldog has been poisoned, don’t wait!
Call your veterinarian, and tell her you’re on the way. If you know
what your Bully ate, take some of it with you.
Signs of poisoning can be single or multiple. Watch for these symp-
toms that may indicate that your dog has been poisoned:
 Abdominal pain
 Diarrhea
 Excessive drool
 Slow breathing
 Vomiting
 Weakness
Chapter 15: Familiarizing Yourself with Fido First Aid 223

If you don’t know what your dog ingested, and your pup has vom-
ited, take a sample of the vomit with you to the vet. If what your
dog ate is a plant or a specific food, you can use hydrogen perox-
ide to make him vomit. Give 1 to 2 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide
every 5 minutes until your dog vomits.

224
Preparing yourself for natural disasters
Depending on where you live, you can experience many different natural disasters:
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, or mudslides. Be prepared to leave your home
for a few days. Follow these tips for preparing for and evacuation your house:
 Keep your dog’s crate fully assembled and ready to go. If you don’t keep a crate
in the car, store your crate where you can easily get it in an emergency. Keep
it by the door or in the carport or garage. Stuff a blanket in it or a few old towels.
 Make sure that your dog has identification on his collar and/or is microchipped.
(See Chapter 6.)
 Keep your dog’s lead handy, or carry a spare in the car. If you’re trying to get out
fast, and you forget the lead by the door, the spare will be important.
 Have a supply of water. Two or three gallon jugs will keep you and your dog for
a day or two.
 Have at least a 3-day supply of your dog’s food in a travel container. Rotate this
food every month, or according to any expiration date on the packaging, so that
it doesn’t spoil.
 Keep a copy of your dog’s vaccination records in the glove box of your car,
including his rabies certificate.
 If your dog is on medication, make sure that you take it with you.
 Make a list of the things that your dog will need should you have to leave your
home quickly. You may not be able to stock everything in the car or near the
door, but a checklist reminds you of the necessities and helps you when you
may be in a panic.
 Think about where your dog can stay if he can’t stay with you. If you have more
dogs than your car holds, or you need to stay in a shelter that won’t allow you
to have your dog with you, where can your dogs go? Make arrangements ahead
of time with a friend or with a boarding kennel. Maybe your breeder will be able
to take care of your Bully. If your local animal shelter is not threatened by the
disaster, you may be able to leave your dogs there.
If the unthinkable happens and you must leave your dog behind, turn him loose.
Don’t shut him in the house with no escape.

Don’t try to make your Bulldog vomit if you don’t know what poi-
soned him or the poison is a caustic product. Many household
cleaners contain ingredients that cause more harm when vomited.
If you find your dog lapping up something he found under the sink,
give him lots of milk or vegetable oil to drink. These products help
dilute caustic substances and also coat the digestive tract until
you can get to the vet’s.
If you’re unable to reach your veterinarian, there are places you
can call for help. The National Poison Control Center of the ASPCA
has two phone numbers in case your Bulldog has been poisoned.
Have your credit card ready. Charges are assessed:
 Call (800) 548-2423. $30 charge.
 Call (900) 680-0000. $20 for the first 5 minutes and $2.95 for
every minute over the first 5. 
Charges are not assessed on follow-up calls for the same case.
Another number is the Pet Poison Helpline at (800) 213-6680. It
charges $35.
Insect stings
We tend to think of poison as something that has been eaten, but
insect and reptile bites and stings are also a type of poison. If you
notice a lump that seems tender or looks like an insect bite, and
your dog is showing any signs of illness, get to your veterinarian’s
office immediately. If your dog’s breathing is affected, give an anti-
histamine, like Benadryl.
Electrocution
This injury poses the most threat when your Bulldog is a puppy
and is always looking for something interesting to chew. If your
dog, at any age, chews through an electrical wire, the possibility 
of electrocution exists.
Follow certain steps to protect your Bully and yourself from fur-
ther harm if your dog has been electrocuted:
1. First, turn off the power, if that’s possible.
2. Use a wooden stick, like a broom or mop handle, to move
your dog away from the source of electricity.
Chapter 15: Familiarizing Yourself with Fido First Aid 225

Do not, under any circumstances, touch the dog while he is
still in contact with the wire. You risk getting electrocuted
yourself.
3. Check for breathing.
4. If your Bully is breathing on his own, get him to your vet-
erinarian quickly.
He may need to be treated for burns around his mouth and
for shock, but one of the biggest threats is fluid buildup in
the lungs, which needs immediate attention.
5. If your dog isn’t breathing, start artificial respiration, as
described earlier in the chapter.
Drowning
Bulldogs may enjoy water for cooling off, but most of them swim
like rocks. If your Bully sinks, get him out of the water, hold him by
the hind legs for about 30 seconds to drain water from his lungs,
and then start artificial respiration.
Keep your Bully on a lead when you’re around bodies of water. If
you have a pool, and it’s fenced, make sure your dog stays on the
side of the fence without the water. If your Bully does have access
to the pool, make sure there are steps or a ramp so that if your
Bully falls in, he can get out on his own. Practice the escape route
with him. If your dog likes the water, get in the water with him, 
and gently guide him to the steps or the ramp. Never leave your
Bulldog in the pool area unattended. It takes only a minute for 
your dog to drown.
Choking
If your dog is choking, use the handle of a screwdriver between his
back teeth to keep his mouth open and to prevent his biting you 
as you check his mouth and throat. He will not take kindly to your
efforts, so if you’ve got someone who can hold the dog for you,
have him do so. If you can reach the obstruction, use your fingers
or a pair of needle-nosed pliers to grab and remove it. If you can’t
reach the problem, try holding your dog by the hind legs and shak-
ing. If that doesn’t work, use the Heimlich maneuver.
1. Make a fist.
2. Apply sudden, forceful pressure to the abdomen at the
edge of the breastbone.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
226

If this doesn’t dislodge the object after two or three tries,
get to your veterinarian immediately. How much time you
have depends on how large the object is and how much air
it is cutting off. 
If you do manage to remove the object, your dog may have
a sore throat for a couple of days, so switch to a soft food
during that time.
Suffering from heatstroke
Yes, heatstroke is discussed in Chapter 14 and throughout other
parts of the book. You are not hallucinating, and that sentence was
not a typographical error. Heatstroke is a real threat to Bulldogs,
and if you’re not reading this book straight through, I don’t want
you to miss this information. Signs of heatstroke include
 Temperature over 106 degrees
 Panting and slobbering excessively
 Vomiting
 Diarrhea
 Collapsing
 Hot and dry skin
 Pale lips
Try to cool down your Bulldog. Move him to a cool, shady area,
and soak him with cold water. Move his legs gently to increase cir-
culation. If he is alert and can drink, give him small amounts of
water. Take his temperature every 15 minutes until it is below 103
degrees and stays there. In advanced stages, get your Bully to your
veterinarian as soon as possible.

Caring for Your 
Senior Bulldog
In This Chapter
 Battling old age
 Feeding sensibly for seniors
 Revising the exercise schedule
 Saying goodbye to your Bully
G
andhi said, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress
can be judged by the way that its animals are treated.” I think
those are valuable words to live by. Think about how you may take
care of your Bulldog as she grows up. Now think about the time,
much farther down the road, when she becomes a senior dog. The
methods of care are completely different.
How do you take care of your Bully when he becomes an elder of
the dog world? Just like people, a senior dog can be active and
happy, but adjustments may need to be made. This chapter covers
all your needs for making your Bulldog’s senior years enjoyable.
Easing Your Bully into 
the Autumn Years
As your Bulldog ages, he may experience some of the same prob-
lems that aging humans face. When your dog reaches his seventh
birthday, add a chemical blood screen test to his annual checkup.
A geriatric profile done early may alert you and your veterinarian
to a problem, and early detection means early treatment and a
better chance to stop, or at least control, a problem.

An older dog may show signs of senility or cognitive dysfunction.
Cognitive dysfunction is a degeneration of the brain and nervous
system and is the equivalent of Alzheimer’s in people. Symptoms
include
 Withdrawing from interaction, and wanting less petting and
attention
 Not recognizing family members
 Sleeping more during the day and less at night
 Staring at walls or into space
 Difficulty learning new commands, and ignoring known 
commands
 Pacing or wandering aimlessly
 Becoming lost in familiar places
 Standing at the hinge side of the door
Talk to your veterinarian about drugs that can help your Bully be
more aware and able to enjoy life more.
Dealing with hearing problems
Your Bulldog’s hearing may not be as acute as it once was. He may
not hear you enter the house when you come home from work, or
he may miss the rattle of his food bowl at dinner. The fact is that
dogs of any breed can have deafness from a variety of causes:
 Drug toxicity: The administration or application of a drug or
chemical that either directly or indirectly destroys cochlear
hair cells, resulting in hearing loss or even total deafness.
 General anesthesia: May cause bilateral deafness from
unknown causes. The body may push blood away from the
cochlea during anesthesia to protect other critical organs, or
pressure or jaw positioning may compress the arterial supply
to the cochlea.
 Noise trauma: Depending on the loudness, noise can produce
temporary or permanent hearing loss. This type of hearing
loss can be prevented in minor ways.
In response to loud sounds, tiny muscles in the middle ear
contract to reduce sound transmission into the inner ear.
However, percussive noise, such as occurs with gunfire 
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
230

and explosions, occurs too rapidly for the reflex to provide
protection. The noise actually disrupts the hair cells and 
their support cells. If a ringing sensation occurs in your ears
while you are with your Bulldog, damage is occurring in the
ears of both you and your dog.
 Otitis: Infections of the middle ear (otitis media) or inner ear
(otitis interna). These infections can produce temporary or
permanent deafness. After the infection ends, the otitis media
may leave behind crud that blocks sound transmission to the
inner ear. Your Bully’s body eventually clears the crud out,
and hearing gradually improves. Otitis interna, if not quickly
treated, produces permanent nerve deafness.
 Presbycusis: Age-related hearing loss that is progressive and
cannot be reversed. Your Bully’s hearing may in fact have
been diminishing over time, but you may have been unaware
because she compensated until she could no longer hear ade-
quately to get by. The onset appears sudden, but the hearing
loss has been progressive.
No matter what the cause of hearing loss in your senior Bully,
make allowances for her diminished hearing. Don’t sneak up on her
and startle her. Some suggestions for compensating for the loss
include
 Stamping on the floor as you approach your dog; the vibra-
tions alert her to your presence.
 Incorporate hand signals into your obedience commands (if
you haven’t already done so). Hand signals help your Bulldog
understand what you want her to do.
 Use a small flashlight, instead of a clicker, to act as a marker
when teaching a new behavior. Use a flashlight that will light
with a push of a button. Flashlights that require moving a
switch will be too slow for training.
 Invest in a vibrator collar. You can use this to train your dog
by making it vibrate when he does something right. Combine
it with hand signals and treats. Or use it to mean “Someone is
calling me.”
Always keep your dog on lead when you’re not in your fenced yard.
Your deaf Bully won’t be able to hear cars or other dogs coming.
Your Bulldog may be old, but you can teach an old dog new tricks.
(That adage just isn’t true.)
Chapter 16: Caring for Your Senior Bulldog 231

Keeping an eye on failing eyesight
Several diseases may cause blindness in a dog. If you suspect your
Bulldog is having sight problems, take him to the vet to see what
treatments are available. Some conditions are quite treatable, so
it’s worth it to investigate them to help save your Bully’s eyesight.
Here are the most common conditions:
 Dry eye, or Keratoconjunctivitis, is common in Bulldogs and is
the result of inadequate tear production. It has the potential
to blind, but it is easy to diagnose and responds favorably to
treatment, which includes “artificial tears” and the drugs
Cyclosporin and Tacrolimus.
 Corneal ulcers are caused by irritation to the eye, trauma to
the eye, or inadequate tear production. Minor ulcers may heal
without complication, but more serious ulcers can cause scar-
ring of the cornea and can even lead to blindness. Signs of an
ulcer including squinting, redness, discharge, and discol-
oration of the eye. 
 A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens. Cataracts give a
cloudy, whitish-blue look to the eye. Your veterinarian will 
tell you whether your dog has a cataract or if the lens has a
bluish look from normal aging, which does not affect vision.
 Glaucoma causes blindness when it produces elevated pres-
sure within the eye. The amount of pressure will determine
how quickly a dog will lose his sight. If the pressure change 
is caught early, medication can lower the pressure temporar-
ily. Long term, only surgery can help, and even the surgery
doesn’t always work.
 Progressive retinal atrophy is an inherited disease, but there
is also a noninherited form called Sudden Acquired Retinal
Degeneration. Both of these cause irreversible blindness and
generally affects dogs between 6 and 8 years of age. Night
vision goes first, and finally, the dog becomes totally blind.
Your Bully’s hearing may remain just fine, but if his eyesight fails,
remember that he still has his nose and his old habits and pat-
terns. If you have lived in the same house for several years, your
Bully knows his way around. Make sure to keep his surroundings
familiar to him:
 Keep the food and water bowls in the same place.
 Try not to wash the dog toys that have your Bully’s scent on
them. (If the plush toys are filthy, you can make an exception.)
 Don’t rearrange the furniture.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
232

 Don’t decide that this is the time to move his bed from one
side of the room to the other.
 Keep the door to the basement shut so your Bully doesn’t
accidentally tumble down the stairs.
 Use squeaky toys or balls with bells in them so your dog can
find them.
 Add textures to the floor. Place a looped throw rug near the
stairs or a sisal mat to mark the door to outside.
 Use scent as a marker. Put a drop of vanilla extract near food
and water bowls. Spritz lavender essential oil at the top of
stairs. Use another scent to mark a door.
Avoid lemon scent unless you want to keep your dog away,
because most dogs don’t like the smell.
You can still take your Bully for walks on a lead along his regular
route, but be alert for anything in your path, like a fallen branch or
a child’s toy, that may cause your dog a problem.
Talk to your dog when you approach him, and remind others to do
the same. Even the gentlest, most loving dog may snap if he’s
frightened by an unexpected touch.
Treating arthritis
Dogs can get arthritis as they age, just as people can. A dose of
aspirin may be all your dog needs to be comfortable, but some-
times he needs more. Rimadyl is the drug most often prescribed
for arthritis and can give wonderful relief to your dog. But Rimadyl
has its drawbacks. If your Bully has current liver problems, he
should not take Rimadyl. Ask your veterinarian to run blood tests
regularly to detect any liver problems as a result of the drug. 
Keep your senior dog comfortable. Always keep your Bully cool,
but now, in his older years, take a closer look at where he sleeps.
Drafts may aggravate stiff muscles and arthritis, so your dog may
feel the cold more. Give him the option of being able to warm up a
bit. A bed made of layers gives your Bulldog the opportunity to
shove aside bedding when he’s hot or to burrow under a towel or
two if he’s cold.
Protect your Bully’s aged joints by adding some padding to his
bed. If he’s always slept on three or four folded towels, put a foam
pad on the bottom.
Chapter 16: Caring for Your Senior Bulldog 233

Adjusting the potty schedule
Sometimes older dogs may have a problem with incontinence,
especially when they’re sleeping. If your dog is incontinent, make
sure that the leaking is not a symptom of something more than just
weakening muscles. A low-grade bladder infection may be the
cause, in which case your veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic.
Your vet may run blood tests or take x-rays to rule out a tumor. If
incontinence is a result of weakening muscles, your veterinarian
can prescribe medications to stop or lessen the problem.
If your dog leaks urine in his sleep, make sure to:
 Add a plastic cover to the foam pad.
 Add a layer of fleece to the bedding. Liquids tend to go
through fleece and keep your Bully dryer.
 Make sure that you wash your dog’s bedding whenever neces-
sary to keep his resting place sanitary.
One way to help alleviate accidents is to make sure that your Bully
goes outside regularly. A schedule of potty breaks three or four
times a day when your dog was younger may not be enough now
that he’s older. If you can, try to let your senior dog out every 4
hours. Everyone benefits from this increased schedule.
Keeping a beautiful smile
Continue to take good care of your dog’s teeth. If there’s an infec-
tion, an older dog may not be able to fight off the disease as easily
as a younger dog. See Chapter 8 for information on Bulldog dental
care.
Feeding a Sensible Senior Diet
As your Bulldog ages, he may slow physically. Even if he seems just
as active, his metabolism may be slowing. As your Bully ages, his
body may not be able to process the food he consumes efficiently.
If you are feeding the regular quantity of food, pay attention to
weight gain or loss. If either drastically occurs, schedule an
appointment with your veterinarian to rule out any major health
problems.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
234

Talk to your veterinarian about the idea of senior food. Senior
foods are formulated to provide fewer calories but still provide
your dog the nutrients he needs.
Some veterinarians recommend specialty foods, such as Canine
k/d by Hills Science Diet and Purina Veterinary Diets NF formula for
the nutritional management of dogs with kidney disease because
these foods are easier on the kidneys. A veterinarian may also rec-
ommend the addition of B vitamins, especially if your dog is urinat-
ing and drinking excessively. The B vitamins are known as energy
vitamins because of their energy-creating traits. B vitamins are
cofactors for a number of important biological processes:
 The breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose, which pro-
vides dogs energy
 The breakdown of fats and proteins, which aids the normal
functioning of the nervous system; muscle tone in the stom-
ach and intestinal tract; and healthy hair, skin, and eyes
 Maintaining a positive environment for neural regenerative
efforts
 Water solubility so excess Vitamin B is eliminated in the urine
If you decide to leave your Bully on his regular food, you may
choose to cut back the amount to bring his weight down or to
maintain your Bully’s current weight. Your Bulldog may notice a
significant cut in his food and wonder where the rest is.
Add canned pumpkin to your Bulldog’s food dish. He’ll love it, and
the fiber makes him feel fuller without adding many calories. Just
remember to use regular canned pumpkin and not canned pump-
kin pie filling.
Exercising Your Older Bully
Bulldogs are not high on the list of canine athletes, but maybe you
practice agility, show your dog, or compete in obedience. Your
Bully may have a touch of arthritis setting in, and moving takes
more effort. Pay attention to your dog’s reactions to various activi-
ties. If he seems stressed or gets tired faster than he used to, cut
back.
You may need to slow down on agility with a senior dog, but you
can continue to attend shows and competitions. Even these events
Chapter 16: Caring for Your Senior Bulldog 235

can put a strain on your senior Bully, so look for signs of fatigue
and stress in your dog. Just the stress of traveling to a show can
take its toll on an older dog. People retire when they get older; it
may be time to retire your Bulldog too.
Retirement shouldn’t mean the end of all physical activity, but
taking a step back may mean that you need to shorten those times
when your Bully is active. Here are some tips to keep your aging
Bully happy:
 Don’t skip dog shows. If your Bulldog loved to travel to dog
shows and competitions, he may miss the traveling, even if he
doesn’t have the stamina for a day at a show. Take him for
shorter trips or to a show close to home. He can compete in
smaller shows or just go to watch.
 Continue to play games. If your dog has always enjoyed a
game of fetch, don’t eliminate the game; just make it shorter.
 Keep moving. Even if your dog has arthritis, moving is impor-
tant. The movement keeps the muscles in shape and alleviates
pain in the long run. If your daily walks have always been
three times around the block, once around may now be all
your Bully can comfortably manage. But at least you and your
dog are still taking the time to walk together.
 Experiment a little. If you have the time, and your normal
routine used to be two walks a day, maybe you can now do
three shorter walks each day.
Exercise doesn’t have a hard-and-fast rule. You need to understand
your own dog and adjust to his needs.
Include your dog in as many activities as possible. Just because he
slows down doesn’t mean he should be isolated. He may need your
love and attention more than ever.
When It’s Time to Say Goodbye
No matter how well you care for your aging Bully, a day comes
when you have to say goodbye. We may wish that when the time
comes for our dog to pass that he would just go quietly in his sleep
to keep him from suffering even more, but unfortunately, that’s not
usually the case.
Most dogs’ lives are ended by euthanasia — that is, the painless
putting to death of your dog by your veterinarian. Deciding when
that should happen is the hardest decision you’ll ever make as a
Part IV: Keeping Your Bulldog Healthy 
236

dog owner. As hard as that decision is, euthanasia may also be the
kindest thing you ever do for your dog. You have the power to end
suffering and pain when there’s no longer any hope. The hard part
is finding the line where no hope exists. You don’t want to wait too
long but always wonder if it is too soon. It is a fine like to walk.
Chapter 16: Caring for Your Senior Bulldog 237
Handling grief
Grief is natural, and grieving over the loss of your Bully is natural too, so stay away
from people who are likely to say, “It was only a dog.” Spend time with people who
understand your loss and sympathize with you.
Grief is an individual emotion and is expressed many ways. Some people heal faster
when they immediately get another dog; others need some time before they can
welcome another canine pal. Some people stick with the same breed of dog; others
want another dog but can’t bear the thought of having the same breed. Don’t let
anyone talk you into anything you’re not ready for. You are the only one who knows
what’s best for you.
Fortunately, in many communities support groups exist that can help you deal with
the loss of a pet and the grief that accompanies that loss. Check with your local
shelter or kennel club. Your YMCA or YWCA may offer sessions too. You may also
talk to a clergyman or a counselor.
Sometimes, writing a letter to the deceased pet helps. The letter can be as short as
“I loved you” or as long as needed. You may want to explain to your pet how you felt
throughout his life or what it was like during the final stages of his illness. Whatever
you write, the words help you deal with your loss.
Other avenues to memorialize your pet include ways to remember and celebrate
your years together:
Memorials
 Memorial marker. This marker can be as plain or as elaborate as you want.
Even if you’ve had your pet cremated or buried elsewhere, a marker in the back-
yard can be a tribute to your dog.
 Plant a tree or flowering shrub. Watching it grow helps you remember the life
of your Bully.
 Make a donation. A friend of mine has donated to the local humane society
whenever I’ve lost a dog, and I like knowing that my friend cares. Most veteri-
nary schools also accept memorial donations.
 Check the Internet. You’ll find memorial sites where you can post your dog’s
picture, along with information about him. A recommended site is The Senior
Dogs Project at www.srdogs.com/Pages/loss.html.

For euthanasia, most veterinarians use an overdose of the anes-
thetic pentobarbital. It is fast and painless.
Other dog owners may tell you that you know when it’s time to let
your dog go — your dog “tells you” when it’s time. Maybe. Maybe
not. I don’t think you always know or that your dog always tells
you, or, if he is telling you, that you always understand. Your
Bully’s life is so short in comparison and we love our dogs so much
that the final goodbye is not always easy to say.

Containers for ashes
 Urns, boxes, and glass pendants. A variety of items exist to preserve your Bully’s
ashes.
 Synthetic gemstones. This jewelry item can be made from your pet’s ashes, and
you can wear the item to remember your Bully every day.
 Stored ashes. Depending on the regulations in your area, you may want your
dog’s ashes buried with you. A friend of mine has left her dog’s ashes with a
funeral home. When she dies, the ashes will be placed in her casket with her.
Other options include lockets with snips of your dog’s hair and the most expensive
option of having your pet freeze-dried. In this process, the dog is posed in whatever
position you have chosen and then is frozen, and the moisture is drawn out in a 
climate-controlled machine. This differs from taxidermy, in which the hide is
stretched over an artificial form. For a Bulldog, the cost will run $3,000 to $5,000.
Making preparations in case 
your Bulldog outlives you
A Bulldog’s life is so much shorter than a human’s that you may never even con-
sider that your Bully could outlive you. Even if you have thought about dog care, you
may just think that your family or friends will take care of your dog, but it’s best to
make sure and to update your plans every year or two. Your best friend may have
agreed to take your dog when she was single, but now that she’s married with two
children, plus a job, the responsibility may not be as practical for her or her house-
hold as it once was. It’s not a bad idea to also have a backup plan.
Several years ago, I had a casual agreement with two other women that if anything
happened to any one of us, the other two would take the dogs and either keep them
or find good second homes for the dogs. Because we all had multiple dogs and homes
and yards that would accommodate these animals, we thought the arrangement was
perfect. Then one summer, we had a car accident, and all three of us were in the car.
(continued)

Talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s condition, and pay
attention to physical signs and to your dog’s quality of life. If you
start to notice the following warning signs, the time has come to
give your Bully the last gift you can give:
 If he no longer enjoys his food
 If he’s in constant pain
 If the bad days outweigh the good
Chapter 16: Caring for Your Senior Bulldog 239
We all survived but realized that our casual plan wasn’t enough. More recently, two
of us have moved to smaller places and wouldn’t be able to keep extra dogs.
My new plan includes a breeder friend who can easily take my two dogs, and I trust
her to do what’s best for my dogs. As a backup, if an emergency occurred, I have
another friend who would take my dogs. She has a different breed, but again, I trust
her to do what’s best.
What’s best depends on the age of the Bulldog and his disposition. A young dog
may go easily to another home, either directly or through a rescue agency. An older
dog with health problems may not be so easy to deal with. If my older male can’t go
back to his breeder to live out his life, I’d want him to be euthanized. No matter how
much we like to think that our older dog will be adopted from a shelter, the cruel
truth is that people want puppies. Take an older dog to a shelter, and he’ll spend his
last days in a shelter run and not in a loving home.
Think about the cost of caring for your dog. Make provisions in your will so that the
friend who gladly takes your dog has the resources to care for your dog as he ages.
Sometimes, our dog is such a part of our life that we forget just how much work is
involved. Make a list of all the special information that pertains to your Bully:
 Allergies.
 Feeding time, including quantity and brand of food.
 Habits. If your Bulldog always curls up with you when you nap, write it down.
 Information about the dog’s general health.
 Likes and dislikes.
 Medications, including vitamins and supplements.
 Rapport with other dogs, cats, or children. If your dog wants to kill the neighbor’s
cat, you should include that in your list.
 Veterinarian’s phone number.
This list also comes in handy during temporary emergencies or as a guide for pet sit-
ters, and if you write everything down when you’re calm and have the time, you
won’t forget something important in the case of an emergency. See Chapter 17 for
more information on resources for caring for your Bully when you can’t.

 If he doesn’t always recognize his friends
 If there’s no way to reverse any of the above
Talk to your veterinarian ahead of time about the procedures of
euthanasia. Your veterinarian may give you the option to stay with
your dog in his last moments. This decision is personal, and don’t
let anyone tell you that one way is better than another. Some
people simply can’t bear to be with their dog at the time of death.
Others are by their Bully’s side until the final breath. I had a friend
who loved and cared for her dogs for generation after generation,
but she just couldn’t be there at the end. I stay with my dogs, offer-
ing whatever comfort I can. If illness hasn’t robbed my dog of his
appetite, I feed him hot dogs just before the needle finds the vein. I
am comforted to have, as a last memory, the image of my dog gulp-
ing down the delicious treats.
Ask about how they dispose of the body. Many veterinarians offer
individual cremation and return the ashes to you if you want. Some
offices have their own crematory; other locations send the bodies
away. If you decide to bury your dog yourself, check your local
health regulations to make sure that you can legally bury your
Bully under his favorite tree.
In the end, where and how your dog is buried is less important
than what you shared while the dog was alive.
“. . . For if the dog be well remembered, if sometimes she leaps
through your dreams actual as in life, eyes kindling, laughing,
begging, it matters not where that dog sleeps. On a hill where the
wind is unrebuked and the trees are roaring, or beside a stream
she knew in puppyhood, or somewhere in the flatness of a pas-
tureland where most exhilarating cattle graze. It is one to a dog,
and all one to you, and nothing is gained and nothing lost — if
memory lives. But there is one best place to bury a dog.
“If you bury her in this spot, she will come to you when you
call — come to you over the grim, dim frontiers of death, and
down the well-remembered path and to your side again. And
though you may call a dozen living dogs to heel, they shall not
growl at her nor resent her coming, for she belongs there.
“People may scoff at you, who see no lightest blade of grass
bend by her footfall, who hear no whimper, people who have
never really had a dog. Smile at them, for you shall know some-
thing that is hidden from them.
“The one best place to bury a good dog is in the heart of her
master. . . .”
Ben Hur Lampman in The Oregonian, 1925

Checking with the Local 
Breed Clubs
Local Bulldog clubs can provide you and your Bulldog lots of
hands-on help, great new friends, and practical advice. Bulldog
breed clubs also give shows and matches for Bulldog fanciers, and
they also often give conformation and obedience classes. The Web
sites of some clubs are listed in other sections of this chapter, and
you can find more through The Bulldog Club of America: www.
thebca.org.
Browsing for Books
For more information of the Bulldog breed, consider reading The
New Complete Bulldog, by Bailey C. Hanes (Howell).
Also recommended are health books for dog owners. These books
are not intended to replace your veterinarian, but to guide you in
understanding canine healthcare and what you can do, with your
veterinarian, to ensure your Bulldog’s good health:
 Pet Care in the New Century: Cutting-Edge Medicine for Dogs and
Cats, by Amy D. Shojai (New American Library)
 The Angell Memorial Animal Hospital Book of Wellness and
Preventive Care for Dogs, by Darlene Arden (McGraw-Hill)
 Pills for Pets: The A to Z Guide to Drugs and Medications for
Your Animal Companion, by Debra Eldredge, DVM (Citadel
Press) 
For training your Bulldog, Dog Training For Dummies (Wiley), by
Jack and Wendy Volhard, is a good basic book that will get you and
your Bully off to a good start.
If you’re interested specifically in clicker-training your Bulldog,
read anything by Karen Pryor. Also, visit her Web site at www.
clickertraining.com/home. This site provides a wealth of
information, from the basics of training to conferences and events
you can attend.

Acquainting Yourself 
with Agility Sources
Do you want your Bulldog to be quick and clever? Well, he’s not
going to be the fastest of all the breeds, but to help with his agility,
check out these helpful resources:
 The United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) promotes
the international standards in dog agility. For the complete
text of the official rules and regulations, visit www.usdaa.
com/rulesReg_eBook.cfm.

Flipping through fabulous dog fiction
There may be a reference or two about Bulldogs in the following books, but they
make great reading no matter what breed is featured. Dog lovers love to read about
dogs, and it doesn’t matter what breed the dogs are. These are some of my favorites:
 Any book by Albert Payson Terhune. Stories about his Sunnybank Collies make
great reading.
 Any book by Susan Conant. Conant writes mysteries featuring a dog writer
named Holly Winter and her two Alaskan Malamutes, Rowdy and Kimi.
 Any book by Carol Benjamin. Her detective, Rachel Alexander, has a pit bull
named Dashiell, as well as various other breeds in each novel, from a
Dachshund in The Long Good Boy to a Puli in Lady Vanishes.
 Virginia Lanier wrote a book series based on trailing with Bloodhounds. Besides
being gripping stories, you can learn about trailing.
 Rita Mae Brown’s mysteries feature a Corgi and a cat.

Pursuing Holistic Medicine
You may pursue holistic medicine for your Bulldog for personal
reasons or for general relief from chronic disease. With holistic
medicine, the possibility exists to reduce medications, which in
turn reduces side effects and improves your pet’s health. 
Acupuncture is one component of holistic medicine. The
International Veterinary Acupuncture Society is a nonprofit organi-
zation with a Web site that can help you find a certified veterinary
acupuncturist in your area. Visit www.ivas.org for an acupunc-
turist directory.
Homeopathy, another part of holistic medicine, is a system of treat-
ing disease based on the administration of small doses of a drug that
in massive amounts would produce symptoms in healthy individuals
similar to those of the disease itself. For further information, you
can visit www.holisticdog.org or www.alternativesfor
animals.com, or contact your local veterinarian’s office.
Rescuing Bulldogs
Hundreds of sources exist in print and on the Internet as references
for rescuing Bulldogs. Every year many Bulldogs are placed in
rescue organizations’ care because their owners have mistreated,
abandoned, or forfeited their right to their pets. If you want to be
part of these kind of organizations or wish to receive your Bulldog
through rescue, try perusing the following Web sites to get the
process started:
 Cascade Bulldog Rescue, www.cascadebulldogrescue.org
 Long Island Bulldog Club, libcrescue.tripod.com
 On the Rebound Bulldog Rescue Foundation, www.onthe
rebound.org
 Smoky Mountains Bulldog Rescue, www.discoveret.org/
smbc/rescue.htm
 The Bulldog Club of America, www.rescuebulldogs.org
Recovering Lost Bulldogs
AKC Companion Animal Recovery (AKC CAR), at www.akccar.org,
gives you information to enroll your Bulldog in its program. AKC
CAR keeps track of your dog’s microchip number, as well as 
Chapter 17: Nine Great Resources for Bulldog Owners 247

information on how to reach you should someone find your dog. All
animals are eligible for enrollment in AKC CAR regardless of identifi-
cation brand or type, or microchip, tattoo, or AKC CAR collar tag.
The AKC CAR database stores close to 3 million enrollment records
and has been used to perform nearly 300,000 recoveries If you have
questions about the program or need to update your records, e-mail
Found@akc.org.
Providing for Your Bulldog 
When You Can’t
A time may come when you are no longer able to care for your
Bully. As sad as that day may be, you owe it to your dog to plan
ahead. Who will take care of your Bulldog in the case of your
death? What will you do if you are physically unable to meet the
daily needs of your dog? Death or losing our capability to take care
of our dogs is not something any of us likes to think about, but
thinking about your future and the future of your Bully is the
responsible method of long-term care.
Many sources are now offering information and help to pet owners
facing this dilemma, offering information about shelters and sanc-
tuaries, as well as explanations of trusts and wills. The Washington
State University Office of Veterinary Medicine and the Kansas State
University College of Veterinary Medicine are only two examples of
places you can contact for more information. Their Web sites can
be found at:

You’re Not Around? (Williams Hill) also provides useful information
on this subject.

Chapter 18
Ten Good Reasons for Not
Breeding Your Bulldog
In This Chapter
 Understanding how breeding changes your dog
 Breeding: A hard road to travel
 Examining the cost of Bulldog breeding
 Preparing for loss
Your Bulldog’s biological clock is not ticking. Having puppies
does not “fulfill” your bitch or “complete” your male. Breeding
may make you feel good and instill a sense of pride in your dog,
but that’s a selfish reason to breed your Bully. And because
Bulldogs are bred artificially, “What’s love got to do with it?” (to
quote Tina Turner). Absolutely nothing! For Bulldogs especially,
breeding comes with a huge set of complications, which are cov-
ered in this chapter. Before you get your heart set on breeding
your Bulldog, please read this chapter.
Assessing the Health Risks 
to Your Bulldog
Male Bulldogs who have not been neutered have a greater chance
for testicular tumors and prostate cancer. Risks of mammary
tumors and ovarian cancer increase in females who remain
unspayed. Females frequently get bladder infections following a
heat cycle. Pyometra, which can be a fatal ailment for female
Bulldogs, is an infection of the uterus, more specifically an accu-
mulation of pus in the uterine cavity. Medical treatment can be
lengthy, expensive, and often unsuccessful. Spaying a bitch with
Pyometra can cost over $1,000. Spaying your puppy, on the other
hand, is closer to $200. Spaying your puppy is an important step in
prevention and will also save you money.

Dealing with Behavior Problems
An intact male may want to mark his territory, which can include
the corner of your sofa or the brand-new pair of shoes you bought
last week. Intact males can be more aggressive when defending
their right to a female in heat. Females in season may be a bit
cranky as well, aggressively attacking other females.
Having to Separate Your Love 
Birds (I Mean Bulldogs)
If you have Bulldogs of both sexes, you may want to board one or
the other of the dogs while the bitch is in season, adding another
price between $200 and $1,000 for at least 3 weeks of boarding
each year.
Tackling the Messier Details
If your bitch is in season, you may want to confine her to one area
with a washable floor instead of letting her have access to the
imported oriental rug. Otherwise, you may be following your Bully
around with a bucket of soap and water to clean up after her. Who
has that much time? One alternative to doggy solitary confinement
include using doggy diapers. Washable diapers run about $20
apiece. Sanitary panties have a place to insert a sanitary pad.
These panties cost between $15 and $20. Pads cost around $5 for
10 or 15, depending on where you shop. Not cheap!
Because of the way Bulldogs are built, they can’t reach to clean
themselves. You have to keep your dog clean. Also keep in mind
that some females can develop an intense hormonal smell (frankly,
they can really reek!). Regular attention to your dog’s hygiene will
help her stench go away.
Testing, Testing, and More Testing
Make sure that your bitch is ready to be bred. Tests need to be
run, above and beyond any health checks that you decide to do,
before breeding. Don’t forget the cost of the actual insemination:
Part V: The Parts of Tens 
250

 Progesterone testing and vaginal smears usually run $80 to
$100 each, with four to six tests needed per breeding.
 Artificial insemination usually costs $100 to $300. This
includes only the insemination process, not the cost of the
actual semen!
It’s the Human Who Becomes the
“Mommy,” Not the Bulldog!
Bulldog puppies are hand raised. Having a bitch with puppies is a
time-consuming process with any breed, but with Bulldogs, the
amount of time is even greater. Say goodbye to your vacation on a
tropical island, because the time off is essential for you to raise
your new puppies. If the bitch has milk, she needs to nurse her
litter, but you need to get up every 2 or 3 hours to put the puppies
on the nipples. Make sure that all the puppies suck properly. Hold
each one, and let the mother clean them after they’ve eaten. If
you’re thinking that you already don’t have enough time for the
process, let alone vacation time, think about hiring someone to
take care of the puppies (add a sitter to your list of costs).
The puppies need to be in a separate box to prevent the mother
from accidentally lying on them. If the mother doesn’t accept them
for nursing and cleaning, you need to do the entire job, from bottle
or tube feeding to using a cotton ball to stimulate them to defecate
and urinate.
Three (Or More) Is a Crowd
Before the puppies were born, you may have thought you had
homes for those puppies, but things can change. Remember, those
puppies are your responsibility. If you can’t find homes for two or
three . . . or four puppies, you must care for them until you do.
That means separate crates, vaccinations, beginning to housetrain
them, and the work of socializing those puppies, not to mention
food and cleanup. 
If you breed your Bulldog, you must be prepared to care for the
puppies you produce!
Chapter 18: Ten Good Reasons for Not Breeding Your Bulldog 251

Bulldog Breeding Is More
Technical than Natural
Bulldogs are rarely ever bred naturally. Breeding occurs com-
pletely through artificial insemination, which is a costly fee. You
also pay to have the semen (fresh, chilled, or frozen) shipped.
Collecting and shipping fees are in addition to whatever stud fees
you’ve agreed upon.
Subjecting Your Dog to 
Cesarean Section
Bulldog puppies are delivered by Cesarean section (C-section) —
another veterinary bill for your files, this time, anywhere from $600
to $2,500, depending on where you live and how complicated the
operation becomes. Also, vets don’t guarantee any live puppies
from a Cesarean section. Either way, you pay.
Adding Up the Bill
This chapter covers a lot about Bulldog breeding that costs a lot of
money, but have you considered how big the bill is when you add
up these costs? These costs can have a real financial impact!
Consider the list, and add away:
 Common health ailments from breeding (including cost for
treatment and removal of tumors):
• Mammary tumors: $300 and up
• Testicular tumors: $350 and up
• Prostate problems: $300 and up
 Spaying ($100 to $200) or neutering ($75 to $150)
 Boarding: $200 to $1,000 twice a year
 Dog supplies (Doggie diapers, milk, cotton balls; the hidden
extras):
• Diapers: $20
• Sanitary pads per season: $25
• Whelping box: $30 to $75, depending on whether you
make it or buy it
Part V: The Parts of Tens 
252

• Hard-sided kiddy wading pool: $5 to $10
• Supplemental puppy formula: $30 for 28-ounce size dry  
• Small nursing bottle with four nipples: $3.50. (Extra nip-
ples: $3.)
• Heating pad or heat lamp: $20 to $30
 Artificial insemination, including office visit, vaginal smear,
progesterone testing: Anywhere from $145 to $250. You usu-
ally do this at least twice, so double those figures.
 Collecting and shipping chilled semen: $180 to $250.
 Surgical implantation, if using frozen semen: $300
 Stud fees: $500 to $1,000 (generally nonrefundable)
 Health checks for breeding:
• Vaginal smears and progesterone testing: $80 to $100 up
to six times
• Physical, including blood work: $65 to $150
 C-section: $600 to $2,500.
Facing the Likelihood 
of Heartbreak
Breeding is not for the faint of heart. You may lose puppies —
some before you get to know them. You work and worry and fuss
over a puppy, and she may die anyway. Sometimes it’s not the
puppy who dies, but the mother. Are you willing to risk losing the
girl you’ve had since she was a puppy? Are you prepared to give
up sloppy kisses and cuddling on the couch? As expensive as pur-
chasing a Bulldog puppy may be, it’s much easier to write  checks
for purchase and spaying or neutering than to breed a litter.
As bad as it is to lose a puppy, losing the mother is heartbreaking,
and that is a danger every time you breed. One breeder, after a par-
ticularly hard whelping, said if she could find the person who told
her breeding was fun, she’d “nail him to a tree.” Another friend,
with a different breed, had a bitch who was just huge with puppies.
As she was talking to her veterinarian on the phone, discussing
having a C-section, because of the size of the coming litter, she
heard a thud. The bitch had dropped dead; the mass of puppies
pressing on her heart had been too much for her.
Chapter 18: Ten Good Reasons for Not Breeding Your Bulldog 253

An intact male that is used at stud is more apt to mark his territory
in the house and more likely to be aggressive toward other males.
There is the risk of testicular tumors and prostate problems. Using
a dog at stud is not like an anonymous sperm bank. Breeders want
a dog that fits the standard, and generally, they want to breed to a
champion. That means spending the time and money to go to
enough shows to earn the points needed to win that title. And
there are still the time and effort needed to collect the semen and
have it chilled or frozen and shipped. 
Good breeders know the danger signs of a bitch in whelp not doing
well. It is very hard-won knowledge. Reputable breeders try to dis-
courage people who just want a pet from breeding for all the above
reasons.

Ten Important Things 
to Do for Your Bulldog
In This Chapter
 Keeping your Bulldog clean
 Making sure that your Bulldog stays healthy
 Improving your Bulldog knowledge
O
f course, there are many things you should do for your
Bulldog to keep him (and you!) healthy and happy, but some-
times it’s easy to fall into habits and forget about some of these
things. This chapter covers ten important things that you should
always remember to do in order to get the best out of your rela-
tionship with your Bulldog.
Cleaning Your Bully’s Collar
It’s not something people think of much, but daily wear can really
dirty a collar, and pet owners tend to forget that fact. Imagine
wearing a shirt or blouse day after day without washing it. Then
imagine the collar. (They don’t call it “ring around the collar” for
nothing.) 
Scrub and clean leather collars with saddle soap, which is usually
sold with shoe-polish products, and nylon collars with hand soap.
A bit of shampoo also works well at cutting the grease, and an old
toothbrush makes a good brush (but don’t put it back in the bath-
room when you’re finished).

Washing the Food and 
Water Dishes
Sometimes food and water dishes get neglected because the food
dish, especially, is licked clean. Put yourself at the dining-room
table, stuffed from the great home cooking. Now imagine each
family member licking his or her plate after dinner and placing the
dish back in the cabinet. Would the plates really be clean? Your
Bulldog doesn’t ask for much. Give him clean dishes. Stainless
steel is the best choice, because ceramic dishes may have lead-
based glaze or paint and plastic dishes may become chew toys.
Freshening Your Bulldog’s Bed
Just like your own bedsheets, dog beds need to be washed. Aside
from dirt from paws and tummy, a bed can harbor fleas and flea
eggs. Remember, don’t overdo the soap because excess soap can
make your Bully itch. A splash of bleach in the wash water helps
kill germs and freshen the bedding.
Vaccinating Your Bulldog
Even if you don’t legally need the shot, as with a rabies shot, there
are preventive vaccines that can help your Bulldog live a longer
life. Talk to your veterinarian about the proper shots for your dog.
For more vaccination information, refer to Chapter 13.
Grooming Your Bulldog
Grooming is fairly easy with a Bulldog. You can even groom while
watching television (you can watch dog shows together). At least
once a week, cleanse all your dog’s wrinkles, and rinse out her
ears. Don’t forget your Bully’s tail, especially if it has a pocket of
skin around the base. A bit of Vaseline in the pocket can help pre-
vent irritation. Refer to Chapter 8 for advice on how to groom your
Bully properly.
Every year, Bulldog rescue groups receive many dogs with severe
infections under the tail. Gently wiping this area helps but doesn’t
prevent all problems. Once again, Vaseline is very good at helping
prevent trouble. It should be applied once or twice a week, more
often if needed, and after every bath.

Chapter 19: Ten Important Things to Do for Your Bulldog 257
Get your vet to recommend a good ear cleaner. Wrinkles can be
kept clean by gently wiping and then immediately applying some
Vaseline. It acts as a moisture barrier and is very safe. Nail trim-
ming is important too!
Exercising Together
You may not run marathons with your Bully (and you have to be
careful she doesn’t overheat), but she does benefit (as will you)
from a brisk walk around the block. Play a game of fetch with her
favorite toy, and think about mental exercise too. Play hide-and-
seek or tag. Hide a toy, and have her find it. Exercising and games
also increase the bond between you and your Bully because it is
valuable time spent one on one.
Balancing Your Bulldog’s Diet
Does your Bulldog need to go on a diet? Is a balanced diet part of
your bully’s routine? Your Bulldog can’t choose his own diet; he
depends on you to feed him what he needs. Table scraps — people
food — may be the worst thing you can give him, even if it’s what
he likes best (which it wouldn’t be if you never started in the first
place). Ask your veterinarian about the ideal weight for your dog.
Pay attention to your Bulldog’s coat and overall condition. The
food you’re feeding him may be perfect, or he may need a change.
Keeping Up to Date on 
Bully Information
If you don’t have a Bulldog, but you’re thinking of getting one, con-
sider the lifestyles of both you and a Bulldog before you get your
Bully. If you already have a Bulldog, read all that you can about the
breed. The more you know, the more you understand about
Bulldog health and about how your pet behaves. If there’s a local
Bulldog club in your area, join. Research is another step to falling
in love with your Bulldog.

Forgiving His Behavior
Forgiveness doesn’t mean giving up on training or not petproofing
your house, but don’t lose your temper if an accident (or two)
happens. Dogs shed. Puppies chew. How important is the dining-
room table leg, really? How much love do you get from the table?
Now think about how much love you receive from your puppy.
You may regard the tooth marks fondly when your Bully is old and
gray. You can have a perfect house, or you can have a Bulldog. I
vote for the Bulldog.
Simply Enjoying Your Bully
Set aside time every day to play with your Bully. Watch the way
she entertains herself, and supply a safe environment and appro-
priate toys. Take your Bulldog (on a leash, of course) to the pet
store with you. Let her explore and pick out a new toy. Remember
why you decided to get her and what a short time you may have
her. With few exceptions, most of us outlive our dogs. Give your
Bully your best, every day.
