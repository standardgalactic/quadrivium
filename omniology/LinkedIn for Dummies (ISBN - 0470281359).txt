Introduction
R
elationships matter. Ever since the dawn of time, when caveman Fred 
asked caveman Barney whether there was any work down at the quarry, 
human beings have always networked. We’re social creatures who like to reach 
out and talk to someone. As the Internet developed and grew in popularity, 
people rapidly took advantage of this new technology for communication, with 
e-mail, instant messaging, personal Web pages sharing voice, video, and data 
with each other, and lots of other applications to keep everybody connected. 
But how can the Internet help you do a better job with your professional net-
working? I’m glad you asked. Welcome to LinkedIn For Dummies.
LinkedIn was founded five years ago by a guy named Reid Hoffman, who felt 
that he could create a better way to handle your professional networking. 
Lots of Web sites let you build your own page and show it to the world, extol-
ling your virtues and talents. But a lot of the popular Web sites focused more 
on the social aspects of your life and not that much on the professional side. 
LinkedIn changed all that with its approach of augmenting all the profes-
sional networking you do (or should do) on a daily basis. You don’t have to 
be looking for a job to use LinkedIn, but if you’re looking, LinkedIn should be 
a part of your search.
In short, LinkedIn allows you to coordinate your professional identity on the 
Internet and make you more effective in your career. The site is designed 
to make the aspects of networking less time-consuming and more powerful, 
so you can open doors with your professional connections and tap the con-
nections of people you know who make up your extended network. LinkedIn 
does not require a huge amount of time or usage to be effective, and is 
focused on only providing tools that help your professional career. 
Perhaps you’ve heard of LinkedIn, but you don’t understand fully what it is, 
how it works, and most importantly, why you should care about it. Maybe 
you got an Invitation to join the LinkedIn Web site. Perhaps you’ve gotten 
multiple Invitations, or you keep hearing about it and want to find out more. 
Well, you’re taking the right first step by reading this book. I talk about the 
Whys as well as the Hows. If you’re looking to enhance your professional life, 
I truly believe you need to look at LinkedIn. If you want to go straight to the 
beach and retire, maybe this isn’t the book for you!
This book covers LinkedIn from start to finish. In case you haven’t already 
joined, I show you how you can sign up. If you’ve already joined, I show you how 
to build your identity and take advantage of LinkedIn’s functionality. This book is 
useful regardless of your skill level, whether you want to join or you’ve been on 
LinkedIn for two years but feel stuck.

LinkedIn For Dummies 
About This Book
This book covers all aspects of using the LinkedIn site: from signing up and 
building your profile, to growing your network of contacts, to taking advan-
tage of some of the sophisticated options, and everything in between. I 
include a lot of advice and discussion of networking concepts, but you also 
find a lot of step-by-step instructions to get things done.
This book is organized as a guide; you can read each chapter one after the 
other or you can go straight to the chapter on the topic you’re interested in. 
After you start using LinkedIn, think of this book as a reference where you 
can find the knowledge nugget you need to know and then be on your merry 
way. Lots of details are cross-referenced, so if you need to look elsewhere in 
the book for more information, you can easily find it.
How This Book Is Organized
I divide this book into six handy parts:
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
This part starts with the basics; I talk about the benefits of LinkedIn, how to 
sign up, and how to build your online profile. 
Part II: Finding Others 
and Getting Connected
Here in Part II, I go a step further and discuss your network of connections. 
I show you how to search LinkedIn’s database of tens of millions of 
professionals, how to introduce yourself to other people, and how to grow 
your own personal network. 
Part III: Growing and Managing 
Your Network
This part starts to heat things up a bit by covering some of LinkedIn’s built-in 
functionality, like getting and receiving Recommendations, adding LinkedIn 
toolbars to your e-mail and Web browser, and importing and exporting your 
network to other applications, such as Microsoft Outlook.

 Introduction
Part IV: Finding Employees, 
Jobs, and Services
Part IV takes everything I cover in the first three parts of the book and 
applies it to the top reasons why people use LinkedIn; namely, searching for 
a job, finding an employee, and finding a reputable service professional. 
Part V: Using LinkedIn 
for Everyday Business
In this part, I continue the trend of showing the real application of LinkedIn 
by applying the site’s capabilities to different professions. I talk about how to 
use LinkedIn for marketing, sales, venture capital and startup, and even some 
creative uses you may have never thought of doing with LinkedIn.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI is the traditional For Dummies Part of Tens — this part contains lists 
that detail a number of LinkedIn functions and resources you can find on the 
Internet to help you with your LinkedIn experience. 
And Just Who Are You?
I assume that you know how to use your computer, at least for the basic 
operations, like checking e-mail, typing up a document, or surfing the great 
big World Wide Web. If you’re worried that you need a Ph.D. in Computer 
Operations to handle LinkedIn, relax. If you can navigate your way through a 
Web site, you can use LinkedIn. 
You may be utterly fresh on the idea of social networking or the specific ins 
and outs of a site like LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to do some really cool 
stuff and enhance your professional life. There’s more to it, and this book 
is here to show you the ropes — and help you take full advantage of what 
LinkedIn has to offer.
This book assumes that you have a computer that can access the Internet; any 
PC or Macintosh line of computer will be fine, as well as Linux or any other 
operating system with a Web browser. All the main Web browsers can access 
LinkedIn just fine. In some parts of the book, I discuss specific applications 
such as Microsoft Outlook; if you have Outlook, I assume you know how to use 
it for the purposes of importing and exporting names from your address book.

LinkedIn For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
As you go through this book, you’ll see the following icons in the margins: 
 
The Tip icon notifies you about something cool, handy, or nifty that I highly 
recommend. For example, “Here’s a quicker way to do the described task the 
next time you have to do it.”
 
Don’t forget! When you see this icon, you can be sure that it points out something 
you should remember, possibly even something I said earlier that I’m repeating 
because it’s very important. For example, “If you are only going to do one of my 
bullet point suggestions, do the last one because it’s the most powerful.”
 
Danger! Ah-oogah! Ah-oogah! When you see the Warning icon, pay careful 
attention to the text. This icon flags something that’s bad or that could cause 
trouble. For example, “While you may be tempted to go into personal details 
in your profile, you should never post anything that could embarrass you in a 
future job interview.”
 
This icon alerts you to something technical that I just cannot suppress the 
urge to share. For example, “It would be as ludicrous for me to recommend 
the 802.11q standard as it would be for me to insist that 1 is a prime number.” 
Feel free to skip over this book’s technical information as you please.

t’s like they say, “You gotta start somewhere.” Well, of 
course you have to start somewhere, where else would 
you be? So, when you’re ready to make that first step, that 
great leap for all of mankind, this is the place you want to 
be. And any other inspirational saying I can squeeze into 
this paragraph. . . . 
This part covers the basics of using the LinkedIn Web site. 
I start with some background on the site and outline all 
the different features covered in this book. Then you 
move into the sign-up phase, where you can create your 
LinkedIn account, and end with building your LinkedIn 
profile, a Web page that details your professional and 
educational experience for all who want to see it — 
depending on who you want to see it, that is.

W
hen I hear the terms social networking and business networking, I 
always go back to one of my favorite phrases: “It’s not what you 
know, it’s who you know.” Now imagine a Web site where both concepts are 
true, where you can demonstrate what you know and see the power of who 
you know. That’s just one way of describing the Web site called LinkedIn, 
one of the top sites today that offers a place for you to do professional net-
working and so much more. Social networking has gotten a lot of attention 
over the years, and the two sites that everyone talks about are MySpace and 
Facebook. Let me state right now, in the first paragraph of the first chapter, 
that LinkedIn is not one of those sites. You can find some elements of similar-
ity, but LinkedIn isn’t the place to promote your garage band’s next concert 
or show pictures of last Friday’s beach bonfire. 
LinkedIn is a place where Relationships Matter. (It’s LinkedIn’s slogan.) When 
you look at the mission statement, LinkedIn’s goal “is to help you be more 
effective in your daily work and open doors to opportunities using the profes-
sional relationships you already have.” This is not a Web site that requires a lot 
of constant work to be effective. It’s designed to work in the background and 
help you reach out to whomever you need while learning and growing yourself. 
The key is to set up your online identity, build your network, and steadily take 
advantage of the opportunities that most affect you or greatly interest you. 
In this chapter, I introduce you to LinkedIn and the basic services it has to 
offer. I answer the question “What is LinkedIn?” and, more importantly, “Why 
should I be using LinkedIn?” I talk about how LinkedIn fits in with the rest of 
your online activities, and then I move into the tangible benefits that LinkedIn 
can provide you, regardless of your profession or career situation. I discuss 

8
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
some of the premium account capabilities that you can pay to use, but rest 
assured, LinkedIn has a lot of features that are free. The last part of the 
chapter covers basic navigation of the LinkedIn site. I show you the different 
menus and navigation bars, which you use throughout this book. 
Discovering Your New Contact 
Management and Networking Toolkit
When describing how people can be connected with each other, think of a 
tangible network. For example, roads connect cities. The Internet connects 
computers. A quilt is a series of connected pieces of fabric. But what about 
the intangible networks? You can describe the relations between members of 
our family by using a family tree metaphor. People now use the term social 
network to describe the intangible connections between them and other 
people, whether they’re friends, co-workers, or acquaintances. 
In the past, people relied on address books or contact organizers (like 
Personal Digital Assistants) to keep track of their social networks. With that 
method, you would grow your social networks by attending networking 
events or by being introduced in person to new contacts, and then you would 
continue to communicate with these new contacts, and eventually the new 
contacts were considered a part of your social network. 
As people began to rely on technology, new tools were created to help 
people manage their social networks. Salespeople especially started using 
contact management systems like ACT! to keep track of their communication 
with various people. Phone calls replaced written letters, and cellular phones 
began to replace regular phones connected to wall jacks, also known as lan-
dline phones. E-mail has replaced phone calls and letters as a quicker way of 
handling communication, and because of the adoption of cell phones, short 
messages known as text messages are being increasingly used to handle short 
bursts of communication. 
Recently, Internet tools have advanced to what people refer to as Web 2.0 
systems, where online communication within your network is much more 
automated and accessible. Sites such as LinkedIn have started to replace the 
older ways of accessing your social network. Instead of asking your friend 
Michael to call his friend Eric to see whether Eric’s friend has a job avail-
able, you can use LinkedIn to see whether Eric’s friend works for a company 
you want to contact, and you can use LinkedIn to send a message through 
Michael to Eric (or in some cases, send a message direct to Eric’s friend) to 
accomplish the same task.

 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
Your collection of friends and other contacts is known as your social net-
work. In the past, you had no way to view other people’s social networks. 
Now, when everyone puts their social networks on a site like LinkedIn, you 
can see your friends’ networks, and their friends’ networks, and suddenly 
hidden opportunities start to become available to you. 
This means you can spend more time doing research on potential opportuni-
ties (like finding a job or a new employee for your business) as well as receiv-
ing information from the larger network and not just your immediate friends. 
This makes the network more useful because you can literally see the map 
that connects you with other people. 
Now, just because this information is more readily available, that doesn’t 
mean there’s no work anymore in networking. You still have to manage your 
connections and use the network to gain more connections or knowledge. 
LinkedIn simply works in the background to guide the way, so you spend 
your time more productively instead of making blind requests and relying 
solely on other people to make something happen. 
Keeping track of your contacts
Does this situation sound familiar to you? You’ve made a connection with 
someone — suppose it’s your roommate from college. It’s graduation day; 
you give him your contact information, he gives you his information, and you 
tell him to keep in touch. As both of you move to different places, start new 
jobs, and live your lives, you eventually lose track of each other, and all your 
contact information grows out of date. How do you find this person again? 
One of the benefits of LinkedIn is that, once you’re connected with someone, 
you always have a live link to that person. When that person changes e-mail 
addresses, you’ll be updated with that person’s new e-mail address. In this 
sense, LinkedIn always keeps you connected with people in your network, 
regardless of how their lives change. LinkedIn shows you a list of your con-
nections, as shown in Figure 1-1. 
The different degrees of 
network connections
In the LinkedIn universe, the word connection specifically means a person 
who is connected to you through the site. The number of connections that 
you have simply means the number of people that are directly connected to 
you in your professional network. 

10
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
Figure 1-1: 
See all 
of your 
connections 
in one 
centralized 
list. 
 
Specifically, though, there are different degrees of how you’re connected with 
people on LinkedIn as follows:
 
 First-degree connections are people that you know personally; they 
have a direct relationship from their account to your account. These 
first-degree connections make up your immediate network and are usu-
ally your past colleagues, classmates, group members, friends, family, 
and close associates. 
 
 Second-degree network members are made up of people who know at 
least one member of your first-degree network connections; in other 
words, the friends of your friends. These are also referred to as second-
degree network members. You can reach any of your second-degree net-
work members by asking your first-degree connection to introduce you 
to his or her friend. 
 
 Third-degree network members are made up of people who know at 
least one of your second-degree network members; in other words, the 
friends of your friends of your friends. They’re also referred to as third-
degree network members. You can reach any of your third-degree net-
work members by asking your friend to pass along an Introduction from 
you to his or her friend, who then passes it to his or her friend, who is 
the third-degree member. 
The result of this is a large chain of connections and network members, with a 
core of trusted friends who help you reach out and tap your friends’ networks 

11
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
and extended networks. If you take the concept of Six Degrees of Separation, 
where there are, on average, a chain of six people that can connect you to 
anyone else on Earth, and put everyone’s network online, you have LinkedIn. 
So, how powerful can these connections be? Let me show you a snapshot of 
someone’s network on LinkedIn, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
 
Figure 1-2: 
Three 
degrees of 
separation 
can give you 
a network of 
millions. 
 
This account has 183 direct first-degree connections. When you add up all the 
network connections that each of these 183 people have, the user could reach 
over 27,300 different people on LinkedIn. When you go one step further and add 
in the third-degree network members, the user of this account could have access 
to almost 2.5 million members, part of a vast professional network that stretches 
across the world into companies and industries of all sizes. Such a network can 
help you (and you can help them) advance your career or professional goals. 
The Things You Can Do with LinkedIn
After you find out about what LinkedIn is, the next step is to find out about 
what kinds of things you can do on LinkedIn. The following sections intro-
duce you to the topics you need to know to get your foot in the LinkedIn door 
and really make the site start working for you.

12
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Build your brand and profile
One of the best ways to think about what you can do on LinkedIn is to rec-
ognize that LinkedIn can help you build your own brand. What do I mean by 
brand? Are you going to create a fancy cursive logo of your name like Coca-
Cola and slap it on everything you own? No. (But hey, that does sound like 
fun if you have absolutely nothing else to do.) What I mean by brand is that 
your name, your identity, is like a brand in terms of what people think of 
when they think of you. It’s your professional reputation. Companies spend 
billions to ensure you have a certain opinion of their products, and that opin-
ion, that perception, is their brand image. You have your own brand image 
The difference between 
a user and a LION
Given all this power and potential to reach 
people around the world, some people want 
to network with anyone and everyone who’s 
eager to connect with them. These people are 
known as LinkedIn open networkers, or LIONs 
for short. Their goal is to network with as many 
people as possible, regardless of past interac-
tion or communication with that person. 
One of your most prominently displayed 
LinkedIn statistics is the number of first-degree 
connections that you have. After you surpass 
500 connections, LinkedIn doesn’t display your 
current count of first-degree connections, but 
rather it displays the message 500+. (It’s kind 
of like how McDonald’s stopped displaying the 
running total of hamburgers sold on their signs. 
Or am I the only one who remembers that?) Part 
of the reason LinkedIn stops displaying updated 
counts past 500 is to discourage people from 
collecting connections. Many LinkedIn LIONs 
have thousands or even tens of thousands of 
first-degree connections, and the 500+ statistic 
is a badge of honor to them. 
LIONs encourage open networking (that is, the 
ability to connect with someone you have never 
met or worked with in the past) by advertising 
their e-mail address as part of their profes-
sional headline, so anyone can request this 
person to be added to their network. You can 
find more information at sites such as www.
mylink500.com.
LinkedIn offers a formal program for people 
who are interested in networking with the 
larger community. It is called OpenLink, and it’s 
a premium service you can sign up for at any 
time after you establish a premium account. 
When you enable the OpenLink feature, it 
allows you to send and receive messages with 
any other OpenLink member. I discuss this later 
in the chapter in the section “Understanding 
LinkedIn’s Costs and Benefits.” 
I’ve been asked the following question many 
times: Is it okay to be a LION? Is there any mean-
ing or benefit to having so many connections? 
The answer is: It depends. Some people use 
their high number of connections to get their 
name out so they can meet as many people as 
possible and find some quality hidden in the 
quantity. Other people just like to collect con-
nections like they collect friends on MySpace; 
perhaps they see it as a popularity contest. 
Most people stick to using LinkedIn to cultivate 
the real quality connections they have, and they 
add a person to their network only after they get 
to know the person. 

13
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
in your professional life, and it’s up to you to own your brand, define your 
brand, and push your brand. 
Most people today have different online representations of their personal 
brand. Some people have built their own Web sites, others have created and 
written their own blogs, and some others have created profile pages on sites 
like MySpace and Facebook. LinkedIn allows you to define a profile and build 
your own brand based on your professional and educational background; I 
use my profile as an example in Figure 1-3. 
 
Figure 1-3: 
Create a 
unified 
profile page 
that details 
your entire 
professional 
history.
 
Your LinkedIn profile can become your jumping-off point where any visitor 
can get a rich and detailed idea of all the skills, experiences, and interests 
that you bring to the table. Unlike a resume, where you have to worry about 
page length and formatting, you can detail as much as you want on your 
LinkedIn profile, including any part-time, contract, non-profit, and consulting 
work in addition to traditional professional experience. You also have other 
options to consider. You can . . .
 
 Write your own summary.
 
 List any groups you belong to.
 
 Show any memberships or affiliations you have.
 
 Cite honors and awards you have received.

14
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
 Give and receive Recommendations from other people.
 
 Indicate your professional interests.
 
 Post Web site links to other parts of your professional identity, like a 
blog, a Web site, or an e-commerce store you operate. 
The best part is that this is your professional identity and you control and 
shape it, not other people. You decide what the content should be. You decide 
what you emphasize and omit. You can decide how much of this information is 
visible to the world and how much is visible to your first-degree network con-
nections. (I talk more about the power of your profile in Chapter 3.) 
Looking for jobs now and later
Face it: At some point in your life, you’ll probably have to look for a job. It 
may be today, it may be a year from now, it may be ten years from now. The 
job search is, in itself, a full-time job, and study after study shows that 60 to 
80 percent of all jobs are found not through a job board like Monster.com, 
not through a newspaper classified ad, but rather by a formal or informal net-
work of contacts where the job isn’t even posted yet. LinkedIn makes it easier 
than before to do some of the following tedious job search tasks: 
 
 Finding the right person at a target company, like a hiring manager in a 
certain department, to discuss immediate and future job openings
 
 Getting a reference from a past boss or co-worker to use for a future job 
application
 
 Finding information about a company and position before the interview
 
 Searching posted job listings on a job board like LinkedIn’s job board
The hidden power of LinkedIn is that it helps you find jobs you weren’t 
looking for or applying to directly. This is when you’re a passive job seeker, 
currently employed but interested in the right opportunity. Currently, over 
130,000 recruiters are members of LinkedIn, constantly using the search func-
tions to go through the database and find skilled members that match their 
job search requirements. Instead of companies paying big money for resume 
books, they now have instant access to tens of millions of qualified profes-
sionals, each of which has a detailed profile with skills, experience, and rec-
ommendations already available. 
This practice of finding passive job seekers is growing quickly on LinkedIn, 
mainly because of the following reasons:
 
 Companies can run detailed searches to find the absolute perfect can-
didate with all the right keywords and skills in his or her profile, and 
they then contact the person to see whether he or she is interested.

15
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
 
 LinkedIn users demonstrate their capabilities by answering other 
people’s questions on the site, which gives companies insight into the 
passive job seeker’s capabilities. 
 
 Companies can review a person’s profile to do reference checks ahead 
of time and interview only people they feel would be a great match with 
their corporate culture. 
 
 Currently employed individuals can quietly run their own searches at 
any time to see what’s available, and they can follow up online without 
taking off a day for an in-person or phone interview. 
 
LinkedIn’s research shows that “People with more than 20 connections are 34 
times more likely to be approached with a job opportunity than people with 
less than 5 connections.” Therefore, your connections definitely influence 
your active or passive job search. 
Finding out all kinds of 
valuable information
You can use LinkedIn to find out more than just information about your job 
search. You can use this immense database of professionals to find out what 
skills seem to be the most popular within a certain industry and job title. 
You can learn how many project managers live within 50 miles of you. You 
can really learn more by finding past employees of a company and interview-
ing them about their previous job. LinkedIn now has thousands of detailed 
Company Profiles that not only show company statistics, but recent hires, pro-
motions, changes, and lists of employees that are closely connected with you. 
Imagine if you could pick the brains of tens of millions of professionals 
around the world about almost any topic. Well, now you can, using a system 
called LinkedIn Answers. With LinkedIn Answers, you can post a question 
about a certain topic, mostly business- or LinkedIn-related. Other LinkedIn 
members can browse the questions and write up free responses — from the 
one-line response to the three-page essay — to share their thoughts and 
answer your question the best they can. There’s no think-tank to pay, no 
pre-qualifications or lag time in your data gathering. Typically, you start to 
see people responding within one to two business days. I talk more about 
LinkedIn Answers in Chapter 7. 
Best of all, LinkedIn can help you find specific information on a variety of 
topics. You can do a search to find out the interests of your next sales pros-
pect, the name of a former employee you can talk to about a company you 
like, or how you can join a start-up in your target industry by reaching out to 
the co-founder. You can sit back and skim the news, or you can dive in and 
hunt for the right facts. It all depends on what method best fits your goals. 

16
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Expand your network
You have your network today, but what about the future? Whether you want 
to move up in your industry, look for a new job, start your own company, or 
achieve some other goal, one way to achieve these goals is to expand your 
network. LinkedIn provides a fertile ground to reach like-minded and well-
connected professionals who share a common interest, experience, or group 
membership. The site also provides several online mechanisms to reduce the 
friction of communication, so you can spend more time building your net-
work instead of searching for the right person. 
First and foremost, LinkedIn lets you identify and contact members of other 
people’s professional networks, and best of all, you don’t have to contact 
them via a cold call, but with your friend’s Recommendation or Introduction. 
In addition, you can find out more about your new contact before you send 
the first message, so you don’t have to waste time figuring out whether this is 
someone who could be beneficial to have in your network. 
You can also meet new people through various groups on LinkedIn, whether 
it’s an alumni group from your old school, a group of past employees from the 
same company, or a group of people interested in improving their public speak-
ing skills and contacts. LinkedIn Groups are ways for you to identify with other 
like-minded members, search for specific group members, and share information 
about the Group with each other. I cover LinkedIn Groups in Chapter 14. 
Understanding LinkedIn’s 
Costs and Benefits
Signing up for LinkedIn is free, and many of the functions are open to all account 
holders, so you can take advantage of most of the opportunities that LinkedIn 
can create. You don’t have to pay a setup or registration fee, but you can pay a 
monthly fee for a premium account in order to get additional functions or com-
munication options. Finally, tailored solutions are available for corporations that 
want to use LinkedIn as a source for hiring quality candidates. 
Free versus paid accounts
So, what’s the difference between a free account and paid account on LinkedIn? 
The answer is not much. The basic account is anything but basic in usage. 
Your free account with LinkedIn allows you to use most of LinkedIn’s most 
popular features, including

17
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
 
 Build a network of connections with no limits on size or numbers. 
 
 Reconnect with any member of the LinkedIn network, provided he or 
she knows you.
 
 Create a professional and detailed LinkedIn profile on the Web. 
 
 Give and receive an unlimited number of Recommendations. 
 
 Post up to ten questions and answer an unlimited amount of questions 
on LinkedIn Answers. 
 
 Join or create a large number of LinkedIn Groups. 
 
 Request up to five Introductions at one time. (After someone accepts an 
Introduction, you can request a new Introduction in its place.)
 
 Perform an unlimited number of searches for LinkedIn members in your 
extended network. 
If you want to step up to a paid account, some of the main features include
 
 Sending a message to anyone in the LinkedIn community — regardless 
of whether he or she is in your extended network — through an InMail 
messaging service.
 
 Sending more Introductions out at any one given time than the basic 
account allows. 
 
 Viewing more full profiles of people in your extended search results.
 
 Seeing more LinkedIn network profiles in your extended search results.
 
 Performing a Reference Search on someone.
 
 Membership in the OpenLink program and unlimited OpenLink mes-
sages. (See the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter, “The difference 
between a user and a LION.”)
 
 Premium customer service channels with guaranteed response times. 
Comparing the paid accounts
Currently, LinkedIn offers a few levels of paid accounts, each with a specific 
level of benefits as mentioned previously. For the most up-to-date packages 
that LinkedIn offers, check out the following LinkedIn page, which looks like 
Figure 1-4:

features on 
LinkedIn.
 
Every premium account comes with certain benefits regardless of the level 
you choose. These benefits include
 
 Unlimited one-click reference searches
 
 OpenLink network membership
 
 Unlimited OpenLink messages
 
 Premium access content
 
 One-business-day customer service
As of this writing, LinkedIn offers three premium packages targeted at indi-
vidual users, the Business, Business Plus, and Pro accounts. Each account 
level comes with a specific level of benefits: 
 
 Business accounts cost $19.95 per month or $199.50 per year. This 
account includes
 
• Three InMails per month, with a seven-day response guarantee 
(Unused InMail credits roll over each month, up to a maximum of 9 
credits. I discuss InMail specifically in Chapter 5.)
 
• Expanded Profile views for the top 100 search results outside your 
network
 
• Fifteen Introductions open at a time

19
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
 
 Business Plus accounts cost $50 per month or $500 per year. This 
account includes 
 
• Ten InMails per month, with a seven-day response guarantee 
(Unused InMail credits roll over each month, up to a maximum of 
30 credits. See Chapter 5 for more on InMail.)
 
• Expanded profile views for the top 150 search results outside your 
network
 
• Twenty-five Introductions open at a time
 
 Pro accounts cost $200 per month. This account includes 
 
• Ten InMails per month, with a seven-day response guarantee 
(Unused InMail credits roll over each month, up to a maximum of 
30 credits. I discuss InMail in detail in Chapter 5.)
 
• Expanded profile views for the top 200 search results outside your 
network
 
• Forty Introductions open at a time
How do I upgrade to a premium account?
I highly recommend starting out by creating your free account and using the 
various functions on LinkedIn. If you find that after some usage you need 
to reach the larger community and take advantage of some of the premium 
account features, you can always upgrade your account and keep all of your 
profile and network information that you previously defined. 
If you’re in charge of human resource functions at a small, medium, or large 
company and you are interested in using the Corporate Solutions functions 
for your company, do not follow the steps in this section. Instead, visit the 
following URL for more information: 
www.linkedin.com/static?key=corporate_landing
To subscribe to a premium account, just follow these steps:
 
1. You must have created a LinkedIn account already (see Chapter 2). Click 
the Account & Settings link near the top-right corner of the home page. 
 
 You see your Account & Settings page, like in Figure 1-5. 
 
2. Click the yellow Upgrade button from the Account section to bring up 
the premium account options, as shown in Figure 1-6.
 
3. Select the radio button for the premium level that you want to 
upgrade to for your account. Click the Continue button to go to the 
Billing Information screen, like the one shown in Figure 1-7.

4. Fill in the appropriate billing information in the boxes provided. 
 
 LinkedIn accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover to 
pay for your premium account. Make sure the billing address you pro-
vide matches the credit card billing address on file.
 
5. Select the check box to agree to automatic billing every month 
and LinkedIn’s Terms and Conditions. Click the Buy Now button to 
upgrade your account. 
That’s it! LinkedIn will pro-rate your first month’s charge based on how many 
days were left in the billing cycle, and it will automatically charge your credit 
card each month afterwards for the full amount, unless you bought a yearly 
plan, for which the charges renew every 12 months.

Navigating around LinkedIn
When you’re ready to get started, you can sign up for an account by checking 
out Chapter 2. Before you do, however, take a look at the following sections, 
which walk you through the different parts of LinkedIn’s Web site so you 
know how to find all the cool features I discuss in this book. 

22
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
After you’ve logged on to your LinkedIn account, you see the LinkedIn home 
page (www.linkedin.com), as shown in Figure 1-8. There are three impor-
tant areas on your LinkedIn home page, which you’ll use a lot, and I cover 
those areas in the following sections. 
 
Figure 1-8:

The top navigation bar
Every page on LinkedIn contains certain links to the major parts of the site, 
and I call this top set of links the top navigation bar throughout this book. As 
of this writing, the four major parts of the top navigation bar are
 
 People: Links to the different searches you can do on LinkedIn.
 
 Jobs: Links to the different job searches and postings you can do on 
LinkedIn.
 
 Answers: Links to the different pages within LinkedIn Answers.
 
 Companies: Links to a company or service provider search on LinkedIn.

23
 Chapter 1: Looking into LinkedIn
When you click the drop-down arrow next to any of these words, you can 
see the various options within each section, like the People search shown in 
Figure 1-9. 
 
Figure 1-9:

drop-down 
arrow to see

each

Click to expand menu of options
If you simply click the word, like People or Jobs, you’re taken to the home page 
for that section of the Web site. You can also click the Advanced Search link to 
the right of the top navigation bar to bring up an Advanced People Search.
The left navigation menu
I call the menu of choices along the left side of the screen the left navigation 
menu throughout this book, and this menu helps you go straight to your 
various pages within LinkedIn. 
When you first create your account, you may notice that none of the menu 
options are expanded, and it looks something like Figure 1-10. I recommend 
that you expand each menu section by clicking the + sign next to each sec-
tion header so your menu looks more like Figure 1-11 below and you can 
access most of your functions with one click.

The Account & Settings page
If you ever need to update any aspect of your LinkedIn account, you can do 
so by accessing the Account & Settings page. You can always find a link to 
this page at the top right of any page within LinkedIn. 
When you click that link, you see the Account & Settings page within 
LinkedIn, as shown in Figure 1-12. You first see the settings for your particu-
lar account level, especially if you chose a premium account. 
Scroll down, however, and you see all the different settings you can update 
for your LinkedIn account, as shown in Figure 1-13. 
The categories you can access from this page are
 
 Profile Settings: Here, you can update any part of your profile, add 
a profile photo, change your status and public profile settings, and 
manage your Recommendations. 
 
 Personal Information: Here, you can update the personal informa-
tion that LinkedIn has on file for you, including Name, Location, E-mail 
addresses, and passwords.

 Email Notifications: Here, you set how you receive various commu-
nications from other LinkedIn members, like Introductions, InMail, 
Invitations to Connect, and OpenLink messages, if applicable. 
 
 Privacy Settings: Here, you decide how much of your profile is acces-
sible by your contacts, and how much information you want to make 
available to your network in terms of profile or status updates. 
 
 Home Page Settings: Here, you decide how Network Updates and News 
articles are displayed on your LinkedIn home page. 
 
 RSS Settings: Here, you decide whether you want to enable something 
called an RSS feed, which is a collection of any updates you make to your 
profile that you can subscribe to and read without visiting LinkedIn. 
 
 Groups: Here, you can update your settings for your memberships with 
different LinkedIn Groups. You won’t see this category until you join at 
least one group. 
 
 My Network: Here, you can update settings that will tell LinkedIn how you 
plan to use the site. LinkedIn will then use this information to customize the 
messages you see when using the site to help fit with your stated goals.

 Registering and setting your preferences
 Deciding how to use LinkedIn
 Connecting with people you already know on LinkedIn
W
hen LinkedIn first launched, it grew primarily through invitations — 
you would join only if someone who was already a member invited 
you and encouraged you to join. Membership is open to anyone 18 years 
or over (as long as the user hasn’t previously been suspended or removed 
from LinkedIn, of course). You can have only one active account, but you can 
attach multiple e-mail addresses, past and present, to your account so that 
people can more easily find you. 
You will be presented with some configuration settings during the signup 
process that you may not know what to do with until you get more familiar 
with the system. Fortunately, you can customize all of those settings at a 
later time, but for now I suggest some initial settings. In addition, based on 
your initial settings, LinkedIn will recommend people to invite to your net-
work. I discuss the ways you can grow your network more extensively in 
Chapter 6, but this chapter touches on the initial Recommendation process. 
Joining LinkedIn
Many people join LinkedIn because a friend or colleague invited them. You 
can join just as easily without receiving an invitation. Everyone joins at the 
basic level, which is free (there are several levels of paid membership). That 
makes the signup process quite straightforward.

28
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Joining with an invitation
When a friend or colleague invites you to join, you will receive an e-mail 
invitation. The e-mail will clearly identify the sender and have the words 
“Invitation to connect on LinkedIn,” or a custom header that the sender 
wrote, that will hopefully have the word LinkedIn in the subject. 
When you open the message, you see an invitation to join LinkedIn, like the 
message in Figure 2-1. There may be some extra text if the person inviting 
you has personalized the message. You’ll also see a link that takes you back 
to LinkedIn to create your account. Simply click that link to start the process.
From here, your next step is to register, which is covered in the section 
“Registering with LinkedIn” a little later in this chapter. 
 
Figure 2-1:

29
 Chapter 2: Sign Me Up!
Joining without an invitation
If you haven’t gotten an invitation, don’t let that turn you into a wallflower. 
You can join LinkedIn directly, without an invitation from an existing user. 
Open Internet Explorer, Firefox, or another Web browser and make your way 
to www.linkedin.com.You see the initial LinkedIn homepage, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. It has a special link, “What is LinkedIn?” in the top-right corner, if 
you would like to read more information about LinkedIn. You simply need to 
provide your first name, last name, and your e-mail address, then click the 
Continue button to start the registration process. I cover the specifics of reg-
istration in the next section. 
 
Figure 2-2: 
The 
LinkedIn 
home page. 
 
Registering with LinkedIn
The Registration page might vary in appearance, depending on whether you’re 
signing up with or without an invitation, but the registration process is the 
same. On the Join LinkedIn page, which you can see in Figure 2-3, LinkedIn 
needs to collect some basic information about you to create your account.

30
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
Figure 2-3: 
Tell LinkedIn 
a little about 
yourself so 
they can 
create your 
account!
 
Specifically, you need to provide the following information:
 
 Your first name, last name, and e-mail address. LinkedIn fills in this 
information, either from the invitation you received or the text you 
entered when you went to the home page.
 
 A password for your LinkedIn account. Your password needs to be at 
least 6 characters long, and should not be something another person 
could easily guess.
 
 Your country and postal code. LinkedIn will not display your ZIP code, 
but will use it to assign a Region to your profile, so others know the gen-
eral area where you reside.
 
 Your current employment status. Click the drop-down box to indicate if 
you are employed, self-employed, looking for work, or a student.
 
 Details about your status. Depending on your status, LinkedIn will either 
ask for a Company, Job Title, and Industry if you are employed, or ask 
for Industry focus if you are looking for work, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
If you find it hard to choose an industry that best describes your primary 
expertise, just choose one that’s closest — you can always change the selec-
tion later.

31
 Chapter 2: Sign Me Up!
 
Figure 2-4: 
Depending 
on your 
work status, 
LinkedIn 
may ask a 
few less 
questions. 
 
Once you have completed the Join LinkedIn form, click the blue Join LinkedIn 
button to create your account. 
If you’re joining with an invitation, the Registration page will have a few slight 
differences, as shown in Figure 2-5:
 
 The top line of the screen includes the name of the person who 
invited you.
 
 You will see a right sidebar that includes some information about the 
network of the person who invited you, like their professional headline 
and their number of first-degree connections.
 
 Your name and e-mail address are displayed in the form based on what 
the inviter entered for you. Feel free to change it as you see fit. 
 
If you want to be known on LinkedIn by another version of your name (say 
a nickname, maiden name, or proper name), or if you want to use a different 
e-mail address, you can change the details now in those fields — First Name, 
Last Name, E-mail.
Currently, when you click the Join button to create your LinkedIn account, 
LinkedIn states that by clicking the button, you are indicating that you have 
read, understood, and agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement and Privacy 
Policy. These are important documents, especially the sections of the User 

32
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Agreement on Termination (of your LinkedIn account) and User Conduct. 
The Privacy Policy contains important information about how LinkedIn will 
manage the information you provide and your activity online. You can read 
the documents online or print them out — each document prints out to 
about four pages of text. The User Agreement is also known as the Terms of 
Use. Simply click the links for User Agreement and Privacy Policy below the 
Join button, as indicated in Figure 2-6.

Before you click the Join button, double-check that you completed the 
required fields. Leaving any of the required fields empty or not choosing an 
industry in the Industry field returns an error message. 
Deciding how you want to use LinkedIn
After you complete the registration and click the Join LinkedIn button, the 
LinkedIn: Contact Settings page asks you how you want to use LinkedIn, as 
shown in Figure 2-7. 
You are asked to choose some options for the following:
 
 What you want the LinkedIn network to help you find
 
 What kinds of things you want to be contacted about via LinkedIn
The choices you make regarding how you want to be found will become what 
LinkedIn calls your Contact Settings. They help visitors to your LinkedIn 
Profile page understand your preferences for contact.
Notice that some of the check box items are already selected. These selec-
tions were made based on what you provided for your employment status on 
the Join page, under the “I am currently…” option. Make sure the selections 
are the ones you want. You may want to uncheck some that have already 
been selected and select some of the ones that aren’t yet selected.
The selections you make are displayed on your LinkedIn Profile page. See 
Chapter 3 for suggestions on how to make the best use of your Profile page. 
Just for now, understand that:
 
 Your selection of items on this page determines the kinds of contact you 
have with other LinkedIn users.
 
 You can change your selections at any time and as often as you want. 
An obvious example of what I’m talking about here is that if you’re looking 
for a job, it clearly makes sense to select the Finding a Job option. That way 
any people who visit your profile can see you’re on the hunt, and they would 
be able to tell that you’d welcome messages regarding job opportunities. If 
you aren’t seeking a job, you don’t want to receive messages about available 
jobs, and you’d want to leave the Finding a Job option deselected. As another 
example, in the To Be Found section, if you select the check box that indi-
cates you want to be contacted about “Relevant requests for expertise about 
industries, products or companies,” you need to be ready to welcome such 
requests.

34
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
For now, just select the check boxes for the items that seem to meet your 
needs. If in doubt, select less rather than more. When you’ve made your 
selections, press the Save Settings button.

Finishing the LinkedIn registration process
If someone invited you to join LinkedIn, the Build Your Network page 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-8. This page provides some information and 
invites you to take several actions. LinkedIn informs you that your account 
has been created and the person who invited you is your first connection 
in your network. Additionally, it asks you to identify any people you con-
sider trusted contacts, so LinkedIn can send them an invitation to join your 
account. Fill out the name and e-mail address fields if you think of people you 
want to invite immediately, and then click the Send invitations button. (I dis-
cuss how to grow your network in Chapter 6.) If you want to wait on sending 
out any invitations, click the small link marked Skip this step in the bottom-
right corner of the screen.

Send Invitations button
If you joined LinkedIn without an invitation, you will be taken to your new 
LinkedIn home page, as shown in Figure 2-9. First, at the top of the page, you 
can see a line of text that states your basic Contact Settings have been saved. 
In other words, the selections you just made on the previous page with the 
check boxes have now been incorporated into the online profile that LinkedIn 
is helping you build.
Privacy confidential
Keep in mind that when you provide LinkedIn 
with access to your existing contact lists, such 
as on Gmail or your Yahoo! mail, rest assured 
that LinkedIn respects your privacy.
LinkedIn is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy 
Program. In its Privacy Policy, LinkedIn 
declares its adherence to the following key 
privacy principles:
  LinkedIn will never rent or sell your person-
ally identifiable information to third parties 
for marketing purposes.
  LinkedIn will never share your contact 
information with another user, without your 
consent.
  Any sensitive information that you provide 
will be secured with all industry standard 
protocols and technology.

Figure 2-9:

Next, you are asked to check your e-mail for a confirmation message. Then, 
under the instruction to check your e-mail is the heading Build Your Network, 
with various options or tools. The practical thing to do first, before you start 
on the Build Your Network section, is to follow the instruction to check your 
e-mail for confirmation. This requires some action on your part before you 
return to the Build Your Network phase.
 
If you skip the step of confirming your e-mail with LinkedIn, you will be unable 
to invite any connections, use functions like LinkedIn Answers, apply for jobs 
on LinkedIn’s job board, or take advantage of most other LinkedIn functions.
Open your e-mail program and look for an e-mail from LinkedIn Email 
Confirmation with the subject line Please confirm your e-mail 
address. When you open that e-mail, you should see an e-mail confirmation, 
as shown in Figure 2-10. Either click the link Click Here to Confirm Your Email 
Address or copy and paste the URL provided in the e-mail into your Web 
browser. 
When you click the link, you are taken back to LinkedIn and asked to confirm 
your address, as seen in Figure 2-11. Click the Confirm button to confirm the 
e-mail address for your account. You will be asked to log in to your account, 
so simply provide your e-mail address and password when prompted. 

37

After you’ve confirmed your e-mail address, you are taken back to the Build

In the meantime, if you want to check your e-mail, you can find a “Welcome 
to LinkedIn!” message there from LinkedIn Updates, assuring you that you’re 
now a registered LinkedIn user. The e-mail, as shown in Figure 2-12, has some 
useful links that you may want to explore later, including a tour of LinkedIn 
and how it works. The e-mail also offers some ways to find contacts, but 
you’ll find the process simpler if you first use the Build Your Network system 
supplied in this process of signing up.

Starting to Build Your Network
You’re ready to look at how to build your network, with tools and forms pro-
vided by LinkedIn. Your first step is to decide who you want to invite to con-
nect with you on LinkedIn.
 
Your profile is so important it got its own chapter (Chapter 3 if you really 
must know). Be sure to completely fill out your profile before you start invit-
ing people to connect. Having a complete profile makes it easier to find former 
colleagues and classmates. After all, if you invite someone that you haven’t 
spoken to recently, they will take a quick look at your profile before respond-
ing. If they don’t see a part of your professional history where they know you, 
they will most likely ignore your invitation. 

39
 Chapter 2: Sign Me Up!
After you’ve joined LinkedIn, you may find yourself in one of the following 
situations: 
 
 You feel compelled to start inviting friends and colleagues to connect with 
you right away, before working on your profile or thinking of a strategy.
 
 You get nervous and decide not to invite anybody beyond one or two 
close friends or family members. 
 
 You wonder about the value of LinkedIn and leave your account alone 
for a long period of time with no activity. 
I will admit, I have seen all three situations occur with various people who 
have joined LinkedIn, so don’t feel bad if one of these is your natural reac-
tion. Your best bet is to start using LinkedIn with some thought and planning, 
which is where I come in (along with this book, of course) with some advice. 
So, let’s start by talking about who you would like to invite to your network.
LinkedIn provides a neat tool to help you identify, in your existing networks, 
people you know and trust well enough to feel confident about inviting them 
and expecting that they will accept.
The multi-faceted Build Your Network tool, as shown in Figure 2-13, is a part 
of your initial LinkedIn home page, and it is worth studying for a moment. 
The Build Your Network tool incorporates four basic options to identify and 
grow your network:
 
 Check your address book for contacts to invite with options for systems 
like Outlook and Apple Mail. 
 
 Check your address book for an e-mail system only available on the 
Web, like Yahoo!, Gmail, and AOL.
 
 Reconnect with past colleagues.
 
 Find former classmates.
We cover these techniques in greater detail in Chapter 6. I recommend that 
you spend a little time thinking about who you want to invite, then focus on 
getting your profile set up first and then inviting people. 
 
LinkedIn makes it very easy for you to send invitations in bulk — to your 
entire contact list if you want. However, even though it’s easy to do, it’s not 
necessarily a good idea. It can have negative social implications and can even 
potentially get you suspended from LinkedIn (and you wouldn’t want that!). 
Exercising some discretion with regards to the people you invite (and how — 
see Chapter 5) will serve you better in the long run.

A
fter you’ve registered with LinkedIn and worked to build your network 
by looking outward, it’s time to look inward by focusing on your profile. 
Think of your LinkedIn profile as your personal home page to the business 
world: This profile exists to give anyone a complete picture of your back-
ground, qualifications, and skills, as well as paint a picture of who you are 
beyond the numbers and bullet points. 
In this chapter, I walk you through all the different sections of your profile 
and explain how to update them and put the right information in a concise 
and appealing manner. I take you through the steps of adding information at 
each stage, so you can update your profile now or down the road (say, when 
you finish that amazing project or get that spiffy promotion you’ve been 
working towards). 
 
At any time, you can go to www.linkedin.com and click the Profile link in 
the top-left corner to access your LinkedIn profile to view or make changes.

42
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Determining the Contact Settings 
for Your Profile
Before you dive right in and start updating your profile, stop and think 
about what kind of profile you want to construct and show to the world. 
Specifically, think about the ways in which you want to use LinkedIn. For 
example, some people just want to add to their network, but others are 
actively looking for a job. You can have many reasons for using LinkedIn, 
and you can identify yourself through setting up your Contact Settings on 
LinkedIn. The ones you choose mainly depend on what you plan to use 
LinkedIn for, as discussed in Chapter 2. You can always go back and update 
your contact settings as your situation changes. 
You can select from eight main contact settings in your LinkedIn profile. Each 
describes a type of opportunity that lets other people know what they can 
approach you with on the site:
 
 Career opportunities: If you’re looking to augment your skill set so you 
can advance your career, or if you want to network with people that 
could approach you with a career opportunity now or in the future, 
you’d want to select this setting. 
 
 Expertise requests: If you’re available to provide expertise on your main sub-
ject areas to someone with a question or opportunity, select this setting. 
 
 Consulting offers: If you want to be open to receiving offers to do con-
sulting work for another company or individual, you’d want to select 
this setting. You can always accept or reject offers as they come in, but 
selecting this setting means you’re open for consideration. 
 
 Business deals: If you’re open to doing a business deal, either for your 
main job or your entrepreneurial venture, you’d want to select this set-
ting. Deals here could range from supplier/vendor requests, launching a 
new line of products, or doing a joint venture. 
 
 New ventures: If you’re interested in participating in a new company, 
either as an employee, co-owner, financier, or anything else, select this 
setting. 
 
 Personal reference requests: If you’re open to providing references for 
your first-degree connections when someone asks for one, you’d want to 
select this setting. 
 
 Job inquiries: If you’re open to receiving job offers or interests from 
other companies, you’d want to select this setting. 
 
 Requests to reconnect: If you’re interested in old friends, colleagues, 
and classmates, to send you a request to connect with you on LinkedIn, 
select this setting. 

43
 Chapter 3: Building Your Own Profile
After you select your settings, they show up as a bulleted list on your profile. 
In addition, they help determine or block the type of communication that you 
receive on LinkedIn. For example, if you aren’t interested in job inquiries, you 
shouldn’t receive any direct solicitations to apply for a job. 
Adding Your Summary to LinkedIn
Your LinkedIn profile’s Summary section, which appears in the top third of 
your profile, should give any reader a quick idea of who you are, what you’ve 
accomplished, and most importantly, what you’re looking for on LinkedIn. 
Some people think of their summary as their “elevator pitch,” or their 
30-second introduction of themselves that they tell to any new contact. Other 
people think of their summary as simply their resume summary, which gives 
a high-level overview of their experience and job goals. Each summary is as 
individual as the person writing it, but there are right ways and wrong ways 
to prepare and update your summary.
LinkedIn has split up the Summary section into four distinct parts:
 
 Your professional “headline.” Think of this as your job title. This is 
displayed underneath your name on LinkedIn, in search results, con-
nections lists, and on your profile. Therefore, you want a headline 
that grabs people’s attention. Some people put their job title; other 
people add some colorful adjectives and include two or three different 
professions. For example, I entered “Dummies Book Author; Owner, 
NewComix.Com,” indicating two of my main professions. 
 
 Your primary industry of experience. This is a list of industries you can 
choose from to indicate your main industry affiliation. 
 
 Your professional experience and goals. This is typically a one-paragraph 
summary of your current and past accomplishments and future goals. See the 
next section for more on how to construct the right paragraph for this part. 
 
 Your specialties in your industry of expertise. This is a list of your 
specific skills and talents. This is separate from your professional expe-
rience in that this section allows you to list specific job skills (for exam-
ple, contract negotiation or writing HTML software code) as opposed 
to the daily responsibilities or accomplishments from your job that you 
would list in the professional experience and goals paragraph.
Writing your summary first
Before you plan to update your summary on LinkedIn, we advise writing it 
out, using a program like Microsoft Word so that you can easily copy and 
paste it once written. This will allow you to organize your thoughts, decide 

44
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
on the right order of your statements, and pick and choose the most impor-
tant statements to put in your summary.
Of course, the goals of your summary should be the same as your goals for 
using LinkedIn, because your summary is the starting point for most people 
when they read your profile. As you write out your summary, keep these 
points in mind:
 
 Be concise. Remember, this is a summary, not a 300-page memoir of 
your life. Most summaries are one paragraph long, with a separate para-
graph to list your skills and/or specialties. Give the highlights of what 
you’ve done and are planning to do. Save the detailed information for 
when you add your individual employment positions to your profile.
 
 Pick three to five of your most important accomplishments. Your 
profile can have lots of detail regarding your jobs, skill sets, education, 
and honors, but your summary needs to reflect the three to five items 
throughout your career that you most want people to know. Think of 
it this way: If someone were introducing you to another person, what 
would you want this new person to know about you right away? 
 
 Depending on your goals for LinkedIn, the accomplishments you put in 
your summary may not be your biggest accomplishments overall. For 
example, if you’re trying to use LinkedIn to get a new job, your summary 
should include accomplishments that matter most to an employer in 
your desired field. 
 
 Organize your summary in a Who, What, Goals format. Typically, the first 
sentence of your summary should be a statement of Who you are currently, 
meaning your current profession or status. (For example, “Software project 
manager with extensive experience in Fortune 500 firms.”) The next few 
sentences should focus on What you’ve done so far in your career, and the 
end of your summary should focus on your Goals for the future. 
 
 Use the right keywords in your summary. Keywords are especially 
important if you’re looking for a new job or hoping to pick up some con-
sulting work. Although you should use a few keywords in your profes-
sional experience paragraph, you should really use all the appropriate 
keywords for skills you’ve acquired when you write the Specialties sec-
tion of your summary. Potential employers will scan that section looking 
for the right qualifications first, before making any contact.
 
 Be honest with your specialties, but don’t be shy. Your Specialties 
section is your opportunity to list any skill or trade that you feel you’ve 
learned and demonstrated with some ability. Some people see it as 
a chance to list out the “hottest” skills for their industry, in hopes of 
impressing a potential employer. Typically, a prospective employer will 
detect this during the interview phase, which wastes everybody’s time. 
Conversely, however, some people don’t list a skill here unless they feel 
they’re an expert at it. You should list any skill or specialty where you 
believe you are above the level of a novice or pure beginner.

Updating your LinkedIn profile’s 
Summary section
When you have an idea of what you want to put in your profile’s Summary 
section, it’s time to go into LinkedIn and plug that data into the correct fields. 
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu. 
 
 You’re taken to the Profile page.
 
2. Scroll down to the Summary section and click the Edit link below the 
Summary section header. 
 
 You now see the Professional Summary page, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
 
 The first step is to input your professional headline, which is to say your 
main job title. You can put any job title here, but make sure it conveys 
your main role as you want others to see it.

3. Click the drop-down arrow under the text What Is Your Primary 
Industry of Experience? and select the industry you most associate 
with your career. 
 
 There are over 140 different designations, so take a few moments to do a 
quick scan of the list. Note that some of the industries listed are more spe-
cific than others. You want to pick the best match possible. For instance, 
if you create custom graphics for Web sites, you could select Internet as 
your industry, but an even better choice would be Online Media. 
 
4. In the Summarize Your Professional Experience and Goals text box, 
enter a paragraph that sums you up professionally (as discussed in the 
previous section). 
 
 Although there is a 2,000 character limit, you can benefit from writing a 
concise and focused paragraph. 
 
5. Scroll down to the final section of the Professional Summary page, as 
shown in Figure 3-2, and enter your skills and/or specialties in the text 
box provided.
 
 Remember to separate each item with a comma, and don’t put any punc-
tuation after the last item in your list. You don’t need to press Enter 
between skills.
 
6. When you’re done, click the Save Changes button to save your summary. 
 
 You’re taken back to your Profile page.

 Chapter 3: Building Your Own Profile
Adding a Position to Your LinkedIn Profile
One of the most important aspects of your LinkedIn profile is the list of posi-
tions you’ve held over the years, including your current job. This list is espe-
cially important if you’re using LinkedIn to find a new or different career or to 
reconnect with past colleagues. Hiring managers want to see your complete 
history to know what skills you can offer, and past colleagues can’t find you 
as easily through LinkedIn if the job they knew you from isn’t on your profile. 
Therefore, it’s critical to make sure you have all the positions posted on your 
profile with the correct information. 
For a company that’s in LinkedIn’s directory, you need to fill in the following 
fields:
 
 Company name (and display name, if your company goes by more than 
one name)
The $5,000 profile update
I have a great example of why you should update 
your profile. Jefre Outlaw’s LinkedIn profile says 
that he’s a “portfolio entrepreneur.” His profile 
didn’t mention, however, that Mr. Outlaw spent 
more than 20 years as a real estate investor and 
developer, nor that he had recently obtained his 
own real estate license and joined his cousin 
Blake’s agency, Outlaw Real Estate Group. He 
realized a golden opportunity was available to 
him through LinkedIn.
Outlaw 
was 
interviewed 
for 
the 
LinkedIntelligence blog (www.linked
intelligence.com/the-5000-
profile-update). “At first I completely 
forgot about updating my LinkedIn profile,” he 
said. “But I got a request to forward an intro-
duction, and it reminded me that I should prob-
ably go update my profile to include my new gig 
as a realtor.”
This turned out to be a valuable update for 
Outlaw. 
Several weeks later, someone from his 
extended network was using LinkedIn to 
search for realtors and saw Outlaw’s profile. 
This person contacted Outlaw about listing a 
home for sale. Well, the potential client signed 
up with Outlaw’s agency, who was able to sell 
the house quickly for $170,000. When you do the 
math, $170,000 home × 3% commission = about 
$5,000 to the brokerage.
As Outlaw relayed his experience to 
LinkedIntelligence, he wanted his story to be 
clear. “Let’s not overstate what happened,” 
said Outlaw. “Being on LinkedIn didn’t get me 
the business. We [Outlaw’s real estate agency] 
were one of several realtors the client talked to, 
and I brought in my cousin, who’s a great closer 
and more experienced than I, to meet with the 
client. But the fact that I was in [LinkedIn], that 
my profile was up-to-date, that I have over 20 
really good Recommendations on my profile — 
all that put us on the short list.”
The moral of the story is simple. Keep your 
profile up to date on everything you’re doing. 
If your profile isn’t up to date, plan to update it 
right away — you may never know what oppor-
tunities you’re missing out of by ignoring your 
profile. 

48
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
 Your job title while working for the company
 
 The time period you worked for the company
 
 Description of your job duties
If your company is not listed in LinkedIn’s directory, you need to fill in the 
industry, type, size, and stock ticker symbol for the company.
 
You may want to have a copy of your resume handy when completing this 
section, because most resumes have all or most of the information required. 
To add a position to your LinkedIn profile, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu. 
 
 This step takes you to the Profile page.
 
2. Scroll down your profile until you see the Experience header and 
click the Add Position button. 
 
 You’re now taken to the Add Position page, as shown in Figure 3-3. 
 
3. In the text boxes provided, enter the information about your position, 
including company, title, time period, and job description.

 Chapter 3: Building Your Own Profile
 
 When you type in your company information, LinkedIn checks that name 
against a database of thousands of companies from their records, and 
you see suggested company names as you type. If you see your company 
name in that list, click the name, and LinkedIn automatically fills in all 
the company detail information for you.
 
4. When you’re done entering information, click the Save Changes 
button. 
 
 This adds the newly entered position into your profile, and you’re taken 
back to your Profile page. 
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 for any additional position you want to 
enter. 
To edit a position you already have listed, simply click the Edit link next to 
that record, instead of clicking the Add Position button. 
 
The Experience section isn’t just for paid full-time employment. You can add 
position information for any contract work, non-profit assignments, or other 
valid work experience you did that added to your skill set. If you’ve written a 
book, maintain a blog, or have a regular magazine column, you might want to 
list that as a separate position.
If you have most of the information that LinkedIn asks for a given position 
but you’re missing a few details in the description, go ahead and add what-
ever you’ve got. (You must provide a job title, company, and time period to 
save the position in your profile.) You can always come back later and fill 
in any missing information. In addition, if you make your profile public (as 
discussed later in this chapter in the section “Setting your Profile URL and 
public view”), then make sure any position information you enter is some-
thing you don’t mind the whole world — including past employers — seeing 
on your profile. 
Reporting Your Education on Your Profile
After you’ve documented your past and current jobs, it’s time to move 
onto the next part of your profile, namely Education. After all, besides at 
your jobs, where else are you going to meet and stay in touch with so many 
people? At school, of course! Your Education section says a lot about you, 
especially to potential employers and to former schoolmates who are looking 
to reconnect with you.
When you signed up with LinkedIn, you were asked to provide your basic 
education information. However, you may have more than one school to list, 
or perhaps you didn’t create a full listing for the schools you put down upon 
registration. In either case, whenever you find a moment, you can go back to 
make sure that your profile is up to date and has all your education listed. 

50
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Some people ask how much education you should list on your profile. 
Although you could theoretically go all the way back to preschool or kinder-
garten, most people start with high school or undergraduate education. This 
is up to you, but keep in mind that the more items you list, the greater the 
opportunity that your past schoolmates can locate and contact you.
 
This section isn’t limited to high school, undergraduate, and post-graduate 
education. You should also list any vocational education, certification 
courses, and any other stint at an educational institution that matters to your 
career or personal direction.
When you’re ready to update or add your education information, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu. 
 
2. Scroll down your profile until you see the Education header. Click the 
Add Education button to continue.
 
 The Add Education page appears, as shown in Figure 3-4. This is the 
page where you enter the information about your school.

3. From the drop-down lists provided, select the Country and State 
where your school was located.
 
 LinkedIn then displays a drop-down list of schools. 
 
4. Look through the alphabetized list to find your school and select it. If 
your school name doesn’t appear, select Other and then type in the 
school name in the new text box provided.
 
5. Complete the degree information about your education. 
 
 This includes filling in your degree type, fields of study (if applicable), 
and the years you attended this institution. For your degree type, you 
can either provide an abbreviation (BS, BA, and so on) or write out the 
entire degree name (Masters of Science, Doctorate, and so on). The 
Fields of Study text box is optional, but if you had a specific major or 
emphasis, this is the box to put that information in. Finally, for dates 
attended, if you’re still attending this institution, simply fill in your 
expected graduation date. 
 
6. Scroll down to the Activities and Societies text box and fill it in. 
 
 This is the place to enter any extracurricular activities you participated 
in while attending this school. Enter any clubs or organizations you 
belonged to (including any officer positions you held in those clubs) and 
any societies you joined or were given membership to, such as honor 
societies, fraternities, or sororities. 
 
 Don’t forget to separate each of your activities with a comma. 
 
7. Scroll down to the Additional Notes text box and enter any additional 
information about your education experience. 
 
 This is the place to enter any awards or honors received from this 
school, as well as any special events or experiences that did not fit in 
the Activities and Societies box, such as studying abroad, events you 
organized, or committees that you served on at this school. You can 
separate each item with a period.
 
 You should also list all your awards and honors under the appropriate 
field in Additional Information, which I cover in the next section.
 
8. When you’re done entering information, scroll down and click the 
Save Changes button. 
 
 This step adds the newly entered education listing into your profile, and 
you will be taken back to your Profile page. 
 
9. Repeat Steps 2 through 8 for any additional education listings you 
want to enter. 
 
 If you want to edit an existing education record, click the Edit link next 
to that record, instead of the Add Education button.

Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
Completing the Additional Information 
for Your Profile
Whenever you meet someone, the most common questions you ask are, “So, 
what do you do?” and “Where did you go to school?” However, there’s more 
to you than your jobs and education, and LinkedIn has created an Additional 
Information section to reflect that and to tie your LinkedIn profile to your 
other Internet and real-life identities. 
The Additional Information section allows you to provide lots of information 
in these areas:
 
 Web sites: LinkedIn allows you to add up to three different Web site 
links, which will point from your LinkedIn profile to whatever Web 
site(s) you designate, such as your personal Web site, your company 
Web site, a blog, an RSS feed, or any other promotional mechanisms you 
use online. 
 
 When you add a link from your LinkedIn profile to your other Web sites, 
this helps the search engine rankings for those pages because those 
rankings are partially determined by the quantity and quality of Web 
pages that link to them, and LinkedIn is a high-quality site as far as the 
search engines are concerned. You must make your profile public to 
receive these benefits. 
 
 Interests: This section is designed to highlight your extracurricular 
activities and what you like to do in your spare time. It allows potential 
contacts to see what else they may have in common with you (favorite 
hobbies or sports) and gives potential employers a glimpse into what 
else interests you outside a job. 
 
 Groups and Associations: This section is designed to illustrate what 
organizations you belong to and what formal activities you do in your 
spare time. Many people use this section to highlight any charity work 
they participate in, any networking groups they belong to, or any reli-
gious or political groups where they attend services or rallies. 
 
 Honors and Awards: This section is designed to announce to the world 
any distinctions or awards you have earned throughout your career. 
This could be work-related, like Salesman of the Year; education-
related, like Summa Cum Laude or Dean’s List; group-related, like Best 
Fundraiser; or even sports-related, like 1st Place Men’s Singles in the 
City Tennis Tournament. 
 
These items are completely optional for you to complete, but a strong, well-
rounded profile usually helps you in your career or networking goals because 
it gives you more opportunities to connect with someone (“Hey, Joel’s a big 
travel fan. So am I!”) or allows people to identify with your situation. 

53
 Chapter 3: Building Your Own Profile
When you’re ready to update the rest of the information on your profile, 
simply follow these steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu.
 
 You’re taken to the Profile page.
 
2. Scroll down your profile until you see the Additional Information sec-
tion header.
 
 You should see an Edit link below that header. Click that link to 
continue. 
 
 You are now taken to the Additional Information page, as shown in 
Figure 3-5. This is the page where you enter the additional information 
about yourself, from associated Web sites to interests, groups, and 
awards. 
 
Figure 3-5: 
Enter your 
Web sites 
and 
interests 
in the 
Additional 
Information 
window. 
 
 
3. Under Websites, in the drop-down lists on the left, select short 
descriptions for the sites you intend to display. 
 
 You can pick from the predefined list of descriptions (like My Company, 
My Website, and so on), or you can pick Other and, in the blank text box 
that appears, type in a brief custom description for your Web site link 
(like My Rotary Club page or My eBay page). 

54
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
 This description is what’s going to appear as a link on your profile — the 
reader isn’t going to see the site’s URL.
 
 Search engines look at the text used in these links when calculating 
rankings. So if there are certain keywords for which you want your site 
to rank higher, you may want to include them in the link text. So for 
example, you might want to say “Springfield Toastmasters” rather than 
“My Toastmasters Club.”
 
4. Still in the Websites section, in the text boxes to the right, enter the 
URLs of the Web sites you want to list on your profile, corresponding 
to the correct descriptions on the left. 
 
 You can add up to three URLs to your LinkedIn profile, so use them 
wisely. 
 
 This might seem obvious, but, well, people are going to be able to click 
those links and check out your Web sites. Sure, that’s the point, but 
do you remember that hilarious yet embarrassing picture of yourself 
you added to your personal site, or that tirade you posted in your blog 
about a co-worker or tough project? Before you link to a site from your 
LinkedIn profile, scour it and make sure you won’t end up scaring off 
your contacts. 
 
5. Complete the Interests text box. 
 
 This is your chance to tell the world a little more about you besides your 
jobs and education. Make sure to separate each interest with a comma. 
 
 You probably want to omit any interests that a potential employer 
wouldn’t like to see. For instance, if you work in the entertainment indus-
try, talking about how you love to download pirated movies will not make 
any hiring manager happy. Talk instead about how you love to watch 
licensed content from approved sources like iTunes or Amazon Unbox!
 
6. Scroll down to the Groups and Associations text box, as shown in 
Figure 3-6, and fill it in. 
 
 This is the text box where you can list your groups not listed under any 
school, such as any charity groups, religious organizations, alumni asso-
ciations, rotary clubs, and so on. 
 
7. Scroll down to the Honors and Awards text box and fill it in. 
 
 This is where you can list your accolades from jobs, school, or any 
extracurricular activity. Even if you listed an award under your 
Education section, feel free to repeat it here. 
 
8. When you’re done entering information, click the Save Changes 
button. 
 
 This step updates your Additional Information section in your profile, 
and you’re taken back to your Profile page.

Reviewing Your LinkedIn Profile
After you’ve gone through the various sections of your LinkedIn profile and 
added the critical information, you should review your profile and make sure 
it appears exactly the way you want other people to see it, as well as decide 
how much information is visible to the public and what others on LinkedIn 
can contact you about in what regard. 
Viewing your profile as others see it
As you’re updating your LinkedIn profile, you may want to view your profile 
to see how it will be displayed on the computer screen when anyone clicks to 
view your profile. You have several ways of accomplishing this:
 
 In the left navigation menu, click the View My Profile link under the 
Profile link to see your profile as it would appear. (If your left navigation 
menu isn’t expanded, click the plus sign next to the word Profile in the 
menu.) The link whisks you away to the Profile page, and there you can 
see that the View My Profile tab is selected and waiting for your review.

56
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
 While editing your profile, you can see two tabs under the Profile header 
in the middle of the screen, Edit My Profile, and View My Profile, as 
shown in Figure 3-7. Click the View My Profile tab to see your profile.
 
Figure 3-7:

Setting your profile URL and public view
After you’ve fully updated your LinkedIn profile, your next goal is probably to 
share it with the entire world, not just your LinkedIn network. The best way 
to accomplish this is to set up your profile so that your full profile is avail-
able for public viewing. 
Setting your profile to full public view gives you several advantages:
 
 Anyone looking for you has a better chance of finding you because of the 
increased information tied to your name. 
 
 When you make your profile public, it gets indexed in both the Google 
and Yahoo! search databases. This makes your online identity acces-
sible and controlled by your access to LinkedIn.
 
 You give increased exposure to any companies, projects, or initiatives that 
you’re working on by having that credit published on your LinkedIn profile. 

57
 Chapter 3: Building Your Own Profile
When you’re ready to set your profile to Public, just follow these steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu. 
 
 You arrive at the Profile page. Look to the right of the Edit my Profile 
and View My Profile tabs, for a link that says Edit Public Profile Settings, 
like in Figure 3-8.

2. Click the Edit Public Profile Settings link. 
 
 This step takes you to the Public Profile settings page, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to set a custom URL for your LinkedIn profile, 
fill in the text box next to the Set Address button. 
 
 You can enter anywhere between 5 and 30 numbers or letters, but don’t 
put in any spaces, symbols, or special characters. When you’ve picked 
your custom address, click the Set Address button to save your changes. 
 
 After you set a custom URL, this text box will be hidden if you come 
back to this process. You should keep your URL changes to a minimum 
(preferably, just set it once and leave it), so everyone will know how to 
get to your profile, especially the search engines. Otherwise, you’ll have 
different versions of your profile with different URL’s in different places 
on the Internet.

4. Scroll down the main Public Profile section on the page and deter-
mine what parts of your LinkedIn profile you want to be available for 
public viewing. 
 
 You have the option of picking which sections of your LinkedIn profile 
are public. To reveal a section on your public profile, simply select the 
check box next to that given section, as shown in Figure 3-10. Your basic 
information is already selected for you by default, but you can decide 
whether to add your education, positions, groups, or any other indi-
cated section. As you check off more sections, a preview of your Profile 
page on the right side of the page gets updated. 
 
5. When you’re done, click the Save Changes button to save your 
selections. 
 
 You’re taken back to your Public Profile settings page, and you should 
see a confirmation message at the top of the screen.
 
Whenever you’re editing your profile, you can scroll down and click the link 
next to the Public Profile header to see your public profile. On that page, you 
can click a button to view your full profile. This way, you can see the differ-
ence between your public and full profiles.

Checking your contact settings
You definitely want to make sure that you’ve selected the correct contact 
settings for your LinkedIn profile. After all, if you’re looking for a new job, 
for example, you want to make sure that the option for Career Opportunities 
has been checked off. (I go into plenty of detail about the eight main contact 
settings in the earlier section “Determining the Contact Settings for Your 
Profile.”) When you’re ready to check your contact settings, just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn and log in. Click the Profile link in the left navigation 
menu.
 
 Your browser presents you with the Profile page.
 
2. Scroll down the page to the bottom of your profile. Under the Contact 
Settings section header, click the Edit link.
 
 This brings you to the Contact Settings page, as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
3. Select an option under the What Type of Messages Will You Accept? 
question.
 
 If you want to receive InMail e-mails from people who aren’t direct con-
nections in your network, make sure the option I’ll Accept Introductions 
and InMail is selected. 

60
Part I: LinkedIn Basics 
 
Figure 3-11: 
Here you 
can update 
your contact 
settings for 
your profile. 
 
 
 Otherwise, select the I’ll Accept Only Introductions option to block 
anyone sending you InMail. Your first-level (direct) connections will 
always be able to send you a message through LinkedIn. 
 
4. Make sure the correct options are selected in the Opportunity 
Preferences section.
 
 The items you have selected here show up as a bulleted list in your pro-
file and will limit (or allow) the ways in which other LinkedIn members 
can contact you. If you don’t want to receive any InMail or Introductions 
from other LinkedIn users, you can uncheck all those boxes and no 
options to contact you will be displayed on your profile. 
 
5. (Optional) If you want to give special instructions on how people can 
contact you, fill in that information in the indicated text box. 
 
 For example, if you require a few pieces of information from someone 
before you will add them to your network, you can indicate that in this 
text box. You can also indicate whether this is a good time to contact 
you, or what projects or subject areas you’re currently involved in. 
 
6. When you’re done updating this page, click the Save Changes button 
to save your selections. 
 
 You’re taken to your Account & Settings page. 

Part II
Finding Others and 
Getting Connected

In this part . . .
T
here are days when I’m amazed at how small the 
world is — for instance, when I find out that someone 
I met randomly while I was 3,000 miles from home is 
related to a good friend of mine from California. The more 
you ask around and get involved, the more you realize 
that all these great connections are out there, just waiting 
to be discovered. Maybe Kevin Bacon is less than six 
degrees apart from me. But I digress. . . .
This part covers the essentials of building and growing 
your network of connections on LinkedIn. I start by talking 
about how you can search the database far and wide for 
the person or people you know, and then I tell you how 
you can send them invitations or use a friend to send an 
Introduction to someone new. I go through a lot of tips 
and advice on how to grow your network, using LinkedIn 
functionality and your own ingenuity. I end the part by 
talking about one of the great ways to see others and be 
seen on the site, the LinkedIn Answers section, where you 
can share and gather knowledge on all sorts of topics.

fter you’ve signed up for LinkedIn and built your profile (see Chapters 2

how valuable LinkedIn can be to you. LinkedIn is the embodiment of the Six 
Degrees of Separation concept because in most cases you can connect to any 
other person in the network whether you already know her or not.
In this chapter, I demonstrate the different ways you can search the LinkedIn 
network. By that, I mean your ever-growing personal network and the greater 
LinkedIn member network. I talk about viewing your own network, searching 
within the second and third levels of your network, and performing searches 
on LinkedIn using different types of criteria or search terms. 
Viewing Your Connections
I seem to recall an old saying: “Before you know where you can go, you have 
to know where you are” or something like that. This holds true even for 
LinkedIn. Before you start searching throughout the network, it’s helpful to 
understand the reach of your own immediate network and how your first-
degree connection’s networks add up to keep you connected with a lot of 
people. The first thing you should do is get familiar with your own LinkedIn 
network.

Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
To view your LinkedIn network and also some nifty statistics about your net-
work, just follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to LinkedIn. From the left navigation menu, click the plus 
button next to the Contacts link and then click the Connections link. 
 
 This brings up a list of your current Connections on the Contacts page, 
as shown in Figure 4-1. You can scroll through the list or click the letter 
of the alphabet (located along the left side) to go straight to that section 
of your Connections list.
 
Figure 4-1: 
An 
alphabetical 
list of your 
connections.
 
 
2. Click the Advanced Options link to filter your list of connections by 
location or industry. 
 
 For example, if you click the Advanced Options button, you bring up the 
two filter drop-down lists (as shown in Figure 4-2): the Filter by Location 
and Filter by Industry drop-down lists. With these filters, you can dis-
play a list of your connections that live in a greater metropolitan area 
of a certain city or work in a particular industry. The drop-down lists 
only contain options for people who are your first-level direct contacts. 
Suppose you’re looking for Internet professionals in the Austin, Texas 
area. LinkedIn can show you who in your network matches that request! 
If you don’t see Austin, TX in the list, that means none of your first-level 
connections reside in Austin.

3. Click the Network Statistics tab to see the overall summary of your 
network.
 
 When you click the Network Statistics tab, you see a page like the 
one in Figure 4-3. Not only does this have the current count of your 
Connections, but it shows how many people are considered your 
second-degree connections (a friend of one of your connections) or 
third-degree connections (a friend of a friend of your friend) that you 
can search or reach through an Introduction.

4. Scroll down this page to the Regional Access and Industry Access 
sections to see a breakdown of where the folks in your network are 
located and what they do. 
 
 The last two sections on the Network Statistics tab are Regional Access 
and Industry Access, as shown in Figure 4-4. LinkedIn shows you the 
percentage breakdown of which regions are the most popular in your 
network and which industries are represented in your extended network 
of first-, second-, and third-degree connections. 
 
Figure 4-4: 
See the 
region and 
industry 
breakdown 
of your 
network.
 
 
If you click any of the top five regions or industries on this page, LinkedIn 
automatically performs a search of your network with that criteria. So, if you 
want to see your network contacts that live in the greater New York City area, 
click the Greater New York City Area link in the Regional Access list.

 Chapter 4: Searching LinkedIn
Searching the LinkedIn Network
When you’re ready to find a specific person, it’s time to get to know the 
LinkedIn search engine, which allows you to scan the tens of millions of 
LinkedIn members based on keywords you provide. Currently, you have two 
main ways to search the network: a basic search and the Advanced Search. 
At the top-right corner of every page on LinkedIn, you can find a simple search 
form. This feature performs a keyword search on the LinkedIn database. 
Generally, it works just fine if you’re searching only for a specific name, employ-
ees of a particular company, or people with a specific job title In fact, you’ll get 
a lot of results with the basic search because you’re searching each LinkedIn 
member’s entire profile for your keywords, not just one field. For example, if you 
type Mike Jones in the basic search box, as opposed to searching by the name 
Mike Jones (see the section “Searching by Name” later in this chapter), you get a 
larger set of results because you will see every profile where the words Mike and 
Jones were anywhere in the profile. (When you search by Name, LinkedIn will 
only search everyone’s Name field.) Keep this in mind when you do your search, 
and pick the method you want based on your goals.
Now, in some situations, the simple search just doesn’t cut it because you 
want to specify whether you’re searching for someone’s name, title, employer, 
industry, skills, location, or some combination thereof. In those cases, you 
need the Advanced Search function, which you can access in several ways:
 
 From almost any page on LinkedIn, you can click the link Advanced 
Search, near the top-right corner of the page, to bring up the search page. 
If you’re using LinkedIn Jobs or LinkedIn Answers, clicking this link brings 
up the Job Search or Advanced Answers search page, respectively. 
 
 You can click the drop-down arrow next to People in the top-left corner 
of the LinkedIn home page, to bring up links to the Advanced People 
Search, Name Search, and Reference Search, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 
 If you download one of the toolbars or companion software (as dis-
cussed in Chapter 10), you can perform a search from the search box in 
that toolbar or software program. 
 
The examples in the rest of this chapter assume you are clicking the Advanced 
Search link from the top right of the page. However, feel free to pick the 
method of search you’re most comfortable with!

Sorting your advanced search results
Whenever you do an advanced search, LinkedIn defaults to sorting your search 
results by the keywords you provided in your search. However, that is not your 
only option. When you’re setting up your advanced search, you see an option 
entitled Sort By with a drop-down list containing four options. (If you’ve already 
generated search results, you can click the link refine search results to bring up 
this option.) You can sort your search results by picking from these four methods:
 
 Degrees and Recommendations: This sort method gives the top spots 
on the search result to people who are not only closely connected 
to you, but people who have received Recommendations from other 
LinkedIn members. This sort result helps you find the most recom-
mended person who is closely connected to you, as opposed to the 
Degrees away from you method, which simply shows the closest con-
nected person in terms of degrees of separation.
 
 Degrees away from you: This sort method shows you the people 
who are closely connected to you at the top of the list. This is incred-
ibly helpful if you’re searching for someone that you plan to contact, 
because you have a better chance of connecting with someone who 
is only two or three degrees away from you, in which case you can be 
introduced by one of your connections.

69
 Chapter 4: Searching LinkedIn
 
 Number of connections: This sort method shows you the people with 
the greatest number of connections on LinkedIn at the top of the list. 
This sort result helps you when your search involves looking for some-
one who needs to have a large network of first-degree connections. 
 
 Keyword relevance: This sort method is currently the default when you 
search on LinkedIn, and it simply returns the people whose profiles have 
the keywords you inputted in your search. Therefore, this sort result 
may put people at the top of the list who simply have the keywords in 
their profile multiple times. It gives some weight to members who are 
featured on LinkedIn, which means they have premium accounts or 
have OpenLink membership. Typically, the default search results show 
up under the Your Network tab (which appears directly above the first 
name in your results list) to get sort results that only contain your first-, 
second-, or third-degree connections on the list. This search is intended 
for situations where the keyword is more critical than the person.
Searching by keyword
Quick. Who do you know that knows how to write software code in PHP? 
Who do you know that enjoys mountain climbing or hiking? Do you know 
anybody that gives presentations on a regular basis? Well, with LinkedIn’s 
search capabilities, you can find out the answers to these questions, and 
more, when you search by keyword. 
When you search by keyword, LinkedIn analyzes everyone else’s profiles to 
find that matching word. You can put any sort of skill, buzzword, interest, or 
other keyword that would be present in someone’s profile, and see who in 
your network is a match. To search by keyword, just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, click the Advanced Search link at the top 
right of the page. 
 
 You’re taken to the People page, and the Advanced People Search tab is 
selected.
 
2. Enter the keyword(s) in the Keywords text box provided. 
 
 In Figure 4-6, you can see that I decided to search for Six Sigma 
Operations. If you enter multiple keywords like I did, LinkedIn looks for 
members that have all of the keywords in their profile. 
 
 I recommend tacking on additional search criteria, such as picking one 
or more industries, location information (country and ZIP/postal code), 
or perhaps a job title, so you can get a more meaningful search result. 
Otherwise, your result list will be long and unhelpful.

70
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 If you’re searching for a specific keyword phrase, like Six Sigma, put 
those words in quotation marks so LinkedIn will search for the exact 
phrase. Otherwise, LinkedIn searches each individual word, and you 
might get a result like mine in Figure 4-7, where I have the words six and 
Sigma in different places in my profile. Because LinkedIn found both 
words in my profile, even though those words didn’t appear together in 
one phrase, I came up on the search results page.

 You see the people in your extended network that have those keywords 
in their profile.

 The results window expands, and you can enter more information, like 
additional keywords, job titles, user types, or location information into the 
boxes provided, as shown in Figure 4-8. When you’re finished, click the 
Search button to run a more precise search that narrows down the list.

Searching by name
When you want to find a specific person on LinkedIn, you can search by 
name. LinkedIn has developed a special Name Search box that will help you 
find that person. When you search by name, you are required to enter the 
last name, and you can enter the first name, too. 
When you’re ready to search by name, just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, click the Advanced Search link at the top 
right of the page. 
 
 You’re taken to the People page, and the Advanced People Search tab is 
selected.
 
2. Click the Name Search tab along the top of the page. 
 
 On the Name Search tab, enter the last name (and first name, if you 
know it) into the text box provided (see Figure 4-9).

72

3. (Optional) You can input additional information to help identify the 
exact person you’re looking for. 
 
 If you know a company where the person used to work or is currently 
employed, you can input a company name into the box provided.
 
4. If you know the approximate location of this person, use the Location 
drop-down list to select the Located In or Near option. Then use the 
Country drop-down list and fill in the Postal Code text box.
 
 Only after you select Located In or Near can you pick a country from the 
next drop-down list and input a ZIP code in the box indicated, as shown 
in Figure 4-10. 
 
5. When you’re ready, click the Search button. 
 
 You see a results list of people, sorted by the degrees of connection in 
your overall LinkedIn network. (For example, people who are second-
level connections appear above people who are third-level connections.)
 
6. If you want to get better results, click the Refine Search Results 
button. 
 
 You can enter a full name, company name, or location information into 
the boxes provided. Then click the Search button.

Searching by company
Sometimes, you might need to search by company. Maybe you’re thinking of 
applying to a company, and you want to see who you know (or, rather, who is 
in your extended network) that works for that company, so you can approach 
them to ask some questions or get a referral. Perhaps you’re looking for a 
decision maker at a company that can help you with a deal, or you’re curious 
how active a particular company’s employees are on LinkedIn. 
Whatever the reason, LinkedIn is an excellent place for searching detailed 
corporate profiles of specific companies. When you’re ready to search by 
company, just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, click the Advanced Search link at the top 
right of the page. 
 
 You’re taken to the People page, and the Advanced People Search tab is 
selected.
 
2. Enter the name of the company in the Company text box provided (as 
shown in Figure 4-11). 
 
 If you want to search for only current employees of the company, leave the 
Current Companies Only check box selected. If you deselect it, your search 
results will include all the people who have ever worked for that company. 

74
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
Figure 4-11:

work(ed).
 
 
3. Click the Search button to start your search. 
 
 You see up to 500 results that match your company and exist some-
where in your extended network. (If you have paid for a premium 
account, you see the first 500 results on this page.)
 
4. If you click the LinkedIn Network (Top 20) link, you see a list of the top 
20 results within the entire LinkedIn system, as shown in Figure 4-12. 
 
 Notice that, in this list, you see the person’s professional headline, but 
not the person’s name. Because this person is not in your network, 
her name is private, and you have to send her an InMail to find out her 
name. (InMail is covered in Chapter 5.)
 
5. If you want to get better results, click the Refine Search Results 
button. 
 
 You can enter more information, like job titles, user types, or location 
information into the boxes provided. Click the Search button when 
you’re finished.

75

Searching by job title
Sometimes you might need to look for someone in a specific position rather 
than for a specific person. After all, who knows what you go through better 
than other people with the same job, right? Who better to give advice on a 
topic like Search Engine Optimization (SEO) than someone whose job relates 
to SEO, correct? 
Therefore, LinkedIn gives you the ability to search by job title instead of 
person. When you’re ready to search by job title, just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, click the Advanced Search link at the top 
right of the page. 
 
 You’re taken to the People page, and the Advanced People Search tab is 
selected.
 
2. Enter the job title in the Title box provided (Figure 4-13 shows Project 
Manager entered). 
 
 If you want to search for only people who currently have that title, leave 
Current Titles Only check box selected. If you deselect the box, your 
search results will include all the people who have ever held that job title. 

76
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
Figure 4-13: 
Search for 
people by 
their current 
or previous 
job title.
 
 
3. (Optional, but do it anyway if you can) Select at least one Industry 
from the list provided, so your search results are relevant to the job 
title search. 
 
 I highly recommend doing this step. After all, a Project Manager 
in Construction is completely different from a Project Manager in 
Computer Software. 
 
 You can actually select multiple industries from the list. On a PC, hold 
down the Ctrl button and click to select each industry you want to add 
to your search. On a Mac, hold down the Ô button and click to select 
each industry. 
 
4. When you’re ready, click the Search button to see your results. 
 
 You see a set of results that match your job title request. You can 
always click on the Refine Search Results button to add more informa-
tion and get a highly targeted list. 
Performing a Reference search
One of the benefits of LinkedIn is that it allows you to search for someone 
who might have worked with someone you’re researching. Perhaps you’re 
about to hire someone but would like to speak with someone else who knows 
your potential candidate because they worked together in the past. You 
could be deciding to hire a consultant for a project but want to contact 

77
 Chapter 4: Searching LinkedIn
someone who has hired this consultant in the past, to get a better idea of his 
work quality. Maybe you’re about to enter a business deal and want some 
information from someone who knows your potential new partner. 
LinkedIn has created the Reference search to give you a better window into the 
person or company. All you need is the company name and the range of years 
someone has worked there, and LinkedIn searches your network and shows you 
the people who match that search and how closely they’re connected to you.
To perform a Reference search, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Advanced Search link at the top right of the LinkedIn home 
page.
 
 You’re taken to the People page, and the Advanced People Search tab is 
selected.
 
2. Click the Reference Search tab along the top of the page.
 
 The Reference Search tab is shown in Figure 4-14.
 
Figure 4-14: 
Search 
LinkedIn for 
potential 
references 
for 
someone.
 
 
3. Enter the name of the company and a date range into the boxes provided. 
 
 For example, suppose you have a job candidate who claims to have 
worked for Top Cow Productions from 2000 to 2002. You would enter 
that company name and date range into the boxes provided. 

78
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 You can enter more than one company and date range, and you will get 
a list of potential references who worked at any of the companies on 
your search. 
 
4. When you’re ready, click the Search button to start your search. 
 
 If you have the basic account, you see a Summary page like the one 
shown in Figure 4-15. This gives you an idea of how many potential con-
nections exist and how many are connected to your immediate network. 
If you have a Business or Pro account, you would see a list of people 
(like in a name or job title search) that worked at the designated com-
pany in that timeframe and have the ability to contact them. (For more 
on the different account types, take a gander at Chapter 1.)

Managing Introductions 
and InMail
In This Chapter

 Sending InMail
 Accepting and forwarding requests
 Gracefully declining requests
O
ne of the goals of using LinkedIn is to expand your personal network 
and of friends and colleagues by seeing who is connected to you at 
each degree level. When you can see your second and third degree of your 
network, your next goal is to start interacting with these people and see how 
they might fit into your network, goals, or ambitions. However, the whole 
system of contacting people requires some order and decorum (otherwise, 
nobody would feel comfortable signing up for the site in the first place). 
Therefore, LinkedIn offers two methods for meeting and connecting with 
people outside your immediate network: Introductions and InMail. Not so 
coincidentally, I cover Introductions and InMail in this very chapter.
Introductions are simply where you ask to be introduced to a friend of 
a friend, and your friend can decide whether or not to pass along your 
Introduction to the intended target. InMail allows you to directly communi-
cate with anyone in the LinkedIn network through a private LinkedIn 
message. I also cover what to do when you get a request from a connection 
on LinkedIn. 
InMail versus Introductions
Your first question is, most likely, “What’s the difference between 
Introductions and InMail?” (Figure 5-1 shows an example of both.) The 
answer depends on how involved your common friend or colleague is in 
connecting you with this new contact. 

80
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
Figure 5-1: 
LinkedIn 
offers two 
ways of 
connecting 
with people 
outside your 
network. 
 

81
 Chapter 5: Managing Introductions and InMail
 
Every LinkedIn user decides on his own contact level, and it’s possible for 
a user to not allow any Introduction or InMail to reach him, regardless of 
sender. If you don’t want to receive any Introductions or InMail, simply 
deselect all the Contact Settings options. (See Chapter 3 for the section 
on checking your contact Settings.) If you don’t want any InMail, go to the 
Account & Settings page, find the Contact Settings section, and unselect the 
InMail option. 
Understanding Introductions
In the real world, if you’re at a party with your friend Michael, you might say 
to him, “You know, I’d really like to meet someone who can help me with 
some software tasks for my company.” In that case, Michael would look 
around, see his other friend James, and he would introduce you to James by 
saying, “Hello, James. This is my entrepreneur friend from business school, 
[Your Name Here]. [Your Name Here], this is my old buddy James. He and I 
studied computer science together in college.” After that, Michael might give 
some more background information about each person to the other. 
On LinkedIn, an Introduction is very similar to my real-world example. You 
send a request to someone in your immediate first-degree network (Michael) 
and ask that person to introduce you to someone in his or her network 
(James) by forwarding your request to the intended party. In some cases, 
if you’re trying to reach someone in your third-degree network (maybe James 
has a programming buddy you should talk to), your Introduction request 
would have to go to two different parties before reaching the intended 
recipient. 
Here are some benefits of using Introductions: 
 
 You’re represented by someone close. Instead of sending a random, 
unexpected e-mail to a stranger, you’re introduced by somebody who 
knows the intended party, even if that introduction is done with an 
e-mail. That gives your Introduction request a much higher chance of 
being read and getting a response. 
 
 You get your network involved. When you ask people in your network 
to get involved, they learn more about you and your intentions, and 
sometimes you might find what you’re looking for is closer than you 
think. In addition, when you ask them to pass along your Introduction 
request, you can offer to facilitate an Introduction on their behalf as 
well, which helps both parties. 
 
 You leverage the power of your network. By using LinkedIn, you not 
only expand your network by using your first-degree connections to 
help you meet new people, but you can decide who would make the 
Introduction for you. I recommend that you read up on your friend’s 

82
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
profile and your intended party’s profile and see what they have in 
common. 
 
 You can have multiple Introductions going on at one time. With a 
LinkedIn free account, you can have up to five open Introductions going 
at any one time. When you get introduced to your intended party, that 
spot opens up and you can make another Introduction request. InMail, 
in all cases, costs money, either on a per-mail basis or as part of a 
premium paid account. (So even someone with a free basic account 
can use InMail, for a cost.)
Getting to know InMail
Because everyone on LinkedIn has a profile and a secure e-mail Inbox within 
LinkedIn, communicating with other people online is easy. LinkedIn allows 
you to send InMail directly to an intended party, regardless of whether he 
is directly or indirectly connected with you. The e-mail gets immediately 
delivered to the recipient’s e-mail address and LinkedIn Inbox, without 
the sender learning of this address, so each party has some privacy. The 
recipient can read your profile and decide whether or not to respond. 
The cost of using InMail depends on whether you subscribe to a premium 
account. You can purchase InMail credits (one credit allows you to send one 
message) at a cost of $10 per InMail message. Premium accounts, such as the 
Business account for $19.99/month, come with a set number of InMail credits 
per month that roll over to the next month if unused. The Business account 
gets 3 credits per month, the Business Plus account gets 10 credits per 
month, and the Pro account gets 50 credits per month. 
Here are some benefits of using InMail:
 
 Instant delivery. With InMail, you simply write your message or request 
and send it directly to the intended party. There’s no delay as a request 
gets passed from person to person and waits for approval or forwarding. 
 
 You owe no favors. Sometimes, you just want to reach somebody 
without asking your friends to vouch for you. InMail allows you to send 
a request to someone new without involving anyone else. 
 
 It’s sure to be delivered. With Introductions, the party(ies) involved in 
the middle could choose to deny your request and not pass along the 
message. With InMail, you know that the intended party will get a copy 
of your message in his or her e-mail account and LinkedIn Inbox. 

83
 Chapter 5: Managing Introductions and InMail
Setting Up an Introduction
When you want to bring two (or more) parties together, you usually need 
to apply some thought to the process, whether it’s figuring out what both 
parties have in common, thinking up the words you’ll use to introduce party 
A to party B, or coming up with the timing of exactly when and where you 
plan to make the Introduction. On LinkedIn, you should do your best to make 
sure the Introduction process goes smoothly — but don’t worry, there’s not 
nearly as much social pressure. The following sections give you tips and 
pointers for setting up an Introduction.
Approaching each party 
in the Introduction 
When you want to send out an Introduction request, spend some time 
planning out your request before you log on to LinkedIn to generate and 
send it. Preparing a quality and proper Introduction goes a long way towards 
keeping your network in a helpful and enthusiastic mood, and it increases 
your chances of making a new and valuable connection. 
You need to prepare two messages: one for your intended recipient and 
one for your connection/friend. Each of these messages needs to perform 
a specific objective. Start with the message to your friend and keep the 
following tips in mind when you’re writing it: 
 
 Be honest and upfront. Say exactly what you hope to achieve so there 
are no surprises. If you tell your friend that you’re hoping her contact 
will be a new bowling buddy for you, but when you reach that contact, 
you ask for funding for your new business plan, then you’re in trouble. 
Your friend will probably never forward another request again, and the 
contact, who expected one type of interaction and got another, will see 
you as untrustworthy and be unlikely and/or unwilling to help on this 
request or any in the future. 
 
 Be polite and courteous. Remember, you’re asking your friend to vouch 
for you or back you up when your request goes to the intended party. So 
be polite when making your request and show your gratitude regardless 
of the outcome. 
 
 Be ready to give in order to get. One of the best ways to go far with 
your network is to offer some sort of reciprocal favor when you want 
someone to do a favor for you. Perhaps you can introduce your friend to 
one of your other contacts in exchange for your friend accepting your 
Introduction request. 

84
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 Be patient. Although you may be eager and under a deadline, your 
friends probably operate on different schedules and different levels of 
urgency. Some people are online all the time, other people log in to 
LinkedIn infrequently, and most people are completely disconnected at 
times, like when they’re on vacation or behind on a project. Asking your 
friend every 20 minutes whether she forwarded your request is an 
almost sure-fire way of getting that request bounced back to you. 
When writing your message to your intended recipient, keep these tips 
in mind: 
 
 Be honest and upfront. Just like with your friend, when you have a 
specific goal or request in mind, make it known in the message. The 
recipient is most likely busy and doesn’t know you, so if he spends the 
time to talk to you and finds out that you have an ulterior motive, he 
feels like his time was wasted and that he was deceived, which are 
NOT good feelings to create when trying to get help from someone. 
 
 Be succinct. You’re asking someone for his time, resources, or advice, 
so don’t beat around the bush too much. You should introduce yourself 
in your first sentence or two. Then you should explain why you’re con-
tacting the recipient and how you hope he can help you. 
 
 Be original. If you stick to the sample text that LinkedIn gives you, your 
message has an air of “Hey, I want to talk to you, but I don’t have a few 
seconds to really tell you what I’m after.” When you customize your 
message, you have a greater chance of capturing the other person’s 
attention. If your intended recipient gets a lot of requests, you’ll stand 
out if you show some effort to rise above the daily noise this person 
encounters. 
 
 Be ready to give in order to get. You’re asking for help of some sort, so 
be ready to give something, whether it’s gratitude, a reciprocal favor, or 
something more tangible. Most people are eager to help out, especially 
when they understand the situation, but having something to offer in 
exchange rarely hurts. Explain how you might provide something useful 
in return.
Sending an Introduction
When you’ve prepared your messages (one to your contact and one to the 
recipient) and you’re all ready to send an Introduction request, just follow 
these steps:

85
 Chapter 5: Managing Introductions and InMail
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, search for the person you’d like to meet.
 
 You can use the Search box in the top-right corner of any LinkedIn page, 
or you can click on your Connections and search your friend’s networks. 
(See Chapter 4 for the lowdown on searching LinkedIn.)
 
2. From the list of search results, click the name of the person you want 
to contact. (If you didn’t find the person you’re looking for, try 
another search.)
 
 This step takes you to the recipient’s profile page, where you should see 
two things: a chart along the right side of the page showing how you’re 
connected to this person and a link entitled Get Introduced through a 
Connection. (If you don’t have anyone in your network yet, you won’t 
see the chart or the link.)
 
 Suppose I’m hoping to be introduced to Patrick Crane, VP of Marketing 
& Advertising over at LinkedIn. When I get to Patrick’s profile page, I see 
that I have a connection to him (see Figure 5-2) in the form of an old high 
school buddy who now works with Patrick at LinkedIn. 
 
Figure 5-2:

This tells you how you’re connected to your recipient.

86
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
3. On the person’s profile page, click the Get Introduced through a 
Connection link to start the Introduction process. 
 
 You’re taken to the Request an Introduction page, as shown in Figure 
5-3. Fill out the contact information section that you would like to share 
with this individual. Then pick a category and subject for this request. 
Write a short but informative message as to why you want to meet this 
person. (See the preceding section, “Approaching each party,” for more 
about writing this message.)
 
4. Scroll down and add a message for the person who will be passing on 
your Introduction. 
 
 It’s required to add a note here (see Figure 5-4), so the facilitator (the 
person who receives this Introduction request from you) knows why 
you want to reach the other party. After all, this facilitator is going to 
vouch for you when he sends this request to the intended party, so the 
more information you give, the better. (See the preceding section, 
“Approaching each party,” for more about writing this message.)
 
5. Click the Send button to send the request.
 
 You see a green confirmation message as you’re taken back to your main 
LinkedIn page, and your first-degree connection will receive this 
Introduction request in his LinkedIn Inbox. 
 
 After that, your facilitator friend will accept or decline your request, and 
you’ll get a notification about the facilitator’s decision.

an Intro-
duction. 
 
 
You may want to send an e-mail to your facilitator friend first before starting 
the Request for Introduction, especially if you think he may not want to 
forward your request or the intended recipient may be too busy to receive 
an Introduction request. 
Sending InMail
If you’re looking to connect with someone right away and you don’t have an 
immediate or secondary connection with someone, you can use a LinkedIn 
feature called InMail to send a message directly to another LinkedIn member 
without anyone else getting involved. 
 
This feature is currently available to paid members of LinkedIn who have 
InMail credits available. If you’re using a free account, you would have to 
pay for individual InMail credits to reach other members through InMail. 
Consult the LinkedIn Help section for more information (http://linkedin.
custhelp.com/). 
InMail is basically a private e-mail message that enables you to reach other 
members, but it protects those members’ privacy and e-mail address infor-
mation. If your message is accepted, you will see the other party’s name and 
e-mail address, and you can communicate further. (In some cases, you see 
only the other person’s professional headline first, and then you see the 
person’s name after he or she accepts the InMail message)

88
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
When you’re ready to send someone an InMail, just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to LinkedIn, search for the person you’d like to meet.
 
 You can use the Search box in the top-right corner of any LinkedIn page, 
or you can click on your Connections and search your friend’s networks. 
(Chapter 4 has all sorts of details for you about searching LinkedIn.)
 
2. From the list of search results, click the name of the person you want 
to contact. (If you didn’t find the person you’re looking for, try 
another search.)
 
 You’re taken to the person’s profile page.
 
3. Click the link that says Send InMail. 
 
 For example, suppose that I want to connect with Lynn Dralle, the Queen 
of Auctions, who can not only teach you how to sell on eBay, but sells 
over $100,000 a year in antiques and collectibles herself. When I look at 
her profile (see Figure 5-5), I see the Send InMail link, which means she 
is open to receiving InMail. I would click the Send InMail link to send her 
a message.
 
 Now you can start filling out the Compose Your Message form. 
 
4. Select or deselect the Include My Contact Information check box, 
depending on your preference. 
 
 You’re asked whether to provide contact information that your recipient 
can use to contact you, in the form of e-mail and/or a phone number. 
Simply select the Include My Contact Information check box (as shown 
in Figure 5-6) if you want to send contact information.

Figure 5-6: 
Compose 
your InMail 
message.
 
 
5. Complete the Category, Subject, and Salutation fields and then enter a 
message in the box provided. 
 
 Your Salutation options are these: Dear Name, Hi Name, Name, or no 
salutation. As with an Introduction, keep your message focused on 
why you would like to talk with this person, and/or what information 
you were hoping to exchange. (The earlier section, “Approaching each 
party in the Introduction,” contains advice about writing to an intended 
recipient that applies to InMail messages as well.) If you look at Figure 
5-6, you can see how many InMail credits you have — you need at least 
one to send this message.
 
6. When you’re ready, click the Send button to send off your InMail. 
 
 Your recipient receives this InMail in his LinkedIn Inbox and can decide 
whether to accept it. If your message is accepted, it’s up to the recipient 
to contact you in return. Be patient. While you’re waiting, I recommend a 
game of Connect Four or Internet Chess.
Managing Introduction Requests
What if someone in your network is looking for your help to meet someone 
in your network? You can facilitate the introduction between your LinkedIn 

90
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
first-degree connections. Now that your reputation is on the line too, you 
should spend some time thinking about and processing any and all 
Introduction requests that come your way. 
You really have only two options for handling an Introduction request:
 
 Accept it and forward it on to the party it’s intended for.
 
 Decline it (politely!).
I cover these two options in more detail in the following sections. 
 
However you decide to handle the request, keep these tips in mind: 
 
 Act or reply quickly. The reason LinkedIn works so well is that 
people are active with their networks and build upon their profile by 
answering questions, meeting new people, or joining groups. When 
you get an Introduction request, you should either act on it or respond 
to the person with the reason why you won’t act on it. Ignoring it is 
not a productive use of the LinkedIn system and makes you look very 
unprofessional.
 
 Don’t be afraid to ask for clarification. Sometimes you might need 
someone to remind you exactly how you’re connected with her. 
Hopefully, in the note you get from this person, she includes some 
reminder or thought that helps you place her. If not, don’t be afraid to 
shoot back a message and ask for clarification or a gentle reminder. 
 
 Read your friend’s request before forwarding. Chances are good that 
the person to whom you forward this request might come back to you 
and ask, “Hey, why did I get this?” or “What do you really think about 
this person?” If you don’t know the details of your friend’s request, the 
intended party may think you’re a quick rubber-stamper who sends stuff 
off without offering to screen anything, and that lowers this person’s 
impression of you. 
Accepting requests and forwarding 
the Introduction
When you’re ready to accept your friend’s request and forward her 
Introduction, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the plus (+) sign next to the Inbox link in the left navigation 
menu. 
 
 This expands your Inbox options, allowing you to go straight to your 
Messages, InMail, Introductions, Invitations, and so on. 

91
 Chapter 5: Managing Introductions and InMail
 
2. Click the Introductions link to see your requests. 
 
 This brings up your Introductions page, as shown in Figure 5-7. Here you 
can see Introduction requests from fellow members (Received 
Introductions), as well as the results from Introductions you have 
requested yourself (Sent Introductions).
 
 In Figure 5-7, you can see some little flags. A small yellow flag means the 
message hasn’t been addressed yet.
 
3. In the Subject column, click the link of the request you’re evaluating. 
 
 In this example, I clicked Hello! from David Nakayama, a friend of mine 
who’s a comic book artist. Doing so brings up the Introduction request, 
as shown in Figure 5-8. 
 
 Read the full text before acting on the request. Don’t just skim it — you 
might miss an important detail. 
 
4. If you accept the request, click the Forward Introduction button. 
 
 A new window opens where you can compose your message to the 
recipient, as shown in Figure 5-9. The text box in the middle contains the 
note from your friend to you, which you can supplement with a note to 
the intended recipient. Be sure to add your own comments, like I did in 
Figure 5-9, to help connect the two people properly. 
 
5. Click the Forward Message button to send the request.

 In this case, Joe Benitez will get the Introduction request from me on 
behalf of David Nakayama. David will never see Joe’s direct e-mail 
address, and Joe can decide whether or not to reach out to David and 
form a connection. 
Gracefully declining requests
There may come a point when you receive an Introduction request that you 
just don’t feel comfortable sending on to the recipient. Perhaps you don’t 
know enough about your contact who made the request, or you’re unclear 
about that person’s true motivations. Or maybe your connection with the 
recipient isn’t at the stage where you feel you can introduce other people to 
this person. 
Whatever the reason, the best response is simply to gracefully decline the 
request. Here are some tips on how to respond: 
 
 It’s not you, it’s me. The most common way to decline is to simply 
inform the initial contact that you’re not that deeply connected with the 
intended recipient, and you really don’t feel comfortable passing on a 
request to someone who isn’t a strong contact. Often, you might have 
first-degree connections in your network that are “weak links” or people 
who you’re acquainted with but aren’t particularly close to or tight with. 
 
 The recipient doesn’t respond well to this approach. You can respond 
that you know the intended recipient, and you know what she’s going 
to say, either from past requests or other experiences with that person. 
Because you know or feel that the intended recipient wouldn’t be 
interested, you would rather not waste anyone’s time in sending on 
the request. 
 
 I just don’t feel comfortable passing the request along. It’s best to be 
honest and simply state that you don’t feel right passing on the request 
you’ve received. After all, if the original contact doesn’t understand 
your hesitation, he’ll probably keep asking, and LinkedIn will want you 
to follow up on any unresolved Introduction. Just as in life, honesty is 
usually the best policy. 
 
 I think your request needs work. Because you’re vouching for this 
person, you don’t want to pass along a shoddy or questionable request 
that could reflect badly on you. In this case, simply respond that you 
think the request needs to be reworded or clarified, and offer concrete 
suggestions on what should be said as well as what requests you feel 
comfortable forwarding. 
When you’re ready to decline the request, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the + sign next to the Inbox link in the left navigation menu. 
 
 More links show up under the Inbox link.

94
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
2. Click the Introductions link and then click the subject line of the 
request. 
 
 You see the Introduction request.
 
3. Click the Decline to Forward button. 
 
 The Not Interested in Forwarding page appears, as shown in Figure 5-10. 
 
4. Pick a reason for not forwarding the request, or click the Other option 
and write a message why you’re declining to forward. 
 
 If you pick any of the main options, like “I know X, and this message is 
not a good fit,” you don’t have to provide any additional message. 
Unless one of these options really states your case, you should probably 
select Other and write a custom message (or send a separate e-mail 
message giving more information). 
 
5. Click the Send button to decline the request. 
 
 The original contact receives an e-mail and a message in his LinkedIn 
inbox.

M
aybe by now you’ve signed onto LinkedIn, created your profile, 
searched through the network, and started inviting people to connect 
to you, and you’re wondering, what’s next? You certainly shouldn’t be sitting 
around on your hands, waiting for responses to your Invitations. LinkedIn is 
designed to open doors to opportunities using the professional relationships 
you already have (and, with luck, by creating new ones). The best use of it, 
therefore, is to capture as much of your professional network as possible in 
the form of first-degree connections to your LinkedIn network so that you can 
discover those inside leads, as well as those friends of friends who can help 
you out. 
In this chapter, I discuss how you can grow your LinkedIn network. You find 
out some guidelines to keep in mind when growing your network. I also cover 
various search tools for you to use to stay on top of LinkedIn’s growing 
membership and how others may relate to you.
Of course, to expand your network, you need to know how to send 
Invitations, as well as how to attract LinkedIn members and your contacts 
who haven’t yet taken the plunge into LinkedIn membership, so you find all 
that out here, too. And finally, this chapter helps you deal with the etiquette 
of accepting or declining Invitations that you receive, and shows you how to 
remove connections that you no longer want to keep in your network. 

96
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
Building a Meaningful Network
When you build a house, you start with some blueprints. When you start an 
organization, you usually have some sort of mission statement or guiding 
principles. Likewise, when you start to grow your LinkedIn network, you 
should keep in mind some of the keys to having and growing your own 
professional network. These guiding principles will help you make decisions 
regarding whom to invite to your network, whom to search for and introduce 
yourself to, and how much time to spend on LinkedIn. 
You may have heard of the highly popular social networking sites such as 
Facebook and MySpace. LinkedIn is different from these sites because it 
focuses on business networking in a professional manner, rather than 
encourage users to post pictures of their latest beach party. The best use of 
LinkedIn involves maintaining a professional network of connections, not 
sending someone a Super Hug. 
That said, there is a lot of variety in the types of networks that people main-
tain on LinkedIn, and much of that has to do with each person’s definition of 
a meaningful network. Some of the key elements of a “meaningful” network 
are the following: 
 
 Quality versus quantity: As mentioned in Chapter 1, some people use 
LinkedIn with the goal of gaining the highest number of connections 
possible, thereby emphasizing quantity over the quality of their 
LinkedIn connections. Those people are typically referred to as LinkedIn 
Open Networkers, or LIONs. At the other end of the spectrum are people 
who use LinkedIn only to keep their closest, most tightly knit connec-
tions together without striving to enlarge their network. Most people fall 
somewhere in between these two aims, and the question of whether 
you’re after quality or quantity is something to keep in mind every time 
you look to invite someone. LinkedIn strongly recommends that you 
should connect only with people you know, so its advice is to stick to 
quality connections. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help 
you figure out your purpose:
 
• Are you looking to manage a network of only people you personally 
know?
 
• Are you looking to manage a network of people you know or who 
might help you find new opportunities in a specific industry? 
 
• Are you looking to maximize your chances of being able to reach 
someone with a new opportunity or job offering, regardless of 
personal interaction?

97
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
 
 Depth versus breadth: Some people want to focus on building a network 
of only the most relevant or new connections — people from their cur-
rent job or industry who could play a role in one’s professional develop-
ment in that particular industry. Other people like to include a wide 
diversity of connections that include anyone they have ever profession-
ally interacted with, whether through work, education, or any kind of 
group or association, in hopes that anyone who knows them at all can 
potentially lead to future opportunities. For these LinkedIn users, it 
doesn’t matter that most of the people in their network don’t know 99 
percent of their other connections. Most people fall somewhere in 
between these two poles, but lean toward including more people in 
their network. Here are some questions to keep in mind regarding this 
question:
 
• Are you looking to build or maintain a specific in-depth network of 
thought leaders regarding one topic, job, or industry? 
 
• Are you looking to build a broad network of connections who can 
help you with different aspects of your career or professional life? 
 
• Do you want to add only people to your network who may offer an 
immediate benefit to some aspect of your professional life, or are 
you looking to add a professional contact now and figure out later 
how that person might fit with your long-term goals?
 
 Strong versus weak link: I’m not referring to the game show “The 
Weakest Link” but rather to the strength of your connection with some-
one. Beyond the issue of quality versus quantity, you’ll want to keep 
differing levels of quality in mind. Some people invite someone after 
meeting them once at a cocktail party, hoping to strengthen the link as 
time goes on. Others work to create strong links first and then invite 
those people to connect on LinkedIn afterward. This issue comes down 
to how much you want LinkedIn itself to play a role in your business 
network’s development, meaning, do you see your LinkedIn network 
as a work in progress or as a virtual room in which to gather only your 
closest allies? Here are some questions to keep in mind: 
 
• What level of interaction needs to have occurred for you to feel 
comfortable asking someone to connect to you on LinkedIn? A 
face-to-face meeting? Phone conversations only? A stream of 
e-mails? 
 
• What length of time do you need to know someone before you feel 
that you can connect to him or her? Or, does time matter less if 
you have had a high-quality interaction just once? 
 
• Does membership in a specific group or association count as a 
good enough reference for you to add someone to your network? 
(For example, if you’ve met someone only briefly once, but he or 
she is an alumnus of your school, does that tie serve as a sufficient 
reference?)

98
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 Specific versus general goals: Some people like to maintain a strong net-
work of people mainly to talk about work and job-related issues. Other 
people like to discuss all matters relating to their network, whether it’s 
professional, personal, or social. Most people fall somewhere in 
between, and herein lies what I mean by the “purpose” of your network. 
Do you want to simply catalog your entire network, regardless of indus-
try, because LinkedIn will act as your complete contact management 
system and because you can use LinkedIn to reach different parts of 
your network at varying times? Or do you want to focus your LinkedIn 
network on a specific goal, using your profile to attract and retain the 
“right kind” of contact that furthers that goal? Here are some more ques-
tions to ask yourself:
 
• Do you have any requirements in mind for someone before you 
add them to your network? That is, are you looking to invite only 
people with certain qualities or experience?
 
• Does the way you know or met someone influence your decision to 
connect to that person on LinkedIn? 
 
• What information do you need to know about someone before you 
want to add them to your network? 
 
By the way, this has not been a quiz — there is no one right answer to any of 
these questions. It’s totally up to you to decide what you want to accomplish 
through your LinkedIn network, and how you want to go from there. Also keep 
in mind that although you may start LinkedIn with one goal in mind, as with 
most other things in life, your usage and experience may shift you to a differ-
ent way of using the site. If that happens, just go with it, as long as it fits with 
your current goals. 
Understanding Linking Strategies
After you’ve established why you want to link to other people, you can start 
looking for and reaching out to those people. In this section, I point you to a 
number of linking strategies that can help you reach your goals for your net-
work. When you started on LinkedIn, completing your profile helped you get 
your first round of connections, and you were prompted to enter whatever 
names you could remember to offer an Invitation for them to connect with 
you. Now you’re ready to generate your next round of connections, and to 
get into the habit of making this a continual process as you use the site. 
Checking for new LinkedIn members
When you fill out your LinkedIn profile, you create a the opportunity to check 
for colleagues and classmates, as well as to import any potential contact and 

99
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
invite that person to connect with you and stay in touch using LinkedIn. 
However, that search happens only after you define your profile (and when 
you update or add to your profile). After that, it’s up to you to routinely 
check the LinkedIn network to see whether there are new members on the 
site who may want to connect with you or with whom you might want to con-
nect. Fortunately, LinkedIn provides a few tools that help you quickly scan 
the system to see whether a recently joined member is a past colleague or 
classmate of yours. In addition, it never hurts to use your friends to check for 
new members, as I discuss in a little bit. 
 
Every time you send an Invitation to someone, you may see one of the follow-
ing functions pop up automatically. Feel free to click the link and take advan-
tage of the reminder to keep your network current. 
Finding newly added colleagues
If you’ve worked at least one job in a medium-size or large company, you’re 
probably familiar with the concept of the farewell lunch. The staff goes out to 
lunch, reminiscences about the good old days, and wishes the departing 
employee well as that person gives out his or her e-mail address, phone 
number, and says to keep in touch. But as time goes on, jobs change, people 
move around, and it’s easy to lose touch with that co-worker. Thankfully, 
LinkedIn allows you to stay connected regardless of moves. 
 
Sometimes people you’ve fallen out of contact with have joined LinkedIn since 
the last time you checked, so it’s important to do an occasional search to see 
whether you know any newly added colleagues.
When you want to do a search for newly added colleagues (and add them to 
your network, if you choose), just follow these steps:
 
1. While logged in to your LinkedIn account, click the Add Connections 
button below the left navigation menu.
 
 The Add Connections window opens.
 
2. Click the Colleagues tab below the Add Connections blue title bar. 
 
 The Colleagues window, shown in Figure 6-1, appears. 
 
3. Pick an employer (current or past) from the list presented.
 
 If you’ve previously looked over the list of colleagues for an employer, 
two buttons are available: Find New and View All. To check for just the 
latest additions, you want to click the yellow Find New button, as I’ve 
done under NewComix.com in Figure 6-1. If you have never checked an 
employer’s list, only one button is available for you to click, as Figure 6-1 
shows under Waterside Productions. Clicking the View All Waterside 
Productions link brings up the new colleagues list shown in Figure 6-2.

4. Go through the list of names and see if there is anyone you recognize 
or wish to connect with on LinkedIn. 
 
 You can click a name to see the person’s profile for more information. If 
you see someone you want to invite to your network, select the check 
box next to the person’s name, and it should appear in the right window, 
as shown in Figure 6-3.

 Each person on your list will receive an Invitation to join your network. 
If you don’t know or want to invite anyone on the list, click the gray I 
Don’t Know Anyone Here button to cancel the entire process. You’ll see 
up to 50 names; if you don’t see any company names on this page, it’s 
because you didn’t add any companies to your profile.
Finding newly added classmates
No matter how much time goes by since my graduation from college, I still 
remember my school years well. I met a lot of cool and interesting people, 
folks I wanted to stay in contact with because of common goals, interests, or 
experiences. As time progressed and people moved on to new lives after 
graduation, it was all too easy to lose touch and not be able to reconnect. 

102
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
Through LinkedIn, though, you can reconnect with them and maintain that 
tie through your network, no matter where anyone moves on to. For you to 
find them to begin with, of course, your former classmates have to properly 
list their dates of receiving education. And, just as with the search for former 
colleagues, it’s important to do an occasional search to see what classmates 
of yours have recently joined LinkedIn.
 
1. While logged in to your LinkedIn account, click the green Add 
Connections button below your left navigation menu.
 
 The Add Connections window opens.
 
2. Click the Classmates tab.
 
 The Classmates window appears, as shown in Figure 6-4. If it is blank, 
that is because you have not yet added any education entries to your 
profile.

you 
identified in 
your profile

window.
 
 
3. Look over the list of schools and click the name of the one you 
attended.
 
 Clicking the list brings up a list of potential classmates, as shown in 
Figure 6-5.

4. Go through the list of names to see whether you find someone you 
want to add to your network.
 
 You can view this list by graduation year only (which means you see 
only people who graduated the same year as you) or you can switch the 
view to all the years you attended the school by clicking that radio 
button. When you find someone, click the Invite link that’s on the same 
line as the person’s name (and appears in the Send Invitation column) to 
bring up an Invitation for that person, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
 Before you invite people, click their name to read their profiles and see 
what they’ve been doing. Why ask them what they’ve been doing when 
you can read it for yourself? By doing your homework first, your 
Invitation will sound more natural and be more likely to be accepted. 
 
5. Write up a personal Invitation (using the one in Figure 6-6 as an exam-
ple, if you need some ideas) and click the blue Send Invitation button.
 
 Your Invitation is sent and a page appears like the one shown in Figure 
6-7. If you want to invite more classmates, simply click the yellow Find 
Classmates button and repeat Steps 3 and 4.
 
I cover more about sending invitations later in this chapter, in the “Sending 
Connection Requests” section.

 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
 
There’s another way to keep on top of newly added colleagues and class-
mates. When you go to your LinkedIn home page, you can find a section enti-
tled Just Joined LinkedIn. This section tells you how many new colleagues 
and classmates have joined LinkedIn since the last time you logged on to the 
site. You can click the link to view the names of these people.
Browsing your connections’ networks
Although it’s helpful for LinkedIn to help you search the network, sometimes 
nothing gives as good results as some good old-fashioned investigation. From 
time to time, I like to browse the network of one of my first-degree connec-
tions to see whether he or she has a contact that should be a part of my net-
work. I don’t recommend spending a lot of your time this way, but a “spot 
check” by picking a few friends at random can yield some nice results. 
Why is this type of research effective? Lots of reasons, including these:
 
 You travel in the same circles. If someone is a part of your network, you 
know that person from a past experience, whether you worked together, 
learned together, spoke at a conference together, or lived next door to 
each other. Whatever that experience was, you and this contact spent 
time with other people, so chances are you will have shared connections 
or, better yet, you will find people in that person’s network who need to 
be a part of your network. 
 
 You may find someone newly connected. Say that you’ve already spent 
some time searching all your undergraduate alumni contacts and adding 
as many people as you could find. As time passes, someone new may 
connect to one of your friends.
 
 One effective way to keep updated about who your connections have 
recently added is to review your Network Updates (which I discuss back 
in Chapter 1). 
 
 You may recognize someone whose name you didn’t fully remember. 
Many of us have that contact whom we feel we know well, have fun talk-
ing to, and really trust, but for some reason, we can’t remember that 
person’s last name. Then, for some reason, when you search a common 
contact’s network and see the temporarily forgotten name and job title, 
you suddenly remember. Now you can invite that person to join your 
network. Another common experience is seeing a the name and job title 
of a contact whose last name changed after she got married and you 
knew her only from her former name and chosen profession. 
 
 You may see someone you’ve wanted to get to know better. Have you 
ever watched a friend talking to someone whom you wanted to add to your 
network? Maybe your friend already introduced you, so the other person 
knows your name, but you consider this person a casual acquaintance at 
best. When you see that person’s name listed in your friend’s LinkedIn net-
work, you can take the opportunity to deepen that connection. Having a 
friend in common who can recommend you can help smooth the way.

106
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
To browse the network of one of your connections, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Connections link in the expanded left navigation menu to 
bring up your network.
 
2. Click the name of a first-degree connection (or you can search for the 
name from the search box on the home page and then, on the search 
results page, click the name you want).
 
 When you have the person’s profile, look for tabs like Profile and 
Connections below the name and professional headline. If you don’t see 
a tab marked Connections, you can’t proceed with this process because 
that person has chosen to make their connection list private. If that’s 
the case, you need to select another of your first-degree connections. 
 
3. Click the Connections tab of the connection.
 
 For the example in these steps, I’ve picked a friend and associate, 
Michael Wellman, of the Comic Bug in Redondo Beach, California, and 
his connection list is shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: 
You can 
look through 
your friend’s 
network. 
 
 
4. Look through the list to see whether you’d like to send an Invitation to 
anyone and, if so, click the person’s name to pull up his or her profile.

107
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
 
 When I scan through Mike’s list, I notice that his wife, Carol Mendolsohn, 
is in his network. I spoke with her once about some questions she had 
regarding search engine optimization (SEO), so I clicked her name to 
bring up her profile, which is shown in Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9:

Click here to add a person to your network.
 
5. Click the Add Person’s Name to Your Network link, which appears at 
the top right of the page.
 
 The Invitation page appears, as shown in Figure 6-10.
 
6. Select the option that best describes your connection to this person.
 
 It’s a good idea to enter some text in the box under Include a Personal 
Note. This text customizes your Invitation and you can use it to remind 
the person of you and why you’d like to connect.
 
7. Click the blue Send button to send off the Invitation. 
Presto! You’re all done.

Sending Connection Requests
You can check out previous sections of this chapter to find out how to use 
LinkedIn to search the entire user network and find people you want to invite 
to join your personal network. In the following sections, I focus on sending 
out the Invitation, including how to go about inviting people who haven’t yet 
decided to join LinkedIn. 
Sending requests to existing members
When you’re on a LinkedIn page and spot the name of a member whom you 
want to invite to your network, you can follow these steps to send that 
person a Connection Request to add him to your network: 
 
1. Click the person’s name to go to his profile page.
 
 You might find people to invite using one of the methods described in 
the “Understanding Linking Strategies” section earlier this chapter. You 
might also find them while browsing LinkedIn Answers (which I cover in 
more detail in Chapter 7) or the Advanced People Search, which I cover 
in Chapter 4. Figure 6-11 shows the profile page of a LinkedIn member.

Click here to add a person to your network.
 
2. Click the Add Person’s Name to your Network link (where Person’s 
Name is, of course, the real name of the person you’re adding).
 
 The Invitation page appears, as shown in Figure 6-12. 
 
3. From the list of connection reasons, choose the option that best 
describes your relationship to this person.
 
 In some cases, you may have to input the person’s e-mail address to help 
prove that you actually know the person. If you select the I Don’t Know 
Person’s Name option, LinkedIn will deny the request, so keep that in 
mind. If you pick a category such as Colleague or Classmate, LinkedIn will 
display a drop-down list of options based on your profile. For example, if 
you pick Colleague, LinkedIn displays a drop-down list of your positions. 
You need to pick the position you held when you knew this person. 
 
4. Enter your Invitation text in the box that appears under Include a 
Personal Note. 
 
 I highly recommend that you compose a custom Invitation rather than use 
the standard text, “I’d like to add you to my professional network on 
LinkedIn.” In my example in Figure 6-12, I remind the person how we recently 
met, acknowledge one of his achievements, and ask him to connect.

5. Click the blue Send Invitation button to send the Invitation.
 
 You will be notified by e-mail when the other party accepts your connection 
request. 
Why you shouldn’t use canned Invitations
You might be very tempted to look at the “canned” Invitation that LinkedIn dis-
plays when you go to the Invitation Request page, especially if you’re having a 
rough or busy day, and just send off the Invitation without adding to or replac-
ing the canned Invitation with some custom text. We all have things to do and 
goals to accomplish, so stopping to write a note for each Invitation may seem 
tedious. However, it’s becoming increasingly important, for the following rea-
sons, to replace that text with something that speaks to the recipient:
 
 The other person may not remember you. Quite simply, your recipient may 
take one look at your name, see no additional information in the note that 
accompanied it, and think, “Who is that guy (or gal)?” A few may click your 
name to read your profile and try to figure it out, but most people are busy 
and won’t take the time to investigate. They are likely to ignore your request.
 
 The other person could report you as someone they don’t know. Having 
someone ignore your request is not the worst possibility. The worst thing 
pertains to a button that recipients of the Invitation see, the I Don’t Know 
This Person button. If several people click this button from an Invitation 

111
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
you’ve sent, LinkedIn will consider you a spammer and will suspend and 
possibly even remove your profile and account from the site!
 
 You offer no motivation for a mutually beneficial relationship. When 
people get an Invitation request, they understand pretty clearly that you 
want something from them, whether it’s access to them or to their net-
work. If you’ve sent a canned Invitation, what they can’t answer is the 
question, “What is in it for me?” A canned Invitation gives no motivation 
for or potential benefit of being connected to you. A custom note 
explaining that you’d love to swap resources or introduce them to 
others is usually enough to encourage an acceptance. 
 
 A canned Invite implies you don’t care. Some people will look at your 
Invitation request with a canned Invitation and think, “This person 
doesn’t have 30 to 60 seconds to write a quick note introducing herself? 
She must not think much of me.” That impression will quickly kill your 
chances of getting more connections. 
Sending requests to nonmembers
Only members of LinkedIn can be part of anyone’s network. Therefore, if you 
want to send a Connection Request to someone who has not yet joined 
LinkedIn, you must invite that person to create a LinkedIn account first. To 
do so, you can either send your invitee an e-mail directly, asking him or her 
to join, or you can use a LinkedIn function that generates the e-mail Invitation 
that includes a link to join LinkedIn. 
Either way, you need to have the nonmember’s e-mail address, and you’ll 
probably have to provide your invitee with some incentive by offering rea-
sons to take advantage of LinkedIn and create an account. (I give you some 
tips for doing that in the next section of this chapter.) 
When you’re ready to send your request using LinkedIn, just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Add Connections button below the left navigation menu.
 
 The Add Connections window appears. 
 
2. Fill in the names and e-mail addresses of the people you want to invite 
to LinkedIn in the boxes provided, as shown in Figure 6-13. 
 
3. Click the link Edit/Preview Invitation Text link to bring up a preview 
pane within the same page.
 
4. Write a custom Invitation in the text box provided 
 
 You’ll send this Invitation to everyone on your list.

5. Click the blue Send Invitation button. 
 
 You’re returned to the Add Connections page, where you see a green 
confirmation message on the screen. From here, you can invite addi-
tional people to your network.
Communicating the value 
of joining LinkedIn
Okay, you want to add some people to your LinkedIn network, but they 
haven’t yet taken the plunge of signing up for the site. If you want them to 
accept your request by setting up their account, you may need to communi-
cate the value of LinkedIn to your contact. After all, recommendations are 
one of the most powerful sales tools, which is why all types of businesses — 
from e-commerce stores and retail businesses to service directories and 
social networking Web sites — use recommendations so often. 
So, how do you make the “sale”? (I use that term figuratively, of course; as 
you know, a basic LinkedIn account is free, — a feature that you should defi-
nitely not neglect to mention to your invitees!) If you send a super-long thesis 
on the merits of LinkedIn, it’ll most likely be ignored. If you send a simple 
“C’mon! You know you wanna. . . .” request, that may or may not work. (You 
know your friends better than me.) You could buy them a copy of this book, 

113
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
but that could get expensive. (But I would be thrilled! C’mon! You know you 
wanna. . . .) The simplest way is to mention some of the benefits they could 
enjoy from joining the site, such as: 
 
 LinkedIn members always stay in touch with their connections. If 
people you know move, change their e-mail address, or change jobs, you 
still have a live link to them via LinkedIn. You will always be able to see 
their new e-mail address if you’re connected (assuming that they pro-
vide it, of course). 
 
 LinkedIn members can tap into their friends’ networks for jobs or 
opportunities, now or later. Although someone may not need a job now, 
he or she will eventually need help, so why not access thousands or mil-
lions of potential leads? LinkedIn has tens of millions of members in all 
sorts of industries, and people have obtained consulting leads, contract 
jobs, new careers, and even startup venture capital or funding for a new 
film! After all, it’s all about “who you know.” 
 
 LinkedIn can help you build your own brand. LinkedIn members 
get a free profile page to build their online presence, and can to link to 
up to three of their own Web sites, such as a blog, personal Web site, 
or e-commerce store. The search engines love LinkedIn pages, which 
have high page rankings — and this can only be a boost to your online 
identity. 
 
 LinkedIn can help you do all sorts of research. You might need to know 
more about a company before an interview, or you’re looking for a cer-
tain person to help your business, or you’re curious what people’s opin-
ions would be regarding an idea you have. LinkedIn is a great resource 
in all these situations. You can use LinkedIn to get free advice and infor-
mation, all from the comfort of your own computer.
 
 A basic LinkedIn account is free, and joining LinkedIn is easy. There 
are a lot of misconceptions that users have to pay a monthly fee or 
spend a lot of time updating their LinkedIn profiles. Simply remind 
people that joining is free, and after they set up their profiles, LinkedIn is 
designed to take up very little of their time to keep an active profile and 
get some usefulness from having an account there. 
Removing people from your network
There may come a time when you feel you need to remove someone from 
your network. Perhaps you added the person in haste, or he or she repeat-
edly asks you for favors or Introduction requests, or sends messages that 
you don’t want to respond to. Not to worry — you’re not doomed to suffer 
forever; you can simply remove the connection. When you do so, that person 
can no longer view your network or send you messages, unless he or she 
pays to send you an InMail message. 

114
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
To remove a connection from your network, just follow these steps: 
 
1. While logged in to your LinkedIn account, click the Connections 
link in the expanded left navigation menu to bring up your list 
of connections. 
 
2. Click the Remove Connections link that appears on the right side of 
the page, as shown in Figure 6-14.

Accepting Invitations (or 
Gracefully Declining)
In this chapter, I talk a lot about how and why you might send out Invitations 
and add people to your network, and even covered what to do when you 
need to remove someone from your network. But what about the flip side of 
that coin — that is, being the invitee? In this section, I offer some guidance on 
what to do when you’re faced with an Invitation and you have to decide 
whether to happily accept or gracefully decline it. 
When you receive an Invitation to join someone’s network of connections and 
you’re not whether to accept or decline the Invitation, ask yourself these 
questions:
 
 How well do you know this person? With any luck, the inviter has 
included a custom message clueing you in to who he or she is, in case 
you don’t remember. You can, of course, click their name to read their 
profile, which usually helps in triggering your memory. If this is some-
body you don’t know or remember, you probably don’t want to add him 
to your network just yet. If you do know him, you need to consider 
whether he’s worth adding to your network. 
 
 Does this person fit with the goals of your network? As I mention early 
in this chapter, it’s easier to put together a network when you’ve estab-
lished a sense of the purpose you want it to serve. When you’re looking 
at this Invitation, simply ask yourself, “Does accepting this Invitation 
help further my goals?” 
 
 Is this someone you want to communicate with and include in your 
network? If you don’t like someone or don’t want to do business with 
them, you should certainly not feel obligated to accept his or her 
Invitation. Keep in mind that these people will have access to your net-
work and can hit you up with Introduction and Recommendation 
requests (see Chapters 5 and 8, respectively). 
If you’re thinking of declining an Invitation, here are some tips to help you do 
so gracefully: 
 
 Respond quickly. If you wait to respond to the Invitation, and then 
decide to go ahead and decline the invite, the other person may be even 
more offended and confused. Respond quickly so that this issue isn’t 
hanging over anyone’s head. 

117
 Chapter 6: Growing Your Network
 
 If necessary, ask for more information. If you feel uncomfortable 
because you don’t know the person well but want to consider the invita-
tion before you decline, respond with a request for more information, 
such as, “I appreciate your interest, but I am having trouble placing our 
previous meetings. What is your specific interest in connecting with me 
on LinkedIn? Please let me know how we know each other and what your 
goals are for LinkedIn. Thanks again.” 
 
 Respond politely but with a firm no. You can simply write something 
along the lines of, “Thank you for your interest; I appreciate your eager-
ness. Unfortunately, since I am not familiar with you, I am not interested 
in connecting with you on LinkedIn just yet.” Then, if you want, you can 
spell out the terms on which you may be interested in connecting, such 
as if the opportunity ever arises to get to know the person better or if he 
or she is referred to you by a friend.

Using LinkedIn Answers

 Posting your question on LinkedIn
 Following up with your question 
I
f you believe the phrase, “Knowledge is power,” you’ll find the LinkedIn 
Answers feature to be a very powerful tool. Imagine being able to ask your 
network or the entire LinkedIn network a question and draw on the expertise 
and experiences of a potential pool of tens of millions of users. This is exactly 
what LinkedIn Answers was designed for, and it’s a free service available to 
any LinkedIn user!
In this chapter, I discuss how to use LinkedIn Answers properly. I start by 
helping you find questions you can answer, and then I walk you through how 
to put together an answer and post it on the LinkedIn Answers site. Then, 
I shift gears and focus on the ability to ask questions. You find out how to 
phrase your question, how to determine what kind of information is the best 
to request, and then how to post your question on the site. 
How LinkedIn Helps You Find 
Answers to Your Questions
The goal of LinkedIn Answers is to allow professionals to exchange expertise. 
Now, upon hearing that, your first question may be: “Well, what kind of ques-
tion can I ask on LinkedIn Answers?” Glad you asked! LinkedIn members have 
a lot of personal and professional experiences to share, so there’s no end to 
the questions you can pose. Plus the network makes it easy to organize and 
gather information. 

120
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
You should NOT use LinkedIn Answers to simply forge connections, create 
a personal advertisement, or run a group poll. Users can flag inappropriate 
questions, which moderators can then review and possibly remove from the 
site. If your questions keep getting flagged, you won’t be able to use this fea-
ture anymore. Inappropriate questions include asking for direct contact, post-
ing just an advertisement for your business, or posting inappropriate content 
not suitable for public viewing. 
Therefore, to encourage an orderly and productive exchange, LinkedIn orga-
nizes questions into the following categories:
 
 Administration: Do you have questions about rules and regulations? Are 
you putting together your small business benefits package? Or are you 
planning to move your business to a bigger building and need some ideas 
on how to pick the right facility? With topics that run from business insur-
ance to purchasing and facilities management, you can post a question on 
LinkedIn and draw on expertise from company administrators, commer-
cial real estate agents, and even customer service professionals. 
 
 Business Operations: From supply chain and inventory issues to manu-
facturing, packaging, and quality management concerns, this category is 
your area to ask operations-related questions and read questions from 
other like-minded professionals, whether it’s project management issues 
or something on your shop floor. 
 
 Business Travel: Because many professionals still have to travel for 
their jobs or personal enjoyment, this category is dedicated to letting 
you ask all those questions about air travel, hotels, car rentals, and the 
different travel tools out there. Ask a question about the best place to 
host a business dinner in a certain city, or how people save money while 
booking travel on the Internet. 
 
 Career and Education: Because lifelong learning and the eternal job 
search are two important benefits of using LinkedIn, this category is 
dedicated to questions for everything from resume writing, professional 
networks, and job searches to getting certifications and licenses, coach-
ing, freelancing, and contracting. 
 
 Conferences and Event Planning: Before you rack your brain figuring 
out how to plan the perfect conference or event for your company, you 
can use LinkedIn to ask others about this topic. This category is dedi-
cated to questions regarding conference planning, conference venues, 
and event marketing and promotions. So, if you need help picking the 
right facility to accommodate your staff, or how to get the word out 
about your software development seminars, this is the place to do so! 
 
 Finance and Accounting: From Accounting 101 to Risk Management, 
anything you were afraid to ask your Microeconomics Professor is fair 
game here. There are subsections devoted to corporate debt and taxes, 
budgeting, and mergers and acquisitions, and your questions could be 
answered by an entrepreneur or a CFO from a Fortune 500 company. 

121
 Chapter 7: Using LinkedIn Answers
 
 Financial Markets: This isn’t the place to hope to find that next hot 
stock tip, but it is a great place to ask questions about different markets 
like the bond markets, commodity markets, currency, derivatives, and, 
of course, equity markets. If futures and options make your head spin, 
you may find some guidance here.
 
 Just like any other category, the answers posted in the Financial Markets 
category are the opinions of the poster only and should not be assumed 
as fact. Check with your financial expert or attorney before acting on 
any advice you receive here. 
 
 Government: When you deal with government entities, each country 
has their own guidelines. Therefore, why not bounce some questions off 
folks who work in those arenas and benefit from their experience and 
guidance? Unclear about government policy? Ask a question and see 
whether a fellow LinkedIn member has dealt with it or can point you to 
the person, document, or Web site that can help.
 
 Hiring and Human Resources: While Donald Trump can make HR look 
easy with two famous words, the world of Human Resources is full of 
staffing, recruiting, policies, and benefits rules and regulations that are 
always changing and sometimes complex. Use the Answers section to 
find someone who knows his way around a 401k plan so you can focus 
on your main job. 
 
 International: Thinking of doing business outside your country? Reach 
out with LinkedIn to ask questions of people who live in your target 
areas. Or ask questions of fellow countrymen (and women) who have 
entered those new areas, and find out what works and what doesn’t. 
From customs to exporting to outsourcing, if you need to understand 
the ins and outs of International Law you can get all the answers you 
need in this category. 
 
 Law and Legal: No matter what you do in the business world (not to 
mention the real world), you’re bound to have a legal question sooner 
rather than later. Whether it concerns corporate, tax, or employment/
labor laws, see what fellow business owners or legal experts have to say 
about your legal question.
 
 Management: When you’re the boss, or running your own division, tap 
the expertise of fellow managers when you’re stuck with a question or 
curious about some of the newest trends or practices. This category has 
subsections devoted to labor relations, business analytics, and organiza-
tional development. When you have a planning or governance question, 
why not poll the community and see what other leaders have to say. 
 
 Marketing and Sales: Still trying to sell that refrigerator to someone in 
the Arctic Circle? From advertising to business development to writing 
and sales, you can pose your question to a potential pool of millions of 
eager networkers and gain insight, anecdotes, and some valuable advice 
from marketers, salespeople, and management who may not share the 
same product line, but probably have faced the same issues.

Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 Non-Profit: When you deal with non-profit entities, there are plenty of 
rules about what the organization can and cannot do with their funds. 
Therefore, this category is dedicated to answering your questions about 
topics like fundraising, managing a non-profit organization, and philan-
thropy, as well as the growing area of social entrepreneurship. If you’ve 
got a question about innovative ways to have a fundraiser event, filing 
for your 501c3 government status with the IRS, or how you can encour-
age overseas entrepreneurs with small micro-loans, you can post some-
thing in this section. 
 
 Personal Finance: What if you have a question about your bank 
account, your investments, or your retirement goals? You can pose a 
question on anything from wealth management to debt management, 
and odds are good that, regardless of your current status, there are 
LinkedIn members who can relate and share some advice or stories.  
 
 Product Management: This is probably one of the most exciting catego-
ries. This category is presented to a worldwide audience, and you can 
now benefit from the ideas, opinions, and perspectives of potential cus-
tomers and business partners. I profile one company who used this cat-
egory for market research (see the sidebar “How LinkedIn made Mahalo 
a better search engine” later in the chapter), but you can also get advice 
on everything from positioning to pricing. 
 
 Professional Development: As you grow in your career, your success 
will partially be determined by the amount of lifetime learning and skills 
development you undergo as you do your job. You have to grow your 
skills to keep up with new technology and new processes, and this 
category is dedicated to help you with topics like career management, 
ethics, professional books, communications and public speaking, and 
professional organizations. 
 
 Startups and Small Businesses: The life of an entrepreneur can feel 
lonely sometimes, but now with millions of entrepreneurs all looking for 
the next step, you have an audience to pose questions on a wide range 
of issues from your business plan and incorporation steps to everyday 
small business concerns. 
 
 Sustainability: A key concern for almost every business is how that busi-
ness deals with their energy usage and how the company affects the envi-
ronment. This category is dedicated to handling questions regarding energy 
and development, green business, and green eco-friendly products. If you 
are wondering about such concepts as carbon footprints, offset credits, or 
alternative energy, this is the category to post your question. 
 
 Technology: With the ever-changing world of technology, you need to 
be able to get information fast without scratching your head over how to 
use the newest gee-whiz device in your business. You can post a ques-
tion or share your knowledge about the newest, latest, and greatest soft-
ware development techniques, Internet and e-commerce tips, blogging 
advice. You can even gain insight into ever-changing areas like biotech-
nology and wireless communications.

 Chapter 7: Using LinkedIn Answers
 
 Using LinkedIn: As LinkedIn develops and adds new functionality (and 
users), it’s great to have a place where new members can ask questions. 
Questions posted here are typically answered by established members 
who have clicked and connected their way around LinkedIn and can 
offer friendly guidance to those just starting out. 
Finding Questions to Answer
When you’re ready to contribute some knowledge, you can start by check-
ing out the LinkedIn Answers home page. Click the Answers link from the top 
menu on any LinkedIn page to get to the Answers home page. (See Figure 
7-1.) This is the hub for LinkedIn Answers. 
 
Figure 7-1: 
Get all your 
questions 
answered 
with 
LinkedIn 
Answers!
 
When you go to find a question to answer, you have several ways to search 
for one that’s right for you: 
 
 Browse the Open Questions section. You can click the Answer 
Questions tab and browse through all the current open questions, with 
the default sort being questions from people in your LinkedIn network.

124
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 Browse by category. You can browse through the categories listed on 
the Answers home page and go through subcategories until you find a 
question that’s right up your alley.
 
 Each category has its own RSS feed, which you can use to monitor cate-
gories in your RSS reader or personalized home page such as My Yahoo! 
or iGoogle. You can find out more about RSS by searching online, or you 
can get more in-depth information about how to subscribe to RSS feeds 
(a popular activity when reading blogs) in Blogging For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition by Susannah Gardner and Shane Birley, or Syndicating Web Sites 
with RSS Feeds For Dummies by Ellen Finkelstein (both published by 
Wiley).
 
 Use Advanced Answers Search. You can click the Advanced Answers 
Search tab and search through the Answers database (see Figure 7-2). 
Based on the criteria you enter on the search page, you can limit your-
self to a specific category, or you can go after completely unanswered 
questions.
 
Figure 7-2:

 Chapter 7: Using LinkedIn Answers
Answering a Question
As you go through LinkedIn Answers, you may see a question that you would 
love to contribute an answer to, whether it’s to help someone avoid the same 
mistake you made about something, or a topic you enjoy discussing. Perhaps 
you want to share your knowledge, hoping the person who posed the ques-
tion will want to work with you further on their problem. Whatever the 
reason, when you are ready to answer a question, just follow these steps:
 
1. Locate a question you can answer. Click Answers on the top menu of 
the home page to get to the main Answers page, as shown in Figure 
7-1 in the previous section.
 
2. Click the Answer Questions tab to browse the categories of open 
questions.
 
 You see an Open Questions list, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
Figure 7-3:

3. Click a category name in the pane on the right. 
 
 This step narrows down the Open Questions list. Suppose you choose 
the Startups and Small Businesses category. You see the Open 
Questions list for that category, as shown in Figure 7-4. You also see a 
new pane of sub-categories on the right.

6. Click the Answer button to start preparing your response.
 
 The Your Answer form smoothly pops open right in the middle of the 
page you’re looking at, like in Figure 7-6. How’s that for sleek?
 
Figure 7-6: 
Type your 
answer in 
the box 
provided.
 
 
 If you don’t see the Answer button, it could be that this question has 
been closed by the person who posted the question, meaning that 
person isn’t looking for any more answers to this question. It could also 
be that the question automatically closed after seven days of being on 
LinkedIn. You can only contribute to open questions.
 
7. Type your response in the Your Answer text box. 
 
 Additionally, you can enter Web sites that are part of your answer, into 
the boxes provided. You can also suggest up to three experts who could 
further expand on your answer. (See the Tip right after these steps for 
more info on this.) 
 
8. When you have your answer ready, click the Submit button to send it in. 
 
 You’re taken back to the Question posting page, but now, your answer 
is posted along with any other answers given already. The person who 
posted the question will be notified that a new answer has been posted. 
 
If you feel like you can’t provide a quality answer, but you know someone 
who should be able to give an expert answer, click the Select Experts button 
in the Your Answer form. This opens up a window (Figure 7-7 shows an 
example), where you can pick up to three people from your network by click-
ing the Select Experts button. In addition, you can add a note in the About the 
Expert(s) field, to let the question owner know why you think your suggested 
expert is qualified to answer this question. You can also select the check box 
to write a private note to the person who posted the question.

Asking a Question
Technology can be overwhelming. For example, has your boss ever asked 
you to figure out how to set up something for the business like an RSS feed? 
(And your first question was something like “What the heck is an RSS feed?”) 
Imagine that you can put the question to your connections and the rest of the 
LinkedIn network, drawing from the knowledge of a potential pool of up to 
tens of millions of professionals. Whether it’s a question pertaining to what 
you do, what you’re planning to start, or something that you need some fresh 
insight on, LinkedIn allows you to post your question to be answered by the 
community.
Your LinkedIn question is available for up to seven days from the time you 
post your question on the site. You can always reopen your question later for 
more answers, but typically one week is enough for members of the commu-
nity to start responding. Sometimes, a question gets anywhere from one to 
five responses. You might get anywhere from 10 to 20 answers for a popular 
question, while others may get 30, 50, 70, or more answers if lots of people 
have something to say. 

129
 Chapter 7: Using LinkedIn Answers
The kinds of questions to ask
Now, you don’t have to ask a giant question (like Jason Calacanis did in the 
sidebar “How LinkedIn made Mahalo a better search engine”) but LinkedIn 
Answers are more useful to you if you think about the kind of question you 
want to ask and make sure it’s something appropriate that can be answered 
by the community you’re posting the question to. 
Here are some questions to ask yourself before you . . . well, ask a question 
on LinkedIn Answers:
 
 Is your question really a comment or opinion? It can be tempting to 
post an opinion, a comment, or something designed to get a response, 
but that’s not the intent of this function. Try to pose a question that can 
be answered by an expert.
 
 Is your question non-trivial or useful? Remember, the goal of LinkedIn 
Answers is to exchange useful information that matters to other people 
using the site. Try to keep the question focused on something business 
or professionally related. 
How LinkedIn made Mahalo 
a better search engine
Imagine you’re the head of a new human-edited 
search company called Mahalo. This was the 
case for Jason Calacanis, who started this com-
pany and built it up. He got to the point where 
he was looking for people’s opinions about 
where the company should proceed and focus. 
Therefore, he turned to LinkedIn and posted the 
following question:
 
 What would you do next if you were the 
CEO of Mahalo.com?
 
 Background:
 1. We’ve got a great team: tech, admin, 
research, and editorial.
 2. We’ve got an amazing server setup and can 
handle massive traffic.
 3. We’ve got 4,000 (Web) pages done and can 
do 500 per week.
 4. The public hs suggested links already (if 
you do a search for apple, iPhone, a car, 
or a TV show, you’ll fine some suggested 
links).
 5. Folks are not chatting on the message 
board yet.
 6. We have a very stable and robust technol-
ogy platform (MediaWiki).
 
 So, given what we’ve got . . . what would 
you do next?!?!?
What he got was 88 responses, ranging from 
thoughtful insight, in-depth advice, balanced 
critique, to even a few requests to work at 
Mahalo! Not only did Jason make his network 
aware of Mahalo, but he got a lot of valuable 
insight and some in-depth “consulting” work 
just by posting a question!

Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
 
 Is your question worded clearly? If you’re hoping for some helpful 
replies, people need to clearly understand what it is you want to know. 
You can provide additional details about your question, but make sure 
the actual question is clear, concise, and simply put. 
 
 Is your question an appropriate question? Some people try to post 
spam or generic advertising messages, or simply make negative, philo-
sophical, bizarre, or highly personal statements. Make sure that this 
question is something you would feel comfortable asking of a person in a 
networking group or a fellow colleague. 
 
LinkedIn prohibits using the Answers page for posting jobs, announcing your 
job search, or openly requesting people to connect with you. If you post such 
things, the questions will be deleted and your account may be subject to sus-
pension or closure.
Getting the most and best responses
After you come up with your question, take a moment to consider the best 
way to present your question, so as many people as possible provide useful 
responses for you. 
 
 Provide as much detail as you can. After you pose your question, you 
can (and should) fill out a details section that lets people know exactly 
what kind of answer you’re hoping to receive. Add whatever detail is 
necessary for someone to properly answer your question. Include links 
to relevant Web sites that could help answer the question. If you already 
know a part of the solution, state that in the detail section so people 
don’t waste their time answering something you’ve already figured out. 
Also be sure to provide clarification if people ask for it. If you need to 
know more about how to clarify your question, see the section, “Adding 
clarification to a posted question” later in this chapter. 
 
 Use the right keywords in your question. As LinkedIn Answers contin-
ues to grow and expand, more people are using the search engine to find 
questions to answer instead of browsing open questions or categories. 
Therefore, if you need an expert in a certain subject matter, make sure 
the right keywords of that subject are in the question so it shows up in 
search results. 
 
 Use the right category(ies) for your question. Since many people search 
LinkedIn Answers by category, it is important to pick the right category 
for your question. Go through the different categories, see what previ-
ous questions match your question the best, and keep in mind that you 
can assign up to two categories per question, in case you need informa-
tion that doesn’t fit neatly into one specific category. 

131
 Chapter 7: Using LinkedIn Answers
 
 Keep your question as simple as possible. It can be tempting to get on a 
roll and start asking multiple questions that seem related in one posting. 
If people see a massive or highly complex question being asked, they 
typically are more reluctant to answer it, or they may answer a minor 
question and ignore the major one you really wanted an answer for. 
 
 Engage your audience. Sometimes, the point of your question is to make 
your audience members think about a topic and share their opinions or 
advice in that situation. Therefore, provide some focus to your question 
but leave it open-ended (meaning a question that cannot be answered in 
a few words) to generate different perspectives when people answer your 
question. (For example, “How would you do X in this situation?”)
 
 Keep your question clean and readable. Nothing can distract your 
audience quite like an obvious spelling or grammatical error. Before you 
post your question, take a minute or two to make sure the question and 
detail sections flow and are visually clean. Reword your question if nec-
essary to make that first sentence as logical as possible to anyone who 
would read it.
The 20-year-old question — and 
12 LinkedIn Answers
Tom Clifford is an award-winning corporate 
filmmaker who goes by the moniker “Director 
Tom.” For over 20 years, Director Tom has 
helped companies large and small tell their sto-
ries through documentary videos. These videos 
relate the purpose of their companies, and Tom 
makes sure the videos are “energetic, engag-
ing, compelling, meaningful and authentic.” 
On a guest blog entry, Clifford relates one 
aspect of his career: “No one has ever success-
fully answered a question I’ve been seeking in 
over 20 years. So, I asked the folks on LinkedIn 
for their thoughts.” Clifford posted the following 
question on LinkedIn Answers: 
 
 ROI Using Corporate Videos?
 
 Is there a way to measure or express the 
return on investment with corporate videos 
. . . financial or otherwise?
 
 My experience has taught me that the ROI 
on a video is easier to calculate after it is 
produced vs. before production begins . . . 
especially for non-commercial productions 
like raising awareness of issues or corpo-
rate culture and values.
 
 Perhaps, in a way, this is an unanswerable 
question. But, clearly, the corporate video 
market is a huge industry and one that con-
tinues to expand yearly.
 
 So, how does this industry continue to 
expand without a clear model for ROI?
By posting his question to a wide audience, 
Clifford gained some fresh insights from the 
LinkedIn community. Twelve answers came 
in, each taking a different perspective. Today, 
Clifford credits his LinkedIn colleagues with 
providing him “a goldmine of information” that 
he uses in presentations about his business. 
Sometimes, all it takes is the right audience!

Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
Posting your question on 
LinkedIn Answers
Okay, you’ve thought about the right question, prepared enough detail to 
help someone prepare a good answer for your question, and now you want to 
put your question on LinkedIn. To post your question, just follow these steps:
 
1. On the LinkedIn home page, click the Answers link in the main menu 
along the top. 
 
 You’re taken to the LinkedIn Answers home page (refer to Figure 7-1 
earlier in this chapter). 
 
2. Start by clicking the Ask a Question tab to prepare your full question. 
 
 You end up at the Ask a Question page, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
 
 On the Answers home page, you can also fill in the text box under Ask 
a Question and then click Next. That would also take you to the Ask a 
Question page, and your question would already be filled in.
 
3. Type your question in the box below the Ask a Question text. 
 
4. (Optional) If you want your question to go only to designated contacts, 
select the Only Share This Question with Connections I Select check box. 
 
 Please be aware that selecting this option makes your question completely 
private and only available to your designated 1st degree connections. No 
other LinkedIn user will be able to access or answer this question. 
 
 The Only Share This Question with Connections I Select box is intended 
to relay the main question you’re asking. Don’t try to squeeze in every 
detail — you have a detail section for that information. 
 
5. Type any additional details for your question in the Add Details text 
box provided. 
 
 The Add Details box is optional, but I recommend using it to give read-
ers a more complete idea of what kind of response you’re seeking, and 
any additional information they may need to answer your question. 
 
6. Under Categorize Your Question, pick a category for your question 
and then a sub-category. 
 
 You’re presented with a list of categories, where you can assign one to 
your question. When you click the category that most represents your 
category, the box to its right may appear with sub-category options. 
Continue to select sub-categories that best represent the topic of your 
question. (You might even be able to pick a sub-sub-category in the 
rightmost box.) When you’ve selected a valid category, you see the full 
category name represented below the boxes, as shown in Figure 7-9.

 Sometimes a question overlaps categories, such as when an entrepre-
neur asks about funding strategies from mergers as well as venture 
capital. If your question applies to more than one category, you can add 
a second category to expand the readership of your question and get dif-
ferent answers. 
 
7. Select any check boxes relating to your question (regarding location 
and/or question content). 
 
 LinkedIn asks you to identify whether your question relates to a specific 
geographic location. If so, click that check box. In addition, if your ques-
tion relates to recruiting, specific promotions, or a job search, select the 
appropriate check box so LinkedIn can flag the question and display it 
appropriately. 
 
8. When you’re ready, click the Ask Question button to post your ques-
tion to LinkedIn Answers. 
 
 You see a confirmation bar (see Figure 7-10) telling you that your ques-
tion has been posted and will remain open for seven days to gather 
answers. You also see a new screen that gives you the option to send 
your question to your LinkedIn network.

9. Fill out the form to send your question to connections and then click 
the Send button, or just click the Skip link. 
 
 Click the Select Connections button to pick people from your network to 
receive a copy of your question sent to their Inbox. When you’re ready, 
click the Send button to distribute your question to your network. 
 
You can customize the subject line and details of your message before you 
send out your question. After you click the Send button or the Skip button, 
your question is posted to the community. 
The more people you send this to, the more interest and response you 
should get in your question. Balance that, though, with some consideration 
of the people in your network and send it to the people you feel it would 
be most relevant to and who would likely provide a thoughtful answer. 
Remember, though, that these will be the ONLY people who receive this 
question and can answer it, so choose your connections wisely. 
Adding clarification to a posted question
After you’ve posted your question and people have started to respond, you 
may notice some things: 
 
 You’ve thought about additional information you forgot to put in your 
post.
 
 The answers being posted aren’t targeting the correct area for your 
question.
 
 The people posting answers are asking for follow-up information. 
In any of these cases, or for whatever reason, you may need to post a clarifi-
cation to your original question. If that’s the case, just follow these steps:
 
1. On the LinkedIn home page, click Answers from the main menu. 
 
2. Click the My Q&A tab to bring up your list of questions. 
 
 When you see your list of questions, select the question you need to 
update to bring up the question details.
 
3. From the question detail page, click the link Clarify My Question to 
add any extra detail to your original question. 
 
 You cannot edit your original question, so the only way to change your 
question is to add information through clarifying your question. 
 
4. On the Clarify Your Question page, add your clarification into the text 
box provided and click the Clarify Question button to add your mes-
sage to your original question. 

136
Part II: Finding Others and Getting Connected 
Selecting a Best Answer for your question
After your question has been on LinkedIn and you start receiving responses 
from the community, at some point you should go back into your question 
and review the answers you’ve received. At this stage, LinkedIn gives you the 
option to identify the Best Answer to your question, so anyone reading your 
question in the future can understand what you felt to be the most appropri-
ate answer. 
As you scroll through the answers that people have submitted, pick the 
answer that best defines your question and assign it as a Best Answer. Doing 
this helps LinkedIn recognize experts in these different categories and can be 
your way of rewarding the person who spent time answering your question 
most effectively.  
I recommend waiting until either the question automatically closes in seven 
days or waiting until you have several great answers and you feel ready to 
close the question on your end. 
I also recommend that you select at least one Good Answer on top of the 
Best Answer. This way, you are rewarding members who took the time to 
rate your question, because this designation will show up on their profile, 
whether you rated them Best Answer or Good Answer.

Recommendations
In This Chapter

E
ndorsements and testimonials have long been a mainstay of traditional 
marketing. But really, how much value is there in reading testimonials 
on someone’s own Web site, like
“Maria is a great divorce attorney — I’d definitely use her again.”
Elizabeth T. London
or 
“Jack is a fine lobbyist — a man of impeccable character.”
Emanuel R. Seattle
Without knowing who these people are, anyone reading the testimonials 
tends to be highly skeptical about them. At the very least, the reader wants 
to know that they’re real people who have some degree of accountability for 
those endorsements.
The reader is looking for something called social validation. Basically, that’s 
just a fancy shmancy term meaning that a person feels better about his 
decision to conduct business with someone if other people in his extended 
network are pleased with that person’s work. The reader knows that people 
are putting their own reputations at stake, even if just to a small degree, by 
making a public Recommendation of another person.

140
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
As this chapter shows you, LinkedIn’s Recommendations feature offers you 
a powerful tool for finding out more about the people you’re considering 
doing business with, as well as a means to build your own reputation in a 
way that’s publicly visible. I walk through all the steps needed to create a 
Recommendation for someone else, request a Recommendation for your pro-
file, and how to manage your existing Recommendations. 
Understanding Recommendations
The LinkedIn Recommendation process starts in one of three ways:
 
 Unsolicited: When viewing the profile of any of your direct connec-
tions, a Recommend This Person link is clearly displayed at the top of 
the profile, as shown in Figure 8-1. (For more information on connec-
tions, see Chapter 6.) By clicking that link, you can give an unsolicited 
Recommendation.
 
Figure 8-1: 
You can 
start a 
Recom-
mendation 
with any 
first-level 
connection. 
 
Recommend This Person link
 
 Requested: You can request Recommendations from your direct con-
nections. You might send such a request at the end of a successful proj-
ect, for example, or maybe ask for a Recommendation from your boss 
before you plan to transition to a new job.

141
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
 Reciprocated: Whenever you accept a Recommendation from some-
one, LinkedIn presents you with the option of recommending that 
person in return. Some people do this as a thank you for receiving the 
Recommendation, other people reciprocate only because they didn’t 
realize they could leave a Recommendation until someone left them one, 
and there are some people that do not feel comfortable reciprocating 
unless they truly believe the person deserves one. You should decide in 
each circumstance whether you want to reciprocate.  
 
After the Recommendation is written, it’s not posted immediately. It goes to 
the recipient for review, and he has the option to accept it, reject it, or request 
a revision. So even though the majority of Recommendations you see on 
LinkedIn are genuine, they’re also almost entirely positive because they have 
to be accepted by the recipient. 
With LinkedIn, you can use Recommendations in several ways:
 
 On your profile page: LinkedIn shows all of the Recommendations 
you’ve received, as well as links to the profiles of the people who have 
recommended you (see Figure 8-2). This provides that social validation 
you want by allowing people to see exactly who is endorsing you. 
 
 In Advanced Search: One of the options for sorting the results of a LinkedIn 
search is Degrees and Recommendations. This option sorts first by the 
number of degrees or levels a connection is away from you in ascending 
order (for example, your first-degree connections first), and then by the 
number of Recommendations someone has received in descending order 
(for example, those with the most Recommendations first).
 
 In the Services section: The main page displays a list of recent 
Recommendations within your network. Within each category, you can 
choose to view either the most recent Recommendations or the most 
highly recommended service providers within the category. Every 
service provider listed must have at least one Recommendation to be 
included (see Chapter 13 for a more detailed discussion). 
 
Because the number of Recommendations is used as both a sort option for 
searching and a display option in the service provider directory, having a 
large number of Recommendations has a very real impact on your profile’s 
searchability, besides just being impressive. More is definitely better.
 
That said, the quality of the Recommendations matters, as well as who 
they’re from. Five very specific Recommendations from actual clients talking 
about how you helped them solve a problem is probably worth more than 50 
Recommendations from business acquaintances saying, “I like Sally — she’s 
cool,” or, “Hector is a great networker.” And any Recommendations that heartily 
endorse the number of cocktails you had at the last formal event probably need 
revision. Check out the later section, “Gracefully Declining a Recommendation 
(Or a Request for One),” if you’re receiving those kinds of statements.

Writing Recommendations
I suggest you practice making some Recommendations before you start 
requesting them. Here’s the method to my madness: When you know how to 
write a good Recommendation yourself, you’re in a better position to help 
others write good Recommendations for you. And the easiest way to get 
Recommendations is to give them. Every time you make a Recommendation 
and the recipient accepts it, she is prompted to give you a Recommendation. 
Thanks to the basic desire that most people want to be fair when dealing 
with their network, many people will go ahead and endorse you in return.
Choose wisely, grasshopper: 
Deciding who to recommend
Go through your contacts and make a list of the people you want to recom-
mend. As you build your list, consider recommending the following types of 
contacts:

143
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
 People you’ve worked with: I’m not going to say that personal references 
are completely worthless, but standing next to specific Recommendations 
from colleagues and clients, they tend to ring pretty hollow. Business 
Recommendations are much stronger in the LinkedIn context. Your 
Recommendation is rooted in actual side-by-side experience with the 
other party, you can be specific on the behavior and accomplishments of 
the other party, and the examples you give are most likely to be appreci-
ated by the professional LinkedIn community at large.
 
 People you know well: You may choose to connect with casual acquain-
tances or even strangers, but reserve your personal Recommendations 
for people you have an established relationship with (and by that, I 
mean friends and family). Remember, you’re putting your own reputa-
tion on the line with that Recommendation. Are you comfortable risking 
your rep on them? 
 
Only recommend people whose performance you’re actually happy with. 
I can’t say it enough: Your reputation is on the line. Recommending a real 
doofus just to get one Recommendation in return isn’t worth it! Here’s a great 
question to ask yourself when deciding whether to recommend someone: 
Would you feel comfortable recommending this person to a best friend or 
family member? If you say no, well then, you have your answer.
When you complete your To Be Recommended list, you’re probably not 
going to do them all at once, so I suggest copying and pasting the names into 
a word-processing document or spreadsheet so that you can keep track as 
you complete them.
 
If you copy your contacts directly from your LinkedIn contact list into your 
spreadsheet or word processor, a link to your contact profiles will be included 
when you paste the information, making it easier to work from the list. 
Look RIGHT here: Making your 
Recommendation stand out
 
Here are a few things to keep in mind when trying to make your 
Recommendation stand out from the rest of the crowd:
 
 Be specific. Don’t just say the person you’re recommending is great — 
talk about her specific strengths and skills.
 
 Talk about results. Adjectives and descriptions are fluff. Clichés are also 
pretty useless. Tell what the person actually did and the impact it had 
on you and your business. It’s one thing to say, “She has a great eye,” 
and another to say, “The logo she designed for us has been instrumental 
in building our brand and received numerous positive comments from 
customers.”

144
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
 Tell how you know the person. LinkedIn offers only the very basic cat-
egories of colleague, service provider, and business partner. If you’ve 
known this person for 10 years, say so. If she’s your cousin, say so. If 
you’ve never met her in person, say so. Save it for the end, though — 
open with the positive results this person had provided, or the positive 
qualities the person exhibited in your interaction, then qualify the type 
of interaction. 
 
 Reinforce the requestor’s major skills or goals. Look at her profile. 
How is she trying to position herself now? What can you say in your 
Recommendation that will support that? That will be far more appreci-
ated by the recipient. For example, if you read her profile and she is 
really focusing on her project management skills as opposed to her ear-
lier software development skills, your Recommendation should reinforce 
that message she is trying to convey on her profile. 
 
 Don’t gush. By all means, if you think someone is fantastic, exceptional, 
extraordinary, or the best at what she does, say so. But don’t go on and 
on about it.
 
 Be concise. While LinkedIn has a 3000 character limit on the length of 
Recommendations, you shouldn’t reach that limit. That should be more 
than enough to get your point across. Make it as long as it needs to be to 
say what you have to say, and no longer.
Creating a Recommendation
Now you’re ready to write your first Recommendation. To create a 
Recommendation, first you need to pull up the person’s profile:
 
 Click the Connections link (part of the Contacts section) from the left 
navigation menu of any page. 
 
 Then select a name from your connections list. This is the person you’re 
recommending. 
 
 Your Recommendation goes directly to that person, not prospective 
employers. If a prospective employer wants a specific reference, they 
can request it through doing a Reference Check on LinkedIn, which I 
cover in greater detail in Chapter 12. 
 
 Click the Recommend This Person link to the right of their name and 
photo.
 
 Visit the profile of the person you want to recommend.
Now that you’ve identified your person to recommend, you can get your rec-
ommending groove on. Follow these steps:

145
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
1. Select a category for that person. 
 
 As soon as you click the Recommend This Person link, you are imme-
diately prompted to choose an option describing how you know this 
person, as shown in Figure 8-3. Your three choices are
 
• Colleague: You worked together at the same company.
 
• Service Provider: You hired the person to provide a service to you 
or your company.
 
• Business Partner: You worked with the person, but not as a client 
or colleague. (The common use of “business partner” is that you 
are partners in a business together, but that isn’t what this means. 
In that case, if you work in the same company as the other party, 
choose Colleague, even if you are both owners and not manager or 
employee.)
 
 Note that, currently, there’s no option for a personal relationship, nor 
for you being a service provider to the person. In these cases, I recom-
mend that you select Business Partner.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Tell LinkedIn 
how you 
worked with 
the person 
you are rec-
ommending.
 

146
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
2. Click the Go button to proceed. The Create Your Recommendation 
page appears, as shown in Figure 8-4. 
 
 In the case of a Service Provider, the page will look different, but I cover 
that Recommendation in detail in Chapter 13.
 
Figure 8-4:

Recom-
mendation

page on 
LinkedIn.
 
 
3. Define your relationship with the person you’re recommending by 
answering a few questions. 
 
 Each of the three drop-down boxes on-screen ask you to pick an answer 
from a pre-defined list. Specifically, you will be asked to: 
 
a. Define the basis of your relationship. 
 
 If you are a colleague of the person, LinkedIn wants to know if you 
managed the person, worked side-by-side with the other party, or if 
that person was the manager or senior official. If you are a business 
partner, LinkedIn wants to know if you worked at a different company 
from the other person or whether the person was a client of yours.  
 
b. Define your title at the time. 
 
 You are asked to identify which position you held when you 
observed the behavior you are recommending in the other person. 
This list is generated from the positions you defined in your 
LinkedIn profile. If your experience overlaps multiple positions, pick 
the position that best defines your relationship with the other party.

147
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
c. Define their title at the time. 
 
 You have to select at least one position the other party held 
to associate the Recommendation. You can only enter one 
Recommendation per position, but you can recommend the other 
party on multiple positions.
 
 By answering these questions, this informs anyone reading the 
Recommendation about how you know the person you’re recommend-
ing. Perhaps you were the person’s manager at one time.
 
4. Write the Recommendation in the Written Recommendation box 
provided.
 
 Remember the tips I mentioned earlier about staying specific, concise, 
and professional while focusing on results and skills. Keep in mind that 
Recommendations you write also appear in your own profile in a tab 
marked Recommendations. Believe it or not, people judge you by the 
comments you leave about others, not just what they say about you. So, 
look over your Recommendation before you post it, and watch for obvi-
ous spelling or grammatical errors. 
 
5. If you want, include a note in the Personalize This Message text box.
 
 When you send your Recommendation, you have the option to also 
attach a personal note. Simply click the View/Edit link next to the line “A 
message will be sent to X with your Recommendation.” If it’s someone 
you’re in recent contact with, the note is probably unnecessary — the 
endorsement should speak for itself. But if it’s someone you haven’t 
spoken to in a while, take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect 
with a brief note (see Figure 8-5). You can keep the boilerplate text, “I’ve 
written this Recommendation of your work to share with other LinkedIn 
users” or you can write your own note, like I did in Figure 8-5. 
 
6. Click the Send button.
 
 The Recommendation is sent to the recipient.
After you’ve sent your Recommendation, remember that the other person 
has to accept it before it’s posted. Don’t take it personally if she doesn’t 
post it, or at least not right away. It’s a gift, freely given. The primary value 
to you is in the gesture to the recipient, not the public visibility of your 
Recommendation. And if she comes back with requested changes to the 
Recommendation, by all means accommodate her, so long as it’s all true and 
you feel comfortable with it. It’s a service to her, not you.

148

idea.
 
Requesting Recommendations
In an ideal world, you’d never request a Recommendation. Everyone who’s 
had a positive experience working with you would just automatically post a 
raving Recommendation on LinkedIn. 
But the reality is that most likely only your raving fans and very heavy LinkedIn 
users are going to make unsolicited Recommendations. Your mildly happy cus-
tomers, former bosses whose jokes you laughed at consistently, and co-workers 
who you haven’t seen in five years could all stand a little prompting. 
Be prepared, though: Some people feel that Recommendations should only 
be given freely, and they may be taken aback by receiving a Recommendation 
request. So it’s imperative that you frame your request with a personal mes-
sage, not just a generic message from LinkedIn.

149
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
Choosing who to request 
Recommendations from
Request Recommendations from the same people whom you might write 
them for: colleagues, business partners, and service providers. The only dif-
ference is that you’re looking at it from his point of view.
Relationships aren’t all symmetrical. For example, if someone hears me 
speak at a conference and buys this book, that person is a customer of 
mine. My customers know my skills and expertise fairly well — perhaps 
not on the same level as a consulting client, but still enough to make a 
Recommendation. I, on the other hand, may not know a customer at all. I’m 
open to getting to know him, and I’m willing to connect, but I can’t write a 
Recommendation for him yet.
Creating a polite Recommendation request
When you identified in your mind the person (or people) you want to write 
you Recommendations, you’re ready to create a Recommendation request. 
To get started on authoring your request follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Profile link from the left navigation menu.
 
2. Scroll down to the position for which you want to request an endorse-
ment and click either the Request Recommendations link (displayed 
if you don’t already have any for that position) or the Manage link (if 
you already have one or more Recommendations for the position).
 
 If you look at Figure 8-6, you can see the link you have to click. If you 
already have Recommendations, you have to scroll down the page and 
click the link labeled Request Endorsements from Up to X Connections, 
where X is the amount of first-level connections you currently have, as 
shown in Figure 8-7.
 
3. Click the Select Connections button and select the person you want 
to request a Recommendation from. You can send this request to as 
many as 200 people
 
 You will see a new window pop up like in Figure 8-8. Scroll through your 
list of first-degree connections and click the check box next to each 
person to whom you would like to send this Recommendation request.

4. Click the Finished button to close the Connections window and go 
back to your Request Recommendations screen.
 
5. Create your message by typing in the box provided, as shown in 
Figure 8-9.
 
 The same etiquette is recommended here as in other requests — you 
should not accept the boilerplate text that LinkedIn fills in, but rather 
customize it to create a personal note, like I did in Figure 8-9. You can 
customize not only the body of your message but the subject line as 
well. 
 
6. Check your spelling and grammar.
 
7. Click the Send button to send your request. 
 
 The Recommendation request is sent to the intended recipient.
 
Giving people some context as to why you’re making the request helps moti-
vate them more effectively. Also, even though you should be asking only 
people that would be comfortable recommending you (you are, aren’t you?), 
you still want to give them a gracious way to decline.
Remember, you’re asking a favor. The person you’re contacting is in no way 
obligated, so don’t expect anything and you won’t be disappointed.

152

There’s really no such thing as too many Recommendations, so long as the 
quality is good. Even if you have just two or three mediocre ones, people will 
start to think that a lot of them are fluff. LinkedIn doesn’t give you control over 
the display order either, so you have all the more reason to make sure that the 
ones displayed are good quality.
Gracefully Declining a Recommendation 
(Or a Request for One)
Unfortunately, not everyone naturally writes good Recommendations, and all 
of your LinkedIn connections haven’t read this book, so eventually it’s bound 
to happen: Someone will write a Recommendation that you don’t want to 
show on your profile.
No problem. Just politely request a replacement when you receive it. Thank 
him for thinking of you, and give him the context of what you’re trying to 
accomplish:

153
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
Wei:
Thank you so much for your gracious Recommendation. I’d like to ask 
a small favor, though. I’m really trying to position myself more as a 
public speaker in the widget industry, rather than as a gadget trainer. 
Since you’ve heard me speak on the topic, if you could gear your 
Recommendation more towards that, I’d greatly appreciate it.
Thanks,
Alexa
If he’s sincerely trying to be of service to you, he should have no problem 
changing it. Just make sure you ask him for something based on your actual 
experience with him.
 
You also may receive a request for a Recommendation from someone you 
don’t feel comfortable recommending. If it’s because she gave you poor ser-
vice or was less than competent, you have to consider whether you should 
even be connected to her at all in LinkedIn, since it is a business referral 
system. I discuss how to remove a connection in Chapter 6.  
But it may just be that you don’t have sufficient experience with her services 
to provide her a Recommendation. If that’s the case, then just reply to her 
request with an explanation:
Alicia:
I received your request for a Recommendation. While I’m happy to be 
connected to you on LinkedIn, and look forward to getting to know 
you better, or even work together in the future, at this point in time I 
just don’t feel like I have enough basis to give you a really substantive 
Recommendation. 
Once we’ve actually worked together on something successfully, I’ll be 
more than happy to provide a Recommendation.
Thanks,
Wei
Managing Recommendations
Relationships change over time. Sometimes they get better; occasionally 
they get worse. And sometimes they just change. Also, as you get more 
Recommendations, you may decide that you don’t want to display them all, 
or that you would like some of them updated to support your current brand-
ing or initiatives.

154
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
Fortunately, neither the Recommendation you give nor those you receive 
are etched in stone (or computer chips, as the case may be). You can edit or 
remove the Recommendations you’ve written at any time, and you can hide 
or request revisions to those you receive. 
Editing or deleting Recommendations 
you’ve made
To edit or remove a Recommendation you’ve made, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Profile link from the left navigation menu.
 
2. Click the Recommendations tab in your profile.
 
 All of the Recommendations you’ve made are listed in reverse chrono-
logical order, as shown in Figure 8-10. You can narrow the list down by 
clicking the link for Colleagues, Service Providers, or Business Partners 
below the header Manage Recommendations You’ve Made.
 
Figure 8-10: 
Pick the 
Recom-
mendation 
you want 
to edit or 
delete. 
 
 
3. Click Edit next to the Recommendation you want to change or remove.
 
 You are taken to the Edit Recommendations screen, as shown in Figure 
8-11. You can update some of the Relationship choices, like Basis of the 
Recommendation, or update your Recommendation text.

 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
Figure 8-11: 
Make 
changes 
to your

mendation 
or withdraw 
it altogether.
 
Withdraw This Recommendation link
 
4. Edit the Recommendation and click Send or click Withdraw This 
Recommendation.
If you edit a Recommendation, it is submitted to the recipient again for 
approval. If you remove it, it comes off immediately, and the recipient (or is 
that the unrecipient?) doesn’t receive any notification.
 
You can change the Basis of the Recommendation field, which describes the 
exact relationship, such as whether you worked in the same department, 
or one of you was subordinate to the other. However, you can’t change the 
type of Recommendation, for example, Colleague versus Service Provider 
versus Business Partner. If you need to do so, you have to remove the current 
Recommendation and write a new one, choosing the appropriate option.
Handling new Recommendations 
you’ve received
Every time you receive a Recommendation from someone else, you will see a 
message show up in your LinkedIn inbox, as shown in Figure 8-12. 

156
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
Figure 8-12: 
Here is 
where you 
can accept 
an incoming 
Recom-
mendation.
 
When you receive a Recommendation, you have these options:
 
 Accept and show it on your profile. Make sure the Show this 
Recommendation on my profile option is selected. 
 
 Accept and hide it. You might choose this option if you don’t want to 
decline the person’s Recommendation, but for some reason you don’t 
want to display it (see the following section).
 
 Request replacement. If you aren’t completely happy with his 
Recommendation, choose this option and you’ll be given the opportu-
nity to send him a brief note explaining what you would like changed.
 
 Archive it. This removes the Recommendation message from your 
LinkedIn inbox. It is available for later retrieval, just not as easily 
as if you choose the Hide option. You simply have to click the link 
“Show archived messages” when looking at your LinkedIn inbox for 
Recommendations; I cover the inbox in further detail in Chapter 9. 
Removing a Recommendation 
or requesting a revision
To remove a Recommendation you’ve received or request a revision, here’s 
what you do:

157
 Chapter 8: Exploring the Power of Recommendations
 
1. Click the Profile link from the left navigation menu.
 
2. Scroll down to the position the Recommendation is for and click the 
Manage link.
 
 This will take you to the Manage Received Recommendations page, as 
shown in Figure 8-13. 
 
Figure 8-13: 
Remove 
a Recom-
mendation 
or request 
a revision 
here. 
 
 
3. To hide a Recommendation, deselect the Show check box. Then click 
the Save Changes button to hide your Recommendation.
 
4. To request a new or revised Recommendation, click the Request a 
New or Revised Recommendation From link.
 
 This takes you back to the Request Recommendation screen (which 
I cover in the earlier section, “Creating a polite Recommendation 
request”) where you should write a brief note explaining why you’re 
requesting a change.
 
5. Click the Send button to send your request.
Negotiating the social graces around Recommendations may feel a little awk-
ward at first, but it will quickly become comfortable with a little practice. By 
both giving and receiving good Recommendations, you’ll build your public 
reputation, increase your social capital with your connections and have a 
good excuse for renewing some of your relationships with people you haven’t 
contacted recently.

Keeping Track of Your 
LinkedIn Activities
In This Chapter
 Using LinkedIn as your command console
 Reading your network updates
 Understanding your Inbox
 Tracking InMail and Introductions
 Tracking sent and received Invitations 
I
 talk a lot about the different functions available on LinkedIn for you to 
use, and hopefully you’ve started to set aside some time on a regular 
basis to keep track of various tasks as you build up your profile and net-
work. Because of the growing amount of functions available on LinkedIn, you 
should take a look around the site to see how you can manage this new set of 
tasks most effectively. 
In this chapter, I detail the different ways you can access the LinkedIn func-
tions, as well as how you can keep track of incoming mail, Invitations, and 
other messages that require your input or approval. I discuss the functions 
that you can access from the left navigation menu on the LinkedIn home 
page. I also take a look into the LinkedIn Inbox, where all your messages, 
Invitations, answers, and communication are received. Then, I go over some 
ways you can set up the LinkedIn site to communicate with you through 
e-mail and keep you informed of communication from other LinkedIn users, 
whether it refers to Invitations, Introductions, Recommendations, Answers, 
or other LinkedIn functions. 

160
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
Using the LinkedIn Home Page 
as Your Command Console
The LinkedIn home page is, by default, full of information about how you use 
the site and should be thought of as your command console for working with 
LinkedIn. You can get to the home page at any time by clicking the LinkedIn 
logo in the top-left corner of every LinkedIn Web page. When you do so, you 
see a variety of information, as shown in Figure 9-1. Keep in mind that your 
home page is unique to your LinkedIn identity and will look different from 
mine (shown in Figure 9-1) or any other user on LinkedIn. Your page is built 
based on the first-degree connections in your network, your pending mes-
sages in your Inbox, and the level of participation with functions like LinkedIn 
Answers or Recommendations. 
 
Figure 9-1: 
Coordinate 
all your 
LinkedIn 
activities 
through the 
home page. 
 
First off, check out the menu in the top-left corner. I refer to this menu as the 
left navigation menu. This menu has all of the major categories for checking 
your activities on LinkedIn. By clicking the plus (+) signs next to each func-
tion, you can expand the menu to see more options. Figure 9-2 shows a fully 
expanded menu. 

161
 Chapter 9: Keeping Track of Your LinkedIn Activities
 
Figure 9-2: 
Fully expand 
your menu 
options!
 
 
If you expand these menu options, LinkedIn remembers this and always show 
you an expanded menu whenever you go back to the Web site. 
As you can see from the expanded menu, any unanswered messages or invi-
tations in your Inbox show up as numbers in parentheses next to the cor-
responding category of the Inbox. You can click any of those categories to 
go straight to that part of the Inbox to check them. If you look at Figure 9-1 
again, notice that you can go to your Inbox by clicking the word Inbox from 
the middle of the screen (if you have any pending messages), or you can go 
straight to one of the five most recent messages in your Inbox by clicking the 
appropriate subject link. 
If you scroll down your LinkedIn home page, you see modules of other 
aspects of LinkedIn, like Answers, Jobs, and Network Updates, as shown in 
Figure 9-3. Based on your profile, positions, and whether you participate in 
functions like LinkedIn Answers, the site provides a default configuration for 
your home page and includes the modules it thinks are most useful to you. 

162

Reading your network updates
One of the ways to stay involved with your LinkedIn network is to stay up to 
date on how your first-degree connections are using LinkedIn (for more on 
connection degrees, see Chapter 1). To that end, a section called Network 
Updates gives you a summary of all the activity within your immediate 
LinkedIn network. 
Figure 9-3 gives you an idea of what this network update can contain. If you 
are looking at the Network Updates section of your LinkedIn home page, you 
can scroll down and click the See More Network Updates link to get a full list-
ing of your network updates, as shown in Figure 9-4. 
You can customize the network updates you see in your section, so you need 
to decide which of the following events are worth keeping track of:
 
 Any Photo updates to your connections’ profiles
 
 Any Profile updates your connections make to their profiles
 
 Any Recommendations given by a first-degree connection
 
 Any new connections in your extended network (meaning any new 
connections your first-degree contacts made)

Having LinkedIn automatically 
contact you
Sure, you can do all the footwork by going to the LinkedIn home page and 
looking around to see what messages or changes have occurred. The true 
power of staying connected, however, is having LinkedIn automatically con-
tact you with the information you need to stay informed. 
When you click the Account & Settings link on the home page, you go to the 
Account & Settings page, which contains information about your account 
and your LinkedIn settings. Scroll down to the Settings section, as shown in 
Figure 9-6. This is your hub for controlling how you interact with LinkedIn 
and how the site will communicate with you.

 You’re taken to the Receiving Messages page, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
2. Review the list of options and decide how you want to receive your 
e-mails. Select the radio button in one of the three columns: 
 
• Individual Email: As soon as something occurs in a given category, 
like Introductions, Invitations, or Job Notifications, LinkedIn will 
send you an e-mail with that one item in the email.
 
• Digest Email: Instead of individual e-mails, LinkedIn would group 
together all the activities in a given category and send you one 
e-mail per week in a digest format, with a summary at the top of 
the e-mail and the detailed activities below the summary.
 
• Web Only: You can turn off e-mail notification by selecting the 
Web Only option. You can read the message when logged in to the 
LinkedIn site.
 
3. (Optional) Select the Send Me Messages about New Features and Tips 
check box to sign up for a monthly newsletter from LinkedIn.

Understanding your Inbox
The best hub for your communications is the LinkedIn Inbox. You can get to 
the Inbox by clicking the Inbox link in the left navigation menu. In most cases, 
you go to the action items (or new messages that require your attention) in 
your Inbox, as shown in Figure 9-8. If you have no pending items, you will see 
a link to display all your archived (old) messages.
Here are some things to keep in mind when navigating your Inbox:
 
 Using the links on the right: You can click any of the links along the 
right side to see your InMail, Introductions, Invitations, Q&A, Jobs, 
Messages, forwarded Profiles, or Recommendations. Boldface type indi-
cates that you have unread or action items to clear out. 
 
 Archiving: In some cases, the items in this list have been acted on (In 
the upcoming Figure 9-9, an InMail from Kay Luo has been accepted), 
but if you want the item removed as an action item, click the subject link 
to bring up the message and then click the Archive button from inside 
the message to remove the item from your Inbox. 

167
 Chapter 9: Keeping Track of Your LinkedIn Activities
 
Figure 9-8: 
Review the 
action items 
in your 
Inbox.
 
 
 Viewing the archive: If you ever want to view your archived messages, 
look for a link entitled Show Archived Messages, which appears near the 
top of any of your Inbox subject pages, like Messages, Introductions, and 
so on. When you click that link, your archived message appears in the 
list with all other messages. 
 
 Flagging your message: If you click the drop-down arrow next to 
Compose Message (in the top-right corner of your Inbox page) you can 
choose from several options, like sending an Invitation, Introduction, 
Recommendation, or Job notification. 
Tracking Your InMail and 
Your Introductions
Although many of your communications with immediate first-degree LinkedIn 
connections take place through your own e-mail system, communications 
with people outside your network of first-degree connections need to be 
tracked and responded to using LinkedIn. So take a look at how you can track 
InMail and Introductions through your LinkedIn Inbox.

168
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
You can click either the InMail or Introductions link underneath the Inbox 
link, in the left navigation menu, to go directly to your list of InMail messages 
or Introductions. For example, when I click the InMail link, I go to the InMails 
page shown in Figure 9-9. Note that, even though I’ve accepted the InMail, 
the top message shows up as an action item (see the flag next to the person’s 
name) because I haven’t yet used LinkedIn to reply to or archive this mes-
sage. In addition, you can easily switch between received and sent InMails by 
clicking the Received or Sent links near the top right of the screen.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Take a look 
at the InMail 
you’ve 
received. 
 
If you take a look at your Introductions message list, you see a setup like 
the one shown in Figure 9-10. You can easily switch between received and 
sent Introductions by clicking the Received or Sent links near the top right 
of the screen. Figure 9-10 is set to show received Introductions. The top 
Introduction in this example, Patrick Crane, has been accepted but is await-
ing my reply to Mr. Crane’s acceptance. The second Introduction, from David 
Nakayama, has yet to be acted upon, but both items still retain the action flag 
indicating a current to-do item. 
The process is similar for tracking your answers for any questions you 
may have posed on LinkedIn Answers and for any Recommendations you 
may have received. Turn to Chapters 7 if you want to find out about how to 
respond to Answers, and see Chapter 8 for more info on Recommendations.

Tracking Invitations
As you grow your network, keep track of the Invitations you’ve made to 
your connections and any incoming Invitations from other people. I cover 
Invitations in Chapter 2, and I talk about setting up your notifications for 
receiving e-mail about Invitations in the section “Having LinkedIn automati-
cally contact you” earlier this chapter, but the following sections tell you 
about monitoring your Invitations on the LinkedIn Web site. 
Tracking sent Invitations
The last thing you want to do is send out repeat Invitations to the same 
person because you didn’t monitor your Sent Invitations list. Also, you may 
want to review your Sent Invitations list because someone hasn’t responded 
yet; you can send that person a follow-up e-mail either through LinkedIn or 
via your own e-mail account. Thankfully, LinkedIn keeps a running list of all 
the Invitations you sent out with the current status (Accepted, Doesn’t Know, 
Expired, or Sent) of each Invitation on that page as well. 
When you want to track your sent Invitations, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Contacts link in the left navigation menu.
 
 This opens up the list of all your current first-degree connections, as 
shown in Figure 9-11.

2. Click the Sent Invitations link to pull up a list of all your sent 
Invitations. 
 
 You see the Sent Invitations page, as shown in Figure 9-12. The status 
besides each Invitation shows up as Sent (gray), Accepted (green), or 
Don’t Know (red). 
 
Figure 9-12: 
See a list of 
your sent 
Invitations 
and their 
statuses. 
 

171
 Chapter 9: Keeping Track of Your LinkedIn Activities
 
3. You can click any of the column headers (like To, Subject, Status, or 
Date) to change the sort order of the list.
 
 For example, you can group all your Invitations by Status: Just click 
the Status column header once to sort the list by status. At the top 
are Accepted messages, then Doesn’t Know, Expired, Sent, and finally 
Withdrawn invitations.
 
4. To view an individual Invitation, click the Subject link for that particu-
lar Invitation.
 
 You see a copy of your Invitation, like the one shown in Figure 9-13. In 
this particular case, you see the options presented because the recipi-
ent has not acted on the Invitation yet.
 
Figure 9-13: 
Review an 
Invitation 
you’ve 
sent out.
 
 
5. Click the Resend button to send a reminder to this person; click the 
Withdraw button to delete your Invitation request.
 
 When you withdraw the request, no message is sent to the other person.
Tracking received Invitations
When growing your LinkedIn network, you should be responsive to others 
who want to add you to their LinkedIn connections lists. To review your 
received Invitations, follow these steps.

172
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
1. Click the plus sign next to the Inbox link and then click the Invitations 
link in the list that appears in the left navigation menu.
 
 You’re taken to a list of your received Invitations, as shown in Figure 
9-14. The status of each Invitation is shown in the Status column.
 
Figure 9-14: 
Review your 
received 
Invitations 
here.
 
 
2. When you want to review a Pending Invitation, click the Subject link. 
(It will typically say Join My Network on LinkedIn, but the other party 
may have customized the text.)
 
 You see the Invitation Request. Click either Accept, I Don’t Know (this 
person), or Archive. There are also links you can click to Reply (to get 
further clarification in case you do not recognize the person) or Flag as 
Spam. (See Chapter 6 for tips on growing your network.)
 
 In some cases, you may see an entry with the subject link RE: Join My 
Network on LinkedIn and the status of Pending. These are replies to invi-
tations you made to a person. When you click the Subject link, you see 
the reply, along with three buttons, as shown in Figure 9-15, that allow 
you to View Invitation, Reply, or Archive the message.
 
3. To change the status of this message from Pending, either click the 
Reply button to send this person a response or click the Archive 
button to remove it from the list.

T
his chapter delves into how you can use LinkedIn as a part of your over-
all presence on the Internet, especially when it comes to communication. 
Specifically, I focus on two aspects of your Internet experience: your e-mail 
account and Internet Web browser.
LinkedIn makes it convenient for you to exchange information between your 
e-mail program and your LinkedIn profile and to enhance your World Wide 
Web browsing experience with specialized LinkedIn functions. One feature that 
LinkedIn offers is to enable you to import your contact list from programs such 
as Microsoft Outlook into LinkedIn. You can also do the reverse — that is, export 
your LinkedIn contact list to a variety of e-mail programs, including that for your 
Mac OS X. Another neat feature in LinkedIn is some toolbars that you can easily 
install to work with your e-mail program and Web browser. For example, the 
Outlook toolbar allows you to access certain LinkedIn information while writing 
e-mails in Outlook. I cover all these cool features in this chapter.
I also tell you about a nifty tool that LinkedIn offers to create an e-mail 
signature block for you that helps you promote your LinkedIn profile. 

176
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
Importing Contacts into LinkedIn
One of the most popular (and necessary) activities people use the Internet 
for is e-mail. Your e-mail account contains a wealth of information in the form 
of lists and memos with everyone you regularly communicate with via e-mail. 
Therefore, because you’ve already established this base of communications, 
LinkedIn offers a way for you to ramp up your network by importing a list of 
contacts from your e-mail program. After all, if you’ve already sent or received 
an e-mail from someone (who’s not a spammer, of course), chances are you 
know that person in some respect and would like to connect with them via 
LinkedIn if you haven’t already. Importing your e-mail contacts into LinkedIn 
takes the drudge work out of going through your Address Book and copying 
addresses into LinkedIn. The next sections show you how to generate a list of 
contacts and import that list into LinkedIn to update your connections. 
Importing a Contacts list from Outlook
One of the most popular e-mail programs used today is Microsoft Outlook, 
especially in corporations that run the Windows operating system. This 
section shows you how to import your Microsoft Outlook Contacts list into 
LinkedIn. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. On the main Outlook screen, click Contacts to bring up your Contact 
List (similar to that shown in Figure 10-1).
 
Figure 10-1: 
Pull up your 
Outlook 
Contacts 
list.
 
 
2. Choose File ➪Import and Export.
 
 The Import and Export window appears.

177
 Chapter 10: Using LinkedIn with Your E-Mail and Browser
 
3. Select the Export to a File option and click the Next button; then, in 
the Export to a File window, select a file type.
 
 You see a list of options, like Comma Separated Values (DOS), Comma 
Separated Values (Windows), Microsoft Access, and so on. 
 
4. Select the Comma Separated Values (Windows) option and click the 
Next button.
 
 The Export to a File window appears, as shown in Figure 10-2. Here, 
you’re asked to pick a folder that you want to export. You need to look 
for the Contacts window, which contains your list of Contacts through 
Microsoft Outlook. 
 
Figure 10-2: 
Select your 
Contacts 
folder to 
export.
 
 
5. Select the Contacts folder to export and click the Next button. 
 
 If you have created categories within your Outlook Contacts list, you can 
select one of those subcategories under the main Contacts folder and 
export just those contacts.
 
6. In the next Export to a File window that appears, click the Browse 
button to find a suitable folder for this file, create a filename in the 
box provided, and click the Next button.
 
 In the last box, Outlook displays the action it’s about to take as shown in 
Figure 10-3.
 
 Be sure to remember the filename and location of your exported Contacts 
file because you’ll need this information in a few steps. Pick a memorable 
name and save the file to a commonly used folder on your computer.
 
7. Click the Finish button to start the export of your Outlook Contacts file.
 
 Depending on the size of your Contacts list, the export process may take 
a few minutes. When the export is complete, the message box disap-
pears from your screen and you re ready to go to the next step. 
 
8. Using your Web browser, go to LinkedIn and log in to your profile; 
then, on the left navigation menu, click Connections to bring up your 
LinkedIn network. 

178
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
Figure 10-3:

action.
 
 
9. Click the Add Connections link from the top of the Connections screen 
and then, click the Import Contacts tab. On the page that appears, 
click the Other Address Book button.
 
 The first page of the Upload Your Contacts File appears, as shown in 
Figure 10-4. 
 
10. Click the Browse button to locate the Contacts file you just exported 
from Microsoft Outlook. When you’ve located that file, click the 
Upload Contacts File button to start the process.
 
 After LinkedIn has read your entire contacts list, LinkedIn displays a few 
sample names to make sure it has imported your list correctly, as shown 
in Figure 10-5. 
 
 When LinkedIn imports the list, they usually drop the middle name from 
each person’s full name when creating the imported contacts. You may 
need to edit your contacts to add the appropriate information.
 
11. Review the sample names and, if correct, click the Finish Upload 
button to complete the process.
 
 If the names aren’t correct, you can click the Send to Customer Service 
button to send this list to LinkedIn Customer Support for help, or you 
can click the Cancel Upload button to abandon the process. 
 
12. If you clicked the Finish Upload button, you should see your new con-
tacts in the Imported Contacts screen of your Connections list, similar 
to that shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 You can select the box next to individual contacts, or select the Select 
All check box, and then click the Invite Selected Contacts button to 
invite each of these people to your LinkedIn network.

Importing contacts from a Web-based 
e-mail program
Many people use a program based on the World Wide Web to send and 
receive e-mail. Gmail (from Google), Yahoo! Mail, and Hotmail are among the 
most prevalent of this type of program, which is known as Webmail. If you 
use a Webmail program, you can still import your contact list and feed it into 
LinkedIn to expand your network. For the example in this section, I use Yahoo! 
Mail, but the other systems work similarly to Yahoo! for importing contacts.
To import your Webmail contact list, just follow these steps:
 
1. Using your Web browser, go to LinkedIn and log in to your profile; 
then, on the left navigation menu, click Connections to bring up your 
LinkedIn network.
 
2. Click the Add Connections link at the top of the Connections screen 
and then click the Import Contacts tab.
 
 The Check Webmail page appears, as shown in Figure 10-7. 
 
3. Click the Check Webmail button.
 
 After you click this button, LinkedIn asks you to pick your Webmail 
program from a list presented (Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, and AOL) by 

181
 Chapter 10: Using LinkedIn with Your E-Mail and Browser
selecting the appropriate radio button. After you select the service, you 
will either provide your login information on the same screen or click a 
button to be taken to the program, as shown in Figure 10-8. 
 
4. Follow the instructions to access your Webmail account.
 
 For this example, I clicked the Login to Yahoo! Button, which took me 
to the Yahoo! login screen. After I logged in to my account, Yahoo! 
requested my permission to let LinkedIn access my Yahoo! Address 
Book, as shown in Figure 10-9. You must click the I Agree button if you 
want LinkedIn to import your contacts. When you do this, LinkedIn 
automatically goes into the account and starts importing contacts, and 
you’re returned to the LinkedIn Web site. 
 
5. When you connect your Webmail account to LinkedIn, review the 
imported contacts and whom you want to invite to your LinkedIn 
network.
 
 Select the check box next to each person you want to invite and then 
click the Invite Selected Contacts button to send the Invitation.

Exporting Contacts from LinkedIn 
to Your E-Mail Application
As you use LinkedIn and build up your contact network, you may find 
yourself in the situation of having more contacts “on file” in your LinkedIn 
network than your e-mail program. As you transfer your communications 
with LinkedIn members from the LinkedIn message system to your e-mail 
program, adding people one by one to your address book could take a while. 
Thankfully, LinkedIn has a function to make this easier.
In essence, your list of LinkedIn connections is similar to a list of names that 
could be found in an e-mail program’s Address Book. Therefore, just as you 
can import contacts from an e-mail program into LinkedIn, the reverse is 
also true — you can export your LinkedIn contacts to your e-mail program. 
Exporting is a simple process that amounts to doing the following:
 
1. You export your LinkedIn connections into a contacts file.
 
2. You import the contacts file into your main e-mail program. 
You can always pick and choose which contacts to export, and your e-mail 
program should be able to detect any duplicates — meaning if you try to 
import any names that already exist. I walk you through the process of 
exporting your LinkedIn contacts in the next few sections.
Creating your Contacts 
export file in LinkedIn
First, you need to generate your exported file of contacts from LinkedIn. To 
do so, follow these steps:
 
1. On your LinkedIn profile page, click Connections on the left naviga-
tion bar and scroll to the bottom of the page that appears.
 
2. Click the link marked Export Connections.
 
 You will be taken to the Export Connections page, as shown in Figure 10-10. 
Pick the e-mail program you want to export your contacts to from the drop-
down list provided. Then, enter the security image text into the box provided. 
 
3. Click the Export button to generate your Contacts file.
 
 The file dialog box appears, asking whether you want to open or save 
the file. Click Save to save the file to your computer. Give it a custom 
name, if you like, but remember the filename and location, because you 
will need that information when you load this file into your e-mail pro-
gram, which I discuss in the next sections.

184
Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
Figure 10-10: 
Pick your 
e-mail 
program 
and create 
an exported 
file of 
contacts.
 
Exporting contacts to Outlook
After you have created your export file and are ready to export your contacts 
to Microsoft Outlook, just follow these steps:
 
1. On the main Outlook screen, choose File➪Import and Export.
 
 The Import and Export window appears.
 
2. Select the Import from Another Program or File option and click the 
Next button. 
 
3. When Outlooks asks you to select a file type to import from, select the 
Comma Separated Values (Windows) option and click the Next button. 
 
4. When Outlook asks you for the file to import, enter the path and file-
name of your exported file, or click the Browse button to find the file 
on your computer. Be sure to select the Do Not Import Duplicate Items 
option and then click Next to continue. 
 
 If you don’t select the Do Not Import Duplicate Items option, you risk 
flooding your Outlook account with multiple e-mail addresses and 
names for the same people, which will make your life more difficult and 
flood your connections with unnecessary e-mail messages. 
 
5. When Outlook asks you to select a destination folder, click the 
Contacts folder and click Next. 
 
6. Verify that you’re importing your contacts file into Outlook and click 
Finish to start the process. 

185
 Chapter 10: Using LinkedIn with Your E-Mail and Browser
Exporting contacts to Outlook Express
Fortunately, even if you prefer Outlook Express to the full Outlook program, 
you’re in luck: Your LinkedIn contacts can go live there just as easily as they 
can elsewhere. After you’ve created your export file (as described earlier, in 
the “Creating your Contacts export file in LinkedIn” section), you can export 
your connections to Outlook Express by following these steps:
 
1. On your main Outlook Express screen, choose File➪Import.
 
2. In the Import window opens up, select the Other Address Book option 
and click Next. 
 
3. When Outlook Express asks you to select a file type to import from, 
select the option Text File (Comma Separated Values) and click the 
Import button. 
 
4. When Outlook Express asks you for the File to import, enter the path 
and filename of your exported file, or click the Browse button to find 
the file on your computer. Click Next to continue. 
 
5. Verify the fields that you’re importing into Outlook Express (click the 
Change Mapping button if you want to change how the information is 
being imported) and then Click Finish to start the process. 
Exporting contacts to Yahoo! Mail
If you’re using a Web-based mail program, like Yahoo! Mail, you can follow 
this basic procedure to export your LinkedIn contacts into your mail pro-
gram. After you have created your export file (as described earlier, in the 
“Creating your Contacts export file in LinkedIn” section), you can export your 
connections to Yahoo! Mail by following these steps:
 
1. Using your Web browser, go to Yahoo! Mail and log in and then click the 
Contacts tab or the Address Book link to go to the Yahoo! Address Book.
 
 You will see a page similar to that shown in Figure 10-11. Note that 
Import/Export Link in the top-right corner.
 
2. Click the Import/Export link. 
 
 The Import and Export screen appears, as shown in Figure 10-12.
 
3. In the drop-down list under Choose a Program to Import Contacts 
From , select Yahoo! (.CSV). In the box under Specify the File to 
Import, enter the path and filename of your exported file, or click the 
Browse button to find the file on your computer. 
 
4. Click the Import Now button to start the process.

Exporting contacts to Mac OS X 
Address Book
After you’ve created your export file (as described earlier, in the “Creating 
your Contacts export file in LinkedIn” section), you can export your connec-
tions to Mac OS X Address Book by following these steps:
 
1. Open your Mac OS X Address Book program by clicking it. 
 
2. Look for the contacts file you created in the previous section on your 
computer.
 
3. Drag this file into the Address Book. 
 
 This should start the importing of contacts from your LinkedIn contacts file. 
Using the LinkedIn Outlook Toolbar
If you use Microsoft Outlook for your e-mail and you find yourself constantly 
switching between Outlook and the LinkedIn Web site to retrieve informa-
tion, send e-mail to your connections using Outlook, and screen incoming 
e-mail by jumping to LinkedIn to read their profile, you’re in luck! LinkedIn 
has developed a special toolbar that you can install in your system that auto-
matically ties into its Web site. This toolbar appears as part of your Microsoft 
Outlook screen and gives you several functions to make the connection 
between Outlook and LinkedIn smoother. 
Understanding the toolbar’s 
requirements and features
To use the LinkedIn Outlook toolbar, you need to have certain levels of soft-
ware on your computer for the toolbar to work correctly. 
 
 Your operating system needs to be either Microsoft Windows XP or Vista. 
 
 Your Microsoft Outlook program should be the XP (or 2002), 2003, or 
2007 version. 
 
 You should have at least 5@nd10MB of free space on your hard drive 
before installing this program. 
Here are the main benefits you can enjoy after installing this toolbar function:

Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
 
 This toolbar will suggest sending an Invitation to someone to join your 
network based on the number of times you e-mail that person. The 
higher the “e-mail frequency,” the more likely you should add them to 
your LinkedIn network.
 
 This toolbar allows you to send Invitations with one click, instead 
of your having to find the person’s profile on LinkedIn and clicking 
through the Invite process. You can also pull up the LinkedIn Web site 
with one click using the toolbar.
 
 This toolbar automatically displays a LinkedIn “mini-profile” of some-
one when you read an e-mail from that person using Outlook. This way, 
you can get more information about the sender, in the form of a pop-up, 
instantly rather than manually going to LinkedIn to research the person.
 
 Your Outlook contact information for a LinkedIn connection is auto-
matically updated with that connection’s profile information. 
 
 You can receive e-mail notifications when someone in your LinkedIn 
network updates his or her profile information. 
 
 You can access a LinkedIn “dashboard” to get a snapshot of your 
LinkedIn network and the status of your connections.
Installing the Outlook Toolbar
To install the Outlook toolbar, just follow these steps:
 
1. Go to LinkedIn’s home page, scroll to the bottom of the page, and in 
the section marked Tools, click the link Outlook Toolbar.
 
 The Outlook Toolbar screen, shown in Figure 10-13, appears.
 
2. Click the Download It Now button and, when the LinkedIn Outlook 
Toolbar Setup Wizard opens, click the Next button. 
 
 The page with the License Agreement appears.
 
3. Review the License Agreement, select the I Accept. . . check box, and 
click the Next button. 
 
4. In the Choose Install Location screen that appears, accept the default 
location (recommended) or pick a new directory to install the toolbar 
program; then, click Install to start the process.
 
 LinkedIn installs all the necessary files for the toolbar onto your com-
puter. Allow at least a few minutes for this process to be completed. 
When the toolbar is installed, a Build Network Wizard window appears.
 
5. Click the Start button and follow the steps to have the toolbar scan 
your Outlook program for contacts.
 
 You can send an Invitation to these contacts to join your LinkedIn network.

If you have already imported your Microsoft Outlook Address Book into 
LinkedIn, going through the Build Network Wizard may not result in a lot of 
new contacts, but this process can find contacts you have not saved to your 
Outlook Address Book.
Using the LinkedIn Browser Toolbar
Do you find yourself going back and forth between LinkedIn and other Web 
sites? Whether you do further research on someone from a general Web 
search by looking up their LinkedIn profile, or you’re actively looking for 
a job and frequently switch between LinkedIn and other career job sites, 
LinkedIn has the tool for you! 
Regardless of whether you use Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla’s 
Firefox Web browser, LinkedIn offers you a toolbar you can install that shows 
up as part of your Web browser and provides you with instant access to the 
LinkedIn Web site. The toolbar also offers integrated functions that give you 
access to items such as profile information with the click of a mouse. 
You can get to the main LinkedIn Browser toolbar page (shown in Figure 
10-14) by clicking the Browser Toolbar link from the Tools menu along the 
bottom of the LinkedIn home page. The following sections tell you how to 
install the toolbar, depending on your browser.

How to install the Internet Explorer toolbar
When you’re ready to install the Internet Explorer toolbar, just follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to LinkedIn, scroll to the bottom of the page, look for a menu 
bar labeled Tools, and click the Browser Toolbar link. 
 
2. Click the Download It Now button under the IE Toolbar header.
 
 A window like the one shown in Figure 10-15 opens, asking whether you 
want to open this installation file directly from the Internet or to save 
the installation file to your computer, where you can run it locally. Pick 
the option best for you and click the appropriate button.
 
 If you have a fast Internet connection, you can click Open to have the toolbar 
installed over your Internet connection. Otherwise, I recommend that you 
save the file to your computer and then run the file from your hard drive. 
 
3. When the LinkedIn Internet Explorer Toolbar Setup Wizard appears, 
click the Next button to start the process. 
 
 Accept the License Agreement and then click the Next button.
 
4. On the Choose Install Location screen that appears, click the Install 
button to accept the default and start the installation of the toolbar.
 
 You can also click the Browse button to pick another directory for the 
toolbar, but the default location should be fine.

 Chapter 10: Using LinkedIn with Your E-Mail and Browser
Creating E-Mail Signatures
One of the best ways to communicate your presence on LinkedIn is to add your 
LinkedIn profile to your e-mail signature, if you’ve created one. Every time you 
send an e-mail, you can have text appear automatically at the end of your mes-
sage similar to a written signature you would put at the end of a letter. Some 
people just sign their name; others use this space as an opportunity to put their 
name and some contact information, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses, 
physical addresses, and, more recently, Web site addresses. Some LinkedIn 
members have been including their profile URL, so anyone getting an e-mail from 
them can take a look at their person profile and learn more about them. 
LinkedIn has decided to develop a cool tool that will allow you to build your 
own advanced e-mail signature using the LinkedIn Web site. You can decide 
what information you want to include in your signature, and LinkedIn helps 
you with formatting, graphics — the entire “look and feel” of your signature. 
You can find the e-mail signature tool by clicking the Tools Overview link at 
the bottom of the LinkedIn home page. When you get to the Tools page, skip 
down below the toolbar sections and look for the Email Signature section 
(which is shown in Figure 10-19).

Part III: Growing and Managing Your Network 
When you’re ready to create your e-mail signature, just follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to LinkedIn, scroll to the bottom of the page, look for a menu 
bar labeled Tools, and click the Overview link. 
 
2. On the Tools Overview page, scroll down to the section on Email 
Signature and click the gray Try It Now button.
 
 When you click the Try It Now button, LinkedIn takes you to a special 
Profile page entitled Create Email Signature. 
 
3. On your Profile page, click the drop-down arrow next to Select Layout 
to pick which Layout option you want.
 
 You have multiple options to select from. Some, such as Ingot or Plastic 
Curve, add a graphical look, whereas a Simple option lists your informa-
tion as text, and the Executive layout presents your information in a 
more professional manner than the simple layouts do. 
 
 Click around and pick a few layouts to see the automatic preview of that 
layout on your screen. This gives you an idea of which layout and color 
scheme you want. You may want to revisit this step after you enter all 
your information so that you know how your finished signature will 
appear.

Figure 10-21: 
Here’s how

4. After you have picked your layout style, you need to enter the contact 
information you want to appear in your signature.
 
 You can input as much or as little as you’d like in the boxes provided 
(see Figure 10-20), and that information will be reflected in your signa-
ture file (see Figure 10-21).
 
5. Add a picture to your signature, if you want, by entering the URL of 
that picture’s location in the box provided under Image Selection.
 
 If you’ve already uploaded a picture of yourself for your LinkedIn profile, 
you can include it here as well. 
 
6. Decide which of three links can appear as part of your signature by 
clicking the appropriate check box(es): 
 
• The Professional Profile link creates a URL link to your LinkedIn 
Profile page. 
 
• The See Who We Know in Common link creates a link to LinkedIn 
that, when a LinkedIn member clicks the link, shows other 
LinkedIn members who are connected to you and that person.
 
• The We’re Hiring link creates a link that takes someone back to 
LinkedIn and starts a Job Search query for job openings in the 
company you’ve listed in your LinkedIn profile.

Click here.
 
 I highly recommend turning on the Professional Profile link. The other 
two links are fine to have as well, especially if you want to promote job 
listings at your own company. 
 
7. Click the Click Here for Instructions link under the Save your Email 
Signature header to create and save your e-mail signature (see Figure 
10-22).
 
 This action results in a pop-up window with your e-mail signature infor-
mation. If you have a pop-up blocker on your Web browser, you may 
want to deactivate it temporarily before performing this step, or be 
ready to temporarily allow pop-ups from LinkedIn.com. 
 
8. When the page with the pop-up window containing the “code” of your 
e-mail signature appears, as shown in Figure 10-22, you can simply 
select all the text in the box and paste it into your favorite e-mail pro-
gram, or you can scroll down and follow the instructions.
 
 LinkedIn provides instructions for the most popular e-mail programs, 
such as Outlook and Yahoo! Mail. Click the drop-down arrow to bring up 
your e-mail program and instructions will appear at the bottom of the 
window, as do the instructions for Outlook Express in Figure 10-23.

Finding 
Employees, Jobs, 
and Services

In this part . . .
I
’m a firm believer in the phrase “Good help is hard to 
find.” I’m not sure why that’s the case, but it seems to 
be tougher and tougher to find someone you can trust 
who can help you out. I could get all philosophical and 
wax poetic about the good ol’ days, when everything cost 
a nickel and you had to hike up the mountain, covered in 
two feet of snow, both ways, to get a jug of milk. But I 
digress. . . .
This part of the book talks specifically about how LinkedIn 
can help you do one of three things: Find a good 
employee, find a job, or find a qualified service profes-
sional, like a graphic designer, an accountant, or even a 
gardener. I provide detailed instructions on how to access 
the Jobs portion of LinkedIn, whether you’re a job seeker 
or an employer, and gear all the functions that LinkedIn 
offers with specific advice on how you accomplish these 
three tasks.

W
hen you have a handle on the key elements of improving your 
LinkedIn profile and experience, it’s time to look outward towards 
the LinkedIn network and talk about some of the benefits you can reap from a 
professional network of tens of millions of people. 
Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking for your first employee, a grow-
ing start-up needing to add a knowledgeable staffer, or a part of a Fortune 
500 company filling a recent opening, LinkedIn can provide a very rich and 
powerful pool of potential applicants and job candidates, including the per-
fectly skilled person who isn’t even looking for a job! One of the benefits of 
LinkedIn, when it comes to looking for an employee, is that you aren’t limited 
to an applicant’s one- or two-page resume and cover letter. Instead, you get 
the full picture of the applicant’s professional history, coupled with recom-
mendations and his knowledge and/or willingness to share information. Even 
if you find your candidate outside LinkedIn, you can use the site to perform 
reference checks and get more information about your candidate. 
In this chapter, I cover the basics of using LinkedIn to find an employee for 
your company or startup. I start with the basics of how you can post your 
job listing on LinkedIn and review your applicants. I then move on to the 
Reference Check function, where you can use LinkedIn to screen potential 
candidates, and I finish the chapter with search strategies you should employ 
to find the right person. 

202
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
Posting a Job Listing
LinkedIn offers a Hiring page for companies to manage their job listings. Click 
the drop-down arrow next to the Jobs link on the top navigation bar on the 
home page, and select Hiring Home to see the Hiring home page, as shown 
in Figure 11-1. This is where you start the process of creating a job listing, 
reviewing the applicants you get, and paying LinkedIn to post the listing. 
 
Figure 11-1: 
LinkedIn 
offers a 
Hiring page 
to manage 
your job 
listings
 
As of this writing, it costs $195 for one standard 30-day job listing on 
LinkedIn. LinkedIn also offers packs of five or ten Job Credits (one Job Credit 
allows you to post one job listing) that reduce the per-listing cost by up to 40 
percent or so. You can pay for your job listing with a major credit card such 
as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. 
 
If you know that you’re going to need multiple or ongoing job postings 
on LinkedIn, you might want to consider LinkedIn Corporate Solutions 
to get discounts on multiple credits for job postings and InMail. You can 
get more information by completing a request at www.linkedin.com/
static?key=corporate_inquiry. 
You can choose to renew your listing at the end of the 30-day window. Your 
date posted (the date you set up the job listing) will be updated with the 
renewal date instead of the original posting date, so the listing will appear at 

203
 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
the top of search results. The cost for renewing a job listing is the same as 
the initial job posting cost. 
 
You can advertise only one open position per job listing. If you solicit appli-
cations for more than one position within a single job listing, LinkedIn will 
remove your listing or require you to purchase multiple job credits. 
Posting a job listing
To post your job opening, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Jobs drop-down arrow in the top navigation bar, and select 
Post a Job. 
 
 You see the Step 1: Compose Job screen, as shown in Figure 11-2. 
 
Figure 11-2: 
Start 
composing 
your job 
posting 
here.
 
 
2. Complete the text boxes provided in the Company Information and 
Job Information sections. 
 
 Provide your company name, job title, function, industry, type, and expe-
rience level. Then, you can compose your job description in the text box 
provided (see Figure 11-3) or copy the description from another source 
and paste it into the box. Just make sure any formatting (like spacing, 
bullet points, font size, and so on) is correct after you paste the text. 

204
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
Figure 11-3: 
Enter the job 
description 
in the text 
box 
provided.
 
 
 If your company or job title isn’t that well known, you should include 
some details about the company or job title in the Job Description field 
as well as the responsibilities and duties of the position. 
 
3. Scroll down and fill in the Location Information and Additional 
Information sections. 
 
 LinkedIn automatically fills in your city, country, and postal code in 
the boxes provided (see Figure 11-4) based on your profile, but you 
should update them if necessary with the location of the position. You 
can select the check boxes under Additional Information to add more 
requirements to the job.
 
 If you’re advertising this job only on LinkedIn, select the check box 
labeled This Job Is Available Exclusively on LinkedIn to get a special star 
next to your listing, which alerts job seekers that the position can only 
be found on LinkedIn.
 
4. Click the Next button to proceed to the Step 2: Contact Information 
page as shown in Figure 11-5. 
 
 You’re asked whether to link your profile to the job listing. Select the 
Yes button to link your profile. Scroll down and identify your hiring role 
(are you a hiring manager, a human resource representative, a recruiter, 
or an employee?) and the e-mail address where you want the job appli-
cations to be sent.

206
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
5. Click the Next button to proceed to the Step 3: Confirmation page as 
shown in Figure 11-6. 
 
 Review all the information you entered from Steps 1 and 2 by scrolling 
through the listing. If you need to make any changes, click the Edit link 
in the appropriate section to go back and correct that part. 
 
6. Select your payment method (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, 
Discover, or a pre-paid Job Credit) and click the Post This Job button. 
 
 If you haven’t already paid for Job Credits, you’re taken to Step 4: 
Payment, where LinkedIn collects and processes your credit card infor-
mation. After that has been done, your listing will be posted to LinkedIn 
Jobs. 
That’s it! You have completed the all-important first step: you posted your 
job listing. Next up, you should use your LinkedIn network members to 
spread the word about your job listing and see who they recommend. 
Advertising your job listing 
to your network
When you send your job posting out to the Internet, you’re hoping that the 
extensive database of job seekers will find the posting and the appropriate 
parties will submit their resumes and cover letters. When you use LinkedIn 
for a job, however, you have a distinct advantage: your own network. You’re 
connected to people who you know and trust, people who you have worked 
with before so you know their capabilities, and most importantly, people who 
know you and (hopefully) have a better idea than the average person as to 
what kind of person you would hire. 
LinkedIn allows you to send all or some of the people in your network a mes-
sage, letting them know about your job opening and asking them if they, or 
anyone they know, might be interested in this job. When you’re ready to 
advertise your job listing, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to Jobs (on the top navigation bar) 
and then select Manage Jobs. 
 
 After you’ve posted your job, you should see the position listed in the 
Manage Jobs window under Open Jobs. Click on that job title to bring up 
the Job Status window for that job listing, as shown in Figure 11-7.
 
2. Click the Tell Your Network! button to generate a LinkedIn message. 
 
 LinkedIn automatically generates a response, as shown in Figure 11-8, 
that you can send out to your network. Feel free to edit the text in the 
message box to make it sound like it’s coming from you, or just leave the 
default message in place.

3. Click the Select Connections button to decide who will get this mes-

 A window opens up with all your connections, as shown in Figure 11-9. 
You can use the options under Narrow Your Connections to reduce the 
list you see in the window. 
 
4. From your Narrow Your Connections window, select the people you 
want to send this message to by clicking the check box next to their 
names, so their names appear in the list on the right. 
 
 You can also select the check box next to “Showing X of X connections” 
to automatically select up to 200 connections from your network. 
 
5. Click the Finished button to return to your message. Look over 
the text in the window again, make sure you have the right people 
selected, and when you’re ready, click the Send button as shown in 
Figure 11-10. 

209
 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
Your LinkedIn connections will receive a message in their LinkedIn inboxes 
and, depending on their notification settings, an e-mail with this message as 
well. They can click a link from the message to see the job listing and either 
apply themselves or forward it to their contacts for consideration.

 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
Reviewing applicants
Once you’ve posted your job listing on LinkedIn, you should expect to get 
some applicants for the position. Every time someone applies for that job, 
you will receive an e-mail from LinkedIn notifying you of their application. In 
addition, LinkedIn records their application in the Applicants section of the 
Job Status page. 
When you are ready to review the applicants for your job, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to Jobs (on the top navigation bar) 
and then select Manage Jobs.
 
 You should be taken to the Manage Jobs: Open Jobs window as shown in 
Figure 11-11. 
 
Figure 11-11: 
Review your 
open job 
listings to 
see who has 
applied. 
 
 
2.  Click the Job Title of the job listing you want to review. 
 
 This brings up the Job Status page for the job listing, as shown in Figure 
11-12. You should see the Applicants listed under the Control Panel sta-
tistics for the job listing.
 
3.  Review the LinkedIn profile, resume, and cover letter for each appli-
cant by clicking on the appropriate link in each line of the applicants 
list. 
 
 Each applicant’s profile, resume, and cover letter are available through 
clicking the designated link. If you scroll down the page, you can see all 
the applicants for the job listing, as shown in Figure 11-13.

The Find references link

213
 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
 
4.  Click the Find references link in an applicant’s summary line to do a 
reference check on that applicant. 
 
 In this example, I am going to attempt a reference check for one of the 
applicants, Kristie Spilios. When I click the Find references link, I am 
taken to a Reference Search Results page, as shown in Figure 11-14. 
LinkedIn displays all the positions in Ms. Spilios’s profile and in the 
search results, highlights the common position between each result 
and Ms. Spilios. This will help you determine if the person in the search 
result worked alongside the applicant or not. 
 
Figure 11-14: 
See who in 
the LinkedIn 
network 
might have 
worked 
with your 
applicant. 
 
 
 At this point, you should go through the search results and look for 
someone you want to request a reference for your applicant. Preferably, 
you want someone who is only two or three degrees away from you 
because then you can use a first-degree connection to introduce your-
self to this person and that might encourage the other person (who is 
two or three degrees away) to respond. 
 
5.  Click the name of a potential reference check and ask her for a recom-
mendation of your applicant. 
 
 When you click the name in the search results, you will bring up the per-
son’s profile. You can use InMail or an Introduction to send a message 
to this person (which I cover in Chapter 5) and you can ask if she has 
worked with your applicant and whether she’s willing to offer her own 
assessment of the person. 

214
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
6.  You can ask for additional recommendations by repeating Steps 4 and 
5 and identifying other individuals who might be able to help.
 
 Since the first person you ask may not respond, you may want to con-
tact additional people in the search results screen, in the hope that one 
person will respond in the necessary timeframe. See the next section of 
this book for some specific reference search and screening techniques.  
Performing Reference Checks and 
Screening Candidates with LinkedIn
When you use LinkedIn to post a job request, the screening part of your 
hiring process clearly benefits from using LinkedIn. Rather than asking for 
references from the applicant and ordering a background check from a ser-
vices company, you can use LinkedIn to verify a lot of the information in 
your applicant’s resume and application at any stage of the process, without 
paying a dime! 
Here are some reference search strategies to keep in mind: 
 
 Start by checking for the applicant’s LinkedIn profile. If the applicant 
has a common name, use additional information from her resume or 
application (such as past jobs, location, or education) to narrow down 
your search. When you find her profile, compare it with her resume or 
application. Is she consistent in how she presents her experience? 
 
 Read through the applicant’s recommendations and follow up. If your 
candidate has received recommendations, go through them and see 
whether it’s applicable towards your open position. Pay attention to rec-
ommendations from former bosses or co-workers. If necessary, ask your 
candidate whether you can contact the recommender through InMail 
and use that person as a reference. 
 
 See whether you’re connected to your candidate. When you pull up 
your candidate’s profile, you will see whether she is a second- or third-
degree network member, which would mean there are one or two people 
who connect you with the candidate. If so, contact that person (or ask 
for an Introduction to reach the correct party) and ask for more informa-
tion about the candidate. Chances are good that you might get a more 
honest assessment from someone you know rather than the recommen-
dations provided by the candidate. 
 
 Evaluate the candidate’s total picture. If your candidate mentions any 
Web sites, blogs, or other Web presences on her LinkedIn profile, click 
the links and see how they’re involved. Take a look at the listed interests 
and group affiliations and see whether they add to (or detract from) 
your picture of the job candidate. 

215
 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
Because most LinkedIn users have already defined each company where they 
worked and the years of employment, LinkedIn offers an interesting and help-
ful application called Reference Search. It works like this: Say you’re evaluat-
ing a candidate who says he worked at Microsoft from 2000 to 2005. You’d 
like to find out whether you know anyone in your immediate or extended net-
work who might have worked with your candidate. LinkedIn scans everyone’s 
profile and looks for matches in the company name and years employed, and 
it shows you who is a possible match. You can then follow up and hopefully 
will get a much more honest, unbiased opinion of the candidate than some-
one the candidate has pre-selected to deliver a glowing recommendation. 
Beware, though, in case you get the ex-employee with an axe to grind. 
There is one catch: you have to have a paid account in order to perform a ref-
erence search. (I discuss the benefits of paid accounts in Chapter 1.) You can 
start your search using a free account, but you will only see a summary of the 
results, and not the full set of results to actually find a reference. 
Performing a reference check is easy; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to People (on the top navigation 
bar) to expand your choices. Click Reference Search to bring up the 
window shown in Figure 11-15.

2. Enter the company name and years of employment in the text boxes 
provided. 
 
 If the candidate is currently working at the company, enter the current 
year in the second year box. You can enter more than one company 
in the boxes provided, and your result list will contain anyone who 
matches at least one of the companies provided. 
 
3. Click the Search button to start the reference search. 
 
 You see a results screen, as shown in Figure 11-16, where your search 
results are sorted by the number of degrees away from you. Therefore, 
first-level contacts show up first, followed by second-level contacts, and 
so on.

with your 
candidate.
 
 
4. Evaluate each profile in your results list to see whether the applicant 
worked in the same division, and if so, contact the person in your 
results list for a reference. 
 
 Obviously, for a big company, like Microsoft in my example, you may 
have to search multiple people to find the right division. 
 
If you add a division name right after the company name (for example, you put 
Microsoft Excel instead of Microsoft), you’re severely limiting your search to 
people who have defined their position in that exact word order.

 Chapter 11: Finding Employees 
Search Strategies for Finding Active 
or Passive Job Seekers
One of the powers of LinkedIn is the ability not just to find the active job 
seeker, but the passive job seeker or someone who didn’t even realize she 
wanted a new job! You can tap an extensive network of professionals who 
have already identified their past experiences, skill set, interests, educational 
backgrounds, and group affiliations. Also, through LinkedIn Answers, you can 
even find out about their thoughts and knowledge. 
The best piece of advice, in my opinion, for this type of search comes from 
Harvey Mackay and the book he wrote back in 1999, whose title is:
“Dig your well before you’re thirsty.” 
You should be building up a healthy network and keeping your eyes on 
potential candidates before you have a job opening to fill. The earlier you 
start, and the more consistent you are with the time you spend on a weekly 
or monthly basis expanding your network, the easier it is to identify and then 
recruit a potential candidate to fill your opening. 
There are specific steps you should take to make your strategy a reality. 
Whether you start this process in advance or just need to fill a position as 
soon as possible, here are some tactics to consider: 
 
 Perform detailed advanced searches. If you want the perfect candidate, 
search for that candidate. Put multiple keywords in the advanced search 
form, look for a big skill set, narrow your search to a specific industry, 
and maybe even limit your range to people who already live close to 
you. If you come up with zero results, remove the least necessary key-
word and repeat the search, and keep doing that until you come up with 
some potentials. 
 
 Focus on your industry. If you know that you’re probably going to need 
software developers, start getting to know potential candidates on 
the site and stay in touch with them. Look for people to connect with, 
whether they share a group affiliation with you or respond to LinkedIn 
Answers, and actively network with these people. Even if they say no 
to a future job opportunity, chances are good that someone in their 
networks will be more responsive than the average connection. While 
Software Developer A may say no, that person probably has several soft-
ware developers in their network who could respond favorably. 

218
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 Read the LinkedIn Answers section. If you’re looking for outgoing 
people who love sharing their knowledge and want to see a sample 
of how they approach a problem, take a look at the Answers section. 
Search for questions that involve something in your industry and read 
all the answers to find potential candidates who impress you.
 
 Ask your own questions in the LinkedIn Answers section. After you’ve 
read through the questions, ask one yourself! Pose a question that 
you would ask in an interview to potential candidates, and see who 
responds. Better yet, you’ll see how the people respond, and you’ll be 
able to decide from their answers who to focus on for a follow-up. You’ll 
be able to see the public profiles of the people who provide answers and 
send those people who respond messages.

O
ne of the most important ways that LinkedIn has benefitted people’s 
lives is how it helps to improve their job search experience. Before 
LinkedIn, everyone remembers what was involved when you had a job 
search — making lots of phone calls and visits (and some e-mails) to people 
you knew, asking them whether they knew anybody who was hiring, asking 
whether they knew somebody at Company X who might talk to you, or asking 
something else related to your search. It was a tedious and inefficient pro-
cess, but now LinkedIn has improved it. Understand, however, that LinkedIn 
hasn’t replaced the entire process. You still need to do some face-to-face 
meetings and phone calls, but LinkedIn can help you find the right person 
before you pick up the phone. 
In this chapter, I discuss some of the ways that you can use LinkedIn to help 
find a job, whether you’re an active job seeker (I need a job right now!) or 
a passive job seeker (I don’t mind where I’m at, but if the right opportunity 
comes along, I’m listening) on the market. I start by talking about LinkedIn’s 
job board and how you can search for openings. Then I move into more 
strategic options like improving your profile, devising specific strategies, 
searching your network for specific people, and incorporating functions like 
LinkedIn’s JobsInsider tool when surfing the Internet.

Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
Searching for a Job by Using LinkedIn
LinkedIn offers lots of tools that can help you look for a job. The most direct 
way is to search for open positions on LinkedIn’s job board, which I cover in 
the following section. There are other things to keep in mind when looking 
for a job, which I cover in the later sections, like improving your visibility 
and optimizing your profile. Part of the success of finding a job is to have an 
appealing LinkedIn identity so hiring managers can find you and want to con-
tact you with an opening. After all, the best search is when someone comes 
to you with an opportunity without you sweating the details.
Searching for an open position
The most obvious way to look for a job is to look through LinkedIn’s adver-
tised job openings. After all, someone is getting hired when a company runs a 
job listing, so why can’t that candidate be you? When you search for a job on 
LinkedIn, you can see what skills and positions companies are hiring, which 
you can keep in mind as you refine your job search and LinkedIn profile. 
When you’re ready to search for a job opening, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Jobs drop-down arrow from the top navigation bar, and 
select Advanced Job Search.
 
 The Advanced Job Search page appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
2. Enter keywords describing the job you want in the Search For text box 
provided.
 
 To be more precise in your search, you can enter additional criteria in 
the sections below the Search For text box, such as location, specific job 
title or company, or job function or industry. 
 
3. When you’re done entering criteria, click the Search button.
 
 You’re taken to a LinkedIn Jobs results screen like the one shown in 
Figure 12-2, where you see the basic components of the job listings, like 
Title, Company, and Location. What’s unique to LinkedIn (compared to 
other job listing sites like Monster.com) is the last column: Posted By. 
This column shows you who within that company posted the job, and it 
provides a link to view that person’s LinkedIn profile. Furthermore, if the 
job poster is in your extended network, you see her name and degree of 
connection to you, and she is automatically sorted to the top of the list.

 If you want to expand your job results, click the tab labeled The Web 
next to the LinkedIn Jobs tab above the table of job titles, companies, 
and so on, in Figure 12-2. This shows you the results of searching all job 
listings that have been aggregated from all over the Internet through a 
company called SimplyHired. 
 
4. Click an individual job title to see the details of that job posting. 
 
 You see the detailed write-up on the next screen as shown in Figure 12-3, 
where you can find out more about the job and the job poster. If the 
person who posted the job is in your network and has opted to show 
her name, you can click the See Who Connects You link to find out how 
to use LinkedIn to reach that person.

5. When you see a job you want to apply for, click the Apply Now button. 
 
 In most cases, LinkedIn takes you to the job application form, as shown in 
Figure 12-4. (In some cases, you’re taken to the company’s specific appli-
cant tracking system — for instance, any job from Google does this. In 
those cases, simply follow the instructions displayed to apply for that job.)
 
6. Write a cover letter (or cut and paste one from your word processing 
program) in the text box provided.

223
 Chapter 12: Finding a Job 
 
 You should write a brief summary of why you feel you are qualified for 
the job in the text box provided. If you like, you can update and reuse 
an older cover letter you’ve used to apply to a similar job: Simply open 
a word processing program (such as Microsoft Word), find the letter, 
copy the contents, and paste it into the text box here on LinkedIn. 
 
Figure 12-4: 
Start 
applying 
for a job on

 If the job poster is in your extended network, I recommend that you read 
her profile first, see what common interests you have, and incorporate 
that information into your cover letter. If you have the time, approach that 
person first with an Introduction or InMail to get some more information 
about the job posting before you apply.
 
7. Scroll down and enter your contact information in the text boxes pro-
vided as shown in Figure 12-5. 
 
8. Click the Browse button to find a copy of your resume on your com-
puter to be uploaded into the job application. 
 
9. Scroll down and click the Next button to review your application. 
Then click the Submit Application button. 
 
 You see all the details you entered as shown in Figure 12-6, so make sure 
they’re all correct before you submit the application. 
Congratulations! You’ve applied for a job. Repeat the preceding Steps 2–9 to 
keep looking and apply for future jobs.

 Chapter 12: Finding a Job 
Improving your visibility 
and attractiveness
When you’re looking for a job, the manual acts of scanning job listings and 
sending in resumes are only part of the process. You also have to prepare 
your job-seeking strategies. The most obvious examples of these are your 
resume (or CV) and your cover letter. When you include LinkedIn in your job 
search, you need to prepare your total LinkedIn profile and network in order 
to get the optimal job search experience. 
Although no strategy can 100-percent positively guarantee the job of your 
dreams, these strategies can improve your odds of getting that right contact 
person, interview, or extra consideration for your job application that’s in a 
stack of potential candidates. 
Here are some strategies to keep in mind: 
 
 Connect with former managers, co-workers, and partners. This may 
seem like an obvious strategy, but let me elaborate. Part of getting the 
job is communicating (to your future employer) your ability to do the 
job. Nobody knows your skills, your potential, your work attitude and 
capability, better than people who have worked with you and observed 
you in action. 
 
 Therefore, make sure that you have connected with your former manag-
ers, co-workers, and so on. When these people are part of your network, 
the Introductions they can facilitate will carry extra weight because they 
can share their experience with the person you want to meet. You can 
encourage them to provide recommendations for you to express to the 
entire community your capability and work ethic. 
 
 Look at colleague’s LinkedIn profiles. Using the search functions or 
your first-degree connections in your network, try to find people with 
goals and work experience similar to yours. When you see how they 
describe their work experience on their profiles, you might get some 
good ideas on how to augment your profile. 
 
 Get referrals from past bosses and co-workers. After you’ve added your 
past bosses and co-workers to your network, keep in contact with them, 
let them know your current job search goals, and ask for an appropriate 
referral or Introduction. They can use their knowledge of your work his-
tory and their expanded networks to make more powerful Introductions 
or requests than just a friend asking another friend, ‘Hey, can you hire 
my friend Joel?’ 

226
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 Don’t be afraid to provide extra information to your past bosses or co-
workers to help them make an effective referral. Before the Internet, 
when job seekers asked a past boss or co-worker to write a letter of rec-
ommendation, it was acceptable to include some bullet points of stories 
or points you hoped they would cover in their letters. The same is true 
in the LinkedIn world. Guide your contact to emphasize a work quality 
or anecdote that would be effective in the referral or Introduction.
 
 Collect your Recommendations. Nothing communicates a vote of 
confidence from your network quite like a Recommendation. When 
anyone reads your LinkedIn profile, he can see exactly what other 
people have said about you. Because he knows that you can’t alter a 
Recommendation, he’s more likely to trust the content and believe 
you’re the right person for the job. (See Chapter 8 for more information 
on how to get more Recommendations.) 
 
 Use LinkedIn Answers to demonstrate your experience and knowl-
edge. Your network of connections has an idea of your knowledge and 
capabilities, but what about everybody else out there? If someone is 
evaluating you for a job, she’ll probably access your LinkedIn profile to 
learn more about you, so the more your profile can say about you at any 
given point in time, the better. One way you can improve your overall 
presence is to participate in LinkedIn Answers. You can share knowl-
edge you’ve gained by answering other LinkedIn member’s questions 
and providing advice. All of your replies to questions posted on LinkedIn 
Answers are available from your profile. (See Chapter 7 for more infor-
mation on how to use LinkedIn Answers.) 
Optimizing your LinkedIn profile
The core of your LinkedIn presence is your profile, which is included with 
every job application you make on LinkedIn. Odds are good that prospec-
tive employers are going to check your LinkedIn profile when evaluating you 
for a job, so you want to make sure your profile is optimized to make you as 
appealing as possible to your prospective employer. Here are some things to 
keep in mind when bulking up your profile for a job search:
 
 Complete all the sections in your profile with as much accurate infor-
mation as possible. It’s easy to put up a skeleton of your employment 
history and never get around to fully completing your profile. Unlike 
a resume (where you could feel confined in terms of page length), you 
can be as expansive as you want with your LinkedIn profile. You never 
know what part of your profile will get you included in someone’s search 
result, but the more information you provide, the better chance some-
one will find you. 

227
 Chapter 12: Finding a Job 
 
 Focus on accomplishments rather than duties. I’ve seen a lot of people 
prepare their LinkedIn profiles in the same way they do their resumes, 
focusing solely on the duties they performed at each job. Although you 
want to give people an idea of what you did, hiring managers want to 
know the results of what you did, and the more concrete the example, 
the better. Saying you “organized procurement processes in your divi-
sion” may demonstrate a skill, but saying that you “cut procurement 
costs by 16% in your first year” carries a bigger impact. Go back and 
talk to past co-workers or bosses, if necessary, to get whatever specifics 
they can provide on your performance. 
 
 Add all relevant job search keywords, skill sets, and buzzwords to 
your profile. When prospective employers are searching for someone 
to hire, they may simply search for a core set of skills to see who can fill 
the position. Therefore, just stating your job titles is not enough. If your 
profile says “Software Developer,” prospective hiring managers could 
assume that you’re qualified, but the only way you’d be considered is if 
these managers did a search for “Software Developer.” What happens 
if a hiring manager does a search for the programming languages C++, 
Java, Perl, and Python? If all of those keywords are not somewhere in 
your profile, you won’t show up in the list to be considered at all. 
 
 See how other people position themselves. Imagine if you could get a 
book of thousands of resumes from current employees that you could 
then use as models to position yourself. Do a search for people with a 
job, education, or skill set similar to yours and see how they’ve worded 
their profiles or how they put their experiences in context. Use that 
insight to adapt your profile to make it clearer to others. 
 
 List all of your job experiences on your profile, not just full-time posi-
tions. Did you do any short-term or contract jobs? Were you an advisor 
to another company? Perhaps you’re a board member for a local non-
profit group or religious organization. Your LinkedIn profile is designed 
to reflect all of your job experiences, which is not limited to a full-time job 
that provided a W2 slip. Document any work experience that adds to your 
overall profile, whether you were paid for that job/experience or not. 
Auditioning with Answers
There are several benefits to actively using 
LinkedIn Answers. Not only can people see 
examples of your knowledge or experience by 
reading your answers, they get an idea of how 
helpful or enthusiastic you are in a professional 
environment. After all, most employers want to 
know that you will be a healthy addition to a 
team and that you’ll communicate well with co-
workers and think about the big picture. Your 
active involvement in LinkedIn Answers shows 
an employer that you’re willing to help others 
to achieve their goals. They also get a glimpse 
into your communication and written skills, 
which are important in many jobs today. When 
you give with LinkedIn Answers, you receive as 
well. 

228
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
Make sure that every experience you list on your profiles helps contribute to 
your overall career goals. After all, employers may not care that you were a 
pastry chef one summer and will question why you thought it was so impor-
tant that you listed it on your profile. 
Job Search Strategies Using LinkedIn
When you’re looking for a job, there are a lot of potential ways you can 
include LinkedIn as part of your overall job search, beyond the direct task 
of searching their jobs database listings and e-mailing a job request to your 
immediate network. In this section, I discuss various job search strategies 
you can implement that involve LinkedIn to some degree and can help add 
information, contacts, interviews, and hopefully some offers to your job 
search. Use one or use them all, but pick the methods you feel most comfort-
able with implementing. 
 
Remember that a job search should be treated as a full-time job. Some of these 
strategies involve a long-term commitment and might not instantly result in 
multiple offers. 
Leveraging your connections
One of the biggest benefits of LinkedIn is being able to answer the question, 
“Who do my contacts know?” It’s important to think of LinkedIn as not only 
the sum of your first-degree immediate connections, but your extended net-
work of second- and third-degree network members that your colleagues can 
help connect you with for information, referrals, and hopefully, a new career. 
Therefore, it’s important to keep these second- and third-degree network mem-
bers in mind so you can best leverage your connections to get progress. Keep 
these points in mind when you’re working on your job search using LinkedIn:
 
 Change the Sorted By option to Degrees Away from You, or Degrees 
and Recommendations. When searching for the right contacts, like 
recruiters, headhunters, or company or job specialists, be sure to 
change the Sorted By option from Keyword Relevance to another option 
based on Degrees. This allows you to see which members of your 
extended network should be at the top of your list. 
 
 Ask for referrals whenever possible. Exchange information first and 
then work your way up to request a referral. 
 
 Get your friends involved. Let your immediate network know about 
your goals so they can recommend the right people for you to talk to, 
and hopefully they’ll generate the right Introductions for you as well. 

229
 Chapter 12: Finding a Job 
Same title, different place
If you’re looking for a specific job, one way to approach your job search is to 
ask this question: Who is going to know that job better than other people doing 
the same job? This means one source of help should be people with the same 
(or very similar) job title or responsibilities. Although these people may not 
have hiring authority, they can help give you the right perspective, share the 
right insider tips about what the job truly entails, and let you know what skills 
or background the hiring manager considered when they were hired. 
Because these people are already employed and not your direct competition, 
they’re more likely to offer help and advice. They have practical knowledge 
of what it takes to do that job and what qualities will best help someone suc-
ceed in that position. When you’re ready to implement this strategy, just 
keep these points in mind: 
 
 Perform an advanced search for people with a similar job title as the one 
you’re applying for. Put the job title in either the keywords section or 
the title section. 
 
 Narrow and clarify your search by industry. For example, Project Manager 
of Software Development is much different than Project Manager for the 
Construction industry. Pick multiple industries if they are similar enough. 
 
 When you find someone who has the job title you’d like to have, see 
whether she’s interested in meeting for an informational interview. Asking 
outright for a job lead will most likely not result in anything positive. 
All about the alma mater
Typically, people who share a school in common have an ongoing affinity, 
whether the school is an undergraduate or graduate college, or even a high 
school. You can rapidly increase the chance of someone considering your 
request if you and that person attended the same school. Therefore, take 
advantage of your alumni status and try to connect and work with people 
who went to one of the same schools as you. Here are some tips to help fur-
ther this type of search by using LinkedIn: 
 
 Search for Alumni Association Groups of any school you attended by 
clicking the Groups Directory from the expanded left navigation menu 
and join those groups. This gives you access to the member list of that 
group, so you can see other alumni, regardless of graduation year, and 
communicate with them.
 
 Connect as a former classmate and ask for information first, referral 
second. Your shared alumni status will help open the door, but don’t 
expect a golden handout right away. Be ready to offer one of your con-
tacts in exchange for the former classmate’s help or consideration.

230
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 Use the Finding Former Classmates function available in Add 
Connections to look for classmates from the schools in your profile. (I 
discuss how to use this function back in Chapter 6.) You should expand 
your range of graduation years to include some years before and after 
your graduation date. This allows you to find classmates you may have 
met who were in different grades or levels in their study but may have 
shared classes or study time with you. 
 
 Check the connection list of any of your contacts who attended school 
with you. This is a good safety check to see whether there are any class-
mates on your contacts’ lists that you might not have initially considered. 
 
 Try doing an advanced search with the school name as a keyword, 
and if necessary, try different variations of the school name. For 
example, try the school name with and without acronyms. When I look 
for classmates from the University of California, Irvine, I search for the 
term UCI, as well as University California Irvine. (I talk more about doing 
advanced searches in Chapter 4.)
 
 If your school has changed or updated its name, search for both the 
old and new names. For example, because my department name at UCI 
has changed from the Graduate School of Management, or GSM, to the 
Paul Merage School of Business, I will search for both the old and new 
search terms, because my classmates may have defined their educa-
tional listings differently.
Finding target company referrals
Sometimes, your job search involves a specific company and not necessarily a 
job title. Suppose you know you want to work at one of the top computer data-
base software companies. Now, you can use LinkedIn to help you find the right 
people at those companies that can help you. Here are some points to consider: 
 
 Make a list of the ten companies you’d like to work for and do an 
advanced search for each one. Put the company name in the Company 
field and select the check box labeled Current Companies Only. For larger 
companies, you need to search for a specific department or industry area 
to find the right contact. See who you know that works in those companies 
by sorting by Degrees Away from You. Ask these people you’ve identified 
for referrals to someone in your target organization like a hiring manager.
 
 You can even skip a step by changing the Interested In field from the 
default option of All Users to the Hiring Managers option. This way, your 
search produces only hiring managers in your extended network.

231
 Chapter 12: Finding a Job 
 
 If you can’t find someone who currently works at your target com-
pany, look for people who used to work there and see what advice 
they can give you. You do this through an advanced search where you 
deselect the check box labeled Current Companies Only. Many times, 
past employees still maintain contacts at their old company, and they 
can definitely attest to the work environment and corporate culture.
 
 Get some information from the person you’re replacing. Find the 
person at the company whose job you’re taking and ask her for her 
opinion of it, information about the hiring manager, company, and so 
on. If you can’t find the person you’re replacing, try looking for people 
with a past position like the one you’re interviewing for. I got this tip 
from Garage.com founder Guy Kawasaki in his blog post entitled “How 
to Change the World: Ten Ways to use LinkedIn,” which resides on 
http://blog.guykawasaki.com. 
Using the LinkedIn JobsInsider
As more and more people were using LinkedIn to get the inside track on their 
job searches, LinkedIn saw the value in providing a tool that gave search-
ers easy access to the right information that would aid the job search. So 
the folks at LinkedIn developed a tool called JobsInsider that works with the 
major job search engines by scanning a job listing for the employer’s name 
and then providing a summary of statistics of employees that work at that 
company and how they’re connected to a given LinkedIn user. 
After the people at LinkedIn developed the JobsInsider tool, they decided to 
incorporate it into their browser toolbars so it became an automatic benefit. 
After all, you can’t search a job site like Monster.com without a Web browser, 
right? The toolbars are designed to augment a Web search with LinkedIn infor-
mation, and so is JobsInsider, which makes it a logical addition to the toolbar. 
JobsInsider benefits
Your job search is a job unto itself, so any tool that can help you do your 
“job” is definitely an asset. JobsInsider helps expand your regular job search 
by giving you the insight of your LinkedIn network and job database to make 
you a better and more effective job applicant. 
Some of the benefits of the JobsInsider tool are
 
 It’s automatic. After you install the browser toolbar, the JobsInsider 
tool activates itself automatically anytime you use your Web browser 
to navigate to any major job site, like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, 
HotJobs, craigslist, SimplyHired, Dice, or Vault. 

232
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 It’s informative. You get several pieces of valuable information that 
update automatically depending on the job listing you’re seeing. You see 
how many people work at the target company that are in your extended 
network, how many people are friends of your connections (which 
means they’re second-degree connections) and how many people live 
in your region, (like the San Francisco Bay area or the Greater San Diego 
area). Clicking any of those links opens a window to LinkedIn with a 
search result showing you their profile summaries. 
 
 It’s free. No monthly cost, no registration cost, no setup fee. Regardless 
of the status of your LinkedIn account, this tool is free to install and use. 
 
 It’s timesaving. As you search for a job, instead of stopping your search 
from a job site to go to LinkedIn to find a contact or more information, you 
can access that information concurrently through new panes or windows 
opening. 
Using JobsInsider
If you’re interested in using JobsInsider, you need to download one of 
the LinkedIn Browser toolbars and install it on your computer because 
JobsInsider is available only as part of a Browser toolbar. I cover installing 
the Internet Explorer and Firefox Companion toolbars in Chapter 10. 
After you install the toolbar, whenever you go to one of the main job search 
sites (like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, or Dice) a side pane or new 
window opens, where you can basically start a LinkedIn job search. 
For example, suppose that you’re on Monster.com looking for a project man-
ager position. After you start a search and come up with a results screen (as 
shown Figure 12-7), you see the JobsInsider function come up. 
More importantly, however, when you click an individual job posting, you see 
the JobsInsider pane fill in with information on who you know at the hiring 
company and how many people you’re connected to who can help. 
If you can’t easily identify the employer from the job listing, or if the company’s 
name is withheld or confidential, no information shows up in the JobsInsider pane.
Suppose I click a Web developer position at eBay. My JobsInsider pane 
shows me precise connection information, as shown in Figure 12-8. I can click 
on any of the numbers to bring up a people search of hiring managers who 
can help me apply for this job. 
JobsInsider can also be used to search for people, like the hiring manager for 
a job you find on another job site, so you can research that person and write 
a better cover letter or get an Introduction.

 Searching for a service provider
 Writing an excellent recommendation
 Recommending a service provider
T
wo of the main reasons people search the LinkedIn network are to find a 
job or new employee. And now there’s an up-and-coming tool that takes 
advantage of the millions of self-employed people who use LinkedIn to pro-
mote not only themselves, but their services. 
LinkedIn now has a Service Provider section, where LinkedIn members can 
write recommendations for service providers they have personally used that 
are also members of the LinkedIn network. Because recommendations are 
one of the top reasons someone picks one service provider over another, and 
because many of these service providers are on LinkedIn already to increase 
their contact base and professional network, it makes sense to allow members 
to recommend each other based on services, not just shared employment. 
In this chapter, I cover how to use LinkedIn to search for a recommended ser-
vice provider. I also cover how you can file a recommendation for a service 
provider and get him or her listed in the directory. 
Searching for a Service Provider
When you need to hire someone to do a specific job, you probably open 
up the Yellow Pages and search for a provider. Sometimes, you call family 
members or friends and ask them to refer you to somebody qualified. Now, 
LinkedIn has a way for you to search your network of first-, second-, and 
third-degree contacts, or the greater LinkedIn network, to find qualified pro-
fessionals referred by other LinkedIn members. 

236
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
To search for a service provider, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to Companies from the top navigation 
bar, then click the Service Providers link. 
 
2. The Service Provider Recommendations home page appears, as shown 
in Figure 13-1. 
 
 LinkedIn automatically picks providers based on recent recommenda-
tions. If you scroll down the page, you see some of the Top people in 
different categories, like Top Real Estate Agents and Top Child Care 
Providers. (“Top” is defined as providers that have received the most 
recommendations from other LinkedIn users so far.)
 
Figure 13-1: 
Start your 
Service 
Provider 
search here. 
 
 
3. In the Categories pane, click the category that matches the type of ser-
vice provider for your search. 
 
 For this example, I’m searching for a Writer/Editor, so I click Writer/
Editor. You should see the recommendations page for Writer/Editor, as 
shown in Figure 13-2. 
Now that you’ve reached a page loaded with recommended service provid-
ers, you might want to use some of the following tricks to navigate it and find 
the one that’s just right for you: 

237
 Chapter 13: Finding Professional Services
 
 Sorting based on date or top results: By default, the list that’s returned 
is sorted based on the date of the most recent recommendation. You can 
change the sort by clicking the Top Results link, to find a list of Writers/
Editors with the most recommendations, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
 Sorting by recommendations from your network: Click the icon marked 
1st or 2nd to get a list of service provider recommendations based on 
the first- or second-degree connections in your network. 
 
 You see something like what’s shown in Figure 13-4. The list of results 
shows who made the most recent recommendation. 
 
 Sorting based on location: Click the Change Location link to get a tar-
geted search list close to where you live. 
 
 When you click the Change Location link, you’re asked to input your 
country and postal code. After you do so, you are returned to the search 
results page, but with a target list now sorted by the proximity to your 
new location setting. After all, if you are looking for a dentist or gar-
dener, you probably want one close to home. 
 
 Reading all of a provider’s recommendations: Click any provider’s 
name to read all of that provider’s recommendations.

 Chapter 13: Finding Professional Services
Recommending a Service Provider
The flip side of looking for a good service provider is sharing your experi-
ences and recommending somebody you’ve hired or worked with. The 
success of the LinkedIn database depends on sharing this expertise, which 
simply makes a better network for you to enjoy and benefit from. Before you 
enter that recommendation, however, you need to keep a few things in mind 
to make that write-up stand out. 
Planning a good recommendation
When you’ve received excellent service, it’s time to consider how you’ll rec-
ommend someone. For your recommendation to have some weight and give 
prospective customers a good idea of what this provider can accomplish, 
you need to think about the type of recommendation you plan to leave and 
make sure that you cover or emphasize the appropriate things. You have a 
3,000 character count limit, but you also don’t want to provide a long thesis 
of why provider X is the best on Earth. 
Instead, you want to provide a concise, factual testimonial that conveys your 
recommendation in a way that will make sense to the reader and validate the 
provider’s abilities. Here are some things to keep in mind:
 
 Stick to the basics: Although you may want to gush and go on and on 
about why this provider is the best, anybody reading this will lose 
interest and stop reading, which hurts the provider’s chance of getting 
new business and makes you, the recommender, look unprofessional. 
Provide summaries of your experience, highlighting the most important 
aspects. 
 
 Lead with the most important info: Most people don’t read beyond the 
first sentence. Therefore, you want your introductory sentence to give 
a complete picture of the person you’re recommending. This way, you 
hook your reader into finding out why this person is so qualified and 
deserves his or her business. 
 
 Give examples/accomplishments: Saying someone is a hard worker or 
very intelligent is nice, but if that’s all you say, someone reading your 
recommendation might wonder whether this is just your opinion or fact. 
When you give specific examples of the provider’s accomplishments, you 
provide a measurable aspect that readers can relate to and help prove 
the quality of that provider. Who would you hire: someone whose recom-
mendation says, “Great accountant,” or someone whose recommendation 
says, “Paul balanced my business receipts and records in 3–4 hours and 
found me $4,000 in extra deductions for last year’s tax returns”? 

240
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 Be a little personal: In the end, no matter how qualified somebody is, 
people typically hire someone they enjoy working with on a project. 
Therefore, after you mention a person’s great capabilities and accom-
plishments, be sure to include some personal experiences on what 
working with this person was like. “I have been Alex’s client for the past 
5 years, and I am consistently pleased and amazed at the service he has 
provided.” 
Posting a recommendation
When you have your recommendation planned out, it’s time to show it to the 
world. To leave a recommendation, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to Companies from the top navigation 
bar, then click the Service Providers link.
 
2. On the Service Providers page that appears, click the Make a 
Recommendation tab. 
 
 You’re taken to the first step in the process (see Figure 13-5), where you 
have to decide who you want to recommend. 
 
3. Enter the first name, last name, and e-mail address in the box 
provided, or click the Select from Your Connections List link to find 
someone in your network. 
 
Figure 13-5: 
Decide who 
you want to 
recommend.
 

241
 Chapter 13: Finding Professional Services
 
4. After you’ve entered the contact info, click the Continue button to 
proceed. 
 
 You’re taken to the Create Your Recommendation page (see Figure 13-6). 
 
5. From the first drop-down list, select the position this service provider 
had when you hired him. 
 
6. Select an option from the Service Category drop-down list; then select 
the year you first hired or worked with him from the Year First Hired 
drop-down list. 
 
7. If you’ve worked with this person more than once, select the check 
box next to the Year First Hired drop-down list. 
 
Figure 13-6: 
Create your 
Service 
Provider

dation.
 
 
8. Scroll down and pick the top three attributes that best describe the 
service provider. 
 
 You can select up to three check boxes from the list provided. 
Remember, you will have a chance for a Written Recommendation in the 
next step.
 
9. Scroll down and write your written recommendation in the text box 
provided. 

242
Part IV: Finding Employees, Jobs, and Services 
 
 This is the space where you can talk about your provider’s accomplish-
ments, qualities, and your experience working with him. (See the previ-
ous section for what to focus on in your written recommendation.) You 
simply enter this recommendation in the box provided (see Figure 13-7). 
 
Figure 13-7: 
Provide 
your written

dation in 
the box 
provided.
 
 
10. Click the Send button to enter your recommendation into the system. 
 
 You see a confirmation message that your service provider recommen-
dation has been created. 
 
If you’ve already left a personal recommendation for this person, you now 
have two recommendations on this person’s profile, with the only visible dif-
ference being the Top Qualities line in the Service Provider recommendation. 
You may want to delete your old personal recommendation if it overlaps with 
your new one.

for the square peg that no one thought of? Some see that 
as stubborn, but others see that as curious. It’s good to 
wonder how to use something beyond its stated or obvi-

This part covers some of the specific applications of the 
LinkedIn Web site that may not be the obvious, but are 
definitely useful. I apply the LinkedIn Web site to situa-

about how LinkedIn can help you increase your sales, how 
you can use LinkedIn to market yourself, how LinkedIn 
can help you close a big deal, and why that square peg

hen it comes to the reasons that people get to know each other, 
there’s more to a professional’s life than his or her colleagues and 
classmates. People have always been drawn to groups based on a common 
interests, backgrounds, or goals, and this natural tendency to join together 
can be seen from the sports teams to Boy/Girl Scouts, from social action 
organizations to non-profit charity groups. Naturally, LinkedIn also offers a 
way for people to connect with each other as a group, and it’s called LinkedIn 
Groups.
In this chapter, I discuss the overall idea and structure of LinkedIn Groups 
and what you can expect to find. I then talk about how to search for exist-
ing groups on LinkedIn, and I walk you through the steps necessary to join 
that group. Finally, if you see that there should be a group for something on 
LinkedIn but it doesn’t already exist, I discuss how to start your own LinkedIn 
group and how to invite others to join it.

Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
LinkedIn Groups — What They Are and 
What They Aren’t
When people who are familiar with other social networking tools are first 
exposed to LinkedIn Groups, they’re often in for a bit of a surprise. They 
aren’t like Yahoo! Groups or groups on most other social networking sites, 
because there’s no group interaction — no mailing list, no discussion forum, 
and so on. Being a member of a LinkedIn group has some benefits over other 
networking sites:
 
 Connections: Fellow group members are a special sort of connec-
tion. Although you don’t have access to their extended networks for 
Introductions, you’re considered directly connected to them, such 
that you can see their full profiles and they can appear in your search 
results, even if you aren’t within three degrees of everyone in the group. 
If you sort search results by degrees of separation from you, fellow 
group members appear between your first and second degree contacts.
 
 Visibility: By joining several groups — particularly large, open ones — 
you can increase your visibility in the LinkedIn network without having 
to add thousands of contacts.
 
 Group logos: The logos of the groups you’re in are displayed on your 
profile and in search results. This is a sort of visual branding, reinforcing 
your association with those groups without a lot of words. For example, 
Figure 14-1 shows how a LinkedIn member who belongs to several 
groups might appear in a search result.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Group logos 
displayed on

247
 Chapter 14: Getting Connected with LinkedIn Groups
Some LinkedIn Groups are extensions of existing organizations, whereas 
others are created on LinkedIn by an individual as a way to identify and net-
work with people who share a common interest. In either case, they’re useful 
tools for growing your network and leveraging your existing affiliations.
Types of LinkedIn Groups
Because there are lots of reasons to create a group, LinkedIn has established 
the following six primary categories of groups: 
 
 Alumni: These groups are alumni associations created by schools or 
teaching institutions as a means to keep in touch with past graduates. 
Graduates can also keep in touch with each other through an alumni 
group. As you develop your career, you can tap into the alumni network 
of like-minded, qualified individuals. Loyalty to your alma mater makes 
you, and everyone else in the group, more likely to help out a school-
mate than a complete stranger.
 
 Corporate: Because every company has its own unique culture, who better 
to understand that culture than current and past employees? Corporate 
groups allow employees from a single employer to stay in touch. 
 
 Conference: As conference attendees plan to attend a particular con-
ference, using a conference group to network with attendees before, 
during, and after the conference can be advantageous. 
 
 Before the conference, you can relay important information, such as 
subject matter and agenda, and any events, lectures, seminars, parties, 
or other info that matters to the attendees. Perhaps there are last-
minute changes or announcements that need to get disseminated 
quickly. During the event, you can quickly relay announcements, as well 
as news being generated at the conference and any on-site changes. 
After the conference, these conference groups allow attendees to stay in 
contact and help the conference organizers and presenters to see how 
the subject matter and industries have changed or progressed. 
 
 Also, as the conference becomes a yearly event, the conference group 
becomes a constant area of discussion and planning.
 
 Networking: A common interest is all that’s needed to come together and 
meet similarly minded people. Networking groups are organized around 
concepts like women’s networks, angel investors in new companies, or 
even Rotary Clubs. These LinkedIn groups allow you to stay involved in 
your interests and meet people with similar or complementary goals to 
your own.

248
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Non-profit: After talking business all day, it’s comforting to have a group 
where you can talk and plan any upcoming events that benefit your 
favorite non-profit organization. These LinkedIn groups allow far-flung 
volunteers to organize, plan, and execute projects and events relating 
to their charity without being in the same room — which is especially 
convenient if everybody has a busy schedule. These groups also allow 
any non-profit organizers to bring new members up to speed and answer 
their questions quickly so more people become involved. 
 
 Professional: Finally, who knows your career issues better than others 
in your industry and/or job title? Professional groups allow you to net-
work with people in the same type of work who are probably experienc-
ing the same issues, problems, and potential solutions as you. Whether 
it’s an organization of CFOs, workers in the wireless industry, or SAP 
Certified Consultants, these groups can be invaluable to further your 
career and give you an avenue to evaluate job tips and industry news.
Joining a Group
When you look at the LinkedIn groups out there, one of the most important 
things to keep in mind is that you should join only groups that are relevant to 
you. Although you might think it to be fun to join another alumni association 
group besides your alma mater, it won’t really help you in the long run. 
As you use LinkedIn more and decide that you want to get involved by joining 
a LinkedIn group, you have a couple of options for getting started: 
 
 You can click the Group logo found on the profile of one of your first-
degree connections in order to join the group yourself. 
 
 You can search the LinkedIn Groups directory to find a group that 
interests you; then click the logo to join the group. 
The first option may come about when you’re browsing your first-degree con-
nections list and you see a group that you’re interested in joining. After you 
click the logo, you simply have to click a Join this Group button on the next 
page that you see, and you have completed the process. 
When you’re more proactive and plan to seek out a group to join, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. From the left navigation menu, expand the Groups option and click 
the Groups Directory link. 
 
 You’re taken to the Groups Directory page on LinkedIn, as shown in 
Figure 14-2.

2. When you see the Groups Directory page, enter some keywords in the 
text box underneath Search Groups.
 
 In the text box, enter keywords that would describe the group that inter-
ests you. Say for example that I’m looking to join a group that promotes 
or encourages public speaking. I would enter public speaking into the 
text box. 
 
3. Click the Search button to see a list of groups that match your 
keywords. 
 
 Go through the results list, as shown in Figure 14-3, and read the 
descriptions of each group on the list. If you need more information 
about the group, click the Owner’s name to see his profile and send him 
a message about the group.
 
4. When you see a Group that you want to join, click the Title of the 
Group (or the Join This Group link after the group description).
 
 When you click either link, you’re taken to the Group summary page, 
as shown in Figure 14-4. You see the summary of the group, number of 
members (in the top-right corner), and you need to decide whether to 
join the group.

the requirements for membership, your request will either be immedi-
ately approved or sent to the group manager for manual approval.

251
 Chapter 14: Getting Connected with LinkedIn Groups
Searching a Group
After you’ve joined a group, you’ll probably want to see who’s in the group 
and how the group members are connected to you! After all, the point of 
these groups is to stay in touch with like-minded individuals and have them 
be part of your extended network. 
To search a group, follow these steps:
 
1. From the left navigation menu, click the Groups link.
 
 This brings up your My Groups page. 
 
2. Click the View Members link under the logo and name for your group.
 
 This brings up a list of members in the group, sorted by how many 
degrees they are away from you in your LinkedIn network. 
 
3. (Optional) Click the Refine Search Results link and add other search 
criteria to get a more targeted results list.
 
 This brings up an advanced search page, as shown in Figure 14-5. You 
can see that the search is automatically limited to members of your 
group. Now you can add more search requirements such as names, com-
panies, user types, locations, and so on. 
 
4. Click the Search button, and your search is carried out according to 
the refined search criteria you entered.
Case study: CalTech gets connected
Caltech Alumni Association launched an official 
alumni group on LinkedIn in 2006. Out of some 
20,000 contactable alumni, it now has approxi-
mately 2,000 members in the LinkedIn group — 
about 10 percent. Andrew Shaindlin, Executive 
Director of the association, is one of the early 
adopters of using third-party social networking 
sites to help alumni stay connected.
With more than a year of experience running 
the group, Shaindlin noticed some cool things 
that his alumni members were doing with this 
new LinkedIn group, including the following:
  Alumni group members saw higher search 
engine placements for their member’s names 
and more page views for CalTech in general. 
  Graduates were making connections 
between their alumni network members and 
their non-alumni network members when 
they were networking. 
  The CalTech Alumni Web site saw an 
increase of traffic from members click-
ing through from LinkedIn via the LinkedIn 
group Web site URL link. 
  The CalTech Alumni Association has more 
graduates’ e-mail address on file, attributed 
partially to their LinkedIn group.
  Most importantly, there are success stories 
about CalTech alumni finding jobs, employees, 
and investors through their LinkedIn Group.

Creating a Group
When you’re ready to create your own group, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Groups link in the left navigation menu. 
 
 You see the Groups page, with three tabs along the top: My Groups, 
Groups Directory, and Create Groups.
 
2. Click the Create Groups tab. 
 
 This step brings you to the Create a Group page, as shown in Figure 14-6. 
This is where you input all the information about your newly requested 
group.
 
3. Upload the logos for your group.
 
 LinkedIn requires two logos: one sized at 100 x 50 pixels and one sized 
at 60 x 30 pixels. The larger logo is used on the Groups home page, and 
the smaller logo shows up in the group members’ profile pages. Click the 
Browse buttons next to each logo box and, in the Choose File dialog box, 
locate the logo file on your computer so LinkedIn can upload it; then 
click Open. 

253
 Chapter 14: Getting Connected with LinkedIn Groups
 
Figure 14-6: 
Enter your 
new group 
information 
here!
 
 
 “But where do I get a logo?” you might ask. Well, you can design your 
own logo at sites like www.logoyes.com or www.logoworks.com. If a 
logo already exists, like an alumni association, ask one of the adminis-
trators for a high resolution copy of the logo, or save a copy of the logo 
from the group’s personal Web site.
 
 Each logo can be only 100 kilobytes in size, so watch that file size as you 
create your logos.
 
4. Provide your group information, including group name, description, 
type, Web site URL, manager e-mail, and whether you want your 
group visible on your member’s profile pages (refer to Figure 14-7).
 
 You have only 300 characters in your group description, so choose your 
words wisely.
 
 If you’re wondering what to write for your group description, first 
click the Groups Directory tab near the top of the page (before writing 
anything) and read through similar groups in your group type. Then, 
go back to the Create Groups page and enter your description. (If you 
check the Groups Directory while writing your description, you’ll lose 
whatever you’ve typed.) 
 
5. If your group is located in one geographic region, click the appropri-
ate check box. 

254
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
6. Read through the Terms and Conditions and click that check box 
when you have reviewed it. 
 
 At this point, your page should look something like Figure 14-7, where 
your logos and information are uploaded and ready for review. 
 
Figure 14-7: 
Your group 
request is 
ready to be 
submitted!
 
 
7. When you’ve entered all your information, click the Submit Group for 
Review button to send your request to LinkedIn. 
 
 You’re taken back to the My Groups page and your request has been 
submitted. 
 
 You should see your newly created group on your page, with the note 
Pending approval underneath, as shown in Figure 14-8. Allow some 
time for LinkedIn to review your request, and once it is approved, your 
new group is ready for members!

Inviting Members
After you get your confirmation from LinkedIn that your new group has been 
created, your next step is to invite members to be a part of this group! The 
way this is handled with LinkedIn is actually a multi-part process:
 
1. You have to define a list of pre-approved members of your group, which 
you will upload to LinkedIn. You should do this before you send out any 
Invitations.
 
2. You’re allowed to e-mail your prospective members with an Invitation to 
join your new group. LinkedIn provides you with a customized link that 
you can use as your Invitation. 
 
3. When a new member clicks that link, LinkedIn checks to see whether 
that member is on your Pre-Approved list. If so, she automatically 
becomes a member. If not, you (the group manager) will see a member 
request in the Manage section of your group entry, which you will 
have to manually approve so the user can officially join the group. The 
user’s status will show up as Pending on their My Groups page until you 
approve her membership request.

Building your member list
The easiest way to build your list of members is to use a spreadsheet program like 
Microsoft Excel and create something called a Comma Separated Values file (.csv 
file) which is simply a text file of members and their e-mail addresses. You should 
definitely have your member list in front of you before starting this process. 
 
If many of the members are already connected to you in LinkedIn, you can 
simply export your connections to start building your member list. See 
Chapter 6 for more information on how to do this.
When you’re ready to build your list of members, just follow these steps: 
 
1. Open a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. Select 
File➪New from the top Excel menu to create a new blank document.
 
2. In the first row, create these entries, which will be the three column 
headers:
 
• First Name
 
• Last Name
 
• E-mail Address
 
3. Starting in the second row, fill in the members’ names and e-mail 
addresses. 
 
 As you fill in your list, it should begin to look like Figure 14-9.

member list!
 
 
4. Choose File➪Save As. 
 
 The Save As window pops up, as shown in Figure 14-10. 

257
 Chapter 14: Getting Connected with LinkedIn Groups
 
5. Make sure that the Save as Type option is set to CSV (Comma delim-
ited) and click OK when prompted. 
 
Figure 14-10: 
Don’t forget 
to save your 
file as CSV 
(Comma

6. Go to your LinkedIn account and click the Groups link in the left navi-
gation menu to bring up your My Groups page. 
 
7. From the My Groups page, click the Manage link underneath the name 
of your group. 
 
 This brings up the Current Members page of your group (as part of your 
My Groups tab), as shown in Figure 14-11. At first, you’re the only cur-
rent member of this new group. 
 
8. Click the Invite Members link from the Manage This Group pane on 
the right. 
 
 This brings up the Invite Members page, as shown in Figure 14-12. For 
right now, you’re interested in the bottom part of the page, where you 
can upload your newly created list. 
 
9. Click the Browse button to find the CSV file on your computer. 
 
10. After you’ve indicated the list of members, click the Upload File 
button to upload the list of members into your group.
 
 The next page indicates whether the file was uploaded correctly. You 
should see your member list uploaded correctly, as shown in Figure 
14-13. Here, you have two options. 
 
• Upload and Replace: If you want to replace an existing list of members 
with the list you are uploading, click the Upload and Replace button. 
 
• Upload and Add: If you want to add a list of members to a pre-exist-
ing list, click the Upload and Add button. 
 
 If you’re doing this for the first time, just click Upload and Add.

 You’re done! Your new members will appear on the Pre-Approved list 
for this group.
 
 You can always click the Invite Members link and use the form to manu-
ally add additional names at any time. 
 
If the e-mail address of a member’s LinkedIn profile is different from the e-mail 
address you put in the Pre-Approved list, this member won’t be automatically 
approved when he clicks the link. You have to manually approve him by click-
ing the Requests to Join link from the Groups page.
You might have noticed in Step 7, when you clicked the Invite Members link, 
the top of the page had a special Web URL. This is the exact Web address 
URL link that you need to e-mail to your prospective members. When they 
click it, they are added to the group! This will be useful in the next section, 
“Crafting your Invitation e-mail.”
Crafting your Invitation e-mail
LinkedIn doesn’t send group Invitations, because the folks at LinkedIn feel 
that the Invitations should come from the group owner — namely you! 
Therefore, here are some do’s and don’ts to keep in mind as you craft the 
Invitation:

260
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Do relate the purpose and benefits of the group. People are busy and 
need to understand why they should join this group. Explain the benefits 
of being connected to other people and what you hope to accomplish 
with this group. Remember, you’re sending this to LinkedIn members, so 
don’t worry about explaining LinkedIn — just explain your group. 
 
 Do make it easy to join. Make that link easy to find by placing it on its 
own line, so it’s visible and ready to click. Don’t bury the link within a 
paragraph; make sure it stands out. Apply bold or italics the link if you 
want to give it additional attention. 
 
 Don’t go on forever. One to two paragraphs is the maximum this 
Invitation should be. Introduce yourself, introduce the group name, give 
people the benefits of joining, present the link, encourage them to join, 
and sign off. No one will read a long diatribe or laundry list of reasons to 
join. Use bullet points and short sentences whenever possible. 
 
 Don’t put other offers in the e-mail. Some people use this as an oppor-
tunity not only to encourage one group Invitation, but perhaps a second 
group Invitation, or another link to the group’s non-LinkedIn Web site. 
The moment you start presenting multiple options for people, you lose 
their attention and they won’t sign up. 
You can use any e-mail program to create an Invitation to your group, and 
your Invitation can look as simple as this:
Hello,
You are hereby invited to join the new UC Irvine GSM/Merage Alumni 
Group on LinkedIn. Joining this group will allow you to find and contact 
other alumni, so you can stay in touch, gain referrals, and view other 
alumnis’ LinkedIn profiles.
Here is the link to join:
www.linkedin.com/e/gis/12345/67890ABCDEFG (link from Invite Members 
screen)
Hope to see you in the group!
—Joel Elad, Class of 2002
After you’ve sent out the Invitations, as members respond they’re moved 
from the Pre-Approved list to the Current list of your group, and the small 
group logo appears on their profiles. 
Approving members to your group
As more and more people find out about your new LinkedIn group, and 
as members start joining, you may find that some of the people who have 
clicked the link to join aren’t on your pre-approved list. Perhaps they are 

261
 Chapter 14: Getting Connected with LinkedIn Groups
people you didn’t realize were on LinkedIn, perhaps you didn’t realize they 
were valid group members, or perhaps they clicked the wrong link and/or 
they don’t belong in your group. 
Regardless of the situation, you need to go into LinkedIn and either approve 
or reject people’s membership requests so they can be members (or non-
members) of your LinkedIn group. When you need to do that, just follow 
these steps: 
 
1. From the left navigation menu, click the Groups link to bring up your 
list of My Groups. 
 
 You see the My Groups page.
 
2. Scroll down until you see the name and logo of the group you are 
maintaining, as shown in Figure 14-14.
 
Figure 14-14: 
You can 
manage 
your 
LinkedIn 
group mem-
bership. 
 
 
3. Click the Manage link below the name of your group to bring up the 
Current Members page. From the right pane, click the link Requests to 
Join. 
 
 This step brings up the list of people who are waiting to be approved for 
your group, like in Figure 14-15. 
 
4. To accept people, first select the check box next to each person you 
want to approve to join your LinkedIn group. Then click the Approve 
button. 
 
 You can approve people individually or all at once if you want. You can 
always select the person’s name on the list to read his LinkedIn profile 
and decide whether he belongs in the group or send him a message 
through his profile.

5. To refuse membership, first select the check box next to each person 
you want to decline membership to the group, and then click the 
Decline button. 
Similar to the approval process, you can decline people one at a time, or all 
at once. In either case (approval or decline) the user’s name disappears from 
the Request to Join page.

Your Business
In This Chapter
 Exploring marketing strategies for yourself and your business

 Locating marketing partners and doing market research
I
n this final part of the book, you find out how to start applying everything 
the previous parts cover about how to use the site for specific situations 
and needs. After all, every great invention needs to fulfill some sort of pur-
pose, and LinkedIn is no exception. Its value is not just in how it allows you 
to network and build your brand, but also in how you can use LinkedIn to 
handle other tasks easier and more effectively. 
I start with the age-old discipline of marketing. In this chapter, I discuss how 
to go about generating sales and how LinkedIn can affect your entire sales 
cycle. LinkedIn can help you “spread the gospel” of your business mission by 
serving as a vehicle for positive and rich marketing messages about both you 
and your business, whether it’s a startup or a Fortune 500 company. Part of 
the power of LinkedIn comes from involving others in your marketing initia-
tives, so I cover some ways for you to do that as well. 
Marketing Yourself through LinkedIn
When it comes to LinkedIn, you are your biggest advocate. Although your 
network of connections is instrumental in helping you grow, much of 
your marketing happens without your being involved; that is, after you 
create your profile, that and any other LinkedIn activity of yours is read 
and judged by the community at large — on the other members’ own time 
and for their own purposes. Therefore, you want to make sure that you’re 
creating a favorable impression of yourself by marketing the best traits, 
abilities, and features of you and your business. Because of the nature of 
LinkedIn, this marketing occurs continually — 24/7. So, you should look at 

264
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
LinkedIn as something to check and update on a continual basis, like a blog. 
It doesn’t mean you have to spend hours and hours each day, but a little 
bit of time on a consistent basis can go a long way towards a favorable and 
marketable LinkedIn identity. 
The following sections look at the different ways you interact with LinkedIn, 
and what you can do to create the most polished, effective LinkedIn identity 
possible to further your marketing message. 
Optimizing your profile
In Chapter 3, I discuss building your professional profile on LinkedIn, which 
is the centerpiece of your LinkedIn identity and your personal brand. I refer 
to your profile throughout this book, but here, I focus on ways for you to 
update or enhance your profile with the specific goal in mind of marketing 
yourself better or more consistently. As always, not every tip or suggestion 
will work for everyone, and you may have already put some of these into 
action, but it’s always good to revisit your profile to make sure it’s organized 
the way you intended. 
To make sure your profile is delivering the best marketing message for you, 
consider these tips:
 
 Use the Professional headline wisely. Your professional headline is 
what other LinkedIn users see below your name even when they’re not 
looking at your full profile. I’ve seen some users stuff a lot of text into 
this field, so you should have enough space to communicate the most 
important things about yourself. Simply put, if you have one, or even 
two, key phrases you want associated with your name, they should be a 
part of your headline.
 
 A standard headline reads something like, “Software Development 
Manager at XYZ Communications,” but you can write entire sentences 
full of great keywords for your headline. My friend Anderee Berengian’s 
headline reads: “Growth-Stage, Results-Oriented Internet & Digital Media 
Professional, Advisor, and Investor.” Think about how many people 
would want to connect with him!
 
 Make sure you use keyword phrases that match popular keywords for 
you or your business. The first step, as I just mentioned, is to put these 
phrases in your headline. The second step is to make sure these phrases 
are reflected in your Summary, Experiences, and Interests.
 
 Be careful not to overuse your main keyword phrases. The search 
engines call this practice “stuffing,” which refers to trying to stuff as 
many instances of a phrase in hopes of achieving a higher ranking. If the 
search engines detect this, you will actually experience lower ranking 
results.

265
 Chapter 15: Marketing Yourself and Your Business
 
 If you’re available for freelance work, make sure that at least one of 
your current positions is labeled Freelance. Remember, people aren’t 
mind readers (Karnac excluded), so you need to let people know that 
you’re a freelance writer, Web site designer, dog walker, or whatever. If 
you look at Leya Booth’s profile in Figure 15-1, you can see that she’s self-
employed as owner of Genius Office Services, which offers book editing, 
transcription, and tutoring services, along with other specialties. 
 
Figure 15-1: 
Make sure 
a current 
position is 
labeled self-
employed or 
freelance.
 
 
 Use the additional fields in your profile to include any relevant infor-
mation that reinforces your marketing message. For example, if you 
want to be seen as an expert in a given field, include references to any 
articles or books you’ve written, articles you’ve been quoted in, focus 
or advisory groups you belong to, and any speaking engagements or dis-
cussions you’ve participated in.
 
 Make sure your profile links to your Web sites, blogs, and any other 
part of your online identity. Don’t just accept the standard “My 
Company” text; instead, select the option Other: and put your own 
words in the box entitled Website title, such as “Joel Elad’s E-Commerce 
Education Web site.” (See Chapter 3 for more information on linking 
from your profile to other Web sites.)

266
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
For an example of effectively linking your profile to other areas of your online 
presence, take a look at Ben Hanna’s profile, shown in Figure 15-2. His three 
Web site links replace the bland “My Company,” “My Blog,” and “My Website” 
with his own text— Business.com, B2B Search Market Strategy, and My 
Business How-To Guides. Not only does this give more information to some-
one reading his profile, it gives the search engines a better idea of what those 
links represent.

ingful

Marketing yourself to your network
Optimizing your profile in the ways described in the previous section is one 
of the best ways to market yourself effectively using LinkedIn. Another is to 
be alert to how well you’re communicating with your LinkedIn connections. 
Whether it’s automatic (like when you update your profile and LinkedIn auto-
matically notifies your network through a Network Update) or self-generated 
(when you use LinkedIn InMail or Introductions to send a note to someone 
else, which I cover in Chapter 5), this communication becomes your ongoing 
message to the members of your network and keeps you in their minds and 
(you hope!) plans. 

267
 Chapter 15: Marketing Yourself and Your Business
The most effective marketing occurs when people don’t realize you’re mar-
keting to them. After all, the average American sees approximately 4,000 
marketing messages per day. Your goal is to communicate often but not be 
overbearing about it so your message subtly sinks into people’s minds. If you 
do that, people will think you’re GRRRRRR-EAT! (Hmm, why am I hungry for 
cereal?)
So when you’re contemplating how to effectively communicate with your net-
work connections, keep these points in mind: 
 
 Update your profile when appropriate. Updating your profile means 
that you’re sending an update of your newest projects to your network 
so that your connections know whether they might want to consider 
involving you in their own current or future projects. I do not recom-
mend that you update your profile as often as you update a blog, but 
you certainly don’t want to leave your profile untouched for months on 
end, either. Useful times to update your profile include
 
• Getting a new job or promotion
 
• Starting a new freelance or contract job
 
• Launching a new company or venture
 
• Adding a missing piece of your Experiences section, like adding a 
new position, updating the description of an existing job, or clarify-
ing the role of a group or interest on your profile
 
• Taking on new responsibilities or duties in any of your endeavors
 
 Take advantage of the “What are you working on?” feature. When 
you specify your current endeavors, several things happen. Your pro-
file reflects what you enter here, your network connections see what 
you enter here when they read their Network Updates about you (see 
Chapter 9 for more on Network Updates), and over time, you start to 
build your own “micro-blog,” in a sense, because people can follow your 
natural progression. A similar example of this is the micro-blogging ser-
vice called Twitter. As you update your Twitter profile with 240-charac-
ter messages, other people can follow your activities and even subscribe 
to these updates. 
 
 Some people use the status feature to let people know that, “Joel is get-
ting ready for his week-long vacation” or “Joel is finishing up his first 
draft of LinkedIn For Dummies.” Other people use the messages to show 
progression of a certain task, like “Joel is currently interviewing for an 
Executive Assistant position,” then “Joel is narrowing down his choices 
for Executive Assistant to two finalists,” and then “Joel has made an 
offer to his top choice for Executive Assistant.” See Chapter 9 for more 
on how to use this feature. 

268
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Search for, and join, any relevant LinkedIn Groups that can help you reach 
your target audience. It’s a good idea to participate in these groups, but 
whatever you do, don’t immediately download a list of all group members 
and spam them with LinkedIn messages. When you join the group, you’re 
indicating your interest in that group because your profile now carries that 
group logo. Membership in such groups gives you access to like-minded 
people you should be communicating with and adding to your network. 
Spend some time every week or every month checking out LinkedIn Groups 
and networking with group members to grow your network. 
 
 Ask appropriate questions of selected people rather than the whole 
network. When you use LinkedIn Answers (see Chapter 7) to ask a ques-
tion or gain more knowledge about something, rather than blast your 
entire network with your request, send a personalized invitation to only 
those members in your network who seem the most likely to have the 
knowledge you need. 
 
 Don’t ask questions to the same people all the time. Change the focus of 
your questions at regular intervals so that you reach out to more of your 
network over the year. For example, you may ask some questions on soft-
ware development for a few months, then change and focus on project 
management for a while. On the other hand, when you know of a question 
that could interest your entire network, don’t hesitate to let everyone 
know. Do that too often, however, and people will feel annoyed by it.
 
 Participate on a regular and consistent basis. The easiest way to 
ensure a steady stream of contact with as many people as you can 
handle is to dedicate a small but fixed amount of time to interacting 
with the LinkedIn community. Some members spend 15 to 30 minutes 
per day, sending messages to their connections, reading through the 
Questions and Answers pages, or finding one to two new people to add 
to their network. Others spend an hour a week, or as long as it takes to 
create what they’ve set as their set number of recommendations, invite 
their set number of new contacts, or reconnect with their set number of 
existing connections. You just need to establish a routine that works for 
your own schedule. 
Marketing Your Business through 
LinkedIn
Currently, LinkedIn offers you two types of business promotion, one for small 
businesses and another for large ones. For small businesses, owners and 
managers rely on their own profile pages (which, as mentioned earlier, can 
contain links to company and other types of Web sites). For large companies, 
LinkedIn has created Company Profile pages (for free) through an agreement 
with Capital IQ and BusinessWeek that covers 160,000 companies that these 
companies gathered information about and supplied to LinkedIn. 

269
 Chapter 15: Marketing Yourself and Your Business
 
If you have a problem with the content of your Capital IQ/BusinessWeek–
generated Company Profile page, click the Feedback link on the Company 
Profile page. If you’re a verified employee of the company, you can update 
the Company Profile page yourself. If you’re still stuck, send an e-mail to 
linkedinissues@capitaliq.com.
Online marketing tactics using LinkedIn
Marketing your business on LinkedIn involves working through your own 
network, employing both your current list of contacts as well as potential 
contacts in the greater LinkedIn community. Your efforts should also include 
making use of links from your online activities to your LinkedIn profile and 
promoting your business online from your LinkedIn identity. Here are some 
things to keep in mind as you develop your LinkedIn marketing strategy:
 
 Encourage every employee to have a LinkedIn profile and to link to 
each other. Extending your network in this way increases your expo-
sure outside your company. And if anybody in your organization is ner-
vous about preparing her profile, just tell her that even Bill Gates has a 
LinkedIn profile. That should do the trick! (And then buy her a copy of 
this book to get the profile created.)
 
 Make sure your business Web sites and blogs are linked to your LinkedIn 
profile. By offering your Web site visitors a direct view to your LinkedIn 
profile, you’re allowing them to verify you as an employee of the company 
because they can see your experiences and your recommendations from 
other people. They may also realize that they share a bond with you and 
your business that they never would have realized without LinkedIn.
 
 Make sure your LinkedIn profile links back to your business Web site and 
blog. Yes, you want your visitors and potential customers to be able to verify 
who you are, as noted in the previous bullet in this list, but you also want 
them to go back to your Web site and do some business with you! Make sure 
that you, and every employee of your company who’s on LinkedIn, includes a 
link to your business’s Web site and, if there is one, the company blog. 
 
 If you have a search engine expert working for you, that person may 
complain about something called a two-way link, which is a link 
from your LinkedIn profile to your Web site and a link from your Web 
site to your LinkedIn profile. This practice, known as reciprocal linking, 
hurts your search engine ranking. If so, have that person identify which 
of the two links is more important and implement only that links. 
 
 Make sure that your most popular keyword phrases are in your company 
or personal profile. Use sites such as wordtracker.com or goodkey-
words.com to find the hottest keyword phrases in your field. If your business 
is doing any online ad campaigns, make sure those keyword phrases are the 
same as the ones in your profile. Presenting a consistent image to any 
potential customer makes you and your company look more professional. 

270
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Develop relationships with key business partners or media contacts. 
When you search for someone on LinkedIn, you can be very precise 
about who you want to reach. So, for example, if you know that your 
business needs to expand into the smartphone market, you can start 
targeting and reaching out to smartphone companies such as Apple, 
Research In Motion (maker of the Blackberry), and Palm (maker of the 
Treo). If you want to increase your visibility, start reaching out to media 
members who cover your industry. 
Getting a Services Listing through 
a recommendation
Now, you may ask, “What if I am my business?” Anyone who provides a 
professional service, such as consulting or freelance writing (to name just 
a couple), will want to be sure to take advantage of the LinkedIn Service 
Provider directory. This directory consists of categories and subcategories 
that range from computer-related consultants to attorneys, accountants, 
and real estate agents. If you click the drop-down arrow next to the word 
Companies in the top navigation bar and then click the Services Provider 
link, you can see the list of categories along the right side of the screen.
The tricky part about appearing in this directory is that you can’t simply list 
yourself in this directory; instead, LinkedIn requires you to obtain a recom-
mendation from another LinkedIn member. The reason for this requirement 
is simple: LinkedIn wants a directory of only providers that have at least one 
person willing to publicly validate their work.
The moment you receive a recommendation from a LinkedIn member about 
your services, your profile is included in the Service Providers directory. To 
request a recommendation from someone, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to the word Companies in the top 
navigation bar; then select Service Providers.
 
 You should be taken to the Service Providers home page, as shown in 
Figure 15-3. Note the Request a Recommendation link at the top-right 
corner.
 
2. Click the link Request a Recommendation to bring up the recommen-
dation page, which is shown in Figure 15-4.

3. Under Choose a Position, click the arrow for the drop-down list to find 
the position you want someone to recommend you for. 
 
 If you want your Services recommendation to be tied to a specific role, 
pick one of your positions that indicates that service, such as Freelance 
Writer or Website Designer position. If you don’t see an appropriate 
position in your list, click the [Add a Position] link to add a new position 
to your Experience section of your profile. (For more information on 
how to update your profile, see Chapter 3.)
 
4. Click the gray Select Connections button to pick the people you want 
to ask for a recommendation.
 
 A new window opens. 
 
5. Click the check box to add people to your list of requests. When 
you’re done, click the Finished button to close that window and 
return to the Request Recommendations page.
 
6. In the box under “Create Your Message,” write a note that will go out 
to each person you have selected, similar to the example shown in 
Figure 15-5.
 
 Although LinkedIn will fill in this box with canned text, I recommend that 
you change this text to make it sound as though it’s coming from you. 
Make sure the Subject line is appropriate, too, because doing so helps 
your chances of getting your intended requesters to actually open the 
e-mail and respond.

7. Click the Send button.
 
 Your request is sent and your selected connections receive a mes-
sage from LinkedIn, asking them to come to the site and complete a 
Recommendation for you. 
That’s it! If you need information on how to complete a Recommendation for 
someone who requests one from you, for example, check out Chapter 8. 
Finding Marketing Partners 
through LinkedIn
When it comes to marketing on LinkedIn, your strategy will typically involve 
more than just you and your business. Part of the success of marketing 
through LinkedIn is finding the right marketing partners to help you with 
your goals and take you to the next level. After all, you’re connecting with 
like-minded professionals who have skills similar or complementary to yours, 
which helps you and them achieve your goals. In some cases, finding the 
right partner can make a big difference in the growth of your business, as I 
found out by interviewing Kristie Spilios. See the sidebar “No trouble starting 
TrebleMakers (with the help of a LinkedIn contact),” located in this chapter.
Your first order of business is to use the LinkedIn Service Providers direc-
tory to start identifying potential partners. (See Chapter 13 on how to use the 
Service Providers directory.) You can look for service providers that may be 
two or three degrees away from you, or you can target people you want to 
meet at specific companies by seeing who in your network can arrange an 
introduction. Ideas to keep mind during your search include
 
 Pay attention to people’s titles. In the past, you may have told some-
body, “I need to talk to someone who works at advertising sales for 
a major radio network.” Today, with LinkedIn, you can look for an

who you need to know, specifically, and LinkedIn will show you whether 
that person is connected to you by one, two, or three degrees. 
 
 Join the LinkedIn groups that would appeal to your business. One of 
the quickest ways to signal your interest and find like-minded business-
people is to join a LinkedIn group that’s relevant to your industry or 
niche. You can then search group members to find potential partners. 
Also, because your groups are listed on your profile, joining a group 
means that you’ll have a lasting reference on your profile that will let 
people know that you identify with this group.

 Search LinkedIn Answers for people with similar situations as yours. 
You might find someone at a similar company who looked for an SEO 
expert and asked the community for help. The people who respond may 
give you insight on whom to choose and to add to your network. 
Odds are, you won’t have all the answers when it comes to your strategic 
plan, marketing plan, or maybe even your business direction. Thankfully, 
when you’re using LinkedIn, you are definitely not alone. LinkedIn allows you 
to tap the collective knowledge of its community, enabling you to perform-
ing market research on a variety of topics and get real- time answers without 
involving think tanks or putting out thousands of dollars in fees. 
The key is to be honest, transparent, and — as odd as this may sound — 
grateful. You are asking people’s advice and thoughts, so don’t expect them 
to write out a 30-page market analysis for you for free. Share your goals and 
intentions, get people discussing the idea and each other’s comments, and be 
ready to listen. The best research results from the community’s exchange of 
ideas, with a bunch of voices chiming in to validate or discount the theorem 
of the moment. 
 
 Ask targeted questions on LinkedIn Answers and follow up with 
people who left the best answers. As discussed in Chapter 7, LinkedIn 
Answers provides an excellent and free way to tap the knowledge base 
of the community, in an abundance of categories. Although you can post 
a general “Where do we go from here?” question, you can also ask a tar-
geted or focused question concerning one element of your research and 
then gauge the response. Don’t forget to start a dialog with your most 
enthusiastic responders, because they have already demonstrated inter-
est and knowledge. 
 
 Watch your Question thread closely (through the My Q&A tab) and 
provide clarification or responses whenever needed. Some people 
just throw out a question on LinkedIn Answers and then sit back and 
wait for the genius to flow in. More often, however, the discussion that 
ensues on the Answer thread may veer off from your intended topic, or 
the responses completely miss the mark because they don’t interpret 
your question accurately. You can add clarification to the original ques-
tion, or add your own reply in when needed. If nothing else, reply with 
a thank you for a very good answer and encourage others to keep that 
answer in mind. For more details on how to accomplish this, turn to 
Chapter 7 and find the section on clarifying your question. 
 
 After you’ve received at least five to ten responses, I recommend that 
you pick a best answer and some good answers by selecting the appro-
priate check boxes next to each person’s answer. Not only does this 
reward people who gave you a lot of great information, it indicates to 
the community which responses best fit, in case someone finds this 
question in a search later on.

275
 Chapter 15: Marketing Yourself and Your Business
 
 Keep the conversation open and continuous. Try to leave part of your 
question open-ended so that the people answering it can discuss their 
theories and you will have a more natural reason for follow-up with them 
individually. Sometimes, keeping the door open is as easy as ending 
your post with something like “If you think you can help with this situa-
tion, let me know.” 
 
 Set up a LinkedIn Group that speaks to your target audience and your 
company’s (or your) capabilities. For example, to cite my tried-and-
true example, say that you’re trying to reach accountants for financial 
services companies. To get the ball rolling, you could start the Financial 
Services Accountants Group, spread the word to your target audience, 
and stay in touch with that audience via this group whenever you want 
to know more about your target audience.
No trouble starting TrebleMakers (with the help of 
a LinkedIn contact)
Several years ago, Kristie Spilios co-founded a 
company called TrebleMakers, which teaches 
music enrichment classes to young children. 
When she was building her marketing plan 
with her business partner, she and her partner 
realized that an important piece was the

(continued)
Web site and logo design they would be using. 
Given their limited preliminary budget, they 
were completely unable to find anyone who 
would address their needs. And then came sal-
vation. 
“When all hope seemed lost, I received a 
LinkedIn e-mail update that announced the 
connection of one of my contacts with an 
old, mutual friend from our high school days,” 
relates Spilios. “This shared companion had 
just opened a consulting business and was 
enthusiastically eager to work with us despite 
our start-up woes.”
Three months later, TrebleMakers received its 
“spectacular” Web site and “dazzling” logo 
for a reasonable fee that fell within their price 
range. The consultant even included some 
complementary business cards and letterhead 
stationery as appreciation for TrebleMakers’ 
belief in him and his latest endeavor. Today, 
TrebleMakers is thriving and growing, and 
Spilios credits much of that success to having 
an informative Web site and prominent logo, 
saying that “We receive almost as many words 
of praise on our Web site and logo as we do on 
the music classes themselves!”
“Without LinkedIn and its awesome networking, 
my company would most likely still be search-
ing for a cost-efficient marketing solution. But, 
instead of singing the blues, my business part-
ner and I both have happy harmony, all thanks 
to LinkedIn!”

W
hen it comes to “making the sale,” every edge you can gain over the 
competition is important. LinkedIn provides several ways to help 
you to get more competitive, close the sale, and even help deliver the win-
ning solution. There are ways throughout the entire sales cycle that a well-
connected network and detailed profile can help you narrow the gap, identify 
with your potential lead, gain some trust, and make that sale.
In this chapter, I tell you about some of the ways that LinkedIn can help you 
in the area of sales. You find out about prospecting, or generating leads, to 
not only find potential clients but also narrow them down to the decision 
maker — the person who’s in the position to decide to buy your product or 
services. After you’ve identified your target, you can research your prospects 
using LinkedIn and, when you have succeeded in setting up a meeting with 
your prospect, you can use LinkedIn to prepare for that crucial meeting. 
Finally, this chapter covers how LinkedIn can help you deliver the winning 
solution after you have made the sale, and how you can report a positive 
experience with your customer, thereby leading to even more sales!

Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
Mining for Your Clients
It’s a big world out there, and in terms of clients, you need to ask yourself, 
Who are you looking for? Is everyone a potential client, or do you have a 
specific demographic in mind? A specific skill set? Maybe you’ve written the 
greatest plug-in tool for accountants who work in the financial services indus-
try and you want to sell this tool directly to your likely users. With LinkedIn, 
you can conduct a search to find people who match your criteria. After you 
locate those people, it’s up to you to approach them and close the sale, 
which I talk about in “Closing the Deal,” later in this chapter. 
Before you start your search, ask yourself a few questions that can help you 
with generating your leads:
 
 Are you looking for people with a specific title or in a particular 
industry? 
 
 Are you looking for decision makers within a company, or are you seek-
ing a general audience? (That is, are you trying to sell into a company, or 
directly to people?)
 
 Besides your main target industry, can you approach related industries, 
and if so, what are they? 
 
 Does the location of your potential contact matter? Does making the sale 
require an in-person visit (which means that the contact needs to live 
near you or you have to be willing to travel to this person)? 
With your answers to these questions in mind, you’re ready to start search-
ing LinkedIn for your leads. 
Generating leads with Advanced 
People Search
When you’re ready to start looking for leads, I recommend jumping right 
in with the LinkedIn Advanced People Search feature, which allows you to 
search the database consisting of tens of millions of LinkedIn members based 
on the criteria you’ve established for the leads you want to generate. 
To start a search, make sure the drop-down list option People is selected in 
the top-right corner, and click the Advanced Search link next to that drop-
down option. Say, for example, that you need accountants who work in the 
Financial Services industry. To start such a search, you would fill in the Title 
and Industry fields of Advanced People Search, as shown in Figure 16-1, and 
click Search.

279
 Chapter 16: Using LinkedIn to Increase Your Sales
 
Figure 16-1: 
Use 
Advanced 
Search to 
find your 
potential 
clients.
 
When you begin your search of the LinkedIn database, your own network 
can help you identify your best leads (people only two or three degrees away 
from you who you can reach through a first-degree connection introduc-
ing you) if you change the Sort By option, shown at the bottom-right corner 
of Figure 16-1, to Degrees Away from You. (The default option is Keyword 
Relevance, as shown in the figure.) When you see your search results, as 
shown in Figure 16-2, you first see which results are closely connected with 
you via your connections. You can click each person’s name to read his 
or her full LinkedIn profile, see how you are connected to that person, and 
decide whether you’ve got a potential lead. (This method provides much 
more information to you than a simple Google search, which would provide 
only a LinkedIn member’s public profile, instead of their full profile.)
Another way to get different search results is to click the LinkedIn Network 
tab from the search results screen, which appears next to the Your Network 
tab above the search result names. This search generates general leads that 
are neither directly nor indirectly connected to you. Here, you can see the 
lead’s title and company, but not his or her name, as Figure 16-3 shows. You 
can find out some details from reading their LinkedIn profile, but you will 
have to use LinkedIn tools like InMail to communicate with these people to 
pursue the lead.

 Chapter 16: Using LinkedIn to Increase Your Sales
When you are doing general prospecting, surveying the market for that “per-
fect lead” or, at least, a lead in the right direction, try to keep these ideas in 
mind while filling in the appropriate fields for each strategy:
 
 Generalize your search: If you’re looking for your ideal contacts inde-
pendently of the company they work for, focus primarily on the Title 
and Industry fields to find your leads. 
 
 Narrow your search: Use the Keywords field to narrow your results list 
when you need to reach people within a certain niche of an industry 
or job. 
 
 Target specific people: Use either the Company or Keywords field, 
plus the Title field, to help you find specific employees in your target 
companies. 
 
 Refine your search by areas of knowledge: Click on Answers from 
the top navigation bar and look for people who answered questions in 
your target area to see whether you spot a potential contact there. (See 
Chapter 7 for more information on using LinkedIn Answers.)
 
 Help your product sell itself: Search for the customers of your cus-
tomers. Why would you do such a thing? You want to get those people 
excited about your product so that they’ll demand it from your cus-
tomers, of course! This strategy is also known as pull marketing. (See 
Chapter 15 for more information about how to use LinkedIn for market-
ing purposes.)
 
 Reach out through service professionals: Search for consultants who 
are hired by your potential customers by using the Title and Industry 
fields, or by choosing “Consultants/contractors” from the Interested In 
drop-down list. You can ask those consultants for help in reaching your 
potential customers.
Finding the decision maker
Although generating a list of potential leads is a great first step in marketing 
your product, effective salesmanship often comes down to finding that “right 
person” whom you can present with an offer to buy something. This person 
is known as the decision maker (or the final authority, or even just the boss). 
You can talk to as many administrative assistants and receptionists as you’d 
like, but without the exact name or contact info of the person who makes the 
purchasing decisions, your sales effort is stalled.
LinkedIn can help you reach that decision maker in the following ways:

282
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 When you perform an advanced search, include words like Account 
Manager, Director, or Vice President in the Search For field. If your 
results show someone who’s in your extended network, now you have a 
specific name to mention when you call the company. I recommend that 
you approach that person via LinkedIn and your mutual connections 
first, thereby making your first contact with him or her more of a “warm 
call” than a cold one.
 
 Use the LinkedIn Company Profile pages to find out specific informa-
tion about your target company. If you’re trying to reach someone 
within a company you want to target, see whether that person has a 
Company Profile page. To do so, click the drop-down list next to the 
word Companies on the top navigation bar and click the Company 
Search link to search through LinkedIn’s company pages. Say, for exam-
ple, that you need to reach someone within LinkedIn. When you bring up 
LinkedIn’s company profile page, as shown in Figure 16-4, you get some 
specific information right away.
 
Figure 16-4: 
Get specific 
informa-
tion about 
your target 
company 
through its 
profile.
 
 
 You will immediately see who in your network works for this company, 
so you know whom to approach to pass along your request to the deci-
sion maker, or to tell you who that decision maker is. Be sure to scroll 
down the rest of the page, too, to see other useful information, such as 
new hires, recent promotions and changes, and open job listings for the 
company. (See Figure 16-5.)

Figure 16-5:

company’s 
LinkedIn 
Company 
page to find 
out more 
about your 
target 
company.  
 
 Use your existing network to ask for an Introduction or to point you 
in the right direction. Using your network in this manner was basi-
cally the original intent of LinkedIn: You contact someone who works 
at your target company and ask that contact to introduce you to the 
decision maker. The decision maker is much more likely to receive an 
Introduction than a cold call. Your network connection might also serve 
as a recommendation of you to the decision maker, which will carry 
some weight when you try to close the deal. 
 
 Use InMail to contact people close to the decision maker. You may find 
that, in some cases, the decision maker may not be on LinkedIn yet, or 
his or her profile is closed to Introductions and InMail. In such a case, 
you can use LinkedIn to find the closest person to the decision maker 
and ask that person for help, a connection, or information to help you 
reach the next level.
 
 Use InMail to contact the decision maker, if he or she is on LinkedIn. 
You may not have the time or opportunity to get introduced to your deci-
sion maker, and if you’re using InMail to approach the decision maker, 
why not just go for the gusto and make your introduction directly? This 
is a faster option than waiting or asking for an Introduction, but there 
is the chance the decision maker will ignore your message. You have to 
decide what’s best for your situation.

Closing the Deal
Establishing a connection to the right person (the one who makes the pur-
chasing decisions) is half the battle of getting your product sold. However, 
you still have to convince the person and close the deal, of course. In this 
section, I give you some pointers on how to put LinkedIn to work for you for 
the final phase of a sales effort: completing it successfully!
The key to getting the most out of LinkedIn for closing the deal is knowing 
that LinkedIn has more than just names — it has information in the form of 
detailed profiles of its tens of millions of users, and in the form of knowledge 
sharing through LinkedIn Answers, associations made through LinkedIn 
Groups, and corporate information through LinkedIn Company Profiles. 
Researching prospects
When you have identified your prospects, spend some time familiarizing 
yourself with them before you contact them. Gleaning some insight about 
your potential buyers can go a long way toward getting the person to 
respond, taking the time to listen to your pitch, and buying your product. 
Following are some tips concerning specific ways to research your prospec-
tive clients:
 
 Read the prospect’s full profile to discover all you can about his 
or her interests, likes, dislikes, and so on. You can do far more than 
simply scan a person’s profile looking for past jobs and maybe their 
education to see whether they share an alma mater with you. A person’s 
LinkedIn profile can be or lead to a gold mine of information about that 
person. For instance, people may include links to their own Web sites, 
blogs, or company Web sites. Follow those links, especially to blogs or 
personal Web sites, and see what you can find out. In the prospect’s 
profile, look over the Interests section and the Additional Information 
section. And don’t forget the Contact Settings section — here’s where 
you can find out under what circumstances this person wants to be con-
tacted. Be sure to respect those wishes.
 
 Read your prospect’s recommendations for other people. You can 
gain a lot of insight by seeing what qualities a person likes to praise in 
other people, especially if your prospect has left multiple recommenda-
tions. In this way, you also gain insight into the people they trust, so 
check those people who received a recommendation to see whether 
you have a connection to any of them. If so, ask that person first for an 
Introduction to your prospect. 

285
 Chapter 16: Using LinkedIn to Increase Your Sales
 
 Read any questions or answers your prospect wrote for LinkedIn 
Answers. If you pull up someone’s profile, look for a tab entitled Q&A 
(shown in Figure 16-6) and click that tab. The page that opens contains 
all the questions and answers this person has contributed to LinkedIn. 
When you read these contributions, you might gain some insight into 
this person’s preferences and “hot button issues” — what motivates or 
annoys him or her.

pect has

Preparing for the client meeting
Say that your initial conversations with your prospects have gone well and 
you have been granted a meeting with a potential client to make your pitch. 
Whereas you may have already used LinkedIn to gain more information about 
the specific person, you can now turn to discovering details about the spe-
cific industry, the company, and the company’s potential response to your 
business pitch. Here are ways to go about gathering information about the 
company: 

286
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Try to get an informational interview with someone at the target 
company, preferably with someone you know. Check your LinkedIn 
network to see whether you have a first- or second-degree contact at 
the company you’re planning to pitch to. Ask that person to spend some 
time with you for the purpose of gathering information about the com-
pany, and try to get some insights into company priorities and culture. 
Also see what you can learn about the company’s top motivation in pur-
chasing decisions — what priorities or issues the company considers 
before buying something from a vendor. 
 
 Visit the LinkedIn Company Profile page to review all the recent com-
pany activities. As mentioned earlier in this chapter in the “Finding the 
decision maker” section, when you look at the Company Profile page, 
you see sections such as Recent Updates and Changes. Peruse these sec-
tions before your meeting with your potential buyer to find out who has 
been promoted or hired, the key statistics of that company, open job 
listings at the company, and even the most popular profiles of employ-
ees at that company. By doing so, you’ll have more background informa-
tion and therefore more confidence; also, this type of knowledge helps 
you identify interests or commonalities to enhance your sense of con-
nection with your buyer (and his or hers with you).
 
 Use LinkedIn Answers to get advice from the community at large or 
your network. Search LinkedIn Answers to see whether other people 
have already asked questions about your target company, or to find out 
how to approach companies in your industry. If you don’t find anything 
directly related to what you’re searching for, you can pose a question 
yourself and see what recommendations you get from other LinkedIn 
members. 
When all else fails, ask for help!
Michael Goodman is a sales professional from 
Phoenix, Arizona, with more than 30 years of 
sales experience. But even he admits that with 
all the new technologies out there, he was a bit 
lost when trying to figure out exactly how to use 
LinkedIn and other Web 2.0 technologies to help 
him make that next sale. So, he went to LinkedIn 
Answers and posed the following question:
“With all the social media available, including 
LinkedIn, blogs, Twitter, Plaxo, Second Life, et al., 
what is the best way to utilize all this stuff, stay 
ahead of the techno-bleeding edge, and really 
just find another customer to tell my story to?
I can’t keep up with all the social media, Web 
2.0 marketing movement. Really, all I want to do 
is find the next customer. I am hoping someone 
has figured out the magical answer to taking 
advantage of technology and simply finding 
new people interested in what I have to offer. 
Anyone?”
Goodman received more than 25 responses, 
some of which were detailed, multiparagraph 
essays that helped point him in the right direc-
tion on how to use LinkedIn. The answers 
included links to articles about using LinkedIn 
and references to LinkedIn experts who could 
fully answer his question. 

287
 Chapter 16: Using LinkedIn to Increase Your Sales
 
All these efforts are meant only to prepare you and get you closer to your 
prospect or target company so that you can make your pitch. Obviously, to 
complete the sale, you still need to have a compelling product, pitch, and offer 
for this company. Have all of that ready before you approach your prospect. 
Using LinkedIn to Help 
You Complete the Sale
At this stage you have, to borrow a famous phrase, “gotten to yes,” meaning 
that you’ve contacted your prospect and he or she has agreed to buy your 
product or service. Congratulations! You’ve made the sale, and now it’s time 
to deliver. Your membership in LinkedIn can continue to provide value by 
giving you some resources to help you deliver what you promised and ensure 
future sales success. 
Getting help to deliver the solution
After you’ve made the sale, go back to your company with the contract in 
hand and determine the resources and personnel necessary to deliver on 
your contract. In some cases, you may not have everything you need to 
deliver the order. As it can in earlier stages of the sales process, LinkedIn can 
assist you in this stage as well. Here are some of those ways: 
 
 Find partners to create the winning team. You’ve done the hard part: 
You’ve gotten the contract. The customer trusts you to deliver on that 
contract, so it’s your job to build the winning team, and your company 
may not employ full-time all the people you need or you may have 
agreed to additional items to make the sale that require something 
where your business has to speed up development. In such a case, you 
can use your LinkedIn connections to find people who have the missing 
skill sets you need. (See Chapter 11 for tips on finding an employee.) 
You can also perform an Advanced People Search or Service Providers 
search for a consultant or part-time employee who has the skills you 
need to build your products or consult on your service offering. 
 
 Get some direction from the LinkedIn community. You can create a 
question in LinkedIn Answers that polls your network and the greater 
LinkedIn community in the problem area you’ve been hired to solve. 
Get an idea of how other people would tackle this problem, and use the 
answers to identify potential partners or contacts you can use to deliver 
your solution. For example, polling the community about a part of your 
service offering (a part that isn’t client-specific) may result in a LinkedIn 
member providing a new way of approaching the problem. 

288
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Search LinkedIn Answers for past responses that can help you. Odds 
are, the solution you were hired to deliver is not the very first time since 
the world began that someone had to solve that problem. Therefore, 
you should try your luck and search through past answers in LinkedIn 
Answers; you’re likely to get lots of ideas by seeing how other people 
handled similar situations. 
 
 Hire the skills you need. If you can’t find a part-time person or tap the 
skills you’re seeking from someone in your LinkedIn network, it’s time to 
post a job listing on LinkedIn Jobs. See Chapter 11 for the steps on how 
to post a job listing. 
Reporting a positive sale
Reporting the completion of a sale is my favorite part of the business sales 
process. You’ve made the sale, developed the solution, and delivered it to 
the customer. At this point, many people think, “Whew, I’m done. Nothing to 
do now but enjoy the happy hour!” This is a common and natural response, 
but as a member of the LinkedIn world, your job isn’t really done. You want 
to demonstrate your growth (and your company’s growth) that resulted from 
handling this project to encourage future contracts to come your way. Here 
are some actions to consider after you’ve completed the sale and delivered 
the solution:
 
 Invite your customer to your network. You’ve worked hard to earn this 
customer’s trust and to meet (or exceed) the customer’s expectations 
by completing the sale. As a result, you should feel comfortable enough 
to send that person an Invitation to join your network. Doing so could 
keep you in contact with this customer for future opportunities. Studies 
have shown that it’s six times cheaper to sell to an existing customer 
than to acquire a new customer. 
 
 Leave your customer a recommendation. After you’ve added a cus-
tomer to your network, post a recommendation for him or her on the 
system if you feel it’s deserved. Doing so gives your customer a sense of 
“reward” for being a positive contributor, but more important, it informs 
the community that you did a project for this person, which can help 
you in the future. Also, the customer may reciprocate by leaving you a 
recommendation, which strengthens your profile and makes you more 
appealing to future prospects. 
 
 Stay in touch with your customer. You can keep track of your custom-
er’s activities by monitoring your Network Updates (if he or she is a part 
of your network). Routinely keep in touch about the solution you deliv-
ered, perhaps to open the conversation for selling additional products 
or services or maintenance contract work. 

289
 Chapter 16: Using LinkedIn to Increase Your Sales
 
 Update your profile with the skills you acquired or demonstrated 
through this sale. To be ready for future prospects who search the 
LinkedIn database, it’s important to have the right keywords and skill 
sets on your profile so that these prospects can identify you as someone 
who can provide a similar solution. If you are a consultant or freelance 
worker, you can add the project you just completed as experience on 
your profile as well. (See Chapter 3 on how to update your profile.) 
 
 Tap the customer’s network by asking him or her for referrals. After 
you’ve connected with your customer, keep an eye on his or her net-
work. If you think you see a future prospect, consider asking your 
customer for an Introduction or a Recommendation. Usually, if you pro-
vided a quality solution, the customer will readily oblige your request.

hen you put bunches of Internet-savvy, knowledgeable profession-
als who like to network on a growing social networking site like 
LinkedIn, you’re bound to have a community of people who are involved 
and interested in Venture Capital (VC), where specific firms provide millions 
(or tens of millions) of dollars in funding as well as support and board mem-
bers for emerging companies who want to grow, Or you might run across 
professionals involved in angel funding, where wealthy investors invest up 
to a few million dollars of their own money in exchange for ownership per-
centages of emerging companies. You could say that LinkedIn has VC at its 
roots. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman is an angel investor who has invested 
in over 60 companies besides LinkedIn, including such famous companies as 
Facebook, Digg, Flickr, Technorati, Tagged, and Ning. 
LinkedIn has become an important tool for everyone involved in the VC or 
angel funding industry, from the casual observer to the hyper-extended deal-
maker, for many reasons: 
 
 LinkedIn can help entrepreneurs figure out how to connect with a 
Venture Capital firm.
 
 Entrepreneurs can use LinkedIn to build up their management team 
before a proposal is made.

In this chapter, I talk about how you can benefit from using LinkedIn when it 
comes to Venture Capital or angel funding, regardless of your role or position 
in the process. I cover different cases and stories on how entrepreneurs have 
benefited from LinkedIn, as well as how VC firms or angel networks have 
used LinkedIn to find, evaluate, or advance their deals. 
Finding Potential Investors
So, you have a great idea for a company, you want to be the next great thing 
in your industry, and all you need is a blank check to make your dreams 
come true, right? Although LinkedIn can’t guarantee that you’ll find the right 
funding partner, get the money you need, and build your business with a 
great return on investment, the site can help you improve your chances of 
success when dealing with the funding and growth of your business. 
No matter what stage your business is in, whether you just thought of a new 
business idea or invention, you’re building a prototype, you earned your 
first dollar of revenue, or you just hit $1 million in sales, LinkedIn can be an 
invaluable resource for reaching the next step and beyond. The following sec-
tions take a look at some of the ways LinkedIn can assist you in the quest for 
an investor. 
Asking questions and getting 
LinkedIn Answers
Although you may be an expert in your field, you could probably use some 
good advice from existing venture capitalists, angel investors, or successful 
entrepreneurs when it comes to obtaining financing. Thankfully, LinkedIn 
Answers allows you to tap a vast network of knowledgeable folk who are 
experts in that field and gladly give general and specific tips. (See Chapter 7 
for more information about how to use LinkedIn Answers.) While LinkedIn 
Answers has a special category for Startups and Small Businesses, I focus on 
the areas of Venture Capital and angel funding here. If you are not ready for 
that big investment, definitely check out the Startups and Small Business 
category for advice. 

293
 Chapter 17: Venture Capital and Angel Funding
When you’re ready to use LinkedIn Answers to get answers to your specific 
questions regarding Venture Capital or angel funding, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Answers link from the top navigation bar to go to LinkedIn 
Answers. Then, click the link for Finance and Accounting, and find a 
subsection called Financing. 
 
2. Select Financing, which expands the view to reveal the Venture 
Capital and Private Equity category. 
 
 When you go to that category, as shown in Figure 17-1, you see a tar-
geted list of questions for this area.
 
Figure 17-1: 
See what 
questions 
and an-
swers 
Linked-
In has for 
VC and 
equity.
 
You can pose a question from a very general perspective or target a highly 
specific topic. Some of the questions people have asked include
 
 What’s the difference between a venture capitalist and an angel investor?
 
 What are some good venture capitalist Web sites?
 
 Who should I go to for non-traditional funding of a startup?
 
 Who are the Venture Capitalists who invest in scalable open source 
ventures?

294
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 What is the best way to seek interim funding during a period of heavy 
VC negotiations?
 
 How do VCs view venture debt prior to a Series A and post angel 
rounds?
LinkedIn members have used the Answers section to get critiques or reviews 
of their executive summaries, directly ask for a VC or angel investor to con-
sider their venture, or ask other entrepreneurs how their experience was 
with a particular VC or angel investor. Most questions, pleas for help, and 
advice solicitation have received multiple responses, from the one- or two-
sentence reply to the pages-long exposition of precise advice and list of 
accompanying Web sites or contact information. 
If you’re thinking of using LinkedIn Answers, here are some of the best ways 
to do so:
 
 Before you post, search the database. Believe it or not, you may not be 
the first person with your particular question to approach the LinkedIn 
community. Take the time to search LinkedIn Answers to see whether 
someone has asked your question or a variation of it. If you find your 
question, look over the answers given and see whether you get the infor-
mation you needed. If the answers aren’t specific enough, rewrite the 
question in your own words and post it yourself. 
 
 Get the information you’re missing. If you’re writing your business plan 
to get funding and you need some more information to supplement one 
of your sections, ask the LinkedIn community for the facts. Perhaps you 
need to know the size of a potential customer market or the top Web 
sites used by consumers to perform price comparison searches. 
 
 When asking for advice, be as specific as possible. Your question can 
gauge people’s experiences and ask for advice, instead of a fact or figure. 
When asking for advice, though, help your audience by being as specific 
with your request as possible. Asking for help is one thing, but asking 
for three ways to strengthen your proposal will probably generate more 
replies. If you’re in the middle of a situation, spell out the scenario, 
terms and all, as much as you are legally allowed to do. 
Build your dream team
When you’re looking for funding, of any amount, one of the top things that 
any investor will want to see is your management team. No matter how 
great your idea is, the execution of that idea will determine your success. 
Investors see one way to mitigate the risk of their investment by reward-
ing strong management teams that have the skill to weather unexpected 
turns. If your management team is lacking in at least one key area, consider 
LinkedIn as a source to find that missing person. 

295
 Chapter 17: Venture Capital and Angel Funding
Here are some things to keep in mind when doing a search on LinkedIn for 
your next team member: 
 
 Experience is key. Although desire, motivation, and interest are impor-
tant, the way to improve your chances of getting funding is to have 
experienced personnel. This means that, when searching for potential 
candidates, you should study each person’s profile to gauge her docu-
mented experience at past positions first; then see whether her interests 
match your company’s interests. 
 
 Pick complements, not carbon copies. It’s very tempting for an entre-
preneur to seek out like-minded individuals with similar backgrounds to 
build a business. However, companies with the strongest growth had a 
diverse management team that could handle different situations because 
the team’s skills complemented each other. Put your business needs 
ahead of your personal preference. Look for LinkedIn members whose 
profiles indicate strengths that aren’t yet represented in your startup.
 
 Gauge the strength of the candidate’s network. Any time you look to 
add someone to your organization, you should be asking what value 
the person could bring through his existing network. (After all, who you 
know can make the difference.) When you connect with someone, see 
who’s a part of his network, if possible. See what groups and affiliations, 
Web sites, and Q&A are on the candidate’s profile, because that indi-
cates his overall reach into the greater network. 
Putting it all together
Suppose that you’ve got your business plan, management team, market anal-
ysis, prototype or working model, and you’ve built up a customer set. You’ve 
done some research and are ready to start shopping around and looking 
for investment. You’ve perfected your 30-second elevator pitch so you can 
quickly and accurately describe your business to anyone who’s interested, 
and you can quote the facts and figures you need for any presentation. It’s 
time to seek out a funding partner. 
Although this is not the exhaustive list of what you can do, here are some 
tips that can help you find that partner using LinkedIn: 
 
 Gather leads. Use LinkedIn Answers to post a question to either your 
network or the general community about the best firms or investors to 
consider. (You can find out more about LinkedIn Answers in Chapter 7.)
 
 Do research on your leads. Look up potential investors on LinkedIn and 
read their profiles. See what interests they have, what group affiliations 
they maintain, and what information they share or gather using LinkedIn 
Answers. Follow through on any Web sites, blogs, or profiles they link 
to from their profiles. See what you have in common or which benefit of 
your company might interest them the most. 

296
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Work your network and get them working. Do advanced searches to 
see how your network can connect you with the right person. Maybe 
someone in your network knows a VC or someone at the same firm as 
a VC or angel investor. Perhaps someone in one of your groups has the 
right connection in one of her other groups. Let your network know 
what you’re looking for and ask, respectfully, for help, advice, or a push 
in the right direction. 
 
 Get introduced or reach out yourself. If you have a second- or third-
degree connection to a potential investor, use LinkedIn Introductions to 
ask your contacts to introduce you. If you have no direct connections, 
consider using InMail to make your own Introduction. (Chapter 5 has 
more on Introductions and InMail.)
 
 Do your homework before any meeting. Use LinkedIn to prepare 
before you meet any potential investor. Study her profile and check the 
LinkedIn Company Profiles for information about her company. If she’s 
in your extended network, ask your connections (who know her) for 
advice and information on your potential investor. See what companies 
they have invested in and research those companies as well. 
Finding Potential Investments
Maybe someone in your VC firm needs to connect with someone in a particu-
lar industry, or perhaps your organization wants to invest in an emerging 
market or new technology. LinkedIn is a great place for you as a potential 
investor to look for your next investment.
It’s all in the network
One of the benefits of a good investor is the network he brings with him to 
the investment. Though some VCs recommend their own executive and/
or board structure to their investments, other investors simply offer advice 
as to any new hires or support personnel a new company may need in its 
growth phase. Sometimes, the right investor is someone who knows a new 
company’s customer base well and can help this new company land a key 
account. This is all possible through a strong network. Therefore, LinkedIn is 
one of the best ways an investor can grow and strengthen his network. Here 
are some ways LinkedIn can help: 
 
 Monitor your Network Updates. Your network is always working, and 
this point is clearly demonstrated in your Network Updates. Spend some 
time every day or week to look through your Network Updates to see 
which contacts of yours have moved companies, started new projects, 
or participated in questions you may find relevant. (See Chapter 9 for 
more information on Network Updates.)

297
 Chapter 17: Venture Capital and Angel Funding
 
 Monitor LinkedIn Answers. See what questions people are asking in 
your particular industry, and what answers are being posted by other 
people. Pay attention to question categories like Starting Up, Venture 
Capital and Private Equity, and Business Plans. (Chapter 7 has much 
more on LinkedIn Answers, in case you’re dying of curiosity.) 
 
 Identify thought leaders. As you watch your network, LinkedIn Answers, 
and any relevant LinkedIn Groups, pay attention if certain names keep 
popping up over and over again. These people could be thought leaders 
in your intended industry, people that everyone respects as the author-
ity in their given subject matter, and they are worth connecting to in 
order to stay ahead and scope out the best opportunities. Reach out 
to these parties through Introductions or InMail (see Chapter 5) to see 
whether you can create a meaningful connection now and in the future. 
 
 Strengthen your network. Build good contacts in your field through 
regular networking, and avenues like LinkedIn Answers. Identify people 
in your network who are a part of your desired industry and expand into 
their networks by getting to know their connections. 
Do your due diligence
As new proposals for investments come across your way, or you meet an 
entrepreneur in one of your industries who could come to you later with an 
investment proposal, you have to evaluate these proposals and decide how 
to proceed. Here are some ways that LinkedIn can help you filter all this 
incoming information: 
 
 Evaluate your entrepreneurs. When you’re evaluating a proposal, do 
some research by seeing whether the requester has a LinkedIn profile. 
Compare notes between his business plan and his actual profile. See 
how he contributes to LinkedIn through Q&A. Evaluate the entire man-
agement team.
 
 Ask for endorsements. If you’re evaluating a proposal or contemplat-
ing adding someone to your network, see who in your network knows 
this person (or company). If you find a connection, ask your connection 
whether she would endorse or recommend this person. 
 
 Get a sense for your intended market. Ask questions about the 
intended market on LinkedIn Answers. Search previous questions to see 
whether the requesting company has been mentioned or profiled. If so, 
take a close look at the information.

In This Chapter
 Using other types of services with LinkedIn
 Creating a focus group to gain knowledge and expand your opportunities
 Using LinkedIn to smooth the way when relocating
 Finding ways to meet LinkedIn members in person
 Discovering the newest uses of LinkedIn
W
hen you think of business networking site such as LinkedIn, the most 
obvious applications of them spring to mind: finding a job, finding an 
employee, getting to meet new people, building a new business, getting fund-
ing and partners for that new business, and so on. But LinkedIn has acquired 
even more uses than the obvious ones. The power of the Internet and tens of 
millions of LinkedIn members has encouraged people to use this large com-
munity to accomplish other goals, both close to home and reaching around 
the world. 
In this chapter, I give you a look at the some of the “creative” uses that 
people have found on LinkedIn. Some people use LinkedIn in combination 
with other services, such as Google News Alerts. Other people use LinkedIn 
as a gathering place to find recruits to help mold a new venture. Yet others 
have been using LinkedIn to meet each other in person! I describe these 
endeavors as well as provide several case studies with some points to keep 
in mind if you feel like doing something similar.

Mashing LinkedIn with Other Services
One of the hotter trends on the Internet in recent years has been the cre-
ation of mashups. No, I’m not talking potatoes here. A mashup is created 
when somebody takes data from more than one application and puts that 
data together into one new and useful application. For example, say that 
you combined real estate sales data from a database application with the 
Google Maps application, enabling a search result of the real estate data to 
be mapped onto a satellite image on Google. The satellite image represents a 
mash-up because it’s a new, distinct service that neither application provided 
on its own. 
Something similar to the concept of mashups occurs with creative uses of 
LinkedIn. As LinkedIn continues to evolve and its members use more and 
more of LinkedIn’s functionality, new uses for LinkedIn continue to emerge, 
especially as part of a user’s Internet exploits. The following sections 
describe a few smattering of these mashups.
LinkedIn and Google News Alerts
LinkedIn + Google News Alerts = Better-informed communication
I got this tip from Liz Ryan, a workplace expert, author, and speaker, as one 
of her top ten ways of using LinkedIn. It has to do with using both sites as a 
business tool when you’re trying to reach out to an important potential busi-
ness contact who you do not know. It works like this: 
 
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to People in the top navigation bar 
and then click the Advanced People Search link. 
 
2. Fill in the appropriate fields to search for the name of a person at a 
company who is relevant to your situation, and with whom you would 
like to connect. 
 
3. Armed with the name that turned up in the results, set up a Google 
News Alert with the person’s name and the company name so that 
Google will notify you when that person is quoted or in the news.
 
 When you receive a notice from Google News Alerts, you will have a 
much better idea of what the person is working on, as well as his or 
her impact at the company. This knowledge gives you an icebreaker 
by which to strike up a conversation. Rather than send a random con-
nection request, you can reference the person’s speech at the last XYZ 
Summit or agree with his or her last blog post. 
 
 Don’t overuse all this information you get when you contact the person, 
or, as Liz warns, he or she may think you’re a business stalker.

 Chapter 18: Miscellaneous Creative Uses of LinkedIn
LinkedIn Answers and RSS feeds
LinkedIn Answers + RSS feeds = Searchable targeted information
Millions of people are asking, answering, and reading information through 
LinkedIn Answers, and sometimes you may want one thread containing 
every mention of a certain company, person, or concept, instead of having to 
search through Answers all the time. Well, now you can subscribe to a live 
RSS feed and get automatic updates when someone asks or answers a ques-
tion around a given keyword or category. To benefit from this feature, just do 
the following:
 
1. Go to Edgehunt’s mashup site at www.edgehunt.com/mashup/linke-
din/answers and look over the RSS feeds offered. (See Figure 18-1.)
 
 Imagine if you were able to subscribe to a file that contained only the 
newest updates to a Web page, instead of seeing every version of the 
Web page without knowing what was changed. An RSS feed is simply a 
file that only contains the changes that have made to a file, like a Web 
page. Think of it as getting a stream of updates instead of hearing every 
version of the same story.

2. Subscribe to the feed(s) that most interest you.
 
 Click the RSS Feed button next to the feed file that most interests you. 
You would then see a page where you are asked to pick the feed reader 
you want to use, which is basically the software program that will 
receive your RSS feed file and display it to you so you can read it. 
 
3. Set up a news reader to handle the RSS feed(s) so that you can read all 
this information as it gets fed to you.
 
 A popular RSS reader is Google Reader, which you can set up by going to 
http://reader.google.com and following the instructions there.
 
 If you just want an RSS feed of any Answers category, you can now 
use LinkedIn’s RSS feeds for each category. When you’re looking at a 
LinkedIn Answers category, click the orange RSS icon to pull up a menu 
of links to add that category’s RSS feed to your feed reader. 
LinkedIn and the Xobni e-mail plug-in
LinkedIn + Xobni e-mail plug-in = More precise sender information
If you use Microsoft Outlook for your e-mail and you’re constantly being del-
uged with e-mail from people you might or might not remember well, Xobni 
may be the tool for you. Xobni is an Outlook plug-in tool that gives you a 
window of summary information for each sender of an e-mail you receive. 
Say that you got an e-mail from Adam Smith, but you can’t remember exactly 
what Adam does, when and how often Adam e-mails you, and so on. With 
Xobni, the plug-in window shows you who Adam is and how you interact with 
him. Figure 18-2 shows an example of how Xobni displays information.
Xobni has now integrated LinkedIn information into their plug-in window, so 
now when someone’s summary window is displayed, Xobni will display that 
person’s employer, job title, and profile photo, as well as offer a link directly 
to the person’s complete profile on LinkedIn. If you’d like to add this func-
tionality to your Microsoft Outlook program, just follow these steps:
 
1. Go to Xobni’s site at www.xobni.com/download and download its 
newest plug-in application setup file. 
 
 The download window should start up automatically when you go to the 
site’s download page, shown in Figure 18-3.
 
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the set-up wizard that opens to 
install Xobni on your system.
 
 The next time you run Microsoft Outlook, you should see the Xobni 
plug-in on the right side of your Outlook window.

Building Your Focus Group
In other chapters, I’ve told you about the potential for finding qualified part-
ners and customers using LinkedIn, and how LinkedIn Answers can help you 
perform market research and gauge reactions to a new product. Here I want 
to take these ideas one step further and discuss how LinkedIn can help you 
build a focus group for your new or next project. 
Who’s ready to play DISC?
Cynthia (Cindy) Beale heard about LinkedIn 
the way most people do: She got an invitation 
from an old contact — a former high school 
classmate, in her case. After she joined, Beale 
at first used the site for typical purposes, but 
eventually she took her use of LinkedIn to the 
next level after co-founding her consultancy 
business, Stecin Leadership Solutions. 
Beale and her co-founder, Steve Settimo, started 
Stecin as a consulting and training company 
focused on management and leadership training. 
The business partners spent two years develop-
ing an exclusive curriculum that can be custom-
ized for any size company. Recently, they created 
a brand-new board game called DISCFunctional 
to demonstrate the power of understanding the 
DISC Quadrant behavior system (see the follow-
ing figure for the layout). This game became a 
popular training tool, and Stecin’s co-founders 
decided to use the power of their LinkedIn net-
works to help advance the game. 

305
 Chapter 18: Miscellaneous Creative Uses of LinkedIn
Here are some ideas to keep in mind if you want to build your own focus 
group using LinkedIn: 
 
 Start by building your network. Your best participants in this group are 
first-degree connections of yours (or of another employee of your com-
pany) because those people are most likely to join based on your recom-
mendation and how well they fit your group’s purpose. Try to network 
and invite potential candidates right away. 
 
 Build your accompanying Web site before building the group. Your 
focus group participants will want to see something before deciding to 
join and participate, so make sure you’ve spent some time building an 
informational Web page, e-mail, FAQ, or other system that is available 
for viewing before you start to build your group.
 
 Use your first-degree connections to expand your network. After you’ve 
rustled up some involvement there, expand your group by asking for referrals 
or Introductions to potential second- and third-degree network members or 
general LinkedIn members who might get some value and add some insight 
to your process. 
 
 Continually send out updates. You always should be sending out some 
form of update, whether you do so by filling out the “I’m working on” 
option, using LinkedIn Messages, or going through your own e-mail 
system. (See Chapter 9 for more information about these options.) Don’t 
deluge people with messages — but also don’t ask them to sign up and 
then be silent for weeks or months at a time. Keep your group members 
informed and ask for input when needed. 
Beale explains, “Suddenly, we had a way to 
communicate information about our training and 
consulting business to a group of people that 
we already identified as knowing.” They added 
the game to their profiles and included a Web 
site link in each of their profiles so that potential 
customers could actually order the game. They 
updated their network with progress reports on 
how the game was doing, and then they created 
a special DISCFunctional group on LinkedIn for 
contacts who wanted to learn more. 
This LinkedIn group became a focus group for 
Stecin Leadership Solutions, as they invited 
first-degree connections who expressed inter-
est and potential customers who learned about 
the product elsewhere. Beale and Settimo were 
very careful about how they invited people to 
this focus group, doing research on each poten-
tial invitee, asking for Introductions through their 
own personal LinkedIn networks whenever pos-
sible, and crafting a polished invitation.
Stecin has built a growing community that has 
been very influential in the game’s development. 
Beale is happy to report that their first training 
contract came from a LinkedIn connection! She 
concludes by saying, “We are always looking 
for more ways to utilize LinkedIn to reach people 
who will benefit from our business offerings.” 

306
Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Ask for recommendations. As group members get introduced to your prod-
uct, ask them for a recommendation on your profile if they liked or approve 
of the product. Getting their feedback or recommendations will help to build 
future involvement when your product is live and ready for the mass market. 
Location-Based LinkedIn Ideas
It’s easy to forget the importance of location when you have easy access to 
such a resource-rich community as LinkedIn. After all, you can communi-
cate with your contacts through LinkedIn Messages, send Recommendation 
requests or post questions, or grow your network without leaving your com-
puter. When you’re done using your computer, however, you need to inter-
act in the real world, whether your interaction amounts to shoveling snow 
or catching a plane to a far-flung convention. When it comes to what I call 
“location-based” situations, meaning that the problem or situation is tied to a 
physical spot, you can discover solutions through involving LinkedIn. 
The best use of LinkedIn for location-based problems is this: Your network is 
typically spread out across the country and across the world. Therefore, not 
only can you tap someone’s professional experience, you can also tap their 
knowledge or presence in a specific geographical area to help you solve a 
problem. Let’s take a look at three different location-based situations. 
Building your network before 
moving to a new city
These days, when you have to move to a new city, you can do a lot of plan-
ning for it on the Internet. You can research the neighborhoods, look into 
the school systems, and shop for homes online. You can take this one step 
further if you plan to move to a different country, and you need information 
on local customs, cultures, and practices. But what about the questions you 
can’t seem to answer through a Web browser? What about the “local knowl-
edge” of where to go and where to avoid? Thankfully, LinkedIn can help. 
Every LinkedIn user has defined his or her location, so you can do a search 
and figure out which LinkedIn users live in your target area. If nobody in your 
network is from your target area, start networking and expand that network 
to include people who reside (or used to reside) in that area who can help. 
Here are some specific actions you can take through LinkedIn to help you 
with the big move:

307
 Chapter 18: Miscellaneous Creative Uses of LinkedIn
 
 Use LinkedIn Answers to ask the community. Not every question on 
LinkedIn Answers is directly related to software development or venture 
capital. You can post your dilemma on LinkedIn Answers (see Chapter 
7 for more information on how to do this), notify your network of your 
question, and see what the community says in response. Take a look 
at Figure 18-4, which shows how a young Australian looked for advice 
about moving to New York City by posting a detailed question. After he 
posted that question, he received 12 different responses filled with 
general and specific information to help him out. 
 
 When you post your question, be sure to select the My Question Is 
Focused around a Specific Geographic Location box and enter the ZIP 
code of your destination in the newly enabled text box next to the check 
box you just selected. 
 
 Start as early as possible. Building a region-specific network will take 
time as you recruit new members, ask your existing contacts for refer-
rals, and search for specific people who match the location and either 
an industry or job title. As soon as you sense that a move is necessary, 
or maybe when you’re mulling over whether to move, start building your 
network so that you can tap those people for location-specific informa-
tion before you actually move. 
 
 Look for contacts who used to live in your new city. You might try 
entering the location of your new city in the Keyword search field rather 
than the Location field. By doing so, you might find first- or second-
degree contacts who used to live in your target area but have since 
moved; they might reference their past location in their profile. Contact 
those people and see whether they can introduce you to any contacts 
they may still have in that target area, regardless of whether those 
contacts are on or off LinkedIn. 
Hello? Any opportunities out east? 
Chuck Hester had a problem. He had to relo-
cate his family from California to Raleigh, North 
Carolina, and he didn’t have a job for himself 
when he would arrive. In fact, he didn’t know 
anyone in Raleigh! But what he did have was a 
rich LinkedIn network. Hester quickly saw the 
value of LinkedIn and started contacting people 
and building relationships, driving his number of 
connections into the thousands. 
Hester started networking with everyone he 
could who was located in Raleigh. He tapped 
his existing network to put him in touch with 
like-minded individuals who lived in the area 
and kept searching for contacts. One of the 
contacts he made was the chief executive of 
iContact, an e-mail marketing company. Hester 
turned this contact into a job interview, and 
today he’s the corporate communications man-
ager for iContact. Even virtual persistence can 
pay off! Today, Hester continues to grow his 
LinkedIn network, for himself and for iContact, 
and he even encourages his local contacts in 
Raleigh to network “Live”, or use LinkedIn Live, 
to be specific — a feature that I cover later this 
chapter.

Arranging face-to-face meetings 
when traveling
LinkedIn can serve as a wonderful resource even when you’re not moving to 
another city but are just traveling for business, a convention, or even per-
sonal reasons. Say that you know you have some extra time on your trip, or 
you want to make some local connections to reinforce your business trip. 
Why not tap your LinkedIn network and visit your contacts in person? 
A growing practice of busy LinkedIn professionals who travel is to arrange 
face-to-face visits with other LinkedIn members on a business trip. This way, 
the traveler can meet with someone they are familiar with who could share 
similar interests and goals. Also, both people get a chance to expand their 
network by creating a stronger connection. To bring about in-person meet-
ings, most people either post something to LinkedIn Answers or send a mes-
sage to targeted members of their network. 
If you’re interested in making your next trip more of a LinkedIn adventure, 
keep these tips in mind:

 Chapter 18: Miscellaneous Creative Uses of LinkedIn
 
 Provide enough notice to attract people’s attention. If you’re putting up 
a post on Monday night that you’re available for Tuesday lunch, you prob-
ably won’t get many responses in time to set up anything meaningful. 
 
 Give too much notice and your visit will be forgotten by the time you 
arrive. Some notice is necessary to get on people’s calendars, but too 
much notice will make people forget when your visit gets closer. More 
than two to four weeks in advance is probably too much notice.
 
 Be specific with your availability. It’s great that you want to get 
together, but you probably have other plans when you’re visiting. 
Therefore, when you contact other members, offer a few choices of 
when you can get together — and be specific. For example, you could 
say, “Hey, I’m going to be in San Jose for most of next week. Who’s avail-
able either Monday night or Wednesday lunchtime to get together?”
 
 Use your get-together to help prepare for business. Your get-togethers 
with people in other cities don’t have to be purely social. Say that you 
know you’re traveling to that city for an interview. Perhaps you want to 
send a targeted message to a few contacts who used to work for your 
target company and ask to meet them in person before your interview 
so that they can help you prepare. Or maybe you want to practice your 
sales presentation on a knowledgeable person before you go into some-
one’s office to do the real thing. 
LinkedIn networking. . . in person!
Social networking is definitely a great way to stay connected, grow your per-
sonal and professional contact list, and learn about new opportunities. But 
after lots of e-mails, Instant Messages, and discussion boards, sometimes you 
just want the experience of meeting someone face to face. Lots of LinkedIn 
members have felt this way and have used the virtual power of LinkedIn to 
bring together people in the real world. 
You can find all sorts of “chapters” of in-person networking groups inspired 
by people first meeting on LinkedIn and then connecting in-person with 
people from their network at a live event. Besides LinkedIn Live in Raleigh, 
I’ve discovered LinkedIn Live or LinkedIn Face-to-Face events in Phoenix, 
Chicago, and Philadephia, and there may well be more.
To find or organize a LinkedIn Live group from your network, here are some 
tips to keep in mind:
 
 Search LinkedIn Answers to see whether anyone’s tried to organize 
a group. Do an Advanced Answers search and put in the word LinkedIn 
and a word such as Live, Face to Face, or In Person; also, include the 
city or region where you live. You might find a posting from someone 
like Chuck Hester, who started LinkedIn Live in Raleigh by posting some-
thing and alerting his network, as shown in Figure 18-5.

Part V: Using LinkedIn for Everyday Business 
 
 Search LinkedIn Groups to see whether a group exists in your area. 
Click Groups and then Groups Directory to see whether a Networking 
or Professional group of LinkedIn members shows up in your area. For 
example, when I looked at Networking Groups, I saw LinkedIn groups 
in places as diverse as New York City, Pasadena, and Silicon Valley, as 
shown in Figure 18-6. 
 
 Use the Internet to look for social networking meetings. You may have 
to go outside LinkedIn to find an eager group of LinkedIn members. If 
you do a search with something like Google, you might find something 
like this posting, shown in Figure 18-7, that I found for a LinkedIn Live in 
Chicago. Another great site to find potential meetings is Meetup.com. 
LinkedIn Live
If you use LinkedIn and you’re in the Raleigh-
Durham area of North Carolina, odds are you’ve 
heard of Chuck Hester. “I’m known as the Kevin 
Bacon of Raleigh,” he smiles. “If I don’t know a 
person, I probably know someone who does.” 
He’s the creator of LinkedIn Live Raleigh, an 
informal networking group formed in July 2007 
and dedicated to having Hester’s virtual con-
nections meet up with each other in person so 
that they could increase their own networking. 
By that time, Hester had built up more than 700 
connections in the Raleigh area alone, so he 
sent out an invitation and 50 people showed up 
to the event. The event was such a success that 
meetings are now held every other month, and 
attendance has grown exponentially, more than 
tripling in the first six months. In fact, Hester 
doesn’t have to worry about the costs because 
he gets sponsors to donate the food, meeting 
space, and even door prizes! 
Hester receives calls from more than a dozen 
other similar LinkedIn groups, each asking for 
advice on how to set up and maintain these live 
networking events. He’s proud of the results 
from all this live networking, saying “At least 
20–30 people have found new jobs from meet-
ing someone at a LinkedIn Live.” Of course, 
he has used the opportunity to build brand 
recognition for his company, iContact, which 
he found by networking on LinkedIn. (See the 
“Hello? Any opportunities out east?” sidebar, 
earlier this chapter) The LinkedIn Live Raleigh 
networking has also earned him mentions in 
the Fast Company blog, the Wall Street Journal, 
Inc. magazine, and The New York Times. You 
can find out more by reading Hester’s blog at: 
http://thepayitforwardchron-
icles.blogspot.com. And if you’re in 
Raleigh, check out a LinkedIn Live event!

 If nothing exists, start your own live group. Post something on LinkedIn 
Answers and try to build a core group to start the first event. Send an 
update or message to your network members who live in the area and 
encourage them to pass along the message to their local friends who are 
LinkedIn members. 
Andrew Warner turned to LinkedIn to help find interest for a regular get-
together of technology folks known as Lunch 2.0, for which companies 
involved in Web 2.0 technologies open their doors to hungry technology 
workers who then learn about their host company over lunch. He posted a 
question on LinkedIn Answers to find a host company (see Figure 18-8) and 
got several responses, which led to some great meetings!

In this part . . .
You’ve made it! In this final part of the book, I present 
a beloved tradition in the For Dummies world: the 
Part of Tens. I’ve created a great list of ten do’s and 
don’ts, as well as a list of ten useful resources you can 
find on the Internet to make your LinkedIn experience that 
much richer. Use them wisely, for while the right tips will 
bring you lots of success, the wrong tips will . . . eh, prob-
ably just slow you down a bit.

I
 cover a lot of ground in this book — so much that it might be hard to 
remember it all as you’re going about your daily use of LinkedIn. So here 
are ten essential do’s and don’ts to help you build relationships and get the 
most value out of LinkedIn.
Keep Your Profile Complete and Current
Even though LinkedIn has many features, your profile is still one of the most 
compelling reasons to use the Web site, which is why LinkedIn is one of the 
best searchable databases of businesspeople available. And if you want to be 
found by others, you need to make sure that your data is complete and cur-
rent. Here are a couple of ways to do that:
 
 List all your former employers and schools. Several features help users 
find and connect with former colleagues and classmates (see Chapter 6). 
Including your complete work and educational background in your pro-
file can help you reconnect. 
 
 If you’ve had a lengthy career, you don’t necessarily need to include 
details about positions early in your career — just the companies and 
titles will suffice. A good guideline is to include details on just the last 
7–10 years. Additionally, you may only include positions that are rele-
vant to your current work. I seriously doubt my first job at a McDonald’s 
is relevant to my current work as an author, except if I want to write the 
sequel to Fast Food Nation. 

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Update your profile (and headline) any time you achieve a new posi-
tion or complete a major side project. Your direct connections will be 
notified (assuming they haven’t turned off the feature) of the change. 
This is a subtle, unobtrusive way to notify your network of your career 
changes. And you never know when someone is going to be looking for 
what you have to offer. Make sure that, if you have a new position, you 
update your e-mail address with your new corporate e-mail address so 
people can still reach and invite you. 
Don’t Use Canned Invitations
There is never ever a good situation in which to use one of the default 
Invitation text messages LinkedIn provides when you send someone an 
Invitation to join your network on LinkedIn. Nothing says, “You’re not really 
worth a few extra seconds of my time,” quite like the all-too-familiar “I’d like 
to add you to my professional network” message. 
That doesn’t mean every Invitation has to be a lengthy personal epistle. Here 
are a few tips for keeping Invitations efficient but personal.
 
 Keep it short when you can. With people you know well and have been 
in recent contact with, the canned messages are actually too long. The 
message can be as simple as this:
 
 Great to see you last night, Jerry — let’s connect.
 
 Make sure you know whether the person is already a LinkedIn member. 
Someone who’s already a member doesn’t need to be convinced of 
LinkedIn’s benefits. Maybe it shouldn’t be annoying to them that you’re 
explaining something they already know, but it’s just an indication that 
you didn’t really put any thought into making the connection.
 
 If the contact is not already a member, offer to help with the registra-
tion process. You can try to explain the benefits of joining LinkedIn in 
an e-mail, but almost no matter what you do, it’s going to come across 
as a sales pitch, or at least a bit evangelistic. The best way to persuade 
people is to offer to spend a few minutes on the phone explaining it and 
how you’re using it. That also turns the Invitation into an opportunity to 
strengthen your relationship with that person by offering your time to 
bring them something of value.
 
 You can still personalize a batch of Invitations. You can give the 
Invitation a personal touch even if you’re sending it to multiple people. 
For example, you can send the same Invitation to all the people you met 
or ran into at an event. Or you can write out one Invitation to everyone 
in your chamber of commerce. Just remember to write it as if it were 
going to one person, not the whole group.
For more on Invitations, see Chapter 2.

 Chapter 19: Ten LinkedIn Do’s and Don’ts
Don’t Expect Everyone to 
Network Like You Do
Setting rigid networking expectations can be a source of needless frustration 
and can actually prevent you from building relationships with some pretty 
great people. Here are some of the common issues that arise:
 
 Different people have different standards for connecting. Some people 
use LinkedIn to connect only with people they know very well. Some 
connect only with people with whom they share some common points 
of interest. Others connect with anybody. None of these approaches are 
wrong. If some people don’t have the same standard for a connection 
that you do, don’t take it personally, and don’t judge them — they’re 
doing what’s right for them. 
 
 People might have perfectly good reasons not to allow other people 
to browse their LinkedIn connections list. Don’t hold anything against 
people who don’t enable it. People may be concerned about client 
confidentiality, and thus be required to keep their connections secret. 
Or they may be connected to a competitor and not want their bosses 
and co-workers to know about it. Or they may just be concerned about 
their time commitments and not want to handle a growing number of 
Introduction requests if all their friends see their long list of connec-
tions. However, even if a person has disabled connections browsing, 
you can still get Introductions to people they know. Frankly, if you’re 
just browsing other people’s networks, maybe you should think about a 
more focused approach.
 
 Not everyone responds in a timely manner. If your request doesn’t get 
forwarded or your InMail hasn’t been replied to after a couple of weeks, 
don’t take it personally. It doesn’t mean that you’re unimportant — it 
means the people you’re trying to contact are busy. If it’s really urgent, 
pick up the phone.
 
 Some people are bad with names. Just because you remember some-
body’s name doesn’t mean she remembers yours. Unless you are 100 
percent certain she will recognize your Invitation, contact her via e-mail 
or phone or a LinkedIn Introduction request before sending a connec-
tion request. Otherwise, don’t be surprised when she declines your 
Invitation or hits the I Don’t Know button.
 
 Relationships aren’t always symmetrical. For example, if you were some-
one’s client, you might be able to provide a great recommendation for him. 
That doesn’t mean that he can do the same for you, so don’t expect it.
 
 Not everyone networks just to network. Some people are extremely 
busy and not receptive to “I’d just like to meet you” requests. It’s noth-
ing personal, and it doesn’t mean they’re bad networkers. It just means 
that the demands on their time exceed the supply.

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Do Your Homework
People provide you all kinds of guidance, both direct and implicit, regarding 
what to contact them about and how. If you’re the one initiating the commu-
nication, it’s your responsibility to communicate on their terms. And showing 
that you’ve taken the time to do your homework about them demonstrates a 
certain level of commitment to the relationship right from the outset.
The most basic rule of good conversation is to listen. In the context of 
LinkedIn, that rule means simply this: Pay attention to what’s on a person’s 
profile. Any time you contact somebody, review her profile first, as well as 
her contact settings. Respect what you see in her profile and contact settings.
So for example, suppose you have a business deal or a job inquiry that you 
want to contact John Smith about, but his profile says he’s not accepting 
such inquiries right now. Don’t think that you know better than John does 
about whether he might be interested, and definitely don’t try to pass off 
your deal or job inquiry as a mere “expertise request” or a “request to recon-
nect” and then tell him why you’re really contacting him.
When you send an Introduction request or an Invitation to someone you 
don’t know very well, don’t put the burden on her to figure out what the 
common areas of interest or potential opportunities are. You took the time 
to read her profile and determine that it’s a worthwhile connection. Save 
her the trouble of figuring out what you already know and put your common 
areas of interest in your Introduction request or Invitation.
Give LinkedIn Messages Equal 
Importance
Many people have a tendency to treat LinkedIn communications as less 
important or less time-sensitive than an official e-mail or phone call.
Nothing could be further from the truth. People get jobs, hire employees, gain 
clients, and make deals as a result of LinkedIn-based communications. They 
are every bit as much a part of your essential business correspondence as the 
rest of your e-mail. (If they’re not, you’re connecting with the wrong people!)
Here are some tips for managing your LinkedIn communications: 
 
 Don’t turn off e-mail notifications. Missing time-sensitive communica-
tions is one of the worst things you can do. If the volume of e-mail seems 
overwhelming, you can use e-mail rules to move LinkedIn requests into 
a separate folder, but as a general productivity practice, you want as few 
different inboxes as possible.

321
 Chapter 19: Ten LinkedIn Do’s and Don’ts
 
 To make sure you have e-mail notifications set up correctly, go to 
this URL:
 
 www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?msgdelivprefs
 
 You see the Receiving Messages screen, as shown in Figure 19-1. Here, 
you can set up what will come to you as an individual e-mail, a digest 
e-mail, or no e-mail (by setting Web Only) so you can decide what is 
most important. 
 
Figure 19-1: 
Set your 
e-mail noti-
fications so 
you don’t 
miss an 
important 
message.
 
 
 Handle your LinkedIn inbox every day. Or at least every couple of 
days. You wouldn’t go a week without checking your e-mail at work— 
don’t treat LinkedIn messages any differently. (See Chapter 9 on how to 
manage your LinkedIn inbox.)
 
 Do it, delegate it, defer it, or delete it. This technique from David 
Allen’s book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity 
(Penguin) will help you keep your inbox organized. As you’re going 
through your inbox, if you can handle a request in under two minutes, 
go ahead and do it. Or you can delegate it by passing on the Introduction 
request or recommend one of your contacts as an expert to answer the 
person’s question. If it will take a little more time, you can defer it by 
putting it into your work queue to handle later.
For additional tips on e-mail organization and productivity, check out David 
Allen’s book Getting Things Done, and also take a look at 43 Folders’ Inbox 
Zero collection at www.inboxzero.com.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Spam
One person’s networking is another person’s spam. Better to err on the side 
of caution. There are plenty of ways to use LinkedIn productively without get-
ting a bad rep as a spammer. Some basic rules of etiquette are
 
 Don’t post marketing messages, job listings, job search queries, or con-
nection-seeking messages on Answers. All of these will get your mes-
sage flagged and fairly quickly removed. Don’t waste your effort. There’s 
a fine line between an advertisement and market or product research 
that calls attention to your company, which I cover in Chapter 7.
 
 Don’t automatically subscribe your connections to your newsletter. 
This is admittedly a gray area. Connecting with someone indicates a 
certain level of receptivity to receiving communication from them, and 
it’s reasonable to assume that should include something more than just 
LinkedIn Introduction requests. After all, they’re supposed to be some-
one you know and trust, right? Well, that’s not necessarily the same 
thing as signing up for a regular bulk newsletter. 
 
 I think it’s better to be safe than sorry, so I don’t recommend auto-sub-
scribing folks to your newsletter. People can get ticked off if they sud-
denly start getting some newsletter they didn’t subscribe to. 
 
 The best approach is simply to ask permission to subscribe your indi-
vidual contacts to your newsletter. If you get their permission, even if 
they do complain later, you can politely point out that you asked first.
 
 Don’t send connection requests to people you don’t know. Unless 
they’ve given some kind of explicit indication that they’re open to receiv-
ing Invitations (for example, announcing it on a forum, stating it in their 
profiles, or being a member of an open networking group), you have 
to assume that most people don’t want to receive LinkedIn connection 
Invitations from strangers. LinkedIn has taken measures to curb such 
rampant inviting behavior, and it will get you suspended soon enough. 
Again, there’s a simple solution: Ask permission first. Send an Introduction 
request, or contact the person via e-mail or his Web site, and ask whether 
it would be okay for you to send him a connection Invitation.
Be Proactive about Making New 
Connections
If you just set up a profile, connect with a few of your contacts, and then 
expect business to come your way, you’re setting yourself up for disappoint-
ment. That’s not to say that it can’t happen, but being a little bit proactive 
goes a long way.

323
 Chapter 19: Ten LinkedIn Do’s and Don’ts
 
 Search for people who can help you with your goals. If you want to 
meet people in a particular city, industry, or target market, search for 
them specifically and make Introduction requests. Some people will be 
receptive to corresponding or talking just for networking purposes, but 
you’ll get a better response if you have a specific need or opportunity as 
the basis of your contact.
 
 Introduce people to each other. LinkedIn’s basic Introduction paradigm 
is reactive. For example, an Introduction is made when person A wants 
to connect with person C via person B. But an essential practice of a 
good networker is identifying possible connections between people in 
your network and introducing them to each other. You can do this by 
forwarding one person’s profile to the other and Cc’ing the first person 
(see Chapter 5). You can send a LinkedIn message to both connections 
introducing them and telling them why you think they should get to 
know each other. You can also recommend someone in your network as 
an expert resource when answering questions in LinkedIn Answers.
 
 Seek out questions to answer. Your direct connections can send you 
questions that they think you may have a good answer for, but that 
won’t help you meet new people. However, answering a single question 
in the Answers section allows you to interact with dozens, hundreds, or 
even thousands of people. Find the Answers categories that are related 
to your business and either check them regularly, or better yet, sub-
scribe to them via RSS (see Chapter 18).
 
 Ask questions. The Answers section is the main form of public group 
interaction on LinkedIn. You can ask questions for highly focused activi-
ties like market research, or you can aim for more general relationship-
building by posing thought-provoking questions on relevant topics. One 
question can make dozens of new contacts for you and initiate private 
conversations around a topic currently relevant to your business.
Cross-Promote
Your LinkedIn profile is just one Web page of your total Web presence. It 
should connect people to your other points of presence, and you probably 
want to direct people to your LinkedIn profile from other venues as well. 
Here are some good cross-promotion practices:
 
 Customize your LinkedIn profile links. As described in Chapter 3, you can 
create up to three links on your profile that you can use to lead people to 
your business site(s), personal site, blog, your book, an event, and so on.
 
 Include a link to your LinkedIn profile in your signature. You can use 
this both in your e-mail signature and also on discussion forums. If you 
don’t have a centralized personal professional Web site, your LinkedIn 
profile is a good alternative. I even cover how LinkedIn can help you 
create your e-mail signature in Chapter 10. 

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Link to your LinkedIn profile in your blog’s About page. Why rehash 
your entire bio? Put a couple of paragraphs that are relevant to the blog 
and then refer people to your LinkedIn profile for more details.
 
 Put your LinkedIn URL on your business card. It’s not commonplace 
yet, but more and more people are starting to do this.
Add Value to the Process
LinkedIn is based on the idea that existing relationships add value to the 
process of people meeting each other. If all you’re doing is just passing the 
Introduction “bucket” down the virtual bucket brigade, you’re actually get-
ting in the way of communication, not adding value.
To add value, you have to give those Introduction requests some thought. Is 
it an appropriate fit for the recipient? Is the timing good?
Add your comments to the Introduction request. Do you know the sender? 
In the context of the request? Saying “I worked with Michael Bellomo for sev-
eral years as a co-author and he was hard-working, trust-worthy, and ambi-
tious” goes a lot further than saying, “Hey, Francine, here’s this guy Michael 
to check out.” For additional guidance on how to handle this tactfully, see 
Chapter 5.
Don’t Confuse Quantity with Quality
Just because you’re doing a lot of something doesn’t mean you’re doing some-
thing well. And when you think about it, is more networking activity what you 
really want? Or do you really want more results with less activity?
If you want to track your real progress using LinkedIn, don’t measure it by 
meaningless metrics like number of connections, endorsements, or questions 
answered. Use metrics that you know directly tie to business results, such as
 
 Leads generated
 
 Joint venture/strategic partner prospects generated
 
 Qualified job candidates contacted
 
 Qualified employers successfully contacted
 
 Interviews scheduled
 
 Speaking opportunities
 
 Publicity opportunities
Any of these may be a key performance metric for you; the number of LinkedIn 
connections you have or questions you’ve answered isn’t one of them.

My Virtual Power Forum
www.mylinkedinpowerforum.com
As LinkedIn users began to develop their profiles and grow their networks, 
some of them wanted a place to go to discuss plans and swap ideas with each 
other. Therefore, in 2005, several users started the My LinkedIn Power Forum 
as a Yahoo! group where members could post messages, share ideas, and ask 
questions of other members. Today, they bill themselves as My Virtual Power 
Forum, a “networking and discussion group about building professional 
social media networks at ultimate networker speed.” 
Membership is open and free, but the forum members stress that you 
should consider their five recommendations for using LinkedIn to build your 
network: 
 
1. Don’t build in the dark. Be aware of the image and network you’re creating.
 
2. Don’t build without a vision. Think about the purpose of your LinkedIn 
profile and goals for your LinkedIn network.
 
3. Don’t build too fast or too slow. You don’t have to achieve one million 
connections in 24 hours, but one connection per year is too slow.
 
4. Don’t build without a written plan. List out some goals and milestones 
for creating your LinkedIn identity.
 
5. Don’t build without profiting. As you grow your LinkedIn identity, you 
should be benefiting from some new connections, a job lead, or some 
other profit, which may or may not involve money.
LinkedInLIONS Forum
http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/linkedinlions
Throughout this book, I comment on the presence of LinkedIn open network-
ers, or LIONs for short. These are LinkedIn users who hope to network with 
as many people as possible and accept Introductions and Invitations from 
anybody. Some LIONs have started their own Yahoo! group to swap ideas, 
grow their networks, and talk about their open networking experiences. 
Although not all of their information will apply to every visitor, they have still 
built up a lively discussion of all things LinkedIn. 
Similar to My Virtual Power Forum, this is a Yahoo! group that you can join 
for free and participate in openly.

MyLinkWiki
http://linkedin.pbwiki.com
A wiki is a newer Internet technology that allows multiple people to col-
laborate on gathering and presenting information. On a wiki site, anybody 
can create, add, or edit information on the site, and those changes are then 
reviewed by other users, and ultimately those changes are approved or 
rejected. The best known example of this technology is Wikipedia, one of the 
fastest growing repositories of information on the Internet. This online ency-
clopedia has rapidly become an authoritative source of information because 
of the collaborative knowledge gathering. 
One great LinkedIn wiki is MyLinkWiki, which has users commenting and 
updating on the width and breadth of LinkedIn’s functionality and usefulness. 
As you become more familiar with LinkedIn, you can contribute to this grow-
ing community as well!
RSS Feeds with Google Reader
http://reader.google.com
A relatively new Web technology known as RSS (commonly referred to as 
Really Simple Syndication) works as follows: If you wanted to follow all the 
changes, additions, and updates of a Web site, blog, or profile page, the 
easiest way is to read a list of just the information that has changed or been 
added, rather than seeing the entire site over and over again. An RSS feed 
provides this list of new information, 
Many active LinkedIn users maintain an RSS feed for their profile, so their 
friends and connections can get a list of the changes and updates. You can 
create an RSS feed of your Network Updates, so you can keep track of your 
first-degree connections on LinkedIn. In addition, LinkedIn Answers provides 
RSS feeds for the growing number of categories that contain questions and 
answers from the community. Therefore, if you want to stay informed on 
your friends changes and updates, you need something called an RSS feed 
reader. I cover LinkedIn RSS Feeds in more depth in Chapter 18. 
Google makes a great tool called Google Reader, which you can use to handle 
all the RSS feeds you subscribe to, whether or not it’s related to LinkedIn. It’s 
a free tool that you can install on practically any system. There are also other 
feed readers you can install and use for your RSS feed needs.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
LinkedIntelligence Blog
www.linkedintelligence.com 
When LinkedIn was growing a few years ago, blogger Scott Allen put together 
a site called LinkedIntelligence to cover LinkedIn and its many uses. Over the 
years, he built up a healthy amount of blog posts, links, and valuable informa-
tion from himself and other bloggers regarding LinkedIn and how to use it. 
One of his more ambitious projects started in May 2007, simply dubbed 100+ 
Smart Ways to Use LinkedIn. Allen had bloggers compete to provide valuable 
information and tips across all of LinkedIn’s functions, and he created a table 
of contents of the best entries on his blog site. You can still find this handy 
resource at:
www.linkedintelligence.com/smart-ways-to-use-linkedin
The large repository of links and information can be helpful to new, interme-
diate, or power users of the site. The blog posts are divided into dozens of 
helpful categories, from LinkedIn News to Training & Coaching. 
Podcast Network Connections
http://connections.thepodcastnetwork.com
The staggering popularity of the Apple iPod gave rise to a new way of broad-
casting audio information to eager listeners — the podcast. Think of the 
podcast as a recorded audio broadcast that you can download to your iPod, 
computer, MP3 player, or other device. You can subscribe to engaging and 
unique podcasts, regardless of where in the world they are recorded and 
played. 
If you go to The Podcast Network (http://thepodcastnetwork.com), 
you can find the Connections show, where show host Stan Relihan prepares 
a weekly audio podcast about the art of business networking. This 20-minute 
podcast features interviews that Relihan does with other members of his net-
work of connections to discuss how different social networks (like LinkedIn 
and Facebook, as well as new Web applications) can be used to provide a 
benefit to any business. You can subscribe to this show and hear great inter-
views, tips, and stories of how other people and companies connect online.

 Chapter 20: Ten Helpful LinkedIn Resources
MyLinkSearch Search Engine
www.mylinksearch.com
A couple of years ago, Marc Freedman wanted a better way to search through 
LinkedIn and related LinkedIn Web sites. Rather than going through different 
sites manually, he created the MyLinkSearch search engine, which is a part 
of Google Co-Op. This custom search engine digs through 21 different Web 
sites, including LinkedIn and their extensive database of users, and displays 
one list of relevant results. 
This custom search engine can be very helpful, especially in these situations:
 
 You want to expand your LinkedIn search to include information, help, 
and support resources. 
 
 You want to see Google-style searching and formatting compared to a 
direct LinkedIn search.
 
 You want to see public LinkedIn profiles of LinkedIn members who are 
not in your direct network. 
 
 You want to find LinkedIn open networkers who publicize their e-mail 
addresses. 
 
Marc is a part of the DallasBlue Business Network, dedicated to providing in-
person and online events and programs for both their local Dallas–Ft. Worth 
area and throughout the world. This group appeals to networkers, all levels 
of executives, entrepreneurs, small business owners, and working profession-
als. The group has an impressive array of functions and information regarding 
LinkedIn. You can go to www.dallasblue.com to find out more. 
Take Your Profile with You 
with LinkedInABox
www.linkedinabox.com
For many Internet users, their LinkedIn profile is simply one aspect of their 
overall online identities. However, some of these users have built up impres-
sive LinkedIn profiles and, rather than duplicating the information on their 
other Web sites, would rather display their LinkedIn profiles dynamically 
across their online identities, so any changes to their LinkedIn profiles will 
ripple out automatically to these other sites without lots of work. 

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
There is a solution — LinkedInABox! This is a special Web software applica-
tion, or widget, that was written to be installed on your blog or Web page. 
This piece of code draws a box on your Web page and dynamically shows 
your public LinkedIn profile every time! You just have to cut and paste a few 
lines of code into the HTML source code for your Web page or the profile sec-
tion of your blog software, and LinkedInABox does the rest! 
 
LinkedInABox is just one of a growing number of widgets available that take 
advantage of LinkedIn. Do a Google search for “linkedin widget” to find new 
applications, or check out LinkedIn’s new Widgets page at this URL:
www.linkedin.com/static?key=developers_widgets
One Update for Multiple 
Sites with Hello TXT
http://hellotxt.com 
If you’re active on LinkedIn and other social networking sites (like Facebook, 
MySpace, Twitter, and many others), you may find yourself going site to site 
to provide up-to-the-minute information about what you’re doing and what 
you want others to know. Well, instead of site hopping, you can use one 
function to update your status across all your social networking pages and 
microblogs. It’s called Hello TXT.
Hello TXT works like this: You log on to the site and enter your text message 
into the dashboard. You then select the sites you want to update with your 
new status message, and Hello TXT does the rest, reaching out to your vari-
ous pages to add your new status message. It’s a great centralized way to 
keep all your various profiles as up to date as possible and it is designed to 
update your LinkedIn status by answering the question “What are you work-
ing on?”
