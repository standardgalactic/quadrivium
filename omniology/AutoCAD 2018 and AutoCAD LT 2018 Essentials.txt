Introduction 
The staying power of the AutoCAD® program is legendary in the ever-chang-
ing software industry, having been around for 36 years by the 2018 release. 
You can rest assured that spending your time learning AutoCAD will be a wise 
investment, and the skills you obtain in this book will be useful for years to 
come.
I welcome you in beginning the process of learning AutoCAD®. It will give 
you great satisfaction to learn such a complex program and use it to design and 
document whatever you dream up. In this book, you’ll find step-by-step tutori-
als that reveal a wide variety of techniques built on many years of real-world 
experience.
The first 14 chapters apply to both AutoCAD® 2018 and AutoCAD LT® 2018. 
AutoCAD LT is Autodesk’s lower-cost version of AutoCAD, and it has reduced 
capabilities. Chapters 15 through 18 are for full AutoCAD users only, because 
they cover advanced tools not available in AutoCAD LT, including attributes, 3D 
navigation, 3D modeling, and rendering.
Who Should Read This Book
This book is for students, hobbyists, professional architects, industrial design-
ers, engineers, builders, landscape architects, or anyone who communicates 
through technical drawings as part of their work.
If you’re interested in certification for AutoCAD 2018, this book can be a  
great resource to help you prepare. See www.autodesk.com/ 
training-and-certification/certification for more certification 
information and resources. This book also features appendices that can help you 
focus your studies on the skills you will need for the certification exams.
What You Will Learn
You’ll gain a solid understanding of the features of AutoCAD in this book. Each 
chapter features multiple exercises that take you step by step through the 
many complex procedures of AutoCAD. The goal of performing these steps on 
your own is to develop skills that you can apply to many different real-world 
situations.
Although each project presents different obstacles and opportunities, I urge 
you to focus on the concepts and techniques presented rather than memorizing 

x i v 	
I nt r o d u c t i o n 	   
the specific steps used to achieve the desired result. The actual steps performed 
may vary in each geometric situation.
The best way to build skills is to perform the steps on your computer exactly 
as they are presented in the book during your first reading. After you achieve 
the desired result, start over and experiment using the same techniques on your 
own project (whether invented or real). After you have practiced, think about 
how you have achieved the desired result, and you will get the most out of this 
book.
Reader Requirements
You don’t need any previous experience with AutoCAD to use this book. 
However, you’ll need familiarity with either the Windows or Mac operating sys-
tem and the basic skills necessary to use a graphical user interface successfully 
and to operate a computer confidently.

What Is Covered in This Book
AutoCAD® 2018 and AutoCAD LT® 2018 Essentials is organized to provide you 
with the knowledge needed to master the basics of computer-aided design. The 
book’s web page is located at www.sybex.com/go/autocad2018essentials, 
where you can download the sample files used in each chapter.
Chapter 1: Getting Started    You’ll take a tour of the user interface and learn 
to identify each of its parts by name. Chapter 1 is essential reading because 
you’ll need to know the difference between workspaces, ribbon tabs, toolbars, 
panels, palettes, status toggles, and so on to understand the terminology used 
by your colleagues and in the rest of this book. In addition, you’ll learn how to 
match your industry’s standard units to the drawings you’ll be creating.
Chapter 2: Gaining Basic Drawing Skills    Learn how to navigate a 2D draw-
ing with Zoom and Pan so that you can zero in on areas of interest. You’ll learn 
how to draw lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, and polygons; how to cancel, erase, 
and undo; and how to fillet and chamfer lines. In addition, you’ll use two coordi-
nate systems to specify the exact sizes of objects you are drawing.
Chapter 3: Using Drawing Aids     Drawing aids are something you’ll want to  
learn how to use to create measured drawings with ease. The drawing aids cov-
ered with step-by-step exercises in this chapter include grid and snap, Ortho and 
Polar Tracking, PolarSnap, running object snaps, the From snap, and object snap 
tracking.
Chapter 4: Editing Entities     This chapter teaches what you’ll probably be 
doing most of the time in AutoCAD: editing the basic entities that you’ve drawn 

x v i 	
I nt r o d u c t i o n 	   
to make them conform with your design intent. Editing commands covered 
include Move, Copy, Rotate, Scale, Array, Trim, Extend, Lengthen, Stretch, 
Offset, and Mirror. In addition to these commands, you’ll learn an alternative 
method for editing entities called grip editing.
Chapter 5: Shaping Curves     The landscape exercise in this chapter teaches 
you how to create complex curves with NURBS-based splines, curved polylines, 
and ellipses. By the end, you’ll be able to shape curves to create almost any cur-
vilinear form imaginable.
Chapter 6: Controlling Object Visibility and Appearance     You’ll learn 
how to hide and reveal objects with properties and layers. Layers are essential to 
managing the complexity of design, and you’ll use many different layer tools in 
this chapter’s step-by-step exercises.
Chapter 7: Organizing Objects     By combining entities such as lines, poly-
lines, circles, arcs, and text into blocks and/or groups, you can more efficiently 
manipulate complex objects such as chairs, mechanical assemblies, trees, or any 
other organizational designation appropriate to your industry. You’ll learn how 
to create and work with blocks and groups in this chapter.
Chapter 8: Hatching and Gradients     In this chapter, you’ll flood bounded 
areas with solid fill, hatch patterns, and/or gradients to indicate transitions 
between materials and to improve the readability of drawings in general.
Chapter 9: Working with Blocks and Xrefs     You’ll learn how to access con-
tent from other files in the current drawing in this chapter. You’ll also under-
stand the important distinction between inserting and externally referencing 
content. In addition, you’ll store saved content on tool palettes for simplified 
reuse.
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Text     The written word is undeniably a 
part of every drawing. This chapter teaches you how to create both single- and 
multiline text, how to edit any text, and how to control its appearance through 
text styles and object properties.
Chapter 11: Dimensioning     You’ll learn how to annotate drawings with spe-
cific measurements known as dimensions in this chapter. In addition to learn-
ing how to control measurements’ appearance with dimension styles, you’ll 
create linear, aligned, angular, and radius dimension objects.
Chapter 12: Keeping In Control with Constraints     This chapter teaches 
you how to add geometric and dimensional constraints to objects so that their 
ultimate form is controlled by mathematical formulas. The formulas in the 

	
I nt r o d u c t i o n 	
x v i i 	   
examples are as simple as adding two dimensions or calculating the diameter of 
a circle from its radius.
Chapter 13: Working with Layouts and Annotative Objects     AutoCAD has 
two environments, which you’ll learn about in this chapter on layouts: model 
space and paper space. You’ll create floating viewports to display the contents of 
model space in the paper space of a layout. In addition, you’ll create annotative 
styles and objects that always display the proper height no matter which view-
port or annotation scale is selected.
Chapter 14: Printing and Plotting     From plotter drivers to plot style tables 
and page setups, you’ll learn the intricacies of creating printed output to scale 
in AutoCAD. You’ll plot in both model space and paper space, and you will even 
create electronic output that can be shared on the Internet.
Chapter 15: Working with Data     Attributes, fields, and tables are the sub-
jects of this chapter on managing data. You’ll learn how to embed nongraphical 
data in blocks, how to link to that data dynamically in text fields, and finally 
how to display and format this same data in an organized fashion in spread-
sheet-like tables.
Chapter 16: Navigating 3D Models     In this chapter, you’ll learn how to 
change your point of view while working on 3D models using the ViewCube®, 
the Orbit tool, and SteeringWheels® technologies. In addition, you’ll compose 
and save perspective views with cameras to help you visualize 3D models with 
added realism.
Chapter 17: Modeling in 3D     You’ll learn the basics of surface, solid, and 
mesh modeling in this chapter by building the 3D geometry you navigated in 
the previous chapter. Each 3D toolset has its strengths and limitations, and 
you’ll learn to use tools in each category to get the job done.
Chapter 18: Presenting and Documenting 3D Design     By assigning real-
istic materials, inserting artificial and natural light sources, and rendering the 
scene, you’ll create realistic computer-generated imagery in this chapter. By 
rendering in the cloud, you can keep working locally while your high-quality 
rendering is being processed remotely. You’ll also learn how to project 2D plans, 
sections, and detail drawings from a model so that you can dimension and docu-
ment 3D designs.
Appendix A: Making Isometric Drawings     This appendix teaches you 
how to make 2D isometric drawings that create the illusion of 3D objects. 
Isometric drawings provide a simple (and much more limited) alternative to the 

x v i i i 	
I nt r o d u c t i o n  
complexity of true 3D modeling. Isometric drawings are scaled equally in three 
planes separated with a common 120-degree angle between each of them.
Appendix B: Autodesk AutoCAD 2018 Certification     This appendix con-
tains information about how to prepare for Autodesk certification exams using 
this book. The tables point you to the chapters where you’ll find specific exam-
ples giving you practical experience with the topics covered in the exams.

Getting Started
As we begin this book on the AutoCAD® program, I’m reminded of a quote 
by Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu: “A journey of a thousand miles begins with 
a single step.” In much the same way, learning AutoCAD is something any-
one can do by taking it one step at a time. And I promise that AutoCAD is 
much easier than walking a thousand miles!
By buying this book, you have already taken the first step in this journey. 
When you finish, you will have a solid understanding of AutoCAD.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Sign in to Autodesk® 360 on the Start tab
▶
▶Explore the AutoCAD 2018 for Windows user interface
▶
▶Set drawing units
Sign In to Autodesk 360 on the Start Tab
Autodesk 360 is a cloud-based service that is integrated with AutoCAD. You 
have the option of automatically storing up to 5 GB of your drawing files in 
the cloud for free. The files you store in the cloud can be edited online and 
shared with others with your permission.
The Start tab appears when you launch the program. You can create new 
drawings, access existing drawings, connect to AutoCAD 360, receive noti-
fications, and access a live chat with sales on the Try page that appears on 
trial versions, all on the Start tab.

Explore the AutoCAD 2018 for Windows 
User Interface
Autodesk has recently released new versions of AutoCAD, including the 
AutoCAD® 2018 and AutoCAD LT® 2018 software. The two Windows versions 
look nearly identical and function in almost the same way. The main difference 
between them is that AutoCAD LT doesn’t support automation and some of the 
advanced 3D functions. Although this book was written using AutoCAD 2018 
running on Windows 7, you can use it to learn any of the current versions of 
AutoCAD.
Exercise 1.2: Explore the Graphical User 
Interface
Before you can use AutoCAD, you’ll need to familiarize yourself thoroughly 
with its graphical user interface (GUI). Figure 1.4 shows the AutoCAD 2018 (for 
Windows) user interface.
▶
AutoCAD for Mac has a 
user interface that is 
customized to the Mac 
experience. Although 
the Mac user interface 
is not covered in this 
book, its commands and 
capabilities are similar 
to those in AutoCAD for 
Windows (albeit with a 
slightly reduced set of 
features).

AutoCAD Drawing Spaces
AutoCAD has two types of drawing spaces: paper and model. Paper space is a 
two-dimensional area analogous to, and having the dimensions of, a sheet of 
paper. Various sizes of “paper” can be created in individual layouts (see Chapter 13, 
“Working with Layouts and Annotative Objects”). Model space, on the other hand, 
is a single three-dimensional volume where everything is drawn in actual size. 
The DWG format has 
been updated in 
AutoCAD 2018, improv-
ing opening and saving 
performance.

Model space is typically scaled down in viewports and displayed in the paper 
space of layouts. Most of the drawing you will do in AutoCAD will be in model 
space. A drawing can have only one model space, whereas any number of layouts 
displaying model space through viewports can be saved in the same file.
Exercise 1.3: Control the AutoCAD Ribbon
AutoCAD has so many palettes and ribbon controls that finding the right tool 
for the job can seem like a job in itself. The ribbon is therefore an important fea-
ture that was introduced to AutoCAD 2010. Autodesk adopted Microsoft’s ribbon 
standard to organize the ever-increasing number of toolbars in a single palette, 
making tools much easier to find. Now let’s explore the various ribbon modes 
and identify the user interface elements of each mode (see Figure 1.10).

Workspaces
Workspaces (not to be confused with drawing spaces) are stored sets of user inter-
face controls, which include floating palettes and the configuration of the ribbon. 
People use workspaces to configure the interface quickly for the task at hand.
	
2.	 Click the Minimize Ribbon button and observe that the full ribbon 
changes to display tabs and panel buttons (see Figure 1.11). Hover the 
cursor over the panel buttons. The buttons expand to reveal all the 
tools shown on the full ribbon.

the tabs doesn’t have any effect. Click the Home tab to reveal the 
full panel temporarily. It disappears after you move the cursor 
away.
	
5.	 Verify that Cycle Through All is selected in the Minimize Ribbon but-
ton’s menu and then click the Minimize Ribbon button one last time. 
The full ribbon interface is restored.
	
6.	 Click the Edit button at the bottom of the Edit panel to reveal addi-
tional tools. Hover the mouse over one of the tools to display a tooltip 
that identifies the tool and describes its function. Holding the cursor 
a while longer reveals an image that illustrates what the tool does 
(see Figure 1.12).
	
7.	 Observe that the bottom of the tooltip shown in Figure 1.12 reveals 
the command name (SOLIDEDIT in this case). The ribbon, menus, 
toolbars, and palettes are all graphical alternatives to typing 
commands.
	
8.	 Press and release the Alt key. Keytips appear on the ribbon (see 
Figure 1.13). Pressing any of the letter combinations activates that 
part of the GUI. Type IN and observe that the Insert tab is selected

Set Drawing Units
Before you start drawing, it’s important to decide what one drawing unit rep-
resents in the real world. Architects in the United States typically equate one 
drawing unit with 1 inch in AutoCAD. You need to choose a unit type that 
matches your country’s industry standard.
Architectural    Most American architects will choose this type, which dis-
plays units in feet and inches. For example, 12', 6 ½" is typed as 12'6-1/2. The 
hyphen is used to separate inches from fractions of an inch rather than feet 
from inches.
Decimal    Metric users should select this type. One decimal unit can be equal 
to 1 millimeter, 1 centimeter, or any metric unit that you decide.
Engineering    Like the Architectural type, engineering units feature feet and 
inches, but the inches are represented in decimal form—for example, 126.500 
feet.
Fractional    American woodworkers often prefer to set AutoCAD drawings in 
fractional units of inches because that is how their work is normally reckoned. 
For example, 12', 6 ½" reads 150- ½" in fractional units.
Scientific    In scientific units, 12.000E+06 is broken down into two parts: 
12.000 indicates 12 accurate to a precision of three decimal places, and E+06 
indicates the exponential function raised to the sixth power, or 10 × 10 × 10 × 
10 × 10 × 10, bringing the total in this example up to 12 million.

Chapter 2
Gaining Basic 
Drawing Skills
This chapter teaches you how to draw basic shapes, such as lines, rect-
angles, circles, arcs, and polygons. You will learn how to correct mistakes, 
navigate two-dimensional space, and use coordinate systems to draw accu-
rately. In addition, you’ll perform your first editing tasks by joining existing 
lines in straight, rounded, or angled intersections.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Navigate 2D drawings
▶
▶Draw lines and rectangles
▶
▶Cancel, erase, and undo
▶
▶Use coordinate systems
▶
▶Draw circles, arcs, and polygons
▶
▶Use Fillet and Chamfer
Navigate 2D Drawings
Unlike in image-editing programs where zooming in results in blurry, pix-
elated images, you can zoom in forever in the AutoCAD® program without 
suffering any loss of quality. However, to avoid getting lost in space, you’ll 
need to learn how to navigate with a variety of pan and zoom tools that 
you’ll explore here.

Command-Line Options
Most commands have options appearing on the command line when they are 
invoked. You can choose an option by typing its blue letter and pressing Enter, 
by clicking the highlighted option on the command line itself, or by pressing 
the down-arrow key and selecting the option from a dynamic input menu in 
the drawing window.
The default option is indicated in angled brackets, which in the case of the ZOOM 
command is real time. You initiate the default option by either clicking 
Enter or pressing the spacebar.
	
11.	 To see everything that has been drawn, you can use the Extents 
option of the ZOOM command or, better yet, use this special shortcut: 
Double-click the mouse wheel. Position the cursor over the bath-
room sink and roll the mouse wheel forward to zoom in. Notice that 
the view stays centered on the sink without your having to pan (see 
Figure 2.5). Drag the mouse wheel to make slight panning adjust-
ments if necessary to center the target object onscreen.

Draw Lines and Rectangles
The drawing commands you’ll probably use the most in AutoCAD are LINE and 
RECTANGLE. You will begin by drawing some lines and rectangles without wor-
rying yet about entering measurements.
Exercise 2.2: Draw Lines
Lines are the backbone of AutoCAD. Let’s begin drawing lines. To start, open the 
file Ex02.2-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Press Z and Enter twice to accept the command’s default option. Position 
the cursor over the lower-right portion of the floor plan and drag upward 
to zoom so that the empty space of the living room fills the canvas.
	
2.	 Turn off all status toggles in the application status bar if they are 
not off already. Status toggles are highlighted in blue when they 
are on and appear in gray when they are off (see Figure 2.6). The 
exception to this rule is Graphics Performance, which is always blue 
if your graphics card’s hardware acceleration is active. Open the 
Customization menu (last icon on the right) and toggle off Graphics 
Performance.

Exercise 2.3: Draw Rectangles
Line segments are treated as individual objects, whereas the four line segments 
comprising a rectangle are treated as a single entity. Although rectangles can 
obviously be drawn with the LINE command, specialized commands such as 
RECTANG are more efficient for constructing specific shapes, and they offer more 
options. Let’s experiment now with this feature. To begin, open the file Ex02 
.3-start.dwg from the Chapter 2 companion files.
	
1.	 Click the Rectangle tool in the Draw panel and then click two oppo-
site corner points on the canvas. Unlike the LINE command, this 
command automatically terminates when the rectangle is drawn.
	
2.	 Press Enter to repeat the last command. This time pay attention to 
the prompts in the Command window.
RECTANG Specify first corner point or
[Chamfer Elevation Fillet Thickness Width]:
You have the opportunity to use any of the options listed in 
the square brackets before you even begin drawing the rectangle. 
However, in this case you will use the default option, which comes 
before the word or.
	
3.	 Click the first corner point in the document window. A new prompt 
appears.
RECTANG Specify other corner point or
[Area Dimensions Rotation]:
At this point a new command prompt shows another default option 
before the word or, as well as a few options in square brackets. You 
will again take the default option in this prompt, which is to specify 
the other corner point.
	
4.	 Click the other corner point, and the rectangle is drawn. In addition, 
the command is automatically terminated.
	
5.	 Type REC (for RECTANG) and press the spacebar. Type F and press 
Enter to execute the Fillet option. The command prompt reads as 
follows:
Specify fillet radius for rectangles <0'-0" >:
	
6.	 Type 2 (or 5 for metric) and press Enter.

Use Coordinate Systems
AutoCAD uses the same Euclidean space you learned about in geometry class, but 
don’t panic—I don’t expect you to remember any theorems! You can draw objects in 
Euclidean space using the following coordinate systems: Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, 
and spherical. (The last two are rarely used, so they won’t be covered in this book.)
Cartesian coordinates are useful for drawing rectangles with specific length 
and width measurements. Polar coordinates are used most often for drawing 
lines with specific lengths and angles, with respect to horizontal. Once you 
learn coordinate system syntax, you can use the systems interchangeably to 
draw accurately in any context.
In the Cartesian system, every point is defined by three values, expressed in 
terms of distances along the x-, y-, and z-axes. In two-dimensional drawings, 
the z-coordinate value of all objects is 0, so objects are expressed solely in terms 
of x- and y-coordinates (see Figure 2.12).

Exercise 2.5: Use Absolute Coordinates
Coordinates can be absolute or relative, no matter which coordinate system is 
used. Let’s first focus on drawing a line using absolute coordinates. To begin, 
open the file Ex02.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Draw panel. The prompt in the Command 
window reads as follows:
LINE Specify first point:
Type 0,0 and press Enter. The origin point of Euclidean space has 
coordinates 0 in x and 0 in y, which is written as 0,0.

2.	 Now the prompt in the Command window reads as follows:
LINE Specify next point or [Undo]:
Type 3',0 (or 90,0 for metric) and press Enter. Right-click to finish 
the LINE command.
	
3.	 Save your work. Your model should now resemble Ex02.5-end.dwg, 
which is available among this chapter’s companion files.
Exercise 2.6: Use Relative Coordinates
Calculating where every object is in relation to the origin point (which is 
what absolute coordinates require) would be far too cumbersome in practice. 
Therefore, relative coordinates are used more frequently. Let’s explore how to 
use them. To begin, open the file Ex02.6-start.dwg from this chapter’s com-
panion files.
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Draw panel. Click an arbitrary point in the 
middle of the living room. The coordinates of the point you clicked 
are unknown; thankfully, with relative coordinates you won’t ever 
need to find out what they are.
	
2.	 Type @3',0 (or @90,0 for metric) and press Enter twice.
	
3.	 Press Enter to repeat the last command. You’ll see this prompt:
LINE Specify first point:
	
4.	 Right-click in the drawing canvas and hold (for longer than 250 mil-
liseconds) to open the context menu. Select the first coordinate value 
from the Recent Input menu (see Figure 2.13).

6.	 Type @-3',0 (or @-90,0 for metric) and press Enter. Type @0,-6' (or 
@0,-180 for metric) and press Enter twice to complete a rectangle.
	
7.	 Click the Rectangle tool on the Draw panel and then click an arbi-
trary point at the bottom of the living room. The prompt reads as 
follows:
RECTANG Specify other corner point or
[Area Dimensions Rotation]:
	
8.	 Type @3',6' (or @90,180 for metric) and press Enter. The same rect-
angle that you more laboriously drew with lines is already done.
	
9.	 Save your work. Your model should now resemble Ex02.6-end.dwg, 
which is available among this chapter’s companion files.
Exercise 2.7: Use Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates are another useful way of measuring Euclidean space. In polar 
coordinates, points are located using two measurements: the distance from 
the origin point and the angle from zero degrees (see Figure 2.14). East is the 
default direction of zero degrees.
F i g u r e   2 . 1 4   Polar coordinates

Let’s explore how to use polar coordinates. To begin, open the file Ex02 
.7-start.dwg from the Chapter 2 companion files.
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Draw panel. Click an arbitrary first point in 
the living room; then type @3'<45 (or @90<45 for metric) and press 
Enter to end the LINE command.
◀
By default, zero 
degrees is toward the 
east or right side of the 
canvas. In addition, 
positive angles are 
typically measured 
counterclockwise from 
east. These defaults 
can be set in the 
UNITS command.
The < or less than 
symbol (hold Shift and 
press the comma key) 
represents angular 
measure in AutoCAD. 
Think of the < symbol 
as a graphic represen-
tation of an angle.
◀
◀
It is very efficient to 
use RECTANG with 
Cartesian coordinates.

2.	 Press Enter to repeat the last command. Click an arbitrary first point, 
move the cursor up and to the left, type 3' (or 90 for metric), and press 
Enter twice. A 3' (or 90 for metric) line is drawn at an arbitrary angle.
Specifying Angles with the Cursor
Direct distance entry is the relative coordinate method of using the cursor to 
determine an angle, rather than typing in a specific number of degrees follow-
ing the < symbol. Direct distance entry is most efficiently used with Ortho and  
Polar modes, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 3, “Using Drawing Aids.”
	
3.	 Press L and then press the spacebar. Click an arbitrary first point, 
type @4'<180 (or @120<180 for metric), and press Enter. The line is 
drawn to the left from the first point because 180 degrees is the same 
direction as angle zero but leads in the opposite direction.
	
4.	 Type @3'<–90 (or @90<–90 for metric) and press Enter. Negative 
angles are measured clockwise from angle zero by default. Press C 
and then Enter to close the 3:4:5 triangle you’ve just drawn.
	
5.	 Type UCSICON and press Enter. UCS stands for user coordinate  
system. You, the user, can change the coordinate system’s orienta-
tion. Type on and press Enter. An icon indicating the directions of 
the positive x- and y-axes is displayed in the lower-left corner of the 
canvas (see Figure 2.15).

Rotating the Plan to Match the UCS
User coordinate systems are usually associated with 3D modeling, but there is 
one transformation especially useful for 2D drafting: rotation around the z-axis. 
If you are drawing a building wing or mechanical part that is at an angle with 
respect to the horizontal plane (especially when the angle isn’t an increment 
of 90 degrees), try rotating the UCS’s z-axis and then use the PLAN command 
to reorient the drawing to the new horizontal.
	
9.	 Click the Line tool on the Draw panel. Click an arbitrary first point 
in the living room, type @3'<45 (or @90<45 for metric), and press 
Enter twice to end the LINE command. The new line has a different 
orientation with respect to the original line you drew in step 1 (see 
Figure 2.18).

Draw Circles, Arcs, and Polygons
Arcs are sections of circles. Polygons are regular figures made of straight seg-
ments such as a triangle, square, pentagon, or hexagon. A polygon with a large 
number of segments may look like a circle but is fundamentally different.
There are many options for creating circles, arcs, and polygons. AutoCAD pro-
vides these options to make it easier to create accurate shapes based on all the 
types of geometric situations that typically arise in drawings.
Exercise 2.8: Create Circles
Let’s draw some circles on the kitchen stove to represent the burners. To begin, 
open the file Ex02.8-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Zoom into the stove in the kitchen. Two of the burner circles are 
missing, and you will draw them.
	
2.	 On the Home tab, take a look at the Layer drop-down menu in the 
Layers panel and observe that Furniture is the current layer (because 
you see its name without having to open the drop-down). Open the 
Layer drop-down menu and select Equipment as the current layer 
(see Figure 2.19).
Drawn objects appear 
on whichever layer is 
current. Think of layers 
as invisible sheets of 
tracing paper that you 
draw on. You’ll learn 
more about layers in 
Chapter 6, “Controlling 
Object Visibility and 
Appearance.”

reads as follows:
CIRCLE Specify radius of circle or [Diameter] <0f-0g>:
Type 3 (or 8 for metric) and press Enter to create a circle with a 
radius of 3" (or 8 for metric).
	
6.	 Right-click to repeat the last command. The prompt in the Command 
window reads as follows:
CIRCLE Specify center point for circle or
[3P 2P Ttr (tan tan radius)]:
Type 2P to indicate the two-point option and press Enter. Hold 
down Shift and right-click to open the Object Snap context menu. 
Select Node and then click point B (shown in Figure 2.22).
	
7.	 Hold Shift again, right-click, and choose Node. Click point C (shown 
in Figure 2.22), and the CIRCLE command is completed.

Controlling Arc and Circle Smoothness
Arcs and circles are defined with perfect curvature in AutoCAD, but sometimes 
they appear blocky on the screen. The system variable VIEWRES controls how 
smoothly arcs and circles are drawn onscreen. Adjust this on the View tab under 
the Visual Style panel’s expansion menu. Set the resolution to the maximum 
VIEWRES value by typing VIEWRES, pressing Enter twice, typing 20000, and 
pressing Enter again. Type REGEN and press Enter to make this change take 
effect on the screen.

Use Fillet and Chamfer
Fillet and Chamfer are tools that create transitions between objects. Fillet cre-
ates arcs, and Chamfer creates lines. Fillet is most commonly used for a purpose 
for which it probably wasn’t designed—joining separate lines so that they inter-
sect at their endpoints, without creating arcs at all.
Exercise 2.11: Join Nonparallel Lines
Fillet and Chamfer can be used to join lines that are crossing as well as lines 
that don’t meet. Chamfer doesn’t work on parallel lines at all, but Fillet will cre-
ate a half-circle connecting the endpoints of parallel lines, regardless of the fillet 
radius. Let’s explore the FILLET and CHAMFER commands. To begin, open the 
file Ex02.11-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Position the cursor on the canvas and type CHA (for CHAMFER) 
or select Chamfer under the Fillet icon in the Modify panel. Press 
Enter and then press the down-arrow key to expand the command’s 
options.
	
2.	 Press the down-arrow key three more times and press Enter to select 
the Distance option in the Dynamic Input display (see Figure 2.26).

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to pan and zoom around 2D drawings and draw lines, rect-
angles, circles, arcs, and polygons. You have filleted and chamfered sets of lines, used absolute 
and relative coordinate systems, and created objects using specific measurements. In addition, 
you now know how to cancel, erase, and undo, as well as how to correct your mistakes.

Using Drawing Aids
The drawing aids in the AutoCAD® program are like the triangles, com-
passes, and engineering scales of traditional drafting. Drawing aids are 
essential modes and methods of entering data that, once mastered, allow you 
to create measured drawings with ease. I highly recommend learning all of 
the drawing aids because they will make you a more productive draftsper-
son. Most drawing aids can be toggled on or off from the application status 
bar. Additional settings and dialog boxes are accessible by right-clicking the 
individual status bar toggles.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Use Grid and Snap
▶
▶Employ Ortho and Polar Tracking
▶
▶Use PolarSnap
▶
▶Select running object snaps
▶
▶Harness the From snap
▶
▶Apply object snap tracking
Use Grid and Snap
The most basic drawing aid, Grid, makes the canvas in AutoCAD look like 
graph paper. You can adjust the grid’s measured size and the spacing of its 
major lines to simulate many types of graph paper.
Snap constrains your ability to draw objects so that they automatically 
start and end precisely at grid intersections. Grid and Snap are most help-
ful when used together so that you can draw objects that snap to the grid. 
Figure 3.1 shows some of the status bar toggles you’ll be learning about in 
this chapter.

Annotation Visibility, Autoscale, and Annotation Scale. Click in the 
drawing window to close the Customization menu. Change Units to 
Architectural if you are using Imperial units; leave Decimal selected 
if you are using metric units.
	
4.	 Type DS and press Enter to open the Drafting Settings dialog box. 
Change Grid X spacing to 1" (or 10 for metric) and press Tab; Grid Y 
spacing updates with the same value. Set Major Line Every to 12 for 
Imperial (or 10 for metric) so that you’ll see darker grid lines every 
foot. Notice that Snap spacing is set to 1/2" (or 10 mm) by default. 
Select Snap On and verify that the Grid Snap and Rectangular Snap 
radio buttons are selected in the Snap Type area (see Figure 3.2). 
Click OK.
	
5.	 Click the Line tool in the Draw panel on the ribbon’s Home tab. Click 
the first point close to the origin point of the UCS icon, located in the 
lower-left corner of the drawing window. Click the second point, 2' (or 
600 in metric) above the first point, by clicking the second intersec-
tion (or sixth intersection in metric) of major grid lines. Right-click 
to end the LINE command.

Transparent Commands
Status bar buttons can be toggled on or off and their settings adjusted while 
another command is running. Commands that operate while another command 
is running are called transparent commands. Typing an apostrophe before a 
command forces it to be run transparently. For example, while drawing a line, 
type 'Z and press Enter. The ZOOM command is run transparently, and when 
it is done, the LINE command resumes. The following transcript shows this 
command sequence:

Employ Ortho and Polar Tracking 
Ortho mode aids in drawing orthogonal (horizontal or vertical) lines. Polar 
Tracking is more flexible than Ortho mode, with the ability to constrain lines 
to increments of a set angle. A list of common angles—45, 90, 135, 180, and 
so on—is included on Polar Tracking’s context menu. The traditional square 
and a set of triangles from traditional drafting are analogs to Ortho and Polar 
Tracking modes in AutoCAD.
Exercise 3.2: Draw with Ortho and 
Polar Tracking
Let’s try Ortho and Polar Tracking modes by drawing a series of line segments. 
You’ll use Ortho when the segments are 90° apart and Polar Tracking when the 
segments are drawn at other angles. Begin by opening the file Ex03.2-start.dwg 
from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Type L, position the cursor over the right endpoint of the horizontal 
line, and click to establish the first point of a new line.
	
2.	 Toggle off Snap mode by pressing the F9 key.
	
3.	 Toggle on Ortho mode by clicking the Ortho toggle in the status bar 
or by pressing the F8 key.
	
4.	 Move the cursor down from the last point, type 10-3/4" (or 240 for 
metric), and press Enter. Ortho mode constrains the line vertically, 
and typing in an explicit value obviates the need for Snap.
	
5.	 Toggle off Ortho mode by clicking its status bar button. Toggle on 
Polar Tracking by clicking the adjacent button on the right. Right-
click the Polar Tracking button, and choose 45°, 90°, 135°, 180° from 
the context menu.

When Polar Tracking is

6.	 Move the cursor around and observe that green dashed lines appear 
in eight locations around a circle (in 45° increments). Move the cur-
sor to the right relative to the last point, type 2' (or 600 for metric), 
and press Enter (see Figure 3.5). Press Esc to terminate the LINE 
command without deleting the last segment drawn.

7.	 Save your work.
Your model should now resemble Ex03.2-end.dwg, which is available among

Just like Ortho mode, Polar Tracking guarantees that the last line drawn was 
perfectly aligned to the set increment; you merely had to move the cursor in the 
general direction you wanted to direct the new line. Ortho and Polar Tracking 
save you from having to type in angles or coordinate values explicitly or to even 
think about coordinate systems.
Use PolarSnap
PolarSnap includes a kind of snap that is customized for Polar Tracking. Instead 
of being tied to a spatial grid (as with Snap), PolarSnap is based on relative polar 
coordinates.

box. Type 1" (or 10 for metric) in the Polar Distance text box (this 
­dialog was shown in Figure 3.2). Click OK.
	
3.	 Type L and press Enter. Type 4',1'1-1/4 (or 1200,360 for metric) and 
press Enter to input the absolute coordinates of the end of the lower 
horizontal line.

Select Running Object Snaps
The lines you have drawn thus far are all precisely connected because they were 
chained together as they were drawn or their coordinates were known. Aside 
from these special circumstances, lines must be connected using object snaps to 
ensure accuracy.
You learned to use the Object Snap context menu in Chapter 2, “Gaining 
Basic Drawing Skills,” and now you will use that as a jumping-off point to learn 
a far more efficient method called running object snap.
Exercise 3.4: Draw with Running  
Object Snaps
As you will see in the steps that follow, with running object snaps, frequently 
used object snaps can be turned on continuously. That way, you don’t have to 
invoke them explicitly every time you want to use object snaps. Begin by open-
ing the file Ex03.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Using Polar Tracking, but without invoking Snap or Object Snap, 
draw a line using points A to B in Figure 3.9 as a guide. Click each

Apply Object Snap Tracking
Object snap tracking is for situations where you want to snap to a point that has 
a geometric relationship with two or more snap points. As you’ll see in the fol-
lowing steps, using object snap tracking saves time when compared with draw-
ing temporary construction lines that must later be deleted.
Exercise 3.6: Use Object Snap Tracking
Begin by opening the file Ex03.6-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Click the Circle tool on the Draw panel.
	
2.	 Toggle on Object Snap Tracking by clicking its icon on the status bar. 
Verify that Ortho mode is on. (If it isn’t, press F8.)
	
3.	 Move the cursor over point A in Figure 3.15. When the running mid-
point snap marker appears, move the cursor horizontally to the right 
to establish the first tracking line. Do not click yet.

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to draw with Grid and Snap when your geometry conforms to a 
spatial grid; how to use Ortho and Polar Tracking to draw horizontal, vertical, and angled lines; 
how to use PolarSnap when angled lines are measured in set increments; how to use running 
object snaps to save time connecting objects; how to use the From snap to draw in relation to 
another object; and finally, how to use object snap tracking to snap to points implied by the 
position of other snap points.

Editing Entities
Drawing in the AutoCAD® program is not just about creating lines, 
rectangles, circles, and other shapes. Most of your time will be spent editing 
entities. Although AutoCAD provides the basic tools for transforming shapes 
(such as Move, Copy, Rotate, and Scale), more complex editing tools (such 
as Array, Trim, Extend, Lengthen, Stretch, Offset, Mirror, Break, Join, and 
Overkill) are also available.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Create selection sets
▶
▶Use Move and Copy
▶
▶Use Rotate and Scale
▶
▶Work with arrays
▶
▶Use Trim and Extend
▶
▶Use Lengthen and Stretch
▶
▶Use Offset and Mirror
▶
▶Edit with grips
Create Selection Sets
All editing commands operate on one or more drawing entities. In complex 
drawings, you have to plan how you will select only those entities you want 
to edit while leaving all other entities unaffected. You will learn a number of 
techniques for adding and removing entities from the selection set, which is 
the collection of entities your chosen editing command acts upon.
To edit objects, you must first select them. In complex drawings, selecting 
would be tedious if you had to click one object at a time. In the following exer-
cise, you will learn several efficient selection methods that you can use at any 
Select objects: prompt, which appears in every editing command.

Selecting Similar Objects  (Continued)
Use Move and Copy
MOVE and COPY are the most commonly used commands in AutoCAD. As you’ll 
see in the following steps, they are similar in that they require both a distance 
and a direction to indicate where you plan to displace the selected objects.
Exercise 4.3: Move and Copy
Begin by opening the file Ex04.3-start.dwg.
	
1.	 Pan to the upper-right quadrant of the building and zoom into the 
furniture grouping that needs to be filled in.
	
2.	 Click the chair that is not in front of a desk to select it. Position the 
cursor over the selected chair but not over its grip. Drag the chair 
while holding down the left mouse button to move it closer to the 
upper desk; see Figure 4.10.
	
3.	 To position the chair more precisely, click the Move tool on the 
Modify panel. Select the chair you just moved in the previous step 
and press Enter. The command prompt reads as follows:
MOVE Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
The disadvantages to 
moving by dragging 
are that the displace-
ment is unmeasured,

Use Rotate and Scale
The ROTATE and SCALE commands are obviously essential to drawing; each 
requires a base point to indicate the center from which objects are transformed. 
Numerically speaking, you typically rotate by degrees or scale by percentages 
about base points. On the other hand, you can avoid using numbers entirely by 
choosing the Reference options, which let you rotate or scale selection sets in 
relation to other objects.
Exercise 4.4: Rotate and Scale
Begin by opening the file Ex04.4-start.dwg.

ROTATE Specify rotation angle or [Copy Reference] <0.00>:
Type R (for Reference) and press Enter. Instead of specifying the 
reference angle with a number, you will determine the angle interac-
tively. Type @ and press Enter to input the base point of the rotation 
as the base point of the reference angle.

Divide and Measure
The DIVIDE and MEASURE commands do not copy objects in a rectangular 
grid or around a center point as does the ARRAY command. Instead, these com-
mands are used for arraying points. DIVIDE splits up a path into any number of 
evenly spaced points. MEASURE lays out points at a set distance, often leaving a 
remainder at the end of a path. You’ll use DIVIDE in Chapter 5, “Shaping Curves.”
Use Trim and Extend
The TRIM and EXTEND commands are opposites. You can invoke the opposite 
command while running either by holding down Shift. This method is especially 
helpful because TRIM and EXTEND are often used together.

Use Offset and Mirror
The OFFSET and MIRROR commands are often used to create new objects. 
OFFSET creates an object a set distance on one side of the original object. 
MIRROR creates a reversed object at a distance from the original object as deter-
mined by the position of a drawn reflection line.
Exercise 4.9: Offset and Mirror

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to use many different editing tools, including Move, Copy, 
Rotate, Scale, Array, Trim, Extend, Lengthen, Stretch, Offset, and Mirror. You learned several 
methods for selecting objects so they can be edited with these commands. In addition, you 
learned how to edit objects directly, without issuing commands, by editing with grips.

Chapter 5
Shaping Curves
From the simplest polyline that includes straight and curving arc seg-
ments to more complexly curving ellipses and splines, you can shape curves 
to suit any geometric situation in the AutoCAD® program. Spline objects 
offer the most flexibility, allowing you to shape them using fit points or 
control vertices. You can also create splines that seamlessly blend between 
existing straight or curved objects while maintaining smooth or tangent 
continuity.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Draw and edit curved polylines
▶
▶Draw ellipses
▶
▶Shape splines
▶
▶Blend between objects with splines
Draw and Edit Curved Polylines
The simplest curved objects are circles and arcs (which are just parts of 
circles) because they curve with a constant radius from a center point. In 
the following steps, you will chain a series of arcs and/or lines together in a 
single polyline object, which not only streamlines editing and selection, but 
also ensures smooth curvature between adjacent arcs.
Exercise 5.1: Draw and Edit Curved Polylines
Begin by opening the file Ex05.1-start.dwg from this chapter’s compan-
ion files, available for download from the book’s web page at www.sybex 
.com/go/autocad2018essentials. Figure 5.1 shows the landscape plan.

Should You Use JOIN or PEDIT?
In AutoCAD 2013 and earlier, objects had to be converted into polylines and then 
joined using the polyline editing command called PEDIT. The streamlined 
JOIN command makes the older workflow unnecessary. Use it on lines, 2D and 
3D polylines, arcs, elliptical arcs (sections of ellipses), and/or helices. Multiple 
object types can be joined at once. The resulting object type depends on what 
was selected.
Draw Ellipses
AutoCAD can draw perfect ovals, which are mathematically known as ellipses. 
Instead of stretching a cord from two pins to a moving pencil point (which is 
how you draw an ellipse by hand), in AutoCAD you specify the lengths of its 
major and minor axes (see Figure 5.9).

Shape Splines
Splines are the equivalent of a French curve in traditional drafting, used 
for making curves of constantly changing radii. The splines in AutoCAD 
are NURBS-based curves (the same type used in Autodesk® Alias® Design,

You’ll learn more about 
blocks in Chapter 7, 
“Organizing Objects.”

C h ap t e r  5 • S h ap i n g  Cu r ve s 	   
Autodesk® Maya®, Autodesk® 3ds Max®, and many other high-end 3D pro-
grams). There are two types of NURBS curves:
▶
▶Those defined by control vertices (CVs), which don’t lie on the curve 
except at its start and endpoints
▶
▶Those defined by fit points, which lie on the curve itself
You have more control over shaping curves with CVs, but if you want the 
curve to pass through specific points or want the curve to have sharp kinks, 
then Fit Points mode is preferable. Fortunately, it is easy to switch between 
CVs and Fit Points editing modes, so you can make up your mind about which 
method to use to suit the situation.
Exercise 5.3: Work with Control Vertices
CVs offer the most flexibility in terms of precisely shaping NURBS curves. A 
control frame connects CVs and represents the maximum possible curvature 
between adjacent CVs.
You will now draw a CV spline around the lake. Begin by opening  
Ex05.3-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Toggle off Ortho, Polar Tracking, Object Snap Tracking, and 
Object Snap modes on the status bar if any of them are on. Type 
SPL (for Spline) and press Enter. The command prompt reads as 
follows:
Current settings: Method=Fit Knots=Chord
SPLINE Specify first point or [Method Knots Object]:
Click Method on the command line.
	
2.	 The command prompt reads as follows:
SPLINE Enter spline creation method [Fit CV] <Fit>:
Click CV on the command line. Click the first point anywhere along 
the edge of the lake.
	
3.	 Continue clicking points all the way around the lake. When you get 
close to the first point, type C (for Close) and press Enter. Click the 
spline you just drew to reveal its CVs (see Figure 5.12).
Certiﬁcation
Objective
CV curves are typically 
roughed in initially 
and then are refined 
in shape immediately 
afterward.

6.	 Refining a vertex transforms one vertex into two adjacent vertices. Try 
refining vertices in areas where the curvature is changing rapidly.
	
7.	 Another way to affect the shape of a spline is to adjust the weights 
of individual CVs. Double-click the spline itself (rather than a CV or 
the control frame) to invoke the SPLINEDIT command. The prompt 
reads as follows:
SPLINEDIT Enter an option [Open Fit data Edit vertex

Click Edit Vertex on the command line.
	
8.	 The prompt now reads as follows:
SPLINEDIT Enter a vertex editing option [Add Delete 
Elevate order

Type W (for Weight) and press Enter.
	
9.	 Before entering a weight value, you must select the vertex in which 
you’re interested. Zoom out until you can see all the vertices, locate the 
red one, press Enter repeatedly to choose the default option (Next), and 
move the red CV one position at a time until your chosen CV turns red.
	
10.	 Type 2 and press Enter (see Figure 5.14). The spline will get closer to 
the red CV and its control frame. Type .5 and press Enter again; the 
curve moves farther away from the control frame. Type a value appro-
priate to your particular situation and press Enter. You’re setting a 
weight of 0.75 for the CV shown in Figure 5.14 to push it away from 
the control frame and more closely match the shape of the lake.
▶
Vertices with higher 
weights pull the curve 
toward the control 
frame, and vertices 
with weights below 1 
(but above 0) push the 
spline farther away.

the lake.
	
13.	 Type IM (for Image) and press Enter. The External References palette 
appears.
	
14.	 Right-click Pond in the External References palette and choose Detach. 
Close the External References palette. Select the pond spline and 
change its color to Blue in the Properties panel. The pond is now repre-
sented by a blue curve rather than a blue image (see Figure 5.15).

use with a mouse, so if you have a stylus and a drawing tablet, try using them for 
a more natural drawing feel. Unfortunately, sketching splines usually results in 
an uneven distribution of CVs, but this can be rectified by using CVREBUILD. 
The CVREBUILD command’s Rebuild Curve dialog box is shown here:
Exercise 5.4: Work with Fit Points
Fit-point splines are straightforward in the sense that the fit points you click 
lie on (or very close to) the curve itself. Controlling the shape of a fit curve on 
the most basic level is a matter of adding more fit points in strategic locations. 
There are a few advanced options affecting the shape of a spline in between fit 
points (Tangent, Tolerance, Kink, and Knot Parameterization), and you will use 
Kink in this exercise to establish sharp points on the spline. Begin by opening 
the file Ex05.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Zoom into the area at the bottom of the lake. More specifically, 
zoom into the grouping of five points. Type REGEN and press Enter 
to regenerate the display and thus automatically resize the point 
objects.
	
2.	 Expand the Draw panel and click the Spline Fit tool at the top left. 
Toggle on Object Snap mode in the status bar (with Node snap on) 
and click the top point, the point on the right, the point on the bot-
tom, and then the one on the left. Type C (for Close) and press Enter. 
The fit curve looks very much like a circle, although it is not perfectly 
round (see Figure 5.16). This will be the start of an abstract tree 
representation.

SPLINEDIT Specify existing fit point on spline <exit>:
Click the top point.

This particular command requires that you snap the new fit point,  
so type NEA (for Nearest), and press Enter. Click the curve in between 
the top and right points. Press Enter four times to exit SPLINEDIT 
fully.
	
6.	 Another way to add fit points is with the multifunction grips, 
although this method doesn’t work on the first point. To use this fea-
ture, click the spline to select it, hover the cursor over the rightmost 
point, and choose Add Fit Point from the menu that appears. Hold 
Shift, right-click, and choose Nearest from the context menu. Click a

Blend Between Objects with Splines
The BLEND command creates a CV spline in between two selected lines, 
circular or elliptical arcs, splines, or any combination of these object types. 
Blend curves join the endpoints of the two objects with a curve having 
either tangent or smooth continuity. A subtle difference exists between these 
types of blending.
A blend curve with tangent continuity has its control frame parallel to 
the control frame of the adjacent curve. Not only does a blend curve with 
smooth continuity have its control frame parallel to the control frame of the 
adjacent curve, but the control frames have equal lengths. In simpler terms, 
tangent continuity is smooth, and smooth continuity is “perfectly smooth.”

Controlling Object 
Visibility and 
Appearance
Layers control whether objects are visible or hidden. All objects have 
properties that control their appearance—color, linetype, lineweight, and so 
on. The layers to which objects are assigned usually control general object 
properties, but these properties can be set on a per-object basis as well. This 
chapter explores the many AutoCAD® tools associated with layers, illustrat-
ing their importance in managing the complexity of design.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Change object properties
▶
▶Set the current layer
▶
▶Alter the layer assignments of objects
▶
▶Control layer visibility
▶
▶Apply linetype
▶
▶Assign properties by object or by layer
▶
▶Manage layer properties
▶
▶Isolate objects
Change Object Properties
All objects have properties controlling their appearance. When you draw a 
line, you are ultimately specifying its geometric properties (the start point 
and the endpoint). Likewise, when you draw a circle, you are just specifying 
its center point and radius properties. Geometric properties are the most

important factor governing how objects look and determining where the objects 
are in space.
In addition to geometric properties, all objects share a short list of general 
properties: layer, color, linetype, linetype scale, lineweight, transparency, and 
thickness. Although general properties are assigned on a per-object basis, they 
are usually controlled by using layers.

Alter the Layer Assignments of Objects
Although you have already changed the layer assignments of objects using 
Quick Properties, there are more efficient methods, some of which do not 
require you to remember a layer name.
Exercise 6.3: Assign Layers
Let’s explore several methods for changing the layer assignments of existing 
objects. Begin by opening the file Ex06.3-start.dwg from this chapter’s com-
panion files.
	
1.	 Type DS and press Enter. Select the Quick Properties tab of the 
Drafting Settings dialog box and uncheck Display The Quick 
Properties Palette On Selection (see Figure 6.9). Click OK.

2.	 Select the coffee table in Marketing. Select the Home tab on the 
ribbon. Notice that the entry in the Layer drop-down in the Layers 
panel changes to layer 0; this does not mean that layer 0 is current 
(Millwork is), only that the selected item is on layer 0.

5.	 Click the Match tool in the Layers panel, select the coffee table in the 
lounge, and press Enter. The command prompt reads as follows:
LAYMCH Select object on destination layer or [Name]:
	
6.	 Click one of the sofas in the lounge and press Enter; the LAYMCH 
command ends. The coffee table is now assigned to the same layer as 
the sofas (Furniture).
	
7.	 Pan to the manager’s office.

In AutoCAD 2018, you 
can optionally add the 
Layer drop-down list 
to the Quick Properties 
toolbar.

Merging Layers
You can merge the contents of multiple layers into a single layer. First, select 
the layers you want to merge in the Layer Properties Manager (using the Ctrl key 
to select multiple nonsequential layers), right-click, and select Merge Selected 
Layers To. You are then presented with a dialog box where you can select the 
single destination layer from a list. The source layers are automatically purged 
after their contents are merged into the destination layer.

Control Layer Visibility
In traditional drafting, separate drawings would have to be made for the floor 
plan and the reflected ceiling plan to represent the floor and ceiling of the same 
space. In AutoCAD, simply displaying some layers while hiding others allows you 
to create some of the drawings required to describe the space graphically.
To understand better how to do this, you need to learn how to toggle layer sta-
tus, isolate layers to work without distraction, and save layer states to recall the 
layer status of multiple layers quickly.
Exercise 6.4: Toggle Layer Status
In addition to having properties such as color, linetype, lineweight, and so on, 
layers have states that can be toggled, including On/Off, Thaw/Freeze, and 
Lock/Unlock. As you’ll see in the following steps, layer states control the vis-
ibility and editability of the objects assigned to layers. Begin by opening the file 
Ex06.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Expand the Layers panel and click the Turn All Layers On tool. You 
now see the switches ($ symbols), downlights, and header layers. 
Figure 6.12 shows the result.

2.	 Open the Layer drop-down menu in the Layers panel and click the 
Appliance layer’s lightbulb icon to toggle it off. Toggle off the Desk 
layer as well. Click outside the Layer drop-down menu to close it.
	
3.	 Click the Off tool in the Layers panel and click the following objects: 
furniture, sink, door, toilet, plant, stairs, low wall, low wall’s pattern 
fill, text, reception desk, and the porch. Click a kitchen cabinet, and 
the command prompt reads as follows:
LAYOFF Layer "Millwork" is current, do you want to
turn it off? [Yes/No] <No>:
	
4.	 Choose Yes from the dynamic prompt. Press Esc to end the LAYOFF 
command. Figure 6.13 shows the result.

If you turn the current 
layer off, then anything 
you draw subsequently 
will be hidden.

Exercise 6.5: Isolate Layers
You can quickly isolate one or more layers to work on them without the visual 
clutter of all the other layers. Begin by opening the file Ex06.5-start.dwg 
from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Click the Isolate tool on the Layers panel and then make a crossing 
selection through one of the windows. Press Enter, and all the other 
layers disappear (see Figure 6.14).

Exercise 6.6: Save Layer States
In this section, you will learn how to save collections of layer states for later 
recall. You have already created a reflected ceiling plan in this chapter, and you 
will now save it as a layer state so that you won’t have to repeat all the work of 
toggling layer states in the future. Begin by opening the file Ex06.6-start.dwg 
from this chapter’s companion files.

Apply Linetype
In traditional drafting, you draw short, interrupted line segments when you 
want to indicate a hidden line. Hidden lines represent objects that are above the 
section plane. For example, objects such as upper cabinets, high shelves, or roof 
edges are shown as hidden because they are above an imaginary section line 
cutting the building horizontally.
◀
Switch back to the 
Furniture Plan state, 
and you’ll see the value 
in saving layer states (it 
saves lots of time).
◀
Using LAYERP 
(Layer Previous) 
undoes the last set 
of changes to layers. 
This is different from 
UNDO, which affects 
more than layers.

C h ap t e r  6 • C o nt r o l l i n g  O b j e c t V i s i b i l i t y  a n d A p p e ar a n c e 	   
In AutoCAD, lines are not interrupted (broken into multiple little pieces) to 
indicate hidden lines. Instead, continuous lines are assigned a linetype, and this 
style makes lines appear as if they are interrupted. One advantage to this is that 
you can adjust the scale of the line breaks without having to redraw myriad 
little lines.
Exercise 6.7: Use Linetype
Begin by opening the file Ex06.7-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.

Assign Properties by Object or by Layer
Properties such as color, linetype, and lineweight are typically assigned by layer 
rather than by object. There is a special property value called ByLayer that 
passes control over specific properties to the properties managed by the layer to 
which the objects are assigned. As you’ll see in these steps, using the ByLayer 
property is a lot easier than it sounds.
Exercise 6.8: Assign Properties
Begin by opening the file Ex06.8-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.

panel. Press Ctrl+Shift+P to toggle on Quick Properties if it is 
­currently off.
	
5.	 Select the continuous line drawn in step 2 and change its Linetype 
property to Hidden (see Figure 6.25). Press Esc to deselect.

Isolate Objects
In addition to object properties and layers, AutoCAD has yet another system for 
controlling the visibility of objects that allows you to isolate and/or hide indi-
vidually selected objects. This system works completely independently of object 
and layer properties. It is best to isolate and/or hide objects as a drawing aid to 
reduce visual clutter onscreen while you are working in complex drawings.
Exercise 6.10: Isolate and Hide Individual 
Objects
In this exercise, you will learn how to isolate objects, hide additional objects, 
and finally end the object isolation to return the drawing to its initial state. This 
procedure is useful in situations where you want to focus on a chosen set of 
objects without visual distraction while you perform a task.
Begin by opening the file Ex06.10-start.dwg from this chapter’s compan-
ion files.

Chapter 7
Organizing Objects
The fundamental entities in the AutoCAD® program are lines, polylines, 
circles, arcs, ellipses, and text. By combining these entities into blocks 
and/or groups, you can manipulate more complex objects, such as chairs, 
mechanical assemblies, trees, or any other organizational designation appro-
priate to your industry.
Manipulating blocks is an efficient means of working not only because it 
reduces the number of items requiring selection, but also because blocks 
can potentially control numerous references from a single definition. In this 
chapter, you will learn how groups are a flexible means of organizing collec-
tions of objects, which often include blocks as members. You will also learn 
how to select and manipulate a group as a whole or access the members of 
the group individually whenever needed.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Define blocks
▶
▶Insert blocks
▶
▶Edit blocks
▶
▶Redefine blocks
▶
▶Work with groups
Define Blocks
Before drawing and copying a series of repetitive elements, you should 
first define them as a block. This is because you have a higher level of 
organizational control over blocks than you do over individual entities. 
In this section, you will draw a chair and a door and then define them as 
blocks.

Understanding the Block Table
When the chair disappeared from the drawing canvas, it was defined in the 
drawing’s block table. Although every drawing has a block table, you can’t see 
it. Blocks defined there can be inserted into the drawing as block references. 
Changes made to block definitions (stored in the block table) affect all block 
references in the drawing.
Exercise 7.2: Draw a Door and Define  
It as a Block
In the following steps, you will draw a door and the representation of its swing 
(an arc) and define it as a block. To begin, open the file Ex07.2-start.dwg 
from the Chapter 7 companion files.

Insert Blocks
After you create a block definition, you can insert local block references (from 
the current drawing’s block table) into the drawing. In Chapter 9, “Working with 
Blocks and Xrefs,” you will learn how to create and insert global blocks, which 
are blocks that exist outside the current drawing file.

Edit Blocks
You can edit blocks after they have been defined and inserted into the drawing as 
block references. In addition to editing geometry, you can assign floating properties 
to control property inheritance, nest blocks within blocks, or explode blocks entirely.

Exercise 7.4: Edit Block Definitions
Block definitions are not set in stone; you can redraw them after block refer-
ences have been inserted multiple times in a drawing. In fact, this is one of the 
reasons to use blocks: efficient control over multiple objects from a single edit-
able definition. In the following steps, you will alter the door block and see all its 
references update automatically.
To begin, open the file Ex07.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Zoom in on the lower door in the middle room.
	
2.	 Select the door, right-click, and choose Edit Block In-Place from the 
context menu. Click OK in the Reference Edit dialog box that appears 
(see Figure 7.15).

Exercise 7.5: Assign Floating Properties
When you set an object’s color, linetype, or lineweight to specific values such 
as Red, Hidden, or 0.5 mm, you are setting those properties explicitly. Explicit 
object properties assigned to objects in block definitions are retained when 
those blocks are inserted onto different layers in the drawing.
It is often advantageous to assign floating properties—either ByLayer or 
ByBlock—to the objects in block definitions. Floating properties allow block 
references to inherit properties from the layer on which they are inserted. 
Alternatively, you can override these inherited properties with explicit properties 
by assigning them to the block reference.
The Furniture layer has been current throughout this chapter, so the objects 
you drew to define the chair and door blocks reside on this layer. In the follow-
ing steps, you will assign floating properties to the chair and door blocks.
To begin, open the file Ex07.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Click each of the four door block references to select them. Type qp 
(for Quick Properties) and press Enter. Select Door from the Layer 
drop-down menu (see Figure 7.17). Notice that the doors are still yel-
low even though the Door layer is green. Click the Close box in the 
upper-right corner to close the Quick Properties palette and press Esc 
to deselect.

choose Edit Block In-Place from the context menu. Click OK in the 
Reference Edit dialog box that appears.
	
3.	 Select the rectangle and arc making up the door.
	
4.	 Type qp (again, for Quick Properties) and press Enter. Open the Color 
drop-down menu and select ByBlock. Press Esc to deselect.
	
5.	 Click the Save Changes button in the Edit References panel. Click OK 
in the AutoCAD warning dialog box. The doors turn green because 
the ByBlock floating property allows them to inherit the Door layer’s 
green color.
	
6.	 Select the lower chair by clicking it. Open the Color drop-down menu 
in the Properties panel, select Magenta, and press Esc. The chair 
turns magenta because ByBlock allows explicit properties assigned to 
the block reference to override inherited layer properties.
	
7.	 Open the Layer drop-down menu in the Layers panel and set layer 0 
as the current layer.
	
8.	 Open the Layer drop-down menu again and toggle off the Furniture 
layer.
	
9.	 Toggle on the Furniture layer and click outside the Layer drop-down 
menu to close it.
	
10.	 Select a door, right-click, and choose Edit Block In-Place from the con-
text menu. Click OK in the Reference Edit dialog box that appears.
F i g u r e   7 . 1 7   Assigning the Door layer to the door block references

layer to the selection. Press Esc to deselect the layer.
	
13.	 Click the Save Changes button in the Edit References panel. Click OK 
in the AutoCAD warning dialog box.
	
14.	 Open the Layer drop-down menu in the Layers panel and toggle off 
the Furniture layer.
Blocks and Layer 0
You should always draw objects within block definitions on layer 0 so that block 
references will inherit the layer on which they are inserted. Layer 0 is the only 
layer that works like this for block definitions. In addition, you should assign 
floating properties for the color, linetype, and/or lineweight of the objects in 
the block definition.
	
15.	 Toggle on the Furniture layer.
Your model should now resemble Ex07.5-end.dwg, which is available among 
this chapter’s companion files.
Exercise 7.6: Nest Blocks
You can nest blocks within other blocks to simplify complex block definitions. 
However, you can’t create circular references where blocks reference themselves, 
or you’d create an infinite loop. In the following steps, you’ll nest a phone block 
reference inside the desk block definition so that every desk you insert will have 
a phone on it.
To begin, open the file Ex07.6-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Type BEDIT (for Block Editor) and press Enter. Select Desk in the

Exercise 7.7: Explode Blocks
There are two commands that blow away blocks, leaving you with only their 
defining geometry: EXPLODE and XPLODE. The former has no options whatso-
ever; the latter offers many options dealing with what happens to object proper-
ties after the block is disassembled.
To begin, open the file Ex07.7-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Click the Explode button on the Modify panel. Select the chair at the 
bottom of the desk and the door at the bottom of the middle room

Redefine Blocks
You already know that block definitions have names and that blocks are inserted 
by name. So, what do you suppose happens if you define a new block using a 
name that has already been used in the drawing?
Exercise 7.8: Redefine Block Definitions
In the following steps, you are presented with just such a situation; you will have 
the opportunity to redefine a block definition. Any block references in the draw-
ing will be automatically updated with the new definition.
To begin, open the file Ex07.8-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.

Work with Groups
Groups are a means of organizing objects in a way that is less formal than blocks. 
Groups don’t need to be named, nor do they require base points like blocks do. 
You can toggle group selection on and off so that you can manipulate the entire 
group as a unit or access individual members of the group at will. You can’t rede-
fine the many with the few like you can with blocks, however. That said, it’s cer-
tainly convenient to be able to manipulate many blocks with a few groups.
Exercise 7.9: Create Groups
In the following steps, you will group the desk and chairs, copy this group into 
adjacent rooms, and make adjustments to various blocks within the groups.
To begin, open the file Ex07.9-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.

Hatching and 
Gradients
The term hatching refers to filling bounded areas with solids, patterns, 
and/or gradients. You create hatching in the AutoCAD® program to indicate 
transitions between materials and to improve the readability of drawings in 
general. Hatching with solid fill, patterns, and/or tonal gradients can trans-
form staid line drawings into attractive illustrations. This chapter covers the 
basics of hatching so that you can use it in your own drawings. In AutoCAD 
2018, hatch display and performance are enhanced.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Specify hatch areas
▶
▶Associate hatches with boundaries
▶
▶Hatch with patterns
▶
▶Hatch with gradients
Specify Hatch Areas
Every hatch area is defined by a boundary containing the solid fill, pattern, 
or gradient. You can determine the boundary either by picking a point on 
the drawing canvas or by selecting an object or set of objects.
Exercise 8.1: Pick Points to Determine 
Boundaries
When a boundary is picked, AutoCAD uses a raycasting algorithm to deter-
mine the precise extents of the area bounded by the objects onscreen. In the 
following steps, you will pick points to determine the boundaries of multiple 
hatch objects.

Exercise 8.2: Select Objects to Define 
Boundaries
In complex drawings, picking points to determine boundaries sometimes 
doesn’t work. Fortunately, you can always define boundaries successfully using 
closed objects. In the following steps, you will select two closed objects to define 
a hatch boundary.
Begin by opening the file Ex08.2-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 To simplify the hatch boundary, you will draw a circle. Click the 
Circle tool on the Draw panel.
	
2.	 Shift+right-click and choose Node from the context menu. Click 
point A, shown in Figure 8.8, as the center point. Type QUA (for 
Quadrant) and press Enter. Click point B, also shown in Figure 8.8, to 
set the inner circle’s radius. The CIRCLE command ends.

which layer the circle is 
on; you will delete the 
circle later.

Associate Hatches with Boundaries
When hatches are associated with their boundary objects, the boundary objects 
themselves define the extents of the hatch fill, pattern, or gradient. Altering the 
shape of any of the boundary objects necessarily changes the extents of an asso-
ciated hatch object. For example, the rotor needs to have a larger diameter, and 
by associating the hatch with the outer circle, you will be able to get the hatch 
to expand to fill the larger rotor simply by changing the diameter of the circle.
Exercise 8.3: Associate Boundaries
In the following steps, you will re-create the boundary objects from the last 
hatch pattern created in the previous section. Then you will alter the shape of 
one of the boundary objects to change the extents of the solid hatch.
To begin, open Ex08.3-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Type HATCHEDIT and press Enter. Select the solid hatch in the outer 
portion of the rotor. The Hatch Edit dialog box appears (see Figure 8.10).
	
2.	 Click the Recreate Boundary tool on the Boundaries panel. Choose 
Polyline from the dynamic prompt menu and then click Yes to associ-
ate the hatch with the new boundary. Click OK.
	
3.	 Toggle on Object Snap on the status bar. Right-click this toggle but-
ton and turn on Center, Quadrant, and Endpoint running object snap 
modes in the context menu if they are not already on.
	
4.	 Toggle on Ortho mode on the status bar.
	
5.	 Toggle on Object Snap Tracking on the status bar.
	
6.	 Click the Scale tool on the Modify panel, select the rotor’s outer circle, 
and press Enter. Select the center of the rotor (point A in Figure 8.11) 
as the base point. The command prompt reads as follows:
SCALE Specify scale factor or [Copy Reference]:
Type R (for Reference) and press Enter. Pick the reference length by 
clicking points A and B, shown in Figure 8.11.
The Hatch Edit dialog 
box has the same 
functionality as the 
Hatch Editor tab on the 
ribbon.

Exercise 8.5: Separate Hatch Areas
When you picked points within multiple boundaries in the previous sec-
tion, doing so formed a single hatch object. The properties you specified were 
assigned to this object. However, at this point, you want to rotate the cross-
sectional pattern 90° on the right side to illustrate the separate pieces of metal 
that are bolted together. In the following steps, you will separate the multiple 
bounded areas of a single object into individual hatch objects and then rotate 
patterns on half of them.
To begin, open Ex08.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Type HATCHEDIT and press Enter. Select the hatch object inside the 
red boundaries on the right-hand section drawing.
	
2.	 Check Separate Hatches in the Options group of the Hatch Edit dia-
log box (see Figure 8.15) and click OK.
Exploding hatch pat-
terns removes their

Hatch with Gradients
In addition to hatching with solid fill and line patterns, you can hatch with one- and 
two-color gradients to vary tonality in a smooth fashion. Gradients can subtly hint at 
an extra dimension that helps make drawings more readable. In the following steps, 
you will create gradient hatches that give depth to metal parts in the drawings.

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to specify hatch areas and fill them with patterns and gradi-
ents. You also learned how to associate a boundary with hatches and gradients so that changes 
to the boundary automatically cause the fill to update. You can now use hatches and gradients 
to create attractive illustrations that add another layer of visual information to line drawings.

Working with Blocks 
and Xrefs 
In Chapter 7, “Organizing Objects,” you learned how to define and 
­reference blocks within a single drawing in the AutoCAD® program. In this 
chapter, you will create and insert global blocks from outside the current 
drawing. Harnessing the power of a search engine, you’ll cast a net across 
multiple drawings to locate specific blocks and a variety of other content. 
Once key content is found, you will place it on tool palettes for quick access 
in the future. In addition, you will make external references (Xrefs) to 
­drawings outside the current file.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Work with global blocks
▶
▶Access content globally
▶
▶Store content on tool palettes
▶
▶Reference external drawings and images
Work with Global Blocks
Global blocks are drawing files that you will later insert as blocks into 
another drawing. In this section, you will learn how to write local blocks 
to files, insert a drawing file as a local block, and redefine local blocks with 
global blocks.
Exercise 9.1: Write a Local Block Definition  
to a File
In the following steps, you will export one of the current drawing’s block 
definitions to an individual drawing file. In addition, you will open the newly 
created file and alter its contents.

Access Content Globally
The DesignCenter™ allows you to search for—and insert—content from within 
other drawings on your local area network (LAN). Using the DesignCenter to 
locate and insert blocks is much more efficient than writing blocks to files and 
then inserting the resulting files into drawings, as you learned in the previous 
section.
Exercise 9.4: Access Global Content
In the following steps, you will use the DesignCenter to search for blocks and 
other types of content. To begin, open the file Ex09.4-start.dwg from the 
Chapter 9 companion files.
	
1.	 Type ADC and press Enter to launch Autodesk’s DesignCenter, an

Store Content on Tool Palettes
Tool palettes are used for storing just about any type of content for quick reuse. 
You create tools on a palette by dragging objects—including blocks, hatches, 
images, dimensions, tables, lights, cameras, materials, visual styles, and  
Xrefs—onto the palette from any saved drawing.
Exercise 9.5: Add to the Tool Palettes
In the following steps, you’ll create a new palette, drag a sofa onto it, and then 
use the tool to add another sofa. To begin, open the file Ex09.5-start.dwg

Reference External Drawings and Images
External references (called Xrefs) are a more dynamic alternative to blocks. Xrefs 
linked to the current drawing are automatically updated every time the cur-
rent drawing is opened. Blocks, on the other hand, must be edited in place or 
redefined when they are changed. The real efficiency with Xrefs comes when you 
link one file to multiple drawing files because changes made to the linked file 
are automatically reloaded in all the files that have the Xref attached.
Exercise 9.6: Use Xrefs
In the following steps, you will externally reference a core (elevators, stairs, 
shafts) and shell (exterior envelope) drawing into the drawing containing items 
owned by the building tenant (walls, doors, furniture, and so on). The advantage 
of working this way is that the core and shell generally do not change from floor 
to floor, whereas the tenant improvement drawings are typically unique to each 
floor. Changes to the core and/or shell can be made in separate drawings that 
are linked to all the individual tenant drawings.
◀
This is just one example 
of using Xrefs in the case 
of a high-rise building. 
Xrefs can be used in 
every discipline when-
ever you want the advan-
tages they provide.

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to work with global blocks, access content globally, store 
content on tool palettes, and reference external drawings and images.
Externally Referencing or Importing PDFs
Xrefing a PDF works identically to Xrefing an image in that either type of data can 
be attached to your drawings but not edited. Use IMPORT to edit PDF geometry 
in AutoCAD. Any images that are part of an imported PDF file are attached to 
the drawing as Xrefs. 

Chapter 10
Creating and  
Editing Text
Text is an essential part of every drawing. You use the written word to 
clarify graphical depictions and delineate your design intent with specific 
language. It’s good to remember that drawings can be used as part of legal 
construction documents, and you typically need to clarify your design intent 
with text that appears on the drawings themselves. In this chapter, you’ll 
learn how to style text, how to write both lines and paragraphs of text using 
specialized commands, and how to edit existing text.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Style text
▶
▶Write lines of text
▶
▶Write and format paragraphs using MTEXT
▶
▶Edit text
▶
▶Recognize and combine text
Style Text
The AutoCAD® software can’t help you with your grammar or linguistic 
style, but it can style the appearance of text. Text styles associate specific 
fonts, optional text heights, and special effects with text objects.
Exercise 10.1: Create Text Styles
In the following steps, you will create the text styles that you will use 
in the next section when creating text objects. Begin by opening the 
file Ex10.1-start.dwg, which is among the companion files avail-
able for download from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/

them on the drawing canvas.
Write Lines of Text
You will use the TEXT command when you want to create a single line of text. 
TEXT creates independent objects on every line so that these objects are suitable 
for use in symbols or labels on drawings. You will learn how to create text that 
fits within a rectangle or circle, for example. In addition, you will justify text so 
that it can be easily reused and its content changed without having to reposition 
the text every time to maintain alignment with surrounding geometry. You will 
also discover that text objects can be manipulated and duplicated using many of 
the commands you already know.
Exercise 10.2: Create Text to Fit
There are many situations where you will want to fit text within geometric 
objects. For example, you might employ a rectangular symbol in which a num-
ber of room names might be displayed in each case where the symbol is to be 
used. If a text object were always to fit perfectly within the given rectangle, it 
would simplify having to create rectangles of different widths for each room in 
which the symbol is to be used. In the following steps, you will create single-line 
text, justified to fit within just such a rectangular symbol.
To begin, open the file Ex10.2-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Zoom in on the small rectangle in the upper-left corner of the draw-
ing canvas.
	
2.	 Click the Offset tool in the Modify panel, type 4 (or 10 for metric) to 
set the offset distance, and press Enter. Select the small rectangle

Exercise 10.4: Transform and Create Text
Text objects can be transformed with the same commands you might use on 
other types of objects—commands such as MOVE, COPY, ROTATE, SCALE, and 
MIRROR. In the following steps, you will mirror and copy existing text to create 
new text objects that you will alter later, in the “Edit Text” section. In addition, 
you will create new text in a different style.
To begin, open the file Ex10.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Click the Mirror tool on the Modify panel, select the text object (3), 
and press Enter. Click the start point at A and the endpoint at B in 
Figure 10.6 to define the mirror. The command line reads as follows:
MIRROR Erase source objects? [Yes No] <N>:
	
2.	 Press Enter to accept the default, No, and the MIRROR command is 
done.
	
3.	 Click the Copy tool on the Modify panel, type L (for Last), and press 
Enter twice. Click an arbitrary point on the drawing canvas, move 
the cursor to the right from this point, type 4' (or 140 for metric), and 
press Enter twice. A new text object is created to the right of the text 
you mirrored in the previous step.
	
4.	 Select the Annotate tab on the ribbon and select the Single Line text 
tool in the Text panel. The command prompt reads as follows:

Mirroring Text and Monitoring System Variables
Set the MIRRTEXT system variable to 1 to mirror text as well as objects with 
the MIRROR command. Text mirrored with MIRRTEXT set to 1 appears 
backward or upside down.
The System Variable Monitor (SYSVARMONITOR command) notifies you when 
any system variables you put into a list are changed by yourself or others. For 
example, by default whenever MIRRTEXT is changed from the preferred value 
of 0, you will be notified on the command line so you can decide whether you 
really want to mirror text backward or upside down.
In AutoCAD 2018, you can right-click the System Variable icon in the status bar 
to reset to preferred values without having to open the System Variable Monitor 
dialog box.

Write and Format Paragraphs Using MTEXT
The MTEXT command is a word processing program within AutoCAD that treats 
all the lines and paragraphs you write as a single object. The powerful MTEXT 
command gives you word wrap, per-letter style overrides, tabs, inline spell 
checking, control over line spacing, bulleted and numbered lists, column  
formatting, and many other features.
MTEXT is ideally suited to writing general notes on drawings and other lengthy 
blocks of text. In the following steps, you will create and format some unusual 
general notes. Instead of typing multiple paragraphs, you’ll import one of the 
most famous monologues in the English language and turn it into a series of 
hypothetical steps.
Exercise 10.5: Write and Format with MTEXT
To begin, open the file Ex10.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files. In addition, get the file Hamlet.txt and double-click the file to open it in 
Notepad on the PC or TextEdit on the Mac. Select Format ➢ Word Wrap to see

Edit Text
Editing text can mean many different things, from changing content (the 
words) and text object properties to creating multiple columns of text. You 
would be frustrated indeed if you couldn’t correct typographical errors, because 
everyone seems to make them. Fortunately, editing text is as simple as double-
clicking, highlighting the text in question, and retyping. It is also easy to create 
multiple columns in AutoCAD by dragging a grip. Creating columns of text can 
help you fit the required words into the space available on your drawings.

the drawing and its title block on a typical drawing. Creating multiple columns 
gives you more layout options, allowing you to find the best fit for paragraphs of 
text within the space available. In the following steps, you will move object grips 
to create and size two columns.

Recognize and Combine Text
Unfortunately, it is impossible to store AutoCAD’s native SHX fonts as text in 
Adobe PDF files. Instead, AutoCAD’s SHX text that is exported to PDF is stored 
as geometry. The text geometry looks and prints exactly the same from the PDF 
as it would from AutoCAD. However, if the exported PDF file is later imported 
back into AutoCAD, its geometric text is not editable as text.

PDF is the most popular format for exchanging data with consultants 
who don’t use AutoCAD, so round-trip exports and imports of PDF files with 
AutoCAD are common. AutoCAD 2018 has a new Recognize SHX Text tool 
(PDFSHXTEXT command) that allows text that is imported as geometry to be 
later converted back into editable SHX text.
The Recognize SHX Text tool outputs single lines of MTEXT. AutoCAD 2018 
has another new tool, Combine Text (TXT2MTEXT command), that allows you 
to combine multiple text entities into a single MTEXT entity. Using the two new 
tools together allows you to export SHX text written in AutoCAD to the PDF  
format and import it back again into AutoCAD, maintaining it as multiline text.
Exercise 10.8: Import, Recognize, and Combine 
Text from PDF
The optimal process for importing text from Adobe PDF files involves three sepa-
rate commands: PDFIMPORT, PDFSHXTEXT, and TXT2MTXT, optimally used in that 
order. In the following steps, you will import and recognize SHX text and then com-
bine its output into a single multiline text entity. To begin, start a new drawing.
	
1.	 On the Insert tab, click the PDF Import tool and select Ex10.8.pdf. 
This is the text block from the previous exercise exported to PDF.
	
2.	 Click OK to accept the default settings in the Import PDF dialog box

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to create text styles, write lines of text, write and format 
paragraphs, and edit any text object. In short, you know what it takes to document and design 
with text in AutoCAD.

Chapter 11
Dimensioning 
Dimensioning is the art of annotating drawings with precise numerical 
measurements. The process is generally straightforward in the AutoCAD® 
program because everything is typically drawn in real-world scale. 
Dimensions will automatically display the correct measurements as long as 
the geometric objects to which they refer are drawn to actual size.
In this chapter, you’ll learn the mechanics of dimensioning in model 
space. Dimensioning in paper space and in viewports is covered in 
Chapter 13, “Working with Layouts and Annotative Objects.”
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Style dimensions
▶
▶Add dimensions
▶
▶Edit dimensions
Style Dimensions
The appearance of dimensions (the size of text and arrows, the length of 
extension lines, and so on) is controlled by dimension styles. Every drawing 
comes with a Standard dimension style, which of course is the current style 
because there is only one by default. When you create more than one dimen-
sion style, you must choose which one is current. New dimension objects are 
assigned the current dimension style in much the same way that objects and 
layers or text and text styles work.
You can customize dimension styles and even create substyles to control 
the way different types of dimensions appear according to your personal 
preferences or to adhere to a corporate or industry standard established for 
dimensions. For example, if you want to use architectural tick marks rather 
than arrowheads for linear and aligned dimensions but want to use arrow-
heads for radius, diameter, and angular dimensions, you can encode these 
preferences in a dimension style and a series of substyles.

Add Dimensions
In technical drawings, dimensions are typically measurements for which the 
designer may be legally responsible. So although it is essential to know how to 
add specific dimensions to a drawing, it is also useful to use inquiry commands 
that measure linear objects (MEASUREGEOM or DIST) or find areas (AREA) with-
out making specific annotations in the drawing. You will explore how to do so 
in the following section. In addition, you will add a variety of dimension objects 
that show specific measurements on the drawing. The section ends with a  
discussion on how to add a multileader, which is text with an arrow pointing to 
a specific geometric feature in a drawing.
Exercise 11.2: Use Inquiry Commands
Use inquiry commands when you want to find out (but not document) the 
length, angle, name, and/or area of a specific feature without annotating the

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to style, add, and edit dimensions. Now you know how to 
document designs with specific measurements.

Chapter 12
The AutoCAD LT® 
­program cannot create 
constraints. However, 
AutoCAD LT 2016 and 
later users can view 
and edit constraints 
that were created in 
AutoCAD.
▶
Keeping In Control 
with Constraints
Constraints are specific restrictions applied to objects that allow for 
design exploration while maintaining object shape and/or size within  
predefined limits. In this chapter, you will create three types of constraints 
in the AutoCAD® 2018 program: geometric, dimensional, and user ­created. 
Once the design has been sufficiently constrained, you will make a host 
of geometric and dimensional changes simply by changing a single 
parameter.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Work with geometric constraints
▶
▶Apply dimensional constraints
▶
▶Constrain objects simultaneously with geometry and dimensions
▶
▶Make parametric changes to constrained objects
Work with Geometric Constraints
Geometric constraints allow you to force specific 2D objects to be coin-
cident, collinear, concentric, parallel, perpendicular, horizontal, vertical, 
tangent, smooth, and symmetric; to have equal lengths; or to be fixed in 
world space. In the following exercise, you will assign sufficient geometric 
constraints to ensure that a rectangle will always remain square even when 
it is stretched.
Exercise 12.1: Use Geometric Constraints
Begin by opening the file Ex12.1-start.dwg, which is among the compan-
ion files available for download from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/

Apply Dimensional Constraints
Dimensional constraints allow you to control object sizes with specific numeri-
cal values and to set up dynamic dimensional relationships with mathematical 
equations and formulas. User constraints are not tied to specific geometry but 
hold values calculated from dimensional constraints. In the following exercise, 
you will create dimensional constraints.

Constrain Objects Simultaneously  
with Geometry and Dimensions
You can use geometric and dimensional constraints together to force objects to 
conform to your design intent. In the following exercise, you will draw two more 
circles and constrain their positions and sizes using a combination of geometric 
and dimensional constraints.
Exercise 12.3: Use Simultaneous Constraints
To begin, open the file Ex12.3-start.dwg.
	
1.	 Select the ribbon’s Home tab, open the Layer drop-down menu in the 
Layers panel, and select Layer 3 to make it the current layer.
	
2.	 Type C (for Circle) and press Enter. Draw an arbitrarily sized circle 
anywhere within the square.
	
3.	 Select the ribbon’s Parametric tab and then click the Concentric con-

Make Parametric Changes  
to Constrained Objects
Once you have intelligently applied geometric and/or dimensional constraints, 
it is easy to make parametric changes that affect the shape and/or size of 
multiple interconnected objects. In the following exercise, you will change a 
single parameter (d1) and see how it affects the objects you have constrained. 
In addition, you will add dimensions to two circles and uncover an amazing 
coincidence.
All constraints are 
hidden but still active.

Working with Layouts 
and Annotative 
Objects
There are two distinct spaces in which you can create drawings: model 
space and paper space. Typically, 2D drawings and 3D models are created in 
model space. Layouts in paper space bring together annotations and draw-
ings ultimately to be plotted on paper or published electronically. Viewports 
display drawings at specific scales on layouts, which is where you’ll draw title 
blocks that frame the drawings.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Create annotative styles and objects
▶
▶Create layouts
▶
▶Adjust floating viewports
▶
▶Override layer properties in layout viewports
▶
▶Draw on layouts
Create Annotative Styles and Objects
All the geometry you draw in the AutoCAD® program is created at its actual 
size. However, the heights of text, dimensions, and attributes present a 
potential problem. As drawings are scaled down from their real-world size to 
be represented on paper using viewport scale (which you’ll learn more about 
in the “Adjust Floating Viewports” section later in this chapter), text, dimen-
sions, and attributes are likewise scaled down to fit on paper.
Annotative objects allow you to automatically display text, dimensions, 
and attributes at different heights on the same drawing according to the 
AutoCAD® 2018 and AutoCAD LT® 2018 Essentials

viewport scale in which they are displayed. The purpose of annotative styles 
is to control the appearance of annotative objects such as text, dimensions, 
and attributes. I will discuss both text and dimensions in upcoming sec-
tions but will hold off on attributes until Chapter 15, “Working with Data.” 
As you’ll see, annotative objects change their sizes automatically to fit the 
drawing scale.
Exercise 13.1: Work with Annotative Text
In the following steps, you will configure an annotative text style to display text 
at 1/8" (or 0.4 cm) high on paper. All the text objects assigned to this style will 
automatically adjust their heights to 1/8" (or 0.4 cm) no matter in what scale 
the drawing is shown. In this way, annotative objects automatically change their 
sizes relative to other geometry in the drawing.
Begin by opening the file Ex13.1-start.dwg, which is among the compan-
ion files available for download from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/

Create Layouts
Think of layouts as sheets of virtual paper because that’s what they represent. 
You will create layouts whether you ultimately plan to publish the drawing on 
paper or in electronic form. Each drawing can have multiple layouts to publish 
in a variety of formats.
Exercise 13.3: Configure Layouts
In the following steps, you will create two layouts, one for an 8.5" × 11" sheet 
of paper (or ISO A4) and another for a 30" × 42" drawing (or ISO A0), which are 
standard business and drawing sizes.
To begin, open the file Ex13.3-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Click the Layer Properties tool in the Layers panel on the ribbon’s 
Home tab.
	
2.	 Click the New Layer button in the Layer Properties Manager that 
appears. Type Z-Viewport and press Enter. Double click Z-Viewport’s 
status icon to set this layer as current (it changes to a green check 
mark). Click the printer icon in the Z-Viewport layer’s Plot column 
to make this layer nonplotting (see Figure 13.9). Close the Layer 
Properties Manager.

tion and size their frames however you like in relation to the paper represented 
in a layout. You will configure a single floating viewport on Layout1 and two 
separate viewports on Layout2 to gain experience with viewports.

Exercise 13.5: Work on Layout2
In the following steps, you will adjust the viewport on Layout2 and, in the pro-
cess, discover that certain combinations of building geometry, viewport scales, 
and paper sizes do not always mesh. You will fix the problem by selecting a 
­different viewport scale and then adjust the viewport to fit the floor plan. In 
addition, you’ll create a viewport from scratch and adjust it.
To begin, open the file Ex13.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Select the Layout2 tab in the lower-left corner of the user interface.
	
2.	 Double-click inside the viewport to activate model space.
	
3.	 Choose 1/4" = 1'-0" (or 1:40 in metric) from the Viewport Scale menu 
on the status bar.
	
4.	 Double-click the layout outside of the viewport to switch back into 
paper space.
	
5.	 Viewport frames exist in paper space only. Click the viewport frame 
to select it. Select the upper-right grip and move it upward until it is 
close to the upper-right corner of the paper but inside the plot device 
limits. Click the lower-left grip and move it to the lower-left corner 
inside the device limits (see Figure 13.18). Press Esc to deselect.

to turn off a selection of layers in a particular viewport while continuing to dis-
play these same layers in another viewport.

Draw on Layouts
You can draw on layouts just as you can draw in model space. However, the 
types of content drawn on layouts will necessarily be of a different character, 
such as a title block, viewports, and (optionally) dimensions. Layouts have the 
measurements of physical sheets of paper and are not meant to hold real-world 
geometry directly (that’s what model space is used for).
One way to draw directly on layouts is to use title blocks, which are borders 
surrounding the drawing that also have rectangles in which text identifying the 
sheet is placed. You can also draw dimensions directly on layouts. Dimensions 
added in paper space are associated with geometry in model space. If the real-
world geometry changes, the dimensions will automatically update.
Exercise 13.7: Lay Out Geometry
In the following steps, you will draw a title block and add a dimension to the 
paper space of the layout. To begin, open the file Ex13.7-start.dwg from this 
chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Type LA (for Layer Properties Manager) and press Enter. Click the New 
Layer icon, type Z-Title, and press Enter. Double-click the new layer 
to make it current. Select a Lineweight value of 0.039" (or 1.00 mm in 
metric) for a thick border. Close the Layer Properties Manager.

Chapter 14
Printing and Plotting
Plotting is the term for producing output using a large-format printer 
(which is networked or directly connected to an AutoCAD® workstation) or 
exporting to an electronic drawing format. There is much more to plotting a 
drawing or publishing an entire sheet set than clicking the Print icon, how-
ever. Before you can successfully print, you must learn to configure a plotter 
and a plot style table; you’ll then learn how to create professional output 
from model space and paper space. As you’ll see in this chapter, you’ll also 
have the option to keep everything in digital format and export DWF or PDF 
files that can be shared on the Internet with your partners and clients.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Configure output devices
▶
▶Create plot style tables
▶
▶Use plot style tables
▶
▶Plot in model space
▶
▶Plot layouts in paper space
▶
▶Export to an electronic format
Configure Output Devices
In the most general sense, everything you do on a computer is a form of 
input. Creating physical or even electronic drawings are forms of output. 
Output devices are more commonly known as printers.
Large-format (24" wide or larger) printers are marketed as “plotters” 
because of the history of technology. When I started my career more than 
20 years ago, plotters had technical pens in them that you had to refill indi-
vidually with ink. The paper (actually Mylar film) was rolled back and forth, 
and the pens literally plotted one line at a time. Thankfully, modern inkjet 
technology is much faster, so you no longer wind up with clogged pens and 
ink on your hands.

In the following sections, you will configure an output device by setting up 
a system printer and an AutoCAD plotter. Once these steps are completed, you 
won’t have to perform them again on the same computer.
Exercise 14.1: Set Up a System Printer
The first thing you’ll need to do is set up a system printer, which contains  
drivers that your operating system uses to control the output device. System 
printers are not specific to AutoCAD; device manufacturers supply drivers, 
which you then install to become printers on your system.
If you are reading this book at work, you undoubtedly already have a system 
printer or your CAD manager has installed one for you. For the purposes of this 
book, however, you will install a driver for the HP DesignJet T920 plotter (an 
industry workhorse), whether or not you own this device. You will be using the 
HP DesignJet T920 system printer in this chapter. The following steps guide you 
in installing this typical system printer:
	
1.	 Open your browser and type HP DesignJet T920 eprinter driver into 
your favorite search engine. Select the first search result or go to 
www.hp.com and search for Download Drivers and Software.
	
2.	 Download the appropriate driver for your system.
	
3.	 Install the HP DesignJet T920 HPGL2 driver following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Select File:Port in the installation options 
because you don’t have access to the actual device. If you did have the 
physical device, you would select the relevant connection port, such 
as Ethernet, USB, or Wireless.
Exercise 14.2: Set Up an AutoCAD Plotter
Most programs send output directly to system printers, but AutoCAD is an 
exception. AutoCAD has another layer of software between the program and the 
operating system known as an AutoCAD plotter. In this section, you will set up 
an AutoCAD plotter that sends its output to the system printer, which in turn 
hands off the print job to the output device itself.
	
1.	 In a blank AutoCAD drawing, type PLOTTERMANAGER and press 
Enter. The Windows Explorer dialog box appears displaying the Add-
A-Plotter Wizard and various AutoCAD plotters that have the .pc3 
file extension (see Figure 14.1).
▶
AutoCAD for Mac 
doesn’t use AutoCAD 
plotters but instead 
outputs directly to 
the system printers 
listed under System 
Preferences.

2.	 Double-click the Add-A-Plotter Wizard. Read the Introduction page 
and click Next.
	
3.	 Select the System Printer radio button and click Next.
Plotting Raster Images to Scale
Raster images of drawing layers can be output to scale from AutoCAD and enhanced 
in Adobe Photoshop for presentation. For more information on setting up and 
plotting to a raster plotter driver in AutoCAD, see my book Enhancing Architectural 
Drawings and Models with Photoshop (Sybex, 2010).
	
4.	 Select the HP DesignJet T920 HPGL2 system printer from the list in 
the Add Plotter – System Printer dialog box. The listed printers will 
differ on your computer depending on which drivers you (or your 
CAD manager) have already installed on your system. Click Next.
	
5.	 The next page allows you to import a legacy PCP or PC2 file from 
older versions of AutoCAD. Since you are creating a PC3 file from 
scratch, click Next to open the Add Plotter – Plotter Name page.

the name of the system printer. Type the name HP DesignJet T920 
Plotter to differentiate the new printer name from the system printer. 
Click Next.
	
7.	 The final page of the Add-A-Plotter Wizard allows you to edit the 
newly created plotter driver itself. Click the Edit Plotter Configuration 
button to do this.
	
8.	 Select the Device And Document Settings tab and then select the 
Filter Paper Sizes node in the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog

Create Plot Style Tables
Plot style tables determine the final appearance of objects in terms of their 
color, linetype, lineweight, end cap, line fill, and screening percentage. 
Plot style tables take precedence over layer properties when the drawing is 
printed.
In addition to creating a system printer and AutoCAD plotter, you will need to 
create a plot style table or use an existing one. AutoCAD has two types of plot 
style tables:
Color-Dependent Plot Style Tables (CTB Files)    These have been used since 
the days of pen plotters when you assigned a number of colors in AutoCAD to a 
specific physical pen. For example, red objects might plot using the 0.5 mm pen, 
and green and yellow objects might use the 0.7 mm pen. Many firms still use 
color-dependent plot style tables today.
Named Plot Styles (STB Files)    These were a new feature in AutoCAD 2000. 
Named plot style tables offer greater flexibility as compared with color-dependent 
plot styles because plot criteria can be assigned by layer or by object rather 
than by color only. In the following exercise, you will create a named plot style. 
Named plot styles use the .stb file extension.
Exercise 14.3: Create a Named Plot Style Table
In this exercise, you will create a named plot style table. Plot style tables control 
the appearance of objects when they are plotted.
	
1.	 Type STYLESMANAGER and press Enter. Windows Explorer appears 
and displays a number of preset plot style table files.
	
2.	 Double-click the Add-A-Plot Style Table Wizard. Read the introductory 
page and then click Next.
	
3.	 Select Start From Scratch on the next page. Click Next.
	
4.	 Select the Named Plot Style radio button on the next page. This will 
create a named plot style having one default style called Normal. 
Click Next.
◀
You cannot create or 
modify plot styles on 
the Mac version of 
AutoCAD—you can use 
only the default plot 
styles.

plot style table you just created, My plot style.stb, appears in 
the Windows Explorer window that was opened in step 1. Click the 
close box in Windows Explorer.
Screening refers to the 
intensity of ink sprayed 
on the paper while 
plotting. Selecting 
100 directs the inkjet 
print head to spray at 
full intensity, whereas 
setting this value to 0 
will not spray any ink. 
Intermediate values 
produce varying levels 
of grayscale.

Use Plot Style Tables
New drawings are created using either color-dependent or named plot style 
tables. A setting in the Options dialog box controls this behavior. Existing draw-
ings must go through a conversion process to switch from using one plot style 
table type to the other.
Exercise 14.4: Configure New Drawings for 
Named Plot Style Tables
In the following steps, you will configure new drawings to use named plot styles, 
and you will save a template that has a named plot style table assigned:
	
1.	 Type OP (for Options) and press Enter. Select the Plot And Publish 
tab in the Options dialog box that appears.
	
2.	 Click the Plot Style Table Settings button in the lower right of the 
Options dialog box. Select the Use Named Plot Styles radio button in 
the Plot Style Table Settings dialog box that appears. Select My plot 
style.stb from the Default Plot Style Table drop-down menu. Select 
Black from the Default Plot Style For Layer 0 drop-down menu. Select 
ByLayer from the Default Plot Style For Objects drop-down menu if it 
is not already selected (see Figure 14.4). Click OK and then click OK 
again to close both of the open dialog boxes.
◀
After you decide (or 
your CAD manager 
decides for you) which 
type of plot style table 
to use consistently, 
you will want to save a 
template that records 
this preference so 
that you don’t have to 
revisit this issue every 
time you create a new 
drawing.

tion is required.
Switching Plot Style Table Types in Existing 
Drawings
If you are switching from named plot styles to color-dependent plot styles in an 
existing drawing, use the CONVERTPSTYLES command to make the conver-
sion. If you are going in the other direction and converting an existing drawing 
from color-dependent plot styles to named plot styles, you must first use the 
CONVERTCTB command and then use CONVERTPSTYLES.
Exercise 14.5: Assign Plot Styles by Layer  
or by Object
If you are working in a drawing that uses a color-dependent plot style table, then 
the plot styles are automatically configured by color. When working on a draw-
ing that uses a named plot style table, you will need to assign named plot styles 
by layer or by object, as shown in the following exercise.
Start by opening the file Ex14.5-start.dwg, which is among the companion

Plot Layouts in Paper Space
Layouts are the preferred plotting environment where you can display multiple 
scaled drawings within viewports, surrounded by title blocks containing text, or 
having dimensions in paper space. In the following exercise, you will create and 
plot two layouts from paper space.
Exercise 14.7: Plot from Paper Space

menu. Click OK.
	
4.	 The Page Setup Manager dialog box now lists Setup1 as a saved page 
setup. Select Display When Creating A New Layout (see Figure 14.19). 
Click the Set Current button and then click Close.
	
5.	 Double-click within the viewport to activate floating model space. 
Select 3/8" = 1'-0" from the Viewport Scale menu on the status bar. 
Double-click outside the viewport on the drawing canvas to return to 
paper space.
	
6.	 Select the viewport and stretch its grips to reveal and center the 
entire building, as shown in Figure 14.20. You might need to move 
the viewport to center the building on the page, depending on how 
you stretch the grips.
Layouts are always 
plotted at 1:1 scale in 
Imperial units. Metric 
layouts are also plot-
ted at 1:1 scale, if 1 
millimeter equals 1 
drawing unit, or at 10:1 
scale if you decide 1 
centimeter equals 1 
drawing unit.

Working with Data
The AutoCAD® program has several features that allow you to manipu-
late data within your drawings. (Please note that the AutoCAD® LT program 
doesn’t support these features.) In this chapter, you’ll begin by geolocating 
project geometry. Then you will define attributes within a block definition 
in order to store nongraphical data. You’ll proceed to enter values in several 
block references, and then you’ll create a table to organize and display this 
data on a drawing layout. The data shown in the table will be a mixture of 
static text and dynamically linked fields that display textual information in 
model space. After creating this complex data management system, you’ll 
change one of the attribute’s values and watch as the fields displaying data in 
the table automatically update.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Geolocate projects
▶
▶Import SketchUp models
▶
▶Define attributes and blocks
▶
▶Insert attributed blocks
▶
▶Edit table styles and create tables
▶
▶Use fields in table cells
▶
▶Edit table data
Geolocate Projects
In AutoCAD, you can store your project’s geographic location and site orien-
tation with respect to true north within the drawing file. This information 
can be specified using road maps or aerial imagery all within AutoCAD, with-
out your having to use another program to access this information (such as

When geolocated blocks or images are inserted or attached to your drawing 
files, they are aligned using the geographic data as the common point of refer-
ence. When each team member uses geolocated drawings, drawing coordination 
will be automatically streamlined. In the following steps, you will geolocate a 
drawing using the AutoCAD built-in mapping service.
Exercise 15.1: Geolocate a Drawing
In this exercise you will locate a project on the earth. Begin by opening the 
file Ex15.1-start.dwg (see Figure 15.1), which is among the companion 
files available for download from the book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/
autocad2018essentials.

The drawing is an 
elaboration on the 
diagram you dimen-
sioned in Chapter 11, 
“Dimensioning.”

Using Design Feed
Design Feed is accessible from the Autodesk® 360 Ribbon tab. Use Design Feed 
to share text messages and images with your colleagues. Posts are created and 
read using AutoCAD or the free AutoCAD® WS app for mobile devices. Whenever 
you tag a colleague in a post, your post automatically appears in their Design 
Feed palette or AutoCAD WS app, and they also are notified by email. All posts 
are stored in Autodesk 360 no matter where they are created, so you can stay 
electronically connected to your colleagues in the office and in the field. You can 
also optionally geolocate your posts in drawings so that they refer to specific 
areas in the real world.

Define Attributes and Blocks
Blocks can be defined with attributes that contain any manner of textual infor-
mation relevant to the object in question. Let’s explore this topic in an exercise. 
First you’ll alter the Annotative text style that will be used by the attributes you 

2 9 4  
C h ap t e r  15  • Wo r k i n g w i t h  D at a 	   
create. Then you’ll create attribute definitions to store employees’ names and ID 
numbers. Finally, you’ll define a simple block composed of two rectangles con-
taining the attribute definitions.
Exercise 15.3: Define Attributes and a Block
In this exercise you will create attribute definitions and include them in a block 
definition. To begin, open Ex15.3-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
download.
	
1.	 Type ST (for Style) and press Enter. Select the Annotative style in the Styles 
list on the left side of the Text Style dialog box. Select romans.shx in

midpoint at point D in Figure 15.8. Figure 15.10 shows the result.
Understanding the Parts of an Attribute
Tag, Prompt, and Value, along with a number of additional settings and optional 
modes, define every attribute. Tag is the programming name (typically capital-
ized without any spaces in the tag). Prompt is the question you’ll be asking the 
person who inserts the attributed block, prompting them to enter the attribute 
value. The value is entered only when the attributed block is inserted and not 
when the attribute is defined (see the next section, “Insert Attributed Blocks”). 
The optional Default setting displays a default value when the attributed block 
is eventually inserted into a drawing.

Fields are variables that are inserted into blocks of text that can change what 
they display over time. For example, you can insert a date field onto a title block 
that will update to show the current date every time the drawing is plotted. You 
can also link fields to objects in the drawing so that the field will display any 
one of the object properties. In the following steps, you’ll insert fields into cells 
within the table you designed in the previous section.

Now You Know
In this chapter, you learned how to geolocate projects, import SketchUp models, define attri-
butes and blocks, insert attributed blocks, edit table styles and create tables, use fields in 
table cells, and edit table data. Now you can work with a wide variety of data types and display 
information in tables on layouts.

Chapter 17
Modeling in 3D
The AutoCAD® program has three different 3D modeling toolsets  
comprising surfaces, solids, and meshes, reflecting the historical evolution 
of computer graphics. Each toolset was initially developed to suit specific 
industries: surfaces for industrial design, solids for engineering, and meshes 
for games and movies. Each toolset has its particular strengths and limita-
tions that become evident the more you use it. Yet AutoCAD allows you to 
pick the best tool for the job no matter what type of work you do so that you 
can find the best solutions for your models.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:
▶
▶Create surface models
▶
▶Edit surface models
▶
▶Create solid models
▶
▶Edit solid models
▶
▶Smooth mesh models
▶
▶Live-section models
Create Surface Models
In this chapter, you will create a conceptual model of the O2 Arena in 
London, the same model used in Chapter 16, “Navigating 3D Models.”
In AutoCAD, surfaces are defined as infinitely thin shells that do not  
contain any mass or volume. To create surfaces in this chapter, you’ll use 
two-dimensional profile shapes (provided as part of this chapter’s companion 
files, available for download from the book’s web page at www.sybex.com/
go/autocad2018essentials). You will begin the following exercise by 
creating a planar surface and then revolving, sweeping, and extruding 2D 
profiles into 3D surfaces.

Exercise 17.1: Make Planar Surfaces
Planar surfaces differ from flat bounded areas like circles and closed polylines 
in that they display surfaces rather than edges only, in shaded visual styles. 
Open the file Ex17.1-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files available 
on this book’s web page.
	
1.	 Select the 3D Modeling workspace from the Quick Access toolbar.
	
2.	 Select the ribbon’s Home tab if it is not already selected and click the 
Make Current tool in the Layers panel. Select the circle at the center 
of the drawing to set the Dome Membrane layer as current.
	
3.	 Select the ribbon’s Surface tab and click the Surface Associativity 
toggle in the Create panel if it is not already highlighted in blue.
	
4.	 Select the Planar tool in the Create panel. The command prompt 
reads as follows:
PLANESURF Specify first corner or [Object] <Object>:
Press Enter to accept the default Object option. Select the blue 
circle at the center of the drawing and press Enter. A planar surface 
appears as the PLANESURF command ends.
	
5.	 Click the SW corner of the ViewCube® to move to a SW isometric 
viewpoint. The blue planar surface you just created is visible at the 
top of the dome (see Figure 17.1).
▶
Like dimensions, sur-
faces can optionally 
be associated with the 
profile shapes that 
define them. Altering 
the shape of a profile 
immediately changes 
the form of its associ-
ated surface.

Exercise 17.2: Revolve a 2D Profile to Create  
a 3D Model
Much like you would turn wood on a lathe, you create 3D surfaces by revolving 
open profiles such as lines, arcs, or polylines around an axis. In the following 
steps, you will revolve a single arc to generate the exterior surface of the dome. 
To begin, open Ex17.2-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Select the ribbon’s Surface tab and toggle off the Surface 
Associativity icon in the Create panel.
	
2.	 Select the Revolve tool on the Create panel of the ribbon’s Surface 
tab. Select the blue arc running from the planar surface at the top of 
the dome down to the white circle at the periphery and press Enter.

Exercise 17.4: Extrude 2D Geometry into 3D
Extruding means pushing forcibly through a die, like hot steel beams being 
extruded at a foundry. In the following steps, you will extrude the boundary 
representing the edge of the dome membrane as a curtain-like wall. In the next 
section, you will use this curtain to trim off the outer portion of the membrane. 
To begin, open Ex17.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Select the Extrude tool on the Create panel of the ribbon’s Surface 
tab. Select the magenta dome edge (see Figure 17.7) and press Enter.

Edit Surface Models
Surface models have editing tools that modify existing surface boundaries. In 
the following sections, you will modify surface boundaries by using other sur-
faces or by projecting edges onto existing surfaces and using these projections 
to modify boundaries or cut holes in surfaces. In addition, you will project 2D 
objects onto 3D surfaces without altering the surfaces at all.
Exercise 17.5: Trim Surfaces with  
Other Surfaces
In the following steps, you will trim off the portion of the dome membrane  
that extends beyond the curtain wall extrusion you generated in the previous 
section. To begin, open Ex17.5-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion 
files.
	
1.	 Switch to the 3D Modeling workspace if it’s not selected already in 
the Quick Access toolbar.

Create Solid Models
If surfaces cover 2D floor spaces, then solid models enclose 3D volumes. Only 
with solid objects can you use the MASSPROP command to calculate engineer-
ing properties such as volume, centroid, moments of inertia, and so on. Many of 
the solid modeling tools are the same as the surface modeling tools. If you start 
these commands with a closed path such as a circle, ellipse, or closed polyline, 
you will end up with a solid object, whereas open paths generate surfaces. In the 
following sections, you’ll extrude and loft solid objects.
Exercise 17.8: Extrude Solid Objects
The difference between a surface extrusion and a solid extrusion is what’s in the 
middle: nothing in the case of the surface model and “mass” in the case of the solid. 
In the next section, you’ll see how to affect the solid “mass” with Boolean tools. In 
the following steps, you’ll extrude a circle into a solid and array it around the dome. 
To begin, open Ex17.8-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.

Edit Solid Models
Solid-editing tools provide an alternative set of modeling possibilities as com-
pared with surface tools. Boolean tools (named after mathematician George 
Boole) allow you to unify, subtract, and intersect solids (set theory terms) to 
create new forms. You will explore these tools in the following section and learn 
about a variety of specialized solid-editing tools.
Exercise 17.10: Perform Boolean  
Operations
In the following steps, you will unify the top and bottom parts of the mast with 
the UNION command. You will then rotate and array 12 masts around the dome. 
To begin, open Ex17.10-start.dwg from the companion files.

Live-Section Models
A section is a cut through a 3D model displaying 2D line work where the model 
and cutting plane intersect. A live section is a dynamic cutting plane that you 
can move in relation to the model, helping you visualize the model’s interior 
with a combination of 2D and 3D geometry. In AutoCAD there are four types of 
live section cuts: plane, slice, boundary, and volume.
Exercise 17.13: Create and Edit a Section Plane
Let’s create a section plane and then move it to see the dynamic feature. To 
begin, open Ex17.13-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Switch to the 3D Modeling workspace if it is not already selected in 
the Quick Access toolbar.
	
2.	 On the ribbon’s Home tab, click the Section Plane tool in the  
Section panel. With Ortho mode on, click points A and B shown in 
Figure 17.34 to create a vertical section plane.

4.	 Open the downward-facing triangular grip and select Slice from the 
context menu that appears. Type 0.5 in the Slice Thickness text box 
in the ribbon’s Adjust panel that appears while you have the Section 
Object selected. A 3D slice is all that is visible of the object (see 
Figure 17.35).
	
5.	 Change the grip menu to Volume and then adjust the top and left 
grips to describe a volume less than the total volume of the object. 
The object is sliced along three planes.
	
6.	 Select the section object, type SECTIONPLANESETTINGS, and 
press Enter. Change the color under Intersection Boundary to Green. 
Under Intersection Fill, change Face Hatch to Predefined/ANSI31 and 
change Hatch Scale to 6. Scroll down; under Cut-Away Geometry, 
change Show to Yes, Color to Red, and Face Transparency to 80. The 
result shows the intersection boundary as a thin green line, the inter-
section fill with a cross-hatch pattern, and the cutaway geometry in 
transparent red (see Figure 17.36). Click OK.

Chapter 18
Presenting and 
Documenting 3D 
Design
Wireframe, hidden line, and shaded views are helpful means of  
visualizing models during the design process. However, visual styles leave 
something to be desired when you are communicating designs to your 
clients. The general public has come to expect designers to be able to 
produce the kind of realistic computer-generated imagery regularly seen 
in movies. This chapter will help you learn to do that by teaching you 
how to create realistic presentation images using the advanced render-
ing system in the AutoCAD® program. After you gain client approval, you 
still need to document your 3D design with relevant 2D plans, elevations, 
sections, and detail drawings so that your design can be communicated 
to the building or manufacturing trades. You will learn how to gener-
ate these drawings directly from models using the model documentation 
features.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to do the following:

Assign Materials
Materials describe the way objects interact with light. AutoCAD comes with an 
extensive library of real-world materials, including numerous types of concrete, 
metal, glass, brick, paint, leather, carpet, plastic, and so on. In the following 
steps, you will transfer materials from the Autodesk library to a sample model 
and then assign them to objects layer by layer.
Exercise 18.1: Apply Materials
Begin by opening the file Ex18.1-start.dwg, which is among the companion 
files available for download from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/

Place and Adjust Lights
Without light, nothing would be visible. AutoCAD uses what is called default light-
ing to illuminate objects in the viewport while you are building 3D models. The 
default lights are positioned behind the viewer and emit even illumination so that 
you can always see what is in the viewport. However, default lighting is not real-
istic and must be turned off as soon as you create artificial or natural light. You 
will add artificial lights (a series of spotlights mounted in the ceiling) and natural 
lights simulating the sun and sky light diffused throughout the atmosphere.
Exercise 18.2: Add Artificial Lights
In the real world, artificial lights are electrical lighting fixtures that are one of 
the hallmarks of the modern world. In AutoCAD, artificial lights include point, 
spot, and direct sources. Point sources illuminate in all directions, spot sources 
illuminate in a cone, and direct lights simulate light coming evenly from  
a particular direction, illuminating everything like the sun.
AutoCAD has two different lighting methods: standard and photometric. 
Standard lights were used before AutoCAD 2008, and they are still available 
F i g u r e   1 8 . 5   Using the realistic visual style to display materials’ texture maps
The absolute size of the 
model matters when 
you are using photo-
metric lights. Natural 
light can easily over-
power artificial light in 
terms of intensity.

so that lights in older DWG files will still be compatible in the current 
version.
However, I strongly urge you to use photometric lights, which are much more 
realistic. Photometric lights use real-world lighting intensity values (in American 
or International lighting units), and light coming from photometric light decays 
with the inverse square of distance, just like light does in the real world.
In the following steps, first you will change lighting units to turn on the  
photometric lighting system, and then you will add a series of artificial lights to 
illuminate an architectural interior. To begin, open Ex18.2-start.dwg from 
this chapter’s companion files.
	
1.	 Switch to the 3D Modeling workspace if it’s not selected already in 
the Quick Access toolbar.
	
2.	 Select the ribbon’s Visualize tab and expand the Lights panel. Open 
the Generic Lighting Units menu (used only for the standard lighting  
method) and select American Lighting Units (or International 
Lighting Units in metric).
	
3.	 Click the word Top in the ViewCube® to switch to a floor plan view. 
Rotate the view clockwise so that North is up. Choose Zoom Extents 
in the Navigation bar and switch to the Wireframe visual style using 
the in-canvas control.
	
4.	 Select the ribbon’s Home tab and expand the Layers panel. Select the 
Turn All Layers On tool. Light fixtures (down lights) are visible in the 
viewport (see Figure 18.6).
	
5.	 Zoom in on the upper-left light by turning the mouse wheel forward. 
Do the following:
▶
▶If you’re a Windows user, select the ribbon’s Visualize tab and, 
on the Lights panel, open the Create Light menu and select 
Spot.
▶
▶If you’re a Mac user, type LIGHT, press Enter, type S (for Spot), 
and press Enter.
	
6.	 Select Turn Off The Default Lighting when the Lighting – Viewport 
Lighting Mode dialog box appears (see Figure 18.7).
	
7.	 The command prompt reads as follows:
SPOTLIGHT Specify source location <0,0,0>:
Type .xy and press Enter. Click a point visually centered on the 
light fixture (but do not use center object snap).
Point filters such as .xy, 
.xz, and .yz allow you 
to specify the listed 
coordinate values by 
clicking in the drawing. 
Typing the missing 
coordinate then speci-
fies the 3D coordinates.

Exercise 18.3: Simulate Natural Light
AutoCAD can simulate the light of the sun and/or the light scattered in the  
sky by the atmosphere for any location on Earth and for any time of year and 
time of day. In the following steps, you will configure the model to use a simu-
lated sun and sky with specific time and space coordinates. To begin, open 
Ex18.3-start.dwg from the Chapter 18 companion files.
	
1.	 Switch to the 3D Modeling workspace if it’s not selected already in 
the Quick Access toolbar.
	
2.	 Select the ribbon’s Visualize tab if it is not already selected. Click the 
Sun Status toggle in the Sun & Location panel. The sun is on when 
the toggle is highlighted in blue. Choose Keep Exposure Settings in 
the Lighting – Sunlight and Exposure dialog box that appears.
	
3.	 Expand the Sun & Location panel, open the Set Location menu, and 
select From Map. Choose Yes when asked if you want to use online 
map data. In the Geographic Location dialog box that appears, zoom 
into a hypothetical site anywhere in the world you would like. Right-
click the map and choose Drop Marker Here. A red pin appears on the 
map at that location (see Figure 18.13).

Illumination. AutoCAD automatically manages the color of the sky 
and degree of sky illumination based on your chosen time and space 
coordinates.
Your model should now resemble Ex18.3-end.dwg.
Create Renderings
Rendering is the process of converting the geometry, materials, and light-
ing settings into pixels. Rendering can be a time-consuming process because 
it typically requires a lot of computation to perform. There are no rendering 
options in AutoCAD for Mac (just the RENDER command), and the resulting 
rendering quality isn’t as realistic as that available in AutoCAD for Windows, 
where you have many advanced options. AutoCAD has a rendering engine 
called Rapid RT that produces high-quality imagery with few user-configurable  
parameters.
Exercise 18.4: Make Realistic Renderings in the 
Cloud
In the following steps, you will use AutoCAD’s advanced render settings for 
Windows to progressively create more realistic renderings. To begin, open 
Ex18.4-start.dwg from this chapter’s companion files. Preview render-
ings are free on the Autodesk® A360 cloud-based service. Cloud credits can 
be purchased to render high-resolution images up to 4000×4000 pixels on the 
Autodesk network of servers. Using A360 to render final images can be much 
quicker than rendering locally, even considering time spent uploading the  
drawing and downloading the final rendering, because the job is rendered on a

Making Isometric 
Drawings
Long before the AutoCAD® program existed, architects and engineers 
used isometric projection as a method to visually represent 3D objects on 
2D paper. You can replicate this traditional method in AutoCAD by making 2D  
isometric drawings as a simpler alternative to true 3D modeling (with its 
complex feature set and corresponding learning curve).
One practical advantage of using isometric projection is that you can 
measure any side of an object and it will always be true to scale. In fact, the 
word isometric means “same measure.” The three isometric axes (left, top, 
and right) are equally scaled in isometric and always appear with a common 
120-degree angle between them, as shown in Figure A.1.

The chief limitation of isometric drawings is that they are purely 2D 
illusions drawn on the xy plane, so you cannot ever change your vantage 
point like you can with true 3D models or the illusion will be revealed. 
Figure A.2 depicts a 3D solid cube viewed from the SE Isometric vantage 
point (the UCS icon in the lower left shows the viewing angle with respect to 
the three spatial axes). This 3D cube looks identical to the 2D cube shown in 
Figure A.1.
F i g u r e   A . 2   3D cube viewed from the SE Isometric viewing angle
If you orbit into any custom viewing angle, the isometric illusion drawn 
on the xy plane is revealed. Figure A.3 shows both techniques side by  
side from a custom viewing angle. The isometric illusion on the left is 
blown because its dimensions are distorted, and the 3D model on the right 
is simply depicted from another, equally valid viewing angle. Isometric 
drawings are composed of 2D elements that must always be viewed from 
the Top viewpoint, looking straight down on the xy plane to be valid 3D 
representations.
3D models can be 
shown in perspectives, 
renderings, and 
animations. 3D objects 
have centroids, mass, 
moments of inertia, 
and volume properties, 
and they can be 
exported to other 3D 
programs.
