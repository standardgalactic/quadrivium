Soft in the Head —
YES, IT HAD TO HAPPEN SOME TIME.
Superman has got fed up of doing his
quick change act in the conﬁnes of a
phone box and will now be executing this
incredible feat of contortion inside your
computer. Beyond has recently launched
Superman The Computer Came, which
features Superman, on the side of good,
ﬁghting Darkseid for control of a metro-
polis.
According to Beyond, the game con-
tains a  minimum o f  rules an d  i s
punctuated with breathtaking animated
sequences. It's not a bird or a plane but it
is E9.95.
Also i n  Beyond's autumn release
package were EnigmaForce, the sequel to
Shadowﬁre and Spy vs Spy: The Island
Caper, sequel to Spy vs Spy (as if you
hadn't guessed). Both cost f9.95 on
cassette.
Another superman, international
goalkeeper Ray Clemence. has put his
stamp o f  approval o n  Macmillan
Software's n ew  release World Cup
Soccer. T h e package contains t w o
programs and a  book which provide
information on the skills techniques and
secrets of some of the world's top players.
Goalie Ray commented: "World Cup
Soccer is a must for any serious and
dedicated soccer fan. O n ce you've
mastered this you can sit back and watch
the 1986 World Cup through the eyes of a
real professional."

Feargal and friend Casey tones on computer
by liewson
Domark, meanwhile, has decided to
try and scare us all by launching Friday the
13th, The Computer Game, featuring a
mad ﬁend called Jason who wanders
round a holiday camp trying to get his
homicidal way with all the innocent
campers. Your job is, of course, to save
them but mind you don't panic as this
seems to infuriate the psychopath. 18.95
on cassette and 111.95 on disk, p;obably a
game not to be played in the dark. The
sadist's Terrormo/inos I
Ariolasoft has launched a new range of
software for the autumn which is unusual
because the disk versions are under 110 -
at 19.95. Frank Brunger, marketing and
sales director, said: "The cost may be
lower but the quality certainly isn't." The
Cassette versions are 17.95 and the new
titles are: Axis Assassin, D-Bug, Bug Blitz,
Kaiser and Saucer Attack. All are available
on the CM.

N e w s  411111w
Quicksilva has come up with an arcade
strategy g am e f o r  t h e  6 4  called
Deathwake, which features you as a
brilliant adtiliral trying to rebuild your
shattered forces so that you can destroy
the enemy's special research lab, hidden
in the depths of a mountainside. If you
don't, they will ﬁnish developing the
Ultimate Weapon -  an atomic bomb.
(Hasn't some one already developed it?) If
you want to gain lost territory from the
evil Alliance then you'll have to fork out
17.95 for the privilege.
Ultimate has two new titles for the
C64; Dragon Skulle and Outlaws -
shouldn't that be Autlors? They both cost
19.95 on the C64 and are embellished with
Ultimate's unmistakable brand o f  art
work.
Hewson Consultants want you to let
the train take the strain and buy Southern
Belle for the CM. This steam locomotive
simulator is said by its makers to be for the
more 'sophisticated' game player and it is
rumoured that 'railway enthusiasts have
even been buying computers speciﬁcally
to sample its delight.' Holy smoker
On to more serious software, and
Impex has produced a program called
Font Factory which is aimed at improving
the output from a dot matrix printer. It
reads any standard Commodore ASCII
ﬁle, automatically formats and prints it.
And you get a choice of eight different
typefaces. It incorporates control of line
width and spacing and justiﬁcation. Also
on the disk is a program called Sign Writer
which allows you to produce banners
using letters a foot high. You get both
programs for 119.95.
I mpex has also released Fantastic Filer
and Screen Dumper 64. Both these
programs are 112.95 each and available on
disk only.

MICRONET HAS MOVED ITSELF INTO
the glamorous world of pop music. Feargal
Sharkey appeared on Celebrity Chatline
and was greeted with an  enormous
response from Micronet members.
Feargal has himself been a member of
Micronet for over a year and is very
impressed with the service, saying: "Most
of all I ﬁnd it good relaxation.
loves the Celebrity Chatline in particular.
"I think it's very entertaining." he raved.
"It's certainly a lot more entertaining than
most of the programmes on TV at the
moment. I'd rather watch Chatline than
Coronation Street." Obviously a n
Eastenders fan.
Micronet members have also been
making an effort to help the survivors of
the Mexican earthquake. In  the ﬁrst
montb of the Mexican Aid Appeal they
raised over 1180. Donations should be
made payable to Mexican Aid and sent to
the address below. Micronet members

MORLEY ELECTRONICS HAS N O W
announced the availability of a Teletext
Adapter for the C64. The CM version of
the Adapter plugs into the user expansion
port and uses software to produce a
simulated teletext display.
The Commodore version costs about
E130 an d  anyone interested should
contact Morley for more details.
There's also a new range of colour
monitors now available from Philips.
There are four models in the range and
prices start at WO.
Philips policy is to improve the clarity,

FIREBIRD HAS NOW GOT A BABY SISTER
- or should that be egg. British Telecom is
forming a new software company, which
will be totally separate from Firebird. The
new outﬁt is to be called Rainbird and will
be headed by its namesake Tony Rainbird.
First release from Rainbird is Island
Logic's, The Music System. It has been
available for the BBC computer for some
time, but only now has a Commodore 64
version been perfected.
Rainbird will also be producing soft-
ware for 16 bit computers including
Commodore's latest little offering, the
Amiga. Firebird will continue to burn
brightly and independently producing
games for 8 bit machines.
For those who are confused about the
function of the new Data Protection Act
1984, the Data protection Registrar has
produced a handy question and answer
booklet t o  try and clarify the most
important points. The Act is designed to
protect individuals rights by allowing
them to have access to personal inform-
ation which various organisations may
have on ﬁle. Subjects covered range from
personal data h eld a t  schools and
universities to registration for groups of
companies.
If you're fed up with seeing those
horrible tangled up wires around your
computer t hen Conblock Electrical
Limited may have come up with the
solution to your problem. Now available
are two new adaptors, one of which can
take up to six plugs, the other up to four.
Both a r e  smaller an d  lighter than
traditional ones and they certainly look a
lot better, too.
Both come complete with plugs and
are for use in any standard 13 amp socket.
They also conform to the Electrical Equip-
ment Safety Regulations 1985.

Numeric Variables,
Types and Range
BASIC USES TWO DIFFERENT
types of numbers, integer and
ﬂoating point. A n  integer
number is stored as two bytes
giving a 16 bit signed number
which can store numbers in the
range +3 2 7 6 7  t o  -
Floating point numbers require
ﬁve bytes and can store much
larger values in the range ±
1.70141183 ElB to ± 2.93873588 E
-39. In the Basic interpreter all
calculations, w h e t h e r  o n
integer or ﬂoating point values,
are performed using the latter
rather than simple integers or
binary values. Consequently,
all integer values ar e ﬁrst
converted t o  ﬂoating point
format before any calculations
are performed.
The format for the storage
of an integer value is  very
simple, consisting of two bytes
stored as low order/high order
byte. Negative values a r e
stored in a two's complement
form, — the format is shown in
Figure 1. Floating point values
are stored in  either packed
form, occupying ﬁve bytes, or
unpacked form in  six bytes.
Packed format is the normal
mode for storing ﬂoating point

variables in memory. Unpacked
format is used when perform-
ing calculations upon ﬂoating
point values. In either format
there are three components of
a ﬂoating point value, — the
sign, the exponent and a four
byte mantissa. In packed mode
the sign is stored as bit seven of
the most signiﬁcant byte of the
mantissa. In unpacked format
the sign occupies its own byte,

How a Floating Point
Number is Stored
The storage of a ﬂoating point
number is fairly complex both
in pac k ed a n d  unpac k ed
format. The data used to store a
ﬂoating point number can be
divided into three components;
the exponent, the sign and the
mantissa. I n  t h e  unpacked
format, the exponent and sign
both occupy one byte and the
mantissa f o u r  by tes . T h e
following is an explanation of
each component of a ﬂoating
point number.
Exponent —  T h e  exponent
indicates the position of the
decimal p o in t  w it h in  t h e
number. B i t  seven o f  t h e
exponent byte indicates the
sign of the exponent. Thus, if
the exponent is positive, bit
seven i s  s et t o  o n e  and,
therefore, the value o f  the
exponent byte will always be
greater t h a n  128. I f  t h e
exponent is negative then bit
seven is set to zero and the
exponent value is less than 128.
The exponent is stored as a
power of two and is multiplied
by t h e  mantissa v alue t o
produce the ﬁnal value. The
following formulae c an b e
used to convert a number N
stored in  the mantissa bytes
(see paragraph on mantissa for
calculation of N) into the full
ﬂoating p o in t  number  b y
multiplying it with a positive
exponent:
Value= N • 2 ( E
To determine the exponent
of a number, ﬁnd the highest
power of two which can be
subtracted from the number.
Thus, if the number is 18.256
then the highest power of two
is 16or 2 t4. The exponent value
is positive, a n d  therefore
equals 129+4 or 133. The fact
that the exponent is derived in
this w a y  means  t h a t  t h e
mantissa f o r  t w o  different
values may be the same, with
the difference being registered
solely by the contents of the
exponent. Thus, the ﬂoating
point mantissa contents for the
values 3.14159 (pi) and 6.28318
(pig2) are identical:
3.14159 stored as — exponent
130 and mantissa 73,15,218,161
6_28318 stored as — exponent
131 and mantissa 73,15,218,161
As you can see, multiplying
and dividing a ﬂoating point
number by two is a very simple
operation involving adding or
subtracting o n e  f r o m  t h e
exponent. The range o f  the
exponent i s  I  21128. This
equates approximately t o
10 38.
Sign — The sign of the value is
stored in unpacked — format
as a single byte with a value of
$FF for negative numbers for
$OO for positive numbers. In
packed for mat t h e  s ign is
stored i n  b it  seven o f  the
highest byte of the mantissa. If
bit seven is  zero then t he
mantissa is positive, and if it is
one t h e n  t h e  mantissa i s
negative. Thus the unpacked
ﬂoating point values for +2 and
-2 are:
number +2 is — exponent 130
and mantissa 0,0,0,0
number -2 is — exponent 130
and mantissa 128,0,0,0
Mantissa —  The mantissa is
stored in  four bytes less the
most signiﬁcant bit of the most
signiﬁcant byte of the mantissa
which is used to store the sign
bit. To convert a number stored
in the mantissa into its numeric

equivalent use the following
formulae:
N = 1+(M1 AND 127)+(M2+(M3
+M4/256)/256)/256)/128
where M1,M2,M3 and M4 are
the mantissa bytes, with ,M1 the
highest and M 4  the lowest,
When N has been obtained it
should b e  multiplied b y

actual value. The program in
Program 1 allows the input of a
number, t h e n  pr ints  t h e
contents of the exponent and
mantissa bytes for that number
as it is stored in ﬂoating point.
These values are then used by
lines 90 to 120 to convert the
ﬂoating point byte values back
into the number.
To convert a number into
ﬂoating point form is a slightly
harder calculation and involves
the following steps:
First ﬁnd the highest power of
two which can be subtracted
from the number. E =the value
of two to this highest power.
Secondly let R = the remainder
after subtracting the value of
2 E,
The calculation i s  then as
follows:
TO = (R/E)*128
M1 =  INT(TO)+mantissa sign
(sign =0 if positive 128 if
negative)
Ti = (TO-INT(TO))*256
M2 = INT(T1)
12 = (T1-INT(T1))*256
M3 = INT(T2)
T3 = (T2-INT(T2))*256
M4= INT(T3)
Where Ml.M2,M3,M4 are the
four mantissa byte values, M1
being the highest. The program

Using the Arithmetic
Routines in a Machine
Code Program
Using the arithmetic routines
within the Basic interpreter can
save the programmer a lot of
time in program development,
It can also considerably reduce
the size of  a machine code
program. The only penalty is
that in the program using eight
or 16 bit values the interpreter
routines will have a consider-
ably slower r u n  t ime than
specially wr itten routines .
When faced with the necessity
of having t o  use arithmetic
routines the best procedure is
to always use the interpreter
routines and only replace these
if the program is running too
slow. A  lis t  o f  t h e  main
arithmetic routines within the
C64 is shown in Table 1.
It is quite simple to utilise
the inter pr eter  ar ithmetic
routines within a machine code
program. The essential thing to
r emember  i s  t h a t  t h e
interpreter d o e s  a l l  i t s
calculations on ﬂoating point
numbers, therefore all integer
values must ﬁrst be converted
to ﬂoating point. The following
is an example of a routine using
the inter pr eter  ar ithmetic
routines:
calculation C = (A+22) / (B*5)
Where values A and B are both
positive unsigned 16 bit integer
values these are both input
from the keyboard at the start
of the beginning of the routine
and the result C is a ﬁve byte
ﬂoating point value which is
both stored in  memory and
displayed on the screen.
Variable storage locations in
memory used by this routine
are:
$C000 — Isb of value A
$C001 — msb of value A
$C002 — Isb of value B •
$C003 — msb of value B
$C004 to $C008 — temporary
ﬂoating point value storage 1
SC009 to SCOOD — temporary
ﬂoating point value storage 2
$COOE t o  $C012 —  ﬂoating

his month K Frost
provides a couple of
very handy routines
[for use on all
machines.
HOW OFTEN HAVE Y O U
wanted t o  put a  scrolling
message accross your screen?
You know the type, they are
used in most games programs
to give instructions or a witty
message. The ﬁrst routine does
just this. It is written in Basic but
nevertheless is quite fast and
would be very easy to include
in your own programs as a sub-
routine.
All the routine requires is
that the message to be scrolled
is held in the string AS and the
positioning of the string is held
in D$, i.e. D$ should hold a
home and a number of cursor
movements.
The la in the MiDS state-
ment i s  the width o f  t h e
message window. This can be
any size but don't forget if you
go over 40 the message will
scroll over more than one line
on the screen.
All Things Bright
The second routine is one that
will display a message and ﬂash
the letters of that message in
different colours. This is very
good for messages such as
'PRESS ANY KEY T O  CON-
TINUE' or 'SPACE TO PLAY'.
Again the program is in
Basic and you can easily add it
as a subroutine to your own
programs. The message that
you wish to colour should be
held in the string A$. $ holds all
the colours through which you
wish the letters to cycle. Do
experiment with this as some
very interesting effects can be
achieved.

Eric Doyle shows you
how to foil the
program pinchers.
AFTER SPENDING MANY A
sleepless night and cloistered
day creating and debugging
your latest computer master-
piece, it's  disconcerting t o
know that any Tom, Dick or
Harriette cart r i p  i t  o f f  i n
seconds ﬂat. In the past many
methods have been suggested
to prevent LISTing but few are
satisfactorily secure.
The four  mos t common
methods prevent the list func-
tion from operating properly
but only one of these works
after the program has been
RUN.
Firstly, t h e e  is the simple
expedient of using a shifted 1:
in a REM statement on the ﬁrst
line of your program:
10 REM [S L]
Trying to list to a printer
causes it to hang up after the
REM and the normal command
LIST merely  produces t h e
following:
10 REM
SYNTAX ERROR?
READY
To undo this protection it is
merely a case of deleting line 10
and then the program can be
freely listed by  anyone. Not
very secure.
The second method only
protects one line of a listing
and also uses the protection of
the REM statement. The easiest
way to see this in operation is to
enter a line such as
10 PRINT"HELLO":R
Press the return key to enter
the line and then move the
cursor to the space after the
quotes. Press the shifted delete
key (INST) four times and then
press i t  again f o u r  times
unshifted (DEL). This should
give four  reversed letter T
symbols. Next type GOTO 30
and press return.
If you now LIST the one line
program you should see
10 PRINT"HELLO":GOTO 30
As there is no line 30 an
error message w o u ld  b e
expected b u t  w h e n  t h i s
program is  RUN it  executes
normally with no error. All that
has happened 15 that the REM
part o f  t h e  line has been
masked by the delete symbols
and the GOTO is still seen by
the operating system as being
within a REM statement. When
the system tries to LIST to the
screen t h e  d e le t e s  a r e
executed and this effectively
pulls back the GOTO over the
REM. On a printer the trick is
revealed because each delete is
shown in its original form as a
reversed T.
Instead o f  t h e  intricate
INST/DEL routine, just pressing
RVS ON and the letter T gives
the same effect but with less
ﬁddling about.
Adding more deletes pulls
the GOTO further back along
the line and experimentation
will show that the command
can be p•Ulled back over the
line number and even on to the
previous line.
This is useful because it can
be used in conjunction with
the ﬁrst list protection method
to disguise its presence.
TH
17 PRINT"HELLO"
23 REM147 deletes1100
PRINT""[S LI
This apparently only lists a line
100 on the screen and gives a
SYNTAX ERROR? message, The
false line 100 would succeed in
putting most people off the
scent and using line numbers
which are not divisible by 10
would make deletion of  the
coded lines difﬁcult. O n  a
printer the trick is revealed as
the deletes are shown in their
original form as reversed Ts.
Instead o f  t h e  PRINT
statement in line 17 you could
use a PEEK statement which
looks for the shifted I in line 23.
12
To ﬁnd the location o f  this
character insert the following
line:
17IF PEEK(XXXX) < >204
THEN SYS 64738
Now enter the following in
direct mode (no program line
number)
FOR A=2049 to 5000:IF
PEEK(A)< > 204 THEN
NEXT
EF
When t h e  cursor reappears
type PRINT A and re-enter line
17 with the number obtained
(2140) i n  plac e o f  (XXXX).
Repeat this line somewhere
deep in the rest of your listing
and hide i t  using the next
method o f  p r o t e c t i o n .
Remember that whatever line
number is used for the two
lines at the beginning of the
program, the position of the
shifted I  will not move.
The thir d method takes
advantage of the way a line of
Basic is seen by the operating
system. A line consists of two
bytes which give the memory
address of the start of the next
line, t w o  bytes giv ing t h e
current line number and then
the tokenised code for  the
Basic instructions followed by a
null (zero) byte denoting the
end of the line. When a line is
listed the null byte is used to
tell the system to start a new
line, not the two byte pointer
to the beginning of the next
line. We can fool the system
into jumping to the next line
during a list by inserting a null
byte where it least expects it
causing the list to prematurely
jump to the next line without
listing the Basic code in the
current line.
After writing your program,
decide which line you want to
hide and place any ﬁve letters
at the beginning of the line.
10 SSSSSPRINT"HELLO"
Next insert a STOP at the end of
the previous line or insert a
new line which consists solely
of a STOP command:
5 STOP
10 SSSSSPRINT"HELLO"
RUN the program until the stop
is reached and the familiar
break message is displayed. At
this point the system has stored
the memory location o f  the
next line just in case CONT is
used. locations 61 (S3D) and 62
($3E) contain these pointers so
the start of the line is given by
the f o r mu la  PRINT PEEK
(63)*256+PEEK(64). I n  t h e
example the value would be
2055.
To avoid upsetting the line
link and the line number add
ﬁve to this value and poke the
location g iv e n  w i t h  z e r o
(POKE20600). T h e  d u mmy
STOP command can then be
deleted and a LIST will show
only the line number of the
hidden line whether listed to
the screen or a printer.
For the ﬁnal method of list
protection we need to know a
little about the way in which
the 64's memory is organised.
Locations 768 (S300) t o  '819
($333) mainly consist of jump
vectors for some of the main
ROM routines lik e  LO AD,
SAVE, BREAK and, more im-
portantly, LIST, A vector is a
two byte number which gives
the location of the start of the
in-built machine code routine
which performs the relevant
task. For example, a memory
map gives the LIST vectors as
being in location 774 and 775
($306-4307). Change either of
the values found i n  these
locations and the LIST function
will b e  disabled causing all

manner of things to occur if the
command LIST is used. Insert-
ing a line at the beginning of
your program such as:
10 POK1768,226:POKE769,252
would result in a system reset if
LIST was attempted. Changing
these values to 131 and 164
respectively would apparently
cause nothing to happen.
One word of caution, I'm all
in favour of experimentation
but b e  warned: never play
around with vectors if you have
something valuable i n  t h e
memory, you'll lose it!
All these systems have a
common fault: they are all
easily circumvented o n ce
located. What is needed is a
program which will run auto-
matically and again we need to
look at the vectors in the light
of how the operating system
leaves the LOAD command.
A call is made to the vector
jump at location 770 ($302)
which causes a warm reset of
the system. If  this vector is
changed to cause the newly
loaded program to run we will
have achieved our aim. But
how can this be done?
First we must check that the
memory locations w h ich
deﬁne the start and end of the
program are correctly primed
and that the text pointer is set
to t h e  beginning o f  t h e
program. Fortunately, this can
be done by calling up a routine
in the Basic ROM located at
42585 ($A659) and then a call to
42946 ($A7AE) will cause the
execution of the program. This
means that we have to place a
short routine into the memory
and point t h e warm start
vectors t o  t he start o f  the
routine.
Finding a place to store the
autorun routine can be fraught
with problems because it must
stay in memory to keep the
program re-running.
The cassette buffer must be
avoided in case the program
needs to access the recorder
for any reason. Just below this
buffer are eight consecutive
bytes of free memory which
will house our six byte routine
comfortably:
0334 'SR $A659
0337 RAP SA7AE
Two bytes of the warm start
vector can now point to this
routine and because the warm
start i s  called u p  b y  t h e
RUN/STOP-RESTORE routines
the use of the RUN/STOP key
will result in the program re-
starting from the beginning.
To ensure that the autorun
will work, a wedge, called from
the C H R O U T  vectors a t
806($326), must be placed into
the cassette buffer to alter the
vector at 770($302) at the end of
loading. When the system tries
to print READY, it jumps into
the wedge which changes the
warm start vectors. All of the
memory from 31610 the end of
your Basic program is saved
after t h e CHROUT vectors
have been changed.
Obviously, yo u  cannot
change t h e vector without
using a  machine code SAVE
routine. The one included here
starts off with a Basic program
which stores the details of the
load and save devices and
ﬁlenames. This jumps into a
machine code routine which
loads the program which you
want t o  protect, devises a
suitable loading screen and
places the autorun details in
memory. A  save i s  t hen
performed and a cold reset is
performed allowing you to try
your new autoloading program
out.
The Basic loader program
includes a save routine. To set
up your Stop Thief! master
enter and save the loader
program on a spare tape or
disk. Type in and save the Stop
Thief! Master program and
then load and run the Basic
loader (so that it stores the
program immediately after the
Master program i f  you are
using tape).
When using Stop Thief!,
load the Master program and
run it. This automatically loads
the machine code program.
Although you will receive a
prompt, make sure that the
tape/disk containing t h e
program ready for conversion
is in the recorder/drive.
After loading, suitable
prompts will appear to enable
you to successfully save your
autorun program an d  disk
users should n o t  b e  t o o
concerned about the fact that
the saving screen proclaims
that it is loading the program.
Remember that this screen will
be saved along with your
program and therefore will
become your loading screen.
The results of your labours
will b e  unbreakable Basic
programs...well almost!

THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN
C
•rmotie 6
U R E L L  sales dept.,
Castle Lodge, Castle Green,Taunton TA1 4AB

Steve Carrie adds a
machine disassembler
to the Mach 1
monitor.
IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL GIVE
listings of the MACH 1 monitor
extension and also some infor-
mation on the whole MACH
series of programs.
The extension adds a dis-
assembler t o  t h e  nor mal
monitor commands. When the
Basic program is RUN for the
ﬁrst time, it will patch the dis-
assembler in t o  t h e  normal
monitor code. Note that i t
replaces the 1 command (warm
restart), so you will not be able
to use the warm start facility (a
similar effect can be created by
issuing a G 8200 command).
When you have typed in
and saved the extension listing,
place a  disk containing the
original monitor program in
the d r iv e t h e n  R U N  t h e
program.
First, the extension code is
placed in memory at address
7000 hex. Each line has a
checksurn. I f  a  data error
occurs, the program will print
the number of the line where it
was detected. This checksum
isn't 100% effective since one
error may cancel out another
so be careful!
Next, the original monitor
code is loaded in at its usual
address of 8200 hex. A series of
POKEs patch the extension into
the main code. These changes
are as follows:
1 Change the I command to D
and reset execution vector,
2 A  section o f  code in  the
original monitor which sets the
top of memory is altered to set
at address 7000 hex
3 Alter start-up message vector.
Finally, the whole program
is saved to disk under the name
of NEWMON. When you are
sure that everything works OK,
you can replace the original
MONITOR ﬁle with this new
version.
When the SAVE is  com-
plete. type SYS 64738 to reset
the machine (don't switch the
machine off!) then enter the
monitor w i t h  SYS 33280
(unchanged). In addition to the
usual start-up message, y ou
should see another one similar
to:
MACH1 EXTENSION
VERSION 3,5
(C) OCTOBER 1985 S.D.C.)Y.C.
Now, if you type D  A560
< return >the disassembler
should print out the contents
of one of the ROM routines.
Note that this command auto-
matically sets hex I / 0  mode.
You should note that there
is now about 1K less source
code space for the editor which
still leaves about 30K.
The Monitor l u mp
Table
When I  wr ote t h e  MAC H
series, I decided to put some of
the m o r e  c ommonly  used
routines into the monitor. A
jump table was provided at
address 8200 hex  t o  access
these r outines . Sinc e t h e
monitor is always present, a
program only  had t o  know
where t o  c all t he required
jump. A fair chunk of memory
was saved using this method. In
fact, looking back on it now, a
lot mor e c ould have been
saved.
The names of the routines
and their call addresses are
given below.

A 'SR t o the appropriate
address should be used since
each routine ends with RTS
(except START).
Some are more useful than
others. A  m o r e  detailed
description follows. Note that
TXTPTR is  the CHRGET text
pointer at address 7A hex and
TIB is the terminal input buffer
at address 0200 hex.
START — This simply vectors to
the c ode for  restarting the
monitor. It is a non-returning
routine whic h destroys t h e
6502 system stack. This  i s
normally used by an external
command to return control to
the monitor (see EXTERNAL
COMMANDS). This is also the
address 33280 used by the Basic
start-up call.
SAVE — Save memory to disk.
At entry, TXTPTR must point to
an ASCII string in TIFI which has
the format:
ﬁlename <  addressl >,< ad-
dress2 >
This is the same format as the
monitor S  command. A n y
errors cause a  jump t o  the
error h a n d le r .  O n  e x i t .
TXTPTR points to the end of the
string+1. This routine uses a
logical ﬁle number of 1. Note
that the Basic ROM is switched
out to allow the area A000-BEEF
hex to be saved too.
LOAD — Load from disk. On
entry, TXTPTR points t o  an
ASCII string in TIB with format:
< ﬁlename>
This is the same as the monitor
L command. Any error causes a
jump t o  t he error handler
routine. On exit, TXTPTR= end
of string+1. Uses logical ﬁle 1.
MAME — Parse ﬁlename. On
entry, TXTPTR points t o  an
ASCII string in TIB which re-
presents the ﬁlename. At exit,
registers are as follows:
X - length of ﬁlename string
Y s tar t offset of string in TI
TXTPTR e n d  of string +1
This routine uses spaces as
delimiters. An error is given if
string exceeds 50 characters.
OUTADD — Output a 2-byte
ASCII hex or decimal string. On
entry, Y,X contain the 16-bit
value to be printed. The output
mode ( h e x  o r  d e c ima l)
depends on the ﬂag OUTMOD
(address 0 2 A E  h e x ) .  I f
OUTMOD is  z er o, output
mode is decimal otherwise it is
hex.
OUTBYT —  S i m i l a r  t o
OUTADD except an 8-bit value

in the accumulator is used.
RET -  Simply outputs a cr/If
combination t o  the current
output device.
EVAL -  Evaluation expression.
On entry TXTPTR points to the
start of  the string. The ﬂag
OUTMOD operates i n  t h e
usual way . Errors w i l l  b e
incurred if either the number is
out of range ( 0- - : . n:
illegal characters are found.
Note that this routine also
checks for the apostrophe (')
which puts EVAL into ASCII
mode regardless of OUTMOD.
On exit, TXTPTR points to the
end of the string 4-1,
CHKHEX, CHKNUM, CHKA NU
— These three routines check
the accumulator for an ASCII
hex, numeric or alpha-numeric
character respectively. At exit,
a carry-ﬂag set indicates a valid
character.
NSET -  S e t  ﬁl e n a m e
parameters. On entry TXTPTR
points to the start of a ﬁlename
in 11B. O n  ex it, KERNAL
routine SEINAM (FFBD hex) is
called and TXTPTR = end of
ﬁlename +1.
COPE — Opens disk device 8
error channel 15. No input
parameters. T her e i s  n o
CCLOSE call. A ﬁle close may
be accomplished using t h e
following routine.
IDA St 15 COPEN USES 11.11s115

ROUTINE
Put s im p ly ,  a n  ex ter nal
command is one whose code is
not resident in the MACH1
area. Ex ter nals  n o r ma lly
occupy the area from 9000 to
9FFF hex but may extend up to
CFFF hex if the Basic ROM is
switched out (if you use this
method, remember to switch
the ROM back in before calling
START t o  r e t u r n  t o  t h e
monitor).
When t h e  external has
ﬁnished executing, a  i M P
START allows the monitor to
regain control. The actual call
address of an external is 9000
hex.

ASSEMBLER are externals.
Often, if the external you want
to use has already been called
(it must have been the last
external called), a  G  9000
command w i l l  pr ov ide a
quicker method of execution.
This is because an external
remains resident a fte r
execution i.e. it is not deleted
from memory. This is true until
another external is called or the
F command is used to clear out
this section of memory.
The Macro Processor
Bug
And n o w . . .  t h e  b u g !  I
discovered this while using the
MACH system. I t  will only
affect you if you use the micro
processor on large source ﬁles
containing macro calls.
Basically, when the macro
processor is constructing the
output ﬁle, it uses the available
memory from 0801 to 7CFF hex.
Due t o  a  p r o g r a m m in g
oversight (a nice way of saying I
made a mess) no check is made
to see if this ﬁle is overﬂowing
into the area above 7D00 hex.
The processor w i l l  q u i t e
happily destroy itself!
If the application you are
working on needs no macros
then y ou can leave out the
macro processing altogether
and submit the raw code to the
assembler.
Unfortunately, there is no
easy way  t o  t e ll when a n
overﬂow w i l l  occur. A s  a
guideline, if your source code
occupies more than about 25K
and contains calls to some
really big macros then you may
run into trouble but I  think
about 90'3C, of the time you will
be OK. Sorry about that!
I have tried to make the
MACH system reasonably
versatile b y  inc luding t h e
external command facility. If
anyone has any  comments,
questions o r  ideas o n  t h e
system, I would be glad to hear
about them. Write to Steve
Carrie, do Your Commodore.

[This high speed tape
1
I
Plus/4 will cut down that
1
tedious waiting time. By Nick I
[Hampshire.
A FAST LOADER IS A ROUTINE WHICH
replaces the existing LOAD and allows a
program or data to be loaded from tape at
about 10 times the speed of a normal
LOAD so a tape can be as fast as a disk
drive.
A fast loader is achieved by simply
changing t h e format o f  t h e pulse
sequence stored on the tape to allow a far
greater density of information storage per
inch of tape.
In order to create a fast load program
two routines are needed, Firstly, a fast
LOAD routine. This is a  fairly short
machine code routine loaded at the
beginning of a LOAD operation and auto
run to LOAD the rest of the program
and/or data stored in fast loader format.
The second program required is a routine
to SAVE a program in fast loader format:
the fast SAVE routine.
The ﬁrst major problem t o  b e
overcome in designing a fast loader is how
to store each bit on the tape. Each bit is
stored on tape as a pulse which goes
through a high-low transition (see Figure
1). The length of the total pulse decides
whether the bit is a 1 or O. A short pulse is a
0 and a long pulse is a 1. The bit is ﬂagged
in the interrupt register on the falling
edge of the pulse.
The loader is a machine code program
which runs with the interrupts disabled,
sets a timer between the two lengths, and
when the timer runs out the interrupt
register is checked to see if the pulse came
in or not. If the falling edge of the pulse
generates an interrupt before the timer
runs out then the pulse was a zero, if not,
it was a one. The bits are then rotated into
a byte storage until eight bits have been
read, thereby loading a full byte.
Before any bytes can be read and
stored, the loader must set itself to be in
sync with the bits on the tape. This is done
by writing a string of 0 bits with a single 1
bit at every byte interval. The routine then
tries to align itself by recognising the
value of the byte. An example of a header
byte for aligning would be the value 64,
hex $40 or in binary: 01000000. A series of
these bytes is written as the header. Only
when this byte has been read in and
recognised can the actual program be
read without risk of alignment errors.
The program is stored in different ways
depending o n  h o w  much program
protection is desired. The simplest way of
formatting the ﬁle is to ﬁrst SAVE the two
byte load address followed by the two

byte end address and then the actual ﬁle.
The ﬁnal byte following the end of the ﬁle
is a checksum calculated by the SAVE
routine and it's also calculated during
loading. If the two values are the same,
the LOAD was successful. The routine for
this form of fast loader is given in Program
Fast tape routines — making
them work
Putting the theory into practice to create
the fast LOADER routines is not difﬁcult.
The actual timing for the SAVE routine
was not calculated from any theoretical
formula but was obtained merely by trial
and error. The only guidelines were that
the short pulse should be slightly shorter
than half the long pulse, since the
waveform of the pulse is evened out by
the cassette hardware. The timing value
used by the loader is just shorter than the
time required before the long pulse
reaches its falling edge.
F = FLAG TRIGGERED ON FALLI NG EDGE OF PULSE
The high speed tape routine will SAVE
a Basic program to tape in fast format and
automatically put the fast LOAD routine
into the ﬁlename where it is stored and,
when loaded, will automatically start on
the warm start vector. The routines are
initialised by SYS(15616). A Basic program
can be fast saved by  using the SAVE
command as normal but with a device
number of 7, thus:
SAVE"PROGRAM",7
In addition the fast LOAD also makes
use of the secondary address to auto run a
program, thus;
SAVE"PROGRAM",7,1
This will cause the program to auto run
when loaded back. With both routines,
when a program has been saved using one
of these fast loader SAVE routines it is
unnecesary to LOAD anything before the
program; it will LOAD directly from the
LOAD command.

Margaret Webb goes back to
school and learns about Basic.
BEFORE LAUNCHING FORTH THIS
month a  small confession. I've been
writing this column for several months
now and though my teaching qualiﬁca-
.tions are veriﬁable, the same cannot be
said for  my programming skills. I
therefore decided that it was about time I
rectiﬁed the situation by learning how to
program in Basic. I soon discovered that
this is not as easy as it would seem. The
ﬁrst question is to establish the best
method of learning. Three approaches
immediately spring to mind.
The ﬁrst is to sign up at a local school or
college for night classes. These are
available for a number of languages with a
bias towards BBC Basic. There are a
number of snags however. Night classes
are limited to the older age groups
making them unavailable to youngsters.
They also cost money.
If you want to use this route, you are
constrained by a ﬁxed timetable and term
length. You must also learn what the
teachers choose to teach. Some teachers
have a strange idea as to what material a
student needs. My sister is currently
struggling through the mysteries of binary
and hexadecimal as part of her course on
Basic? If she was learning machine code I
could understand it, but not for Basic. It's
a good idea to ﬁnd a course which offers
some practical work as well as lectures so
that you can get hands on experience with
the help of the teacher.
A second approach is to ﬁnd a home
based course and work through it under
your own steam. The alternatives are
either a correspondence course, if you
can ﬁnd one, or  a  book/software
package. The main drawback with this
method is that if you get stuck, you don't
have anyone to bail you out.
Alternatively, you could ﬁnd a tutor.
There are always knowledgeable
enthusiasts around who would spend
some time passing on information for a
small sum. The problem is ﬁnding them.
Probably the best approach for most
people is to combine the latter two.
This month I  intend to look at a
number of  book/software systems
currently available.
Most of you will have discovered the
lack of help provided when you buy a
Commodore machine. The C-16 does
come with a Basic tutor but this is more of
a sales gimmick. The actual manuals are
next to useless. This is rather strange when
vou consider the tuition provided with
other products. Many manufacturers of
knitting machines and musical instru-
ments provide lessons or other teaching
material included in the price. Why can't
computer manufacturers do it too?
One small word of warning. A large
number of publishers have spotted the
short comings of  the Commodore
manuals and have produced books
teaching Basic and the inner workings of
the computer. Many of these books are
hardly any better than the Commodore
manuals and you should purchase with
care.
As a preliminary guide, I shall describe
a number of packages covering different
age-groups and prices.
Commodore offers a package for the
Vic-20, C64, C-16 and Plus/4 called An
Introduction to Basic. Whilst orginally
sold as a separate package, it has sub-
sequently been offered in the various
Starter Packs. You may be able to locate it
separately if you look hard enough or
contact ,
The package comprises o f  two
cassettes and a book. The manual is set out
as a series of experiments which are
linked to programs on tape. The material
ranges from setting the computer up to
fairly advanced programming. I  was
pleased to see the frequent use of ﬂow
diagrams to demonstrate the operation of
the programs. The approach is structured
so that you must cover the early material
before progressing through the manual.
Overall it's quite a reasonable system
which does its job well enough.
For the younger users, Collins offers a
book entitled DATA LOG. This is a work
book which has the appeal of a simple
approach. Each page gently leads the user
through the maze of  programming,
sprites and sound. The entire book is
written in the form of a space ship's log
with each section or exercise adding to
the scenario. For example using screen
printing and tabulation for the passenger
list, IF...THEN for ticket details and using a
sprite to design the captain's badge. The
material is not covered in great depth but
the book gives a good introduction to the
use of Basic. At 12.95 it's also good value
for money.
Glentop Publishers has a wide range of
teaching books and book/software
packages available for a  number of
Commodore machines. Originally
starting with the Dr Watson series of
books for Basic and machine code,
Glentop moved on to the Watson's Notes
series for the C64. This is a six book series
which deals with most facets of the CEA.
•  s ow
a
The early volumes cover programming in
Basic moving on to graphics in the later
parts. The layout of the material is clear
and tidy and is handled in a logical
manner. If I do have a complaint it is that
the content of the books is perhaps a little
thin. At 12.95 per volume, I would have
expected a little more depth. Notwith-
standing this drawback, the series is well
worth a close look.
Another good quality product from
Glentop is Basic Adventure Part 1. This
book/software package teaches the rudi-
ments of Basic to the seven to 11 age
group. The book takes the form of a
science ﬁction story involving Dr Watson.
Programming concepts are introduced in
small routines which compliment the text.
Overall a novel and effective way of
camouﬂage teaching programming.
Commodore 64 Basic from Wiley is a
meaty introduction to Basic. This is part of
a Self Teaching guide series and uses self
checking and exercises to aid you. The
material covered is much as expected
covering all facets of Basic, graphics and
sound. Flowsheets are used extensively
helping the pupil to develop a logical
approach to programming. The book is
sufﬁciently comprehensive that even
once you have mastered programming in
Basic, there are more advanced areas to
look at. This is exempliﬁed by the section
on databases and data storage on disk and
cassette. The author is clearly American
and this does unfortunately become
apparent in the text with the introduction
of trans-Atlantic colloquialisms. Provided
you can stand the literary style, it's book is
pretty good value albeit a little pricey.
For C-16 owners, Shiva offers the
Gateway to Programming series. This
quartet of books tackles the subject in a
similar manner to the Dr Watson series
by using Sherlock Holmes stories to
illustrate ideas. The text is humorous with
lots of cartoon illustrations. In spite of the
£4.95 price per volume, these are good
value for money and worth a look.
Darning Kindersley produces a Com-
modore 64 Starter Pack consisting of
books one and two of their Screen shots
books and a typing tutor cassette. The
screen shots are full colour pictures of
listings as they appear on the monitor and
illustrations of the results you can expect
from the program. The books step gently
through learning Basic and the cassette
should help you to get to grips with the
keyboard. The boxed set costs 05.95 but
if the price is off-putting each book in the
set can be bought separately.
All of the books described here have
the virtue of using a well thought out
approach to teaching Basic, In addition
most are cheap and almost within pocket
money range.

LK Gibson introduces
I C64 users to 111Q 
I
What is Multi-Tasking?
interrupts.
THIS TERM IS USED TO DES-
cribe a computer that can run
more than one program at any
given t ime,  eac h program
being transparent to the other.
Output to the video monitor or
TV screen is usually split so that
windows ar e formed, each
window being a  miniature
version of the normal screen
for each program. This system
of running programs concur-
rently can either be produced
by hardware or software.
In the examples w e  are
going to consider there are no
windows and the ability to run
two programs is derived purely
from software.
Unfortunately this opera-
tion can only be performed in
machine c o d e  b u t  d o n ' t
despair.. Basic programmers,
the steps to have two programs
up and running simultaneously
are relatively simple and will be
dealt with in  as simple and
concise a manner as possible.
How it Works
The way in which we make a
program run apparently trans-
parent to anything that might
be running is by making use of
the system's IRQ INTERRUPTS,
this interrupt is called 50 times
every second (or once every
jiffy).
When an IRQ occurs your
C64 stops whatever it is doing,
whether it 's  a  Basic o r  a
machine code program and
goes off to carry out its own
little machine code program
Remember, this happens s o
fast that it is transparent to the
system. T he machine code,
executed during an IRQ, is
simply a housekeeping routine
and doesthings like SCAN THE
KEYBOARD; UPAT E T H E
SYSTEM CLOCK etc.
R U T
When an IRQ occurs your
C64 must know where to ﬁnd
this bloc k  o f  housekeeping
code. It ﬁnds an answer from
memory locations 788 and 789
(HEX $0314 & $315). The two
numbers s tor ed i n  thes e
addresses form the INDIRECT
starting address of the house-
keeping code.
You m a y  hav e notic ed
something her e. Me mo r y
locations 788 a n d  789 ar e
situated i n  R A M  and that
means that t h e  information
stored there can be changed at
will. So before the processor
tells the computer to go and do
the housekeeping we redirect
it to do whatever we want it to
do ﬁrst. As you now know, IRO
occurs so times every second so
we now have a program that
runs 50 times every second
irrespective of whatever else
your computer may be doing at
the time. This forms the basis
for r unning a t  leas t t w o
programs concurrently. Now
we shall go on to consider in
more technical terms exactly
how this process is achieved.
As stated earlier, memory
addresses 788 and 789 contain
the INDIRECT address for the
start of the normal INTERRUPT
CODE. Location 788 contains
the low part of the INDIRECT
ADDRESS and 789 forms the
high part o f  the INDIRECT
ADDRESS. T his  method o f
calculating INDIRECT AD D -
RESSES goes for any INDIRECT
ADDRESS u s e d  b y  y o u r
computer, i.e. LOW BYTE/HIGH
BYTE. Therefore, t o  ﬁnd an
actual address, we can use the
formula;
AD=PEEK (x) + PEEK (x+1)*256
Where x  is the ﬁrst location
(LOW BYTE) and x+1 is  the
second location (HIGH BYTE),
i.e. 788 and 789.
Using this formula we can
calculate the actual address of
the s tandard INTERRUPT
CODE with;
A D=PEEK(788)+PEEK(789)*256:
PRINTAD -
This will give the start address
as 59953 (SEA31). Write down
this address as we need to jump
to it at the end of our own
custom routine, if this is not
done the system will not scan
the keyboard and the result will
be a system crash. Therefore
the last instruction in our code
must be;
JMP SEA31
All of this will become quite
clear later on so don't worry if
you're slightly confused at the
moment. The programs given
later are presented in such a
way that they can be used by
the novice computer owner,
but will also form the basis of
some more advanced INTER-

An example o f  this is to

INTERRUPTS e f f e c t iv e ly
splitting the screen using one

second half for your interrupt
code, unfortunately this  i s
beyond t h e  scope o f  this
article.
How to Set up
Interrupts
An ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
program t o  set INTERRUPTS
would go as follows;
$CO20 is where your code
begins and JMP SEA31 is the last
instruction in your program.
This code is fairly standard
for setting u p  any interrupt
driven software, although
some programmers may wish
to carry out some initialisation
for their program during this
setting u p  procedure. T h e
techniques for doing this will
become apparent i n  later
examples.
The routine as it stands will
be s it u a t e d  i n  m e m o r y
addresses 49152 (HEX SC000),
this is a 4K block of RAM sit-
uated above the Basic INTER-
PRETER. This is a convenient
place away from the ravages of
Basic, but almost any RAM
location may be used providing
you don't clash with Basic or
the SYSTEM VARIABLES. Some
useful locations ar e giv en
below, although this list is by
no means complete.
$C000(49152) to  SMF(53347):
This is  t he spare 4K ,
BLOCK situated abov e t h e
Basic INTERPRETER. As it is split
from the normal Basic RAM
(2048-40959) i t  c annot b e
affected by Basic, therefore this
is a n  ideal plac e f o r  o u r
INTERRUPT DRIVEN CODE.

protect this area we must lower
the top of Basic and also lower
the b o t t o m  o f  STRING
STORAGE. T h e  pointers t o

C I S
these are stored at 55-56 for
TOP OF Basic and 51-52 for
BOTTOM OF STRING STOR-
AGE. To protect 256 BYTES for
our interrupt code we would
use the program line;
10 POKE52,PEEK(52)-1:POKE
56,PEEK(56)-1
To increase this  t o  512
BYTES of protected area we
would substitute -2 for-1 in the
above program line and so on
for each 256 BYTES required.
Line 10 as it stands will give
us 256 protected BYTES from
location 40704(S9F01) t o
409591$9FM for our code.
Cassette Buffer 828-1023: This is
the cassette buffer and is totally
safe for disk users but anything
written there w ill b e  over-
written by cassette LOAD and
SAVE operations, therefore
cassette users must b e very
careful when placing code in
this area.
From the above examples it
can be seen that the easiest and
most convenient addresses to
place code are fr om 49152
($C000) onwards, therefore all
the examples given will use
these addresses.
Making it Work
Each example that follows will
be preceded by a description
of the program and will outline
its purpose, this will then be
followed by a Basic program
containing the necessary code
in data statements (this will
allow users without a machine
code monitor to enter and run
the programs given). Next will
be given an assembly listing
(for those amongst you with
machine code monitors) and
ﬁnally each example will be
annotated to show you how it
works.
Fuzzy Border
The following program is the
shortest example that I could
think of. Although it doesn't
really serve any  practical
purpose it does give dramatic
example of how INTERRUPT
DRIVEN CODE works. When
this program is complete you
will see no difference to the 64
screen but the exterior border
will be ﬂashing dramatically,
and will continue to do so even
while you enter or load and run
other programs.
Note that all these examples
can be switched off by using
the RUN/STOP and RESTORE
keys together.
Basic Program 1
This is  a  complete Basic
program and will automatically
boot the code when run. Type
it in exactly as shown,save it for
security purposes and then run
it and behold!.
Disassembled Listing 1 (with
machine code monitor)
If you try to enter Basic code
once a machine code program
has loaded the chances are you
will get an 'OUT OF MEMORY'
error. There is a Basic BOOT
program at the end o f  this
article that will overcome this
problem.
Hopefully y ou have now

!hat introductory program
wasn't too difﬁcult was it, we'll
move o n  t o  s ome m o r e
practical routines now, so sit
down and prepare yourself to
enter a fascinating sphere of
computer programming.
Using a Vic 1540 Disk
Unit on the C64
If you've seen that bargain
secondhand V ic  1540 Dis k
Drive and had t o pass it up
because y o u  thought y o u
couldn't use it  on your C64
then this routine is for you. The
1540 disk drive will operate
exactly the same as the 1541
when connected to a 64 apart
from one major problem. It
won't load programs without
you ﬁrst blanking o u t  t h e
screen and then opening it up
again w h e n  l o a d i n g  i s
complete. This is very laborious
and there are in fact two ways
of overcoming this problem.
1 Buy a new 1541 ROM chip
from Commodore for E24 and
try to ﬁt it yourself, or pay a
dealer to ﬁt it at extra cost, or
2 Use this routine!
To us e t h e  program F l
blanks the screen and F3 opens
it up again, therefore to load a
program us e t h e  following
procedure;
1 Type LOADHYOUR PROG",8
2 PRESS Fl and HIT RETURN
3 Once the red 'disk in use'
light has extinguished press F3
It's as simple as that!
By the way a more esoteric
way o f  ov er c oming t h e
problem is to blank and open
the screen automatically using
the R AM  LO AD and SAVE
vectors, b u t  again t h a t  is
beyond t h e  scope o f  this
article, sorry.
Basic Program 2
Remember to save program 2
before you execute it!
Once you have saved this
program for getting it back in
the computer and u p  and
r
that for PROGRAM 1.
If you're still with us and
have at least partly understood
the procedure involved for the
programs above, t hen y o u
should by now be starting to
realise some of the weird and
wonderful things that can be
achieved with Interrupt Driven
Code.
We now come to our ﬁnal
program concerning interrupts
and as you would expect it is
also the most complex we have
dealt with to date.
Deﬁned Function Keys
This program gives us deﬁned
function keys, the keys are
deﬁned as follows:
F1Change border colour. This
will step through each of the 15
possible colours individually.
F3=Change screen colour. This
will step through each of the 15
possible screen colours i n -
dividually.
F5=Repeat keys toggle. This will
toggle between all keys repeat
and cursor keys only repeat.
F7=Processor pacer. This allows
Basic programs to be stopped
in mid run and allows for easy
de-bugging and also a freeze
frame facility. It also works with
program listings to allow easier
reading. Please n o t e this
should also work with most

m c  programs providing: They T h i s  is by no means the most

Please remember all of the
above programs, especially the
ﬁnal one were not written with
either speed or memory usage
as their main criteria, but above
all they were to be simple and
concise mak ing legibilit y
easier. There are always various
ways to solve most program-
ming problems and the ones
given were not necessarily the
best solutions.
All of the assembly listings
where produced on Supersofes
Mikro assembler cartridge on
the C64. Some assemblers may
use slightly different assembler
command codes. Conversion
to these assemblers should be
little or no problem due to the
fact that the assembly listings
are fully annotated. Of course
should y ou have the Mik ro
cartridge you should have no
problems at all.
Assembler Listing
Loader Programs
As was mentioned earlier, if the
as s embled v e r s io n s  o f
35
programs i n  this  article are
loaded using
LOAD "PROGRAM NAME",8,1
Then any attempt t o load a
Basic program will fail and give
the Error OUT OF MEMORY.
The best way to overcome this
is by way of a small program
called a BOOT PROGRAM an
example of which is now given
below;
Tape Boot Program
10 IF A THEN 30
20 A=A+1:LOAD"INTERRUPT

30 SYS 49152:NEW (OR SEE

Note
Instead of NEW which will wipe
out the Basic Loader and leave
the Interrupt Code running, a
Basic program (y our Basic
Program) could continue from
here o f  which the Interrupt
Program forms an integral part.
Any of the programs that
Load with 8,1 at the end (this
is called a Relocated Load) will
work using the above Boot
programs. Remember  t h e
value for  the SYS command
may have t o  b e altered t o
accommodate different code
entry points.
A Little Utility
The program listed below is
entirely in Basic and provides a
useful facility. Should you ever
come across a machine code
program, whether it's one you
have written yourself (and have
forgotten the SYS entry point)
or one written by somebody
else, then this is for you. It can
be LOADed using the 8,1 or the
1,1 sufﬁx but how do you know
where it resides in memory and
what value do you use with the
SYS command to activate it?
Worry n o t ,  t h is  pr ogr am
automatically Loads and Acti-
vates almost any machine code
Program. The only programs
will not activate are ones where
the code entry point is not at
the actual beginning o f  the
machine c o d e  Pr ogr am.
Although it  will still tell you
where the Program resides so
you can use a Monitor to ﬁnd
that out for yourself. Try it out
on the programs contained in
this article, they will all work.
The utility is listed below and is
called General BOOTstrap.
The Program
We have now reached the end
of this article, hopefully with a
better understanding of how
our computer works parti-
cularly IRQ Interrupts.

Flippo ﬂips over Ancipital and
gets hammered at chess.
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'SBEEN A HELL OF
a month! I  topped my high score on
Anticipital (shuddup! It's a good game,
actually!), ﬁnally found a  good chess
game that doesn't bore the pants off me,
and not only that I've got a stack of
hints'n'tips that'll knock yer eyes off!
'Cip it and See
OK, here goes. Ancipital is not really a
new game, I admit that. But it's certainly
one of Jeﬂy Minter's best. I get a bit tired
of most o f  his other stuff; the early
ouen'out shooty ups are ﬁne for a few
moments, but quickly pall in the end. The
experimental Mama Llama makes my
wrist hurt, and I ﬁnd it more than a little
bit frustrating, having a  Killdroid
careering all over the screen totally out of
conscious control. (P'raps you should use
the Force? — Ed.) Very funny!
Where was I? Oh, yes. Ancipital, or just
plain 'Cippy to afﬁcionados, is a true
original. Four way gravity, a really off the
wall objective, and a good slant on Jeff's
alternative Universe. I like that. I think
games which have a background story are
more fun to play. You know, a little
something to read before you power up
the game, to get you into the feel of the
story. That's where Elite scored very
highly in my estimations, and that's in the
little sci-ﬁ book you get with the package.
Come on, software houses! You're here
to entertain us, so how about it.
What's that? What's my hi-score on
'Cippy? Nah. I' m  too modest. Nah!
Geddaway! Aw, alright, if you must know,
it was 368,805. Pretty good, huh?
Chess Mate
I must tell you about this, Look, I'm not
really known for being a chess player.
Well, actually, I'm rubbish, but I do keep
playing it, despite humiliating defeats to
AcRicirlIAL
k)o-1•611
man and machine alike. I dunno, it's akin
to the fatal fascination some folk have
with car crashes. The best chess game I've
stumbled over recently, in my gluttony for
defeat is Colosuss Chess 2.0. It's so easy to
play; simply moving your pieces using the
cursor, rather than the old long winded
KP3-Kn4 kind of input you have to suffer
in others I could mention. It's a delightful
game, bringing back some of the peace
and quiet of the real game. It beats the
pants off me every time!
Hint Me Daddio!
(Eight to the Bar)
Here are a few tips for your notepad.
Stop me if you've heard any of them
before.
Jet Set Willy: This game drives me
bonkers! I thought I'd seen the last of this
on my monitor, but alas no; the game is
back with new rooms, new challenges,
and not a POKE in sight!, Blast! I still can't
leave it alone though. Shin up the rope in
the Cold Store and you get into the Sewer
System (poo!). Go all the way up the back
stairs to Nomen Luni (Top Of Plane), skip
across to On The Roof, Up On The Battle-
ments and ﬁnally We Must Perform A
Quirkaﬂeeg. (OK, Matthew Smith, I know
you read Furry Freak Brothers Comix!)
Climb up the rope and you'll ﬁnd yourself
in the Watchtower. Get to the top, jump
up, and you'll ﬁnd yourself in the Rocket
Room. Grab the gems at the top of the
Rocket, and off you go, you're in the
Space Station. Once on the Station, ﬁnd
your way to the Transporter, and you'll
ﬁnd yet another new system of rooms.
There's also a guest appearance of a room
from Manic Miner.. .good grief!
Rockfords Riot -  Boulderdash II: On
the ﬁrst screen you have to blast a hole
through a wall by dropping a rock on a
ﬁreﬂy. Then you must clear the earth
under a wall, and then drop rocks onto it.
The wall is Magic. and it will create a gem
for every rock that passes through it!
General tips: The amoebas will create
gems if they are contained by rocks. Try
snatching gems from the side IA piles of
rocks and examine the way the rocks fall.
There's an interesting clue on how to get
seemingly enclosed gems Out by utilising
creative snatching. (Sounds painful, but
never mind!)
More from Rockford next time.
Raves from the Faye File
My current favourite games are Ancipital
(Liamasoft), f o r reasons previously
speciﬁed: Bounty Bob Strikes Back (US
Gold) still my bestest platform game,
beating the pants off Willy, any day;
Summer Games II (Epyx/CBS) if only for
the fencing and the Kayaking; Rescue on
Fractalus (Lucasﬁlm/Activisionl one of
the most state of the art arcade games in
existence, and if Jeff endorses it, then so
do I; Ball Blazer (Lucasﬁlm) probably the
most dizzying 3D game out, fast and
furious; Rupert and the Toymakers Party
(Quicksilva) Ahhhhh! !nit sweet? And
ﬁnally, Rock'n'Bolt (Activison), t o  my
mind, the only new game from these boys
worth a light.
That's Yer Lot!
OK, that's all in the Saga of Yellow Prindle
Walks a Long Way Off and Conquers
Fear of Strange Fruit.. .we have time for
this month. Next time we'll.., well
actually you'd better wait and see, 'cos I
always spill the beans, and what thanks do
I get? None. So off you go and write me a
letter about your high scores. Go on! And
don't turn to the next page until you've
done it!
Hurumph!

Stuart Cooke goes honkers
about Gremlin Graphics
Bounder.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A GAME AR-
rives that you put in your disk drive, play
for ﬁve minutes, think it isn't very good and
put it away. Five minutes later you'll stick
it back i n  the cassette recorder and
suddenly ﬁnd that it's three o'clock in the
morning and you've been playing the
game for hours. Well. Bounder is one of
those games.
Remember the game that you used to
play when you were kids (or maybe you
still do) where you can't step on any of the
lines around the ﬂagstones or the monster
will get you? Well, Bounder certainly
owes a little of its background to this.
You play the part of a bouncing tennis
ball travelling accross a scrolling path.
Your way is hindered by a large number of
pitfalls. Perhaps the main problem that
you have to overcome is the fact that you
can only land on the paving stones. If you
miss then your tennis ball plummets to the
ground a long way below you. I'm not
quite sure why the path is ﬂoating above
ground, but you can't knock the pro-
grammer for a lack of artistic licence.
Large gaps i n  the paving can b e
bounced across by means of the super
bouncers. These are paving stones which
have an arrow on them and give your ball
that extra power it needs to bridge the
gap.
Large walls block your path so you
must guide your ball around them. In the
meantime ﬁlen on hangliders and ﬂoating
logs are trying to stop your progress.
If (or when) you manage to reach the
end of a level you'll ﬁnd the goal awaiting
your ball. If you enter this then you'll ﬁnd
your score increasing.
After each level you'll ﬁnd yourself
entering the bonus screen. This consists of
a number of paving stones with question
marks. Landing o n  a  question mark
increases your score. Be warned you only
have a limited number of jumps in which
to increase your score. Extremely boring
but it certainly bumps up your points.
Scattered around each of the levels
you will ﬁnd a number of mystery paving
stones. These bare the same mark as those
on the bonus level but will not always give
you more points. If you are lucky then you
will gain extra jumps for use on the bonus
level, extra points o r  extra balls. I f
however you are unlucky you will ﬁnd
he mon
your ball being chomped to death by a
mouth or even punctured by a ﬂying dart.
The hazards become more severe the
further you get into the game. Missiles are
launched from the sea, man (ball?) traps
suddenly appear and burst your ball, a
plethora of ﬂying beasties get in your way,
even some of the paving stones disappear
from beneath you. In fact it seems that
everything is out to prevent you from
reaching the goal and bonus level.
A superb tune sets the atmosphere for
your travels along the pathway. The
graphics c roll excellently and your ball
spins as though it has just left a tennis star's
racquet.
As a bonus an extra game, Metabolis, is
being given away free with Bounder.
Metabolis is a conversion of an earlier
Spectrum game and offers very little
difference from the original.
You play the part of a little bird who is
ﬂying around a vast number of locations
attempting t o  stay away  f r o m  t h e
numerous baddies. Your aim in life is to
collect a number of radioactive pieces
scattered around i n  s ome extremely
inconvenient places.
Mapping t
deﬁnitely a must as you will soon ﬁnd
yourself lost.
Metabolis offers nothing out of the
ordinary and probably wouldn't do too
well as a stand alone game. However
being inc luded i n  a  package w it h
Bounder makes it an excellent purchase.
Bounder is deﬁnitely one of those 'Just
another Go' type of games and a must for
any serious Commodore 64 collection.
Especially when you remember that you
are getting another game thrown in for
the price of one.

Part two of Daryl
Bowers' machine code
arcade game.
IN THIS MONTH'S ARTICLE I
am introduc ing t h e  multi-
purpose interrupt handling
routine and the end o f  the
routine rINIT'. We have also got
some smooth scrolling and
wrap-around! Can y ou bear
the anticipation?
If you look at the source
code listing you will see that
RESTORE1, RESTORE2 and
TABMOV need to be changed,
and lines 1540 and 1550must be
replaced with blank remark
lines. Now on to heavy stuff!
The ﬁrst 40 lines are an
addition to 'INIT'. The section
to set up interrupts is the one
with which we are mainly con-
cerned. Firs t, w e  dis able
interrupts with SEI. If we did
not, and an interrupt occurred
while we were changing the
interrupt vector, the C64 would
probably crash,
Locations $0314 and $0315
hold the two byte address of
the interrupt handling routine.
This normally points to SEA31 -
where the KERNAL takes care
of the keyboard input and
various other 'events'. We shall
replace this with the address of
our own routine -  'HANDLE'.
[his is done in lines 3500 to
3530.
Next w e  enable Raster
Interrupts -  in other words,
when the raster in the monitor
reaches a certain point down
the screen an interrupt will
occur - lines 3540 to 3560,
Locations $D011 and $D012
hold t h e  'ras ter c ompare
value'. If we place a value in
these locations it is stored by
the Vic chip. When the raster
reaches that number of lines
down the screen the Vic chip
will cause an interrupt. $13012
contains the low byte and bit
zero of 5D011 contains the high
bits of this value. We set up the
value o f  t he ﬁrst interrupt
position in lines 3570 - 3610 to
SONE
Having changed all this we
can n o w  enable interrupts
again -  
-
 and ﬁnally we
shall turn off the keyboard -
lines 3630-3650. We do this be-
cause the depression of a key
causes an interrupt when we
don't want one - try removing

these lines and see what
happens!
Lines 3690 to 3710 reduce
the number o f  columns o f
characters on the screen to 38,
by blanking out the ﬁrst and
last. This means that characters
will smoothly scroll o f f  the
edges of the screen; again, try
omitting them and watch the
left hand side.
The end o f  this routine
simply places the data in lines
870 and 880 on to the screen.
Note the 'AND' statements.
These are used because the
assembler converts alpha-
numerics in BYTE statements
into their ASCII values. The C64
screen, however, uses values 64
less than the ASCII equivalent.
These 'AND's, therefore,
remove bits seven and six from
the values t h e  equivalent of '-
64.
Handling Interrupts
The r outine 'HANDLE', i s
designed to be totally portable,
that is, you can use it in any
program. Five tables are used:
4540 SCROLL1 :  this contains
the X smooth scroll value.
4550 RAST2 : the Y positions
where raster interrupts occur.
4560 BORD1 :  t h e  border
colour.
4570 BACK1: the background
colour,
1430 TABMOV : the address of
the scroll routine.
I have allowed six interrupt
positions -  you can add more
or use less -  and it is easily
possible t o  add more tables
deﬁning fur ther  effects; Y
smooth scroll for instance.
Now we know that if any
interrupt occurs the processor
will complete what it is doing
and jump to 'HANDLE'. The
ﬁrst thing we must decide is
whether the interrupt has been
caused by our raster compare
value or by some other source.
This is done in lines 3910 to
3950. When a raster interrupt
occurs, bit zero of $D019 is set
to one. If this is not set we jump
to SEA31 t h e  normal KERNAL
routine. A 1 must be written
back into $D019 to clear the
register, ready for  the next
interrupt (a rather strange way
to do it if you ask me!) in line
3960.
The next dozen lines check
the value in $D012 (the current
raster position) against o u r
table of values, and branches to

address o f  the movement
routine. The effect of this is to
allow 'bands' of characters on
the screen to scroll at different
speeds, in different directions
and with different colours. No
mean feat!
'FININT' simply restores the
registers to their correct values
and returns from the interrupt.
The Scroll Routines
Essentially, a l l  t h e  s c r oll
routines from line 4620 to 5240
are the same, so I will concen-
trate o n  just one o f  them:
'MOVE4'.
The 'band' in area four (the
road) will be moving from right
to left at a rate of two pixels
every interrupt (60th o f  a
second). This is achieved in
lines 4790 to 4800. If it were to

'SCROLL
Next we check to see if we
have scrolled a whole character
- lines 4810 and 4820. If the
value has reached minus one
we replace it with seven (lines
4830 and 4840) and procede to
scroll t h e  characters eight
pixels (one character) to the
left -  lines 4850 to 4920,
'ROADFILL' is the routine
which ﬁlls in  the right-most
character, in this case with the
character which 'falls' off the
left.

[iyntron's Digidrum is loot-
tapping, hand-clapping good,
according to Eric Doyle. —
THE HEART OF A GOOD BAND IS THE
ability of the rhyth Ill section to mark time
with the accuracy of a metronome and it is
not surprising that microchip technology
has developed the rhythm generator as
the ultimate musical timepiece. T he
problem is that, unless you are willing to
pay a  s mall for tune, t h e  c ur r ent
generation of machines has as much soul
as the ticking of a clock. But this appears
to be changing.
Syntron's Digidr um is  a  ﬂex ible
drumkit synthesiser whic h allows for
those little touches of individuality whids
normally differentiate the human from
the mac hine. T her e i s  s ufﬁc ient
programming ﬂexibility to allow changes
in rhythm and variation in style and to
convince the average listener that he is
listening to a syndrum kit played by a
human.
The Digidrum package consists of a set
of disks, containing t h e  composer
software and instrument databases, and a
cartridge which plugs into the user port of
the CEA The cartridge has a standard jack
output for  connection t o  an external
ampliﬁer and a trigger output which can
be used to keep several slave sequenced
synthesisers in time to the beat.
On loading the software, you already
have a  standard dr um k it  o f  seven
instruments: bas e dr um, snaredrum,
three tom toms (large, small and ﬂoor), a
crash cymbal and a hihat. These give a
range of eight sounds in all because the
hihat cymals are classed as two separate
instruments whether open or closed. The
sample programs give an opportunity to
hear how the drumkit sounds and very
impressive it is too, despite the slightly
electronic sound.
The composer program is  in  two
sections. The ﬁrst part allows you t o
compose short drum patterns and the
second permits you to combine these
patterns into complete backing tracks.
There is no facility for printing out either
the patterns or the songs so I found the
best method was to switch from one
section to the next and assemble the song
from each pattern whilst the sound was
fresh in my mind.
The pattern composer will permit 51
different patterns with a length o f  38
beats. This is an arbitrary ﬁgure because
the tempo can be changed over 64 steps
which gives a range from the very, very
stow to the impossibly fast. The instruc-
tions suggest that the mean value is
around 44. The screen display looks like a
familiar musical stave but there are eight
lines instead of the normal ﬁve, each with
a letter corresponding t o  one of  the
instruments.
Tunes are entered by  moving the
arrow cursor along a tessalated vernier
scale at the bottom of the screen until the
correct position is  reached. Then the
letter key corresponding to the chosen
instrument is pressed. The result is that a
symbol appears on the relevant line and
the instrument sound is heard. After a few
notes have been entered, you can listen to
the pattern simply by pressing a function
key.
The number of instruments which can
be sounded at the same beat position is
limited to three. A drummer only has two
hands so the program makes it impossible
for a snaredrum, tom tom and cymbal to
be sounded at the same time but a
snaredrum, cymbal and bass drum can.
The ﬂexibility of this system means that a
respectable and plausible drum solo can
be created using triols, syncopation or any
other device or basic rhythm which takes
your fancy.
Each pattern does not have to be a full
38 beats long it can be foreshortened by
placing an end bar at any position along its
length.
43
Once a  f e w  patterns have been
created they can be combined into a song
using t h e  second program. This  is
extremely simple t o  understand. T he
screen shows several columns which are
tabulated in rows from one to 100. This is
the maximum number of steps which a
song can have but since each step can
consist of the same pattern repeated 100
times it doesn't take an Einstein to work
out that there is room enough for even
the most ambitious project.
Entry of a song is made by selecting the
pattern number and t h e  number o f
repeats which are then displayed on the
song screen. The tune can then be played
in full or part to see how it sounds and if
necessary a pattern can be called up and
trimmed until the fusion is complete.
As in  a word processor, there are
several keys which allow the selection of
blocks of the song which can be copied..
deleted or inserted. Similarly patterns can
be copied from one pattern position to
another so that small changes can be
made to create a new variation to add
interest to the generated rhythm.
There is room for 10 songs which use
the same bank of patterns and these can
be saved to disk for recall when necessary.
In addition to the basic drum kit there
is the option to replace any or all of the
instruments with new ones which range
from the hi-tech syndrum sounds to the
more unusual percussion instruments
such as a metal bar or even a very realistic
hand clap. The limitation is still eight
sounds and only three to a beat.
In the studio it would be ideal for
making d e m o  tapes a n d  t h e  o n ly
complaint I have is the length of time
taken to create the patterns. I did ﬁnd this
stage quite enjoyable, however, giving
plenty of freedom to experiment. For live
performance. Digidrum would only be
practical if all the music used the same
percussion set or the performance was
organised to allow time for loading.
Although there are limitations to live
performances, I  am quite sure that it
won't be long before the strains of Sid
Syntron's scintillating syncopation are
heard in the local pub.

Ian Waugh has been
!Music System.
THERE ARE ALREADY DOZENS O F
music packages available for the C64, all
with t h e i r various strengths an d
weaknesses. Anyone who launches yet
another package must think they have
something pretty special.
Even if your ears turn blue at the mere
mention of a BBC computer, you may well
have heard about island logic's The
Music System which was hailed by music-
minded users as the best thing since
memory expansion boards. The develop-
ment team, System Software, has now
produced a version of The Music System
for the CM and 128 and distribution has
switched to Firebird.
As you might expect, the superiority of
the SID chip immediately gives any
Commodore m u s i c  p ro g ra m  a
tremendous advantage over a simiar one
on the Beet). Not content with this,
System Software has included a MIDI
module which allows access to external
synthesisers.
The Music System (or TMS as it is
usually referred to) was highly regarded
not only for its music features but also for
its use of icons and pull-down menus. The
Commodore version can only enhance
System's programming an d  design
reputation as its use of these features are
not only superbly implemented but they
also make its operation relatively simple.
And with six modules to choose from and
over a hundred functions available from
the keyboard, it needs to be simple. Most
keys perform the same functions in each
module so it's nowhere as near so
daunting a task as it may at ﬁrst appear. A
handy Q u i c k  K e y  G u i d e  h elp s
enormously and you'll ﬁnd after a little
use that the keys fall under your ﬁngers
quite naturally.
Right! Let's take a look at the modules.
These a re  t h e  Editor, Keyboard,
Synthesiser, MIDI, Printer and Linker
whose icons are displayed on the main
menu screen. Each module has a
Command Line running across the top of
the screen from which the pull-down
windows...er...pu l I down. There are four
menus here: Files, Values, Commands
and Info and each is selected by pressing
one of the function keys. The information
given in the Command Line menus differs
from module to module but is similar in
type.
Files controls the loading, saving,
renaming and deletion of ﬁles and only
those relevant to the module you are in
can be accessed from that module. Values
holds such information as key signature,
tempo, octave, volume an d  voice

number. Commands i s  generally
concerned with instructions which affect
the whole or large portions of the piece
such as delete track and clear all tracks. It
is also home for a set of macro commands
such as settting markers, copying sections
to the notepad (more o f  that in  a
moment), adjusting barlines, swapping
and copying envelopes and ﬁlters. etc.
Info displays general information about
the state o f  your composition, f o r
example note storage space and the
names of current music and sound ﬁles.
Moving on to speciﬁc modules, the
one you are likely to use the most is the
Editor. This displays a treble and bass clef
in what is referred to as the Voice Monitor
(VMW). Notes are entered here. The
VMW only shows one voice at a time but
you can ﬂip from one to another at the
press of a key and the bars are always
aligned.
Notes are moved up and down the
staves to select pitch and the note name
and octave is displayed in a small box on
the top right of the screen. Each note can
be assigned a different volume level and
any one of 15 envelopes. The current bar
number is shown and horizontal bars
called barmeters indicate how much has
been recorded on each voice. You can
scroll through the score with ease and
notes can be inserted and deleted at any
point. A full range of accidentals can be
used including double sharps and ﬂats for
the musical intelligentsia and notes can be
turned into triplets and tied although no
44
more than two notes can be tied together
at once.
The program will insert bar lines
automatically if required and you can
insert ﬁrst and second time bars. Another
feature of TMS is the ability to deﬁne loop
sections. When played as part of a tune, a
loop section will keep repeating until the
whole tune has ﬁnished. Each voice can
contain up to 20 different loop sections so
you can quickly select one of a number of
repeating bass o r rhythm patterns to
improvise over or for use in a tune.
If all these features have your mouth
watering and ﬁngers itching it's only fair
to warn you that we're only up to page 25
of the manual. There is lots more to come.
From the Commands menu you can
call up a set of macro commands. These
operate upon a section of a voice which
has previously been marked with two
markers. Macro commands include trans-
position an d  envelope an d  volume
assignment.
Yet another feature is the Notepad.
This is used to store a section of a voice
which can be moved to another part of
the same voice or a different one. It can
also be used to merge two music ﬁles
together and notepad ﬁles can be saved
and loaded like any other although only
one can be held in memory at a time.
If you prefer to tap out tunes on the
Commodore's keys, enter the Keyboard
module. Real-time note entry from
QWERTY keys is not the easiest way of
writing a tune but the Keyboard module

M u s i c  R e v i e w
HEAR
I
THI
helps to make a difﬁcult job as easy as it
can be.  Three voices ar e entered
monophonically w it h  horizontal bar -
meters to show you how much room is
available for each voice and the VtWA' can
be called t o  display the notes. The
Keyboard is entered in practice mode, or
Tinkle as it is called in the manual. Music
and Sound ﬁles can be loaded although
only music ﬁles can be saved from here,
The manual is kind enough to explain that
anything but simple tunes may produce
untidy compositions - and it's right - but
then the Editor module includes a Block
Tidy command to help put right the mess
you make.
The Synthesiser module is where you
come to grips with SID. It must be the
most complete and sophisticated SID chip
editor yet devised. Graphic displays give a
visual indication of SID's parameters and
you can load and play a music ﬁle to hear
the effect of the envelope as you alter it
on a proper tune. The envelope includes
waveform and ﬁlter selection and you can
name each creation for easy reference.
The Synthesiser inc ludes  ex tr a
facilities like sweeping the pulse width,
pitch and ﬁlter without using another
voice - an extra bit of magic.
The MIDI module will be attractive to
a lot of users but let us not forget that a
MIDI interface is  also required. The
program supports the SIEL (179) and the
Passport (MO) interfaces and although it
may work  w it h  others this  is  n o t
guaranteed. Although the concept o f
MIDI was to produce a standard set of
digital information signals, the standards
haven't yet ﬁltered down to MIDI inter-
face manufacturers.
This module is basically a six-track
polyphonic real-time sequencer. I t
records most performance information
but not pitch-bend which cuts off any
• following data. I wonder how this got past
the debugging team. You can set the
tempo. select and delete individual tracks
and pause recording by  pressing the
space bar. There are no channel assign-
ment or editing facilities but it is a rather
excellent extra and TMS is not, after all, a
dedicated MIDI program. A big plus is the
ability to convert MIDI ﬁles to music ﬁles
playable b y  SI D  a n d  v ic e  versa.
Regrettable but rather obviously, any
mutli-part polyphonic pieces are con-
verted in t o  three monophonic lines.
Performance data goes  b u t  v oic e
numbers in  the range one t o 15 are
converted to envelope numbers. You can
use the MIDI module for real-time input
and tidy up the parts later in the Editor.
The Printer module supports Epsom
and Commodore printers and you can
add lyrics to the score, too, providing a
convenient copy of your masterpiece.
Finally, the Linker module is used to
link individual music ﬁles. It is the only
way tempo, k ey  and time signature
changes can be implemented in a single
piece and, of course, it allows mammoth
compositions to play through in total. Up
to 26 ﬁles c an b e  loaded, memory

sequence which can contain up to 99
items. The whole arrangement can then
be saved as one ﬁle for  convenient
reloading and playing although you can't
play this back through the MIDI module.
The 94 page manual is well-produced,
well-written, easy t o  r ead, f u l l  o f
illustrations and a comprehensive index
will lead you to virtually every occurrence
of every aspect of TMS. Umpteen demo
tunes are supplied on the disk with even
more on the other side (a bit naughty,
these reversible disks, aren't they?).
You may have guessed by now, but if
you haven't, here it is: TMS is the ultimate
Commodore music editor for the SID
chip. T he MI D I  module is  a  bonus
although musicians with serious MIDI
requirements w ill need a  dedicated
software package. TMS is easy to use in
spite of its wealth of features and it's fun. If
you are at all interested in making music
with y our  Commodore. I  c an n o t
recommend it too highly.
The Advanced v ers ion o f  T M S
containing all the modules described
above retails for 1.39.95 and is available
only on disk. A smaller version containing
on
modules sells for 117.95 on disk and E14,95
on cassette. What will System produce for
the Amiga?

game should be served with

searing a striking resemblance
to Scott Adams' original adven-
ture games of yesteryear, this
game tries to improve on them
by using graphics, but not to
any success.
Sir Tappin is on a quest to
ﬁnd the Holy Grail. The game
starts off in a Forge where the
player meets a CND nut with a
nuclear powered lamp and a
key. He is able to go west, east,
north, south, u p  o r  down.
When Sir  Tappin has been
squashed by a falling tree or
drowned by ﬂying snot or has
befallen some other tragedy he
restarts his quest in the forge
again.
This value for money game
offers the enthusiast on a tight
budget m a n y  h o u r s  o f
exasperating fun and a large
vocabulary of four letter words.
The writers have left all clues,
instructions and commands of
how to play to the players
imagination o r  previous
experience. Using 'Help' yields
"Yes, you'll need it", "No, I'm
sulking" or just plain "No!".
There are a few original results
for some commands tr y  'quit'
for instance or use 'drop' and
suffer the consequences once
you are carrying the nucleur
powered lamp! I  found the

caught w a n d e r in g  a b o u t
during lesson time, or messing
about generally, h e  will b e
given lines by passing teachers.
If he is clever he will make sure
that someone else is closer to
the teacher when misbehaving
because the blame generally
falls on the nearest boy. If Eric
amasses more than 10,000 lines
he is immediately expelled and
the game starts again.

You play a mere clerk who is
in love with a princess. The

rescue her. To do that, you
must ﬁnd your way through a
maze, ﬁnd certain objects,
overcome the palace guards
and then escape to a boat.
In order to defeat a guard,
you must throw a sword at him
before he throws one at you.
You can only carry one sword
at a time and so you will have to
backtrack a lot. Extra swords
can be found lying about or
you can entice a guard to throw

Recovery of the report does
not end the game because the
shields must be hit again to stop
them ﬂashing. Skillful use of a
catapult can always help with
hitting the shields but this does
run the danger of getting lines.
The screen is a hive of ac-
tivity but it's a pity that more
was not made of the 64's capa-
bilities. A  touc h o f  blatant
sexism creeps in with all of the
characters being male but in

Occasionally, you have to

and believe me it will take you
as many hours to complete this
game. The idea is quite simple-
you have to develop a rather
ugly and stupid ape into a man,
remember Darwin's theory?
Syylk's insectoid people
have enough to worry about
with an attack from reptiloide
so the team has to enlist the
help o f  the insectoid com-
mander. This involves the team
in much frantic searching and

Enigmaforce consists o f
Zark Montor the team leader,
Syylk t h e  s tr ong war r ior ,
Sevrina Mans the markswoman
and locksmith, and last but not
least Maul the combat Droid.
As t h e  team goes fr om
location to location they can
pick up objects which are lying
there but care has to be taken
to ensure that each player's
special skills are catered for.
When t h e  commander has
been located, t h e  reptiloid
zone must be searched for the
only serviceable spacecraft on
the planet. loff is also search-
ing and must be stopped and
captured before Republican

the planet to smithereens.
The activity panel is fairly

time to familiarise yourself with

team member and if the cross-
wire selector is placed over one
of these panels and the ﬁre

You can now use the arrow
icons to dictate a direction for
that character to take or select a
sequence of actions for them to
perform. At ﬁrst it is relatively
simple to use the panel but as
the game progresses and the
action hots up, you have to
keep your wits about you and
your joystick on the move.
Action commands are like
an icon driven version of an

[Curry visited Ian Stewart at
Gremlin Graphics.
THERE'S A LITTLE GREEN MAN ALIVE AND
well and living in Shefﬁeld. This pea-
coloured gremlin has made his home
there since June 1984 and the climate
seems to agree with him.
Gremlin Graphics is a small compact
outﬁt run by the exuberant Ian Stewart
who deﬁnes himself as the inspiration
behind many of his company's products.
Entering the micro industry through
Laskys' ﬁrst computer outlet in Shefﬁeld,
he soon realised that there w ere
opportunities for a bright young man in
this youthful business.
Inspired with this conﬁdence, Ian
opened Shefﬁeld's ﬁrst specialist
computer shop aptly named, Just Micro.
The venture took off and Just Micro did
just ﬁne. It was less than a year later that
the gremlin got into the works.
In t he summer o f  1984, lan and
partner, Kevin Nokburn, took the plunge,
caught the gremlin and stuck him on
some headed notepaper to form Gremlin
Graphics. Once this was done there was
no going back and Wanted: Monty Mole,
Gremlin's ﬁrst game, was launched amid a
blaze of publicity. The miners' strike was
then entering the long and not so hot
summer and the Gremlin Graphics boys
saw the potential o f  Arthur Scargill's
activities as material for a computer game
storyline. Because of its topical content
the game was treated to wide coverage on.
both national television and radio and
became a chart success paving the way for
two subsequent Monty games.
Ian Stewart believes that a  major
reason for Gremlin Graphics's continued
success in the production of popular
games is the connection which is closely
maintained with Just Micro. All Gremlin's
games a r e  extensively tested o n
unsuspecting members of the public who
innocently venture in t o t h e shop.
"Customers are excellent bug ﬁghters."
commented Ian. "Our programmers may
test a  game for days without ﬁnding
anything, then one of the kids will come
across a bug in a few minutes of play."
The Gremlin outﬁt listens very
carefully t o  t h e comments o f  t h e
customers who try out new products. Ian
crisply summed up the Gremlin policy in
this area: "If we don't get the reaction we
want then w e scuttle it!" Simple but
effective.
Many Gremlin game ideas are built up
around a comical central character and
this seems to have become a successful
technique. Names such as Potty Pigeon,
Sam Stoat Safebreaker and Thing on a
Spring come to mind. W e  like to base a
game around a particular character to
stimulate the imagination of the player,"
said Ian. "We tend to concentrate on
arcade games because they give an outlet
to the sense of humour which is a ruling
principle at Gremlin. Wherever I am, I'm
always thinking of new ideas for games."
There a r e  o n ly f o u r f u ll t im e
programmers at Gremlin, other work is
done by about 10 regular freelancers. Pete
Harrap who wrote the original Monty
Mole is now a permanent member of
staff. His association with Ian Stewart
began when his Spectrum broke down
and Just Micro lent him another until it
was repaired. Ian said: "Pete was a
customer in the shop and we realised he
had great programming ability. We lent
him the Spectrum and it just went on from
there." However, Shefﬁeld natives with
defunct computers shouldn't rush round
to try and get a loan of a machine.
The full time programmers at Gremlin
are now collaborating to produce a series
of games based on the popular role-
playing books: The Way of the Tiger. The
books revolve around the adventures of
Avenger, a Ninja warrior. Work on the
series is progressing fast and the ﬁrst part
should be available in February. Although
programmers at Gremlin have always
worked together to a certain extent this is
the ﬁrst project into which the team have
ploughed their joint efforts from its
inception and the co-operation between
them has been extremely successful.
Praising his boys, lan said: "Areas which
need improvement can be sorted out
through collaboration. There's never a
cross word between them." There will be
four games in  the series when it  is
52
GRILLING
completed and they will all tollow a
similar story line to the books.
Another new game, Bounder, features
the incredible antics of a bouncing tennis
ball. It's certainly a different concept for a
game as the ball leaps toward you out of
the screen and then bounces back into
the distance. Gremlin's programmers
have even put spin on it! According to tan
the game comes in a value for money pack
with another game, entitled Metabolis,
on the back of the cassette.
C-16 an d  Plus/4 games a re  an
important part of the Gremlin range and
owners will be pleased to know that
Gremlin has no intention of discontinuing
this commitment t o  these machines.
There are probably around 80,000 C-16
and Plus/4 owners in the country now and
there are very few software houses which
take notice of them. Looking at  the
situation in the cold light of day Ian
remarked: "The less people that produce
games for the C-16 and Plus/4, the better
for Gremlin." A  recently released
compilation contains four games for £995
so the much neglected users can really get
zapping.
Ian obviously believes he's got his
policy right but he stresses the fact that
above all the computer industry is a lot of
fun. "The main strength of Gremlin is the
atmosphere in the ﬁrm. This makes for a
good working situation and consequently
good products." h e remarked almost
drowned out by the zapping noises from
next door and the blare of electronic
music from a neighbouring ofﬁce.
When asked to sum up Gremlin as a
software house, Ian makes the place
sound m o re like a  lunatic asylum.
"Basically we're a barmy lot up here."

I WAS DELIGHTED WHEN THE PROGRAM
System 64 by I A Wolfe appeared in the
August issue of the magazine. I was able to
enter all the addresses of my associates
and it worked well. That is to say until this
week!
I wanted to amend the address of a
colleague who had moved house. So,
using option 2  'Delete Record', I
cancelled the old address and re-entered
the new address on the end of the list of
addresses.
Imagine my disappointment when I
printed out a fresh list of addresses to ﬁnd
that every single address after the one !-
had deleted now had the wrong name. It
appears that the deletion in your program
only erases the name and not the whole
address. I have studied the program listing
but have been unable to amend it. Can
you help?
D W Passmore, Sidmouth
I have typed i n  the Home Accounts
program from your magazine. However I
cannot seem to get it to work.
I have checked my program against
the one printed in the magazine and can't
ﬁnd any errors. I  haven't seen any
corrections printed for this program but
believe that the error is yours and not
mine.
Why don't you check your programs
before you print them in the magazine as
it would no doubt solve many problems?
A Sherwood, Bridlington
Every pos t deliv ered t o  t h e  Yo u r
Commodore ofﬁce is guaranteed to have
quite a large number of letters similar to
the ones above. So it is probably worth
making a few points clear.

•
Every program that we publish in the
magazine is very thoroughly tested before
we print it.
The listings in the magazine are not
typeset in any way. What we actually do is
get a printout of the program which is
then placed on the page as artwork. This
leaves very little chance for errors to
occur.
Obviously er r or s  d o  c r eep i n
sometimes. When they do we always
publish corrections i n  t he magazine.
Corrections don't usually appear in the
next issue of Your Commodore but in one
after that. This is because when one issue
is on sale another is just about ready to be
printed.
Most of the time the errors are made
by the person typing the listing into the
machine. No matter how many times you
check them little errors do slip through. In
order to help you with this we will offer to
send a new computer listing to anyone
having problems with a program if they
send u s  a  s tamped self-addressed
envelope and state clearly what they
require.
In the near future we are hoping to
start a software service where all of the
programs in a particular issue will be
available on cassette but we have no ﬁrm
date for this as yet.
In the meantime a couple of features
that will try to give you some hints about

Going back to the System 64 program.
It appears that the programmer made a
few mistakes when he wrote the program.
He only deletes the name and not the
address. This is done in the Sort routine.
This is the type of mistake that it is not
always possible to spot so please make
sure that you give any programs sent to
the magazine a thorough testing before
you stick them in the post. Anyway here

Too Many Ads?
I am writing to complain about the recent
change which has occurred since the
merging of Your Commodore and Your
64. It has come to my attention that there
has been a substantial increase in the
amount of advertisements, at least 25% in
the December issue. As I subscribe to
your magazine I  am worried that the
amount of advertisements may increase
even further in the future.
I would also like to see in the magazine
an extra page of Flippo (In Arcadia) in
exchange for one less page of Sense of
Adventure, as I feel that Flippo is far more
interesting.
A suggestion I have for your monthly
competition is, perhaps, that you should
ask people to send in the best one line
program or the best game or utility using
no more than 100 linnes since a spot the
difference competition does not involve
the use of a computer in any way.
I hope that the points I have brought
to your attention will help to make your
magazine even more absorbing.
Raymond Webb, Guestling
Thanks for your comments, Raymond. It's
always interesting to ﬁnd out what people
think of the magazine. Your main worry
seems to be concerning advertising. This
varies greatly throughout the year and
tends to rise at Christmas because manu-
facturers want to make the most of the
extra money we all spend. Advertising
forms a large part of our income and it is
therefore essential that we carry a certain
amount in order to keep up the standard
of the magazine as a whole.
As an arcade game fan, we can bring
you some good news. In the near future
we will be taking some more ideas from
Your 64 to improve our arcade coverage.
However, adventure players needn't
worry because, you won't suffer from this
at all.
As f o r  y o u r  c omment o n  o u r
competitions, Raymond. We do try and
run the occasional different one, but the
beauty of a spot the difference compet-
tition is that anyone can enter, and they
needn't h a v e  a n y  k now ledge o f
programming to do so. Since the prizes
are usually games of some sort, then it
seems illogical to set a problem which
only programmers can answer.

[Commodore's Pilot package.
THIS MONTH'S LANGUAGE LAB I S
rather different from those in previous
issues. Presented here is a brief intro-
duction to a language that is very popular
in the educational ﬁeld in America. No,
it's not Logo, but Pilot, and in my opinion,
it would be just as popular if it was given
the amount of attention it deserves. Com-
modore Pilot is the only package which is
being reviewed, and the surprising thing
is that t h e  Commodore version o f
standard Pilot (known as common Pilot)
includes many facilities not found in the
standard.
It is worth pointing out that although
the language is designed to be used by
educators to write interactive educational
programs, it does have its attractions for
the programmer. The reason I say this is
because of pattern matching.
It can be said that the job of a pro-
grammer is to solve the problem at hand.
In educational programs this can be quite
difﬁcult as there is a lot of user input
which has to be interrogated. This is not so

easy, and programmers normally ﬁnd
themselves spending a lot of time writing
routines that interrogate user input. This
can distract them from the job at hand -
i.e. solving the problem!
Pilot incorporates a number of tools
that facilitate the interrogation of user
input, thus leaving the programmer to get
on with the main task. These tools can be
applied to problems associated with string
manipulation and pattern matching.
Pilot — The Language
Pilot is a computer assisted instructional
(CAI) language, which is designed for
teachers t o  pr oduc e educ ational
programs -  courseware as the manual
terms it. The idea behind Pilot is that it
should be easy for teachers to produce
programs that interact with the student on
a question and answer level.
The version which is supplied on disk
will run Common Pilot programs, and do
a lot more since extensions have been
added. These allow for the use of colour,
graphics and sprites. An example is that
text windows may be set up to allow for
questions and answers to be displayed on
different sections of the screen.
Graphics a r e  c ater ed f o r  w i t h
commands to allow lines to be drawn/
plotted as well as ﬁlled in with colour. A
group of sprite and colour commands is
also inc luded, a n d  t h e  extensions
facilitate the use of the advanced features
of the C64.
The syntax of Pilot is very simple. Pilot
instructions consist of several parts. First,
there is a one-letter opcode (of which
there are 20. The opcode is then option-
ally followed by a modiﬁer which changes
the way the opcode is going to be execu-
ted. Conditions can then follow and they
can determine whether the instruction is
to be carried out. This is best described
with an example:
IS(A=5): Correct, the answer is 5.
Here t h e  opc ode T  means  p r in t
something, but the screen is ﬁrst cleared
with the modiﬁer S. The condition is that
the answer A equals ﬁve, and if so the text
in the ﬁeld (everything following the
colon) will be printed.
Unlike Basic, Pilot does not require
strings to be enclosed in quotes. Instead,
the string variable or literal is placed after
the separator. This very simple Pilot
program demonstrates this:
T: This will be printed
This will simply display "This will be
printed" at the current cursor location.
However, a return is also printed after
each occurrence of the T command. It is
possible to 'hold', or keep the cursor on
the same line by using the H modiﬁer.
TH: What is your name
This will display the message, and any
answer will be entered on the same line (it
is important to leave two spaces after the
message).
Pilot Data Types
Maths in Pilot is integer only which is a bit
of a restriction. The range is between
32768 and +32767. Another restriction is
that only 26 variables are allowed for.
Performing calculations is done with
the computer instruction which takes the
form o f  C .  Variables assignment is
performed after  t h e  separator and
printing the values of variables requires a
L character to precede the variable name.
C: A=2+2 — assigns A with 4
C:13=(2+2)*(3+1j — assigns B with 16
T:Here is a sum...
TH:2+2=
C: A=2+2
T:LA
T:There, the answer is LA

P r o g r a m m i n g
;
Strings are handled in a very ﬂexible
way. But, as mentioned Pilot only has 26
variables available so it is not possible to
have a string and a numeric variable of the
same letter.
Before a variable can be used as a
string., it must ﬁrst be dimensioned with its
maximum length. Pilot allows a maximum
string length of 255, and the command
used t o dimension string is D. The $
character is used t o  identify that the
variable is  a  string, b u t  this  is  n o t
absolutely necessary.
D:A$(10)
The computer command is used to
assign a string variable with a value. In this
case, it is necessary to use quotes. When
using t h e  T  command t o  pr int t h e
contents of a string variable a $ character
is used to precede the variable.
D:A$(14)
C:A$="Your Commodore"
T:This magazine is called $A$
The C command is very ﬂexible when
it comes to string assignment. Strings can
be assigned with sub-strings, concati-
nated and so on. Indexing is allowed
which can be used on the source or object
string.
D:A$(18)
D:B$(20)
C:A$="This is funny "
C:BS="He is not very funny"
C:AS(9,3)=B$(11,4)
I:SAS
Would print: "This is very funny".
Concatination is  also possible using
the !I operator.
D: A$(6)
D:B$(7)
D:C$(13)
C:AS,="Hello"
CBS="readers"
C:C$=A$I !B$
I:$C$
Would print: "Hello readers".
Getting user input into the micro is
very simple in Pilot. A pre-deﬁned input
buffer called %a is used to store user
input. It works like this:
T:Hello, who are you?
A:
T:Pleased to meet you $%El
Notice that like ordinary string variables,
the input buffer requires the $ to be
preﬁxed to the buffer name when it is
being printed.
The A is the accept command, and it
can work  w it h  numeric  and string
variables as well as the input buffer
variable:
D:A$(10)
TS:What is your name?
A:$A$
T:And how old are you $A$ ?
A: LB
T:You are LB years old then $A$
The problem with user input is that you
don't always get it  in the format you
wanted. Some people would enter their
names in upper case, some lower, and
some as a mixture of both. This can be a
real headache especially if the input is to
be processed. Pilot provides a problem
command PR that allows input to be
'converted' into a speciﬁed choice. PR:U
will convert all input to upper case, PRA.
to lower and PR:S will strip any input of
spaces. PR:Z will reset the options.
The Clever Stuff
Pattern matching is achieved with the
match command M. Assuming we wanted
to check that the user reads this mag, we
could pose the question and process the
answer using this program:
T:What Commodore magazine do you
read?
M:Your Commodore
A:
Now, if the answer entered was "I read a
magazine called Your Commodore which
I think is great", believe it or not a match
would be made. This is because Pilot does
the hard work  involved in  searching
(called window searching) though the
users input checking to see if there is a
match.
Problems with this are that the user
may enter the answer in upper or lower
case. To still get a match the PR command
would b e  us ed befor e t h e  matc h
command to convert the input.
Match used with the S modiﬁer will
even accept answers that ar e s pelt
incorrectly! The S modiﬁer will accept
an answer even if one letter is wrong, or if
a pair of characters have been reversed -
very handy!
More ﬂexibility is allowed with the •
and & characters when used in the match
command:
M:Comm*clore
This simply means 'accept any letter in
place of the •'. The & means any number
of characters.
Summary
There are many, many other features to
the Pilot language. Jumping, subroutines,
55
multiple choice tests, even hinting is
possible. All these features make Pilot a
very practical t o o l f o r  educational
programming.
The language does suffer in  some
areas though. The restriction o n  the
number and length o f  variables is  a
serious one, as is the lack of ﬂoating point
maths. But these faults are common to the
Pilot standard, and are not unique to
Commodore's implementation.
Even though the language is very
powerful, it is not very hard to learn.
Commodore Pilot has 20 commands with
modiﬁers and because the syntax is very
simple, i t  is  quite possioble t o  write
complex programs in a very short time.
I would strongly recommend Pilot to
anyone who wishes to write programs that
involve processing interactive a nswers.
The features available in the language
enable the programmer to 'get on with
the job'.
Commodore Pilot
Commodore Pilot is  supplied on disk
only, together with a very good 111 page
tutorial/instruction manual. Two versions
of the Pilot interpreter are supplied on
the distribution disk; a  development
version which is used to write, edit and
run Pilot programs, and a run only version
that is identical except programs can only
be loaded and run.
Other ﬁles on the disk include three
demonstration programs, a simple sprite
editor (written i n  Pilot), and a  Pilot
program that enables the user to experi-
ment with sounds on the C64
The actual Pilot package has four
modes of operation. First there is the edit
mode which is used for program creation
and editing. The run mode is for running
the program, and the command mode is
used for  loading, saving and printing
programs. Finally, the immediate mode
(which is  similar t o  Basic's immediate
mode) allows  t h e  programmer t o
experiment with Pilot by trying out Pilot
commands one at a time- This mode is
very handy when learning the language.
Graphics on a 320)(200 grid are catered
for. Points can be plotted and removed,
lines drawn and t he graphics origin
changed. Both text and graphics can be
freely mixed and a split-screen command
allows the screen to be divided between
graphics/text output and prompts/user
input.
Other features include sound, sprites
and user deﬁnable characters, although I
must say that these could have been
implemented in a more friendly way.
Commodore Pilot not only conforms
to the standard common Pilot, but also
includes many new features (some of
which I have mentioned). The package is
an easy one to use which is a blessing.
Highly recommended!

L
A LAMA NUMBER OF GAMES
have been entered f or  the
Programmer of the Year Com-
petition. Spike is certainly an
above average entry. I t  is
deﬁnitely worth the effort of
typing it in.
In the game you ﬁnd your-
self as Spike travelling around a
Power Grid. Hidden some-
where within the grid is your
trusty t=64, Your job is to ﬁnd it
Of course, life isn't easy and
the Sparks brothers are out to
get you. The number of sparks
charging ar ound t h e  g r id
depends on the level at which
you choose to play, there are
nine in all.
Full playing instructions are
included in the game so there is
no point giving them here.
Getting It All In
Spike is in two parts. The ﬁrst
part is in Basic and should be
typed in and saved on to tape
or disk. Make sure you read the
page that tells you all about our
method o f  printing listings
before you start Cl don't want
IFIC)ME1 - Ed).
If you are using a cassette
then mak e s ure t hat  y o u
change the
LOAD "SPIKE",8,1
in line 40 to:
LOAD "SPIKE",1,1
Once you have SAVEd the
Basic you can then tackle the
machine code. Yes, I know that
there's a lot of it but we have
tried t o  make it  as easy as
possible for you.
Elsewhere in this magazine
you w i l l  ﬁn d  t h e  Y o u r
Commodor e Eas y  E n t r y
program. You should type this
in and save on something safe.
You will need this for most of
the machine code programs in
Your Commodore. RUN this
and follow t h e  instructions
with t h e  Easy Entry article,
Don't for get eac h lin e  i s
checked as you type it in and
you can SAVE what you have
entered at any time.

Nick Hampshire brings
you some more
[commands to
improve your Basic.
IN THE LAST FOUR ARTICLES
in this series I have given all the
initialisation an d  w ed g e
routines needed to add extra
commands to the Basic of a CM
computer. I have also given the
code to add 12 new commands
which are;  CTL, APPEND,
CHANGE, D U M P ,  F I N D ,
AUTO, C H A I N ,  DELETE,
RENUMBER, MAT, SORT and
VAR PTR.
This month I am adding a
further eight commands. These
are, CATALOG, DISK, EXEC,
MERGE, GET, PUT, TYPE and
OLD. Seven of the eight are
special disk control commands,
and eight (OLD) is included
since it is called by the other
routines. These disk control
commands ad d  some very
powerful and useful features to
a disk based 64 system and will
save a considerable amount of
programming time.
All eight new commands
require that the wedge and
initialisation code given in the
ﬁrst issue a re  present i n
memory a t  t h e  co rrect
locations, a n d  t h at  t h eir
command names and entry
points are stored in the correct
tables. These eight commands
are independent o f  all the
previously added commands -
except APPEND -  routines
from which are required by the
new routines. Within this
limitation they can be used
without the previously added
code. To ensure that you have
the wedges and new routines
correctly positioned. The Basic
loader at the end of this article
gives the initialisation routines
and all commands.
In next month's issue I will
show how to write and add
your own commands to Basic.
All the programs used in this
series are extracted from the
book Advanced Commodore
64 Basic Revealed b y  Nic k
Hampshire and published by
Collins.
GET
Abbreviated entry: G(shift)E
Affected Basic abbreviations:
None
Token: Hex SEE, SOF, Decimal
238,15
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Either;
different effects in direct mode
and program mode
Purpose: To input an ASCII ﬁle
on disk into memory with line
numbers created from 1000 in
steps of 10. GET will read in ﬁles
created b y the Commodore
assembler and SYSRES_ Each
time is read in until a carriage
return is reached. It  is then
tokenised and entered into
memory as a program line.
Syntax: Direct mode; GET
ﬁlename, d -  where di is the
device number (disk only)
Run mode: as chapter 7 GET
and GET tt
Errors: Illegal device -  if the
device number speciﬁed is less
than eight M i s s i n g  ﬁle
Missing ﬁle name -  if a null
ﬁlename is speciﬁed.
File not found - if the ﬁle does
not exist
Device not present - connected
File open error - if 10 ﬁles are
already open
Disk errors -  at the end, the
disk error channel is read and
displayed.
Use: For editing Commodore
assembler ﬁles or ﬁles for the
use of the EXEC command
Routine entry point: S8ED1
Routine operation: The GET
routine ﬁrst checks whether
the computer is in run mode or
direct. If it is in run mode, then
the Basic version of GET is per-
formed. If in direct mode, the
ﬁle parameters are read in and
62
checked for a null ﬁlename or
the device not being disk. If
these checks are O K ,  t h e
message 'reading' ﬁlename is
displayed an d  t h e  ﬁle i s
opened. Each line is then input
and stored in the input buffer,
tokenised, and entered into
memory until the end of ﬁle
marker i s  reached. T h e
program is then re-chained
and the variable pointers are
sest to the correct values for the
program. Finally the disk error
channel is rad and displayed.

CATALOG
Abbreviation: C(shift)A
Affected Basic abbreviations:
NONE
Token: Hex $EE,S05, Decimal
238,5
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Direct
Purpose: T o  dis play  t h e
directory (CATALOG) of a disk
in drive u n i t  EIGHT. This
comand w i l l  dis play  t h e
directory straight to the screen
without having to load it in.
Users of dual disk drives will be
pleased to note that you can
specify which drive to display
by either a number one or zero
after t h e  command. i f  n o
number i s  speciﬁed, t h e
routine will default t o drive
zero,
Syntax: CATALOG tO or 11
Errors: Syntax error -  if  the
c ommand C A T A L O G  i s
followed by anything but
or nothing.
Disk error message -  after
the CATALOG has been dis-
played, the disk error channel
is read and displayed.
Use: The command is used to
display the directory of a disk,
This can be useful if you have a
program that you wish to save
but need to check if there is
room on the disk or ﬁnd a ﬁle-
name to use. The directory can
be paused when displaying, by
use of the spacebar, and re-
started with any key. Display
can b e  stopped completely
with the STOP key.
Routine entry point: $85B6
Routine operation: On entry,
the routine checks to see if a
drive number is speciﬁed. If no
number is  speciﬁed or zero,
the character '0' is inserted into
the ﬁlename after the I f  it is
a one, t he character '1' is
inserted. Anything else w ill
cause syntax error, The ﬁle is
then opened and each line is
read and displayed ignoring
line links. When the directory is
ﬁnished, the ﬁle is closed and
the disk error channel is read.
Check is the one following str2.

DISK
Abbreviated entry: D(shift)I
Affected Basic abbreviations:
DIM - DIM
Token: Hex SEE,S0A, Decimal
238.10
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Either
Purpose: T o  s end a  dis k
command t o  the disk unit
eight.
Syntax: DISK [string expression]
-where the string expression is:
"SO:TEST" - to scratch the ﬁle
test,
"NO:DISK,00" - to reformat the
entire disk.
The other Syntax is DISK which
will display t h e  dis k  error
message to the screen giving a
message like:
23, READ ERROR,18,01
where 23 is the error number,
18 is the track, 01 is the sector,
and READ ERROR is the error
description.
Errors: Syntax error - if the ﬁrst
character of the command is
not a quote character.
String t o o  lo n g  -  i f  t h e
command is  over 255 bytes
long.
Type mismatch -  if the com-
mand is a number, not a string.
Use: This command is useful in
checking errors created from
disk access by using just DISK
which displays the message. A
Basic equivalent would be:
OPEN 15,8,15
INPUT # 15,E,EMS,T,S
PRINT E", "EMS", "T", "S","
CLOSE 15
Also, f o r  s e n d in g  d i s k
commands such as scratch a ﬁle
etc:
DISK "10"
is equivalent to:
OPEN 15,8,15710"
For disk commands, refer to
the disk user manual
Routine entry point: $8A4D
Routine operation: The DISK
routine c hec k s t o  s ee i f
anything follows the command;
if not the error channel is read
and displayed. If there is text
after t h e  command (which
must start with t h e  quotes
character) the text is read in
and s e n t  i n  t h e  o p e n
command. Before either o f
these t w o  operations  ar e
actioned, the current ﬁle is
closed,

EXEC
Abbreviated entry: E(shift)X
Affected Basic abbreviations:
EXP - EXP
Token: Hex SEE,SOD, Decimal
238:13
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Direct
only
Purpose: To EXECute a text ﬁle
stored on disk. This command
works in conjunction with GET
and PUT.
Syntax: EXEC ﬁlename,d -
where d is the device number
(disk only).
Errors: Illegal device -  if the
device number speciﬁed is less
than eight
Missing ﬁlename -  if a null
ﬁlename is speciﬁed
File not found -  if the ﬁle
does not exist
Device not present -  if  no
disk drive is connected
Too many ﬁles -  if 10 ﬁles
are already open
Disk errors -  at the end, the
disk error channel is read and
displayed.
Use: EXEC can be used in
several different ways. The
main one is to set up function
keys when ﬁrst powered up.
For example enter the
program:
10 CTI.(„5,0,0,1)
20 KEY1,"CATALOG"+CHRS
(13)
30 KEY2,"DISK"+CHR$(13)
40 KEY3,"LIST'+CHR$(13)
50 KEY4,"RUN"+CHRSI13)
60 KEY5,"01.1)"+CHR$(13)
70 KEY67PEEKC
80 KEY7,"RENUMBER"
90 KEY8,"FIND"
100 PRINT CTL(12,12,„,1)
"FUNCTION KEYS DEFINED"
Use the PUT command to write
this to a disk ﬁle: PUT"FK",8
When powered up, type
EXEC"Fir,8 and t h e com-
mands will be carried out and
your function keys will b e
deﬁned.
Other uses could be a string
of change commands t o  a
program.
Routine entry point: S8CCE
Routine operat ion:  T h e
ﬁlename and device number
are read in  and the ﬁle is
opened. Each line is read into
the input buffer until carriage
return is found, I t  is then
tokenised, and executed until
the ﬁle is complete o r an
operating error occurs.

Purpose: T o  merge a  Basic
program from disk into the
current Basic pr ogr am i n
memory.
Syntax: MERGE ﬁlename,d -
where d is the device number
(disk only).
Errors: Illegal device -  if the
device number speciﬁed is less
than eight.
Missing ﬁlename -  if  a null
ﬁlename is speciﬁed.
File not found -  if  the ﬁle
does not exist.
Device not present - if no disk
drive is connected.
File open error -  if 10 ﬁles
are already open.
Disk errors -  at the end, the
disk error channel is read and
displayed.
Use: Merge is used to combine
two Basic programs in memory.
Each line of the program on
disk is read in until the zero
byte is reached, and stored in
the input buffer. The Basic
routine to enter a line is then
called and the line is entered at
the correct place. Note: If a line
number o f  the program t o
MERGE is  t h e  same as  an
existing lin e number, t h e
MERGEd line will replace it.
Routine entry point: $97130
Routine operat ion:  T h e
ﬁlename and device are read in
and c hec k ed f o r  missing
ﬁlename and illegal device. If
both checks are OK, the ﬁle is
opened a n d  t h e  message
MERGING is displayed. Each
line is then read into the input
buffer and entered using the
Basic routine to do so. When
the ﬁle is completed, it is closed
and the disk error channel is
read and displayed.

Purpose: T o restore a  Basic
program after a NEW has been
performed.
Syntax: OLD
Errors: None
Use: OLD can be used if the
program in memory has been
wiped o u t  using t h e  NEW
command. OLD will not work if
DELETE was used to remove the
whole program or if a variable
has been declared since the
NEW. (In most cases, syntax
error will create a variable e.g.
LI instead of L(shift)I will create
the variable LI and give syntax
error instead of trying to list the
program).
Routine entry point: $9885
Routing operation: The ﬁrst
line is scanned until the end
and the pointer to the next line
is restored. The program is then
re-chained a n d  v ar iable
pointers are set.

explains how a
computer can be used
to interpret images.
IN M A N Y AREAS, CO MP-
titers are used to help interpret
images such as that in Figure 1.
The illustration shows a part of
the sky as seen from a powerful
telescope, and computers are
used to process pictures of this
kind to make sense of them in
terms o f  t h e galaxies and
clusters of objects appearing in
them. A similar process takes
place in giving a robot the cap-
ability to see. To be able to
recognise the items that it is to
assemble, f o r instance, an
industrial robot must be able to
interpret the pattern of darker
and lighter dots representing
its ﬁeld of vision as presented
by a video camera. In both
cases, the computer is running
a program that enables it to
bring some kind of order to an
apparently chaotic scene.
There is another area where
computers can be used to help
interpret images, and this is in
archaeology. Often on a site
excavated b y archaeologists,
the only evidence remaining of
a building that once occupied
the site is a pattern of holes in
the ground. After the building
itself has decayed, the holes in
which its supporting timbers
were placed (known as post-
holes) remain. Even for a single
building, which will obviously
have a rectangular plan, the
plan itself is often none too
clear. When many buildings
have occupied a  site a t
different times with some built
over t h e same ground as
earlier, vanished, ones, the
overlapping patterns of holes
can be chaotic. Computers can
be used to good effect in trying
to reconstruct the plans of the
houses that once occupied a
site.
This month's project is to
reconstruct t h e plan o f  a
building from an irregular but
more-or-less rectangular
pattern of post-holes such as
that i n  Figure 2  by super-
imposing an outline of the plan
on it, as shown in Figure 3,

ngure 2 A pattern of post-holes
•
The ﬁrst thing the program
must do is to plot the pattern of
post-holes as in Figure 2. This
can be done by reading the
positions o f  t h e post-holes
from DATA statements and
then plotting a block at each
position to represent a post-
hole. The positions will b e
needed again later in ﬁnding
the plan of the house, so it is
worth storing them in arrays as
they are read. Using arrays
named XP and VP to hold,
respectively, the column and
row positions on the screen for
the post-holes, and making use
of o u r point-plotting sub-
routine, which begins with line
1000, the program starts as:
10 D I M XP(12), YP(12), X(12),
Y(12): NP=12

40 READ C. R: XP(I)=C: YP(I)=R

•
The next step is to ﬁnd the
main axis of the house, by
doing this we shall ﬁnd the
directions of all the walls of the
house. The longer walls will be
parallel t o the axis and the
shorter walls must be at right
angles to it. Figure 4 shows the
idea behind the method for
ﬁnding the main axis. It shows a
line that goes close to the posi-
tions of all the post-holes and a
second line that obviously goes
much farther from most of
them. The ﬁrst represents a
good approximation t o  the
main axis, and the second a
poor one. We shall use a well-

known mathematical method
for ﬁnding the line passing
closest to a set of points, and
this will give us the main axis of
the house. The method is that
of ﬁnding the line giving the
'best least squares ﬁe to a set of
points.
We will write the program
so that it waits until a key is
pressed before going on to
calculate the position of the
main axis and to display it using
our line-drawing subroutine
that starts at line 2000. This gives

With the main axis of the
house plan located, we can
identify t he post-holes that
belong t o  t h e  lo n g  walls
because those on one long wall
will all be more or less the same
distance above it and those on
the other  about t h e  same
distance below it. The remain-
ing post-holes must belong to
the short walls and, broadly
speaking, those to the right of
the centre of the building will
be on one short wall and those
to the left on the other.
By introducing a code for
the walls of the plan, we can
use an array named C to hold a
code number for each point
and so record for each point
the wall to which it belongs.
The code is:
Wall
Long wall
Long wall 2
Short wall 1
Short wall 2
Number
1
2
3
4
Using this code, the assignment
C(1)+4 would mean that post-
hole 1 is on short wall 2.
The next program segment,
also written so as to be initiated
by pressing any key, is:

280 IF YP(K) >  SY/12 THEN
C(K)3
290 IF YP(K) < SY/12 THEN
C(K)=-4
300 NEXT K
After this, not forgetting to
declare the arrays E and C, it
only remains to draw the lines
for each side of the building.
This can be done by using the
subroutine f o r  ﬁnding and
drawing a line four times, once
each time for the points on
each wall. This is done by the
ﬁnal section of the program,
which is:
310 FOR C;w1 TO 4
320 N P=0
330 FOR JI=1 TO 12
340 IF C(J)=Q THEN NP=NP+1:
X(NP)=XP()): Y(NP)=YP(J)
350 NEXT )
360 GOSUB 3000
370 NEXT Q
The complete program for
drawing the plan of a house
from a n  a p p r o x im a t e ly
rectangular pattern o f  post-
holes is  listed i n  Figure 5.
Remember that when it is run it
draws the pattern of post-holes
and then waits for you to press
a key before it draws the main
axis. Then it waits again for you
to press a key before it draws
the walls.
Further Developments
The way to investigate the
capabilities of this program is to
try it out with different sets of
data. Trying several sets will
give a feel for what is meant by
phrases such as 'more or less
rectangular' and 'more or less
the same distance away'. If you
try changing the number 0.7 in
lines 230 and 240 at the same
time, you will ﬁnd that you can
adapt t h e  program t o  deal
successfully with any reason-
able data. The next step, of
course, is  t o  generalise the
program so that it adapts itself
to the data it is given. I think
you will ﬁnd that this program
shows a  degree o f  'intelli-
gence', and if you can make it
adapt it s e lf  t o  d if f e r e n t
situations, you will have made
it more intelligent.

New and Devious...
GLOBAL IS A RELATIVELY NEW NAME
in computer software and i f  the
company's ﬁrst adventure game -  The
Magician's Ball - is anything to go by it will
be worth watching out for in the future. It
is by no means perfect as there are several
anomalies apparent in playing it... but
nevertheless the presentation and the
command structure are good and
sufﬁciently different to make it worth
your attention.
The program is on cassette only and
will run on the C64 (or C128). A fast loader
is incorporated and the program will load
in just over four minutes. The screen
display is colourful and the text easily
read, with the graphic picture of your
location occupying a small rectangle in
the top left corner.
The graphics are not particularly
exciting but are clear and are 'drawn' very
rapidly. Occasional use of sprites adds
some movement that gives a little life to
the scenes. Unlike some games the
pictures, although simple are quite
different and easily give quick visual
recognition to one's location.
The main location description is to the
right of the picture and contains plenty of
information to build quite a fair mental
image of your surroundings. Visible exits
are indicated and input commands are
entered at the bottom of the screen.
The 12 line 'window' between the
description and the command line will
contain additional information on what is
seen at that location - creatures, objects
that can be carried and even what other
creatures are carrying!
Brieﬂy, the storlyine is that an evil
magician has abducted a  beautiful
princess from her father's side; you -Caro
- were there at the time and in a foolish
attempt to rescue the girl, _got swept
away by the magician's magic as he
returned to his own domains. You are
now in the magician's realm and.. .on
your Own!
Input commands may consist of
reasonably complex sentences and also
permit you to tell other characters what to
do. A very interesting feature of this
adventure is  that y ou can swop
personalities and 'control' some of the
other characters you meet in your travels.
T h e
actioned with 'saving' and 'loading' times
of just under two minutes but another
neat trick from Global is the 'Quicksave'
and 'Quickload'. These are implemented
by pressing the Commodore key and
either 'S' or
72
This 'save' option almost instant-
aneously stores your present position into
a protected area of memory. Avery useful
command if you think you are about lobe
killed or even to create a 'fall back'
position if you are not sure of your next
few moves,
Further 'user friendly' options exist in
the input command area - not only can
you delete an unwanted letter by using
the delete key in the normal manner but
you can delete the entire command with
SHIFT and CLR.
Pressing '  repeats the last command
and keying the left arrow key pop left of
the keyboard) recalls the last command
for you to modify if desired. I think it is
facilities such as these that make Global
worth watching in the future. User
friendly games are worth cultivating!
The operating system may be user
friendly, the game is in many ways just
plain devious! All the clues are there but
you may have difﬁculty seeing the wood
for the trees. There are several 'red-
herring paths' and the number of objects
you can carry is not always as great as you
may wish -  perhaps you should get
someone/something to carry them for
you!
Throughout your journey, you travel
to musical accompaniment from 'Tubular
Bells', this provides a pleasant interlude as
you sit back to ponder your next move.
There are the anomalies I mentioned
earlier but these do not alter the game
play in any way - they mainly appear as
various characters saying something that
has no useful or signiﬁcant purpose!
There are also a number of situations
where you will have at one location, two
(or more) items that although different
are similar - a gold and an ornamental
key for instance. It is worth dropping the
one you do not want to use at another
location as the program sometimes ﬁnds it
difﬁcult to understand what you want it to
do!
The Magician's Ball is good fun and
both novice and experienced adventurers
should ﬁnd something in it to enjoy.
Old But Faster
Once upon a time there were no C64s or
C128s. I know that is difﬁcult to believe
but it's true. There were PETs and Ataris
and TSR 80s and quite a number of
programs for them.
Amongst these there were also a
number of adventure games that closely
followed the general idea of Dungeons
and Dragons, with lots of monsters to
meet in battle and treasure to be found by
the bold and daring.
They caught the imagination of
thousands of home computer users in
America (the land of their origin) and
there were even competitions and
conventions where adventurers of like
mind could compete against the clock to
prove their prowess in the worlds of
dungeons and magical tombs.
One of the favourites was called The

a
Temple of Apshai. At that time, with the
exception of the Atari. none of the home
computers had what we could call hi-res
graphics and as it was not written for the
Commodore machines anyway, the
conversion for the PET was sadly lacking.
The graphics showing the rooms and
corridors around your character, took an
age to be 'drawn' to the screen, the action
was slow, the response to your commands
(and there were plenty of options) was
painfully slow and last but not least the
keyboard buffer was not cleared.
This last 'fault' was diabolical, because,
with the slow response to the input
commands (all single key) there was a
high probability that you would press one
or more keys several times trying to either
evade or attack a  monster with the
consequence that your character would
still be striking at the monster long after it
had been slain!
Even a fairly recent conversion for the
C64 still exhibited many of  these
shortcomings making the game tedious
and boring to play. All these half-hearted
attempts were really a  great shame
because the original concept was worth
playing.
I am pleased to report that at long last,
a playable version has appeared for the
C64. This is a new (yet another!) inter-
pretation entirely, with far superior
graphics, faster playing all round, no
keyboard buffer problems and to cap it
all, not only The Temple of Apshai but also
on the same disc, the two additional
adventures that followed: Upper Reaches
of Apsha i and the Curse of Ra'.
The Temple o f  Apshai Trilogy is
produced by Epyx Computer Software
(Impossible Mission, Summer Games etc.)
and is distributed in the UK by US Gold.
One other vital fact is that the three-on-
one-disk will retail for only 9.95!
If you have the slightest inclination
towards 'monster bashing', then these
programs are for you. Even if you are only
barely interested then the Temple Trilogy
is worth considering, purely as being a
classic of its type.
The instruction manual for the trilogy
is some 80 pages long and covers all the
basic rules for playing, together with a
room by room description of the various
locations. The graphics representation
shown on the screen simply depicts a
series of rooms and joining corridors.
It is not absolutely necessary to read
the descriptions but it helps set the scene.
You will also need to refer to the manual
to cross-check against the  various
treasures that you ﬁnd.
The three scenarios provided by the
Temple Trilogy are in many respects
compatible with many non-computer
role playing games. You may even
'convert' an existing character in one of
these to venture forth into Apshal. When
you ﬁrst start playing you are given several
choices.
You may start from scratch, with your
characters given a random rating (from 1-
18) for their six basic attributes: intel-
ligence, intuition, ego, strength, con-
stitution and dexterity, together with a
limited amount of silver pieces with which
to equip themselves.
You may enter a previously 'saved'
character from disk or you may enter the
attributes of a known character from
some other game. Or you may restore a
previous game 'saved' at any point within
Apshai.
Your character is 'named' and is your
own 'persona' within the conﬁnes of the
game. If you start from scratch then you
will have to buy the various pieces of
equipment you think you will need from
the innkeeper.
This is an art in itself as you must learn
to haggle with him to get the best
bargains. Pay the asking price and you will
end up with very little equipment!
Choice o f  equipment is  fairly
important. Various swords are on offer
but if you do not have a great deal of
strength then a two handed sword will tire
you quickly. A small shield may be very
effective if you have high 'dexterity'.
The status screen shown throughout
your adventures in Apshai shows wounds
and fatigue, the lower percentage of
wounds the nearer you are to death. The
lower percentage of fatigue the less
energy you have to ﬁght or run away.
Wounds may be healed over the
passage of time or through the use of
'healing salves or 'elixirs', the former may
be purchased from the innkeeper, the
latter can be found within the rooms and
corridors of Apshal
Fatigue may be restored by moving
very slowly, resting or by ﬁring arrows!
The heavier your equipment or treasure,
then the more fatigued you will become.
Having beaten the innkeeper down in
price and purchased a sword, armour, a
shield, bow, arrows and a few healing
salves, you are ready to enter Apshai. You
have the choice of which realm to explore
and at what level.
Each realm has four levels and for
Dungeons and Dragons followers levels
one to two are appropriate to third level
characters and the lower levels are more
suited to fourth and sixth level characters.
Once you have set out on your present
quest you have a number of commands
available to you. The latest version of the
Trilogy allows for the use of a joystick,
with the four directional movements
giving you 'turn 90 degrees left or right',
move ﬁve feet in the direction you are
facing or rest.
The joystick, with the ﬁre button
depressed, also offers normal attack.
parry, thrust (all out attack) or ﬁre a
normal arrow.
Single key commands from the key-
board also allow you to: move forward
from one to nine feet (keys 1-9), turn to
the left, right or turn about (180degrees),
attack, thrust or parry, ﬁre a normal or a
73
A d v e n t u r e s
magic arrow.
There are also a number of special
commands you may use, such as
examining a  wall for secret doors,
opening doors, searching for  traps.
picking u p  treasures, listening for
monsters, talking to monsters, healing
yourself with salves or elixirs. checking
the inventory of your treasures or saving
the game or character for future use.
As you may now be beginning to
understand, the Temple of Apshli Trilogy
is a little more than a straight-forward
'monster bashing' adventure game. A
little thought is also required if you are to
last any length o f  time within its
dangerous environs.
The option of deﬁning your own
character has got to be double edged. It is
all too easy to give your character 18
points for all attributes. This strikes too
close to, dare one say...cheating?
On t he  other hand, pressing
RUN/STOP RESTORE if the attributes
given• to you by the innkeeper are
particularly poor does give you the
chance to improve on the random attri-
bute system.. after all there are various
magical items to be found that will
increase some if not all of your vital
statistics!
Most levels of  each realm have
between 50 and 60 different rooms, so
there is plenty to explore. Some monsters
are 'tied' to particular locations but there
are also plenty that wander around just
looking for the odd human.
If you choose the right realm and level
it is not too difﬁcult to increase your
experience and treasure but venture
deeper and things become a little more
difﬁcult!
Should the worst happen, then there is
still a chance that all is not lost. If you
come to an untimely end one of four
things may happen, you may get eaten by
a wandering monster.., bye-bye, or you
may be found and resurrected by one of
three 'friends of the dungeon'.
One will do this for no cost. other than
the request of a donation to his holy
order, the other two will extract varying
degrees of payment. So what? You are still
alive and able to add to your valuable
experience.
If you 'save' your character after each
foray into the unknown, you should be
able to gradually build up a better
powerful character. After each return to
the inn, the innkeeper will pay you for any
treasure you have collected and you will
have the chance of adding or improving
your equipment.
Just remember the restrictions that
super heavy weapons and armour place
upon your movement and energy usage.
Also remember that copies of the
poorer version of Temple of Apsahi are

Derek Moody gives
more control to your
ﬁngers with this article
for the C16.
I PURCHASED A C16 AT THE
end of  March but horror of
horrors, here was yet another
Micro supplied with an in-
adequate manual. Commo-
dore suggest that you should
buy t h e i r  Pr ogr ammer 's

needed a  decent keyboard
c ontr ol r o u t i n e ,  s o  I
disassembled the RO M and
starting searching f o r  t h e
necessary information. This
article is based on some of the
results.
The C16 detects keypresses
and stores them, even when
the c o m p u t e r  i s  d o i n g
something else. This is possible
because the keyboard is being
read in an interrupt routine,
this routine also maintains the
real time clock and does a
certain amount o f  house-
keeping f o r  t h e  operating
system. T he I R Q  interrupt
routine is called 60 times each
second, and there are three
points at which it is vectored
through RAM, at $312, $314,
and $316. The vector that will
be of most interest tdus is at
$312, the computer refers to it
after mos t o f  t h e  house-
keeping, but before updating
the real time clock and reading
the keyboard. A vector, by the
way, is an address held in two
bytes of RAM, which points to a
block o f  machine c ode i n
ROM, by altering a vector, the
programmer can cause his own
block o f  c ode t o  b e  used
instead.
The keyboard is read by a
short, 10 byte routine at SDB70
this works b y  wr iting t h e
contents of the accumulator to
the columns of the keyboard
matrix, and reading the rows

back into the accumulator, the
X and Y registers are preserved.
The keyboard matrix i s
shown in Figure 1, to select a
column f o r reading, that
column should be pulled low
by writing a  zero into the
appropriate bit, whilst all the
other columns should be held
high, ie., bit value 1. Therefore
to select column 2, the number
required is, in binary 11111011
or SFEt or decimal 251. If no key
on that column has been
pressed, then t h e number
returned will be 11111111 or
SF F or decimal 255. If, however
any key on that column has
been depressed, then t h e
appropriate bit(s) will be zero,
for example, if both 'C' and 'T'
were pressed, t h e n  t h e
number would be 10101111 or
SAF or decimal 175. To examine
every key, requires the routine
to be called eight times, once
tor each column. T o  detect
whether ANY  key has been
pressed, send a  ze ro t o  all
columns, and if the returned
value is not 255 then one, or
more, keys must be pressed,
although which key(s) will not
be obvious.
The advantage of using this
routine rather than the BASIC
GET and GETKEY statement lies
in the ability to detect and use
multiple keypresses. PROG-
RAM 1  serves as a  useful
example and testbed. When

Figure 3 — Ghost Keys
an on-screen picture of  the
keyboard matrix, if any keys are
held down, then the relevant
matrix position is  indicated,
note that in this case the keys
must b e  held down as the
BASIC routine takes a little over
a second to record the current
position. As the programme is
written, it leaves the operating
system keyscan untouched,
when y o u  h a v e  g o t  t h e
programme running properly,
add the following line.
70 POKE 786,190:P0KE787,252
SAVE this version of the pro-
gramme before you RUN it,
this steals the vector at $312,
and points it to the end of the
inter r upt r o u t i n e ,  t h u s
bypassing the normal keyscan,
and leaving BASIC with noway
of reacting to the keyboard.
The n e w  v er s ion o f  t h e
programme does not recognise
the RUN STOP key, and allows
us to experiment at will.
In PRO G RAM 1 ,  I C %
points top the top left corner of
the matrix as it is printed on the
screen. D%, points to the data

meters are passed to and from

R%, it is used to discover the
state of each bit of It%• C% is the
character poked to the screen
display, it  is  set t o  either a
space, o r  an inverse space
according t o  requirements.
You will notice that two of the
arrow characters, which are not
included i n  t h e  standard
character sets, h a d  t o  b e
concocted from others. If you
inspect the disassembly of the
machine code routine, you will
notice that the parameters are
passed in an inverted form, ie.,
every 1 has been replaced by a
0, and vice versa, this was done
in order to simplify the BASIC
logic, the values passed to the
keyscan routine are correct.
The keyboard is in essence a
set o f  switches that permit
connections between eight
lines  r e p r e s e n t i n g  t h e
columns, a n d  e ig h t  t h a t
represent the rows. By applying
a v oltage t o  o n e  o f  t h e
columns, and searching for a
corresponding voltage on the
rows, then a closed switch can
be detected. For example, if
the space bar is  down, the
voltage applied to column 7
can be detected on row 4, see
FIG 2. So far so good, but we
have a problem, when you ran
PROGRAM 1 y ou may have
noticed that sometimes keys
were indicated as having been
pressed when y ou had not
touched them, why? Look at
FIG 3, on a simple matrix like
this it is possible for switches to
mask each other. If 'C', 'T', and
'M' are pressed together then
'0' is detected as well, go on,
try it! What happens is this,
when a voltage is applied to
column 4, the closed 'M' switch
passes it onto row it
closed ' C '  passes i t  o n t o
column 2, and ﬁnally the closed
passes it onto row 6, where it
is detected by the keyscan, of
course a  voltage applied to
column 4 and detected on row
6 means that '0' has been
pressed, doesn't it?! This
phenomenon w ill not often
cause problems, but it has to be
borne in mind when selecting
control keys for games etc., it
would not do, for instance, if
hyperspace were selected each
time up, left, and the ﬁre keys
were pressed simultaneously.
As a spin off, next time you run
an u n p r o t e c t e d  B A S I C
programme, press 'N', 'M', and
the space bar all together, hey
presto!, RUN STOP!

Let's h a v e  a  pr ac tic al
example, PROGRAM 2 is a two
player game that requires the
detection of eight keys, several
of which might be in use at any
time. Each player has to have
controls for up, down, left, and
right, and in addition we must
permit diagonal movement. To
simplify the input routine, it is
desirable that all of one players
controls should b e  o n  one
column. It so happens that if we
use column 1 for player 1, and
column 5 for player 2, then
there are suitably placed keys
for both players on rows 1, 2, 4,
and 5. The machine code in
PROGRAM 2 is identical to that
in programme 1 ,  and t h e
keyscans ar e made i n  t h e
subroutine at line 500_ This
time, rather than looking at the
whole keyboard by means of
eight column scans, only two
scans are made, and the rest of
the k ey board i s  ignor ed,
however the interrupt vectors
are untouched, RUN STOP still
works.
The programme is  struc-
tured for  clarity rather than
speed, but despite this the
game is quite playable.

When you are designing a game one of the longest jobs is de-
signing the sprites. If you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs.
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterworks
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
t10 for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason), if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot.
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.

'for you with our
'machine code entry
!program.
THE WORST THING ABOUT
Machine Code programming is
entering thousands of numbers
and t h e n ﬁnding that t h e
program will not work. There is
nothing else that you can do
apart from go through all of the
listing try ing t o  locate that
mistyped character w hic h
prevents t he program fr om
working correctly.
Now there's an easier way
to enter your machine code
programs. With the Your Com-
modore machine code entry
program, each line of numbers
is checked as soon as you press
return. I f  you have made a
mistake you will be asked to re-
type t h e  last line. Another
added bonus is that you can
save what you have entered at
any time to tape or disk and
carry on where you left off next
time y o u  c o m e  t o  y o u r
computer.
Using the Loader
Before you type in any machine
code program you must have
typed i n  the machine code
entry program and have i t
saved onto tape or disk. When
you want to enter any of the
machine code programs that
84
are printed out in the form
used by this program you must
LOAD it into your computer.
When you RUN the program
you will be asked for the start
address of the program. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in any machine code listing that
appears before the colon (e.g.
49152* You simply type in this
number and press return.
All that you have to do from
then o n  is  type i n  all t he
numbers on a line. Do not type
any spaces and do not type
return, the program will do all
of that for  you. If you have
made a mistake on any line the
computer will ask you to type
the line again. Once the line is
enter ed c o r r e c t l y  t h e
computer w ill automatically
prompt you for the next line of
data.
Saving and Loading
You cap save your data to tape
or disk at any time by simply
entering the Fl key as the ﬁrst
character on any line. You will
then be asked for the start and
end address of the save. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in t h e  lis ting as  already
mentioned. The end address is
the number of the last line plus
11. Don't forget toadd 11 orthe
last line entered will not be
saved.
To load back a program that
you have saved y ou simply
have to enter the F3 key as the
ﬁrst item on a line. You will
then be asked for the name of
the program.

Dave Crisp takes a look at a
I handy  utility that will allow
you to re-align your disk
drive.
How's Your Disk Drive?
APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S
slow, does it also fail to load some of your
software?
Well, the problem could be head
alignment. That is, the part that moves
over the disk in your drive. Because oft he
two types of metal used in  the head
mechanism high temperatures cause the
metals to expand at different rates. The
result of this is a sloppy head. The answer
to this is to let the drive cool down and
hopefully things will be OK again.
The other cause of mis-alignment is
more serious. Have you noticed with
some protected software the drive makes
a hammering noise like a machine gun?
This nois e is  t h e  mechanism being
'bumped' against the stop. This repeated
hammering w ill eventually knock the
head out of position.
Would other computer owners put up
with a  situation where software can
damage the hardware?
If you are suffering from a badly mis-
aligned head then this software from
Evesham Micros may be the answer,
No Special Equipment
As far as I know this is the ﬁrst disk of ite
type. For the ﬁrst time it is possible to
check a n d  remedy  head alignment
without equipment such as oscilloscopes.
The disk itself has had its  tracks
recorded 'off-line' so that the program
can interpret what i t  reads int o a
measurement.
When I  received the copy of  the
software I was relieved as my head5 were
so mis-aligned that it was getting to a
point where I was ﬁnding it difﬁcult to get
a directory o f  a  disk let alone save
programs with any degree of conﬁdence.
The Tests
There are two main tests:
1 Speed and Clamping test
The speed at which the disk rotates in the
drive is very important and the 1541 exam
shows quickly whether this could be the
ﬁrst of your problems.
The software takes 10 measurements
of your drives speed. This is then con-
verted in t o  a n  average speed. This
average speed should be within -3 to +3 of
300 rpm (1%). If this is OK the difference
between t h e  fastest sample and the
slowest sample is noted and if  this is
greater than 0.6 then this would result in a
failure.
2 Radial Head Alignment
The program reads what data it can from
off-track disk and shows the result on a
chart.
The chart is made up of a display of
asterisks which shows at a glance how far
out your drive head is. The chart will also
show whether the mis-alignment is to the
inside or outside of the track.
In the manual provided there are 14
read-outs-showing results and a remedy
so whatever result you get you should be
able to ﬁnd a chart which looks something
like the one you obtain.
There is a third test which checks the
position of the TRACK 1 STOP.
This is a metal casting which stops the
head moving further back than track one.
It is possible for this casting to become
misplaced which obviously results in the
head mis-aligning with that track.
The program does a stop check and
shows on the chart whether you need to
re-align the stop.
A printout of a chart is shown below.
Doing The Work
If after doing the test you decide that
some work on your drive is required the
86
need
your
head
examined
I
manual will take you through the pro-
cedure step by step. There is not enough
space here to allow me to go through the
procedure b u t  y o u  w o u l d  n e e d
conﬁdence in your ability to poke around
with a  screwdriver without damaging
anything. If in doubt ﬁnd somebody who
feels a little more conﬁdent.
Silence The Gun
You will also ﬁnd in the manual a small
envelope containing t w o  s oft metal
springs. These replace the standard head
stop. This is a simple job and one that is
worth doing.
This does not stop the 'hammering' of
the drive but it does make the hammering
very quiet and less damaging. After ﬁtting
the 'quiet stop' run the test again to
ensure that it is in the correct position.
Conclusion
This is  a  good buy  i f  y ou envisage
problems. Of course if you head is so far
out of line already you will not be able to
load the diagnostics anyway. It is a useful
thing t o  have and one whic h most
Commodore owners would ﬁnd useful at
some time in their drive's life.
At [39,95 it is not cheap but could pay
for itself. It is available from: Evesham
Micros, Telephone 0386 41989 or  021-

COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by a mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT) means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.
Any character that is accessed by pressing
shift and a  letter will b e printed as
[Sletterl.

Any character that is  accessed b y

- the sophisticated spreadsheet
Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs.
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BLISICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PET/CBM 4000 & 8000 series.
Available through dealers or from:
Supersoft, Winchester House, Canning Road, H a r r ow HA3 7S-1
